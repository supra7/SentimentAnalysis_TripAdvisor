We all loved it. We had a suite overlooking the marina. The view from our room was wonderful! Sailboats and water and beautiful houses on the hillside across the water. The room was great. Spotless. The entire hotel was spotless. The beds were comfortable. The service was excellent. The front desk responded to our needs immediately. The staff was incredibly professional and courteous. The hotel is very close to the airport and very close to downtown. It's about half an hour to Legoland and to the Wild Safari Park, but the drive is beautiful. The pool was heated and the kids loved it. The hotel was very quiet at night. I was really pleased with this hotel. My husband and I travel a lot and when we travel without the kids we stay in 5 star resorts so I'm always hesitant when staying in a less expensive hotel, but this hotel really surpassed all of my expectations. It was really lovely. I would go back in a heartbeat.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Culver City, California", "Title": "\u201cSnooze and Cruise (or fly)\u201d", "Author": "traveldan21", "ReviewID": "UR126953027", "Content": "Booked a Snooze and Cruise rate at the hotel website. I thought it was a pretty fair deal for a double queen room, ocean view at Casa Marina building. Although we paid for only 1 night, we got to leave our car in their covered garage for a week without nightly charges. Plus, their free shuttle van took us to the airport in the morning to catch our flight out to Hawaii. (If you are doing the Snooze and Cruise/Fly thing, also check out Humphrey's Half Moon Bay Inn which is located virtually next door to the Island Palms Hotel, and appears to be a sister hotel to this one. Humphrey's also has a similar Snooze and Cruise deal, although the price likely will be a little higher.) The room itself was very nice with reasonably updated furnishings. And the view from the second floor window and balcony was beautiful, overlooking the marina and the hills of Point Loma. After checking in in the afternoon, I spent a good hour sitting on the balcony, enjoying the view and taking advantage of the free wi-fi. Couldn't be more pleasant. The location on Shelter Island is central to a lot of San Diego, but not really walking distance to anywhere. So, don't stay here unless you have a car to get around. For a stay at a reasonably priced, clean and well maintained hotel before a cruise or flight out, you can't really beat this place. As an added plus, the front desk clerk was very friendly and seemed eager to be of service. Seems hard to believe, but too many \"service industry\" people don't seem to like to serve. Love to patronize those who still know what service means. I can highly recommend Best Western Plus Island Palms Hotel. If you have any reservations about a Best Western, don't hesitate to try this one.

Here are some pics from my current room. My room last time was identical to this only two doors down. I requested this part of the hotel because it has a small garden outside and overlooks the marina. I love sitting after work with a cup of tea (there is a fridge, coffee machine and microwave in the room) and kicking back. The map I've posted is the hotel floor plan. The back of the hotel overlooks the marina although both sides overlook water. I like being in the back on either the right or left sides. My favorite rooms are 145-148 149-152 162-165 in the Island Palms and the corner rooms in the Casa Del Mar. All overlook the marina in the back. Room service is pretty good although not a huge choice. The Salmon with fingerling pots and green beans is $20 plus 18% added and its good.

I vacationed here frequently as a child in the 80s and attended college in San Diego because of my vacation experiences. I moved to Seattle four years ago and this is still my favorite place to stay when I visit. It is really is the best value out there (wait for the sales). Shelter Island really is a slice of paradise and is still nostalgic San Diego. It is centrally located but still offers the serenity and relaxation I look for on a trip. I choose this resort over Loews Coronado because of the parking, resort and internet daily fees! The Palms offers free plentiful parking, wireless internet, tennis and bike rentals. There is no daily resort fee and you have access to many waterfront activities. In addition, the food at the Blue Wave is reasonably priced. I recommend calling the resort and discussing your travel needs prior to booking online or with a 3rd party. The property has three buildings and several room options to choose from. I had booked a traditional room and was put in the Casa Del Mar. I have to say I was disappointed in the room. It would have been sufficient had I been traveling alone on business. It is very small and boutique like, my boyfriend and I were on top of each other. In addition, the fridge was located in the bathroom and we were missing our microwave. I brought my concerns to the attention of the night manager and he allowed me to upgrade to a Junior Suite (what is should have booked). I planned to work during our vacation and my spouse did not and I had family visiting one day. The Junior Suite was much more appropriate for our needs.

Ideally I prefer to book direct with hotel - but BW weren't offering anything like the discount available thro several online booking agents so I took my chances on room allocation. This hotel was as near perfection as my budget is ever going to allow in San Diego! Location 10/10 Shelter Island was an idyllic location for our purposes. With picturesque and interesting Marina on one side and far reaching Bay views on the other. So serene and peaceful. For anyone who likes to start their day with a run or a walk this place is perfect with paths pretty much right around the island, safe, pristine and precious little traffic. In addition to the water, views and boats there are plenty of other diversions - statues, fishing piers, playparks. I read somewhere their was no beach at Shelter Island - certainly compared to what else is available locally but I spotted at least two small [imported?] sandy areas. Pleasant stroll or very short drive back up to Shelter Island village for provisions or wider choice of restaurants/bars etc. - Getting there a piece of cake from the airport. Hotel offers a free shuttle but we selected to pick up our rental car first - Doh! Alamo shuttle took us right downtown - but no big deal seemed like just a five minute [evening time] drive back to Shelter Island [somewhat longer in daytime traffic]. Check In/Out 10/10 Checking in took moments. The receptionist was warm, welcoming and superbly efficient. She gave us brief clear directions re parking [free] & how to find room. I had booked a \"Traditional\" room which can come in one or two doubles. As we had our 12 yr old daughter with us I added a note to our booking requesting one with two beds if available but I know the score, so no expectations. Well she made no mention of upgrading us but I find it hard to believe the room we were allocated is their base rate room. Check out was similarly efficient. There were half a dozen folk ahead of me with two staff on reception and a third receptionist appeared. No nasty surprises on bill. And best of all - check out is not till midday. Enabling you to take your time and enjoy last morning on vacation. More hotels please take note guests really really appreciate this! Room: 10/10 Fabulous from the moment you enter. Smells fresh, Immaculate, spacious, really lovely contemporary decor, Generous Balcony. Attractive wooden shutters and full wall of windows overlooking marina just a few yards beyond. Microwave/Fridge/Coffee Machine/Iron etc. Plentiful and good coffee! Mugs & glasses. Appeared also to be a playsation or some sort of games controller supplied tho we didn't use. But it was the beds that really blew us away. We were just mocking the laminated \"boast\" sheet supplied to advise guests just how special their beds are - when we sat down on them. and almost didn't get up again to explore San Diego. Really BW no laminated sheet required. These beds scream for themselves. They even have individual bedside controls if you prefer harder or softer mattress! Bedding superb, oh so soft cotton sheets. Although all the parking spaces around our building were taken we felt as if we were only folk there - no noise from other rooms at all, save for very occasional plumbing pipe creaks that seem common to every hotel I've ever stayed in. Woken only by ducksong. If I'm nitpicking here there is only a central bedside table - so nowhere for person on outerside of beds to control their bedside light or place a glass of water etc. Nor could I find a power point near the beds. But only real issue was TV remote. They have these \"superhygienic\" new remotes - we couldn't get our TV to work at all the first night, would have reported this to reception but couldn't get our phone to work either. We were jetlagged so not a problem - we left a note for housekeeping and sure enough both phone and TV remote working on our return later next day.The remote was only partially working but enough to get us local San Diego channel. But on day 3 again couldn't get any response other than switch on/off. If it mattered to us I have no doubt at all this could have been sorted with a single call but we were just too busy enjoying the views, the spas and the beds. Bathroom 9/10 Immaculate, spacious, good water pressure and temperature control on the shower. Toilet flush virtually silent. Plentiful and plush towels and good in-room toiletries supplied. The half-depth bath was new to me. Are these common? I come from a land of more than our fair share of rainfall so I'm conscientious to generally avoid baths if I'm somewhere where water is scarce - but I confess curiosity got the better of me and I had to try it out. Perfectly fine though I had a wee bit of mopping up to do afterwards! Just a couple of comments - no glass or anywhere to place toothbrushes? Cmon! And a shaving/makeup mirror would be so helpful. Also noted no liners in the trashcan - thumbs up environmentally [tho can't be much fun for the maids?]. Pool/Spa 10/10 We visited during a particularly cold spell. But we are from Scotand escaping to California in February - nothing was going to keep us out of the pool. We spent some time in the attractively landscaped main area by bar restaurant which has a very generous and deep pool and spa But in fact we preferred the rather plainer small pool & spa closer to our building - due to the unobstructed marina views and good windscreen. Both pool and spa temperatures were absolutely spot on for the season. Nor did we have any skin reactions to cleaning chemicals - Highest commendations to whoever is maintaining these! We had a great time here. Would I return / recommend ? Absolutely! Significantly, as my review is doubtless colored by the discounted low season rate I paid, do I consider this hotel to be worth its full rack rate?

Upon arrival, I found out that we had been assigned to a ground floor unit a few steps away from the main lobby. I'm pretty bad with spatial intelligence, so it took the front desk receptionist several attempts to explain the hotel's layout to me. Apparently, all the rooms were in adjacent 2-story structures to the check-in area, separate \"condo-like\" units that are completely self-contained (i.e., there is no common hallway). I found it interesting that the units had a small, gated patio in front (see photos). Although I didn't use it myself, my neighbors spent a good deal of time outside smoking and discussing their exploits. The interior of the room itself was as expected--bed, TV, and bathroom. There was no tub (if that's what you are looking for), but the overall floor plan was sufficient for two people (maybe three). An air conditioning unit was available, but I opted to turn on the ceiling fan instead to circulate the air. There was also an in-room safe you could store stuff in by entering your own 4-digit code. I felt that the room was clean and comfortable. A microwave and mini-fridge were also available. The only issue I had was with the noise that would occasionally seep in from next door. I don't know if this was because my neighbors were unusually rowdy, their sleeping patterns diverged significantly from mine, or if the walls were flimsy, but late in the evening, and even up to 3 in the morning or thereabouts, I would hear banging sounds and laughter from time to time. When they were sitting outside in their patio area, I could hear chunks of the conversation, so perhaps they were practicing oration. Whatever the case, this was only a minor irritant. Passing traffic is barely audible, but you may hear the sounds of passersby on the way back to their rooms. The hotel itself is located on a strip of land (can't tell if it is a natural or man-made peninsula) that is accessible via the main stretch of road called Shelter Island Drive. As a result, the location is somewhat out of the way if you are looking to be in the city proper itself, but I actually enjoyed having free parking (abundant) and relative peacefulness after a full day's worth of activities. That being said, you will NOT be stranded in the middle of nowhere--everything is a reasonable drive away. Directly in front of the unit is a stretch of park where I encountered many joggers and other vacationers. You can also see the airport from that vantage point (approx. 10 min. drive). Behind the unit is a marina. There are a LOT of boats moored here (see photo). I think I've covered pretty much everything. Bottom line: if you don't mind straying a little from the city, what you have here is a nice place to recoup from your adventures and plot your next course of action. Of course, this all assumes you will be renting a car because taking a taxi from here would get ridiculously expensive really quickly. Hope this helps with your decision.

We asked for a higher floor and the front desk clerk, Ajia, was very accommodating and helpful. She offered us a room on the top (3rd) floor. She also showed us a jr. suite and a full suite (extra cost for both), but we opted for the third floor room, which turned out to be a good decision. The room wasn't ready so we had dinner in the hotel's restaurant while we waited for the room to be cleaned. 90 minutes later - not ready yet. Ajia apologized and offered to buy us a drink in the bar while we waited a few more minutes. Room cleaned - checked in - great view of the marina. Definitely request a higher floor if you go. Otherwise, morning walkers and dogs doing their morning \"business\" will greet you as you awake and look out your patio windows. Some of those boat dwellers certainly need to learn how to carry plastic bags and pick up their dog's droppings. I suggest the hotel should complain to the marina management about this. We saw a few dogs being allowed to pee on the sidewalk (watch the wet trails, morning walkers) and another very lazy couple with a big black great dane and a smaller white dog just kick rocks over their dog's feces pile. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. They have adjustable mattresses so each side can be adjusted to each sleeper's desired firmness. The bright nightlight on the clock radio may be disturbing and unplugging it means you won't have an alarm clock. A folded towel laid over the light did the trick. Maybe there is a way to turn it off, but I didn't see it. The in room coffee maker is nice, but it would be nicer if there were some \"to go\" coffee cups so guests can take a cup along.

Booked this place looking for a deal. The hotel is 80's dated but very clean. The front desk staff are courteous and helpful. The suites are what I stayed in. Very roomy and a nice patio to sit out on so long as San Diego isn't having record cold. Which brings me to my only complaint. There is no weather stripping between the door and the frame. In the morning I could see daylight coming through all four sides of the door. Considering it was hitting the mid 40's at night, that meant a lot of cold air coming in. Which in turn meant I had to run the wall heater all night and it was rather noisy. However,that was my only complaint. The bed sheets and comforter are white and that means no surprises. The TV is huge and there are plenty of channels to watch. There are mini fridges and the bathrooms are updated in granite. The mattress had a sunken spot which means it's time buy some new ones. The TV remote battery was dead and the little cover on the rear was screwed shut so I couldn't replace it. Overall, I really liked the place. It's right by the marina and if you're boating that's a plus. You can go on a nice jog along the marina too. SAN flight path is nearby but it's quiet here. You barely hear the planes. North Island NAS has a lot of aircraft coming and going including rotors but again, nothing you really can hear in the rear facing rooms. Parking is free. Breakfast is not even though they told me it was included during my phone call. Besides, there are plenty of great breakfast joints within a 15 minute drive. Avoid the bar in the evenings.

Our view of the marina and the thousands of boats was fabulous although the weather was not really up to sitting on the balcony! From check in to check out the staff were all first rate. Especially the bar staff who worked really hard to keep everyone happy. The happy hour menu was exceptional value and despite not really being a bar person I spent an hour or so there every night - as did many others - it was a great atmosphere and seems to be used by both locals and vacationers. The food in the restaurant is also very good and we ate there three times. We used the free bikes to cycle around the marina one morning and had great fun. Also used the laundry facilities which were cheap and fast - perfect to do your laundry whilst having a drink upstairs! The area is great and we walked to several other hotel restaurants at night and also went into the fantastic Humphreys live venue a couple of times. You do need a car as other attractions and also downtown are some distance away but it is a nice area to stroll around too and the views are to die for. The only possible thing I would mark this hotel down for is the breakfast. I booked their bed an breakfast rate which was an additional $20 dollars thinking this would be good value. However, it only includes a limited choice of hot dish and no beverage. As all the breakfast dishes are less than $10 each this does not represent value for money.

We stayed in a queen suite which was perfect for 4 of us. We loved the little kitchen for breakfasts and snacks. The suite is nicely updated, spacious, airy and very clean. Beds were super comfy. We preferred the bay view as opposed to the marina view. The parking lot and street out front were very quiet at night. We enjoyed watching the boats and had a view of downtown San Diego. Our kitchen window had a small view of the marina too. The pools were both beautiful and warm. We didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment. We were able to use the computer and printer in the lobby for boarding passes. Reception was efficient, helpful and friendly. Shelter Island makes for a great location for touring San Diego and has a beautiful walking path too. It was all good until our final night when a group of young people decided to party very loudly throughout the entire night in the suite beside ours. They started at 10:30 and did not stop until 6:00 a.m.!! The toilet flushed (very noisily) no less than 40 times throughout the night, bar stools screeched across the floor, doors slammed, footsteps of 10 or 12 partiers pounded up and down the outside steps right by our window and extremely loud voices carried on all night long inside and out. Where was the security in a big hotel like this?? We finally called the front desk at 2:40 a.m. and they sent someone over to check it out. However this was just a temporary solution. A few of the partiers left (with drinks in hand), but returned at 4:30 even louder. Again.. no security. Finally their lights went out at 6:00 a.m. and we slept a whole hour! Where was security all this time? And how could they not have noticed all the noise and commotion much earlier?? A quick walk around the parking lot and rooms on a regular basis is all that is required. We have been to numerous hotels and resorts in Mexico and Hawaii and situations like this would never happen. Security is constantly cruising the parking lots and guest room areas to ensure all is quiet. We are very disappointed that this was not the case at BW Island Palms.

The only issue we had was with the shuttle. It's complimentary - they are flexible - they picked us up at ship terminal and drove us to airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then they drove us back and forth to our car rental (thrifty on pacific ave near airport is cheapest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good service) so they are generous with this service.

We were the only one left standing in the hot sun waiting. Their excuse was shuttle does not start until 11 am that day. So half hour to get there they figured they were on time. Tell that to the 10 people left waiting!!! Then they found there were too many to pick up so the driver (in this case the hotel manager) suggested we wait another hour for him to get back. To even suggest that was insulting!! I made a point of suggesting the hotel comp a taxi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which he agreed to without hesitation. Other experiences with shuttle we later learned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when you book a shuttle for pick up at say 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they take it to mean they will leave the hotel at 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c keep that in mind. They have free bikes, nicely situated by the harbour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you are very far from catching public transit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c keep that in mind when you book here.

They also brought out apples, bananas, and some lettuce salads later on, but it was dinnertime and we wanted something way more substantial than fruit or lettuce. We went to several local businesses until we were able to locate a convenience store that was open and selling things in the dark without the use of any cash register, etc. To top things off, when I questioned at the front desk if there was any plan in place for food, I got attitude from the front desk clerk! We checked out the next day. Did not like the location of the hotel. We ended up checking out the next morning and went to a Comfort Inn and Suites where we were very happy.

The shower head worked well and sprayed water evenly and all the plumbing and air conditioned worked well. There was a large flat screen television. There is an on site spa with a variety of massage packages. This is a great place to stay if you like to jog, as Shelter Island is a nice self contained little community with good jogging trails and great views of North Island and Point Loma. Parking is directly in front of the units, but not quite enough to handle the load and so if you check in late, you might find yourself walking a long distance to get to your room. From the outside, the hotel does not look that great and is showing its ago...sixty plus years but inside is another matter entirely and I found the rooms to be very nice. So if you want a nice room with a view of the harbor and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, this is a place to try out. You will be only a few minutes from the airport and downtown.

I think this year we've found the one. What makes this hotel so special and worth the not inconsiderable $$$ is its location. We opted for a marina view room and were not disappointed. We've stayed at hotels where marina views mean getting a glimpse of the ocean between two trees 100 yards away. Here you get exactly what it says on the tin. We had a perfect ground floor room with unobstructed marina view only a few feet from the water separated only by a pedestrian path screened by shrubs. Our room had outside seats and a table and it was very relaxing to unwind at the end of the evening with a few beers and a good book. The added bonus was that the fireworks from Seaworld were clearly visible each evening. The hotel is on an 'island' which means its surrounded on three sides by water. The lobby side faces a strip of parkland suitable for walkers and cyclists and offers good views of the bay and any aircraft carriers in port. The room itself was very clean and well maintained. Beds were very comfortable and the bathroom modern with a spacious shower. Reception staff were friendly. Breakfast was the only disappointment. Not so much the food but rather the poor service. There is nothing more annoying that seeing people arrive for breakfast 15 minutes after you've sat down and they are served first and finished before we even got our food. They got what I'd regard as normal service whereas our server was attrocious. The service the following day was slightly better but not fantsastic given the prices. The food was fine and the location, overlooking the marina, is excellent and refreshing. The hotel is conveniently located but will require a car to get the most out of. Parking is plentiful although given the layout of the hotel it is unlikely to be parked outside of your room. If looking for something to do check out the Midway aircraft carrier museum. If visiting the museum make sure to go early in the day as its at least 4 hours of a tour and it closes at 5.30. The tour of the bridge may close even earlier. A useful tip if travelling from Anaheim is to check out any of the attraction booklets in the hotel rooms in Anaheim. A book in our room contained cut-out coupons that allowed children to get in free which was far more valuable to us than a dollar or two off general admission. Security at the hotel was very prominent with a security guard passing our room regularly as I downed the beers!

The property has a nice on site restaurant, the Blue Wave Bar & Grill. The food was excellent for the price range. Room: average sized, with balcony. Coffee maker and a safe are also in the room (no charge). Cleanliness was good. The only issue was a slow draining sink in the washroom. Parking: free, but can fill up at night. Amenities: there are two pool areas, both of modest size. One (it seems) is more noisy with families. A free USA Today is available in the lobby, too.

Independent of anything to do with the hotel, its staff, the room, etc., if I don't sleep well a hotel is out for me. We normally sleep in our room and not much more. My problem with the room? It had shutters rather than curtains over the front windows. That's a problem as soon as the sun starts to come up. We had a great view of the water, BUT the sun rose over the water and woke us up bright and early! UGH! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be completely honest, part of the problem was that we had a late night at Disneyland and then drove down to SD the same night, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be out of the question to sleep in past sunrise. Our room was had kind of a funky decor. We had a king bed and a couple of chairs in our room. Along the wall opposite the bed there was this long dresser-type thing that held the TV on top, the refrigerator & microwave inside, and drawers for clothes. This piece of furniture was pretty worn looking. The bathroom had a toilet, nice long countertop with a sink, and a shower stall. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not against only having a shower, but this shower was rather dark (no lights in or near the shower) and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a place to store all of our shower goodies (shampoo, shower gels, face wash, etc. from home). The heat/ac came from an in-wall unit. Parking was close, in front of our room or very close by. We had a little gate into an area outside of our room where we entered. From our doorway we could see the water. It was pretty cool when we saw the USS Carl Vinson ship out (didn't know it was going to be until I heard about it on the news and then opened my door!). The staff was fine. The room was clean. Our bed was comfy. I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle being up at sunrise because the room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have curtains.

Both the room and bathroom are large, clean and well-decorated. There are electric sockets everywhere, including at lamp bases. The plasma TV had most major channels. There was a good refrigerator, and wi-fi was free and fast. The view of the marina and hills from the porch is very pretty. Our room 670 was on the top floor at the end of Villa Marina, the building farthest from the reception area, near the tennis courts. It was easy to move suitcases from the parking spaces to the room through an extra-large elevator. Location The location is on Shelter Island only about 15 minutes from downtown and less than 10 minutes from the airport. On one side of the string of hotel buildings, there is a view of the road, parking lot, and harbor. On the other side, there is a view of the marina and the hills. We chose the marina view because we enjoy watching water birds and sailboats. We didn't eat at the restaurant because there are so many good restaurants nearby. We had a good lunch at the Brigantine Restaurant at Shelter Island Drive. Parking As you face the office, there are two loading and unloading parking places to the right side. When you check in, they provide a parking pass for the duration of your stay. At midnight it was a challenge to find an empty parking space in the complex, but eventually we found a place. Service We rarely saw the staff, but when we did, they were helpful. One of the maids offered to help bring our suitcases to the car. Check-in and check-out were fast and easy. At the office, they held our suitcases until our room was ready because we arrived earlier than the 4 p.m. check-in. Quiet enjoyment There was no neighbor noise, but there were more than usual family hall-caucuses during daylight hours. Maybe sailing families need to talk loud enough to be heard above the wind. We didn't try to sleep during daylight hours, and we probably couldn't. No problem sleeping soundly at night. The bed and pillows were comfortable.

Overall I had an excellent stay. My room in the Casa Marina portion was clean,with a laundry service,safe,fridge,free internet and view of the marina.The bed was supposed to be some \"Revolutionary Sleep System\" that had a dial for comfort, but I never adjusted the setting, I slept well enough each night. Though the walls/ceiling are a bit thin if you`re a light sleeper. There are 2 hot tubs which were great after many long hours walking all day, and a Spa (which I never took part). There are 2 salt water pools, the one near my room was only 3ft deep, but the one up near the Bar/Restaurant is 81/2 feet deep in parts, which is rare. *However some people may feel a little self conscious sun bathing or swimming around this pool as diners on the outside patio are constantly looking down on you. My only complaints - the menu though reasonably priced has a lot of fish dishes and I`m not a fan. I wish there were more meat selections as a $22 steak every night got a little boring. Also, I was here a week but didn`t rent a car, you`ll probably need one. I relied on the Hotel's FREE shuttle to get me to and from the airport, and as I was in town for a convention, that venue provided FREE transportation to and from the event each day. But there is not much within walking distance on Shelter Island except shops catering to The Marina/Yacht crowd. There is a nice walkway that you can use to walk/jog around most of the island however with a coastal view. My only real compliant is that on my first night here I called the front desk and set up a Wake Up Call for the next morning but it never came. I eventually woke up an hour later on my own. I phoned the front desk and complained because if this had been the day I was leaving I could have missed my flight - as a consolation they provided me with a FREE breakfast. * Other than the fact that this Hotel and every other in San Diego jacks their prices (and perhaps their food costs as well) from Jul 21-24 for The Comic Convention. I see nothing else wrong with the place.

This hotel has over 500 reviews, so I will try to make my review organized and informative. We stayed here for 5 days in July on vacation. We had a total of 11 people in our family traveling, so we all ended up in 2 different buildings (2 rooms in the Island Palms & 2 rooms in the Casa Marina). One building would have been nice, but they didn't have rooms all together. (Large families/groups: book earlier than 2 months for busy times!) Rooms: The rooms in the Casa Marina were all indoors, and the rooms at the Island Palms opened straight to the outdoors. There is a 3rd building (Casa del Mar) in between, but to walk from the Casa Marina to the Palms was only like a 5 minute walk and nice if you walk by the marina! We were all right by the marina, so we had a nice view of the water and different boats. Across the street from the hotel, you can go walking by the ocean. All of our rooms were clean, but the room service fell a little short replenishing coffee and coffee cups. We did leave a little tip each day and asked for extra towels, which we got plenty of! You do have a nice selection of TV channels (at least 60). Location: Great location and no problem with noise! We were about 10 minutes away from Mission Beach, which was quite crowded. I was kind of glad we didn't choose a hotel there, because I think there was a higher chance of noise near our rooms. We were 45 minutes from Legoland, about 1.5 hours from Disneyland, and only about 15 minutes from Sea World and the San Diego Zoo, and 5-10 minutes from USS Midway and Gaslamp District. Our location made it very easy to access the interstate and main roads to these places. We were only 1-2 miles from main drugstores and larger grocery stores. Also if you like doughnuts, which all in our family do, a Winchell's was right down the street and around the corner. Good on-the-go breakfast ! Parking: free for all guests, but it seemed difficult to find a space in the evenings. Parking was also available across the street. Rate: We got a reasonable rate, an average of $140/night. We rented out a room with a kitchenette, a couple doubles with queen beds, and a double with twin beds, but that $140/night was an average of all rooms. I think this was a CostCo special. Check out the hotel's actual website: http://www.islandpalms.com/san-diego-hotels/index.cfm for prices as well. Overall: We enjoyed our stay here and had no problems with cleanliness (a MUST for me!) or noise. These qualities plus location made it worth it.

The building that includes the main lobby is very tropical, lush, and green and includes a nice tropical-style swimming pool. It also includes the on-site restaurant (we didn't try) that overlooks the pool. The atmosphere seemed a bit livelier than the Casa del Mar building where we stayed. The Casa del Mar building is more of a Mediterranean theme and quite beautiful. The pool is a bit smaller than the pool in the main building and seemed much quieter except for the 5 or 6 kids enjoying it. The view of the marina was very peaceful. The rooms are clean and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is fairly typical for a Best Western.

Our room was about the furthest from the pools and main lobby that they offered, but we still did not find the walk too bad. The hotel offers two pools areas and both are really beautiful with views of the marina and water. My only complaint was that the hot tubs were too hot to actually enjoy. I love heat and hot water and was still only able to enjoy it for about 2-3 minutes at a time before it got too hot and my boyfriend found it painful. Would have loved to take a swim in the pools but it was pretty cold and cloudy during out visit. One of the pools also offered a gas fireplace, but you need to call the front desk and ask for it to be turned on. A suggestion to the hotel would be to put out a little sign with instructions to call and the number - as we spent awhile trying to figure out how to turn it on ourselves. The hotel is out on a little island so you do have to take a short walk over the bridge to the mainland to get to other restaurants and it is about a 10 minute drive to get to places like Old Town and the Maritime museum.

For some reason, my in-law's room had a number of nicks and dings in the furniture and smudges on the walls. It could be that it was more often used or that it was a room for the handicapped (see later notes). Our room had two queen size beds, a small frig, microwave, dishes and silverware. It was just right for our family of four (includes two teens). Kudos to the staff - when we checked in, my in-laws were put in a room on the 2nd floor. There is no elevator in Casa del Mar.

Hotel is near San Diego Airport and the naval base so there was the occasional loud plane overhead, but since we weren't in our rooms much it didn't matter. The planes also did not fly at night (or it was such that we did not hear or notice). Also, at least Casa del Mar, while updated, is an \"older\" building.

If you are looking to be in the heart anything \"San Diego\" other than the marina, this hotel may not be for you. I was not at all impressed with this location or the layout of the hotel. The rates at this hotel seem to swing quite a bit, but when we were here there was an average deal. I was here for a conference and did not have a choice of hotel. I feel that there are much better options in Old Town if your wanting to stay on a similar budget but still be able to get to all the sights. (See my review of Holiday Inn Express Old Town) The lobby area is tiny and includes a check in desk, tiny exercise room, small bar area, and a restaurant. One of the two pools is adjacent to the lobby. One note to concern with this hotel.....though the rooms have an interior corridor, all first floor rooms look out on the marina or across the parking lot to the water front. Also, this hotel is a series of buildings, stretched out over about a 1/4 mile. You have to go outside to get from most of the rooms to the main lobby building. It was consistently a 10 minute walk from my building to the meeting rooms. These first floor rooms are not very secure in my opinion as there is not anything blocking out access to your patio. Between the scattered buildings, dark walkways, and first floor rooms I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is security conscious. There also appears to be several people living in \"campers\" across the street from the hotel. There are not many good dining choices in walking distance. No convenience stores, and no fast dining options. You absolutely need a car to be happy at this location. Check in was efficient and friendly. They would not accommodate my request for a king bed, but they do have two queen beds in the double rooms. The rooms are of nice size, acceptable size and yet nicely equipped. Oddly, the bathroom door has an auto closer so it does not interfere with the front door...I had to cram a shampoo bottle in the door so as to let the bathroom vent when taking a shower.. Poor layout! Room decoration is warm and inviting and seemed to have been recently remodeled. The beds are sleep number, which I am not a fan of but they were good beds otherwise. The rooms have nice desk space, internet for (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if there is a fee...they gave us access codes as part of our group package). They have nice HDTV's and an acceptable number of channels. Rooms have microwaves and fridges in them. The great thing about this location is that it is surrounded by water and you can get some nice but short runs in. Climate Control is acceptable and you can leave the blower on for white noise and still have the AC or Heat running. Their business center consists of one pc and printer in the lobby. They have two acceptable pools, both overlooking the marina. There is no breakfast included in the room rate, which for a Best Western is hit or miss. The food in the restaurant was acceptable given you were basically a captive audience. If you can get away, absolutely do so! The banquet food was acceptable but uninspired. The gym is way too small and unacceptable. Fortunately I went out running in the beautiful weather instead. Unless I did not have a choice, or got a killer deal, this would not be my choice at all, mainly because of the remote location (though easy driving distance to everything) and the stretched out layout of the facility. I just find that I prefer to be able to walk to at least a few places if I choose.

It was wonderful!! In some pictures they make the room look bigger than it really is. This was reverse. I couldn't believe how big the room was!! The bottom floor had a living room with tv/office work space for my husband. The couch was a pull out, but we didn't need it. A full bath too, so downstairs could be for a family or part of a family. Then there was a table near the kitchen. The kitchen had a small fridge, so we didn't get much things that needed to be cold. We got some cereal and fruit for breakfast in the room. There was a door that opened to the back view/pool area. Outside the door was a small table. So some mornings we would have the door open for air, or even sit outside. The kids would run around out in the grassy area or watch bugs on the cement. The pool was about 20 steps from our door. It was great! It was small, heated, and perfect. You could see the fireworks at Sea World every night. The upstairs to the room you have to go up a spiral staircase. There is another door to the upper floor of the hotel, but there isn't an elevator either. When upstairs you can shut the door so that no wandering kids would fall down the stairs at night. There is a full bath in the hallway. One room has a king with window, AC, dresser, tv. The other has the same, then a door to the upstairs balcony, and a full bath. The beds were very comfortable!! The AC on and the area of town, it was very quiet at night. We had room service 2 mornings for hot eggs, meat. Food was great. We never ate in their restaurant.

Sure its by the Marina and Bay but what can you do with that? Sneak into a boat and take a spin? Nope. There is absolutely nothing around this area. Scrappy neighborhoods, near a typical big road lined with fast food joints (Rosecrans) and thats it. I kicked myself for not staying downtown at 4 star Hilton or Indigo downtown. Sure you gotta pay for parking but at least you get some LIFE around you. Endless restaurants are downtown in walking distance, promenade, museums, movie theatres, cruise ships, clubs, Aircraft carrier, Little Italy, etc. This hotel is located on the 'darks side of the moon' and nothing happening there are anywhere near! In this hotel **You have to drive just to get anything worthwhile**. price should have been half. THE ROOMS- are just like a Hampton Inn; Boring and unimaginative. The hotel site photos sell the 'belle of the ball' rooms with super photography. 90% of the rest arent like that when you are in them. I saw several in two different buildings as I walked around hoping there was better than what I got (casa del mar section). Older section was just as boring and basic. If you can score a hotel downtown 4 star with Hotwire for $90 like I saw, do it. Then you are right in the mix.

It was very clean and comfortable. Every room was large. The bathroom had ample room for multiple people to shower and get ready (no tub). The bedroom had a closet in addition to several dresser drawers. The \"living\" area had a large flat screen TV, couch and coffee table. The kitchen had glasses, mugs, plates, silverware, a full sized coffee maker (though no filters), a pantry, and a full sized refrigerator. These amenities were especially useful given that it was raining outside which meant we spent more time in the hotel room than usual. There's children's play set across the street next to the water. As an aside, if you want to stock up the pantry, your closest grocery stores are off Rosecrans and Womble. There's a Trader Joe's and a Vons. If you go to that complex, do yourself a favor and have a meal at the Tender Greens restaurant. It's freshly prepared daily specials are fast, delicious, and healthy. The restaurant attached to the hotel has a great vibe and view, but the food is so-so. The queen suite we stayed in did have a latch up high enough so that the toddler couldn't open the door.

In fact, we had to walk from the parking lot, in the grass on stepping stones to get to the room on the back of the building. We did not even go in the room, as the safety issue with two small children was too great. I requested a different room, which they provided at the opposite end of the complex. Parking was good, room was small, the front door opened about an inch or two from the foot of one of the beds. It was a long evening, as my toddler loved playing w/the blinds which opened up right to the parking lot and could easily open the deadbolt on the door, which opened directly to the parking lot. Again, a safety and privacy issue for us. The room was partially renovated (bathroom only) a bug crawled out of the shower mat, carpet was worn, linens worn, but the TV was brand new. Wonderful view though, nice patio, great little walking path and beach area across the street, and the hot tub was not bad. The pool, although heated was too cool this time of year. We checked out early due to the safety and privacy issues, but also it just was not what we expected and was the most expensive place we stayed in California. We were later informed we could have upgraded, but for the price we expected more than they delivered.

Well, these fact turned out to be very true. It is a very quite area. What the pictures and the reviews don't explain is that there is a very nice landscaped parkway across the street which is a great place to take a run, a after dinner walk, or to just sit on the benches and enjoy the view. The hotel is very easy to find and is close to the highways. The check in was effortless and the room was super nice. We stayed in the Casa Marina building and the room was updated, fresh, and new. The finishes (tile, wallpaper, etc) were very tasteful and upscale. The balcony overlooked the marina and was private enough to have morning coffee and overlook the boats. The hotel has two pools and two hot tubs, but a word of warning that at least the main pool was a salt water pool. I prefer a fresh water pool, but this one was very clean and still enjoyable. The staff was very friendly. On our first day, we went for a swim and was promptly greeted by Sunny who offered to get us a couple of drinks poolside. We walked by some of the other rooms on our way to the pool and they looked very nice as well but were efficiencies on two levels and they had a full kitchen so it looked like a great option for an extended stay. We optioned for the Seaworld Tickets through the hotel and to our surprise they were 5 day return tickets! All in all, a very nice experience. Breakfast was included with the room which was very nice, but they do charge for the drinks. i would never eat breakfast at their restaurant if I did not have the package deal because otherwise it would cost $30 + just for breakfast for two people.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Covina, California", "Title": "\u201cBiggest Surprise In San Diego\u201d", "Author": "oldschool19461", "ReviewID": "UR84678594", "Content": "Outstanding staff, restraunt, maintenence.

It was in the older part of the complex but exceptionally maintained, and I cannot say a bad thing about the room at all. My newlywed wife was thrilled to say the least, as was I.

It is close to everything, and easy to get into downtown or wherever you want to go. We wanted to take a trolley tour, and just missed the Old Town Trolley, and would have wait another 40 mins. The staff at the front desk saw that we were disappointed, and immediately offered to drive us to Old Town.

Our check-in was good with the Receptionist providing us with alot of detail about the Hotel and the local area. Our room was in the newer building (Casa Del Mar) and on the second floor overlooking the Marina. The room was spacious, clean and well furished. We utalised the pool during our stay as well as the Restaurant for Breakfast (Bfast was included in our package). While the service at Reception was always good, the service in the Restaurant was terrible. The waiters/waitresses were far from friendly and unaccommodating. The food was also average. The free internet in the lobby was handy as was the self-serve laundry. Another good feature of the Hotel was the shuttle bus with the porter offering to drop us into Old Town etc a couple of times. If you were to put the service in the Restaurant aside, this Hotel is pretty good. Keep in mind also, if you don't have a car, the bus stop (for buses into Old Town) is a 15min brisk walk from the Hotel. The bus trip into Old Town is approx 20-25mins and then the Trolley from Old Town to Santa Fe is approx 8mins. The buses run up until 10-11pm and are reliable, safe and cheap.

The hotel is located on Shelter Island, a small peninsula located in between a private marina and the beautiful San Diego bay. It's just minutes away from pretty much every landmark and point of interest in San Diego. The location is convenient enough to get anywhere in about 10-20 minutes, but is also sheltered and out of the way of all the big city noises and distractions. The hotel was very nice and clean. The overall property has a secluded Hawaii theme, which makes it all the more relaxing. There are two pools, both which were kept clean and warm. There is also a fitness center, although it is a little small, and I would probably recommend taking a jog along the bayside instead of using the fitness center. We stayed in the Casa Marina building. We were told it was brand new, and it most certainly was. We got a room with two queens and a rollaway mattress, and it was still spacious enough for the four of us. The room was clean and was always stocked with amenities. The staff, however, is this hotel's greatest asset. Everyone was very friendly and always asked us if there was anything we needed or wanted. The housekeepers always gave us everything we requested. The front desk was especially awesome. They were very helpful and seemed to be very interested in making us happy and comfortable. John pretty much acted as our personal concierge by recommending restaurants, telling us which sites and places to visit, and always arranging transportation for us. And Greg was wonderful when he offered to print our boarding passes when we couldn't figure out how to use the printer at the hotel's provided computer terminal.

The pool is very warm and a pleasure to swim in. The whirlpool was a bit hot for my personal liking - others may find it great. Our room was on the side of Shelter Island which faces Shelter Island Drive. The other side faces the marina. Both have advantages. We watched as the USS Carl Vincent Aircraft Carrier came in to port. Wouldn't have seen that if we had been on the marina side. Staff was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. There was a nasty rain storm the one night we were there and a small leak developed. We reported the problem and they comped our room in full for that night which was more then fair. The source of the leak was quickly identified and easily fixed - we kept the room. Only a nasty driving rain would have caused the leak in the first place. The room had a king sized bed, ceramic tiled bathroom floor, good sized updated ceramic tiled shower, granite bathroom counter, flat screen TV, two stuffed barrel chairs, and an outdoor patio with patio chairs facing the channel. The decor was updated and fresh. If you don't like upstairs neighbors we would recommend that you try to get an second floor unit as this is an older hotel and you can hear the pitter patter of little feet on the ceiling. Our room was $126 per night and since we didn't plan to spend much time in it was a good value for a place to sleep.

The new building and renovations were still underway at that time. We checked in and were given a room with a view of construction fencing. We didn't want construction noise, and preferred at least some kind of view, so we asked, and were switched to another room. It was an older room, but clean. It was a ground floor room with a view of the marina. We thought it peculiar that the in-room refrigerator was in the bathroom (though the bathroom was nice). Our biggest complaints about the room were: 1. the noise of the marina gate constantly slamming shut and 2. the location right by the laundry facility. Overall, we weren't very impressed with our stay. When emailed a survey from the hotel, my traveling partner responded honestly. The manager apologized for the inconvenience and offered to help us with our return stay, if we'd like. Fast forward to March 2010. As promised, the manager helped us with a nice room and a good rate. We were in the newest building, 3rd floor, overlooking the marina. Once again, we were near a marina gate, but this time it closed silently. My traveling partner is a stickler for cleanliness, so he checked the room. There were crumbs of food on the sofa, a sticky stain on the armrest of the chair, a sticky bathroom floor, ring marks on the bathroom vanity, and a pen mark on the sheets. We weren't thrilled, especially since the manager had helped us to book our stay (perhaps he would've made sure our room was clean?), but were eager to get out to the beach for sunset. When we returned from our evening out, I began to unpack our suitcases. I was shocked to find someone else's dirty laundry in our drawers! I'm not the finicky one, and I told my companion that we'd talk to the front desk first thing in the morning (as I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep). When we headed out for the day, we spoke with Danny at the front desk. He was courteous and made note of our concerns. He said he would contact the housekeeping manager so it would be taken care of. We returned again that evening, and our room had been serviced (i.e. the bed made, towels refreshed, vacuumed, etc.). However, not ONE of our concerns had been addressed. Highly disappointing. We checked out the next morning, and Danny was shocked to learn that our concerns hadn't been taken care of. We were offered 15% off our next stay as compensation, but I'm pretty sure we won't be returning. Too bad, because we love the location and the free parking. Besides the cleanliness, we noticed many other things: The elevator in this building looked like a freight elevator, so we thought we had made a wrong turn (we hadn't). This was a new room, and there were paint marks on furniture, the sliding glass door, etc. Also, the front door should close securely for safety, however ours slammed shut to the point it hurt our ears. There was no way to keep the bathroom door open. The wallpaper looked as if it were put up hastily, as it seemed to be peeling in places.

I stayed at this hotel for one night since we were going for my brothers bootcamp graduation from the Marines(checked in at 6pm Thursday night and checked out at 7am Friday). The young lady that checked us was really nice but it seemed like she was still training since she asked the gentlemen working with her to help with the keys because she was having problems with the key machine. The gentleman didn't seem too happy since he never smiled!! Anyways, we went to our 2 rooms that we had booked with the 2 queen beds and we were impressed when we walked in! (room 506 & 508) They had a really nice view and had really nice furniture (the beds and little sitting area seats were so comfortable)! Then we went into the bathroom area and we were REALLY impressed in how big and spacious they were! My mom and I did our hair and make up Friday morning and there was even room for an extra person (even though we had all our make up, hair products, hair straightener, curling iron, and A LOT more! They were located on the 2nd floor in the Casa del Mar location. My aunt and uncle arrived at the hotel around 8pm so I went to check in to their room with them again since it was also under my name. Sherisee (I believe that's how you spell her name) was really helpful! She checked us in quickly and once she saw me taking pictures of my brothers and uncles in front of the lobby by the really nice water fall they have she offered to take the picture for us so that I could be in it too! :) We then went to see their room and it was a lot smaller than our other 2 rooms, this room was only a King room but the furniture was still nice and clean although it had no view. (room 504) The best part was that all 3 of our rooms connected from the inside! Later that night my parents and uncles decided to go to the hotel bar and restaurant and they said the food was really good and at a really decent price! My brothers and I went to the pool and jacuzzi and the water in the pool was so warm and clean! even though it was a really cold night. I really loved this hotel and its really nice location. I just wish I would've stayed there longer since I really wanted to use one of their bikes to go ride along the beach during the day!

I must say that this hotel has one of the friendliest staffs (from phone reservationists to front desk people to restaurant workers, maid service, etc.) that I have ever dealt with. I was very impressed with everyone. The hotel sits on Shelter Island on a strand backing onto a boat marina and across the street from a fishing bay, so there is water on both sides. There are three sections, all styled differently. It looks like they were once three separate motels which have all been combined now. We stayed in the \"Island Palms\" section which had a Polynesian flair and decor. The lobby and restaurant are in this section, so it was convenient for us. The rooms were motel style with openings to the outside. We opted for a non-view room, since we knew we'd be arriving late at night and leaving early in the morning. The view rooms look out over the boat marina--some have little patios on the ground floor. Our room was very small and rather dark, but comfortable. The most impressive part was the bathroom--it was very nicely decorated with good amenities. The bedding was okay--not luxurious, but not scuzzy by any means! My main complaint would be the heating/cooling system. It was noisy and didn't seem to have an automatic thermostat. It was either ON full blast or off. The decor was rather blah at first glance, but grew on me as I noticed many of the themed little touches. With better lighting, it may have impressed me more immediately. We had free internet access, cable tv, coffeemaker, blowdryer and free parking. The area is nice for walking, looking at the boats, watching the fishermen and enjoying the lovely views.

The food was fine, nothing extraordinary, but in a nice setting with views of the marina. There was outdoor seating, also, but it was too cool in the morning to sit out there this time of year.

The Island plams section has been mostly renovated but still leaves a few areas that could use some attention (balconies, painted cupboards int he kitchenette). The kitchenette did not have a dishwasher, something most suites seem to have now. However, the maid was a sweetheart and did any dishes in the sink (or even clean on the counter!) when she came in.

The internet and parking were free, a rarity in San Diego.The best part of BW Island Palms is the location and views. Because it's on a little spit of an island, all sides of the hotel face a waterfront, either the marina or the bay. The Bayside rooms give you a view of San Diego accross the Bay, the Marina rooms overlook the private marina and the Point Loma hills. The hotel offers 2 heated pools and two jacuzzis, both with views of the marina. The hotel has recently built a second section to the hotel known as the Casa del Mar buildings. If you're someone who prefers new when it comes to hotels, be sure to book in the Casa del Mar area. The hotel staff were very pleasant and very helpful. We had some trouble with our rental car our last full day in San Diego.

Tiki torches are lit at night giving it a balmy polynesian flair. The tropical plants and palm trees make you feel like your at some exotic locale. Both pools have a great marina view with the Pt. Loma hills in the distance. Our room was in the newer section of the resort, the Casa Del Mar building, which had a bay view and I enjoyed watching the ships go by from the balcony. We really enjoyed taking walks along the shoreline which has fire-pits, a small sandy beach, also picnic tables and grass. One night we walked over to the Bali Hai restaurant for dinner, which was very good - the views of the San Diego cityscape at night are incredible. Be sure to reserve a table by the window, very romantic. The hotel has free parking, which is nice, plus free bikes to use to run around Shelter Island. The only downside was when we were awakened at 5:45 am by a fire alarm that sent everyone scurrying outside, only to discover it was a false alarm. The fire dept. came and did a sweep, we were all a bit dazed, but glad it was nothing. They didn't know why it went off. The newer building is still in the final finishing process and maybe that could have attributed to a malfunction, who knows. The hotel could have offered something for the shake-up, but didn't. That would have been a masterstroke on their part had they done that, but even that didn't really diminish our stay. At least the fire alarm works well... overall we would go back again, it's a great value for the money and the room was clean, acceptable and quiet and all the staff pleasant.

We stayed in building J, room 223 (an Island Palms suite). As I said earlier, I've reviewed all the comments on this site and I reviewed the Island Palms website. Subsequently, I requested that we be put into a Villa or, in the alternative, the Casa Del Mar suites. Without going into great detail, neither happened despite multiple phone calls and an email exchange. I wasn't thrilled and definitely noted the issues but the room we were placed in was nice enough. That said, we also discovered an ant problem the second day we were there. We had our food on the counter (in the packaging) in the kitchen and there were ants all over the counter. There was a miscommunication with maintenance and it took them approx 2 hours (and 9:15 PM) to show up and spray which I was really unhappy about. I contacted the manager who worked with maintenance to get rid of the ants (which was unsuccessful) but he was very nice and tried his hardest to get rid of the ants. He didn't offer a discount but did call and offer us breakfast, unfortunately, he called after we had already checked out. I think some sort of refund would have been in line but am not going to dwell on it. Our room had a full kitchen but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a stove.

We were on the bay side, and though a small parking lot was outside our door it was still very pleasant to sit on the porch and we had a great view of downtown and the bay.

I encourage you to stay in this one or the Casa Del Mar building, next door with the mini suites. The minute we walked in our building, it smelled new and so clean! The room was large and airy and had a huge flat screen tv, a balcony overlooking the marina, 2 cozy queen beds, a large desk that the tv sat on and housed a small microwave and refrigerator and a separate area with chairs and small table by the balcony. The bathroom was large and had all the modern amenities. The only thing the bathroom lacked (in my opinion) was a fan. We were very impressed with the overall experience.... On the other hand, my first impression of the lobby was kind of small, dark and musty smelling. The shuttle driver that picked us up from the airport, Kyle, was friendly and helpful and knowledgable about the area and had great suggestions. We got picked up from the downtown Amtrak station. When we got to the hotel, since we were there earlier than the normal ck in time of 4p, we were told that our rooms weren't ready yet, so we decided to have lunch in the onsite restaurant, the Blue Wave. It was pretty good for a hotel restaurant. We sat outdoors in the patio area under tables with umbrellas, which helped to suggest an island feel. The windows looking out at the marina could have been a little cleaner (had smudges) but the food was good (my husband and daughter had the blackened Mahi Mahi, I had the fish tacos and my son had the french dip sandwich). After we were done, one of our rooms was ready, so we proceeded to head down. Warning: if you have a lot of luggage, ask them if they could drive you with the little carts, it's quite a walk, especially if you've been hoofing it around Disneyland for 5 days like we just did! We had 2 rooms there, one for our teenagers (which was a godsend!) and ours overlooked the marina. I already described the room above. Overall: Very nice property~relaxing, tiki torches at night, little babbling \"waterfall\" in lobby, nice staff. Right next door is Humphreys on the Bay which also has outdoor concerts. While we were there, Jackson Browne played one night and then America. Good location if you have a car. A little far to walk to restaurants that are \"nearby\" but about 15-20 minutes will get you there. We were only there for 2.5 days, so it was ok for us. We didnt rent a car, but did the Old Town trolley tour one day, and they will pick you up and drop you off right outside the hotel, so it worked out nicely. I highly recommend it. We loved Coronado Island/the Hotel Del/and the beach was excellent! The other times we left we took a cab, it was about $20 one way to downtown (went shopping at Horton Plaza with the teens the first day) and then about the same to get to Seaworld the following day. Not sure if we would stay there again, not hesitating because of any bad experience, just like to try new hotels. I would have liked to use the pools, hot tub, bikes and just relax more at the property, we did the Old Town tour one day and then Seaworld the next and then we left, so If you are going to go, please use and enjoy the property more than we did!

This property is actually the combination of two hotels. Casa del Mar is seemingly the newer hotel of the two. I believe Casa del Mar is mostly the suites. We did not stay in Casa del Mar, we stayed in the Island Palms, adjacent property. I believe both hotels operate under the name of Island Palms Best Western. I would stay here again but in Casa del Mar. The Island Palms facility itself is older, beautiful with its mature trees and shade however our room smelled moldy, there were ants in the room, the beds are quite small and very low. The rooms were tight, a little dark. I believe these comments were comments others have written as well so no real surprises. Having said that it is just a room to sleep in and overall it was clean, I found it acceptable, but just above my cutoff line of what is 'clean' for a hotel. I walked through Casa del Mar just to check it out, it is definitely much cleaner, brighter, larger rooms, seemingly much newer, etc. Oddly enough I believe the prices are comparable which I don't understand since Casa del Mar seemed at least 2 steps above the standard Island Palms rooms. I would recommned you stay in Cas del Mar. The LOCATION of this property is AMAZING. It is incredible with just steps to a small beach on the marina, access to both pools at either hotel, steps to rent a kayak or go fishing, free bike riding. We traveled to San Diego for a wedding, our friends who booked at other hotels more out of town to save money were quite jealous. They paid as much as us or more and didn't get half the hotel and sacrificed location. I would go so far to say that if you are there with your family you could almost never have to get in the car and go anywhere else, something for everyone right there. The rates were incredibly low for such a tremendous location, what a steal! Parking is completely FREE, did I mention FREE? Internet is completely FREE (now that is definitely not found often). There is an on-site washer/dryer you can use for a nominal cost of like $1.00 per load, fabulous if you there with family like we were. Bikes are complimentary at the hotel. Kayking just across the street is something like $20 per 2 hours, another great steal. The two pools are great, the Island Palms with more ambience and an outdoor bar, Casa del mar more modern with a nice fireplace outdoors. Next time I would definitely rent a junior suite in Casa Del Mar, I think definitely worth the additional costs and there really simply is no better location. I peaked in on a suite in the Casa Del Mar and it looked fabulous. Most anything on the Marina side has an incredible view, make sure you book a room on the Marina side no matter which hotel you are at. Every room on the marina side of Casa Del Mar had a private little patio. The Island Palms rooms only the large rooms had patios, ours just a chair with a little lawn, still very nice to just step right outside and view the beautiful marina and the boats, the water, etc. The hotel is secluded making you feel like you are on an island yet it is just minutes and I mean minutes to just about everything you want to see in San Diego. I checked out the other hotels while I was there that I had looked at online before my travels, they just don't compare, much more commercialized areas with tons of people and traffic. Island Palms is difficult to explain and the photos don't do it justice, but the VIEWS are just INCREDIBLE. Humphrey's, adjacent to the Best Western, looks nice to stay at also. I believe all are owned by the same developer who appears to be snatching up all the properties on Shelter Island. Humphreys has outdoor concerns which you could hear lightly down the street, if you're younger you might enjoy staying there and listening to the concerts. Insider Tip: A local told us about SUNSET CLIFFS ... DEFINITELY worth the trip. Sunset Cliffs is an incredible view of the ocean, the views watching the sunset are breathtaking, again, words don't do it justice. Sunset Cliffs is also great just to look at the beautiful homes, have a picnic, walks some trails (its a public park). We watched locals propel themselves down the cliffs to the small private beach and surf in, while the sun sets, really incredible. We definitely hope to go back and will definitely stay on Shelter Island.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGood family hotel\u201d", "Author": "BigTTTTT", "ReviewID": "UR37023141", "Content": "Stayed in a queen suite- like a small apartment, very convenient and pretty good value for this area.

We reserved a junior suite and stayed in the Casa Del Mar Building in room 506 with 2 queen beds. The room was clean and exactly as described on the website. It was extremely spacious with a pretty big (long) balcony. Our balcony directly faced a new Island Palms building being remodeled but off to the left was a great view of the bay and to the right a small view of the boats. I wish it was more clear on their website that the wet bar includes plates, bowls, forks, spoons, cups, etc so that I could have brought oatmeal, cereal, etc for our 2 year old daughter but I'm mentioning it now so that it might help someone else. This room also has a small refrigerator and a complimentary in-room safe. The Casa Del Mar building is situated right across the street from a pier where many people fish (so don't forget your fishing poles if you want to take a stab at catching a mackerel or two!) and right across from a children's playground which we spent quite a few hours at. The hotel is about a 7 minute drive to Sea World up Nimitz Street. Because of the close proximity, we were able to bring our daughter back to the hotel for a nap during our all-day visit to Sea World. Super convenient and great location! The Casa Del Mar pool is currently closed for renovations. The main pool and jacuzzi off the lobby was open and was super busy with allot of children. It was fine for us since our 2 year old loved all of the other children but if you are looking for a quiet, romantic pool - this is probably not the place for you or at least it was not the place on Memorial Day weekend. Overall our stay was great. There was one thing that bothered me - the walls were thin thus the 4 star overall and room rating (=very good, not excellent). One of our neighbors was so loud - they had the TV blasting at night, I could hear their conversations, etc. Luckily my daughter and husband slept right thru it! I think this was an isolated incident because I never heard a peep from the neighbor on the other side of us or anyone else in this building. But beware that the walls in the Casa Del Mar building are thin and if you get unlucky enough to have inconsiderate people next to you, you will hear them. Also, FYI the parking is not great. They have limited spaces available on the property and if you get back late you might not find a space and have to park across the street at the park, which the hotel said is okay - a little inconvenient but not a big deal.

It's often said that San Diego hasn't realized it's a small town that grew into a big city. Staying at this hotel evokes a feeling of San Diego as it used to be. Located on Shelter Island, the hotel is isolated from the rampant development, freeways and mall jams that characterize the more high-profile neighborhoods. Yet it is convenient to all that. But on Shelter Island you're surrounded by shops, restaurants and homes that don't seem to have changed much in the past 20 or 30 years. You're in the middle of the \"yachtie\" subculture, a different little world. The pace is slower and the view is superb. It's worth the extra price to get a \"Bayview Suite\" on the 2nd floor facing the harbor (not the marina). Bring binoculars and amuse yourself from your deck, living room or bed with an unobstructed view of the fascinating boat traffic in the channel. You'll see everything from massive U.S. Navy vessels and cruise ships to tourist \"duck\" boats and fishing boats plus pleasure boats arriving in the U.S. from Mexico. A lovely green park runs alongside the channel -- perfect place for a picnic or a brisk morning walk. Or go to the other side of the hotel, with rows and rows of yachts in the marina, to watch boat crews busily taking care of the rich people's playthings. The suite is comfortable, with ceiling fans, vaulted bedroom ceiling and a kitchen that makes it feel more like home. The rooms were redecorated enough years ago t be a bit dated now.

We spent the entire week at the Island Palms - great choice (thanks to TripAdvisor reviews!). We booked a bay view room (I know everyone recommends the marina view, but it was just a boring view of moored boats & a hill covered with homes - probably a little quieter). Our room was in the Casa del Mar building on the second floor. We had a private balcony with views of the harbor - cruise ships, fishing boats, navy ships (say a destroyer pass by just about every day), a fishing pier. You heard regular noise from Navy helicopters and jets taking off, but it was not overwhelming at all. If you are on the lower level of the Casa del Mar, you will get a lovely view of the parking lot, but the water is just across the street. The room was very clean and comfortable - couldn't ask for more. A functioning air conditioner and ceiling fan, plus plenty of toiletries and towels. The sink was separate from the toilet & tub/shower which was nice. There was a coffee maker and refrigerator, a desk with internet hookup, and a very comfortable chair along with our king sized bed. We always found the room clean and refreshed upon returning every evening. The windows also cranked open (after shifting the chairs around that were on the patio). I found this to be a very quiet, secluded hotel. You seemed to be away from it all on Shelter Island, but were within a 10-15 minute drive to everything (Zoo, Sea World, Balboa Park, Embarcadero, Mission Beach, La Jolla, Gaslamp area) - even supermarkets, drug stores, gas stations and Target were within 15 minutes driving. Staff was all super friendly. Pool & hot tub were wonderful and quiet (we used the second smaller pool and hot tub behind the Casa del Mar building). Later in the day, there weren't any towels at the pool, so bring your own from your room. There was a computer near the hotel's restaurant for internet use, so we were able to print our boarding passes before leaving. Exercise room was small but adequate (we didn't use it - just stuck our heads in). Hotel restaurat was decent, but we found much better food within walking distance. Across from the hotel is a waterfront park with a boat launch, public fishing pier, playground, and walkway. It was very nice to stroll along the water each night, and I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. We had a small incident late in the week where the boiler in our building went down. We were lucky that we had gotten up early enough to get a lukewarm shower. We immediately contacted the front desk, and before we had left for the morning, a gentleman stopped by our room to let us know about the boiler and that they were working on it (we actually saw the workers arrive as we left the room - quick service!). I can't wait to get back to San Diego to stay here again. Our only complaint for the entire week - the parking is tight near the Casa Del Mar building on the weekends (Friday & Saturday night).

They were very helpful and even gave us good advice over a room - ie the bay view rooms do indeed look towards the bay, but between the room and the water is the hotel car park and a road and then a public car park before you see water! As a result, we took their recommendation (at a slightly higher rate admittedly) of a marina view room. This was perfect. We were in the two-storey (no lift) building at the far end of the hotel - I think it had recently been acquired and was originally another small hotel; the room was excellent and had clearly been renovated recently. The decor, carpets, bedding etc were high quality and immaculate. We had a huge king bed in a large room with a balcony (with chairs) that looked directly over the pool and the marina. There are two pools here - the main pool is very prettily landscaped with a hot -tub, toilets etc and right next to the bar/restaurant, but as a result was busier. We had the luxury, by opting for the smaller pool and hot tub outside our room, of having it to ourselves nearly every time we went there! The staff were amazing, from greeting us by name the minute we arrived to doing all they could for us. THe standard of housekeeping was top class.

The problem with the bay view is that we faced the hotel parking lot, 2-lane street, and public parking across the street. The same large motor homes blocked our view for days. My suggestion is to choose the view facing the marina--much quieter and prettier! Unfortunately, we had noisy neighbors. I had to call the front desk 3 nights for 3 different guests. One guest left his loud TV on; security had to shut the power to his room as he apparently was not in the room. Other guests were very noisy outside and inside (returning from partying late at night?). Security was always fairly quick to respond. The hotel staff was wonderful. They were helpful, courteous and friendly. Upon check-out they gave us a generous voucher for lunch to make up for the neighboring guests' loudness. Our room was clean, pleasantly appointed, and the beds/pillows were so comfortable! It was small for 4 people (2 adults and 2 teen daughters). The large size of the bathroom made up for it, however. Granite countertops, tile floors, stone lined shower--very, very nice! The pool and hot tub were very clean. Usually I won't go into a public hot tub, but we enjoyed it every evening.

We had a terrific stay. We had a junior suite, with two queen beds, in the newer Casa del Mar building on the second floor that provided a wonderful view of the marina. (My wife and I spent many early morning and late evening hours sitting on the balcony, enjoying the view.) The junior suite provided lots of space. The Island Palms has two swimming pools, with the larger and nicer pool connected to the main building; that pool also had a tiki bar with reasonably-priced drinks and good service. We ate a good and reasonably-priced breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. We also enjoyed the Shelter Island location; it provided a quiet respite from busier San Diego, but was easy driving distance to the Zoo and other attractions. A few notes: (1) the Casa del Mar building (a former hotel that was acquired by the Island Palms some years ago) looked newer and nicer than the other Island Palms building. I suspect that TA reviews that complained about small or older looking accommodations were not staying in the Casa del Mar. The junior suite in the Casa del Mar was pleasantly large; (2) inquire with the hotel if you care whether your room has a view of the bay or the marina. Island Palms' description of the rooms' views can be confusing (if not misleading). A busy public parking lot and a public street separate the hotel from the bay itself. If you want to view the bay, you must have a second floor room, which would enable you to see over the parking lot and road. These second floor rooms are called \"water view\" rooms. The first floor rooms facing the bay are called \"bay view\" rooms -- despite the fact that they will provide nothing more than view of the car parked in front of your room. Adding to the confusion is that \"water view\" rooms (in addition to describing second floor rooms facing the bay) also describe rooms facing the marina. I did not learn this terminology until shortly before we were scheduled to leave on our trip. We originally had a \"bay view\" room. After several conversations with the hotel, we managed to change our reservation to a marina view room -- which required a reservation for a \"water view\" room \"facing the marina\" (and not the bay). ( Hope that wasn't too confusing.) I don't think we would have enjoyed our stay nearly as much if we had a first floor view of the \"bay.\" The marina view was tremendous.

I think they must have different sized rooms because some of the reviews talk about how spacious the rooms are, with beautiful views. I was told we had a view over the phone, but in reality our view was partial. The reason we chose this hotel over the Howard Johnson or Days Inn was because the reviews on trip advisor of those hotels were that they were in a terrible, unsafe neighborhood, only to find out they were within a mile of this hotel. The Best Western is in a more secluded, beautiful area but we are from Los Angeles, so to us, those other hotels were not in as sketchy of a neighborhood as was described.

Checking in was a breeze. Very friendly and attentive front desk staff. But be forewarned, this is a fairly big, sprawling complex. My room was waaaay down towards the end of the compound. At first, I wasn't pleased with the prospect of hiking back and forth to the main building with a laden down briefcase for my meetings, but then I found that my meetings were going to be held in the same building as my sleeping room. They had us preorder lunch every morning, and then served it in the same building as the meeting room. What convenience! The sleeping rooms were fairly standard, except that most had patios or balconies (hence making it convenient to watch the ships). Clean and well appointed with mini-fridges. Free wi-fi internet in the sleeping and meeting rooms. The restaurant in the main building is lovely, and the food is quite good. The exercise room is a little small, but if only one or two people are using it, it's not that claustrophobic. More than two people at a time would be a nightmare. The hotel offers a free airport shuttle. In addition, schedule permitting, the driver will take you to local restaurants and stores. You can then call for pick-up. I wish I had a rental car though, since during my stay it was very chilly, windy and rainy... waiting in the cold for the driver was not pleasant (although the driver WAS pleasant).

I've stayed at most of the hotels on Shelter Island and this one is better than average. I've stayed twice recently. Once in the Casa Del Mar building and once in one of the tropical themed little huts that jut out from the other buildings. I preferred the layout of the rooms in the Casa del Mar building because they were quiet (better insulation) and also more spacious than the other \"tropical\" themed building. Overall the rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly and accomodating (both times). The room service was reasonably priced (not a complete rip off like most hotels) and was a good value with tasty food (good waffles!). Drawbacks were that the room in the Casa del Mar building needed work in the bathroom (needing grouting to be redone and the wallpaper had started to peel). The \"tropical\" themed other building (hut) was great (had a nice little porch area that was relaxing to enjoy the breeze). BUT it was very noisy (almost no insulation between the room and the next room). It was also more cramped than the other room, as they made the bathroom too large (weird layout) yet without a bath tub! But other than that I would rate this hotel fairly well. I would give it a B+ for the Shelter Island area. Would recommend for tourists and locals alike. Would not recommend for noisy families with kids or for partiers.

We booked a water view junior suite in the Casa Del Mar building, but the hotel \"upgraded\" us to a full suite on the water since they apparently gave our room to someone else. The suite idea was nice, the location was great, but the suite was terribly old, brown (yes brown! - everything in it was brown) and dark. The curtains were those old filmy kind which were half off the rods, and covered by dark brown drapes which were also half off the rods. The cabinet in the bedroom which held the TV had to be from the 50's when this hotel was 1st built, with large chips of wood missing. There was only one lamp with a single 100 watt bulb in the whole bedroom area. We paid $243 per nite, plus San Diego City 10% tax for this room, which I think was way too much considering the condition of the room. This suite actually rents for $299 a nite, but since they \"upgraded\" us from the $258 Jr. Suite rate, they gave it to us for the above (which also included the 10% AAA discount). I wouldn't be complaining if we got it for 50% off rack rate as one of the reviewers paid, but for the amount we were charged it was way overpriced.

My husband (31) and I (30), stayed here for 5 nights near the end our 3 week trip down the Californian coast. We wanted somewhere to chill out and do absolutely nothing after a very busy tour. It was our relaxing part of the trip. All we wanted was somewhere clean with a bar/restaurant, a pool and in an area where it was pleasant to go for a stroll. I booked an Island Palms Marina view King direct with the hotel a few months beforehand and paid $161 a night before tax. I had e-mailed the hotel a few times with various questions and queries and they always responded quickly. The only thing we had planned was a day at SeaWorld (which we loved, I'd recommend the 'Behind the Scenes' tour - I think we paid about $11 each online, definitely worth it!) When we arrived at the airport I called the hotel for the FREE shuttle which arrived in about 10 minutes, very prompt. The shuttle was one of the big positives of the hotel. The 2 drivers went out of their way to give recommendations, advice and help. Nothing was too much for them! They gave us a card and told us to call anytime if we needed taking anywhere or picking up from anywhere. We took them up on this on 2 occassions and they took us to SeaWorld and picked us up from Old Town on the 2 days we ventured out. I must admit that I was a bit dissapointed in the room initially. It didn't look like the website pictures and was quite dated and shabby with a very old, stained carpet. However, it was clean and comfortable. We had a flickering light and phoned reception who sent someone to fix it straight away. We were in the Sunset Garden area which was used for 2 weddings during our stay. It didn't inconvienience us at all, but we were given vouchers for a complimentary drink at the bar and offered a later checkout time as one wedding was on the day of our departure. There is a resident flock of ducks which waddle around the gardens. Very cute, but not when they're quacking at 7a.m. - bring earplugs! I have read other reviews where people have complained about the standard of housekeeping. We had no problems on that front but did notice several room service trays left outside rooms for up to 24 hours without being cleared away. I also had a wierd experience when a non-english speaking housekeeping woman knocked on the door, gave me a very odd freaky smile and walked away. We ate at the restaurant one night and the bar 2 nights. No complaints there. Yes, the restaurant service was a bit slow by American standards, but OK by British standards! The staff were all very friendly and we had a few jolly nights in the bar! On the recommendation of one of the shuttle drivers we booked a table at the Hawaiian themed Bali Hai restaurant at the other end of the island. It was about a 10/15 minute walk. If you can, make your booking to co-incide with sunset. It's spectacular to see the the tall glass buildings across the bay sparkle in the red sunlight. It's not cheap, but the service was very good, the food was lovely, and definitely try out the cocktails! They're fab! This was one of my favourite nights. We also ate at the Fiddlers Green restaurant about a 20minute walk away. My husband said his steak was the best he'd ever had. High praise indeed! The days we weren't at SeaWorld or wondering around Old Town (who needs to go to Mexico -it's here!) and Downtown, we lazed by the pool. There are 2 pools and the one by the reception and bar area was always busy. The smaller pool in the Casa Del Mar area was much quieter, in fact, most of the time we had the pool area and whirlpool to ourselves. There were supposed to be towels provided, but on 2 occassions I had to go to the other pool to get them as there were none. So, in conclusion .... Good points: free shuttle, helpful staff, great bar, free internet access, 2 pools, lovely views, peaceful location.

We stayed in the Island Palms section in a villa and I agree with previous reviews which say that website pictures are very misleading. That's if you can get it to stop crashing and have to restart your computer every time. The \"villa's\" are only the equivalent of 4 small motel rooms joined top to bottom by a grotty and slippy spiral staircase. The villa's are right next to the hotel's ballroom which hosts their many weddings and the noise would be a problem if you had small kids or needed to sleep. I rang and asked Reception at what point the disco was finishing and was told that it was virtually over - it went on for another two hours!! The block is basically a sixties motel given a superficial tart up. The windows are still the same grotty metal frames and are impossible to open. The a/c is old fashioned individual units and noisy. The rooms are dark and furnished in a dirty dreary green colour presumably to hide the stains which are over everything, carpets and furnishings included. The main problem however is that EVERYTHING is dirty or broken. The door into our room was filthy and it went on from there. Stained, scuffed, broken or uncared for was the order of the day. The \"full kitchen\" promised was underequipped, scruffy and smelt permanently of sour milk. NOTHING worked properly from the lights to the tv's and the room was not cleaned well every day we were there, even the bedcushions had unsavoury looking stains. Yuck. Dog poop in the corridor was also a nice touch one day! (upstairs!) Well I think it was dog's.... People let their dogs mess on the grass outside your rooms as well. It is not very private when sitting outside due to the constant foot traffic and the odd strange kid on noisy, petrol driven scooters. There seems to be no restriction on who can walk through the hotel's pathways and gawp at you in the pool. We did not swim as we felt the rooms were so filthy we were likely to catch something in the pool. Security is also a huge problem, we were woken at 3.30 am by someone banging on every door. This was a worry as my teenage daughter was sleeping on her own downstairs. the doors are left permanently propped open and there is no staff in this building overnight nor any security that I saw.

Overall, it was wonderful and we would stay there again without a doubt!", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, TN", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful and Scenic\u201d", "Author": "DollarsMom", "ReviewID": "UR5358550", "Content": "After reading reviews about how noisy the hotels are at Pacific Beach, we looked for something that promised to be more quiet and peaceful. Thanks to the help of the positive reviews this hotel received, we found exactly what we were looking for at the Island Palms. The views of the harbor were lovely, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the staff could not have been nicer. The location was also very convenient to everything in town and we were able to park right next to our room.

We got the guet room and it is very small. The positive about this hotel is the area. It is right at the bay where you can casually strole with the family or a significant other. The other positive is customer service. It is obvious that customer service is a big priority. Very curteous and prompt. The negative is that the place itself can use some remodeling. My already small room was scratched up in some places and there was areas outside where trash and fleas were abundant. The restaurant was slightly above average but could used more variety. What makes this hotel worth the stay is the area and customer service.

The wooden louvered windows give a nice view from inside the room, and it allows a lot of light inside - really brightens the room. The bathroom is super spacious. The staff is awesome.

Nice suprise perfect for sodas from Vons just up the street!! The hotel was very clean and quiet. Except for the family of ducks and ducklings didn't hear anything. The staff was great and friendly!!

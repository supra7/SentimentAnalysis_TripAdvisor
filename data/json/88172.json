I had read some reviews that said the hotel was older and it was obvious - worn carpet and such - but they must have recently replaced the carpet because it looked and smelled new. The bathroom was clean and nicely stocked with delicious-smelling soap and shampoo and plenty of towels. We were on the 4th floor and there were no loud parties or kids running around or noisy events going on such as a wedding reception. I was able to hear noise in the hall when a few people walked by talking, but it was not distracting. The only things I didn't care for or wasn't impressed by were the absence of an exhaust fan in the bathroom, which made getting ready after taking a shower like trying to get ready in a sauna HOT AND STEAMY. The coffee in the room claimed to be \"Italy's Favorite\"...if that's the case, Italians know nothing about coffee...it was really terrible!

For full disclosure, I've been a Hilton Diamond member for over 15 years and can speak unequivocally about them. The upgrade I requested at check-in was honored by providing me with free internet access and an oversized King suite on the 3rd floor (room 336). Everything was in order; no calls to housekeeping for towels, toiletries, or an unkept room. While it looks like it hadn't been remodeled in 5 to 10 years, there was evidence of age due to wore out carpet or furniture. In general, it was quite comfortable. Next came room service and Cassie, who brought up the Reuben sandwich and salad in just under 5 minutes! She was friendly and professional, consistent with Mark at the front desk. I'd requested a room upgrade in a quiet location since I needed to get up early. I enjoyed a perfect night's sleep, as I heard no adjacent noises or hallway shenanigans. As to location, I was able to go to a Fedex Kinkos and a Chase bank within 1 miles or less of the hotel, and my business meeting was at the Castleton Mall which was about 2 miles away.

We parked our car in the back, but we'd have to walk all the way around to the front, or enter through the back entrance where the meeting rooms were. Either way, it'd be a lot of walking just to get back to our rooms from the back parking lot. On the second day of our stay, someone(maybe a manager?) called up and asked how the stay is going so far...I mentioned the breakfast voucher mishap, and he said he'd take care of it. When I went downstairs he had vouchers waiting for me. That was very nice, but I really should have gotten them in the first place. The breakfast was good.

This trip being last minute found me searching nearby as all Hilton Family properties were booked up in Carmel. Just 6 miles from Carmel, I found this Hilton. I only briefly looked at the past reviews as I had confidence in the Hilton name. I am a HH Diamond member so received my choice of perks upon the very simple and quick check in. The hotel is easy to get in and out of from the I-69 and I-465 freeway system. The room is nicely set up and roomy enough. At first I felt the buibs in the bathroom were way too dim but they were the \"slow warming\" type which is nice in the morning when you need to adjust to the light. The walls were thinner than any other Hilton I have been in. Door slams and some activity (alarm clock) next door could be heard. I am a heavy sleeper so it had little impact on me. I can say that the plush Serenity Bed more than makes up for any other items lacking at this property! Most of my stays in Carmel are at a Hampton Inn and while the Hampton bed is good, the Hilton bed is SO MUCH better! OTHER NOTABLES: The water pressure was VERY GOOD which is something that I really enjoy! There is a small pool and exercise area which looked quite nice. Parking is easy and seemed to be plentiful enough for the property. I ate the breakfast as my free perk for being Diamond.

My husband and I stayed for a nice, weekend getaway. We booked through Priceline, so I really didn't have a choice for the hotel, but the price we paid was very good. We requested a king room, which they were able to accommodate even though the hotel was completely booked for all kinds of sporting events. There was a college basketball team there, as well as, what seemed to be HUNDREDS of kids for some kind of soccer tournament. Anyway, our room was very satisfactory. It was spacious, clean, and everything seemed to be in working order. No complaints. Then we heard teenagers goofing off in the hall. I thought they'd move on, but they didn't. Pretty soon, I heard music playing outside my door, so I opened the door and went out. There were three teenaged girls just sitting around on the floor outside my room. One licking a sucker, one playing a radio and the other just standing there. I didn't say a word, I just looked at them like, \"Why are you guys sitting outside my door?\" One of the girls obviously read minds, so she offered, \"We're just sitting here waiting for someone in 'that' room.\" She pointed to the door next door to mine. I just walked back into my room without saying a word, but thankfully, they got the point and moved along. All weekend, there were kids running up and down the hallways. I don't blame the kids or the hotel...this is just irresponsible parenting (there were parents everywhere, too). Anyway, my room was nice enough, other than the obvious, and even with the noise, I was still okay with the hotel...until it was time to go to bed. The bed feels soft and squishy, which at first feels okay, but me AND my husband woke up stiff and achy in the middle of the night! Also, the A.C. doesn't cool well enough. There is scientific PROOF that the ideal sleeping temperature for the human body is 64 degrees F. I can't stand it when hotel A/C units don't function well. If you are the type of person who likes it COLD when you sleep (like me), get ready to sweat. Plus, the bedding was VERY warm, so the room really needed to be much cooler for comfort. My husband doesn't like it as cold as I do, but even he was hot. He completely took the covers off himself. So between the soft mattress, warm down bedding, and the warm room, we were pretty miserable at night. Which is too bad because this could be a great hotel. They need new mattresses and cooler bedding and/or better A/C units. They have a restaurant downstairs that is pretty decent. An indoor pool. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is near two Indianapolis shopping malls, and dozens of restaurants. It's also about 30 minutes from a casino off I-69, if you like to gamble. Parking is also FREE which is a huge plus! If I got this place for a great price (like I did), I'd probably be okay with it again, but I would not pay rack rate for this place. No way.

If we could have changed out minds at this point we would have but we had gone online and didn't have a refund option. We arrived late and were met at the locked doors after about 10 minutes of waiting. We were so exhausted that we didn't really look at the room we just fell asleep. We didn't sleep well because the bedding was cheap and rough and the bed- spread was made out of some plastic like material that was very loud. In the morning we found that the furniture was broken, the sway to the beds left us all with a back ache. The quality of everything was worse than any budget motel I have ever stayed at! There was new carpeting through out the hotel but that was all that was new. The room was full of disrepair and out of date items.

She immediately had us moved to a nicer room. The front desk was VERY unhappy about the switch of rooms and his every action said so. The staff overall was flip, condescending and acted like they were above meeting the needs of the guests. The new room was in better repair but the quality problem didn't go away! The toilet paper reminded me of our trip to Russia. It was just above brown paper towels. There was a huge problem with cleanliness. The first room suffered from long periods of hit an miss cleaning while the second room with it's newer tiles was just getting started with nice fresh problems. There was hair in the bathtub from the previous occupants. The tub itself was cheap and still had old fixtures that should have been replaced in the remodeling. The windows were filthy. There was broken glass after the room had been cleaned and they just left the smaller pieces in the door way of the bathroom.

The outside and the lobby were very deceptive of the rooms quality and service and I would have left if I could have gotten my money back and most certainly would have left anyway if our stay was not so short. I did become ill and needed to find medical attention. The staff was not very helpful but finally very rudely said that we should try an emergency medical center right behind the hotel. Everything was so bad that our teenaged son who is normally and just due to age clueless to anything like cleanliness of a hotel room (just point him to the pool) asked as we rode down the elevator to find the med center if we had to stay in this place? While we were out a friend called but they would not take a message and there was no answering system. They said they wouldn't get anything done if they took messages for guests. I told them it didn't look like it was helping much.", "Date": "June 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNot Nearly Meeting the Standard\u201d", "Author": "TravelerKD", "ReviewID": "UR2081925", "Content": "What made the situation more acceptable was getting a low conference rate. But attention to details is lacking. The hotel's climate is erratic. The lobby is exasperatingly hot, while some conference rooms are chilly. There were mysterious problems with our reservations, which had to be ironed out at the front desk with undue frustration. Expect to pay unreasonable parking fees if you stay here. The standard room rate is an absolute ripoff. If you get a very low rate (i.e. conference rate of $87.00) it may be okay, but not a good deal.", "Date": "May 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cNot in sync with other Omni Hotels\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1727378", "Content": "We are Select Guest with the Omni, and we stay at Omni's all over the country. This Omni was like a discount Omni. The rooms were big, but they did not offer most of the amenities the other hotels do... nor were they polite when asked. In fact, the woman at the front desk was as rude as she could be, and there were staff sleeping in the lobby when we came in at midnight! We put our drink order on the door for the next morning...and it never came. They called us 1 hour early for our wake up call. The maid claims we had a Do Not Disturb on our door - and that is why our room was not cleaned one day - yet we NEVER use the Do Not Disturb sign. The hotel is clean and the rooms are large, but that is the only good thing I can say about this Omni.

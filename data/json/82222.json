The evening wine tastings in the lobby were a nice touch and we also liked the grill restaurant, although a completely different atmosphere - mostly just hotel guests, the food was great and always there is someone on hand to recommend wine pairings. when we went into st helena, they took us in the complimentary limo which was great (although I am not sure if this is always available) The hiking trail on the property is quite extensive, we needed walking boots after the rain.

You have two choices: (1) abstain: put your car keys in the room safe and forget the combination; or (2) lengthen your stay by at least 2 days and suffer the financial consequences: spend 2 days in tasting rooms or wineries and 2 days at the resort.

A few highlights stand out. We had dinner in the Restaurant -- very inventive cuisine, extraordinary service. We booked a private wine excursion with the sommelier, Gilles de Chambure, and got a real insider's view of three wineries (including two fabulous small places that we never would have gone to on our own). And, believe it or not, the croquet lession was fabulous, something I'd never get anyplace else. Two things set this place apart from the rest. First, serenity -- everything about this property is calming. We did a lot during our stay and yet I left more relaxed than I have from any vacation. It felt like a private club, set out just for us. And the biggest asset of this resort is the service. Every single staff member (and there are a lot of them) seemed dedicated to doing whatever we wanted at a given moment. I'd give particular recognition to our concierge Bob, who set up all sorts of cool activities and visits for us.

We were taken to our table which had beautiful views of the hill tops which surround Meadowood and the golf course. Dinner was inexplicable. It was just 9 courses of incredible food and wine. The wait staff felt like old friends; so friendly and personable. It was a beautiful meal that I won't forget. The next morning, we ordered a hearty breakfast (which we enjoyed on the patio) before we went on a hike of the grounds. The hiking trails were very nice. They were moderate to difficult at the top without being technical. There was a group of turkeys that crossed our path and went on their way. Meadowood's hiking trails have benches (some, stocked with water) along the way to take a breather and enjoy the views. It was a lovely way to start the day. I had an afternoon massage at the Spa.

It's not an overly extravagant spa, but it has all the amenities one would expect; a steam room and sauna, showers, lockers, etc. Really, just what you need to feel comforted before a massage.

We've stayed at the Harvest Inn before and they have fireplaces in each room and the feeling is great. The amenities in the room were fine, towels, linens, wide screen TV but no ambiance. Cold feeling. We ate only in the 3 meal restaurant food was good, service was good no complaints there and everyone was very nice. It's a little unnerving to drive through in the pitch dark to your unattached cabin style rooms and ours was a little treacherous to walk to which was down from the parking area about 5 flights of timber steps and lose gravel. Another 10 years in me and I wouldn't do that again. I just feel for the $700 plus room rate you should get more out of the room irrespective that they have pools, tennis, etc. Those are available at great hotels everywhere. Like I said they need to renovate (as in tear out) all the old stuff and get a decorator that understandszz cozy.

Our Treeline room was on the older side, but very well-kept. The bed was comfortable, and the room had a nice fireplace and seating area and a small patio for dining. While the bathroom needed refreshening (small tile floors, wainscoting, and some outdated lighting fixtures), the look overall was clean and classic. (A remodeled Treeline cottage was available, but at a higher cost.) I didn't want to spa, so my wife ended up getting two treatments. Late the second day while my wife was at the spa, I walked on to the golf course -- and had the entire course to myself. I played the entire 9 in just over an hour, and then replayed the first two holes again just for the fun of it. The Restaurant at Meadowood was fantastic. The food was (surpisingly) right up there with the French Laundry. Other notes: Service was excellent overall. E.g., we ordered breakfast from the golf course one day, and it was delivered to our room just as we finished our round. The wine director (and Master Sommelier), Gilles, gave us two excellent winery recommendations -- Viader and Gargiulo. The free handout map of Napa wineries is the best that I've ever seen.

The gym and spa is a haven for a vigorous exercise routine followed by a hot rock massage and quiet reflection in the eucalyptus-scented sauna. We loved our room. It had a casual but elegant feel, the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on and the linens were as nice as the ones I bring back from Italy.

On purpose. Call it an \"individual retreat\" if you like but the truth is I was looking to escape the harsh reality of a sad breakup and what better way to do it than to head to wine country. After an exhaustive review of the Meadowood website I narrowed my pick down to two flavors of room and a quick call to a very helpful young man in reservations had me reserved into an Oakview Lodge. This collection of \"cottages\" are up on the hillside nestled in amongst the trees and if you're looking for privacy - this is the ticket. I live in the Bay Area so it was easy for me to come fully stocked with a small cooler etc., and this worked out so well I literally didn't leave the room for two days, with the exception of a grocery run to Sunshine Foods and a drive down Silverado Trail to worship at the house of Rombauer. I did not eat at the famous restaurant. Rely on the other folks here - I've no doubt the food's wonderful. I did not swim in the pool. But it sounded like everyone else in the resort did. I did not partake of the spa. I did not play croquet or golf. What did I do you ask? I slept beneath the eaves of a cottage in a king bed that was as soft as a cloud, surrounded by no less than seven pillows and in linens so luxurious now I am going to have to reoutfit my bed at home. I bought a hot, pre-prepared meal at Sunshine Foods that was so good I am seriously contemplating making the drive to St. Helena to buy another one. Now this may sound low end, but remember I went here to *escape* and the thought of sitting in a restaurant by myself with an open bottle of Rombauer and a straw I didn't feel was befitting the elegance of this resort. So I ate in my cottage. It was the best weekend I've had in years. I wondered around in the gigantic white tile and glass blocked shower bathroom with the beautiful skylight and looked up at the trees. One night I lit candles and took a bath in the soaking tub. I sunbathed on my private deck one afternoon. When it got too hot, I retreated to the air conditioning of the cottage. I read all six magazines in the room. I only mistakenly placed the Travel & Leisure in my suitcase because it was the \"Best of\" issue.....uhhhhh yes, in which Meadowood made the list. My one gripe is the room did not have a DVD player which put season 2 of \"Entourage\" back in the case, but I didn't mind. I did visit the pool in the early evening where I was the only one there. It was heaven. In closing, Meadowood - in addition to being quite nice for the honeymooners and romantic-getawayers, turned out to be *perfect* for a solo getawayer. For anyone looking to escape the world and a large part of their disposable income - go. I will be returning.

We had originally planned to stay for 2 nights and extended our visit for another...we just didn't want to leave :) Having been gone for only 3 days, we have come back relaxed as though we had been on vacation for a week. This Napa Valley jewel is part of the Relais & Chateaux collection and I would highly recommend it.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay -- if you can afford it.\u201d", "Author": "brendonla", "ReviewID": "UR8065675", "Content": "DISCLAIMER: I stayed here 2 nights for free because my wife was working for one of the sponsors of the Napa Valley Wine Auction. We did pay for our food, but the lodging was free (well, she was working the event, so she earned it in my eyes.) That being said, this is a really nice property. Secluded. Quiet. Upscale goes without saying given the price tag. But not pretentious -- I have a low tolerance for going places where people are there to be seen: this is not one of those places (but when you tell locals you're staying here, they always say, \"oh how nice!\" as they raise their eyebrows). To get the most out of this place, you really need to stay probably 4-5 nights and use the pool, spa, tennis courts etc. We didn't have a chance to do any of that since we had a full schedule with the Wine Auction and attendant gatherings (dinners, lunches at local wineries and restaurants). Staff was very friendly and helpful. NEVER got any attitude from anyone on the property. Room itself was very nice -- like having our own little bungalow. Having said that, do I think it's worth $800+ a night? Eh, I dunno about that. But it was spacious, had a GREAT bed (seriously, the most comfortable bed I have EVER slept in a on vacation - I was tempted to ask what brand bed it was!), nice bathroom amenities, and a nice little patio overlooking the golf course. Yeah, the TV is small...but who comes to Napa to watch TV in their room? If you do, I pity you. The in-room breakfast brought to us was good, but frankly I've had a similar breakfast at the San Francisco Marriott that was just as good at half the price. Staff was great though: they forgot my orange juice and brought us 2, one on the house. Nice. Only gripe: we left our room the second day in the morning. When we got back at 3:30 p.m. to take a break and freshen up before dinner, the staff was still cleaning our room, so we had to wait in the lobby/lounge area for about 45 minutes until they were done. This kinda thing shouldn't happen on a property like this. Like another reviewer said: if you have cash to burn, by all means, stay here. If you're like my wife and myself and prefer to throw down $$ on food and going out and seeing the sights instead of where you hang your head, you can probably find just as good a room for much less in Napa.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, great staff, quiet winter getaway\u201d", "Author": "alcw", "ReviewID": "UR7772773", "Content": "This is a great place for a couple to get away from it all.

The property is huge, and lovely, with acres of trees and the golf course. It seems to extend over a mile or so, and a golf cart takes you to your individual cottage in the woods. My room was exqusite, with a private entrance, lots of windows, sisal matt rugs, a writing desk, flat screen tv, fireplace, and seating area with a soft throw blanket to drape over my legs as I relaxed and took in the beauty of the place. There was an incredibly comfortable King-sized bed with lots of pouffy sleeping pillows and halogen reading lights... A large box of complimentary chocolates awaited me, and I have to admit I tasted each of them quite happily ! The big, airy bathroom was wonderful, with candles by the tub, heavenly smelling shower and soap and lotion amenities, a wonderful large shower with both an overhead rain head and a wall head, and thick towels to dry off with... A soft bathrobe awaited me in the closet, as did slippers... Evening turn down service was a welcome touch. Meadowood is evidently in the beginning stages of an 18 month planned renovation of the property, and the suite I stayed in was one of the newest re-do's... It was exactly what was shown on the website, and I was quite pleased. Prices are VERY high, so do ask before you make a reservation, as some of the rooms are much older, and may not be as luxurious -- until they have been remodeled/updated.

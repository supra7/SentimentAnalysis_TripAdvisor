The hotel was pretty standard - I wouldn't call it extraordinary but I can think of far more good things to say about it than bad. The location was great. I walked to Drumheller Fountain (central UW campus) in about 15 minutes and there is a bus stop directly across the street from the hotel with frequent buses that can take you right downtown, where we visited the waterfront and SAM. I think the hotel also has free shuttles until 7 PM but we didn't make use of those. It was an easy walk to the main U District shops/restaurants/thrift stores. The coffee/tea/hot chocolate served all day and mini cupcakes in the afternoon were a nice touch. The complimentary breakfast was pretty standard and a little crowded. There was also a Keurig coffeemaker in our Double Deluxe Queen room along with a fridge and a microwave, which I found to be very convenient for restaurant leftovers. We had a nice window, but the view wasn't anything special. The room and bathroom were about the standard size and quality you would expect and were very clean. The art on the walls was weird and bad but I'm pretty sure that's what hotels are for. The wireless worked great. I had some trouble with the TV in our room losing reception but that was the only real problem I encountered during our stay. Some things about the University Inn were similar to what you'd find at any standard chain hotel for about that price so I'm tempted to say it wasn't anything special, but the service was very good - we had to check out by noon but we couldn't take our stuff to the next place we were staying till the evening and lugging our bags around with us could have ruined our day, but the front desk held our bags for us for no charge and generally the staff seemed really attentive and helpful.

At first I was concerned about the amount of traffic noise from Roosevelt, but it wasn't a problem at night or in the early morning. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was fairly basic. The one nice surprise was the pineapple cupcakes every night from 3 - 7. The location on Roosevelt was a little tricky depending on where you need to go. Since it is one way, getting back up to the U-District can be a pain, especially in heavy traffic.

After trying to book more well known chain hotels with no real luck, I happened on the University Inn after consulting Yelp. We were not disappointed. We were going to visit the usual sites, but the the University Inn, true to its name, is located in the \"U-district\" near the University of Washington. Not exactly walking distance from the Space Needle and Pioneer Square. As luck would have it, this little gem of a hotel offered a free shuttle to all of the main attractions of Seattle and was willing to try to get you as close to possible to others. You do have to book the shuttle at least an hour in advance, though, so be ready to know where you want to go ahead of time. It also offered a pool and complimentary breakfast. Being from California, we took advantage of the heated pool frequently and the hotel provided fresh \"pool towels\" on deck as well. The breakfast suited our needs...waffle maker and variety of breakfast foods for most tastes. The evening cupcakes were just OK...they tended to the small size and the kids turned their noses up at the pineapple topping. The staff behind the front desk was for the most part quite helpful, but a few tended to toward the clueless when asked questions that were more in depth about Seattle. Overall though they were helpful and courteous. We tend to be low maintenance when our basic needs are being met. Being in Seattle, the hotel also provided \"hotel umbrellas\" for guests to borrow in case of inclement weather-another unexpected bonus, though it only sprinkled lightly on us one day out the 7 we were there. The University Inn is sister hotels with the Watertown Hotel, just one block up the street. Though the University does not have workout facilities...always a plus for our active family...guests have access to the basic workout facilities over at the Watertown. You just have to show your room key card to access them. The facilities were spartan, which is always disappointing, but they do have them and we did make use of them. There is no restaurant at the University Inn, but the Portage Bay Cafe is just a couple doors down. Hearty breakfast and lunch fare was a little on the pricey side, but the portions were generous. The Portage Bay Cafe may be owned and run by the same people that run the hotel since I used the cafe's WiFi and it came up as the \"University Inn\" wifi. Which brings me to my only real gripe....the wifi. If you are going to advertise free wifi then it should always work and it should be compatible with Mac and PC. I could not get online for most of the second day we were there. We wanted to purchase tickets to attractions online, but it proved difficult due to the balky nature of the wifi. The front desk was very NOT helpful telling me that the network sometimes has a hard time with Macs...which is a really lame excuse. They told me that they reset the server, but I was still unable to get online. I am pretty sure that the front desk knew nothing about the network compatibility or when it would come back online. The hotel does have a guest computer in the lobby and I was able to use it to order and print my passes to the Space Needle, but it was REALLY S-L-O-W. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the University Inn.

Very upsetting, taking pictures, filing a police report, trying to clean the urine stench out of the car etc. What was more upsetting, however, was dealing with University Inn management. We were told more than one version of what was seen or not seen on the surveillance tapes, why no action is taken when a car alarm in the parking lot goes off, they did not keep promises as to when management would actually call us back (we got a call 4 days later). But the nail in the coffin was when one of the managers was telling my husband that nothing was seen on the security tape--and then she said to my husband (loud enough so I could hear it from from my husband's cell phone) \"WELL SECURITY TAPES DON'T LIE!\" I could not believe she would say something that implied we faked a trashed car and our photos--and would be that rude to a guest.

Continental breakfast in the lobby is nice - you can make your own Belgian waffles or have some fruit, cereal, yogurt.

If you prefer something heartier and have more time (because there's usually a wait), the Portege Cafe has *wonderful* breakfasts - their specialty French toast dishes are absolutely delicious! Our room was on the Roosevelt street side, so it was noisy. The mini-fridge made strange noises as it cycled off and on so we ended up unplugging it at night. The A/C is wall-mounted, so the bed nearest it gets very cold while the other side of the room is okay. The bathroom is standard - one sink and vanity (with the wall-mounted hairdryer) is outside the door with another sink and a large counter space is in the bathroom itself. That makes it convenient for two people to brush their teeth at once. Wasn't crazy about having to hold down the button of the hairdryer to make it work, but maybe it was just that particular dryer. The front office staff is young, helpful and courteous. They were always smiling and welcoming when we returned from our trips to the campus. We liked the big bowl of candy on the counter, too! There is a small laundry room on the lobby level, and the use of the stacked washer and dryer is free for guests! Bring your own laundry detergent and fabric softener.

The rooms were spotlessly clean, and thank god, had air condioning in it. The bed was fantastic and I LOVED the feather pillows!!! There was also a lovely small porch overlooking the pool and parking lot, but we didn't bother going on it since it was 103 degrees outside. The staff were extremely nice and very helpful. Although we were not offered by them to be driven to the Mariners game, they did explain how to get there via bus. The pool was very nice and sunny and felt great on those hot days. The breakfast was good as well, there just aren't a lot of tables available to eat at so we had to eat with the trays on our laps on the couch. It also does get a little warm in the lobby with everyone making waffles. The complementary interenet with free printing was a dream come true!! It was frequently in use, but all the guests I saw didn't abuse the services by staying on for too long. We also used the shuttle one time on our way to Pike Place market. Make sure you make reservations as soon as possible! We reserved a 10am shuttle by 3pm the day before and had no problems, but I overheard another guest trying to get the shuttle for that same time the day of, and it was already full. Unfortunately, we didn't get to ride the shuttle back at the end of the day because there was an hour wait for pick up because we didn't make reservations ahead of time. One of the main public bus lines that ran to the university area was only around four blocks away from the hotel on University Ave which was great. The bus system was really easy to use, and at $2.00 (or less) per person, it was a cheap way to get around town. Just so you know, the bus does not give change and lines 71, 72, and 73 will get you from the university area to downtown and also to the Mariners game (although there is some walking to do after getting off the bus). These buses ran very frequently and I heard there are some routes going to downtown stops for free, we just didn't run into any of those. There were also tons of restaurants on University Ave as well. Everything from Thai food, Chipotle, burgers, Indian, seafood, and Mexican can be found, along with a Starbucks of course!! A lot of them are open until 11pm which keeps the area lit up and busy late at night. If you walk down to the water via University Ave you will also find a kayaking rental shop if you are interested in getting some exercise. We did park a rental car in the lot and it survived with no scratches. We rented from Budget on Roosevelt Ave which was great. It is around a mile away from the hotel so your could easily walk. I think we also passed an Enterprise on our way there as well. It is not the greatest looking neighborhood, but it wasn't horrible, just old and run down. You could save a ton of money buy picking up the car at this lot and dropping it off at the airport before you fly out. We used Express Shuttle from the airport to the hotel because the hotel staff recommended it as the cheapest way to travel. It cost $38 for 2 people plus gratuity. You can make reservations on line or just find the kiosk in the SeaTac parking lot on the 3rd floor and make a walk up reservation. We were the first stop in our shared van shuttle which was really nice. The only downside was that we were waiting for almost an hour before leaving, even though the company claims you'll be in transit w/in 25 min. All in all, I loved the area that the hotel was in, it is quiet and has a really nice college feel to it.

There are some good little restaurants but they cater to students so there's not going to be any fine dining close at hand. The nightlife is student oriented as well. That said, the hotel is clean, staff is helpful and friendly and it's not that far from downtown. Our room was big, although it faced the street so it was too loud to open windows. I didn't use their shuttle and it seems a bit limited in hours and destinations. If you're willing to ride a bus, you can get a lot of places pretty easily either from Roosevelt or \"The Ave\", which what University Way is always referred to. Call it by its real name and locals might be confused. The price was higher than the Mayflower downtown, but we'd booked pretty far in advance. I'm sure things had changed given the recession of the winter but my wife didn't want to try rebooking. Portage Bay cafe is next door and has a great breakfast.

Our jaded Chicago minds couldn't conceive of people being so nice and friendly at midnight.

They also had a variety of other breakfast options for those who aren't waffle crazed. Breakfast lasts until 10AM. Other hotels we stayed at usually wrap up breakfast by 8 or 9.

If you have allergies, you could choose an allergy friendly pillow. I mixed and matched my pillows just because I could.

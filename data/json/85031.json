The hotel does connect to the Doubletree next door, via some shops and a restaurant or two, thankfully, but this \"connection\" area has a musty odor. As for the guest rooms, mine at least was extremely small. While there were a few different pillows to choose from, I found none of them to be satisfactory. Fortunately, the bed itself was mostly comfortable. In much of the conference areas, cell phone and Wi-Fi reception were virtually non-existant. For a traveling professional, this made things extremely difficult as we all know work does not stop just because you're away from your desk.

In addition it cost $12.95 a day. In the lobby, there is wifi - for the same $12.95 a day. Overall the hotel is very nice. The service is superb. One of the reasons I love Marriott is their focus on service. It starts with the valet and continues till you depart. When I arrived, the valet was smiling and helpful - explaining the various parking options. Self-park for $26 a day or valet for $30. At the desk, the representative was pleasant and quick. The bellhop was awesome, he gave me a great orientation of the local things to do and pointed out several low cost shuttle options to area shopping districts. He told me about the free shuttle to South Beach and pointed out the location and times of the restaurant. He discussed the other hotel amenities like the pool and fitness center and pointed out where the rooms hair dryer could be found. In the restaurant, the waitstaff was patient and smiling. Three separate staff members stopped by to check my satisfaction or refill my drinks. The food was delicious and almost reasonable for a hotel restaurant. Lunch was pulled pork and salad for $12. The hotel is 5 minutes from a nice shopping area. There is also a shuttle ($5 each way) to the area's outlet mall which is about 25 minutes from the hotel. Between that and the free shuttle to south beach, I needed a new suitcase to get home my purchases! The rooms are spacious and I love that Marriott room safes are large enough to hold my laptop. My room had a nice view of the harbor. There is a decent sized fitness room with a variety of equipment and an AWESOME view. Makes you look forward to a morning or sunset workout! The pool is a good size with ample seating and lounges. There is an outside bar as well. Close to the pool is a hot tub. There are two additional reasons I seek out Marriott when I travel: 1) towels/washcloths: there are always plenty - I don't have to beg for them and 2) Marriott is a 'pepsi' hotel. THANKFULLY. I tolerate coke products at other chains, so I appreciate the pepsi! Yes, I know, not a reason to book a hotel...but we all have our needs! The hotel is a nice value for the area. Many of the boutique hotels (and I have stayed in several) are not as well taken care of, don't provide the service and attention to detail, and are only slightly less expensive.

It seems the staff has all been recently re-trained in customer service, so all of the attention was a bit over the top, with lots of reassurances that if we needed anything to be sure to ask, but the actual execution was not quite up to snuff. Parking was extremely expensive, our full-size van wouldn't fit into their regular garage, so we had to valet it, which was $40/night, but it was just outside the lobby door so it was very convenient. The biggest problem, though, was on checkout, when we discovered the parking had been upped to almost $66/night, so BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY! They dropped it back immediately when we complained, but I'm sure many a business traveler wouldn't have been so diligent and they would've gotten away with it. They're obviously making an effort, they just haven't worked out all the kinks yet. Spectacular views if you're on the bayside, our room had a balcony with a table and chairs which was very nice.

It's fairly close to the Miami Airport (about a $25-$30 cab ride). As most of the other reviews have noted, the hotel is located right on a Marina with a decent water view but there is no beach. It is very near the Port of Miami and I could see at least four cruise ships from my room. The lobby is attractive and modern. Check in was swift and painless. I was given a room on the 19th floor facing the marina and what I assume was an apartment building or condo. The room wasn't your typical box shaped. It had and odd curved shape because of the hotel architecture. It didn't bother me. There was a nice little balcony big enough for two small chairs and a side table. The bathroom was small, but nicely decorated and bright. The downside was that the door opened inward and nearly touched the toilet when opened. There was a combination shower/tub with a boring shower head with less than great water pressure. A nice sized flat screen HD television was attached to the wall. Next to is was a desk with multiple connections on the wall for your computer and other electronics. There is no wireless , but an Ethernet cable is provided. The trick is, you can't access the Internet via the plug in on the wall. The real connection is a small box under the desk. Be sure and turn off your wireless on your computer or you'll have difficulty connecting. The hotel also doesn't let you know that the room safe is located in the desk drawer and not in the closet like every other hotel you've ever been in. Fortunately, I'd read other reviewers warnings about this. I ordered room service the first night. The Customer Care people at the Marriott are excellent. My only complaint about room service was that the menu in the obligatory Hotel Services notebook was obsolete. You were supposed to use the room service menu provided in a separate card on the desk (with higher prices). Why they simply didn't remove the outdated room service information I don't know. The room service menu is fairly limited and pricey. But all of the items I had were well presented and tasty. The room service staff were friendly and swift. The first night I woke up at 3 a.m. to a loud party taking place at the apartment building across from the hotel. There was loud music blaring and people shouting from a veranda. Just when I was falling asleep again, a loud speaker within the hotel blared an announcement that there had been a false fire alarm and people could return to their rooms? I hadn't heard any alarm. The announcement was made several times. Another thing I need to note about the hotel room was that the carpet was filthy. My feet would be black on the bottom after walking around barefoot in the room. It was visibly dirty as well. Though housekeeping in general seemed fine and efficient. The Marriott is conveniently located near a peoplemover station. It is a short ride to the nearby Bayside Shopping complex with access to great restaurants and shopping. And it's free! There is also a small shopping center in the adjacent Doubletree Hotel that includes a few restaurants and shops as well as a small grocery/liquor store. That's about all there is within walking distance and Miami definitely isn't a pedestrian friendly city. The pool at the Marriott is very small and isn't heated. It was 82 degrees when I used it and it was freezing. There is a small bar at the pool where you can get limited food and beverage service. I did experience a few other oddities at the Marriott. There was someone staying on my floor that seemed to be practicing the trombone several hours a day. It was fairly loud in the hallway, but fortunately I couldn't hear it in my room. I also got stuck in the elevator one night when returning to my room. We used the intercom and were assured a building engineer would free us. In the meantime, one of the passengers forced open the door and we were able to use one of the other elevators. There is a nice business center where you can print boarding passes for free.

I do! But I also like internet access... Let's start with the positive: I attended a conference at Miami's Marriott Biscayne Bay in February. It is a beautiful hotel with nice staff, comfy beds, Bath and Body Works products, and an Illy coffee bar and separate restaurant. But my favorite amenity was the accessibly balcony from my room with a decent view of the bay. When I had to work, it was a luxury to get to do so while enjoying the ocean breeze. Sine I rarely left the hotel on this visit, I experienced most of what they have to offer. The conference rooms were nice, and the catered food was decent. I ate at the restaurant \"Catch\" once for dinner and once for bfast. Breakfast was great - a tasty egg white omelet with avocado and fruit (I appreciated the fruit substitution for hash browns). A bfast buffet was available, but I didn't want that much food.\u00c2\u00a0 And now the less-than-positive: My dinner experience at \"Catch\" was average. The service that night was awful, cigar smoke overpowered the deck, and the chef refused any substitutions for my friend who drove an hour to Miami to see me. That said, my salmon was good. (For dinner, walk around the block for sushi at Nove instead of eating at \" Catch.\") In addition to my not- so-great dinner experience, my only other complaint is the horrible ( and I mean horrible) Internet and cell phone coverage at this hotel.during the conference, I rarely even had a 3G/cellular signal to get text messages, much less Internet access. For a working mom on a business trip, this was frustrating. Even in the lobby, where wifi was \"free,\" I had to use my 3G access because the signal was so slow. In the rooms, Internet access is extra.\u00c2\u00a0 Marriott, it's time to catch up!

I thought my eyes must have deceived me because I was so high. An hour later, I went out to the balcony again and noticed that the shapes that I was guessing were manatees had moved. Now, convinced, I headed downstairs, down along the water and out to the last pier, where I recalled seeing them. I didn't see them in the water until I was almost on top of them on the pier. I stood there for quite a while enjoying them. Two other people came out saying that they had also seen them from their balconies. It was truly exciting and memorable and this alone made my stay at the Marriott Biscayne Bay wonderful! Although not at South Beach, the hotel is convenient to the beaches and local sites, but far enough away, that it feels isolated. At night, you can sit outside the bar on benches and enjoy the breeze and a good cocktail --- this was in January when everyone at home was freezing. The pool isn't anything to write home about, but, it's adequate. There's a pool bar and fitness center and a friendly front desk staff. The pool also has a hot tub - yea! The only bad part of the experience is that there is no wireless internet in the rooms. It's bad enough that internet is not included in the room. But, wired. Only wired! WTH?! I brought my Kindle Fire and could not use it in my room. What a waste. How is this a modern hotel? I felt like I was in some third world country! There is wireless internet in the lobby. But, I didn't want to hang out in the lobby. Rooms are OK. A nice coffee shop in the lobby with brewed Illy espresso. Nice.

The hotel is nicely located in Biscayne bay. Upon arrival we had some issues with checking in but management corrected the issue quickly. The hotel is fairly large with approx 26 floors. My room on the 7th floor was small but had 180 degree floor to ceiling views of the bay. I had a king bed room which faced this gorgeous view. Unfortunately, the walls are thin and the hotel restaurant bar extends outside with a live band on Thursday nights. I could hear very clearly and loudly every word, clap, laugh as well as the neighbors every loud sound. This would not have been an issue if I was on vacation and not attending a 7am conference. The hotel and rooms are nicely appointed and clean. The food supplied at the conference was somewhat disappointing. The hotel has an Illy coffee bar and a restaurant. I recommend the market deli next to the hotel. Great food, starbucks coffee, and snacks at a much more affordable price. We had drinks at our hotel restaurant and ate at Bleu Moon next door and had unfortunate experiences at both. The hotel also has a gym and an outdoor pool with a bar. The gym is very nice by hotel standards with plenty of equipment and great views of the bay. The pool is pretty small for a hotel of this size. The hotel is in walking distance of a dog friendly park and some restaurants. The hotel concierge also informed us of a free shuttle system which we did not have time to use. The parking for the hotel is $30 day for valet and $26 day for the garage. We parked in the hotel garage which was very convenient but beware the hotel adds the fee to your room. The assumption made by the hotel leads you to believe you must pay them for parking. This is a flat rate per day, but if you pay at the garage instead its based on hourly rates. I was over-charged by almost a full day. I spoke with management after my visit and they promptly credited my account. I was very impressed with Marriott's attention to customer satisfaction.

Reviewers who think this is a magnificent view must really like industrial chic. 2) I upgraded to the so-called concierge level so I would have Internet access without the hassle of daily fees only to be informed that I had to pay for Internet access. After complaining, the front desk \"comped\" the Internet; which, by the way is not wireless. Hello, Marriott this is the 21st century! 3) The room was small and cramped and the only light was from one sliding glass door (forget about a balcony, even though the photos strongly suggest that there are balconies). A Parent Tip - the railing across sliding door when it is open can not possibly be current code, because the top of it barely came to my waist and it wouldn't be all that difficult to flip over the thing when you are standing on the sliding door track. The door was also difficult to open and must date back to when the place was built. This is relevant because at 2:00 am when the wind picked up, it made a loud high-pitched noise because of gaps in the door. It was so disturbing I had to open the door to stop the whistling noise. It was a warm night so this was OK except the traffic noise from the causeway is considerable and, although I live in an urban downtown area and am used to traffic noise, it was quite loud. 4) I wanted to chill a bottle of wine, but no rooms have bar refrigerators in them. (?!) 5) The bed was OK except for the very thin bed linens that would be more at home at a cut-rate, motel than an expensive hotel. It made me wish I had brought my Bed Sack! 6) To top it all off when I ran a bath (the morning after a rather sleepless night because of the problems above) there was hair (as in many - and someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s!) floating in the water. This was the last straw... I packed up and checked out. I am a Marriott frequent-flyer and this isn't what I expect from Marriott. I love the Edgewater-Wynwood neighborhood and (as one of my previous reviews relates) have had great stays at the Grand where I will be sure to book for future trips to Miami. Add note: One good thing about my stay ... in my rush to leave this hotel, I left my cell charger and 'jammies in the room. Housekeeping bagged and tagged them and I was able to get them back. Taking the extra time to do this was nice on the part of the housekeeping staff. :-)", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel with nice view\u201d", "Author": "zula44", "ReviewID": "UR122235011", "Content": "We stayed three nights.

Valet parking was expected to be expensive, and it was, but as this was a special vacation we didn't mind the splurge. The bellhops unloaded our vehicle and brought all of our things to our room (and we had LOTS, including 3 huge boxes we had mailed to the hotel which contained our wedding favors!). The lobby is BEAUTIFUL! Being that we were the \"leaders\" of such a large group, we were upgraded to a Jr Suite - our room was 2102 and it was perfect. The view of the bay was gorgeous, our room was spacious, and served to be the perfect spot for us all to gather during our two nights there. The room only sleeps two with a king sized bed, but has a couch and plenty of room for cots. I had a chance to view some of the other rooms, which were all nice, clean, and average sized. Most of us ate at the restaurant for dinner, and some had breakfast. We all enjoyed our meals and found that surprisingly the restaurant had fair prices. The harbour view and accompanying ambiance was excellent. The staff at the hotel was amazing. Every time we needed to call the front desk (which was often when we needed to connect to others rooms) we were greeted warmly and they always congratulated us, calling us either the bride or the groom. We didn't walk around the surrounding area, but many of our friends did during the day time and we heard no complaints. Taxis to South Beach were under $15 and it was a short commute. We found it well worth the cost of the taxi to stay in a well priced, beautiful hotel like this (rather than pay more to stay on South Beach in a not-as-nice-hotel). Thank you sincerly to the staff at the Marriott - we hope management reads this and passes that on for us. We were so happy with our stay and couldn't have picked a better hotel.

The hotel has a good structure and on a very good condition: nice lobby, good restaurant with reasonable breakfast (buffet), common parking is a bit expensive. The additional price for valet parking really is worth it, especially for those traveling with small children and of course a lot of baggage. I chosed valet almost everyday. The rooms: VIEW: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed on a low floor with a terrible view on the first stay and on a high floor (25 floor), with a postcard bay view on the second stay. SIZE: Space is definitely not a problem for the rooms, we had lots of luggage and shopping bags, and it still feels comfortable. Equipments: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NO refrigerator and NO microwave. The expensive Cable Internet requires the guest to go to down the comfortable lobby to use free internet wifi.

Used Marriott Reward points to book a basic room. I had originally booked us to stay at the Hotel Beaux Arts Marriott in downtown Miami, but some friends told us that the view at Biscayne Bay is much better. Explained to the manager, Ms. Ready, that my wife and I are celebrating our 15th Anniversary. We were complimentary upgraded to a corner jr. suite, room 1901 on 19th floor. PERFECT! Not too high, not too low, just right to see out into the bay, south beach area and all of the cruise ships. Quite amazing watching a heavy rain storm move over the bay towards us on Sunday afternoon. We have stayed at JW Marriott Resort properties in Palm Springs and Phoenix previously and the level of amenities and room decor is very similar. This corner suite view cannot be beat, the best view we have had in any upscale property. Food: Upon arrival we dined at the Catch Restaurant located on property. The breakfast buffet is served until 1pm, so I had that. Very good selection. Especially the chicken-apple sausage link. We called the front desk Sunday evening to get a local phone number to a Pizza Hut (chose not to use room service for pizza). Upon arrival the front desk called me to inform me that delivery persons are not allowed to go to rooms and I would have to come down and get my pizza. So, beware if you order any takeout to be delivered, DO NOT change into night clothes too soon! Bathroom: The toilet and bathtub/shower area are in a separate space that is very small compared to other Marriott properties, but then again you don't spend that much time in this space. The sink area has a single sink with large granite counter top. Dining area: Since this was a suite we had a nice dining area with a round table and 4 chairs. Surrounded by floor to ceiling glass windows. Seating area: This suite has a nice full size couch, 2 end tables, 2 chairs and a coffee table. There is a work desk provided with a nice, rolling desk chair. Internet: All rooms must be connected with the wired internet, meaning I could not sit on the bed and work on laptop. In today's time, this seems very dated. Balcony: There is no balcony in this room. You can open the sliding glass door to let the breeze in and the curtains blow in the wind, but there is only a small railing area. You cannot step out onto it. But again, with floor to ceiling windows wrapping around on 3 sides of this room who needs a balcony!!! Service: Everyone was very accommodating and attentive to customer needs. I do not have 1 negative experience to report. Area: I can't comment on the availability of night life since we were not here for that. I do know it is not within walking distance of South Beach or the Brickell area. You would need to take a cab for that. I had read previous reviews that the area seemed seedy or unsafe but we did not experience or see that. I think it is because it is a property that is between the DoubleTree on one side and a nice, beautiful old Episcopal Church on the other side, making it seem \"stuffed\" into the land. But once you get into your room and look at the view you will soon forget about all of that. The room did not contain a refrigerator or microwave. I was surprised to see incandescent bulbs still being used in the bedside lamps. Also, the wind blows all night and you can hear whistling through the sliding glass door. This can be annoying, so we turned the FAN part of the a/c system on HI to drown out that whistling. Hopefully management can have the weather stripping reinforced.

CHECK-IN Originally they were going to put me on the 3rd floor, but I asked if they would bump me to a higher floor with a \"nice view\" since I was staying so many nights. The woman checking me in was friendly and very accommodating. I arrived at 3 PM and my room was ready. ROOM I had 1912 which had a perfect view of the cruise port so I could see the ships coming in and out. It had two queen beds, a sliding glass door. Linens were pretty standard (white duvet). Bathroom was fine (not overly impressive). Very clean. LOBBY To me, the lobby feels dated. I know they just updated it with the new Marriott \"pods\" (which are kind of cool, I admit) but overall I have seen a lot of nicer properties. RESTAURANT The lobby restaurant has good food but be prepared to wait. Service people are friendly but it takes a looooong time to be served. I ate quite a few meals there over my stay and it never got better. TIPPING NOTE: Miami restaurants appear to uniformly add the tip IN ADVANCE regardless of how many are in your party. I'm from DC and you don't see the tip added unless there are 6-8 or more in your party. In Miami, it appears to always be added up-front. I don't know why, but I accidentally double-tipped two or three times because I would forget and just add it without checking. We saw this at every single restaurant in South Beach, Brickell, and Miami downtown. At first I found it very annoying! LOCATION I was there for an onsite event, so that was fine. But honestly this place is a little removed from the action. It's nowhere near South Beach, it's a hike to Brickell area, the surrounding area didn't seem that walkable or exciting. There is a restaurant in walking distance called City Hall that was quite delish. HOUSEKEEPING Eh. It was fine but three days out of nine I had to call down to housekeeping (around 4ish) to make sure they were going to come change towels (etc). I had my do-not-disturb on my door in the mornings until 7ish and apparently that was late enough to take my room out of the regular rotation. Wasn't crazy about that. But I will say that the room was spotlessly clean. I was perplexed that on the first night I had three washcloths (and I use two daily for washing my face; one in the morning and one at night) and then for the rest of my stay they only supplied one washcloth per day. Odd. ROOM SERVICE Ordered it a few times. Service was prompt. Pizza was especially good. FINAL \"SCORE\" I felt like the hotel was a solid property that did a nice job catering to guests.

We made some requests, and all of them were granted, except for an upgrade to a bayview suite, once it was our wedding anniversary. The room given to us was nice, clean, well appointed. The king bed is excellent, very comfortable. The room is not very big, the bathroom is very small. But the lack of space is compensated by an excellent view (even though not the bay view we asked for), and also for a very nice (again narrow), balcony. Our rate included breakfast, and it was a very nice one. All sorts of food and drinks. The only problem I found is that, although the hotel is huge (many rooms), the breakfast area is small. Sometimes, you have to wait on a line to get a table, or you have to sit on a table which is far from the breakfast area, if you don't want to wait. The location is very nice, very close to downtown and the bayside market. As for the cons, for us the biggest flaw is not to offer complimentary wi-fi in the rooms. They offer it in the lobby, but nothing is better than to speak to you family through skype in the privacy of your room. Despite that, sometimes you have to fight for a space to sit in the lobby to comfortably use the wi fi connection in your device. Why not allow wi fi at the whole building? In the era we live in, it's a huge disappointment not to offer complimentary wi fi in the rooms. The parking is also extremely expensive, even for self parking. The first night we arrived, and surprise! There wasn't a single spot for us to park our car in the lot! We had to go all the way down again, talk to the person in charge for the lot, who told us to park our car in a space reserved for disabled people!! I think it is an absurd (the reserved area must be respected at all costs). The problem is that they shouldn't sell more parking spaces than they actually have to offer. But anyway, this happened only once, we warned the front desk, but let's face it, it could've been prevented. Lastly, we needed help from the concierge service for an urgent matter, but the concierge desk didn't help at all.

One thing I liked, if you ordered room service or at one point I needed extra towels, about 20 minutes after delivery someone calls just to verify you got what you wanted. The hotel is very near the port and also to the Bayside shopping center. We took a cab there for dinner for around $10. The hotel was clean and the staff excellent but my only complaints are that the coffee shop closes early - around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. and I thought that was strange. I would have liked to have had a pre-bed cappuccino, but we had to have a latte from room service instead. (they don't have cappuccino for room service.)

She was curt and unhelpful from beginning of our check-in up until the end. However our second encounter with the same clerk was even worse than the first. We reserved through the Marriott's main reservation number for our second stay, before leaving Florida and this was one week later. We were told the room type was unavailable. It was clear this clerk did not belong in a front desk position. She was very abrupt when we made inquiries abt the reservation and the room's availability, to the point we were unable to complete the sentence. We specifically requested to see the hotel manager, and the clerk called the front desk manager. While she was apologetic for her staff members behavior, the room was still not ready for check-in. We later decided to cancel before the deadline mentioned by the Marriott reservation desk and stay elsewhere due to the confusion with the clerk, check-in and just bad customer service.

The room was good, you could tell that it had been updated. It was clean and a very good size. I would have rated higher, but the customer service was lacking. To be fair, it did seem like there were many employees who were trying their best to do a good job. There were a few though that seemed to be either overwhelmed or not really interested. Here's my story: Got to the hotel and hour before check-in. My room wasn't available yet, no big deal. The front desk girl asked if I wanted to be put on a list to get a call when my room was ready. I said yes and then mentioned that I'd hang out at the hotel cafe until the room was ready. She advised against this and stated that it could be a few hours before my room was ready. Really?? So, I left my bag at the hotel and went to walk around the city for awhile. I headed back to the hotel at 5:30 after never getting a call that my room was ready, thankfully it was (I was awake since 3:30am and had an early morning photo shoot scheduled for the next day). I ended up getting the same front desk person. She checked me in, gave me my keys and then just looked at me. I noticed that she was at least explaining where the hotel pool and elevators were to the other people, but not to me. It's not really easy to find the elevators or pool if you've never been to that hotel. She was probably just overwhelmed or something, but she wasn't very cordial. After that, I had to wait 15 minutes to get my bag. The issue was that the bellhop couldn't find my bag, but before he admitted that, he said, \"We'll bring it up to your room.\" Glad I refused that and stayed in the lobby, otherwise it would have been even more of a hassle to get it. I had to go in to the luggage room and point out which one it was, even though there was a claim ticket on it. At check out, I tried to use the TV check out system, but could not find that option on the menu screen, so I was forced to check out at the front desk. Big mistake. It took a very long time and many of the other guests seemed to be annoyed. It seemed like there were some operational issues that prevented the staff from doing a good job (and there were some staff that seemed not to care too much, for example the girl who checked me in). The other things that would have been nice: a light blanket in addition to the sheet and heavy comforter, quieter air conditioning, free use of internet in the business center. So, the rooms are good, and seems to be a good location if you're going on a cruise. Since this hotel has gotten good reviews about customer service, my experience may be out of the norm. But I still wouldn't go back and probably would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Note to hotel staff who may read this: You'll see that I don't often give out bad reviews on this site, so I'm not just complaining to be annoying.

The only minor detail was the service. Once you tell the waitress or waiter you are having buffet, they serve you coffee and you don't see them again. My child is a culinary major and these are the little things that can ruin a good place. The dining room staff has to be more attentive whether it is ala carte or buffet dining.

She said it wasn't, but would another room be OK? Why didn't the first clerk offer that and save us the waiting? Also, breakfast (which was included in our room rate, fortunately) was $44 for two of us. It was very good, and the orange juice was the best I've ever had, but not worth that much money. The room was very nice and comfortable. I read reviews about the noise coming through the balcony doors, and it's true. They are not very soundproof. But overall we enjoyed the room.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMiami Marriott Biscayne Bay saved our honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "sobegirl611", "ReviewID": "UR114076485", "Content": "What started out as a horrible honeymoon beginning in St. Thomas, ended with 3 glorious days at Miami Marriott.

I chose this hotel because it is well located (near Miami Beach, in a nice area), it is a Marriott brand and because the rate could be considered good. The service at the check-in is good, personnel is well-prepared and speak good English (something not so easy to get at the Miami area). The room I got was at the end of a corridor, in a corner of the hotel. So the room was not completely rectangular, and even though there was a lot of area, space was not so well utilized. However there were some large floor-to-ceiling windows with a partial view to the bay. However there are other buildings nearby, so curtains where closed most of the time for privacy. There was also a small balcony. TV was modern with lot's of channels. I had a negative surprise in discovering that there was no wifi at the rooms. The only internet available is with a cable, and it was paid. There is however free wifi at the hotel lobby, so you will find lot's of people with their equipment there. You can tell the room was recently renewed. The bathroom was really small, no space for 2 people at all in there. Shower in a tub, and a very low ceiling, as it is common in older facilities. Miami is a place hot and with humidity, so the hotel did a nice job trying to maintain the room without the feeling of humidity and its smells. However room carpet seemed like it needed to be washed, with some stains. You will find it hard to place in the room 2 large pieces of luggage (in my case there were more...). Parking is very expensive, even with self parking. Breakfast was not included in my rate and also very expensive. There is a coffee shop at the lobby where you will find an excellent espresso. But they don't sell sandwiches until 10.30, probably not to compete with the hotels breakfast. So overall, a better staff than you would find in other hotels in Miami area, a good location. But no wifi at the rooms (!!!) and some extra charges that can impact your budget in 30 or 40% of your rate (breakfast+parking).", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Views and High Prices\u201d", "Author": "Eric34328", "ReviewID": "UR113266733", "Content": "This motel has great rooms and the amenities are many, however expect to pay a high price here for parking, food and internet access.

When I landed in Miami, I immediately called the hotel, so that they can send a shuttle to pick me up. They were very quick to say that there was no shuttle service, and offered no other options. Now, it was my mistake to assume that they had shuttles (as every other hotel does), but suggesting safe options would have been appreciated. I ended up sharing a cab with a couple of people heading to the same hotel for the same conference. When I arrived at the hotel (10:30am), the woman at the front desk told me that there were no rooms available, and I would need to wait for a room to open up. She couldn't even give me an approximate time of when I should return. Trying to turn lemons into lemonnade, I took the opportunity to tour the neighborhood, and found that there was absolutely nothing for me to do... no stores to shop (the mall across the street was shut down), barely any restaurants, or even any scenic views. I actually had enough time to hop on the monorail (which was free.... but had no seats...), and met very \"interesting\" people. In the end... I waited for 4 HOURS for a room!! At this point, I was so exhausted... but I knew that I had to be at the conference, which was to start at 3pm. When I finally arrived in my room, I was not AT ALL impressed by the the horrible view of concrete, miniscule view of the Bay, and the bathroom which was so small that you couldn't turn or move without hitting your knee on the toilet!!!! If I ever go back to Miami Biscayne Bay, I will stay FAR away from the Marriott... It definitely wouldn't have been my first pick... or second!!", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamloops", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, comfortable, great views\u201d", "Author": "Rellybell", "ReviewID": "UR95225924", "Content": "Stayed at the Marriott before disembarking on a cruise.

They ran out of food, plates and utensil so fast people put scrambled eggs in coffee cups and ate them with spoons! We ate twice at the new upscale restaurant that -- $41 for two breakfast buffet and about $90 for a dinner -- very good food! You will need to park your car in the $26 a day lot.

I am a Gold Elite member of Marriott and truly rely on Marriott to make my frequent travels more bearable. However, this does not seem to be the case with the Biscayne Bay Marriott location. I stay at this Marriott every time I visit Miami. I have always looked forward to the quality of service I have experienced at this hotel. Even times that I have been there for weeks at a time, it was never a chore coming back to the hotel after a long day of conferences or working the docks for hours on end during the Miami Boat Show. A few years ago they began a much needed renovation on the rooms, which has been very nice. The lobby and restaurant areas are now under renovation and I fully understand that these upgrades are needed as the years pass. I state this because I could not get the management to understand that the renovation was not the problem, with the exception of the low floor level, on my latest stay, it was their lack of concern about the customer. Upon check in, the majority of my room preferences listed in my Marriott profile were ignored. My profile requests a high level floor. I was given a low level floor with a very poor view that suffered greatly from vibration and noise from the renovation construction. This became extremely distracting while trying to conduct business remotely and develop presentations for the conference. Because the lobby was under construction cabs were forced to navigate a parking garage that is obviously navigable by valets. When I would return from a meeting, I would have the cab stop outside so that I could enter the hotel on my terms not theirs. Security constantly yelled at the cab driver for following my instructions and when I would try to explain that they were simply following my wishes they would then aim their tirade at me. I finally gave up and told the cabs to drop me at the Double Tree next door to avoid confrontations. I checked about changing rooms and was told that I would not get the same type of room if I moved up to a higher level. I checked about changing to the Marriott on Miami Beach and was told that the Biscayne manager was unable to talk with the manager at the Miami Beach Marriott. So I decided to stay put and deal with the noise. However, upon trying to find a new hotel, I discovered that my current hotel had a better rate for Marriott Rewards Elite members and subsequently requested that rate, to which I was told no problem. Upon receiving the bill which had myriad of charges for internet services that were free to Gold Elite members, I found the rate had not been changed to the Elite rate. I promptly called the front desk and requested the front desk manager. The person who answered, I asked if I was speaking to the manager and he answered yes. I inquired about why my rate had not been changed and he stated that only a manager can change a rate. I stated to him that he identified himself as a manager to which he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cannot change your rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Once I finally got a real manager on the phone, I was told that the convention host had given instruction to the Biscayne Marriott not to change rates for Elite members. Apparently, I was not the only one who discovered this Elite rate. This is the point at which Miami Biscayne Marriott told me that conventions bring them a lot of business and they do not want to upset the convention planners. I promptly informed her that the convention doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care where the people stay because their competitor next door was also a preferred hotel and who they had upset were loyal customers that stay at Marriotts all over the world. She apologized and offered my bonus reward points, which I gladly accepted and informed her that I would use at the Marriott World Center in Orlando, which their hotel could take some pointers from. Ironically, she disclosed that World Center is the hotel that Marriott Corporate uses as a training example for their other locations, but I digress. What would now seem an end to a horrific stay in Miami simply refused to end. Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay would not send me my e-folio (e-statement), since I have chosen to go paperless and consequently could not submit to my company for reimbursement. They also would not acknowledge my stay in the rewards program for Marriott Rewards nights and points. I repeatedly called the hotel requesting the e-folio and nights credited for the stay. I always requested to speak with a manager and was always told that they were unavailable, but that they could see where I had stayed with them and they would correct the matter and have a manager call me to discuss the situation. In short, no manager ever called back. After 10 days of fighting this, I called Marriott Rewards Customer Service. They were able to verify my stay and within 20 minutes I had an e-folio sent to my account and within 12 hours had reward points and nights credited for my stay. This is the type of service that Marriott Reward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members have come to highly respect about Marriott Hotels. I will continue to stay with Marriott, but the next time I need to be in Miami, I will stay at the Miami Beach Marriott or if I need access to the Miami Boat Show docks, I will stay at their competitor next door the Double Tree Hotel. I would like to thank Marriott Reward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Corporate Customer Service for your quick resolution to Biscayne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ineptness and I look very forward to my next stay at Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Center in Orlando.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cVer good, fine and good service\u201d", "Author": "MikeNewYork80", "ReviewID": "UR68160778", "Content": "I travel to Miami two times a year and I booked the Miami Marriot for the first time and I must say that I was very happy with my room and service of all the staff.

Smart move not putting that on the site Marriott. In any case - the manager on duty that day decided since it was cloudy nobody would be at the pool so they didn't find someone to replace the bartender. Smart move, Miami weather never changes right? Even I know this and I live in New York. An hour later it was sunny and beautiful, but no pool bar or food at the pool. When we decided we wanted a cocktail, the front desk made us go all the way up to our room to call for room service and they would bring it down to the pool. 50 minutes later, the drinks arrived wrong. Last I checked, the front desk at a hotel is very capable of calling for room service and in this situation, with the hotel under construction and very poor judgment by the manager to not replace the bartender, you would think they would call for us.

I have had way better lobster bisque, a salad and a glass of wine and my bill still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t $24.00. As the remainder of the my guest arrived later that night the weather took a turn for the worst and it began to storm, so needless to say we were left to dine at the hotel. Once again, sadly, the food served was below average, but for bartender kudos to her, because the ladies gave the cocktails 2 thumbs up! The following morning we checked out, which went way smoother than the check-in, vowing never to stay at this particular Marriott hotel again! For anyone taking a cruise and if you are not picky about where you stay, then the location of this hotel is ideal. However, I would advise that you reconsider and look into other hotels that will offer great location, great food and a great staff. Don't go for this hotel thinking that it is up to Marriott standards because it really falls short. I give it a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. With 5 being the highest.

I had read the reviews that mentioned the place had undergone a serious remodeling/upgrade in the previous few months. I was pleasantly surprised by this property--fabulous furnishings. We stayed just at the end of a huge tennis event in the Miami area. So the hotel was hopping with folks from the tennis event. But that did nothing to deter our stay. Check-in was a breeze. We did get a slight upgrade to a waterfront view because of my Marriott Rewards status. Because we checked in at night, we didn't get the full view until the next morning. Amazing view. I think we were on the 23rd floor. Once the sun rose, a great view of the bay/port and all of the cruise ships getting ready to head out. View was very impressive. Room had definitely seen a recent upgrade in bedding. Probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on in quite a while. I do travel fairly regularly. So I get my share of hotel stays. This bed was extremely comfortable. Room was a decent size. We had king--with a small chair and foot stool on the window side of room. Also had an adequate desk area if you need space for laptop and some work space. TV was flat-panel with HD channels. Ordered room service and food was good--no issues. Also able to go down the hall and get a soda for $1 out of machine. Didn't know there were any $1 vending machines left in the world?? Only downside to room was shower/tub. This area is getting old and outdated. Not a lot of room in shower compared to most nicer properties. One plus was the lighting in bathroom. Did have light that encircled the vanity mirror. My wife loved this aspect when it came to fixing her hair and putting on makeup--loved the great lighting. All in all, this is great property.

Needless to say, we all started showing up around the same time. We also all booked via Priceline and got a terrific rate. The staff handled the crowd very, very well. From the baggage handlers to reception, everyone was polite and had a smile. We were through check in and up to our room in no time. We did ask for a lower floor with a view, which we got but it was directly across from the vending/ice machines which is a huge no-no in my book, but decided to overlook it this time. Turned out to be a small deal but not a big one regarding noise. The room was quite comfortable and clean - we slept great. The shower had amazing water pressure - it was the best part of the stay!! We hadn't eaten all day so decided on an early dinner in the hotel restaurant. It was practically empty during the early bird time we went. We were seated at a banquette with a lovely view of the marina. Service was prompt and courteous. The food? Meh. Some was good, some was really not worthy of the expense. And expensive it was. $100 for 2 with just having 2 drinks, soups, salad and one entree. But we were in warm Miami, relaxed and being served well, so whatever. We all met at the bar that night, maybe about 80 or so people and the bar service was just fine - very nice bartenders and no one was left holding an empty glass for long. The next day, we took a walk around the property along the water and part way across the causeway. For breakfast, we did go to the food court for eggs and such. There's a store for any incidentals one might have forgotten and snacks and things if you want to buy that before the cruise. We stocked up on waters, energy bars, aloe, etc. Again, everyone checked out around the same time and all were looking for taxis to the marina. There was a huge crowd that was dispatched efficiently and without drama. We were on our way with an acceptable wait time. Seems like they are pros at moving the cruise crowds along. There was only one woman at the front desk that morning who wasn't exactly Miss Personality, but even she was helpful (I asked her to make a copy for me because there was no paper in the copier in the business center), if not the most pleasant.

So that colors my image a bit - all hotels were ridiculously expensive that weekend and I probably wouldn't have been happy with any for the asking rate! We stayed here for two nights before a cruise. We stayed at the Hyatt the night after the cruise and I'll write a review for that as well. (Which would I choose? They both had good and bad - I'd take whichever gave me a better deal but I thought the Hyatt had a bad pool/fitness room but a better location.) That said, getting there was easy - about $25 cab from the airport. The room was nice - we had a small balcony that overlooked the bay and the Doubletree pool area next door. Two chairs and a small table - I doubt more than two people would be comfortable out there, though - it was tiny! The room was decent sized, had a nice closet and an OK bathroom/sink area. Toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion) were by Bath and Body Works. There was not a fridge in the room. And no full-length mirror - what's with that??? It was the same at the Hyatt! There was a small \"mall\" between the two hotels (Marriott and Doubletree) where you could get something to eat and there were a few shops there. The hotel lounge was nice and the service was good but of course it was very expensive as with any hotel food. (Tip - the food was the same price in the lounge as it was from room service, though you probably had to pay a delivery and/or service fee for room service. But it you really prefer room service it's probably worth it. We figured the prices would be a bit cheaper downstairs but they were not.) Tip about Miami in general that I read specifically about South Beach - some (most?) restaurants will add gratuity to the bill right away - so check that before you decide how much to tip! The lounge didn't do this but we ate at Tradewinds at Bayside and they did add 15% to the bill. We did not use the pool but we could see it from our room and walked down there one day. It was OK but the pool at the Doubletree looked nicer. There was also a hottub and they had a ping pong table set up down there. It was a nice big area so if you wanted to just lay in the sun or shade there were plenty of areas to do so. You could also get down to the waterfront easily from the lobby area and it was nice to stroll along the sidewalk along the water - there are lots of boats at the marina right there. The fitness room was quite good - several weight machines (sorry - don't belong to a gym so I can't say if they were diverse enough but they looked pretty new) and several treadmills, ellipticals and bikes. They all had a TV but I found the sound and TV to be hit or miss on them. One I couldn't turn the channel and another I couldn't get any sound. The other one I used had sound SOMETIMES so if being entertained while running/elliptical/biking is important, bring your I-pod - they all had a connection for that. They did have headphones available in the fitness center for the machines, which was nice. The best thing about the fitness room is that you could easily see the cruise port from the room. Nice view! The hotel is not really near much as far as walking distance but the metromover is just at the end of the street (not even a full block) and it's free so it was very easy to get to Bayside Market where they have stores and lots of restaurants. It was a really fun place. Getting back was far more difficult for us as we kept thinking we were going the wrong way and we'd get off, examine the maps, get on the next train and find the same problem again. I'm sure someone more experienced in public transportation would fare better. (We did finally get back but we switched trains several times!) The people on the metromover were OK but I wouldn't ride it alone (as a woman) and I would either be back to the hotel before dark (the area around the hotel was OK but it wasn't super well-lit and there were few people around) or take a cab - I imagine it's not more than $10 from Bayside. We did the Island Queen boat tour at Bayside (there are lots of boat tours and I imagine they're all about the same). They leave often so you should be able to find one that suits your timeframe. Island Queen also had a lot of other tours with discounts if you paired things (i.e. boat tour and a hop-on-hop-off city tour, Everglades tour, etc.) We took a taxi to the cruise port, which was $9.30 before tip and took only 10 minutes or so. Pretty easy. We tried to do self-checkout on the TV before we left but when I checked the bill I found that they'd charged us for one night of parking (over $20 but I don't recall how much) so we had to go to the desk to get that charge removed. They were very friendly and easy to deal with both at check in and check out. I would definitely stay here again - if you really want to be close to action, I'd choose either something closer to Bayside or someone in South Beach but this was perfect for two nights and essentially one day in Miami before a cruise.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNot At All Impressed\u201d", "Author": "DurhamFossil", "ReviewID": "UR58322302", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in February.

When we arrived we were totally exhausted, we had a plane from Stockholm leaving early in the morning for New York, there we had to wait for the plane to Fort Lauderdale and then grab a cab to the hotel. We arrived at 8 in the evening at the hotel but our time back home was already 5 in the morning, so you can imagine... We got a room on the 10th floor, at last some sleeping we thought. But no... They had placed us in a room next to the elevators so that we had the elevator-sound on one side of the bed and from the other side there was a terrible noise from some fan-outlet in the yard. But we were too tired to get dressed again and change the room, so we slept restlessly some hours. The bathroom was not clean, a lot of hair lying around on the floor and in the bath-tub.

We had a small balcony, a huge building in front of us but if you looked between these two buildings you could see the sea. But not anyone would like to sit on that balcony without ear-plugs, because of the noise coming from the ground.

But I was really happy we decided to stay outside Miami Beach as it was quite and still very convenient (we hated the traffic jams and no parking space in Beach area). You will definately need a car to get around (cabs can cost you more than car rental) but the hotel location is perfect - 5 minutes to Miami Beach, 5 minutes to highways entrance that will get you to the Keys or Miami downtown and 5 minutes to Miami Bayside Marketplace (while in Miami you really cannot miss Miami Thriller Powerboat adventure!). The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was large and comfortable. And I loved to end up each night on the little balcony watching the bay and Miami skyscrapers. We tried the restaurant located on the 1st floor of the hotel and found it quite nice - the hamburgers and salads are much better than most of stuff offered at Ocean Drive. There are many shops and little bars on the hotel's ground floor where you can buy food, drinks, magazines, etc. We tried the breakfast for the first day but were not satisfied with it (for the price you pay could be better) but it was no problem for us because there is a nice bar in the lobby with Starbucks coffee and bagels.

I highly recommend the gulf grouper if you decide to eat there. The rooms are very nice and appear to be newly renovated. The iPod alarm clock was a wonderful plus. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows of differing firmness and size. Plenty of outlets for charging phones, laptops, etc. I had no issues with maid service.

Unfortunately, Miami Beach was hit by a severe thunderstorm on the day before this Saturday and the disaster flooded Eden Roc's parking lot.

We could actually see our Cruise and the Port from where we were! The room was very clean. It had a 37inch LCD TV. The bathroom had a very luxury design on the mirror. They also offered bath and body works shampoo , conditioner as well as body lotion.The gym and the pool was also very nice. Internet is an additional charge though (do not know how much) The location of the hotel wasn't bad either. It was relatively close to a bus station (a 2 - 5 min walk from the lobby) that took us to Miami beach area. The bus ride from there to Miami Beach area (south beach area) was about a 10 - 15 min ride with a bus fare of 2 dollars per person. (We didn't have a car).

Problems may have existed during construction but not now. Trip was business. Stay was 4 days. Walking around the hotel is safe and worry free. Walk to train station is less than 2 minutes, walk to street make left and first right and you're at the train/bus stop. Train is free and above ground and will take you most places you need to see or go to. Bus is $2.00 and will take you to Collins ave in south beach. Rooms with a \"bay view\" are nice for the added price and if you like that bonus- go for it. Rooms that I saw that had the \"city view\" were nice too, the lights of the city are so nice at night if you are in a room above the 15th floor. You can look at your room if you wish to see what you are getting if needed ( I asked the desk mgr.) No problem with the very attentive staff, especially the guys who work the bellman and cab starter positions, these guys are all over you and your luggage to get you a cab or up to your room. Oh well they need the tips too. Bathroom area is good size but nothing like a \"residence inn\" but roomy enough, King size bed room is fine with a chair at desk and a reading chair with a ottoman to rest your legs on. TV was a 40 inch or so wide screen HDTV and a great selection of channels to watch. Go to the Bayside shopping area is a great idea for food and tourist shops. Bubba Gump, Hooters, and Hard Rock are the chain food places. A very nice Italian place looked good and of course bars galore with bar food and snacks right at the waters edge, perfect to watch the boats coming and going from the harbor. Very safe here too- many plainclothes officers and uniformed cops all over the place. We were told \" do not go west of there\" OK we did not and were fine. Panhandlers were few and of course a cop was shagging them out. Walk to the train station is about two blocks and safe for the walkers or catch a cab. We knew a few couples who walked to bayside and took the train back to the hotel, You can see the hotel from the street so it's about 20 minute walk or so. If you want to be in the \"action\" stay elsewhere on south beach but if you happen to get booked here - its just fine and dandy. We in our group of 200 had hardly any problems to speak of.

They're headquartered just outside the city in Maryland. Many years ago I worked there, and many years before that my father worked side-by-side with J.W.

Unfortunately, I have to say that this hotel needs a lot of work before it can live up to the Marriott name. Be forewarned that they are in the midst of a renovation at this hotel. All the rooms have been nicely redecorated, but the work continues on the rest of the building. Sadly, I paid extra for a bay view room, but I was never told about the construction when I reserved the room for the New Years holiday. Because of the construction, the sliding glass doors in all the rooms on the bayside have been bolted shut and are inoperable. So there are no bay air breezes. In our room the windows were extremely dirty and so poorly sealed that when the winds picked up, there was a high-pitched whistle that was intolerable. Also, the maid failed to clean the room after my first night's stay. I'm not sure how that happens. The elevators were slow and crowded. So expect long waits. The doors in one elevator car wouldn't even shut with out some manual assistance. Also, the elevator to and from the garage is very dirty and malodorous. My kid insisted on holding his breath every time we got in it. It was somewhat pathetic. When I pay over $300 a night for a room, I expect a better class of accommodations. I don't think what I received was worth more than $200. While the front desk staff were professional, helpful and good natured, the management was not overly generous when it came to restitution. In their defense, they did move us to a room on the poolside of the hotel and agreed to knock off $50 from the first night's stay, but it took a few of trips to the front desk to get it all straightened out.

The bay view rooms have a sliding glass door that leads out to a 3 inch faux balcony. This was kinda disappointing. The room was also pretty nasty. The carpet was old and crusty and I actually walked around with sandals on which I never do. The television was outdated, no flatscreen here. The walls probably got pained over a couple years ago and look fine. There was nice crown molding by the sliding doors which was a nice touch. Now comes the bathroom from the 70's.

Each morning we woke up to this incredible view of the harbor and port. I cannot even begin to explain how beautiful this view is. There is one restaurant on property. We had dinner there and thought that the food was very good. We also ordered room service and it was promptly delivered and tasted delicious. We had concierge access which is on the 26th floor.

We did take a look at the pool and spa. They both looked nice, but we did not have time to use them. I am sure that if you got a room and it smelled, the hotel would change your room.

The hotel itself seemed safe, but I wouldn't go venturing out unarmed and on foot after dark. My stay was average at best. I arrived to find a cruise line group checking in. The line was out the door, and I followed a co-worker that lied and said we were Marriott Rewards Platinums at check-in. Otherwise, judging from the length of the line, he and I would have missed our company's dinner meeting. A true test of a hotel's age seems to be its elevator cabins, and yes you can tell this hotel has been there a while. Though in saying that they've made great efforts at keeping things clean. The guestroom was on the average to small side, but my 26th floor room had a door that opened up. Though lacked a balcony. The door just opened to a railing. So it was nice to get some fresh, humid air. The bed was comfortable and had quality linens. The bathroom was functional, but seemed really old. I was not impressed with the shower head. Parking was a pain, and having come back late from dinner their small self park garage was filled to near capacity.

They even moved our rooms to be a little closer together. (They did not have anything adjoining, but at least they got us on the same floor.) Our rooms were a little small, but they were clean and had lovely linens and comfy beds. Both of the rooms had a nice view, but the boys really scored with a view of the cruise ships. I enjoyed being able to sit out on my balcony and do my nails and watch people swimming in the pool while my husband took a quick nap. We ate dinner at the hotel's restaurant.

I can't remember what my younger son ate, but he would have complained - loudly - if it had been bad.

But, we were coming home from a cruise out of the Miami port, and wanted to treat ourselves. We booked online through the Marriott site and my rewards number, finding a package for \"pre or post\" cruisers which included transportation and breakfast. But, just to be sure, I called the hotel a couple of weeks before the trip to find out how they would pick us up at the port (we were first time cruisers). I had to go through two front desk people who didn't understand that we were staying at the end of the cruise and needed to be picked up at the port before I finally got to a customer service rep, named Julisa, and we got it straightened out. It seems most folks use this package when leaving for a cruise rather than at the end. We also had a minor glitch on the rate. Julisa seemed confused about the rate I had booked, but I informed her about the code and where I saw it on the site. I also reminded her nicely that I was a Marriott Rewards member, but could just as easily \"cross the street\" to Hilton or somebody else if there was a problem. She said there were some errors in rate codes on the site, but they would glady honor the rate for what we needed. WIth little hesitation, she was able to get things straighted out, let me know how to get transporation from the port (just call and a bellman picked us up) and she said she would arrange to block a room out so we could check in early since our cruise was returning around 8 a.m. There we no problems when we actually arrived in port on July 27. We called as soon as we had our luggage and we had a limo at the curb within 15 min. The bellman who was driving was very helpful and advised us about a 3 hour city tour if we were interested (we were) and he could help arrange it. Once we arrived, we did learn that the room was not quite ready yet, but were offered breakfast if we wanted. We decided instead to take the city tour at 10 am to give them more to get the room prepared. The bellman offered to store the luggage and said he would take it up to the room when it was ready and he did. When Julisa, who was on duty when we checked in, learned I was there, she came over personally, remembered our phone conversation and made sure everything was they way we wanted. We were very satisfied, up to that point, and then went on to the three hour tour which we recommend if you just want a quick view of Miami (South Beach, Little Havana). But, the best was yet to come. When we came back from the tour and checked in, we kept hearing them refer to our room as a \"suite.\" For whatever reason, we got upgraded from a room to a suite, at no additional charge. My wife commented the bathroom was almost as big as the stateroom on our ship. The suite was complete with a sitting area, a dining table, a mini-fridge as well as a comfy queen size bed. We also took advantage of the hotel's poolside bar/lunch service and relaxed and prepared for our flight home the next delay. As a Marriott member, I was also offered a choice of \"freebies\": one night free internet, one day of parking, or a free movie on pay per view. We chose the movie, and they took it right back off the bill with no problem at check out. The only glitch we had was the keyboard for the internet on tv was not working. But, a quick call to the front desk and the maintaince people were up in a flash and it was repaired ASAP. Also, unlike Fairfield, they don't have a free internet computer in the lobby. They have a business center where you can access the net at .25 a minute and print out pages at $1 each. I guess they figure most of their business comes from people on expense accounts, but we needed to check in for our flight and print boarding passes. Our room was on a high floor, overlooking the bay, so not only did we have a nice room, we had a really great view. I almost regret we didn't have more time to spend in Miami. Without having to go outside, there's a selection of places to eat and pick up a few grocery items next door at the Doubletree. After having dinner at a Chinese fine dining place, we bought some fresh baked desserts and milk to take back to the room and enjoy along with the free movie. The breakfast was good, with a buffet including a variety of hot items. It was nothing fancy, but there was plenty of breakfast meats, eggs, fruits, baked goods, cereal along with juice and coffee. While in the room, I came across a book that I guess Marriott puts in all their rooms with stories about their people and how they make a difference. You can add Julisa to the list. All she had to do was to make sure we had the transporation and the breakfast and of course the room we paid for and we would have been happy.

If we choose to cruise from Miami again, we would include this hotel in our list of options.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Casselberry, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove Love this Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "zProsperity", "ReviewID": "UR6059146", "Content": "Recently stayed here on a trip with some friends from college.

Again, the sandwich was huge and very good. My husband had a breakfast quesadilla he said was also very tasty. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only \"issue\" is that the elevators and escalators could use updating, but I never waited for a elevator because there are plenty.

We chose this hotel because of the location to the Port of Miami as well as reviews submitted to Trip Advisor. The customer service was okay. The help desk was friendly. Our flight was an overnight flight so we checked into the hotel about 12:30 a.m., so it was late at night. Room service closed at 1:00 a.m. but they still let us order and we ordered a chicken wrap sandwich that was so delicious! ($20, expensive, but delicious.) Our room was really tiny, but very clean. Probably the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. We paid about $309, and paid a little extra for a \"deluxe bayview\" room. We did have a spectacular view of Biscayne Bay with a tiny balcony. So we had \"all view with little room.\" The bed was very comfortable so we had a great night sleep. The shower on the other hand was atrocious. Something had happened to the plumbing in our room so the only water choices were \"Hot\" and \"Boiling Hot.\" And there was no water pressure coming out of the showerhead, which probably was good to avoid being scalded. We did call maintenance to come and fix the shower, but they came so late that we had already gotten dressed and we were ready to check out of the hotel when they finally came. After telling this to one of the managers, even though she was very courteous and polite, they still didn't discount the price of the room at all, which we thought was poor customer service. We did enjoy the location of the hotel and walked a short 5 minute walk to the \"Omni Walk\" people mover that travels around downtown Miami. It is a FREE service that transports you to where you want to go in that area. The hotel was very helpful in giving us directions and instructions on how to use, get to, etc. We took the Omni Walk to Bayside Marketplace (which is another 5 minute walk from the Omni Station.) Bayside was alot of fun with great places to eat and lots of places to shop. We even booked a short 1 1/2 hour boat bay cruise at Bayside that takes you to show you \"Millionaire's Row\" where all of the celebrities have their homes in Miami (about $15/person). It was a fun tour and well worth the time and money. Overall, we did like the Miami Marriott. We have always had good experiences at Marriott hotels. The lobby is gorgeous and the hotel is very nice and clean, just like the pictures on Trip Advisor show. You get what you see. And the location of the hotel is in the business district, but right on the bay so you still get the great views. Next time, we'll just ask for a bigger room.

The outdoor pool and hot tub on deck 5 is excellent but the pool is a little small. My only concern was that the 11 o'clock checkout was hectic due to a conference in the hotel and we waited over 30 minutes to get an elevator from the 24th floor.

Since I am a points and miles junkie, I was able to book one night at the Las Vegas Marriott using my points. I had stayed here before and it is an all suites property. For 25,000 Marriott points, it's an ok deal, although for the same amount of points, you can stay at Marriott Grand Chateau near City Center, but it was not available on my date of stay.

Parking is free and you self park in their gated garage. The check-in is smooth. Next to the reception is The Marketplace kiosk for drinks, snacks and toiletries. I had room 1204, which had a strip view. The suite had a separate small bedroom, king bed, small flat panel TV. The living area had sofa, flat panel TV with desk and wet bar and mini refrigerator was under the end table. There was a coffee maker, which I decided to make some hot water for tea and the water had brown scum in it...so gross. If I had made coffee, it would have been disguised and I would have ingested, really a turnoff. Bottled water for purchase in the room. Bathroom had tub/shower combo. No robe and the toiletries were terrible, such a negative. Free Wifi in the room, which was nice. The room was relatively clean as was the hotel common areas. Closet and in room safe. I had to heat up some food and they let me use the \"staff\" breakroom microwave. Pay for View movies in room, business center with printer, copier. Vending machines on the floor. Las Vegas monorail is one block away and runs 6 am to 2 am. The airport shuttle is $7.00 each way to the strip. Walgreens at the corner on the strip, although in the burning heat of summer, it wouldn't be a fun walk. Amenities include 24 hour Fitness Center with lifecycle, stair master, treadmill. There is a small pool and whirlpool, not much to write home about. The room service breakfast is $19 for American Breakfast with 20% service charge and sales tax. The lobby bar is off the reception and restaurant beyond that. They have free cold water and apples in the lobby.

As a Marriott Platinum Lifetime elite member I have stayed at over 150 Marriott locations, and that includes those properties that are all suites. This Marriott is an excellent one. The hotel has just completed a full renovation of its lobby and restaurant area. It appears to be both a love or hate proposition, but is somewhat of an improvement despite the fact that the restaurant space has given way to more bar, and community tables. The rooms also need renovation, which I understand is slated for next year, but nonetheless the rooms are clean and well maintained by an excellent housekeeping staff. In fact, I can honestly say that the entire staff of the hotel, from the servers and restaurant managers like Manny, Scott, Winnie, Gloria and Justine, to the desk staff like Kathy, Kit and Junior and Manager Jonathan, and the housekeepers Camarina, Gloria, and Supervisor Nancy, are all some of the best group of Marriott employees we have encountered in 25 years. By the way, parking is also complimentary, and all parking spots are very accessible to the hotel lobby. When we return to Las Vegas this will be our home away from home. That is not only because of the above, but also it is a property that is detached from the smoke, gambling, and crowded atmosphere on the Strip. That entertainment is literally around the block, but its sure nice to be able to sit at a bar, in a smoke free atmosphere, and enjoy the peace and quiet of a real hotel atmosphere.

There are many pluses and minuses of this property. PLUSES: 1. Location: Behind the Wynn and across the street from the Las Vegas Hilton makes it an easy walk towards the north end of the strip. 2. All suites: These are all suites and very comfortable but also tiny in size. They each have two televisions (not flat screen, so out-dated) and french doors that separate the living room from bedroom. The doors only have lace curtains, so if you are booking this to have privacy, forget that idea! Minuses: 1. Location is difficult to get to airport after stay (they do not have a shuttle to strip either). Cab fare is about $18.00 one way. If you are bidding on Priceline, you may want to spend a little more and try to get a hotel on the strip if you are looking into this property. Find out what hotels you may end up with at www.biddingfortravel.com. 2. The suites are a bit small and do not have flat-screen televisions. 3. Fitness Center is really limited 4. Lobby and all is small. It feels more like a 3 star hotel, rather than 3.5 star. Overall, I had a couple of problems with the stay but the staff was decet about it. I would recommend this property if you get a deal, otherwise, stay at the strip. If you are debating this over the Hilton across the street, I would go with this one. It is nicer and smaller (less hectic). I paid $62 + tax on Priceline for a 3.5 star hotel by the way. It was selling online for $199 + tax (which is rather crazy high I think for this type of hotel).

The hotel features sufficient parking, most behind a security bar. Next door, we had a quite good formal dinner at Piero's--much like the remnants of the Rat Pack days with a strong Italian vein and superior wait service. If you're looking for an oversized pool, book elsewhere. For us, it was more family and friends catch up time elsewhere, so fun in the sun was not an issue and the smaller, quiet pool was satisfactory for a couple hours. The hotel has an early check in link with our Alaska flight, complete with printed boarding passes. Ask about other air carriers if of interest. Also, there's a business center on site. I recommend that unless you know your way around well, that you bring printed directions from Mapquest or simlar source from the Rent a Car center which is not at the Airport.

As a woman traveling alone, I usually find Marriotts are good hotels for me. The rooms are all compact suites, with separate very small living rooms. Small refrigerator, sink, coffee maker setup, and nice desk in the living room. Comfy bed with too many pillows and a big comforter (to use in the air conditioning?) - better than too few pillows, though. Good points: * Easy walk to the main convention center (although if that's why you're staying there, the Marriott Courtyard is much closer). * Easy walk to the Monorail so you can get to the casinos and other attractions easily. * Quiet, not smoky, no slot machines (etc.), and not really a \"Vegas, Baby!\" kind of place * ATM in the lobby when you need cash (small fee, of course) * Small bar and restaurant in the lobby. Small disappointments: * Extra charge for Internet connection * VERY short ethernet cable for the Internet connection (found hanging in a small bag in the closet), required that you stay seated at the desk. As long as I was paying anyway, wireless would have been preferable so I could have been sitting on the couch if I felt like it. * No in-room safe. * No airport shuttle. (the cab was $15 w/tip) * No concierge. * No cabs on site (the cabs work for the casinos i Vegas), but the door man didn't seem to have trouble flagging one down when a guest needed one (but the weather was good and none of the giant conventions was happening during my visit). * Bathroom towel bars not in logical locations for someone using the shower I met friends for breakfast at the MGM Grand every day, taking the Monorail to meet them at 7 a.m. NO ONE was in the Monorail stations or on the train itself as I traveled to the MGM Grand. Apparently no one in the city starts work that early. Boston, NYC, etc. would have been hopping at 7 a.m. A little weird...

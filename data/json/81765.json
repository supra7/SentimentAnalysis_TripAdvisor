Reallly worth it. (Though I miss their cook to order eggs, I understand as prices are going up for everything.) It's so great to be so close to the pier, have pleasant and speedy service, wonderful accomodations (nice ammenities-comfortable bed with ample pillows, an aroma therapy sleep kit, that nice rounded shower rod that keeps your curtain clinging the tub and not you, nice little soaps and lotions to use so you don't have to unpack yours if you don't want.) and so far we always got a room with a view of the harbor lights at night and then a view of our cruise ship the next morning. Another benefit of the location, is that there's a Rite Aid a few blocks up if you need to pick up something you forgot before setting sail (I believe that is Gaffey St). Also, several fast food places if you want to eat there or bring it back to the comfort of your room at night.

I had booked a suite for three adults (king bed & sleep sofa) online 11 months prior to check-in; top priority was a view of the harbor so we could see our ship arrive in the morning. Our room rate of $208 (plus $20 extra for 3rd adult AND taxes) came to a total of about $258 and was paid, non-refundable, at the time of booking. We were a little intimidated as our ride (ExecuCar) took us through San Pedro at dusk. We received a very pleasant greeting from the front desk and the lobby made a nice impression. Our driver loaded our luggage onto the cart in the absence of bell services. As we wheeled cart to elevator, bellman showed up and took over. The living area of the suite was very small and furnishings seemed quite basic. The bedroom was much more spacious and very nice. King bed was very comfortable and had nice linens. Best of all was the large window that wrapped around the corner offering a great view. Bathroom was smaller than expected, but perfectly comfortable although did have signs of wear. Desktop was spacious, but we could not find any sign of WiFi or internet connection (apparently they did have it and we should have called). We had a bar sink and coffee maker by the entry door. So we settled into the room, then proceeded to San Pedro Brewing Co for dinner. Since Blu (in-house restaurant) was not honoring their own Restaurant.com certificates, we opted to go elsewhere for breakfast, too. During daylight, we loved all the little storefronts and the farmer's market (Fridays). My frustration with our stay is that we booked a room for three adults and paid for the additional person (almost a year in advance). But our room was prepared for only two. We did have a sleep sofa, but no pillows; we called for some but they \"were out\" of them. Housekeeping did bring extra blankets (also not in the room). Our coffee maker two cups and supplies for one cup of regular and one cup of decaf (front desk did provide additional). Our room had only two glasses. Even when booking a suite, the Crowne Plaza offers shuttle to cruise terminal on a first-come, first served basis.

I generally book my clients at the Doubletree in this area, (I specialize in Disney Cruises) and was looking forward to staying here to see if I would be willing to recommend this property also. I was pleased with my stay. As an agent you try to look at things from all kinds of perspectives, and I also talk to many other guests as I am out and about looking at the property. I also visit with as many staff members as I can. The good - As far as a park & cruise hotel, this property has a perfect location. It is extremely close to the pier. Depending on your room location, you can watch the ships sail in and out (neat!) Our room was perfectly clean. The beds were comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly, as was the bell staff, and the valet staff. The complimentary glasses of wine were a nice touch. We arrived early, and our room was ready. Everything went very smooth. The mediocre- We found it slightly inconvenient that to get to our car we had to have the valet bring it every time. We were a bit spazzy in that we needed to put more things in the car/overnight bag, and get other things out as we prepared to sail out the next day. This meant we had to have them get the car (and tipped them) 3 times. It would have been great if the lot had been easily accessible to us just so we could get in and out of our trunk without involving valet, but overall, not a big deal, just a statement really, and had we thought things through better, this wouldn't have been an issue. The less than great - the pool water was absolutely freezing (mind you, it was November). I noticed a middle age couple in the lobby that looked a bit frazzled and I started up a conversation with them. They were frustrated with the front desk staff because they were wanting a shuttle ride to somewhere nearby, and were told no. They countered that the website said they provided shuttle rides within a few mile radius, but the customers said the front desk staff had told them that was wrong, and that they should have been looking at the local website rather than the national one. At that point they were showing me on their phone what the Crowne Plaza website said, and the gentlemen from the concierge was agreeing that they were right, and as I left, I felt secure he was going to take care of the guest. The buffet the next morning was our least favorite thing about the stay. Although we had 4 guests, we received 2 vouchers for the buffet. We arrived about 5 minutes after they opened. There were only a handful of things out on the buffet, most of the hot items were cold (odd, I know), almost like they were warming them up from the day before?? By the time we paid our bill, they were still putting things out for the buffet, so we didn't get to have the majority of the things that were offered due to how late they were at getting them out. Our gentleman waiter was really, really out of it. He commented about being out too late the night before, and I am very nearly certain he was quite hung over. He only came by our tale 2 additional times, and spent most of his time giggling with a female employee off to the side. All in all, our breakfast was a bust, but that was my biggest complaint about the property, and it really has nothing to do with the room. I thought the price was moderate to high, but comparable to the other prices in the area for a stay and cruise rate.

Our room was was fine, clean, but there were few of the gadgets you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find elsewhere inside your room. Normally when we travel we use Super 8, and always get a large fridge, for instance, and a coffee machine \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not here \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and you pay for the use of the Internet, and then it was somewhat dodgy and kept dropping out, which was a pain since I lug my laptop along only because I actually have to do some work on it, not just for fun. We were there in October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was cool out (we come from Arizona) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the lobby was cooled down to freezing (well, almost). Fortunately the AC could be turned off in the room. The view from the room was sensational, right across the harbor, cruise and container terminals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had the good luck to see one of those massive floating-town cruise ships berthed and got to watch it sail. The location of the hotel is great, just a block or two from the shore and close to the cruise terminals, if that I your destination. And it was a less than ten minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk to the local version of the fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wharf where you can find a whole row of restaurants/shops offering fresh seafood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually, some of it can be bought alive (lobster). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvillage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with touristy shops. The restaurant in the hotel was good, too. Staff was exceedingly friendly and accommodating and helpful, also in view of our pre-marathon special requirements. We were also told that we could register at a counter in the lobby for free transportation to the start of the marathon, and you could choose different times to get there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and back, which sounded like great service. That proved a bit tricky. First, there was nobody there, then the next guy didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the registration lists and told us to come back later. We did that and that guy in turn took a note \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lists still absent, and that was the late after noon before the marathon. I think it was the fourth time or so of my going back before I was actually reasonably sure we were registered for transport. On the morning of the marathon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, it was VERY early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c special small breakfast had been set out for the marathon runners. That was nice and much appreciated. And the vans to take us there were there as promised, and left almost on time. What was a real shambles was that our driver had absolutely no clue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as we found out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where he was taking us apart from the general vicinity. He was just told to follow the van ahead of him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which he promptly lost of course at a red light. After some useless driving around and getting stuck in a line while heading up the ramp of a multilevel parking lot (I thought that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the smartest) move, one of the other runners in the van finally told him to just stop, since she recognized from an earlier year that we were very close, and we just walked the rest of the way. That was not what you need before a marathon, knowing there will be endless crowds and you really want to get to the starting line in time. We were also booked for the return trip, but since we now couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sure where exactly the pick-up point was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c same as the proper drop-out, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never seen that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we opted to take a taxi back.

We drove down from the Bay Area the night before, and just needed a convenient place to stay for one night. Check In and Front Desk: Check in was handled promptly and extremely courteously. Its possible that I've never met a friendlier front desk clerk. We had booked a room with 1 king bed, not thinking that we'd need two, since it was us and our kids. When we realized this in our first room, I called down to the desk, and within 10 minutes, a hotel employee arrived with a key to our new room, with two double beds. There was a nominal price increase for the room, which didn't bother me a bit. Lobby: The lobby was a little dated looking, other than that, fairly unremarkable. Room: The room was clean. It was a fairly small room, however. If you are taking a cruise, many rooms will have views of the ships. Be sure to ask and they might be able to get a good room for you. It was really fun for the kids (and me) to watch the Disney Wonder docking a few hours before we boarded. Other rooms will have a view of the ship as it approaches. Restaurant: After reading several negative reviews of the restaurant, we swore we wouldn't eat there. However, by the time we got to San Pedro, we were tired and hungry, and couldn't find a place to park near some of the higher rated restaurants. We didn't feel like hunting around anymore, and it was also fairly cold and windy out, so we ruled out parking at the hotel and walking. So, we made the decision to eat in the hotel. The restaurant was fine. I might have been disappointed if I had actually gone out of my way to seek that restaurant out, but considering we could just ride down in the elevator, eat and ride back up to our room, it served its purpose just fine. The food was a little overpriced, and fairly plain, but the service really shined. Our server was really friendly, and when my daughter complained about having parmesan cheese on her spaghetti (before we had a chance to tell her to just deal with it) he insisted on taking it back and bringing a fresh one. Honestly, the great service made up for the average food. We also had breakfast on the morning we left. It was a fairly expensive breakfast buffet, but the food was all good. The omelette server was really friendly. It inspired another guest to remark \"best omelette I've had all week!\" I certainly was in agreement. Location: The location is the primary reason we chose the hotel. It was about 5 minutes or less to the World Cruise Center, where the Disney Cruise departed from. The hotel does run a shuttle to the cruise center, but we had our car, and had planned on parking at the Cruise Center itself. The hotel is located on one of the main streets in San Pedro near some shops and restaurants. It was really quiet, but there were some slightly odd people walking around the neighborhood, which was another reason we decided to just stay in for dinner. Parking: The hotel offers complimentary self parking, which we used. The underground lot is really old and involves some touchy navigation if you drive a mega SUV like me. Actually, there were barely any spaces left when we arrived. They do offer valet parking as well. I had considered a \"stay and park\" package, but calculated it would cost around $30 less to just park at the World Cruise Center. I didn't anticipate eating breakfast at the hotel, and I think the package included breakfast. So, when we got breakfast, I think we ended up even with the stay and park package. On the other hand, if you do that, you'd need a shuttle back to the hotel, which would just increase the time and number of steps before you are back on the road. Its something to consider, however. Overall, I we had a perfectly good stay at the Crowne Plaza Los Angeles Harbor. The service really stood out, and for me showed how that can make up for other areas where a hotel might be lacking slightly.

If you book through Priceline, you will be put in a room that used to be smoking & has supposedly been cleaned but there was still a strong smell of smoke. As an ex-smoker, I found that a little disturbing but they would only move us to another \"ex-smoking\" room. The one good thing about that room is that it's on a lower floor that does have hot water for the shower. Everyone we talked to above the 4th floor didn't have hot water. So, that appears to be the norm in this hotel. Suggest you ask for a room on a lower floor. The restaurant was supposed to open at 7:00 in the morning but didn't open until nearly 7:30 & then they took another 20-25 minutes before they had all the buffet food out . This is defintely not a typical Crowne Plaza but even the staff admitted that is was only built for the cruise passengers. Although I was not overly impressed with the hotel, if you can get it at a good price & you're going on a cruise, it certainly is the best bet in San Pedro. You can even leave your car there.

The hotel was busy with wedding guests as well as cruisers for more than 4 ships that sailed away that weekend. Upon early arrival (before noon) we were allowed to check-in and were upgraded to the 10 Concereige Floor. Also my friend who only spent one night where also upgraded and all of us were given complimentary vouchers for a wonderful buffet breakfast in their dining room Our rooms were roomy with all of the normal hotel amenities. I know there was a pool, but the outside climate that weekend did not allow us to check out this area. In the lobby, guests were offered two chilled beverages each day. Bell and conceriege staff where nearby to offer assistance and advice on places to dine and see. We tried Whale & Ale on Saturday night, just about a 2 block's away. It had wonderful pub atmosphere and folk style entertainment that evening. For a night-cap, we stopped into the hotel bar. Our waitress was so conginial and efficient. We shared a lot of laughs. The complimentary hotel to pier shuttle seemed to run efficiently. There were two signs near the lobby doors indicating which side to line up for which ship. Our wait was only about 20 minutes.

While the ship itself really has not been well-maintained, i.e. stained carpets, mildew smell in certain areas, paint chipped from walls, scrapes and marks on walls, and a basic look of a once-beautiful ship just kept for tours, it does offer a fun and engaging look at the ghosts and legends that make up her history. We opted for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Haunted Encounters Passport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which entitled us to the self-guided tour (beware that if you are not good with directions, your feet will become weary from losing your way in the bowels of the ship), the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghosts and Legends\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tour and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Haunted Encounters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tour for a cost of $27.95 per person. The fee was well worth the tours of areas not open to the public for general browsing, as we were exposed to a doorway where a crew member had been crushed and has been known to still visit the space, the boiler room where a young girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spirit visits on occasion, and various cabins where passengers had died \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come back to life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over the course of Queen Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life on the seas. Dedicate 3-4 hours to ensure you have time to join in the guided tours as they do fill up fast! Once back to the Crowne Plaza, we asked the concierge for a good recommendation for dinner. He made no hesitation in recommending Raffaello\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ristorante in San Pedro. The valet drove us in a complimentary hotel van to dinner, where we were promptly seated simply by mentioning the name of our concierge (though we had no reservations and the place was packed!). The Italian food was very, very good with the mozzarella sticks being the table favorite!

None of us finished our huge meals, probably because the chef sent us a couple of appetizers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the house\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After the meal, we ventured back to the Crowne Plaza, only a 4 block walk. The morning of disembarkation, we leisurely made our way to the lobby where we caught the Crowne Plaza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free cruise shuttle just before noon (the shuttle actually begins at 10:30 a.m.) and arrived to the port by 12:05 p.m. As easy as pie.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs", "Title": "\u201cNice Pre-Cruise Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BethMD", "ReviewID": "UR22819745", "Content": "Very handy to the ship terminal.

Unfortunately, mostly as a result of multiple Priceline reservations, I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occassions and have learned that competent service only occurs by accident. I have asked several front desk staffers what they think the hotel guest expects and NONE of them could offer any response to indicate they know we (guests) are only seeking to get from Point A (the reception desk) to Point B (a room with clean sheets a working bathroom and HBO) as QUICKLY as possible. I have received the wrong room key (someone was already checked in) on two occassions and, one evening I was fortunate enough to return to the front desk twice (with luggage in hand) twice in the SAME night because I was given non-working keys.

Before I was checked in, I had to call the Holiday Inn 800# and Priceline customer service. Although I was able to show a confirmed and pre-paid Priceline reservation (complete with printed receipt and confirmation number, the two front desk clerks were unable to provide a room because they claimed \"The hotel hadn't been paid for my reservation.\" It took almost three (yes, 3) hours to check me in. (I was told one of the clerks was fired the next day but the problem clearly rests with the franchise owner and the manager.) The manager was unwilling to speak with me when I wanted to discuss the situation the next day. The hotel reluctantly offered me 30,000 points on the Priority rewards program - an amount which barely covers one night at ANOTHER Crown Plaza.

I won the hotel with a $65 bid on Priceline, which seems to be a standard winning price at this property. I called a week ahead of time to see about requesting a room with two beds as I was traveling with my mother, and was told by the reservations person at the hotel that I had a king room and that if I didn't like it, I'd have to take it up with Priceline. I\"m used to being denied this type of request befroe check-in, but the usual response is that a note will be made on the reservation in case a desired room was available. Not so here, and I felt it was handled a little poorly, but figured I might have better luck upon check-in. We caught an early, direct flight out of Indianapolis to LAX, and with the time change, we actually arrived at 8:30 AM. I had arranged a SuperShuttle to take us to the hotel ($17/pp), and we were dropped off around 10 AM. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and not only gave use a room with two beds, but also let us check in 5 hours early. I appreciated this, and we headed up to our room on the fifth floor. As per usual with a Priceline room, it was located at the end of the hall, but for the savings and the quietness that provides ... who cares? The room itself was very clean, though missing a few things (some of the sleep ammenities promised, a second coffee mug, etc), but we got these from a housekeeper we saw around. I was disappointed though that the wireless internet service was down and that the TV was getting horrible reception. The internet eventually started working ($10/day) and I figured out that I could get a good TV signal if I twisted the cord in back until it came through clearly. We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and it was fine, though the food was nothing great and the service was pretty slow. The pool is a small outside one, along with a hot tub, and the exercise room consists of a treadmill, an elliptical, a few recumbent bikes, and various weight machines. I was slightly perturbed by the fact that there were no cleaning supplies in they gym as they had obviously run out a while ago and simply had not been replaced. We decided to get out of the room and walk around San Pedro. It was a Sunday afternoon and was very quiet. You can tell there is some neighborhood rejuvenation going on because of all of the places being ripped up and turned into apartments and condos. Within a few blocks of the hotel in each direction it seemed like a nice area, and then after that, buildings started deteriorating. There was a grocery/liquor store east of the hotel a block or two, but it looked a little scary to me. There are also a lot of shops and restaurants the opposite direction along the harbor. Later in the day, we headed towards the harbor and ate at a Mexican restaurant called The Green Onion. Prices were decent and the food was very good, though my mom later thought that the food didn't agree with her. The next morning we went to the Pacific Cafe, across the street from the hotel (exiting through the restaurant door). This was a nice little place that was seemingly run by a single lady, and I was able to get a ham/cheese omelet with two slices of sourdough toast for $3.95. The food was quite decent and the price could not be beat ... I'd definitely recommend this place over a chain like Starbucks (which is just down the block on the same side of the street as the hotel). The Crowne Plaza offered a free shuttle to the port starting at 10:30. We went down at about 10:45, climbed aboard, and were the only ones taken over to the ship. This shuttle picks up from the port, and it will also take people to a local mall and supposedly other places within a 5-mile radius. I asked about being taken to an In-N-Out Burger and was told \"maybe later\" that really seemed to be a \"no\" even though it was 3 miles away.

We flew in from the East Coast and arrived at the hotel about 9ish pm local time. We used Go Sedan for our transfers and they were wonderful. They met us in baggage claim and took us straight to the bellman at the hotel. Great service! Initially, we requested a non-smoking king room. When I called the day of check in to confirm, they had me down for a smoking double. I again requested non-smoking king. When we checked in, I asked again. They said they had non-smoking but no kings. Then the clerk offered a handicapped non-smoking king which we were happy to take. Check in was very quick and easy. We used Priceline for our room. The desk clerk wasn't super friendly, but was quick, efficient and friendly enough. We checked in at the bell desk and they recommeded some places to eat nearby and provided a map for us. We ended up at the Green Onion, a Mexican restaurant almost right next door. The food and service were great. It was casual and reasonably priced. Perfect for weary travelers! The decor was a little different - almost like a Bennigan's. They had a bar. Our hotel room had a big chair and a desk. We didn't have a great view. The room was very clean, but a little worn. The shower was a little dark with decent water pressure. The bed was very comfortable. The room temperature was good. They even provided a clip to place on the curtains to keep them closed and keep the room dark. My only complaint about the hotel would be the thin walls. There was a very loud, rude family next door to us making ton of noise at 6am. We could hear almost every word they were saying (more like shouting). But you can't really fault the hotel for the behavior of obnoxious people. We didn't call and complain because we were ready to get up anyway. The next morning we went for a walk up 6th street I think - headed away from the port. We walked for a few blocks. At one of the main intersections, caddy corner to a thift store, we found the funky little San Pedro Deli and Cafe. What a great place to eat breakfast. The menu was varied. The service and the food were awesome. It was a great way to start our vacation. Plus it was a great value for the money. They give you a ton of food. I had 4 slices of french toast, 2 eggs and bacon for $4.99. My husband had an omelette, fried potatoes and buscuits and gravy for $7.59. It was much cheaper that eating at the hotel, and it was nice to experience some local flavor. We also passed several other lunch/dinner restaurants as well as a local coffee shop and a Starbucks. We saw a sign for a liquor store, but it looked like it was closed down. We also saw a wine shop, but it wasn't open yet. I did not see a drug store near the hotel but we didn't ask about one either. The hotel had a gift shop, bar, restaurant, pool and hot tub that we did not use. When we checked in, we asked about the port shuttle and they gave us a paper with the information. They provide service to LA port in San Pedro and to Long Beach for Carnival Cruises. Check out was a breeze - we did express check out over the phone. We carried our own luggage down and were on the first shuttle at 10:30. There were only three of us on the shuttle. The ride was only 5-10 minutes tops. They also provide return shuttle service to the hotel, but we didn't use that service. All in all, it was a great place to stay before our cruise.

The Staff All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful particularly the concierge staff who had advice on things to do and places to eat locally, which added to the flavour of our stay. The Hotel On arrival the foyer was largish, light, well furnished and gave the impression of comfort and made us feel like we would enjoy our stay. There is a small shop selling snacks, drink - including milk, suntan lotion and other items at reasonable prices. The lifts were of reasonable size and opened onto wide, well lit and clean corridor to our room. The first impression of our room was large, tasteful d\u00c3\u00a9cor, clean and comfortable. Two large double beds, two arm chairs, foot stall, desk and TV etc. The bathroom was also clean and well presented. Two gripes. The first being that there were only one creamer and sugar by the coffee maker. Second, the air-conditioning didn't sound too bad during the day, but was a bit noisy at night. A fridge would have been nice, but there is an ice bucket and we found an ice machine on one of the floors. Although the hotel is situated on the corner of two side roads there is little traffic and we heard no noise in our room. We used the hotel restaurant only once and found the food reasonable and the prices moderate to high. We were not impressed with the service however. There is a pleasant outside area next to the restaurant with tables, chairs and umbrellas where you can sit for a meal or take drinks from the bar. The gated pool and surrounding area, which included a jacuzzi, loungers, tables with umbrellas and chairs, are clean and well presented. Although this area is situated next to a road, the pool area is higher than the road, which is unnoticeable, and we didn't notice any disturbing noise. There are also fresh towels proved in a container by the pool. A pleasant area to lounge and enjoy the weather or read a book. If you are going to the pool remember to take your room card, as you will need this to gain access. The hotel free shuttle to the port of LA is about a twenty minute ride away so is great value. Would definitely stay here again. The surrounding area There are a number of eating places within a block or two ranging from snack bars to small restaurants at reasonable prices. Further afield, near the water, there are sea food bars and more restaurants. However, some of these are a mile or so away, so you may want to take a car or bus. There is a bus stop across the road from the hotel and I thought I saw a bus go from there down towards the water and the sea food bars. Ask the concierge I'm sure he would know. Shopping in the immediate area is virtually non-existent so take the hotel shuttle to the mall. We felt safe walking the area during the day but did not go out after dark so cannot comment. We discovered a film being made a block from the hotel and spent a pleasant hour watching take after take. The film was going to be part animated so watching actors reacting to something that wasn't there was quite hilarious. Los Angeles Airport to Crowne Plaza We read somewhere that the journey from LAX to The Crowne Plaza should take about 45 minutes, but at certain times of the day, rush hour for example, the journey can take up to two hours. So with this in mind we pre-booked a car with Prime Time to meet us at LAX. The cost is not much more than a taxi (based on a 45 minute journey time) and included the tip. We were two hours late getting into LAX and also had to wait some time for our bags, so were a bit worried about the meet. However, our fears were dashed when we arrived out in the concourse to see our name being displayed by the driver - brilliant!!!", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cCrown was just fine!\u201d", "Author": "Tom43302", "ReviewID": "UR10799063", "Content": "The Crown Plaza was very nice!

The restaurant one block up that the bellman recommended is really worth writing about. Pappadokas...of football fame. It is an old family owned greek place. The owner (the father of the football giants) is a smooth character full of charm. He was half the fun. The food was fabulous. The entertainment even better. The owner and one of the waiters started dancing, the music was great. The belly dancer part was a little tasteless, but she was very pretty. The former manager of the Dodgers was there, another family celebrating grandpa's 97th birthday, a USC student celebrating the running of her first marathon. It's was a lot of fun. I will go back to the Crowne to sleep in that bed and eat at that restaurant.

We were to stay at the hotel from a Thurs night until Mon morning the following week when we were to get on a cruise to get married. On our second day at the hotel, we left the room to go get lunch. As we walked out of the room, the housekeeper was cleaning the room next to ours, so we put our sign on the door to clean our room. We shut the door and I smiled at the housekeeper as we left. When we returned back to our room 3 1/2 hours later, the housekeeper had cleaned the room. However, all of our luggage had been gone through....there were things on the floor from our suitcases that weren't out of the suitcase before we left. Our laptop was stolen and so was a folder that contained all of our documents needed to get married and get on the cruise...to include our birth certificates of mine and my husbands and my 5-yr old daughters. We immediately contacted the manger and filed a report with the hotel and the LA Police Dept. It has now been a week and a half and we still have not been able to track down who took our stuff. The security that works at the hotel has not looked at the security tapes and they refuse to give me the name of the housekeeper who cleaned our room. To make matters worse, the manager of the hotel gave us a bucket of 6 beers and a free dinner at their restaraunt since it was \"the least we can do\". Come to find out, the housekeeper didn't speak English and had just started at the hotel. So, a case of stolen identity? I think so. Horrible customer service at this hotel. They don't take in account the huge impact this will have on our lives with us not knowing whether or not someone is using our names and worse, our social security numbers for their own personal gain.

The lobby had a design board showing new furnishings planned for an upcoming redesign of the lobby. Overall, it felt like a place that was being well cared-for.

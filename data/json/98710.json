The room was way beyond my expectations as was as good as some 5 star hotels. There's a pool on the roof and a small fitness room too. If you have a room facing towards the city the view at night is a sight worth seeing. You'll easily pay double for a room like this if you stay downtown and then you don't get the bonus of free parking. The hotel isn't far from town, it only took us 15 minutes to drive from the hotel to downtown. Not walkable (you're in Texas after all!), but not a problem being that bit further away for the money you've saved. My only criticism is the price of the food, especially for breakfast. Don't get me wrong, the food really was great - we had dinner here a couple of times and all the food we had was really good. You'll definitely find better value if you venture to a restaurant. And the hotel staff are knowledgable about places to eat in Dallas. The hotel breakfast, although good, is way overpriced (the buffet is anyway) - and I don't think this was worth the money we paid. If you do stay here, when you book (direct via their website) you can give a preference of floor location (low or high). Definitely select a high level - if you're on the city side you'll get the view.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cTry this business-class hotel for a weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "WorldwidetravelerUsa", "ReviewID": "UR127881721", "Content": "We've stayed twice at this Renaissance on Marriott weekend rates and it has been a great value each time.

While it may not be the highest of caliber, I expect a bit more than the average Holiday Inn or the like. With that said....Renaissance was average when you think of what it should be or what you should expect. I stayed only one night, while in Dallas for the 2012 Auto Show. I will point out that when you search for Downtown Dallas Hotels, this one comes up. It is not IN downtown, but it is in Market Center, which is about a 4 or 5 minute drive from actual Downtown. Overall, The hotel was clean and customer service was adequate. I have to point out that I have no serious concerns nor any \"real\" complaints. But I have a couple gripes about the general stay, as follows: I am a Marriott Rewards Gold Elite Member...I checked into a King Room on a requested high floor. I was placed on the 19th of 30 floors. That was good for me. However, the room was a connecting room...which I despise. I called down, requesting a non-connecting room. After a quick check, I was informed that there were no non-connecting rooms equal to the room I have. As a Rewards Member, who has stayed at Marriotts over 30 nights a year for the last 2 years...I expected an offer for an upgrade or the like...nothing of that nature came. The agent was nice about it, but nothing could be done. I'm not trying to be \"high and mighty\" but it seemed an easy request for a long time customer. A second concern....the rooftop pool. In order to get there, you travel by elevator to the 30th floor. Then you walk to a stairwell door. Beyond the door you enter a very utilitarian stairwell....black metal stairs, with cream-colored walls...that lead you up to the gym and pool area. This was not fitting with the hotel at all. Frankly I was shocked at the route. Why have they not changed this?? Weird to me. But...the pool area was nice, heated pool was a good extra. Finally, when going into downtown, I searched and then asked if there was car or shuttle service to downtown...there was none. I would even consider paying a bit for the service, but nothing offered. I asked a doorman, who quickly said \"no\". A cab is about $10 each way. Overall, the hotel was very clean, the room was good size and clean. The bathroom had 2 sinks, one inside the bathroom, and one outside....so this was a good bonus. The shower seemed ill fitted for the space....not sure what it was, but it seemed out of place. Otherwise, good, Aveda products, nice, clean appointments. I had no REAL problems and if someone wanted to stay there, I would not discourage them. However, I think I would suggest others before I suggested this one. With the likes of Adolphus, Hilton, and Magnolia within a couple miles...and prices that are not much more, I would think Renaissance would step up the \"details\".", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clearwater, Florida", "Title": "\u201cUpdated Rooms, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "WorldTravelRod", "ReviewID": "UR126422510", "Content": "One of the easiest hotels to find in Dallas, right off I35 near AA Center and Victory Plaza.

I am retired from selling Medical Devices for the past 30 years and spent much of my time on the road. (Sometimes upwards of twenty days a month) That being said I think I know what makes a good hotel stay for both the business traveler or someone traveling for personal issues. We chose the Renaissance only because it was located very close to the Children's Hospital where our Granddaughter was going to be staying. I usually stayed at Hiltons when I was still working but this came highly recommended so I decided to give it a shot. Boy am I glad we stayed there! The very first day when we arrived I was given access to the 27th floor that is reserved for Gold and Elite members. I was also given access to the Gold/Eilte Members Lounge which was a Godsend! The first night we arrived we decided to stop by for a quick drink to relax after a long day of traveling. We were the only ones there as it was a very slow night and struck up a conversation with a Ms Erin Dowell. She was so incredibly sweet and great to talk to. We told her why we were there and what our Granddaughter was going to be going through. From that moment on Erin made sure that all of our needs were met and attended to. Every morning or evening she would check in with us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and if she could help us in any other way. She even helped my wife with a few things on her own time to help us acclimate to being away from home for so long. I honestly do not think we would have kept our sanity during this very trying time had Erin not been there to help us. From now on I will make sure to always stay at the Marriot family of hotels. I used to be a loyal Hilton customer but Erin has shown me what true customer service and attention to detail is all about. I cannot thank Erin and the rest of the Renaissance Dallas staff enough for helping us through probably the most difficult time in our lives. Thankfully our Granddaughter is doing great and has made a full recovery. We will be coming back to Dallas often to visit and play with her as often as possible. We will also be coming back to stay at the Renaissance Dallas Hotel to visit the staff that treated us as family during this very difficult experience.

Now, the third, and most recent visit ... we had a multi-purpose reason for this trip ... part medical visits & some pleasure (Dallas Cowboy game!). Our room was on the 16th floor with a GREAT view of downtown Dallas. The room was larger than our last one, which I was thankful for, since we had four nights booked, instead of one. We really didn't have a lot of pressing things to do each morning, so we put our \"privacy\" sign on the door & we never even heard housekeeping, even though I know they were cleaning rooms around us. Our room was always neat & tidy when we arrived back at the hotel each evening. One of the evenings, my husband wanted some milk. Sadly, even the little hotel \"store\" did not have any in the refrigerator case. As we were walking toward the elevators, one of the staff noticed we had walked out of the store area & asked if he could help us with anything. To which my husband replied, \"Where can I get some milk?\" I was figuring he was going to suggest that we go to the hotel restaurant and ask, but instead, he asked us to wait a moment. When he returned, he was carrying 5 cartons of milk!! Wow! That was awesome & it lasted my husband the entire stay! Everyone we encountered was very friendly and willing to assist.

However, of all the features of the Renaissance, the best by far is the Asador Restaurant. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing! I ended up eating all meals in Dallas right there during my weekend visit, because the odds were long against anywhere else matching the food offerings and ambiance of the Asador. The breakfast buffet featured both a fruit bar and a hot bar, and the chef could fix an omelet or anything else you requested. The fruit was so fresh and varied that choices seemed unlimited.

Our room on the 16th floor had a beautiful view of the downtown Dallas skyline. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were luxurious. The room had a 37\" flat screen TV with lots of channels. A mini-fridge and a safe were available in the room. Coffe/tea was also available. The bathroom amenities included Aveda products. There were 2 sinks in the room--one in the bathroom and one outside the bathroom. We went to the roof to see the pool, whirlpool, and fitness center, but didn't have time to use them. It appeared that the pool was a lap pool. Parking is complimentary and there were lots of spaces available. There is a charge for valet parking.

Very helpful as we were 2 women sharing the suite. Up on the top level was the swimming pool, smallish, and a little scary up so high if you have a fear of heights. Washer and dryer on that level also, as well as fitness room. The best thing at the hotel was the restaurant, Asador, on the main level, featuring many locally produced foods. Food was reasonably priced and it was never too crowded. Breakfast was a buffet, but a little pricey at $18.95. I am a small eater, so I don't think I'd ever eat that much breakfast! My only beef with the hotel is the music playing EVERYWHERE. In the lobby, in the restaurant, outside the building, in all the main hallways. And it is loud. Loud enough that it is hard to carry on a conversation. Staff said they had no means to lower the volume.

They recently renovated the main areas and restaurant/bar for the Super bowl last year and they did a great job, (although you will see an increase in the rates you used to pay in the past). Previously, I avoided their restaurant and opted for the taxi to dinner option. But since their renovation, their new menu is great. They stick with as much organic and local farmers as possible. Even though I get breakfast free in the Concierge club, I opted for paying for the wild boar breakfast tacos (YUM) and the oatmeal waffle. If you have access, the concierge club has also certainly stepped up their food offerings in the evening, sticking with a \"theme\" and offering heavier options if you wanted to skip dinner. Kristen is so friendly and helpful, that I feel like I'm \"home with friends\" when I'm in town. Also, I enjoy this club room most because you have the option of ordering \"room service\" delivered to the club room to enjoy (as opposed to eating alone in your room). More Marriott's should consider this. The rooms have a modern feel to them and like others have commented, a higher room offers a nice view. The thread count on the sheets is heavenly and the curtains are great at keeping the room as dark as you need. The one challenge is that your cell phone may not work for long in certain rooms before you lose the call. If you are patient, you will sometimes find the exact spot you need to stand/sit in to not lose the call, or it may not be an issue. Also, although I'm not a gym person, I do like to take walks. Outside, next to the hotel is a HUGE parking lot that stretches multiple city blocks if you wanted to get out (and enjoy the 100+ degrees).

When I'm working I can kick back in the lounge chair with my laptop and get tons of work done. The decor is nice, great in-room coffee and the building is insulated so you don't hear any traffic noise. You feel like you are at home, not in a hotel. - Bathrooms are exceptionally clean and elegant. Great towels and salon grade bath products. - Love the gym: It's on the roof level. After a morning workout I love going outside to catch the Dallas skyline in the morning. - Concierge Room: It has a great breakfast, great staff and is a very comfortable spot if you need to have a small meeting on the road. - Excellent staff: I feel like they knew me the second time I showed up! Everyone is very attentive and friendly. - Love the restaurant: It's farm to table style. Everything is fresh and delicious. If you appreciate eating excellent food sourced locally, you'll appreciate the food here. - Great value: it's competitive with all the hotels near downtown and you get so much more. - Easy parking: You can self park or valet. No downtown traffic or tight garages. If you are looking for top tier hotel near downtown Dallas, you can't go wrong with this one.

This hotel is literally five minutes from home, but it has a pool on the roof, and we do not! So, we went for the pool: to relax, catch a few rays, read a book and pretend we were in some other location for 24 hours. We checked in early and were given a room on the 30th floor as we had requested. The room was spacious, clean, classy and very comfortable. The only complaint we have is that the AC did not seem to cool at the level to which it was set during the middle of the night. This warmed things up a bit. Nice big bathroom. Two sinks, one separate from the bathroom. Large shower/tub and good water pressure. Very clean. Lovely thick towels and plenty of them. Now on to the pool: This is a rectangular 3 foot deep pool approximately 20 X 40 feet. It is on the outside on the very top of the building. You must get to the pool area by going up a flight of stairs from the 30th floor and cutting through the very nice, very well air-conditioned exercise room. We were not there to exercise. We ordered room service to be delivered poolside. The food was good, service was fast, and they really did a nice job with napkins, ice buckets, arranging the umbrella, etc. Life was good until about 3:30PM. Management came around to the handful of guests who were basking like us and informed us that the pool was being shut down and we all had to leave the pool area due to \"maintenance issues\". Now, since we had gone there specifically for this pool, that did not make us too happy. We went down to the front desk to check out. There we were met by staff members who offered to drive us to the Marriott pool down the street. We would have taken them up on that, but the Marriott down the street is not a Marriott I want to spend any time in whatsover. The front desk, who knew we were there to use the pool (and that it was our anniversary) were most understanding. They gave us our room for less than half price and gave us a deal to stay another night along with a free in-room movie. They promised that the pool would be repaired by the next morning, and in fact, it was. We really enjoyed the bar at Asador and we actually ate dinner in the hotel at Asador both nights. It was very pleasant, relaxing, and the service was excellent. Asador can cook a really decent steak. All of the servers at the bar and in the restaurant knew our name and treated us like we were regulars. I was surprised at this level of attention. We did enjoy the complimentary breakfast both mornings as well, and we were not disappointed. Overall, it was a great staycation destination.

Wow ! What an amazing experience the whole stay was ! Even better than my first time about a year ago when the hotel was undergoing renovations. I arrived at the hotel early, around 8am, as I drove from Philadelphia and was exhausted from the long drive. Of course I didn`t expect for my room to be ready that early, despite the fact that I`m a Marriott Platinum member, but decided to take the chance nonetheless and see if they had any rooms available so I could go to sleep. As soon as I walked up to the front desk both ladies who were working immediately dropped what they were doing and greeted me with a warm, genuine smile. Now as we all know on many occassions that doesn`t happen anymore. In many hotels, front desk personnel not only don`t greet you with a big smile but they don`t even get their eyes off the computers and acknowledge you`re even there ! I dealt with Melissa, who was the front desk supervisor. Not only did she check me in at 8am with no hassle but she also upgraded me to one of their lovely corner one bedroom suites ! She welcomed me back to their property by my last name and wished me a pleasant stay. In the meantime, from bell man to floor attendants to valet, everyone was so nice and always ready to help. Half the time I had breakfast at their club lounge which is stocked with everything you need for a great start and half the time at their lobby restaurant named Asador by Chef Dean Max, which was equally good, especially the made-to-order omelettes and all the different varieties of fresh fruit. I also had dinner there one evening. All the ingredients they use for breakfast, lunch and dinner are as fresh as you can get and you can tell the difference, believe me. Everyone working the club lounge was so polite and accomodating also but Kathy Loomis, Kamu Patel and Tambry really stand out. They are professional but at the same time have fun and you can tell they sincerely love what they do. My suite was beautiful, with ample room, amazingly comfortable bed with lots of pillows, two large flat screen HDTVs and a full sofa bed in the living room for another guest. Internet is wired and wireless and it`s free for Gold and Platinum members ! Lastly, their pool is located on the 31st floor and it`s awesome with breathtaking views of the downtown Dallas skyline ! Gym is pretty decent with free weights, machines and water and fresh fruit to keep you hydrated and it`s right next to the swimming pool on the top floor. Fourth of July was great from the rooftop swimming pool as we saw the fireworks lighten up the city. When you`re in Dallas you should definitely try to stay at the Renaissance. If the same employees I talked to -and there were lots of them- are still working there, trust me, they will not let you down ! Tips. Have dinner at Asador. The food is exceptional ! Try to visit the Dallas and the Kimball Museum of Art in Fort Worth. They are both world-class. Join Marriott Rewards at front desk, as points add up fast ! I always try to tip the person cleaning my room and the club lounge attendant. You don`t have to but they will truly appreciate it.

First of all, the location is great. Less than 10 minutes from Downtown and the airport and most of my clients. Rooms on the city side have a great view of the Dallas city skyline. Freeway close to lots of nice restaurants and local landmarks like the American Airlines center where the Mavericks play. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Each one has an HD flat-screen TV with lots of inputs up front for video, hdmi, computer and Ethernet. Lots of TV channels to choose from including several ESPNs and HBO and HBO Family. Beds are very comfortable with lots of pillows to choose from. Rooms have a small fridge and safe and desk for working. LOTS of outlets by the bed and at the desk for your chargers, computers, etc. , which is great if you are a business traveler with lots of devices. Bathrooms have plenty of hot water and lots of towels. Lighting is good for the morning prep in front of the mirror. The only area that falls short is the wireless internet. The signal and bandwidth are usually not good enough to support a video chat on my computer and while browsing, pages are often slow to load. The food in the restaurant is really good. Lots of fresh grilled ingredients and a good variety. Menu items range from about $10 for a brisket sandwich up to $40 for the cowboy steak with most items being between $10 and $20. They smoke and grill many of the items and the taste of the food is really good. Breakfast buffet is also very good with lots of fruit choices and well prepared eggs, little potatoes, bacon and sausage. They also have a breakfast menu for prepared dishes if you want to skip the buffet. Marriott Elite members will enjoy great skyline views in the Club Lounge with complementary hors d'oeuvres and dessert items and non-alcoholic beverages in the evening. Alcoholic Beverages including wine, beer and mixed drinks can be purchased. Hotel staff are pleasant and helpful and willing to do what it takes to resolve anything that has come up.

For all travelers - Be sure you visit the pool above the 30th floor where the gym is located. and take a look at the view from the observation deck on top of the roof. Restaurants on site are on the expensive side so be prepared to eat out from time to time if you are on a budget. Food is fair onsite with a couple of very good choices in the seafood. The steak salad seems to be a favorite among frequent guest. Hotel is not located with restaurants in close proximity, either a short cab ride or take your own car. Staff is great at giving directions and even printing out maps. Room size varies given the design of the hotel. Smaller rooms are towards the end with larger rooms towards the middle. You stand a better chance of getter a larger with double bed request as opposed to a king bed. So if you want the room, go for the double. Room can also be a \"little\" noisy at times. Doors are heavy and loud. For some reason people tend to forget this at 2 in the morning. If you have a room with a connecting door, pretty good chance you can hear everything your neighbor says and does. Remember, this works both ways and they can hear you as well.

The most convenient hotel to the Dallas Market Center, we even walked to the DMC one day. Windy that it was, we took the shuttle the remaining days to the show, and the front door men were so kind, quick and receptive when we needed to call the shuttle to come and pick us up after we had missed the regular schedule each morning. Also, We loved the breakfast buffet. Waking up to the hot and warm foods and fruits was a great way to start our morning. And Reuben, one of the wait staff for the breakfast buffet was fantastic! He was our waiter just about every morning. So personable and made sure we always had what we wanted and needed. The only 2 cons, which really wasn't a con for the Renaissance, just hotels in general, is that the 2 double bed rooms were booked when I reserved my room. Was guaranteed at least a King and possibly a doubles room after the second day, but when I checked in the hotel clerk offered me a 1 queen room. But that was quickly remedied, we did get a King room, and we did indeed \"eventually\" get our 2 doubles room on the 3rd night. Also, my mother mentioned being able to hear our neighbors each morning taking a shower.

The coffee rocked! Coffee maker in room and complimentary coffee there was good as well. There was also a bar and a snack/magazine room in the lobby that we did not try. We utilized the internet access room and found everything in working order and comfortable. The pool/hot tub on the roof was being rennovated. The workout room looked very nice. The only complaint we have about our stay was the first night- night before the run when sleep was very important (happened to be a Sat night.): Guests keep returning in waves to their rooms until 3 am. They were very noisy in the hallways..heard all the talk and slamming doors- very annoying! The next night was quiet- though a bomb could have gone off and I was possibly too tired to have heard.

I woke up this morning to the smell of bleach in my room. I'm not sure if it was a result of the horrible climate control system bleeding it into my room from another room that was being cleaned out, or if it permeated the walls via osmosis. Now, I may be spoiled from staying at the likes of Super 8 and Motel 6, but this was the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in. I'll start with the internal sounds: a) person in next room showering b) person in next room's cell phone going off repeatedly with nobody answering c) person in next room zipping their luggage d) person in next room BRUSHING THEIR TEETH (they did a good job - about 2 minutes of vigorous brushing was audible) e) every door on the floor slamming (This also caused my king sized bed to shake) f) what i ended up deciding was pipes passing water from flushed toilets above me - the first two nights i thought it was airplanes passing over head irregularly every few minutes (i think that was also happening) g) train with a crossing it honks for right across the parking lot - this one was probably the least annoying, i leave near a train anyhow and i'm used to this. This place seriously had the worst noise insulation I've ever experienced in my life at either hotel or motel. I've stayed at hostels that were significantly more quiet despite the amorous German couple in the same room. The climate control was horrible - after smelling the bleach and hearing all the noise, I decided the room just has too many holes in it to retain a stable temperature for too long. It was about 40f outside, and I had the thermostat set to 72. It would cool the room to 72, the A/C would cut off, and I could immediately feel the room begin to warm up, as if there were a large space heater hidden some where in the room. I ended up setting it to 65f - way too cold, but it at least didn't get so hot I was sweating. The wireless Internet service was horrible - unusable in fact. It was just overloaded; router dropped about 30% of packets on a full strength signal. They even firewalled outbound mail so I couldn't send any mail. Gotta stop all those spammers with rooms at the Marriot. I complained about this and they took the $13 a day charge off my bill. The staff was very friendly and helpful, no complaints there at all.

Now, with that comment, let me get to the Renaissance Dallas. I stayed at this hotel from 9/28 through 10/2 and had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is an extremely easy 20-minute drive from the airport. I did not use valet parking as there was ample space available at the hotel. I was there for business and worked a late shift each night. I returned to the hotel after midnight each day. I always felt safe although I was alone each night. Don't get me wrong, I am always alert as you should be anywhere. But there was noone lurking or any suspicious activity. The lobby was nicely decorated with a splash of red if I recall. The bar and resaurant was to the right of the lobby. I ate at the bar late Monday night. Service was a tad slow, but the food was pretty good. It was the same night as Dallas vs. Carolina so there were quite a few folks milling around. My profile indicates high floor away from elevators. I had a high floor (21), right next door to the elevator bank. My first thought was that heavy use in the A.M. would wake me. However, there was minimum activity during the hours I arrived each night, and not once in the mornings did they wake me. And while I was working in the rooms, I rarely even heard the elevator noise. I had two double beds. The beds were very comfortable. There was a corner couch with ottoman. Very nice touch and it was also comfortable. In addition there was a desk area to work from and a large flat screen TV. When you enter the room, the restroom and closet is immediately on your left with a sink area outside of the stall and shower area. Nice to have 2 sinks. My view was of the Children's Hospital area. However, I did not spend much time looking out of the window. Although a Marriott rewards member, I am not Platinum. However, my company was being welcomed as a new partner during the month of September. So I was granted access to the Club Level on 27. Now, this was the crown jewel of my visit. It is absolutely awesome with great views of downtown. I only made it for the evening appetizers once. They were decent. Sesame chicken strips, a variety of cheeses, and crackers. There was an honor bar and the water and non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary. There is also 2 computers and a printer available for use. I recall 2 very large TVs as well that I bet will be used a lot during football season. Breakfast is also available in the club level. I made it to breakfast the day of checkout. It was not a buffet. Eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, etc were served. Best breakfast I've had in a Marriott club level room. I think it may also be referred to as the concierge level. During my stay I received a welcome call from Joanne Horn (Business Trvl Mgr) as well as a follow-up email. Very nice touch. Every staff associate I encountered was nice.

Also the Gym which I always use in hotels has some okay cardio equipment but otherwise is really very JackLalanne circa 1972. Pool is nice on the roof, hardly any lounges to lay on though. Also because it's so high they walled off the view I guess to keep drunken guests from falling off.

Even after reading other negative reviews, I decided to stay here rather than at the Marriott Suites across the interstate. Although the suites had many rave reviews, I chose the Renaissance for the view and the package deal (Escape! Shopping). For only $159 a night, I got an Executive Suite that included a late night snack with wine and continental breakfast. The snack had to be requested each night 30-60 minutes ahead of time and was different each night. To enjoy the continental breakfast, you had to go the hotel restaurant only to receive cereal!!! Now for the service and staff of the hotel or lack thereof. Upon arrival, I was checked-in in an almost rushed fashion. There was no recognition of my elite status or welcome gift as with most other hotels. When entering the room, it was spacious, but slightly dated and worn. There were two beer caps on the floor and a rather humorous white stain on the seat of the desk chair. My request of a downtown view was not honored. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side, but amenities were wonderful. I am planning on purchasing some of the Lather products. On my second night in the hotel, the shower handle broke and rendered the shower unusuable. I immediately called to have it fixed. After an hour, the engineer left to look for a replacement part. We were leaving to enjoy the Saturday night and I stopped at the front desk to request a phone call if we needed to move. The rude staff informed me that I just needed to check the front desk when I got back, even if it was late and they would tell me if I needed to move. I did this and at 2am was told I would be moving. I had to request assistance with my bags!!! The only good side was that I finally got a view of downtown, but no other apologies were made for the inconvenience. Once in a functional room, pleasant sounds of drilling and hammering provided an unrequested wakeup each morning at around 8:30 and throughout the entire day until around 4. At checkout, an error with the bill (phone & internet charges) had to be fixed. Once again, the staff made no attempt to apologies and did not act as if you were a valued customer at all. Gathering from the patrons of the hotel bar, this hotel is primarily a place for Southwest Airlines employees to stay so they aren't concerned about making any good impressions. Overall, the rooms are okay, but slightly dated and damaged. The staff could've come straight from a Comfort Inn as far as I'm concerned. Everyone from the front desk to the engineer to the bartender showed unpleasant and rude behavior. The maid service was friendly though.

The smell of fresh paint permeated the floor, although, our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have been recently painted. The bathroom itself was a bit on the small side, but with a sink in and outside of the bathroom it made life a bit easier. The room was extremely clean and we found the staff to be very friendly. With temps in the low 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s we decided to checkout the roof top pool and discovered their website photos are a bit deceiving. The pool furniture was old and not very aesthetically pleasing. The pool itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horribly dirty, but I think it could have been a tad bit cleaner. I realize not many business folk are into taking a dip in a hotel pool, but I do think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more they could have done to make it more eye appealing. All in all we enjoyed our stay and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate in recommending it to someone else or staying there myself again.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bellarina126", "ReviewID": "UR7161612", "Content": "This beautiful hotel is close enough to downtown with easy access to all the major freeways throughout the metroplex.

There is an extra sink and mirror which is great for two people sharing a room. It is clean and they are generous with bathroom linens. The view is beautiful at night if you are high enough and facing downtown. The T-Bones Steak Restaurant is very good whether you are eating a full meal, or prefer a salad and soup. Their tortilla soup is wonderful.

I only wish that they had had an alternative to the incredibly sweet pastries that are obviously the delight of all Americans. Something bland, like plain wholemeal bread, for those of us who choose not to take on masses of sugar with every bite, would have been appreciated, and perhaps a pop up toaster in the room would have been nice. The Shuttle Bus was, for me, a bit of a disaster. Not as easy to arrange as they would have you think. I ended up at the wrong rail station on the first morning, and I quickly gave up the idea of using it and relied on taxis ($18 to the Dallas Convention Centre), which the Front Desk quickly and cheerfully arranged for me.

I was staying in Dallas for some training and pre-paid for my hotel a couple of weeks ahead of time. The training was supposed to be 5 days but it was shortened to 4 days instead. When I came back to the hotel I spoke to a gentleman named David to see if it was possible to get a refund or credit for that last night. He told me it should not be a problem but to speak to Senedu in the morning because he did not have the ability to do it for me. I looked for her in the morning and she had not yet arrived. I came back during my lunch break and explained my situation. She told me that I could not receive a refund or credit because I pre-paid. I said thanks and went to my room. When I was leaving a few minutes later I wanted to give her a heads up that her employee said I could get a refund and she should inform him that it is not possible for those who pre-pay so he doesn't misinform someone else in the future. At this point she went off about the fact that I was not going to get a refund (which I wasn't asking for) and would not let me speak. She actually interrupted me mid-sentence to go into a soapbox and would not let me get a word in. I finally said that I didn't appreciate her rudeness and the fact that she would not let me speak and I left. She had other employees with her behind the counter and all of them looked embarrassed about the way she was acting. I spoke to one of those employees later and he was appalled by the way she acted. He told me that she can be nice but it depends on the person. He said I probably rubbed her the wrong way and that set her off. I spoke to other staff members and most of them said that she was difficult to work with and for. They asked me why I was bringing it up and when I mentioned what happened none of them seemed surprised. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201chotel is good place..

I wanted a hotel that I could get to easily by rail from the airport, and the Moore fit the bill. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a bit of a view of Pikes Market and the waterfront. The front desk is extremely helpful, Robert and Tracy were awesome! They helped with bus schedules, restaurant recommendations, and loads of general Seattle information. The room was a bit chilly, but the front desk was quick to offer extra blankets, so we were very comfortable. Even though the rooms do not have a small refrigerator, I bought some cheese at Pikes that the staff was kind enough to store for a couple of days in their refrigerator :-) We were not interested in a hotel with a fitness center or big restaurant, so the Moore was a great option for saving a bit on the room rate so we could enjoy more activities. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I will stay there again.

My advice:don't do it people, just don't. Go for a brand name hotel, and pay a little more. That way, if something goes horribly wrong, you may have a shot at getting some kind of resolution. This is a true story, swear to God: my husband went to wipe himself off with a towel-twice while taking a shower and both of the towels had fe..s on them. Yes, fe..s. He flipped out and took the towels to the front desk. The manager was not there, and upon checking out, I explained to the girl at the front desk that not only was this appalling, but dangerous. Particularly to my one month old baby. I also told her, that I did not feel like I should pay for our stay there. I did pay though (Dumb. In retrospect, I should not have), because I just thought I would settle this with the manager later. My thought was the manager would listen to what happened to us, and act appropriately. That didn't happen. I emailed \"Mike\", the manager, then followed up with a phone call. He basically called m a liar, said that \"never in my career have I ever heard of something like this\", to which I replied, \"Well I haven't heard of anything like this either in all my years of traveling, but this really did happen.\" He then proceeded to give me the third degree about where the towels were located, when this happened blah blah, etc. It was very apparent that he felt that this was some creative attempt on my family's part to get a refund. God, what a jerk. I am POed all over again just writing this. I asked for a refund, he said no, then I told him that I would need to file a complaint with the BBB. He then said, \"Go ahead! I don't care, you can threaten me all you want!\" Uh, no Mike this isn't personal, just horrendous customer service. Like, on very level imaginable. Whatever. I told him, fine.

That is very convenient. The parking issue is a royal pain in the butt and I thought there must be internet or something in the lobby because it always seemed full in the morning (no internet elsewhere its just an old building) but discovered Sunday morning everyone was sitting around because the parking garage didn't open until 9am. Glad I didn't have to be anywhere! Booked months in advance and was in for a rude surprise then we checked out and they tried to charge significantly more than the agreed price. There is another place nearby with significantly more to offer for much less but I dig \"historic\". I don't dig surprises. Eventually the manager made good but it was after I got home. The restaurant next door turned the music up LOUD one night as if to tell my group GET OUT as soon as we sat down. That was fine, there's an Irish pub on the back side of the block (not the douchey one down by the market place) that had excellent food at excellent prices and the nicest staff we've ever encountered in downtown Seattle. If the other place hadn't chased us off we'd never have found the good place. The Moore doesn't even know what the word amenity means. What you get is a very clean room with a small TV and in our case a great view. There is nothing else, no fridge, coffee or microwave. The cleaning staff is terrific (cleaned our room twice one day which was funny and sweet). It was November so it was cold. There is no A/C and we don't think the heat ever came on in the 3 days we were there. Waking up at the crack of dawn and searching for breakfast was quite the adventure. The coffee shop next door (adjacent to the lobby) is terrific. The new owners are great. It kept the cloying damp at bay and prevented me from melting down when I discovered our car was being held hostage after we'd moved all our stuff downstairs and given up the room key.

For example, we were boarding the cruise ship when I suddenly realized I had left my parka in the hotel lobby when we checked out. I telephoned the hotel in a panic, and a staff member jumped in his car and tracked me down at the pier, jogged up to me with a cheerful smile and my parka in hand, and tried to refuse the money I offered him in compensation for his time, trouble, and expense.

CONS: -The comforter was a little \"plasticy\" and there no duvet for it, just 2 sheets folded around it. This quickly came undone and I was a little skeeved by the lack of skin-to-blanket barrier. -The water temperature would on occasion go from the set temperature to screaming hot, and back.

My advice is to aim the water lower so you can escape quickly to the end of the tub. Overall I'd recommend this hotel.

Right off, we had a car, so parking might have been an issue, but we always parked after 9 at night and were gone before 8 am, so on street parking was free. Otherwise there was a $12 all day parking lot very close by. We were traveling with my sister and her daughter. They were staying at the plush Sheraton for a conference. Since we were not going to be in the room alot, we didn't want to pay the $360 per night that the Sheraton was asking. Hence, we booked a room at The Moore. After dropping off my sister and her daughter at the Sheraton and seeing their plush room, coming to the Moore was shocking. It is an older type hotel - like something you'd find in an older section of Europe. when we checked in at 10:30 p.m., the lobby was dimly lit, but I did notice beautiful furniture and artwork. Also, there was a disco next door of some sort with loud music. I was just beside myself. Then we took the elevator up to the top floor for our room - again, when I switched on the lite I was grimacing. It was your very basic room. I quickly realized that it was \"dim\" because they were using CFL lightbulbs (good for them!), so it quickly got much brighter. The first night I didn't know what to expect, but we were there for four nights so I was going to make the best of it. It quickly grew on us and by the end of our stay, I downright liked it. The walls were tastefully painted, it was clean, although old. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. It had a great view out the window. It was not hot or stuffy. The exterior hallways had nice artwork and were clean. And every night when we came back to our room, we couldn't wait to see what new animal shape the maid had created out of our towels and left them artfully on our very comfy bed. Yes, maid service! My sister didn't even get that at the Sheraton!. So, even though a bit shocking start, we really liked this hotel, the location was fabulous (although it is in a so-so neighborhood, so caution is in order), parking was easy and everything turned out fine.

Didn't even say hello, and when we questioned why he was printing a receipt from the credit card machine with our credit card details when we weren't paying for our room until check out, he got extremely defensive and uppity. Later on, we spoke to another, younger guy at reception, who was also incredibly rude and was saying very explicit swear words, even to older guests. This was so unprofessional to us. Our room was basic, the bed wasn't particularly comfortable but everything was generally clean. After we checked in at reception, we went upstairs to our room and, after trying to enter, we discovered a man was in our room watching TV. what the hell? was our reaction. I think he worked at the hotel, but again, unprofessional. The next day, a guy at reception gave us the wrong directions to the airport...good job we checked it with somebody else or we would have missed our flight. The shared bathroom was dirty and the toilet was blocked for a period of about 8 hours (it was blocked in the morning when my boyfriend had a shower, and was still blocked by the evening when i showered). Luckily we had a toilet and sink in our room. The only good point about this hotel was the free to use computer in the lobby with fast internet. Then again, that is expected these days with hotels.

I chose this hotel based on location and price. I will admit to being a little nervous as we pulled up in front of the hotel - it's definitely nothing to look at - but the lobby had an old-time charm to it, and the staff were warm, friendly, and helpful. I was given a verbal description of three available rooms and allowed to choose: one with a clawfoot bathtub, one on a newly remodeled floor, and one with a view of the water. I chose the waterview, which was on the seventh floor facing Second Ave. And received, to my great surprise, an actual KEY - not the key card you get at all the chain hotels. You can see the water over the tops of the other buildings. The room was quite large, with a very high ceiling and two big windows that you can open - which is a good thing, because there is no air conditioning, and the weather during my stay was sunny and warm. There was a small tabletop fan, which was a huge help both in cooling down the room and in providing white noise to counter the traffic in the street below. Very plain decor, institutional-looking bedspread and drapes. Nice little table near the windows, but the chairs seemed low when using them with the table. The bathroom was small, and it puzzled me. In the space where a bathtub would normally be, there was a shower stall. There were walls on both sides of it, which made the space next to the toilet uncomfortably small. And that shower was extremely temperamental temperature-wise - it would not maintain a constant temperature. All that being said, however, the hotel was clean and just a short walk from Pike Place Market and Westlake Center (and the monorail). When you input the address shown here on TripAdvisor, it doesn't line up with what I found in reality; it's on Second Ave between Virginia and Stewart, right next door to the Moore Theatre, which did not have any events during my stay. This puts it on the same block, practically next door to some kind of housing called the Josephinium, a \"Recovery Cafe\" and what appears to be a group of social service agencies. So there were some interesting characters hanging out in front of those buildings - but they were not of the type who accosted passersby. The public transportation buses are free within a downtown zone which includes the Moore Hotel. A cab down to the Amtrak station cost, as I recall, about $12.

However, after going there and staying in two different hotels just a few blocks from each other, I can say that the Moore is the best deal. It's literally 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. The rooms are bare and old, yes, but very clean. The cleaning staff even makes towel animals like they do on cruise ships - a small but thoughtful gesture for a minimally staffed hotel. My only \"complaint\" is that the bathroom is VERY small, which wasn't a problem for me but if you're claustrophobic I would not stay here. Things I didn't know before staying there: the hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby though it's not advertised so you should ask the receptionist. In addition, it is a historic hotel and is next to The Moore Theater. Both of which were featured in a little walking food tour we did, so be sure to check out the theater, I hear it's beautiful on the inside! Bottom line: If you don't care too much about hotel amenities and are just traveling to explore the city, then the Moore provides a perfect place to sleep and have easy access to downtown Seattle. Parking is definitely an issue though, so if you are traveling with a car I'd look into another hotel that offers parking.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLocation, good.

We stayed a couple nights over the summer and found it to be okay, if not great. Our room seemed reasonably clean, but the furnishings and facilties are clearly old. By old, I don't mean 1980's old - the hotel was built in 1907. That said, we had reasonable expecations and we were comfortable enough. The view of the Space Needle from the fire escape was also pretty amazing. Whether you enjoy the Moore or not depends mostly on you. If you're used to cheap places with a backpacker / hostel feel, you'll fit right in at the Moore. If you generally choose the Hyatt, you should probably avoid it. I would also avoid the Moore if I were extremely safety-conscious. This is not the building I would want to be sleeping in during an earthquake or a fire. Our biggest inconvenience was parking. We were in town for a couple weeks and had a car and a lot of stuff. We ended up paying a fairly hefty rate to stay at a skeevy parking garage down the street. By the time we wrestled the luggage up and down a (very dodgy) parking garage stairwell a few times, I started to suspect we might have been better off staying somewhere else. Bottom line, if you're travelling light and cheap and want a good downtown location, the Moore is probably a good choice. If you have a car to park, or a lot of luggage, or you tend to like newer places, get on Priceline or Hotwire and check out their deals on chain hotels.

We spent 3 nights in Seattle at the Moore Hotel. I have to admit, I am cheap when it comes to paying for lodging, especially if it's only to sleep (and not taking advantages of any amenities), which this one was. But, on the other hand, you do get what you pay for. We were on the 5th floor. It seemed that they were slowly remodeling the hotel because the 3rd floor seemed newly painted and had nice light fixtures in the halls (though didn't see the rooms) , as opposed to our floor that was dingy and creepy, kind of like the place in The Shining. The room was basically that. A decent sized room with a dresser, TV, nightstand with phone and bed. There was no desk or chair. There was nowhere to sit except on the bed. The walk-in closet was nearly as big as the room but that was a non issue for us. No A/C but a small fan on top of the TV. We didn't need AC as the weather was cool in late July. BUT the downside to that was that you had to open your windows.... (not a place for small children as there weren't even screens) to get a breeze. That made for a terribly loud night's sleep. The carpet was creepy (not necessarily dirty, but dingy) and I kept shoes on my feet at all times. The bathroom was the pits. It was old and you had to step up about 18\" into THE smallest shower I've ever seen. The thing that killed me and I'm not sure why but the toilet didn't have a cover. Just a seat. Like you're using the bathroom at a rest stop. Since the bathroom was so small, there was no place to put your toiletries and I was afraid that anything I precariously perched on the edge of the sink was going to fall into the toilet. I carried on a lot about the toilet not having a cover and I think my husband got tired of listening to me but I just found it really strange! (We stayed in a Quality Inn in Los Angeles for less than Moore Hotel and the QI had coffee makers in the room AND continental breakfast (and FREE parking) and was way nicer than Moore.) The positive of the place is that the location is BONUS and the rate is fair, keeping in mund what you get for that rate. It's about 3 blocks from Pike's Market which is central. We walked to the space needle and I'd say it was a good mile's walk, but definitely do-able. There's coffee about a block in either direction, but you still have to LEAVE the building. Another minor benefit was internet access in the lobby but even though they post a 15 min time limit, it was in use all the time. I probably wouldn't stay here again. I've never stayed in a hostel, but this place is what I think a hostel would be like. I'm too old for that!!

Parking will cost you $20.00 per day in the parkade. Lobby: Once you step inside, you are greeted with a marbled reception like area. Friendly staff to check you in promptly and help with any questions or concerns. The building has a very outdated elevator, something that is par for the course considering the age of the building.

At over $100 + per night in December, wasn't precisley a budget hotel. We chose a room/suite that had kitchenette and it was room 705.

The bathroom could use a renovation and had some mildew around the shower's edges. Additionally, the shower stalls drain was extremely slow, causing some water to overflow from the shower stall and onto the bathroom floor. (Hence, probably the reason there was mildew around the shower base.) A nice touch was that the towels were all folded into shapes to create a very lovely presentation. Even the toilet paper roll was folded into a seashell shape. Overall, the stay was nice and even though we had a room that face 2nd Street, there wasn't much traffic noise at all. Additionally, there was a show at the Moore Theatre the night we stayed. However, that show seemed to end by 11 PM and even when it was occuring, there wasn't much discernable noise coming from it to our room. All that said, I was able to soundly sleep at the Moore.

However it was very difficult to regulate the hot water and I got scorched a couple times. The initial staff that we dealt with when checking in were very pleasant but the night clerk, Bill, is a total jerk. One of our pillows was exceptionally flat and when we came in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30pm, I asked for an additional pillow and another bath towel. Bill rolled his eyes and acted like I had asked him to jog around the block twice in his undies.

Overall, the Moore is a good budget option right near the market, waterfront, ferries, downtown buildings (check out the public library), and bus lines to all the neighborhoods.

I checked in on Saturday afternoon, after 2:30. The room itself, the sink and the linens were all perfectly clean in appearance, feel, and smell. The tap water tasted fine, although I let it run for a while before filling my glass since it's an old building. The decor is not worth mentioning but just to be complete here it is; hodgepodge cheap motel style, which by definition is unattractive, but it wasn't remarkably ugly. There were 3 sets of towels, 4 cups and 4 bars of soap. There's no clock, but you can ask for a wakeup call, or use the TV to keep track of time (reception wasn't great on all channels, but the news & weather were fine). The toilet across the hall was a little concrete cell, but it was clean. The full bathroom right around the corner was roomy, clean, and dry. I didn't use the sink because I had one in my room, but I had no problem getting plenty of hot water for my shower. The water pressure could have been stronger, but it was adequate. I never had to wait for the toilet or the shower, nor did I have people waiting after me to use them. There were some rowdy neighbors late Saturday night, which I expected, but I'm an easy sleeper so it didn't bother me. There was some street/city noise from outside, but nothing extraordinary if you've ever lived in an urban setting. My time in the room was spent either getting ready to go out or to sleep... I wasn't around to experience noise from the theater downstairs, so I can't comment on that. The homeless are very direct in downtown Seattle, but they're also quite \"professional\" so it's not that big a deal. My impression was that they were just exercising their right to ask me for money and in turn, they respected my right to say no. I really enjoyed my stay because it was no fuss, no frills, and no ugly surprises, so I could concentrate on other things.

As you might imagine it is very expensive to stay downtown Seattle. In fact the West Coast has a much higher cost-of-living than Milwaukee. We checked out chain hotels, discount travel sites, and bed-and-breakfasts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but ultimately it was a travel guide (Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2005) that suggested The Moore Hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 blocks from the Public Market and sits on a main street (2nd ave) 1 mile from the train station. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 blocks southeast to the West Lake bus tunnel and there are literally dozens of cafes / clubs / and shops in every direction. We walked from the Amtrak station to the Hotel with our luggage when we arrived; and we walked from the Hotel to the bus station when we left - ideally situated for use of public transportation. We opted for the $55/night room which has no bathroom (\u00e2\u20ac\u2122european style\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). This was half the rate we found even at most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdiscount\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chains. The bathroom was about 10\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 from our room and we had our own key - so even though it was not a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcprivate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bathroom, it was never inconvenient. The picture on the Moore website is not one of the european style rooms - ours was much smaller. The hotel was built around the turn of the [20th] century so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of historic details that make it an exciting place to stay - tall ceilings, lots of windows, exposed woodwork, wide hallways. And most (if not all) of the 7 story hotel has been refurbished with new carpeting, fresh paint and retiled floors. In fact, the room we were in had brand new lamps, bed and TV. There is also a phone in each room (dial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc9\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 to get out) and basic cable. The only negative observations about our room were that the sink (all rooms have sinks) had no hot water pressure and Harmonie thought there should have been a full-length mirror and there was no clock. We were on the 7th floor - room 711 to be exact - and were afforded a great view of the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll upload some movies when I have some extra time so you can get a feel for the layout. I would highly, highly recommend staying here if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ever in Seattle - and ask specifically for room 711 as some of rooms are in-facing (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a kind of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccourtyard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 space running up the center of the hotel so that in-facing rooms can open to the fresh air\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a pretty view) and some of the south-facing rooms are on an alley. There is also 1 public-use internet terminal and wireless access in the lobby. The workers were very helpful with suggestions and they provide a big rack of literature for tourist-y things-to-do. The clientele seems quite mixed, with a lot of younger / international travelers as well as some older. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any families. There is no pool or arcade, but there is an adjoining lounge/bar and theatre (which was, unfortunately, playing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAnnie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 while we were there) which gets touring bands every now-and-then. Also there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no breakfast or coffee. There is also an elevator for those that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like walking up seven flights of old-timey stairs.

They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere. The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games. And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all. The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

You enter a small lobby with a few chairs to comfortably sit in, and one person working at the desk. A 2nd person is usually in the office next to the desk. Check out when parking is free on the streets before you pay 10 dollars for about 10 hours of parking in the lots. I think we could have saved 10 dollars if we read the signs. They are extremely nice and helpful. I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed them. You then take an elevator to your floor. When the elevator door opens, you start to giggle. \"I can't believe I booked this hotel\". I hope you have a sense of humor, or don't expect much. Expect the worst for ambience. The hotel is old. Very old. The walls have been painted over in a very dark color, along with almost black colored carpeting in a wide hallway. You get the feeling of entering an old dormitory at an old, and I stress OLD, school . You walk down the depressing hall to the door (which has one real key even if you have 4 people in the room). You leave the key at the front desk when you leave if others might need it to get in. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room. There were 4 of us. The bed was comfortable enough. The decor was 1944 bland. There was no place to put anything down in the bathroom, like a counter. The toilet was so close to the wall on its left that your butt hit the wall if you sat down. You had to sit more to the right. The flusher hit the wall, so they cut a hole in the wall to be able to flush the toilet. The shower was fine. Fat people could not use the facility here. Not in my room. There is no screen in the window and no air conditioning. We left the window open all night (birds could have flown in as there were many), and traffic noise went on. I had no problem sleeping, but others could not stand the sound of traffic. I was exhausted and crashed with no problem. Staying near Pikes Market means you are in the run down part of town. I would prefer to stay in a nicer section. I did not realize how scary it could be.You are literally a 5 minute walk from the Market, and a block or 2 further to the waterfront. It is all downhill, so remember you need to walk back up again. During the day it was ok. We walked past a lot of scary people. I would not go out at night. I did get up earlier than the rest of the group, and since I had no place to watch tv without disturbing them, I went downstairs. They told me there was a McDonalds that opens at 630am. I walked there. about 3 blocks.I met all the drunks in recovery while I bought my coffee. Starbucks opens at 7. I brought the coffee back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, comfortably reading until about 930 when others got up. Seattle seems to be the most expensive city in the country. I don't think you will be murdered if you stay here, but I think I would prefer to stay at the airport the next time I overnight for a cruise. Or in a nicer neighborhood. If you walk in the opposite direction from your hotel you come to a really nice (expensive) section with Nordstroms, and all sorts of expensive fancy stores. A nice area.

We took public transit ( MT194 / $1.25) from SEATAC, which lets you off 3 blocks from the hotel - an easy walk. This place is fantastic for the money if you don't require a lot of \"extras.\" They offer shared and private baths (the private baths go pretty quickly), and we tried out each. Even the shared bath option gives you a sink in your room. The hotel feels much like a hostel at first - it's old and not in the best visual condition, the hallways are a little dark, the elevator only holds a couple of people, and the doors to the rooms require *gasp* actual KEYS! The neighborhood is a little gritty, but we never felt unsafe at any time. It is a highly trafficked area, so you're seldom wandering about by yourself. Once inside the room, it's a pretty bare bones setup, but everything was super clean, functional, we had a fantastic view of the water, and the building is constructed like a prison (thick plaster walls), so we never heard a peep from our neighbors. The close proximity to just about everything is amazing - we walked to Pioneer Square (~25 minutes), Safeco Park (~35 minutes), Pike Place Market (less than 5 minutes), and took a quick bus ride over to the Seattle Center. This place is central to everything you'll need to explore Seattle efficiently and thoroughly. If you're into fancypants-type accomodations and need a lot of catering to, this place is not for you. There are no clocks in the room, no pictures on the wall, you may/may not get a mirror in your room, but the place is well worth the money that you'll save, and the service that we received from everyone working there was 5-star. They definitely have a lifelong customer in my guy and myself. The Moore Hotel is located smack on the border of Belltown, which is loaded with great eats, great bars, and tons of twenty/thirty-something hispters. For food, check out Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, OHanas, and Caffe D'Arte for awesome coffee/teas (skip Starbucks/Tully's). For entertainment, the Virigina Inn is a nice place to grab a beer, while places like Lava Lounge, Shorty's Coney Island, and The Whiskey Bar are more chaotic, but still good fun.

First we had never heard of the hotel but wanted to find a place for a night that was close to interesting city life (not really spent anytime in Seattle before) and was relatively inexpensive (budget) and also a place that was in an area where we felt safe to explore as well as one that was safe and clean to stay in. When my wife called the hotel number she got \"Bob\" on the other end, he absolutely was the reason that we decided to book a night at the Moore, in one phone call Bob answered every question she had and made her feel at ease about all her concerns (as listed above), still we thought that the price (for what he said on the phone about the area etc) was too good to be true. We arrived on the evening of July the fourth and Bob was working the desk, after meeting him we knew that he wasn't acting on the phone, VERY helpful and personable, every question again he answered and we were relieved and impressed. The room was great, very clean, quiet, it was everything we were hoping for. As we were there for only one night we didn't get to explore much but we felt like if we were to return that the Moore Hotel was for sure the place we would base out of next time. So we left the next day to camp in Oregon for a week'ish, we decided though to cut the camping short by a night and head back to the Moore to see more of Seattle, we were all excited feeling comfortable heading back to Seattle knowing that our nights stay was not a concern at all. So as if I wasn't impressed enough with the Hotel and its staff they went one step farther, as we pulled up to the Hotel after an 8 hour drive I see \"Ray Davies\" on the marquee for a show at the theatre that night, being a hobby musician I thought I would see about getting a ticket as the rest of the family wanted to walk around and shop, the manager of the Moore Hotel overheard me in the lobby and said that if I left my name with Bob that he would leave me a ticket for the show, this is right after I found meter parking right outside the front door of the hotel!!, I almost went and bought a lottery ticket I was feeling so lucky. Anyway a long story short, the show was great, I had a blast seeing Ray and being that I enjoy old buildings I was feeling very fortunate to be seeing the show (at no charge!!! things like this don't happen to me) in a theatre with such rich architectural character and history, it was an evening to remember, and it was all thanks to the Moore Hotel Mgt and staff. So big Thanks! to the Moore Hotel staff for the generous hospitality of the free ticket, and for the worry free couple nights stay we had, when in the area again we will definitely return to the Moore.

ROOMS: The Moore offers both rooms with private baths and rooms with shared baths. You'll save about $15-20/night if you take a room with a shared bath. I was a single traveler and took a room with bath for only $65/night. The same room for two people in it would have been ~$80/night. You won't find a lot of amenties, but at this price, I didn't care.

The rooms themselves were very clean, if a little worn in places like the bathrooms. Also, they were fairly large, so you won't feel like you're living in a closet. LOCATION: It can't be beat. It's between Pike Place and Belltown. The walk to each is about 3-5 minutes, if even that. TRANSPORTATION: From the airport buses (174 and 194), it's a 5-minute walk with luggage. You're also close to a ton of bus lines. I was able to save money and not get a car because of the great location. I took buses to the University district, Madison Park, Fremont, and Capitol Hill.

Free wireless internet is also available, but only in the lobby. STAFF: I found all of the staff I interacted with to be extremely helpful and friendly.

My spirit has been lifted. Our visit with Jayna was the best. It was raining when we landed at Sea-Tac, but by the time we loaded our luggage into the trunk of our rental car the sun was peaking through the clouds. The weather was cool, but when the wind blew it made the hair on your neck stand up. The Moore Hotel was nice. Our Room was on the 6th floor with a panoramic view of the Puget Sound. The room was clean and comfortable. If I could make a suggestion to the proprietor, it would be to put a small shelf in the bath room and a place to hang your robe behind the bathroom door would be nice. This hotel is in the heart of Downtown Seattle, a block east of Pike's Market Place and a block west of Nordstrom's. We spent a small fortune in parking, but all in all it was worth it. The Mariners swept the series with the San Francisco Giants. Barry Bonds hit a home run his first at bat. So did Ichiro. Day 2 Mike went to the ballgame with his brothers Randy and Steve for game two of a three game series. It was Gay Pride week in Seattle. Jayna and I exhibited our diversity and joined the festivities at the Fremont Street Fair. This is it's 35th year of celebrating the Summer Solstice. It was a large diverse group of warm bodies. Belly dancers, floats and naked men and women (sporting only body paint) danced through the streets raising awareness to the needs of low-income and the homeless community (the 6 foot tall stuffed penis got my attention). The fair is free but donations are accepted. Donations received directly fund Fremont Public Association (FPA). The fair was loaded with exhibits, art, crafts, musical entertainment and food. Jayna and I escaped the hot pavement and retreated to a Thai restaurant. I had the Cashew Chicken with vegetables and rice, YUM! Jayna had the Chicken Curry with noodles. Afterwards, we met Mike and his brothers at Ivars to say our goodbyes. Then Mike, Jayna and I took the ferry over to Bainbridge and headed towards Port Townsend. Day 3 Jayna's friend Shannon was a life saver! Our reservation at the Water Street Hotel (WSH) was nearly lost. But Shannon was able to retrieve our room key before 6pm. Thank you Shannon! The WSH is very old. It was built in 1889 by EH Fisher. The Hotel offers a beautiful view of the Puget Sound, Mount Baker, the Cascade, and Olympic Mountains. It is in the heart of Downtown PT Historic District and within walking distance to shops, and restaurants. The festive spirit of Gay Pride week followed us up to Port Townsend. The WSH is above the Water Street Brewing and Ale House. The Ale House offered a masquerade/costume party on Saturday evening. The music was so loud you could hear hear it three floors up. The patrons partied until the early morning hours. The featured entertainer was DJ Ramiro. For breakfast we went to the Landing Restaurant. Jayna suggested the Baked Blueberry French Toast stuffed with Cream Cheese. Oh my Gawd! I highly recommend this one. Afterwards we walked out onto a pier and watched as boats docked. Then walked through all the shops downtown. The shops are all quaint and tastefully done. My favorite, was \"Maestrale\". An eclectic collection of old and new. I found the cutest cobalt blue antique drawer pulls. ~Cute-Cute-Cute!~ That evening we ate dinner at the Fountain Caf\u00c3\u00a9. We had dinner salads with Honey/yogurt dressing and Taylor Gold Pears. Our meal was the most flavorful blend of Italian cheeses, noodles and chicken. Most people call this Chicken Fettuccini. I say it was the best I've ever tasted. For dessert we shared a Cr\u00c3\u00a8me Brule. Oh My Gawd! This is the best restaurant in the world. We had the best waitress, the atmosphere was delightful and the Art exhibit was colorful. Day 4 We checked out of the WSH, then went to visit Jayna's friend Joe. He is a Barista in uptown PT near Aldrich's Market. Joe makes a mean latte. Day trip with Jayna to Fort Warden and the beach. We hiked to a remote cliff face with a 500 foot drop. Scary! Then we took a long long walk along the beach. We laughed, talked and reminisced. It was a good day. We took Jayna back to her house and made the drive back to Seattle and then home. I miss her.

When it became our turn to check in, he did the same for us except we got a room with 1 queen bed and 1 and twin bed. The person at the front desk was really nice and cordial.

Bathroom had plenty of towels and a good shower. We had two rooms to accomodate all of us. Room 424 had two rooms with a total of 5 beds. Windows aren't spotless, but they open so you can get a cool breeze. It was warm while we were there, not sure how warm the rooms would be if it is chilly outside. If you want lots of peace and quiet this might not be for you. Street was noisy till about 2 or 3 AM. We were all tired from our busy days so it didn't bother us. About 6:00 AM the city comes alive again. We had a small view of Elliot Bay from our room. Did not have a chair to sit in so we could look at the view. I did meet one gentleman in the elevator at 7 in the morning who was grumbling about having to feed the parking meter so early. Sounds like that is a Seattle downfall. Staff was very friendly and had our key ready for us when we would return from an outing. Only one key per room, so we left it with the front desk when we went out. I can't wait to go back!

I paid $286, including taxes, for four nights in a single room, and my friends paid $311 for a double. You can't beat that price for such a central location. The beds were very comfortable. Every day, the maid would pick up stuff of mine that was lying around and leave it neatly on the windowsill. My only complaint was with the bathrooms. I could not get my shower to deliver both hot water and good pressure, and the shower stall was extremely small. The toilet sometimes had to be flushed twice. Also, there was no plug for the bathroom sink, so I had to put a washcloth over the drain before putting my contacts in. My friends had one of the claw-foot tubs with shower curtain, and said they had no problems with the water. However, their toilet malfunctioned on our last day, and no one turned up to fix it.

After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price. I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle. However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap. First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle. There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider \"bad\", and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town. Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room. After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!! I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies. I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep. Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking. I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking, but the Moore had nothing. I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day. My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!

However, the desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and assured us not to worry about the people outside. We took the (tiny) elevator to our room, where we were very impressed with the cleaning job and the size of the room.

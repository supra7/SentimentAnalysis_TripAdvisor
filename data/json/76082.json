This was close to the airport, cheap and clean. The beds were very comfortable and we didn't have a problem with airport noise. However, the airport shuttle apparently stops running at 11pm, so we had to get a cab (only about $10, so no big deal). This hotel certainly served it's purpose as a place to crash after a late-night flight, before moving to a better hotel the next day. But I wouldn't recommend it for your entire Vegas vacation.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Bruno, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Front Desk Staff, Unreliable Courtesy Shuttle\u201d", "Author": "travelmaster75", "ReviewID": "UR126302476", "Content": "The Best Western McCarran is 2 blocks, or about 1 mile away from the strip. If your looking for basic hotel accomodations, away from the strip this hotel is perfect Rooms are very comnfortable, rates are great. and the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast, The front desk staff is very courteous and caring. I recall two front desk agents, that were very nice and caring during my stay. The morning agent, I don't recall her name, and the PM Agent, Candice, were very nice and accomodating. I would return, for caring people like them, who represent the company well, with their hardwork, and dedication to their guests. On the other hand, during my stay, I experienced several delayed shuttles, which made this stay somewhat difficult. Upon arriving to the airport, it took, several calls, before the shuttle driver came. In total I waited over 40 minutes, for a courtesy shuttle, that comes every 30 minutes. I was told by the driver, trafffic was bad, however the airport is 5 minutes away from the hotel. That same, night, I had to go back to the airport, and experienced the same senario, with a extremely delayed shuttle, despite calling the hotel several times. On my last day, I requested the shuttle from the Tropicana hotel, which again, came late, by about 30 minutes after the schduled pickup time. I'm sure traffic and weather delays affect arrivial time with the shuttle, however, to wait this long several times, for a courtey shuttle, thats operates close to the airport and strip, sounds odd. I definitly think, work needs to be done to correct arrival time for the shutte. As the saying goes, once is a experience, twice is a problem, three times is a trend. I really hope this experience is corrected for future guests.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel bad service\u201d", "Author": "boca_penguins", "ReviewID": "UR126266637", "Content": "The first impression they gave me was leaving me and my kids waiting in the cold because the airport shuttle was 25 minutes late.

She immediately gave me simple concise directions to the rental return garage, and informed me how to return to the hotel. My room was very clean and well furnished. The bed was turned down and extremely comfortable to sleep in. There were ear plugs on the night stand as the airport is nearby. I opted not use them as I don't sleep well with them in my ears. I am happy with my decision as I only heard two planes the entire night. The only issue I had concerning the room was the toilet. It was tiny and very low to the ground. Therefore, it was not comfortable to use. The hotel offered a complimentary continental breakfast. The standard bill of fare that filled the void. Checkout was a breeze and the free shuttle to the airport was quick and painless. Overall, I was greatly surprised based on some of the reviews I had read. The hotel was clean and comfortable, and all the staff I encountered were extremely polite and friendly. The best thing is that the hotel is a non-smoking facility which is a rarity in Las Vegas.

Great points; price, lovely staff, cookies and coffee and cold water at the reception 24 hours, comfy bed and all the channels. We asked to be placed on top floor where we can sleep and they obliged. Although nothing special, I actually liked the feel of the hotel inside, it had a nice atmosphere. Breakfast was not amazing but rather standard across such hotels and to be honest, for the price it was great. Not so great: room was overlooking the garbage and the garbage truck woke us up very early. Still I cannot say this is a fault of the hotel in any way. I did not hear the planes, but then again I grew up next to the airport and react more to man made noise. They did provide toiletries that went beyond the usual: hair gel, make up remover wipes and earplugs. Five stars for trying. The only thing I would say is they should explain to people that the room key needs to be inserted in the eco thing that regulates the air con. We did not know that first night and kept waking up to boost it. I did not notice it at the reception and this is the first hotel that had this system so I had no clue.

Let me tell you, when you are at your lowest, you find out who is there for you and who is not. The guy I was going to see, completely stood me up too, didn't find that out till I got there. When I got to the hotel, I realized that I forgot to put my money on my bank card and so the hotel wanted the entire money for the stay and $100 on top of that in cash, in which I didn't have because my money at home. After back and forth with the receptionist, the Manager stepped in and had an attitude at first but I firmly let him know that I'm stuck and was trying to get touch with someone. He worked something out that night so that I had somewhere to sleep, and said that if I had a certain amount by check out tommorrow morning I could keep my room for the next night and to see if I could get in contact with someone. Well I thought I had help but by noon that next day, I found out I was lied to by a friend. I had to check out and the same Manager allowed me to hang out in the lobby and go view Vegas while I was trying to change my flight to go home that day or get the money. They also allowed me to keep my luggage in their office to help me. The flights were all booked and I still had no help, it was 4pm and I had no where to stay or sleep. A random person who I cannot name heard my circumstance and gave me $20. Then one friend back at home said she could pay with her credit card, so the Manager figured out a way to get her information to pay for my room that 2nd night so I could go home the next day. I know this review is long but the Manager or stand in Manager at this hotel was amazing at really trying to help me with my circumstance. The rooms were great and comfortable and clean. The shuttle only goes till 11pm that picks u up to and from the Vegas Strip, it also takes you to and from the airport. Overall the shuttle guys were great too, had an incident with one being really late to pick up, but other than that it was good.

One of them was a little too chauvinistic to other employees and some of the other guests, but it didn\u2019t stop him from checking us in efficiently.

There were a number of vending machines around the place, but all of the ones on the ground floor had \u2018out of order\u2019 signs on them. We asked for the nearest restaurants for dinner and were directed a mile up the road towards the German Beer cellar. We walked there, but decided to get a cab back; the hotel is not surrounded by roads which are frequented by pedestrians. The bathroom was really clean and had the usual Best Western toiletries. The bed allowed us to sleep for several hours undisturbed ready for a six hour drive the following morning. One surprising observation was the state of the sheets. They were spotlessly clean, but were not pressed, and so looked as though the previous guest had only just left the room. It wasn\u2019t so, but they looked odd. The included breakfast was a bit of a scrum both to get the food and then to get a table, but no one was too aggressive and the lady looking after the buffet worked very hard to keep on top of things, most commonly sorting out the waffle machine after unsupervised kids had not followed the instructions.

So this year we needed again a hotel near the Las Vegas airport for 1 night and so we booked 2 rooms at the bestwestern.com website. We could book the senior rate for the 2 rooms and I must say, it was very, very cheap. Prices were going down in Las Vegas (crisis??) and it was a bargain. I received my reservation confirmation and everything was OK untill 2 months later. I took a look at my reservations at the bestwestern.com website and I saw that my whole reservation was cancelled. I had not asked for that! I send a mail to the bestwestern.com and they answered me to contact the free phonenumber in Belgium. So I did. The person I spoke to, was very very helpfull. He looked in the computer to see what has happened and just said \"What a mess\"! All I could do was making a new booking. So I did, the price was a little higher than the original booking and so he adviced me to ask at BestWestern to have the original price, because it was not my fault. I send a mail and they mailed back that it was OK. I looked to my reservation confirmation at their website and yes, they adjusted the higher price to the original price for the 2 rooms. Everything OK again. When we arrived at the McCarran, we had to sign 2 papers, one for each room. We looked at the first paper, and the price was correct. We signed it and signed the second paper too, without taking a good look at it, because we thought that the second room had the same rate. Back home, we saw that the second room had a higher price, it was 13 USD more than the original price. I took again a look at my reservation confirmation at the bestwestern.com and I saw that the price for the second room had been changed after my booking to the higher price. Can this be done???? I was lucky that I took a copy from the original confirmation with the original prices. So I mailed to the McCarran and send them the copy, but I received no answer. Then I mailed to bestwestern.com and they answered me after a week, that they would pay the difference of 13 USD back to me, but without any explination of what happened. Very strange. About the hotel I must say that we were again very pleased with it. For our bargain price, it was very very good, quiet, good breakfast, nice renovated room , no fridge but all the rest is there, good shuttle service.

Both experiences were fine. The staff here is very friendly (even in the early hours of the morning!)

Our first night was on the side facing away from the airport and facing the pool. Toiletries, which the hotel website doesn't mention, lovely fanned out towels and flannels (I'm impressed by little attentions to detail like that - they don't have to, but it makes a difference). We heard no planes. The second night we were on the airport facing side where you can see the tails of the planes moving round! We could hear planes - lots of them (and later saw the hotel from the plane!), but I guess they fly out in different directions at different times. Hearing planes can't be a complaint. The hotel is literally at the end of the runway - what do you expect?! It doens't keep you awake either. They run a shuttle service to and from the hotel/aiport, which we didn't use, but it's easy to get to the rental car place from this location, so it was well worth it. I reckon we had a better room as well with faux-suede foot thingy at the end of the bed, better mattress, better shower curtain (!), faux-silk valanace and a headboard. I don't know that I'd want to be based here for a week if I was just seeing The Strip, but, again, they have a shuttle, which was explained to us, and it seemed very easy.

Both of the shuttles work on a 'request' basis, whereby you need to call and let them know that you need a pick-up. That said, it probably only took 10 minutes after my call from the airport, which wasn't too bad. The hotel is a good 10-15 minute walk off the strip, along a busy highway, so the hourly free shuttle is the best way of getting to the action. It drops off outside the MGM Grand, which is also the pick-up point for the return trip. On a busy night like Saturday, it did seem a bit unnecessary to have to call for a pick-up to and from the Strip, as I'm sure that there were people waiting every hour (and phones are few and far between for us overseas visitors without a local mobile/cell phone). The room was a good size and clean, and check-in was efficient and cheerful. I'm glad that I had booked in advance, as 'Sold Out' signs were plastered over the entrance. Given the proximity to the airport, double glazing would have further minimised any exterior noise, but it was not too bad. The self-serve continental breakfast (free) was good, with several choices of cereals, juices, pastries etc. Unlike some chain motels, there was also a good sized area in which to eat. On my departure, I caught the shuttle to the airport, and the driver kindly dropped me very close to the hire car shuttle bus, which saved lugging my bags across busy traffic.

I checked out the website before booking here and one of the reasons I picked this hotel for this one-night stay is because I needed airport transportation...a hard thing to come by in Las Vegas unless you like taxis. In any case, the listing says that the hotel provides airport transportation and some transportation to a couple of named casinos, generous right?...Well, what the listing DOES NOT say, is that the hotel only operates that service until 7pm (which we, of course, landed later and had to wait in those lovely taxi stand lines). And then the next morning, when we needed a ride to the airport, we were told the shuttle only ran on the 1/2 hour and even though the van was there at a quarter-past the hour, we still had to wait another 15 minutes for them to take us to the airport. Maybe that is their \"policy\" but it wasn't made clear as to what those policies were before booking the room and honestly, as far as customer service is concerned, I think that is a poor decision not to run your shuttle in a \"city that never sleeps.\" On top of the shuttle disappointment, when we checked in to the room, the lady at the front desk, was rude and just in a \"general bad mood.\" Again, not the face and attitude one wants to see when already disappointed in a service error and then have to deal with rudeness too. She started out rude to my husband and I, but we are good at making people treat us better by just adding a little kindness. That worked, but when additional customers arrived and asked about room availability or customers who called and asked questions about why the shuttle service wasn't running, she was rude to them....which also was annoying. From my perspective of overhearing several inquiries about the shuttle service ending at 7pm, it was something many of their customers did not know and was disappointed to find out. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The lack of \"black-out\" shades was missed since we arrived so late and wanted to sleep in the next morning. The breakfast was better than many that hotels offer. Some kudos for that. Best Western hotels, in general, are lovely places to stay. I would have to say even consistently nice.

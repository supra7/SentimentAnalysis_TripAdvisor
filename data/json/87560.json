I had reserved two nights at this hotel online (which is non-refundable, don't do it!). I didn't want to stay on one of the nights, so I offered the hotel to one of my friend. I had called two times and told them that my friend was going to stay in the room, that I had already paid for. When the day came this email came in from my friend: I came here to the hotel and they didn't have any record of you or me contacting them about tonight. They wouldn't let me in because they still expect you in tonight. They also told me they didn't have a record for you staying tomorrow night either. The guy at the desk was rude so I decided to go elsewhere. You can call them to verify that I didn't stay there - hopefully they'll be more cooperative with you. The guy at the desk also told me that the reservation is non transferable but wouldn't tell me which employee was working on Wednesday which gave me (us?) wrong information when I called. Sorry it didn't work out - I called and left a message on your voicemail but can't wait any longer as I want to make sure I have a room tonight and have to be at an event in about an hour. So because it is non-refundable, I won't be seeing that money that was charged to my account. This is the worst, most unreliable service I have ever received from a hotel. DO NOT STAY HERE!

We did not expect the Ritz so were pretty much satisfied with all of it. We had a decent clean room for the night with two queen beds that were very comfortable. The room had a small refrigerator which was convenient to keep the drinks and sandwiches we had for the car trip. The bathroom was quite small, good shower. The carpet was worn in several places, and a few tears near the door. One strange thing was that most of the electrical outlets in the room seemed loose or something. Everytime we plugged in our chargers the plug fell out of the outlet. Only the bathroom outlets seemed to hold the plugs. Overall the place was quiet even though we were fairly close to the highway. Breakfast was a BIG disappointment. There was a half-used loaf of white bread, probably from the day before as we were in the room by 6 am when it opened. I was afraid to use the toaster. It looked old and dirty.The coffee was ok though only powdered creamer. There were no hot dishes - only some dry cereal. I did see some tiny packaged type muffins and some bananas and apples.

When I went to complain and asked to be moved, the female at the desk grudgingly did so. The only room left on the ground floor. The new room's A/C unit worked, but the tiolet did not. When we called the desk, she came down and \"fixed\" it. We went to dinner and I received a phone call that my husband was in an accident on our farm. My mother & sister informed the \"lady\" at the desk of this and they were informed that we would be charged for the room because she \"now had 2 rooms to clean because of us.\" Mine you, we were only in the 1st room for less than 5 minutes and in the 2nd room no more than 15 minutes total. If the 1st room would have been \"cleaned\" in the 1st place, we wouldn't have need to move!! Upon contacting the Corporate offiice, my mother was assured someone would investigate and call her back by July 3. NO ONE DID. She finally called them back and they said she will be charged since we went somewhere else.... Yeah. A hospital in Indianapolis, where my husband was taken after a tractor flipped on him. Never have I encounter such rude, nasty people. I'd rather sleep in my car!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago, il", "Title": "\u201cThe staff at the Super 8 is incredibly nice and accommadating!!\u201d", "Author": "chicagomona", "ReviewID": "UR31147519", "Content": "I travel every year from Chicago to Urbana-Champaign with 50-60 5th graders as part of their end of year field trip.

We stayed in Room 212 and it was gross. The tub was full of mildew, the towels all felt like sandpaper, and when I went to turn on the air conditioner, the door to the unit fell off, and the dials were rusted and unreadable. i went to plug in my phone charger by the nightstand and found a beer poptop under the nightstand and the walls were streaked with a brown substance, which looked like nicotine (Perhaps the room was a nonsmoking room at one time, but it was really gross).

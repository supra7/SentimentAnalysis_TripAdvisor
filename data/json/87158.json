I was a little hesitant ordering my bouquet without having a meeting to pick out what I would like, but after talking with Liz I felt very comfortable and confidant I made the right choice. Liz took the time to email and call me to discuss what I was looking for, she gave me several suggestions and recommendations that helped me decide exactly what I wanted. She was so sweet and helpful I could not asked for a better long distance experiance! I just had my wedding last week and was very satisfied with the end result.

The hotel is on the north side of the island, secluded from all the craziness of Honolulu and Waikiki beach. We rented a car, which I would strongly recommend, so moving around wasn't a problem at all. There is a good transit system, however, for less than $200 a week for a car rental, to us it was a no brainer. The hotel is nice, well kept and cared for. A bit updated, but the views....wow...the views. I would't care if I'd slept on the floor, the views and the beaches around the complex are absolutely stunning. Miles and miles of sandy beaches, with not a soul in site. That's why we chose this place. The restaurants are a bit pricey, so if you're on a budget, Costco or Walmart should be on your first stop. We stocked our fridge with breakfast stuff and booze, and we were good to go. Go figure, we're in the middle of the Pacific and still way cheaper than B.C.. For lunch, if you don't want to stay in the resort, the shrimp trucks are a good alternative. Just a short drive from the hotel, there's lots to choose from.If you're into golfing, then this is the definitely the place for you. Two courses to choose from, with incredible scenery. Night life is almost non-existent on the resort. There is a decent pub/bar/nightclub-The Surfer. The Polynesian cultural centre is only a 20 min drive, and IT'S A MUST. If you're planning to drive or transit it to Honolulu or Waikiki Beach, plan around rush hour, otherwise you'll be spending a good part of your well deserved vacation in traffic. Overall, if the resort has any issues, which by the way I had none, all you have to do is just look outside your balcony.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cWonderful honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "xzander1982", "ReviewID": "UR139820226", "Content": "We stayed at this resort on honeymoon and were there for ten days in all. The resort has a couple of golf courses but there is thankfully far more to this place than just golf. The local beaches and the facilities on site are second to none and you may find yourself staying there for days on end without needing or wanting to see the outside world. There are a huge amount of things to do here, even if you\u2019re not a golfer, with horse riding, helicopter rides, a spa, gym and surf lessons available. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed a bunch of stuff out but I just listed the things we did. The food is great \u2013 all the restaurants are worth trying at least once but I would especially recommend Lei Lei\u2019s next to the golf course for the tremendous food and friendly service. Ola is also quite incredible. The pool is really nice and the staff serving drinks and food were all really friendly and welcoming. Everyone seemed keen to put themselves out for us no matter how small the request. Prices - to my eyes - were reasonable, although we were paying with sterling which may have skewed my perspective. Our room was large, luxurious and spotless. At no point did we feel anything other than pampered and comfortable. Our view out to sea truly was beautiful \u2013 we got a grandstand view of some spectacular sunsets and also some incredible rainbows when the weather got unpredictable. It\u2019s an ideal location from which to explore the northern coast of the island \u2013 Honolulu and Waikiki are over an hours\u2019 drive though.

After being in Waikiki for the first half of our trip, it was great to escape for total relaxation at Turtle Bay. Our experience at this resort was quite good, but you have to go in knowing what to expect. If you are expecting modern luxury with 5-star attentive service, this is not the place for you. If you are looking to relax in \"old\" Hawaii with a laid back atmosphere in a beautifully peaceful setting, then Turtle Bay is the right choice. Upon arriving at the resort, the bell hops just sort of stood around and waved from their station. No warm aloha greeting to speak of. Check-in was just as cold. We've been more warmly and enthusiastically greeted at a standard Doubletree than we were here. A little disappointing and not what one would expect from a beach resort. We were given our keys and told where to park (the cottages have their own parking area) and off we went to schlep our own luggage and find our way to the cottage. Things changed for the better when our \"personal\" concierge arrived a few minutes after we settled in. He greeted us with some fruit and cold bottles of water, we chatted a bit and he shared some of the available amenities and history of the area. It's just too bad that the service wasn't more at this level from start to finish. Mostly the service was hit or miss during our stay depending on who you encountered. The cottages are set off from the main resort area and are definitely worth the extra cost. The rooms are certainly in need of some updating, but were still clean and comfortable, providing all of the amenities one would expect from a resort. The restroom had two sinks and a separate shower and soaking tub. There was plenty of counter space for two people. There is a sitting area leading to the lanai that is set a few steps down from where the beds are. It has a small sofa, coffee table, refrigerator, and a desk. The cottages are set just off of the water with a grassy area that leads right to them from the beach. We had a splendid view of the ocean and could enjoy this right from the room or from the lanai. My favorite spot was the hammock that hung just a few steps from our lanai. Housekeeping did a great job at cleaning the rooms, and they were always very friendly. The breakfast buffet was outstanding with offerings such as the standard breakfast fare/omlet station, fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, a variety of juices, along with some Japanese selections too. For those looking for a lighter breakfast, there is also a small coffee bar near the main lobby that offers a different selection of coffees, tea, cold cereal, pastries, and other snacks. We had all of our meals at the resort. Everything else was good, nothing great, just good. We also dined at the table from our lanai on our last night there. What a way to remember the North Shore - taking in the sunset while enjoying a meal just steps from the ocean. The spa services were pretty good, but not what I was expecting of a resort. It felt more like a salon type spa more than a beach resort spa. The massage was enjoyable, but nothing exceptional about the experience overall. Now the beach, oh the beach... Although somewhat small, it was near perfect. There were plenty of chairs and umbrellas and since it is within a small bay, it was perfect for swimming and snorkeling. We loved the beach and preferred it over the pool which was crowded and had lots of children running around. However, the pool bar is a great place to enjoy some drinks and lunch. It was fun to eat and watch as surfers bravely went up against the ominous waves on their boards. The grounds throughout were lush and well maintained. Breathtaking views can be had from almost anywhere you stand. There are plenty of places to stroll around and enjoy the natural beauty of the area. I would recommend taking the walk just south of the resort that goes past the horse corrals. It is a nature path along the shore that is just wonderful. We regretted not taking the horseback riding tour that is offered. Perhaps next time. We did do the helicopter tour that circled the entire island. This tour is available right from the hotel and is a short golf cart ride to the other side of the resort nearest the villas. The pilot was very professional and we enjoyed amazing views as we flew over the island. Overall, we enjoyed Turtle Bay and would definitely return with the hopes that some of the employees are better trained in providing resort quality service. This didn't really detract from our stay, but was slightly disappointing given the cost.", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful area and great location\u201d", "Author": "weenone", "ReviewID": "UR139669663", "Content": "This resort is fairly upscale, although older and the rooms (especially the bathrooms) need a little updating.

The pools are awesome and not at all crowded. Also great is the cove for swimming and a little snorkeling. We saw sea turtles at two locations on the resort. I recommend renting a car so you can see other area beaches and Haleiwa, a historic town just down the road. There is also a fruit stand on the road between the resort and Haleiwa that had great sliced mango and bags of assorted sliced fruit - I got to try fruit I normally wouldn't have. I also recommend eating at Ola, which is located on the beach. Their prices were more reasonable than other restaurants at the resort and the food and service were great. Also, shop at the store located on the pool level. I thought it would be expensive so avoided it at first, but when I did stop in I realized I'd been paying way too much in Haleiwa. The prices are great and they also sell alcohol so you don't have to hang out in the bars if you want a drink. In all, it was a fantastic trip.

Seeking a quiet, laid back alternative, I frantically called Turtle Bay and explained our situation to Kristen at the front desk. Kristen got us a room, albeit a double queen bed, and said she would hold our room till we got there. So we packed our suitcases (again) and headed North to Kahuka. We made it in under an hour and Kristen was there to greet us with open arms. Not only did she have a room held, but she managed to get us an ocean view room with a king sized bed...in less than an hour. She also promised to send up a bottle of champagne since it was our honeymoon. Compared to the service we were shown at the Hilton, this was a breath of fresh air. Since we arrived in the middle of night, we had no idea what the location looked like or what views we had. The room was large, had two sinks and a shower/tub. We had a good sized balcony where we heard the sound of the ocean. Each room has sliding doors that lead to your balcony. You also have the option to leave the door open and pull back these large wooden shutters. It was nice to sleep with doors open each night. When morning broke we were treated with gorgeous views of the ocean and perfect sunset photo ops. We were extremely happy with the pool, the nearby beaches and the food. The restaurants on the grounds are a bit pricey but thats expected for resort eats. There's plenty to do and see on TB property. Miles of hiking trails along the coast, horseback riding...etc. Hawaii's infamous shrimpmtrucks are about a mile away and made for some reasonably priced dining. Upon checkout, we told the front desk we had an extremely late flight. Theynallowed us to check out later in the day and even gave us use of a hospitality room so we could freshen up after utiling the beach and pool on our last day.

The lobby is nothing less than breathtaking and upon arrival, I knew I had made the right choice about staying here. Check in was friendly and quick and since an upgrade wasn't available, she said she'd give us the best room she had. We were on the 5th floor with no view obstruction overlooking the pool and ocean. It was truly beautiful. The room was in definetely need of a face lift - but I had read other reviews and was prepared for that that. The tiles were chipping in the bathroom and the paint really needs to be freshened up in the rest of the room, but otherwise it was fine. The safe was a nice size and the HUGE closet was a bonus! We ended up eating at the resort more than we expected to, due to the prices, but the food was exceptional and therefore, paying those prices didn't bother me too much. For breakfast we stuck with Lei-Lei's. It was cheap, fast, and everyone was so friendly. We weren't at the resort enough to enjoy all the amenities they have to offer, but we did do the 1 hr helicopter ride and it was amazing! Highly recommend it and Josh, the pilot, was great. The only other thing we were disappointed about, other than the rooms needing updated, was the parking situation. I would think that if you are paying to stay at such a place, there should be reserved parking for us whether you are staying at the hotel, villa or cottage. Just because we were staying at the hotel, we didn't have a reserved spot and ended up parking WAAAY at the end of the resort every day - regardless of the time we got back there. Bottom line - this is a wonderful place, with friendly staff.

These were the redeeming factors of our stay at Turtle Bay, however that was not enough to encourage us to return there in the future. The room was simply unacceptably outdated for a five-star resort. In fact, it was comparable to a motel room and often felt like one during our four-day stay there! I would not recommend this place for honeymooners who want a luxurious room to stay in- or to anyone who feels a nice washroom is essential for a restful stay, like ourselves.

It is truly beautiful and our room on the 6th floor had a balcony and a unmatched view of the sunset each night. If pounding surf keeps you up, close the glass door but we loved it. The rooms were clean, well kept and very comfortable. You can do anything you pretty much want to do at the resort but all of it comes with a price tag, and most of it is very expensive. We love Segways, they have them but compaired to tours in major citys that last 3 hours and cost around $70, here it was just 90 minutes for $100. I wanted to treat my wife to a spa treatment but with prices starting at $160, she would not hear of it. Happy hour does exsist but the island drinks are not included and are around $10 to $12 and something like a cheeseberger by the pool is $16. Coffee in the lobby each morning is there but at $3.50 a cup. It's a resort, it's Hawaii and it's expensive but if you want cheap, stay in the city at a motel. I'm not complaining, just be ready for lots of add on expenses. The on site restraunts are very good and again very expensive. It didn't matter as we just jumped in the car and within a couple of miles either way down the highway found some really great local places that were really fun. We had the buffet breakfast one morning and it was really good but it's inside, not all that special and to be honest, I've had better ones at resorts on Maui for the same price. The grounds were beautiful, we saw two weddings while we were there and what a wonderful place to get married. I don't know if we will ever go back, we had a great time but found we are not true resort people. Maybe if they had some kind of all inclusive deal or a much lower price but again, the place is great, maybe it's just not our kind of great. Nothing to do with this resort but locals on the North Shore are all in all very nice but they do have more than their share of \"Locals\" who make sure you know they are local and can make your trip less than wonderful. They'll have a nack for spotting rental cars and will break in and steal anything they can or just vandalize for the fun of it.

I\u2019m hard-pressed to think of an occasion at turtle bay when we didn\u2019t receive exceptional service.

Even despite the delays, it was an incredible experience I won\u2019t soon forget. We upgraded to a third floor room on the property\u2019s west side which included a full deck and an ocean view where we could see the magnificent sunsets. I was a little turned-off by the roof located two floors below and which extends out several hundred square feet. For aesthetic purposes, it\u2019s covered with volcanic red rock, but it was also littered with cups and cans, champagne corks and other debris. One important benefit to our room location, however, was that it was well insulated from ground noise. We were situated away from the pools and restaurant, and foot traffic, but we were still able to hear the ocean off in the distance. The walls were well insulated, almost concrete-like, but you could hear luggage and chairs in the floor above us. One other huge plus to our room was the quiet air conditioner! No window/wall mounted unit that clunks in the middle of the night. That drives me nuts! Nothing here is cheap, so prepare yourself. The convenience of room charges may result in sticker shock at the time of check out - so consider yourself warned. That said, though, I think it was fair value for a first trip.

We had a wonderful time at turtle bay! We booked a basic ocean view room that was on the lowest floor intending to upgrade but the hotel was at 90% capacity ( although didnt seem it) so weren't able to, but I actually liked being closer to the water. I thought not having a balcony would be an issue, but they have huge glass door that opens and you can listen to the waves and the view was amazing! The rooms were remodeled and were nice, the bathroom was a little dated but not dirty or anything. A few people mentioned the smell was musty but we didn't experience that at all. The beds were comfortable, we couldnt sleep late though due to the wood blinds didnt block the sun, i would definitely bring eye wear if thats a problem for you. Every room has an ocean view and we loved ths fact. It was also cool to see the surfers and i definitely would have learned had i not been pregnant. We rented a car at thrifty and was really cheap for the week ($197 without insurance), we got a dodge caliber and was perfect for the week. The north shore is far away from everything so you definitely have to rent a car for the best experience. We enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and turtle bay was very relaxed, more romantic, and felt secluded. I would recommend taking the ocean view highway route on the way to the resort and around the island, the ocean views never get old. FYI speeds here are very slow, we Dallas drivers had a hard time with this (35 mph). We never ate the resort buffet because didn't want to spend $25 bucks a person per day on breakfast, instead went most days to the fresh fruit stand a mile or so down the road. The fruit is. Fresh, cut up, cheap and amazing! Also tried Teds bakery and the donuts and pastries were pretty awesome, plus they have hot food to order and Prices were also reasonable. We did eat at the surfer bar the first night we were there and was decent, but 20 bucks for a personable pizza was high, I got the sushi which was good. Thy have karaoke in the bar which was entertaining. I would recommend the lai making at the resort, beautiful flowers, 5 bucks a person but you have to sign up in advance. I did get a prenatal massage which was not worth the $180 I paid for it. It was decent, but not as good as expected. We did take the nature trail and, although didn't see any turtles, had a great morning walk and enjoyed our little private beach. One of the excursions we did was the Mai Tai sunset cruise which was very reasonable (35 pp) and all you can drink Mai tais on tap which my husband took advantage of. We got great pictures of diamond head on the cruise. Our FAVORITE thing to do was the Chiefs Luau at Sea Life park! It is definitely worth the money and the chief makes everyone feel welcome, gets the crowd engaged. I would get there early so you can take advantage of the free extras, we got sidetracked and was late taking pictures of the amazing cliffs on the way there. I cannot say enough about the chief and the fire show was AMAZING!!! We also went to pearl harbor which was a good experience but takes all day, we did a lot of sight seeing, went to Waikiki a few days which is busy but good shopping. We also went to waimena falls which is $7 pp to get in, water really cold, but the waterfall was beautiful.

It was for our honeymoon so we were hyped to stay there. Keep in mind, this review is coming from people who have stayed in European hostels- our expectations were high because we paid a lot of money for the service we thought we'd be getting. Yes, movies and tv have been filmed there, and as native New Yorkers, we know a lot of set design is used to transform places- it seems they used a lot of movie magic to make this place nice. First off, we had an ocean view room- the balcony was covered in bird droppings, the bed creaked everytime we moved, the pillows smelled like mold, and the sheets were stained. My absolute favorite part of the room was the awful shutters used to keep the sun out. Not so much- they were broken, paint was peeling off everywhere, and they did not serve a purpose as the sun woke us up every morning. A 4 star resort can't invest in black out shades like you'd find at any run of the mill hotel? Come on. The lamps didn't work, the phone was broken, the tv remote was broken, the AC vent was covered in dust, the room smelled like mold and mildew, and it was an awful color green. The bathroom was a real delight as well- the shower curtain- yes, curtain-did nothing to keep the water in- we had a lake every time after showering all over the beautifully chipped floor. Even small details like the soap holder and tissue box holder looked like they were purchased from a fire sale that an old motel 6 had in 1974. The food was terrible. The restaurants were completely over priced. Here's the clincher- there is a serious fruit fly infestation in Leonardo's- the spot of the daily breakfast buffet. I work in hospitality in New York, I know fruit flies mean disaster in the kitchen. I was so disgusted by it. They put citronella candles in the fruit display to try and keep them away- real classy. What happens then? They form a colony on the disgustingly dirty windows that haven't been washed in years. I find it truly amazing that my husband and I could walk the grounds and keep track of what improvements need to be made but the management hasn't. There are so many more complaints, but why bother listing them- from what management has responded to previous complaints here it seems they keep sayin the same thing- \"come back after we renovate\" no thank you. We took photos of all the items listed here, so it's all true, and can be backed up. Stay at the Marriott in Ko Olina- we did for a few days prior and it was amazing....

Now the bad: rooms are in desperate need of updates, and carpets could use some cleaning, there are mini fridges, but no microwaves anywhere that we could find. No children's menus anywhere either. And no DVD players, which is a must for a family with kids. We also had some issues with the room, the first room we where in had some sort of generator or something in it, and shook the entire wall on one side of the bed, te noise was unbearable. The front desk was very apologetic, moved us rooms and have us complementary breakfast vouchers. The new room was clean and ready for us that afternoon, but the air conditioning was having issues and every night we where surprised by a flowing stream dripping out of the air conditioner. It happened 3 nights in a row. And the room never seemed to cool off. They also charge for EVERYTHING, put stuffed animals in your room and charge you if tountake them, or put bottles of water on the counter eith a tiny sighn that says they are $3 each. No beach umbrellas eaither. That being said, we enjoyed the lei making and pony ride, as well as the complementary snorkeling and beach area. If we come back we will probably be renting a vacation home, and will probably not come back here.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake city", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "erinbabyblue23", "ReviewID": "UR137027229", "Content": "The only reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hotel rooms themselves are a tad outdated for the price you pay to stay there.

The problem was that I had to pay $50 to use one of their cots for 3 nights. If they can't give you what you requested 3 months prior, I feel they should give the cot for free. Having said that, there is NOTHING else negative I can say about this place. Although the rooms were a bit outdated, they were still nice and clean and every other part of the hotel was gorgeous.

We hired a car the next day from enterprise who Re based at resort but we could not leave it at the airport so we had the return taxi fare as well. Definitely get a car if you want to see the island.

I have visited the north shore of O'ahu several times before and it is one of the most beautiful pieces of coastline in the world so I was excited to be staying here. What I was presented with was a slightly dated looking sixties hotel which seemed very corporate and impersonal and soul-less. The reception staff were very efficient but were not particularly welcoming and it was clear I was more a number to them rather than an individual. It doesn't cost anything to smile once in a while! I paid for a Deluxe Oceanfront room which was significantly more expensive than the standard rooms. The room was good quality in general and was well kept and clean, although just like my first impressions of the hotel, it was a little dated (particularly the bathroom which really needed a refurbishment). The room has everything you would expect from a resort hotel and has modern amenities in general. The balcony was worth paying extra for to sit out in the sun, but the views were disappointing - yes, I could see the sea, but I could also see a litter-strewn flat roof below. The cheaper rooms which didn't have a balcony appeared to have a better view. Wi-fi, parking and room safe were all included in the price of the room which was good. Everything else was an extra such as bottled water ($3 for a 300ml bottle - outrageous!) and even a toy fish left on the bed ($20). The complimentary bottle of chilled champaign left in the room upon our return from dinner was a nice surprise though! Foodland supermarket is a short drive down the road and great for getting a picnic to sit on the beach and watch the sunset. It also sells bottled water at approximately 1/4 of the price of the hotel water. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and very well manicured and the groundkeeping staff obviously work very hard to maintain them. The pools are small but well kept and the resort did not seem overcrowded which was really good. If you're looking for a resort hotel, then you won't have any problems here but European resort hotels are of a better standard and are far more welcoming.

We were looking for a true getaway for relaxation and we knew we wanted to avoid staying in busy Honolulu. This is our third time in Hawaii, having vacationed on Kauai and Maui previously. Though this was our first time on Oahu, we loved this stay. My wife and I agree the north shore of Oahu is our new favorite in Hawaii. Don't be deterred by people who say it's SO far from Honolulu; the drive is really not bad. Just far enough to feel like you're away from the city, but only like a 45 minute drive. We did the drive around to visit Honolulu/Pearl/Waikiki several times while sight-seeing on this trip with three young children in the SUV with us, and never had to deal with the \"are we there yet's\". Turtle Bay is in a great location on the north shore. The first time you drive up there, you do start to wonder just how far it is until you get there. But, once you're there, the drive doesn't seem bad at all. The resort is well located close to several awesome beaches and is also only a short drive from the Polynesian Cultural Center. And, they do have abundant activities on-site for those who dont want to have to drive. There are several better dining options on-site, but I have to admit that we didn't really spend much time eating in this property's restaurants. A few snacks and drinks around the pool. We did do Sunday buffet brunch which though pricey had about every food choice you could want. And really, the price there was pretty comparable to other experiences we've had in Hawaii. If you are flexible and willing to try some less formal dining, there are also several good convenient and affordable meal options on the north shore. Of course, try the shrimp trucks. Our experience - service there can be SLOW but the food is decent. WE LOVE TED's BAKERY. This place is absolutely the best for quick tasty meals; the breakfast pasteries are awesome and the lunch & dinner plate were tasty and filling, we used this place over and over again. Back to discussing Turtle Bay, we can't say enough good things about the beach cottages at Turtle Bay. We read several negative comments about rooms in the main hotel building but only positives about the beach cottages; a really good internet rate on the beach cottages tempted me and got me to book - SO glad that I did. Can't comment on the rooms in the main building, but the beach cottages are AWESOME. Very nice rooms. We had two adults and three young children into one of these cottages. Never felt crouded. Very comfortable. Can't beat the view from the lanai, andt the hammocks are wonderful. The beach is literally twenty steps from the beach cottage lanais. Also, the cottages conveniently have a nice sized refrigerator in them which we used to full advantage; our advice, there are grocery stores on the main road travelling in either direction around the island from Turtle Bay. Stop and shop for the basics if you're looking to save money on dining. This was HUGE for us with three little kids. I can say we will ABSOLUTELY be staying here again, the next time we visit Oahu.

The workout room is small, but you can yake your yoga mat or exercise ball outside on the adjoining terrace and enjoy a fantastic view while you work. You have beaches on either side of the resort- one for surfing and one for snorkeling/ swimming.

Me and my wife loved the lobby and all the private beaches you can relax, as well as the banyan trees and the hiking trails, the seaside couples massage is definetly a must, especially if you have never have had a massage like my wife, the pool is nice and needs no updating, we had a pikake jr suite and it was big and spacious, the view was the best I have ever had, only a few concerns though, I had put in the notes of our reservation that it was our honey moon and I thought they would do something nice the day we got to the hotel but nothing was set up, bit of a disappointment, I was told about the resort fee but was not told about the 900 dollar hold they put on the card for any services that we would be using, this is not good if you were going to pay cash for everything like us, but the lobby staff was nice the girl at night helped us out and only put a 150 dollar hold on the card instead of 900! I forgot her name but I noticed she is the evening shift there, the parking well like the other reviews does need some improvement, at least some reserve Parking for hotel guests, the Italian restaurant is nice and had good pasta and steaks, ola by the beach was not bad, my wife didn't like it too much though, was very nice to sit on the sand by the water though, prices are a bit expensive all over Hawaii except for local eateries, teds is a must go, the omelletes are big to serve 2 people! Me and my wife got one for each the first day and then shared the rest of the days, good pricing, and the chocolate cupcakes are a must there as well, my wife had one every morning. We never had the buffet at the palm restaurant because me and my wife aren't much of big eaters (I eat very healthy, she doesn't but she doesn't eat much) so we ordered from the menu, food was very good and my wife said that the hot chocolate was the one of the best she had ever drank, I tried it and must admit from a person that puts Splenda in these drinks I didn't have to! LOL, the bathrooms in the rooms are very spacious I just think some need a nice tub, it could definitely fit, another place that is good is by halewai I forgot the name but it' was right next to the breakers restaurant, staff there was very good, we are from Miami so we didn't really want to stay by Waikiki and thank god we didn't when we drove there one of the days it looked just like south beach, didn't want to travel so far to be just like home, the Mexican restaurant by Waikiki is pretty good as well, I think it was called la cucaracha, the luau at the PCC was not worth it, food was not good and the show a bit boring we left at the intermission, maybe paradise cove is better, from what I heard, it is, and they give food while the show is going on not some cafeteria style food and then a show on the other side and then you tend to fall asleep, kuoloa ranch is a must if you love lost and movies, we wanted to get the KOS tours but they were booked, so we got the horse back ride 2 hour, it was a nice experience, we also did the grand circle island tour in the big island for one day 720 bucks for 2 people, wouldn't recommend it, you don't stay long enough in the places, next time we are definitely booking the flights on our own and just rent a car there and go wherever we want to go!

The staff promptly brought an air mattress for the daughter which worked out well. The cottage was beautiful and sparklingly clean, featuring hardwood floors, marble bath, and very high ceiling. The minibar was well stocked and the prices were quite reasonable relatively speaking. There was a VERY well stocked sundries shop next to the pool with an impressive liquor, beer, and soda selection, lots of snacks, thorough OTC pharmacy and toiletry selection, as well as beach mats, hats, surf shoes, magazines, and so on. We never felt the need to visit Foodland to stock up. I don't think it matters much which cottage you get, the good and less good (there are no bad) features balance out. If you are in a cottage close to the water/hotel, people walk right in front of your patio. If you are on the far end away from the hotel, you have more privacy and less noise but a significant walk to the hotel. We were ecstatic with our cottage in the mid section a little farther from the water with lots of manicured lawn and several hammocks to choose from. We took surfing lessons which were the highlight of our trip. The entire crew at HH was always fun, pleasant and helpful...you can tell they love what they do. But special thanks to our instructor Mikey who had us riding all the waves we could catch from the very beginning as first timers. I suggest booking your surf lessons in advance, because if the hotel is full you are not likely to be able to walk up and join even a group lesson. If you can book a semiprivate lesson that is the way to go for sure. The golf facility is outstanding. They have new Titlist equipment for rental with one reasonable fee for the whole week, and a very nice practice area. Both courses were in excellent condition and had amazing views; Fazio is the easier track by far. The greens were lush with NO ballmarks and so they roll very true. The wind was a significant factor all 3 days I played, usually around 20 MPH, sometimes more. I booked a tee time the first day but after that just showed up and was off with no wait. We also enjoyed the sunset horseback ride, the wonderful tennis courts, the spa, the sunset music and drinks at Hang 10, and the excellent restaurants. I'm not sure which version of Ahi Poke I enjoyed more, Lei Lei's or Ola's, so I'm going to have to come back for more research. The steaks were surprisingly great at both places, with the nod to Lei Lei's. The creme brulee at Ola's was as good as I have ever had. The breakfast buffet in the hotel was excellent. The prime rib and seafood buffet at Leonardo's was not as good. The coffee and pastry bar in the hotel lobby is great if you don't need a full breakfast. The self-serve coffee provided in the cottage was satisfactory but rather weak...the stronger coffee with espresso shot option at the hotel was worth the walk. Special praise for the outstanding room service is deserved...delivery was quick and the quality was very good. The several beaches on the property were excellent. The towel card system worked well. The grounds were beautiful and well-maintained, we saw turtles frolicking in the water right across from our cottage, and we enjoyed playing with the few cats that roam the area. I do wish the staff was better able to enforce their posted smoking restrictions, but smokers tend to be more motivated and determined than any staff could ever be to stop them, so I understand the difficulties. This is a large well-run resort with a great variety and quality of activities that should please anyone in the family whether they want to partake in sports or just chill.

We'd find a spot - snorkle or body surf on a beach completely to ourselves. Where else could you sit on a rock and watch a giant sea turtle rolling in the surf along the shore - popping his head up every once in a while to make sure we were still watching? The rooms were fine - clean and comfortable. The restaurants were no more pricey than you'd find anywhere else - and the food was fantastic. Pack your lunches and sit at the beach for an inexpensive - but priceless afternoon. Take advantage of the refrigerators in the rooms and stop at Foodland for basics and sushi made on the spot. The farm stand just south of the resort has amazing pineapple, mango, coconut, dragon fruit, watermelon and papaya fresh cut and in bags for $ 2.00. Perfect breakfast! Shrimp trucks line the Highway on the east - worth the drive to the Shrimp Shack - a truck owned by a woman from Orland Park, IL. Great! However, Turtle Bay no longer has the Friday night Luau.

We were very pleased with our accommodations at Turtle Bay Resort. We chose to stay in one of the beach cottages and this was an excellent choice. The beach cottages made you feel like you were sort of in a private cottage instead of a large resort. The rooms were kept spotless and the concierge service was great. Fresh fruit was delivered to our room daily as well as the newspaper and each night turn down service was provided which also included delivery of chocolate macadamia nuts packaged in a pretty box each evening. Although the room was a little farther from the beach than expected, the views were superb and we could watch the sunset from our lanai as well as the turtles frolicking in the ocean. The water nearest the room was a little too rough for swimming and snorkeling unless you are an excellent swimmer and I would not recommend swimming for children. The pool area is in need of an upgrade but was okay. It gets very windy on the pool deck so bring towel clips or something heavy to sit on top of your towel to keep it from blowing away. The service poolside was okay, not great. I had to flag someone down whenever we needed service which is surprising as the prices were high. I would expect much better service than was provided. Also, the pool seems to be closed down fairly often. This occurred twice during our stay during prime time pool hours due to a \"chemical imbalance\". The restaurants are pricey. We tried Leonardo's. It was okay, not great. We also had lunch at the Hang Ten. It was also okay but way overpriced. We chose to dine offsite for the rest of our meals but be prepared to drive 10-20 minutes if you choose this option. I highly recommend Ted's Bakery for breakfast. They have fabulous omelettes, egg sandwiches, and baked goods. I also recommend Impossibles for pizza. It sounds crazy but it is pizza out of a food truck. You have to call on the day you want it as it travels to different locations on the North Shore daily but it was great and the proprietor was super nice and it was possibly the best pizza I've had (definitely the best pizza I've had in Hawaii).

We were actually blown away when we arrived. Check in was a breeze, friendly staff took care of our car and our luggage while we sat there soaking in that amazing lobby view. Our room (625, top floor, fourth from the right on the right section of the property) wasn't super fancy but that's not why we decided to come here, we wanted to explore and get lost in Oahu. Oh yeah, shampoo keeps coming up in these reviews. All we did was call and ask for more and someone showed up 5 minutes later with a like 8 each of shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, etc so I'm not sure why some of you guys had problems. It was clean and the only complaints I could maybe muster was that the carpet was kind of beat up, but with people tracking sand EVERYWHERE 24/7 I imagine that might be tough to manage. The sliding door was too heavy for my wife to operate, but no biggie there. Speaking of the sliding door... the view we woke up to every morning was amazing, our Lanai overlooked the lagoon side of the property. We are torn on which side we want to be on when we go back, as you can't see a sunset from the rooms on that side of the building, but you have the lagoon view. Hmm, first world problems, right? We had seen how Waikiki is and did NOT want that. We didn't fly halfway around the world to hang out on a crowded beach with reserved seating. There was only one time I felt a little crowded during our entire trip and that was when a famous surfer was scheduled for an appearance at surfer the bar. It was kind of hard to find parking as locals were parked absolutely everywhere. No-Parking Curbs? Grass? On a tree? Pick one, or all three. Speaking of bars. Justin! I was happy to see another couple mention his name as I imagine we are not the only couples he has helped before. Justin was extremely friendly and helped us decide on a few different activities to do around the island. He showed (and wrote us directions!) some pictures from some of the amazing views on various hikes around Oahu so we could make up our minds on which ones to tackle. Someone give that guy a raise. As far as activities around the resort go, they definitely have a variety. Every morning after breakfast our room would be made and there would be a large flyer with the schedule of activities for the day and special pricing for certain things. Not sure why others were complaining about being unaware of what there was to do as we had no complaints. Totally recommend doing a helicopter tour. Shannon and Pilot Bob were great and decided to upgrade us to a longer flight due to scheduling and an issue with the intercoms on the rear seats where we couldn't hear the pilot. Next time we're definitely going to try out surfing, it was pretty cool watching the instructors out there working with others all morning, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Breakfast buffet was included in our deal otherwise we probably would have skipped it. There was ample selection and a chef on hand to make fresh eggs and omletes, which was really nice. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants on the property since there's so many local choices minutes away to the west in Haleiwa (Luibuenos was a Justin suggestion, great food!) and to the East (Giovanni's Shrimp Truck & Fiji Market).

We thoroughly enjoyed the hang 10 bar in the evenings with lots of entertainment of local origin. The food in most of the restaurants was quite expensive and very similar across the resort. We most enjoyed Lei Lei's (bar and grill at the golf course on the resort) and Ola's restaurant (in front and outside the hotel on the beach), preferring these than the restaurants within the hotel, we also felt these were the most value for money.

The service at Turtle Bay is good, but I would not call it great -- although we did not have to wait too long to check in; it still seemed too long. Our questions were all answered during our stay but did seem to have to know what to ask -- some resort activities (like Hawaiian games) seemed to only take place after we insisted (despite the published schedule). Still, the views and the joys of the Northern shore and the beauty of the hotel made all that seem very minor.

We have been to Hawaii 25 or 30 times over the last 45 years and stayed at all of the Oahu resorts - The Kahala, the Moana, the Halekulani, the JW Marriott, the Royal Hawaiian, etc. This time, we started at the Royal Hawaiian on Waikiki. We love Waikiki and all that it has to offer, but decided to spend our last four days on the north shore. We had never before stayed over there because it just seemed too remote. On recent past trips we had visited the Turtle Bay Resort for the day - before its facelift - and it just did not stack up with our plans and expectations. On future trips, it will absolutely be part of our itinerary. We were extremely impressed. The location, ambience and gracious hospitality reminded me of Hawaii in the 60's. The aloha spirit still lives on Waikiki, but the laid back, uncrowded atmosphere at Turtle Bay was a great way to end our trip. We got our Waikiki fix and wound down on the north shore before the trip home. The golf courses at Turtle Bay are all you could ask for - one by Fazio and the other by Palmer. The course conditions and layout were excellent. Although we did not play tennis, the courts were first class. Bike rentals, horse rentals and snorkeling are all within walking distance. The pool area has a full size pool, a pool and slide for kids. My wife likes to swim laps and it is plenty big for that. The food was great. We have done all of the big name restaurants in Honolulu. Lei leis at the Turtle Bay golf center was the best meal we had for this 10 days. We stayed in one of the beach cottages. It exceeded our expectations. Again, it brought back memories of the old resorts like the Cocoa Palms on Kauai or the Mauna Kea in the 60s and 70s. Lastly, the staff was without exception extraordinarily gracious and committed to the aloha spirit. It was very genuine and sincere. Now I'm not saying that we are giving up Waikiki but Turtle Bay will now be part of our Oahu plans. Whether just the two of you or the whole family, I think you will like Turtle Bay if you like good food, a beautiful location, deluxe accommodations and an active lifestyle - at prices that deliver excellent value.

It's also well located on the North Shore, just minutes from the shrimp trucks (Giovanni's garlic scampi has no peer!) in one direction, and Ted's Bakery in the other, and only 15-20 minutes from the charming town of Haleiwa. We stayed here for 10 days in July, and the weather was mixed - lots of wind ever day of course, but also a fair amount of rain and frequent grey skies. We stayed in a 3br villa, which was very spacious and comfortable for our family of 5. The villas seem to be very popular with families with young kids (ours are teens) because there is a warm pool/hot tub right there, for the exclusive use of the villas, and you're just steps to the swimming cove, so it's very easy to keep the kids entertained. I wish I'd known, though, that the villas were really basically condos with linen service - there's no bar at the villa pool and no music/entertainment that far from the hotel. It felt more like a house rental than a resort stay. Other 'cons' include: the food selection is limited for a longer stay, and very expensive; other than Ola (on the beach - our fave place to eat) the restaurants had outdated decor and were consistently over-air-conditioned - bring a cardigan; there is no food or drink service on the beach; the lobby is open and echoey, so car noise mingles with wheelie luggage noise and bar music when you are trying to enjoy a cup of coffee or cocktail in the lobby lounge; all the cultural activities (lei making, uke lessons) are done in the lobby, which is awkward and a bit odd considering the gorgeous outdoor setting; and there are no Kids Club or teen activities offered.

The lobby shots alone in the movie sold us. We had to go there! We went for 7 nights 8 days in February. And while we were there Elizabeth Smart apparently got married and was actually staying on the same floor as us. Kinda crazy. Now after I booked the trip I was on here (trip advisor) looking at reviews and got completely nervous about the room and grounds because there are people on here that gave bad reviews on anything and everything. I was freaking out. But to my pleasant surprise I was glad I trusted my gut. We had an amazing time and Turtle Bay is a true Hawaiian experience. If you would like a very honest review, please read my somewhat winded reviews below on all aspects of the hotel and stay: 1. The Hotel Grounds/Location Be prepared that this hotel is way up on the North shore. I want to say it took about 45-to 1hr to get there from the airport. It is not close to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki beach. Its definitely more secluded and on its own. But thats the experience my husband and I wanted. We went down to the Waikiki beach area while on a tour to pick up some other passengers and we were so glad we chose to stay on the North shore. It was way too much like any other city with chain stores etc. Turtle Bay in the north shore is peaceful, beautiful and you can really enjoy nature. The grounds of the hotel are really impeccable and clean. So many beautifully manicured plants etc. My husband and I just walked around upon first arrival and took everything in. Theres little outcomes where you can stand closer to the rocks and even a rock type peninsula that you can walk out (at your own risk) and get some great pics. There are also a few trails to walk on the Turtle Bay property (as well as an amazing golf course but we didn't play!, next time!) My husband and I walked to the Baynan trees and private beaches along the property. We are big Lost fans and these Baynan trees were part of the show, so it was an added perk to staying there. Pool area was were we spent a lot of time. Yes its a family resort so there are kids. I definitely saw about 20 prego chicks walking around. Most likely on babymoons. There were some kids in the pool occasionally but nothing that annoyed us. Everything was very relaxing which we were surprised. 2. Room It is definitely true that every room has a ocean view. I forget what floor we were on. But we were on a higher floor. We had an Ocean Deluxe Room so we had a balcony that we could sit out on if we wanted (but I am afraid of birds so I wasn't out there too much). CON: Theres no screen door, Just the glass slider. So me being paranoid of birds didn't want to leave the door open to listen to the waves at night because I was paranoid. But I found the room decor to be up to date and stylish and very clean. And Im a fashion designer by trade, I would know if the rooms weren't up to date! To be honest we weren't in the room all that much, but it was very nice. The hotel room is for sleep, you should be out enjoying hawaii! I have attached some photos. The bathrooms were a little meh. They definitely could use some updating but its nothing we minded really. 3. Hotel Restaurants Olas-My favorite. We ate at a table on the beach. Everything was so great. And I remember their bread dipping sauce was amazing. It was casual but upscale at the same time. The hostess' weren't that friendly but the wait staff was attentive and we had some great food. My fish was local and fresh! so good. Lei Lei's-Great casual restaurant on the golf course. We ate dinner here and it definitely had all the golf crowd. Food and service was great. Pool Bar-We ate lunch here a lot. Fish tacos were great! A little pricey, we realized we were better off eating local food for lunch which was much cheaper. Lobby Bar-This is a coffee/breakfast place in the mornings that serves coffee and muffins etc. then a bar at night. Shot out to our favorite bartender JUSTIN! He was amazing. I will say the Mai Tais we got the first night were amazing. And super strong. But there after they definitely got weaker, not just here just throughout the resort. I think because it was our first night they made them extra strong! But Justin was great with tips on where to go and introduced us to some great Hawaiian beer that we can get in CT. We did the breakfast buffet one day because I wanted to try it, but its honestly not worth the price unless you are gonna really EAT. 4. Spa This was our highlight. The spa was amazing. We booked a couples massage in the little hut on the ocean. Hearing the waves crash the rocks as a 6'5\" Hawaiian man gave me a deep tissue massage, oh yeah. Paradise! My husband was there too, but he had a lady and we both were in heaven. We got to go use the sauna etc. afterwards and it was a nice relaxing day. Overall our stay was great. I think next time we would love to stay in the cottages and just lounge on the hammocks and porches in that area. We just weren't paying for the stay so we didn't want to over extend my husbands parents on their budget. But we did have to pay for everything else. Unfortunately Hawaii doesn't really have all inclusives. It would have been way more amazing if we didn't end up spending 3,000 dollars on food and excursions, but with that said, it was still amazing. The North shore is amazing and so is turtle bay. Don't listen to bad reviews. Unless you are Madonna and need things to be gold plated, then you should enjoy your time here :) You get a true Hawaiian experience. Other Tips: 1. All beaches are public so the parking lot at turtle bay does get packed with locals using the public beach. We rented a car and had to circle a lot of time to find a spot. 2. Try the local foods and food trucks-Shrimp trucks!!! Giovannis is amazing. 3. If you are on the north shore, you need to rent a car to get around and visit local stuff. There are fruit stands 2 minutes away from the hotel that are great and its abut 15 minute drive to Haleweia (forgive my spelling), which is a cute little surfer town. 4. Take a ride to Waimea Falls, great nature park and waterfall 5. If you are LOST fans like us, KOS tours is the only tour you need. You get to see Hawaii and all the cool shooting locations!!!", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cYou have no other option on the North Shore\u201d", "Author": "mforr002", "ReviewID": "UR134460804", "Content": "The grounds of the hotel are very nice.

Given that this is the ONLY hotel on the North Shore, it would be nice if they updated everything, but I suppose since they have no competition, there is no incentive. You can get a vacation rental home on the North Shore cheaper than this hotel.

That being said, I usually brush off bad visits and never comment, and let the good ones stand on their own, but my recent stay at this hotel was almost absurd it was so infuriating... The positives...the location...which I can really only give credit to mother nature for since the staff nor the builders really have any control over that whatsoever. The grounds are well cared for, and the scenery is pretty for oahu, but its pretty remote so if you're into nightlife you better hope to have a car, and if you're young and like to go out then expect several lengthy taxi rides. The Staff at the pool bar Hang Ten, were absolutely awesome, can't say enough about those guys, friendly, informative and most of all attentive. The Bad: Service...Service...Service... This place made me wonder if I was the subject of some unwitting Truman Show were secretly people all over the world were watching me on candid camera as each dining or bar experience at this place enraged me. First waitress forgot half of our order, never brought us additional drinks, was dancing behind the bar for like 20 minutes and then lied to us about how the bus boy should have brought us everything we ordered...well its hard for him to bring us the food if you never rang it up on the bill (which she handed to me as she realized half our order never made it to the table). Secondly, and perhaps most hysterical, 30 minutes later we wanted to grab a few drinks to take outside for the fireworks. We walked to the lobby bar where another waitress insisted that we sit down while she whip us up a few drinks real quick for us to take out there...now i stressed I didn't want to sit down and we were in a hurry but she politely convinced me all would be well...seconds later the fireworks began and the waitress I swear to god said \"fireworks!! I'm going to watch\" and proceeded to run outside leaving us dumbfounded. Aside from about 4 other visits in which we had to wait on average 25 minutes for a waiter to approach our table, the icing on the cake was when my girlfriend got food poisoning from their restaurant 21 degrees on our final night and spent the entire evening vomiting. The next morning I called the concierge to inform them of this just so they could check their stock of food and prevent them from serving it to anyone else. In return they requested I fill out a security complaint form and turn it in upon checkout, which I was happy to do. At checkout, I'm not sure why I expected anything, but I hoped at least for an apology. Which I did not receive, instead I received a look of disbelief as if their top restaurant could have possibly done that (which reminded me my 45 dollar rib eye was also nearly charred to a crisp so don't think your crap doesn't stink). We didn't receive an apology, charges removed from our bill or anything. Perhaps I'm wrong to think this should be in order but every other hotel I've stayed at, even the normal 4 star hotels would have gone out of their way to ensure everything was fine. As for the rooms, they were ok, nothing really too spectacular. We had a room with a balcony which I enjoyed while she was puking all evening/morning. Can't really bash the rooms since they are about what you would expect unless staying at a four seasons, mandarin, st regis (which i highly recommend for kauai), or ritz class level hotel . In the likely event anyone has actually read this far I would say that this place is just going to cause you more headaches than its worth, the service sucks, the food sucks, the beach is a lagoon, the pool is nice, but usually swamped since its really the only place on the North Shore, my suggestion would be to go straight to Kauai. But since I would also likely ignore this review based on other previous positive comments, if you do end up staying at this hotel, make sure you spend every meal at the pool bar, those guys were awesome.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cI want to come back!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ErinandCraig123", "ReviewID": "UR133986165", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights for the first part of our honeymoon in December 2011.

Luckily enough for us we were able to check into our villa already! We couldn't believe our luck and couldn't be more thankful. The staff were friendly and helpful - they carried our bags and took us to our villa in a golf cart. We stayed in an ocean view villa. It was gorgeous and the water was only a few metres away from our outdoor area. The sunsets were particularly amazing. We received complimentary champagne and juice. Its a big resort but where we stayed it was pretty quiet. We didn't really do any activities at the resort as we were still recovering from jet lag the whole time we were here. The pool looked amazing and they supply your towels but we didn't use this either as it was a bit too cold. Unfortunately at the time we were there reception was being renovated so the big glass window you see on the website and in Forgetting Sarah Marshall was covered but I can imagine how beautiful it would usually be.

After our first few days in Waikiki, this place was the perfect two-thirds of our Oahu vacation. Got rather windy most days, but that meant staying cool even in the sun on the beach. It also meant our horse ride in the hills was cool, not hot and humid as it could have been. Overall, we all (including two teenagers) loved the place - good rooms and beds, good food and lots of activities. Definitely need a car to get around, or you'd be stuck at the resort the whole time (nothing within walking distance except the bus stop). We travel a lot (5-6 times a year), and this place definitely gets an unconditional recommendation. Details: Room/facilities - we had an Oceanfront deluxe, which meant a large room plus a good sized lanai (balcony), on the 5th floor - great view, though we overlooked the roof of their conference facilities. The wind kept us cool, and we left our sliding doors open with the A/C of the whole time we were there - closest thing to sleeping in the open you can get, while still on a comfy bed. I saw some reviews that called the rooms \"desperately in need of renovations\", that left us saying \"huh?\" when we got our room. Yes, there were a couple of things that looked quite dated (the 70s era soap and sundries dishes in the bathroom, for example), but the room was in excellent shape overall - the only obvious sign we could see was some rust on the A/C vent cover in the ceiling, but given that we were leaving the doors open, probably like everyone else, I can imagine the constant salty, humid air playing havoc on stuff like that. One nice feature was two sinks - one in the little dressing area so it made it easier for the 4 of us to get ready quickly. This should be a standard feature in resorts catering to families, but sadly is not that common. The grounds were very well maintained (though my wife the gardener remarked that she had expected more flowers), and it was pretty easy to get around to the main spots (pool, beach, restaurants). Again, for the people who've complained its quite a walk, the size of the grounds is a key attraction - this is not a typical Waikiki hotel that takes up its entire lot with a building, and everything is inside the building. The beach was a nice lagoon-style affair, with some basic snorkeling right there. On the other side of the resort is a rougher beach, with stronger waves, ideal for surfing. The pools were quite nice, even if the wind made it a bit cold to swim sometimes. Food: Quality was excellent, though we would have liked a little more variety in cuisines. Fair amount of local fish and shrimp, which was good, but we were left craving some spicy food. Prices were typical for a resort, and are typically one of the most frequent complaints about places like this. We also do the \"how did that quick snack cost $100?\" every now and then at resorts, but our way of dealing with it is to balance out the nice meals with simpler stuff from local (cheap) places or supermarkets. The best options we found were the Fiji market, about 2 miles away, which had good, spicy, Indian-style curries,and Romy's shrimp truck (not trucks really, just very basic restaurants, similar to the road-side restaurants in Asia), but thats why you need a car. Of course, then the cost of the car has to figure into the cost of the food, but oh well. Overall, I felt the resort does a good job of providing food options - they had some pizzas on the menu, and the Surfer Bar had a happy hour menu with pizzas for $15, which made for a very reasonable meal. Service: This is always the deciding factor for us at resorts - frankly, long after the credit card bill has come and gone, and the pictures relegated to the 46th page of Facebook albums, the memories that remain are shaped by the service we get. One of our cheapest but most memorable vacations was 10 days at an all-inclusive in Playa Del Carmen - because all the people we met genuinely tried to do whatever they could to improve our stay. This place has the same sort of service outlook. When I asked if we could get a room with a better view, they kept one aside for us the next day so we could come back and decide which one we liked better. They took us to and from the golf-course restaurant by golf cart (even though it was a few hundred yards, but it was about to rain). The fire-dancers let my kids re-take their pictures 3 times. We're not high-maintenance customers, but we do remember how our specific requests are treated by the hotel, and this place definitely gets our approval.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Luxury Resort\u201d", "Author": "Kelseymom", "ReviewID": "UR133626002", "Content": "We wanted to experience the North Shore on Oahu, so we booked a Beach Villa for one night at Turtle Bay Resort.

We stayed 5 days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and finished it off with 4 days at the Turtle Bay. This was our first stay at Turtle Bay. As I already mentioned, the location is beautiful!

Pay a little more to get a bigger lanai with two chairs and a little table, otherwise it is a little Juliet balcony. The resort itself is very cool and like someone else mentioned has a very laid back, cool vibe. I think the lobby has been recently renovated and it has a nice little bar called the Surfer that was fun. Great views from the lobby of the ocean as well. Now for the not so great: the rooms were more than a little tired. I had heard that, but I was still pretty bummed when we saw our room. It was not any better than the park and fly hotel we stayed at the night before our flight to Hawaii. I feel bad saying this, but if that is something that will bother you, it is worth knowing. Yes, the location is beautiful, but if room amenities are important, you may want to wait for the renovations. Another point I feel like I have to mention, is the wind.

Obviously, I don't know if that is the norm for that property, but it was very windy the four days that we stayed there and for that reason, I probably would not go back.

I often eat off the resort because it is cheaper and more \"local\", so I can't really comment on the restaurants. The parking is sometimes an issue when its a weekend or an event at Surfer The Bar. Often I found that I had to park near the back end of the last parking lot which I feel is not really fare when we are the guests and should be able to park in the front area and leave the back area for visitors. But all in all I really love this hotel and thats why I keep coming back. I will be back there in 2 weeks to stay for 2 weeks and I can't wait!!! I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to stay in the beautiful north shore away from the tourist trap called waikiki.

The rooms are large but plain, and it's true they are in need of a renovation, but hey are clean and the beds are comfy. The views, particularly from the higher floors, are incredible. It seemed like the resort was filled with mostly couples and honeymooners, but families seemed welcomed too. They had two pools in the main hotel area - a large pool used mainly by adults, and a family pool with a waterfall and pool slide; neither pool was ever crowded despite the hotel being pretty full. The beach cove adjacent was also uncrowded, and beach chairs and umbrellas were available for hotel guests to use. There was pretty good snorkeling right off the beach, and snorkel rental is free for guests for an hour a day. A few caveats: The food here is very expensive, even by Hawaiian resort standards, and eating anywhere else will require a 10-15 minute drive in either direction from the hotel. Even the poolside grill is crazy expensive. Other than the free breakfast included in our package, we rarely ate on property. A grocery store is 10 minutes away, and we stocked our in room fridge with sandwiches and stuff and did picnics on the beach.This is a different type experience than staying in Waikiki; Turtle Bay is a tropical resort vacation, while staying in Waikiki is more of a big-city vacation by the beach.

We'd booked a room with a Juliet balcony, and asked for an upgrade when we arrived, and were offered a room with a full balcony. The rooms themselves are very tired and dark, and the bathrooms are terrible - awful fluorescent strip lighting and an old bathroom suite. The room was big but the furnishings were old, the upholstered chair even had some mould stains on it, and the room had a slightly musty odour too. Food-wise we were also disappointed. The breakfast buffet was ok quality but the omelette chef was fairly miserable, and the two dinners we ate at the hotel were a let down, and not cheap either. I wasn't blown away by the staff actually - the US is known for its excellent customer service but apparently this hasn't reached Turtle Bay yet. My Scottish husband ordered two drinks at the poolside bar and the barman actually turned to me with a look suggesting my husband was mentally deficient and he didn't understand him, instead of just simply asking him to repeat his request. The valet guys are similarly charming, losing their temper with us for being blocked in by another guest who'd abandoned her vehicle in the loading area. This hotel is very expensive (and charges a rip-off resort fee, unlike most European hotels!) but just doesn't deliver. It reminds me of a three-star in Spain to be honest, not a five-star resort in the US, but I don't think the North Shore really has any other \"five-star\" hotels so it gets away with it.

We appreciated the multiple outdoor areas \u2013 pool is separate from two different beach areas \u2013 so that the large capacity of the hotel doesn't seem overwhelming. The pool and pool deck area both are small for the size of the hotel, and felt uncomfortable to us when we attempted to lounge there due to a couple of loud families using the space. Our hotel room was spacious and overlooked the beach (I understand nearly all rooms have ocean views). The beds were comfortable and we liked having a large dressing area with a sink, separate from the full bathroom. However, everything felt a little old and in need of updating or replacement. The closet door wouldn't stay shut, the plastic tray that holds the soaps, etc. looked like it was from a garage sale, the paint on the walls was peeling in a few small areas, and the carpet had a sizable tear. Overhead fluorescent tubes above a dark plastic grate (circa 1970) light the bath/sink area. Yes, the rooms definitely need a facelift.

Planned the whole wedding by searching online and did it all with the help of the onsite wedding coordinator at TB. The cost were reasonable as I had a small wedding of 17. It basically works out like this. There is a package you can download from the TB website that has all the info about the different locations to do the ceremony. We chose The Pavilion, for that just in case it rains possibility. It turned out to be a gorgeous day and we were still so happy to have chosen the Pavilion instead of being on the lawn or the beach in the outdoors. It was more formal and the guest really enjoyed the Pavilion. The cost was $1500 for the Ceremony in the Pavilion. The other locations range from $1000 to $2500 for the ceremony. Since it was a small wedding we went with the onsite restaurant. Their fancy restaurant is 21 but they are not opened on Sunday which was the day of our wedding. So we lucked out and went with Ola's which is right on the beach. The food is cheaper and they do a fantastic wedding menu. Cost per person is anywhere from $69 to $89 for the meal only. Liquor is separate. You get an incredible amount of food. Appetizers to share and each person basically gets 2 entrees. Incredible. Not one person finished their meal and everyone was completely satisfied and truly enjoyed the meal. We did do the rehearsal dinner at 21 and honestly, 21 is a fancier restaurant but you're in Hawaii so go to Ola's Fantastic people there.... You're other choice is at the resort if you have more than 30 guests. I can't opine on the food with the resort but it will surely be more costly (because you have to rent the venue and the menu choices are more expensive than Ola's) and definitely not as good as Ola's. The key is getting the right planner at Turtle Bay. You have to go with Mikilani, she is the best and will make the difference in the experience you receive. I had a different planner when I first started and they never returned my calls as it took a while to lock in the date. They were also no help in making the decision on the reception location. Everything changed when I luckily got assigned to Mikilani. She is thorough and efficient and provides so much help and suggestions. Even the ideas of a sand ceremony that made it feel special and is a reminder of our special time in Hawaii. Don't get me wrong, she is not perfect and she is not your personal servant. She has many weddings to attend to and will probably give you more attention as the wedding date gets closer. They provide a list of vendors, some of which we used. Pastor Ron is the onsite Pastor that does service on Sunday's at the resort. Great choice. $250 + tip Bianca Photography was fabulous. Cost was $2k for 4-5 hours but she was incredibly professional and well worth it. Flowers were by Flower Farm. Cost about $1200 for Bouquet on Bride and maid of honor. All the rest of the floral for ceremony and reception. Very professional and highly recommended Cake was Sweet as Sugar as we went for a Cake Pop wedding cake for 25 ppl that was a big hit. Do the red velvet. $400 - $500 We had a Male Musician. Young Hawaiian Guy. $200 or $250 Forgot his name but he is on the list and a great choice as well . Make sure you take care of Mikilani if you can get her as she puts it all together for you. The one thing you have to splurge on as a couple getting married is a King Size beach cottage. The pictures online does not do it justice. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk in and there's fresh fruit and juice waiting for you, you really feel like you're in paradise. Search around and wait it out and you can probably get the room for less than $400 per night. The other choice is the wedding package rooms which are $200 a night. They were okay. I had a guest that went through Homeaway.com and got a 3br condo right next to resort. There is a main one that is right on the beach that is very nice. And a whole bunch of other timeshares and apt rentals that are nearby but not in walking distance of the resort. I still say to do the beach cottage. You won't regret it. FYI.... Golf package is great deal for the guys or any golfers coming to the wedding... Horseback riding is great too. Snorkeling right on the beach at the resort. Lots of famous Shrimp Trucks nearby Resort and the town of Haleiwa is 20 min away. A truly fantastic time and can't wait to return for an Anniversary. If you want to see more than watch the movie.. \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\". The whole movie was done there. The room they had was the beach cottage and the dinner location was Ola's. The front desk in the movie overlooking the ocean is actually the lobby bar at the resort.

I would say the food at hotel was ok but a little pricey. I recommend Ted's Bakery about a couple of miles down. The golf was great and play after 2Pm as it gets cheaper. About 10 miles down on the way to Haleewa you will be able to see some sea turtles which was great. We also saw a monk seal on turtle bay property.

The views and scenery are breathtaking and the people are over the top nice. There's no way you can get upset in Hawaii! Positives: The beach is public, but it is not crowded and it is nice with snorkeling available The pool with the pool bar Hangten (where Forgetting Sarah Marshall) was filmed Speaking of the sunset it is amazing from Hangten where you can experience the \"green flash\" The breakfast buffet is amazing, anything you want The restaurants are all top notch with the price a little higher, but it's Hawaii what do you expect? Two golf courses on site Negatives: Stay away from room service, pricey and poor quality compared to the other food options on the property Limited number of food options and establishments The trade winds can be very difficult at times An hour drive away from the commercialized tourist areas (this is also a good thing tho too) Wednesday night talk stories at Surfer The Bar...boring!!!

I had never stayed on the North Shore before and I have mixed feelings about it. I love that it is so remote and less people then Waikiki, but because of its remoteness, it takes an hour to get anywhere and since my friend had never been to Oahu before, she wanted to see the sights. Check in was relatively painless except that we arrived at 10:30 p.m. and waited approximately 15 minutes for the reservationist because there was only one person at the desk and there was somebody checking in who was not satisfied with his room selection. They upgraded us to a 2 Queen room on the 5th floor with a balcony. The room was lovely and plenty big, but it could of used a new paint job. Also, a must for me in a hotel is for black-out drapes. Our room only had shutters and we both were up every morning at 6:00 a.m. because of the bright sunlight peeking through the shutters. While at the resort we went to the pool only once as the wind never stopped blowing all week. I was somewhat dissappointed by this as I was really looking forward to sipping some cold drinks by the pool. I did enjoy the hammocks that are lined up along the beach. We did have massages and they were WONDERFUL! A great way to start a vacation. The spa was nicely appointed and inviting. We only ate at the hotel once because after I saw that the breakfast buffet was $30 we decided to find somewhere else to eat. We drove down the street about 15 minutes to a Foodland and bought some snacks and drinks since we had a small fridge in our room we bought yogurt and fruit, etc for breakfast. For lunch, we found THE SHRIMP TRUCKS!!! OMG they were amazing. Just turn left as you exit the resort and it is about 9 miles or so. We went to Giovanni's twice for lunch. I had the shrimp scampi and my friend had the lemon butter shrimp. Just delicious. As for sightseeing, if you leave the resort and turn right and trip your odometer to 0, when it reaches just about 9 miles you are in front of a turtle beach. It was so cool seeing the turtles right in the surf eating on the kelp. Also, we enjoyed going to the Polynesia Cultural Center. I haven't been there in years and it was a lot better than I remembered. We both enjoyed all of the activities and I enjoyed the quick trip home as it is only a few miles away. I kind of felt sorry for the people that had to drive all the way back to Waikiki late at night.

I think this made our stay just that much nicer. As other reviewers have noted, the bathrooms in the rooms could do with some upgrading. Probably the one thing that I did not like was the hotel leaving a stuffed animal on the bed. My little girl was so excited to find it. I initially thought it was a small welcome gift for those traveling with children, but it turned out to be something you could \"adopt\" and take with you for $20. While we really could have purchased it, I felt this was a little manipulative and would prefer if the resort would just have these for sale at one of the gift stores. I would still definitely stay here again. Some positives: We liked the pools and how the kids could go from the large pool to the kiddie pool to the hot tub to the pool with the slide (when open). Our dinner at Ola's was delicious. Try the salmon with the brown sugar and miso glaze (I think that's what it was) and the prawns with pasta - delicious! Of course, it's also fun to mix it up and have a meal at one of the shrimp trucks (the garlic and butter prawns at Romy's was good even with the 45-minute wait) and the Coffee Gallery in Haleiwa makes a good cup of coffee.

This is part of a continuing series of my impressions and experiences staying at various hotels and resorts while traveling to attend concerts worldwide. This review is for the Turtle Bay Resort in Kahuku in Oahu, Hawaii. Property: Turtle Bay Resort Location: Kahuku, Oahu (Hawaii) Address: 57-091 Kamehameha Highway, Kahuku, Oahu, HI 96731 Phone: (800) 203-3650 Website: www.turtlebayresort.com Room Type/Class: Perfect Escapes (Room 540) Date: May 20-21, 2012 Booking Source: Perfect Escapes Overall Rating: 4.5/5 [Note: Score is totally subjective based on price, location, and comparison to \"like\" properties within same area and price range] This was my first visit to Oahu, and having read about and talked with others about Honolulu and Waikiki, I knew I wanted to spend at least part of the time at an area on the island that was, by contract, more \u201cauthentic\u201d Hawaiian. Doing some research, it seemed like the northern part of the island, near Historic Haleiwa Town, would be an ideal place to visit. As such, Turtle Bay Resort seemed to fit the profile of the property I had hoped to visit. I booked the stay through Perfect Escapes, which also included a resort credit, which could be used at the many restaurants and shops on site at the property. Valet parking was smooth and quick, as was check-in. The resort features a beautiful and spacious lobby with incredible views of the ocean. There are also many places to sit and relax to enjoy the atmosphere and views. The room itself appeared a bit more dated than the lobby, but was clean and nice. My particular room featured great ocean views \u2013 nearly 180 degrees \u2013 and I found later that the sunset was centered in the ocean view, which was wonderful as the room featured a balcony with chairs to sit and enjoy the sunset from the privacy of my own room. The furniture in the room was pretty basic but functional. It was fairly large with a big, two room bathroom with sink in each. Also included was an empty refrigerator for your use. As a negative, I found the included Wi-Fi internet to be incredibly slow \u2013 so slow I opted to instead use my tethered smart phone over my carrier\u2019s network instead, as just basic websurfing was much slower than reliable dial-up speeds. Leaving the room, there was a lot to do and explore. While my stay was limited to just one night, I felt as though I could be completely satisfied using the resort, its facilities, and the adjacent beach areas for several says without leaving the hotel and would have been completely satisfied. There are multiple restaurant options, shops, a nice pool area, and an excellent beach. After checking in and getting settled, I had lunch at the outdoor restaurant, the Hang Ten Surf Bar, and watched surfers while I ate, which was a lot of fun. The food was good for sandwich and drinks style fare. That night I decided to have dinner at their Palm Terrace Restaurant in the resort, which features Italian food. Unfortunately, the food here was pretty mediocre, so if I were to return, I would try one of the other restaurants. The property charges a $25 resort fee and valet parking is an additional $15 per night. Overall, I would definitely return for a more extended stay, and prefer this area to Waikiki and Honolulu. I feel the resort has a lot to offer in terms of amenities, and this part of the island was a lot of fun to visit.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eagle River, Alaska, United States", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "Tammy M", "ReviewID": "UR130800470", "Content": "Ok, I read a thousand reviews on this place before booking.

My husband and I spent 5 nights here and it was so beautiful. We hardly left the resort we enjoyed it so much. This was our 4th time to Hawaii ( we live in Alaska so this is our favorite getaway place:) Our 1st time to Oahu. Turtle Bay was a bit of a drive from the airport but I had no desire to be in Honolulu. The downside is food. There are several options at the resort but if you are feeding a family it can be pricey. Drinks, ok come on, the prices were way high, even compared to Alaska! Mai Tai $10, no not worth it. Oh, and refrigerators in the room, I didn't find out about it until after we checked out, it was hidden in the bathroom sink cabinet, who would have thunk it? I should have asked sooner, I just assumed the room did not have one. Each room has an ocean view, we did upgrade to the room with a large lanai, the cottages are quite a bit more spendy not worth the extra for us. Our room overlooked the pool area, pros: could hear the music in the evening, Cons: can be very noisy if you just want to listen to the ocean. Next time I probably will ask for a room overlooking the wedding chapel, nothing but ocean views for miles! and not as noisy.

Once we saw how ridiculous priced and overated the food was, we decided to rent a car to explore the beautiful surrounding areas and its local cuisine and street food that ened of being a fraction of the price and 5 times better then what the resort was offering. After renting the car we also come to realize that there was no designated parking for us as guest and the valet was not only $15 it was available to anyone from the general public including the beaches that are on their 880 acre resort. We saw several families and locals parking their cars and mini-vans and parading to the beach and pool that we assumed was a private amenity of the resort that was included in our \"Resort Fee\". We were wrong. Our anticipated private north shore honeymoon getaway turned into Disneyland as we saw all the locas with their kids occupting the pool and the beaches. We called the front desk to ask if the pool area was for the public and she replied \"no it's only for guest\" but we continued to see several guest, that were not hotel guest, walking around the side of the the buildings, happily going to the pools without any security or anyone checking room keys or asking any questions in respect to who was authorized to be there or who were guest. Mind you, there is a vacant security center at the entrance that had no one in it that is only lit up at night for decorative purposes. The gates are never let down and and we saw not one security on their staff. If you are familiar with Vegas, like we are because we live there, Turtle Bay is like a locals Casino that the general public goes to that has no other options in their area to go to. The hotel casino guests pay the average $15 resort fees and taxes but all the locals more less occupy the casino floor and sometimes sneak pass secuity to go to the pools. Turtle Bay has no restrictions to the public flooding their beach and private property and encourages them to frequent the bar, the restaurants, and other parts of the resort to help boost their economy.

They are truly amazing and Oahu is beautiful, so is the dozen of otherpublic beaches that are on the North Shore thatt cover about a 25-30 mile stretch either direction.

It was hard having my coffee this morning without the smell of plumeria and the sound of the waves! We stayed in one of the beach cottages, which was well worth the extra cost. The room was amazing - a huge comfortable poster bed, marble bathroom with a huge tub (big enough for two!) and a lanai with a table, two chair and a bonus rocking chair. (The view of the sunset was out of this world!) The cottages have their own \"backyard\" with hammocks and private beach access (though the beach is rocky and you need to go to the main beach for swimming). As I said, there was a plumeria tree right beside our porch, and I got to smell it every morning when I went out on the lanai. The beach cottages also had a separate concierge who took care of all of our reservations (dinners, helicopter tour, horseback ride) and delivered fresh fruit daily. Everyone at the resort was super-friendly - you can feel the Aloha spirit the minute you walk in. There are flowers everywhere for you to pick up and put in your hair, and pineapple juice in the lobby. The resort offers plenty of activities - we enjoyed a couples massage, went on a helicopter tour, took a sunset horseback ride, and went snorkeling on the beach (guests get 1 hour of snorkeling equipment free every day!) The resort also offered surfing instruction, tennis, and golf. The on-site restaurants were nice - pricey, but not more than I'd expect to be paying at any other resort. I really enjoyed Ola's, where our table was literally in the sand of the beach. What an experience! :) The property is massive and beautiful and I encourage those who stay here to either explore with one of the walking trails, or to take a horseback ride to see more than just the beach. You'll be glad you did! So - long story long, Turtle Bay was amazing. We really couldn't have picked a better place to honeymoon.

If u are the high maintenance type that are used to stay at Five diamonds property, please do the yourself and the staff a favor and stay elsewhere. This is definately not a luxury resort but it is the most relaxing property on the island with the most amazing view.

Ate at olas and lei leis and Ola is the winner of the 2. Ocean front dining at an affordable price, Jason was awesome. Room 501 was large with a small balcony with one chair, would be nice to have 2nd chair on the balcony. The view is just incredible, got to see sunrise on my bed overlooking the ocean. The room could use a little freshen up. The color scheme is green on green which is ok if u like green. The air vent has some rust and the walls have minor dings and scratches.

I've been to Hawaii 10 or 12 times, but I never stayed on Oahu before. The problem with Oahu is that the vast majority of hotels are located in Waikiki, which I regard as hell on earth. I chose to stay at the Turtle Bay Resort because it's isolated from the city and has a few amenities to make the stay pleasant. The setting for the hotel is stunning - sticking out on a small peninsula with ocean on three sides. There is a small beach on the east side, and the other side has mostly rocks. The views are good in all directions. The beach was only so-so for snorkeling, but the shark's cove location is only about 15 minutes drive from there and has prime snorkeling. The major problem of the north shore is the wind, which was ferocious during our visit. This interferes with almost all outdoor activities, and is apparently a common problem on the north shore. The hotel itself is nicely situated, and the rooms were of reasonable size (but the balconies are tiny). Our room had a king-size bed, but no couch even though there was ample room for it. The pools were pretty small but acceptable. The water slide was barely used while we were there, and they pale in comparison to the Hyatt or Grand Wailea on Maui. The bathrooms are frankly pretty pathetic, because they are long past the point where they should have been remodeled. It's a financial decision of whether to close the hotel and remodel it, and this would undoubtedly result in higher room prices. For my taste, I would prefer that they invest the money in refurbishing and charge more for the rooms. The restaurants are all quite expensive, but that's typical on Hawaii. We had a very high quality meal at 21 Degrees North. We had breakfast at Palm Terrace and it was OK. We looked at the menus of the other restaurants and decided that they were too average for our taste, so we ate several dinners in Hale'iwa. The bottom line is whether I would stay there again, and I think the answer is no - at least not until they remodel all of the bathrooms. Next time we will try the Marriott in the southwest corner of the island (more likely we would go back to the other islands).", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA Beautiful piece of estate.\u201d", "Author": "ShezzyD", "ReviewID": "UR129279276", "Content": "Exotic, beautiful , warming piece of estate.

The lobby area was so well designed as it showed off the estates no. 1 prize and that was the hotel had the most beautiful view of the ocean. The front desk people and car park attendants were so pleasant and accommodating. I mean who would blame being happy was expected if you had to wake up with that view every morning. We were there for our Honey moon so by that point we were so pleased we chose this resort to celebrate our first week in marriage. We got to our rooms and it was the ocean view queen. The room was clean, comfortable and cosy but wasn\u2019t near as beautiful and flashy as it\u2019s outside. Our room did include a bar fridge and a coffee maker. The room did not worry us too much as we were ready to be outdoors the second we entered our room. We had a good view of the ocean bay. The bay was a good area to sun bake and snorkel in as you were protected from the big cascading waves. The resort also provides you with the basic snorkel gear which was handy and really fun. If you grew tired of swimming and snorkelling just lazing around getting a sun tan was also an option. There were many beach chairs around if you chose not to lie on the sand. On the other side of the resort was the swimming pool area and the little bar central to it. It was a nice change of scene, but it was less quieter then the bay area. One little issue was the restaurant food there, it was quite expensive. So if you were wanting to eat out every night it could get pricey. Instead you could opt to drive and even settle to buying fresh fish with rice sold by the locals on the side strip of the rood in a food van. We are from Australia so getting some fresh Mahi Mahi fish was a happy treat. There are also the famous flavoured Ice cones near there. There was so many things to do and see.

A few years ago, one of my college buddies had their wedding at Turtle Bay Resort and it was an experience that I could only describe as something you see out of a movie. The grounds alone are worth the visit; exotic trees and plants, incredible ocean views, tropical breezes and winding trails engulf your senses. It is no wonder that \"True Hawaii\" is a phrase often used to describe this resort. To make things even better, the staff that works here is so friendly and helpful; everyone from the front desk attendants who were so accommodating to the housekeepers who greeted us every morning with a smile. That trip was the first experience I had of Hawaii and I was so glad it just happened to be at Turtle Bay. With my first trip to Hawaii under my belt, you could imagine my excitement when my parents came to me and my brother with the news of our annual family trip decision - HAWAII! (yes, I am 27 years old and my brother is 23, still taking family trips. It's ok, we don\u2019t mind) Of course, at first we thought of visiting a different island since I had already gone to Oahu, but after all of the raving about my experience with North Shore and Turtle Bay, there was really no other option. My mom and brother had never been to Hawaii and I wanted their first experience to be as amazing as mine. Before I knew it, I was back on the plane to Oahu, this time with my parents, bother, aunt and uncle. Note to those who have never visited the island of Oahu: Don't let the initial lackluster views of Hawaii from the Oahu Airport be your definition of \"True Hawaii.\" In fact I don\u2019t even like to fully open my eyes until I hit the North Shore. There, paradise awaits. There are those who like the hustle and bustle of Honolulu and Waikiki beach. But to me, Hawaii is about relaxation, hiking to waterfalls, sipping a mai tai and forgetting all about the real world. All of these things you can easily do from or around the area of Turtle Bay Resort. Now here come the tips and recommendations: EVERY room has a view, although I would recommend asking for a room that faces the bay. I made sure that both visits to the resort faced this direction and I was so happy I did. As with all hotels, the higher the floor the better the view and amenities, but with TB, you really can't go wrong. It's all beautiful. The food is great at the resort, but it is not the most affordable, luckily there are many dining options within a short drive of TB. Of course you have to hit up a couple shrimp trucks. Fumi's and Giovanni's are two of my favorite. Haleiwa Joe's is great for dinner. Ted's Bakery for breakfast. Matsumoto's in Haleiwa for shaved ice. Things to do. For first time visitors that are staying there for a week or more, go to the Polynesian Cultural Center and plan to carve out a full day for the visit. If you are only in Hawaii for a few days, I would not recommend going there since it does take so much time to enjoy all it has to offer. Ha Breath of life is an amazing show and their luau is pretty great as well. Everyone needs some chachkies to bring home for family and friends and a little something for yourself too. You can always buy keychain, lei's, shot glasses and t shirts from the hotel stores, but if you want your dollar to go the distance, try the Swap Meet at Aloha Stadium. It is about an hour drive from the hotel, but if you\u2019re planning a Saturday trip to Honolulu then stop by. Everything is very reasonably priced. I took care of all my gifts for under $50 (and I had a lot of requests from everyone back in Arizona). Other things we did on our 7-day vacation was the Dole Plantation Tour, the hike up to Diamond Head and snorkeled in sharks cove. But what we really enjoyed the most was out multiple visits to the macadamia nut farm about 20 minutes from the resort. Everyone there was so welcoming and their tour was so great. Highly recommended! Again, if you are planning a trip to Oahu and want to get away from the city of Honolulu, then I would recommend Turtle Bay Resort.

Their new bar, Surfer, the Bar was great. They have a great happy hour until 8pm with food and drink specials. The three cheese pizza was awesome! I think it came from the Italian restaurant - Leonardos. There always seemed to be ample chairs by the pool. Yes, you do need a towel card, as others had mentioned, but that was no problem and not a big deal. The cards and resort towels help prevent non-resort people from coming and sitting around the pool. Every evening there is some type of entertainment down by the pool and Hang Ten Bar. That is a great place to see the sunset. Many people surf near the restaurant. They have a small bleacher type area (near Hang Ten) where you can watch the surfers. The newly remodeled lobby area is very nice. Hopefully the hotel plans on continuing some of those renovations into their rooms. The room was nice and spacious but a bit outdated. I knew that going in so it was not much of a shock to me. We were not in the room a whole lot so that did not matter. We loved the larger balcony with our deluxe ocean view room.

Watch Turtle Bay's facebook page for special deals. It's about 45 minutes from Honolulu by car, and the pace is leisurely as posted limits are low. But hey, this is paradise-enjoy the views! If you're planning a wedding this is idyllic, as they have a wedding facility that is all views of the ocean. Breathtaking. the north shore is much less frantic than the urban areas of Oahu and well suited to outdoor pursuits. Unless the surf's up around Sunset Beach, home of the famous Banzai Pipeline. With the layout of the hotel, most if not all rooms have a great view. We're partial to the wing overlooking the pool area, as the ocean is just beyond and sunsets are great to view from the balcony. Higher up is better, though. No complaints at all about the furnishings. As for dining there are some great options. We love dining on the beach at Ola. Open air, balmy, great food. Lei Lei's at the clubhouse has a wonderful caesar's salad with ahi. Perfect late dinner as our flight didn't arrive till evening in Honolulu. The Palm Terrace for breakfast has an extensive buffet. Having said all that, be ready for sticker shock if you haven't dined in Hawaii before. Just accept the fact that a dinner for two with a bottle of wine is $100+, lunches $50+, breakfast $25. A couple miles down the highway is a local institution, Ted's bakery, which is always busy and their food is much less. Their Mahi Mahi plate lunch is memorable, and so are the calories. Be ready to do some heavy exercise to work it all off. Other than that I didn't see much off-property worth trying. Figure also the jet lag you'll feel at dinnertime will discourage you from venturing out. I know north of the resort are the shrimp trucks and farms. Makes for messy eating but worth doing. As a golfer I had to try the Fazio course, the Palmer tournament layout being too pricey and my game wasn't up to it. I was a first timer on Bermuda grass greens, and had numerous four putts. Both tracks are very nice, but my course had just been aerated, and the greens were horrible. If you're a low handicap golfer, be sure to inquire beforehand about this. The golf deal they offer is a logical response to the high cost of shipping clubs. For $65 I got the round, cart and clubs. Too good to pass up. There's plenty to do on-property and other reviewers can detail all that for you. We love this place and it will always be on our Hawaii agenda. They are having a behind the scenes struggle to restructure long term debt with the foreign banks, and have had some financial diffulties in the past.

We were put in Cottage 111, which had two beautiful four poster queen beds. More importantly, it had what we believe is the best view of all the cottages. It's particular building is slanted so that you have both a clear view and privacy on one side, and a full on view of the ocean on the other. We loved sitting on the lanai and watching the surfers, watching the waves, and watching the sunset. Just superb! We at at Ola for dinner on two nights, and enjoyed it. The food was great, and the service very helpful. Be sure to ask to sit outside and your feet will be in the sand while you eat! We rented bikes one day and enjoyed exploring the expansive property and near by areas. On our bikes we visited a WWII bunker, sat under a Banyon grove, swam in a secluded cove, and found our way to an offsite fruit stand for a refreshing snack. It was great. We also enjoyed leaving the property to drive just a little bit South to visit Sharks Cove. We snorkeled, and really appreciated the service from the rental stand across the way. So much fun! We also shopped in Historic Haleweia with great variety and beautiful art. It was a perfect stay until the last night. On that night we were woken up by a very loud beeping sound that sounded like an alarm at about 2:30 am. At first we thought it was a fire alarm, then we checked all of our electronic devices to see if there were alarms going off. We finally realized it was coming from the shower. We turned the water off and on, but it only got louder. We called guest services, and were surprised that they were not surprised or concerned. They recommended running all the water in the bathroom for awhile, and flushing the toilet over and over for an extended period of time. We were told if that didn't work, they would send maintenance. It was frustrating to be awake for an hour and a half in the middle of the night on our last night of our short getaway from our kids. We were disappointed that no one called to check on us the next morning, and that no one apologized for the inconvenience. Missing a couple hours of sleep in the middle of the night at a high end resort seemed like the kind of thing management would respond to--- but they did not. Overall, it was a great trip but we were sorry to end our trip exhausted from the lack of sleep. Final tip: When you go back to the airport, loop around the windward side of the island. Stop at the Valley of the Temples, and then take the H3 back to Honolulu Airport. Even with a stop at the macadamia nut farm and the temple, the drive from TB to the airport only took us about 2 1/2 hours.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alamo, California", "Title": "\u201cIsolated resort on Oahu north shore\u201d", "Author": "eyedr46", "ReviewID": "UR128451426", "Content": "The Turtle Bay resort is by itself on a peninsula on the north shore of Oahu.

The hotel staff (from the housekeepers to, to the concierge, to the servers at the restaurants) were all lovely and helpful. They made us feel welcome and well cared for during our stay. Our room was clean and beds comfortable. Watching the surfers and wannabe surfers. Mai tais. And last but not least, the North Shore! There were a few things that would have me question my return. Nothing major, but I feel that I should provide full disclosure. 1. It is likely going to be colder on the North Shore that it would be in Honolulu. For the most part, it was 22-24 degrees celcius/75 F each day. In Honolulu, it was several degrees warmer. It also rains more on the north shore. We had a spell of rain each day. There is a breeze and the ocean isn't as warm. If you are looking for a beach/pool vacation, where you lie out all day and get a tan, please consider the weather. 2. Kids meals - there was a variety and options my kids liked (burgers, pasta, hot dogs, fish, chicken). They were reasonably priced = $9 a meal (which would include a drink and ice cream). We did find the meals inconsistent. The first time, the cheese pasta was homemade-ish and came with steamed vegetables. The next night, it was Kraft Dinner/Mac and Cheese from a box and there were no veggies. When we asked why we didn't get vegetables, we were told they changed the menu (even though the menu was still the same). We complained and they sent us a lovely fruit basket to make up for it. We were appeased. 3. Location - you are on the North Shore - you really need a car in order to leave the resort. Off resort, you will find great food (garlic shrimp, plate lunches) and beaches (Waimea). Self-parking is free at the resort, so it is nice to have the flexibility and chance to explore. Finally, we paid about $270 per night (this included the breakfast buffet and the sixth night). It is not cheap, especially when you factor in the the equivalent in a place like Mexico, but we did enjoy your stay and felt was we paid was definitely worth it.

I found the amenities and other offerings to be above par and were very satisfied with every aspect of our trip . We elected to stay in a 3 room villa ( third floor) which are offset from the main hotel and essentially front the beach area. These were superbly furnished and served our family of five well. They can be booked via hotel site and I believe some may be booked via private owners ( we booked indirectly through the hotel with a package). Access is via gated area with coded entry. The advantages include your own private heated pool, upscale appointments (BOSE in every room, subzero , etc) and generous space.. We utilized the BBQ on a couple of occasions and were well stocked after a trip to the nearby Foodland. We enjoyed the snorkeling on two days and found it reasonable and not overly crowded. We played tennis on several occasions (brought our own racquets and balls) , did morning runs up and down the coastline and along the golf course. We took a surf lesson through the onsite surf school. The private lesson for myself and my ten year old was excellent and we were able to hit several sets of reasonable waves.(first time out - I recommend going with the private lesson) The point of the bay allowed other family members to be close enough to watch and provided plenty of photo opportunities. The spa services rated well. We ate at Ola's one evening and found it exquisite, a relaxed beach location and unhurried. Our waitor was excellent and steered us to the kalua nachos which were excellent as well as all of our generous portion entrees. Daily maid service for our villa was prompt and efficient. We were able to use the regular hotel pool as well although the private heated pool for villa guests was great. (I am not sure if all villa guests can use the hotel pool or just ones who rent through the hotel. ) We were given towel cards upon arrival. The manager of the villa area was friendly and very helpful. They do seem to monitor this area making sure it is appropriately utilized. When we went over to the regular pool area, we did witness hotel staff ushering some non hotel guests out of the pool area (contrary to other posters- they discouraged non hotel guests ) All in all, I found this resort's amenities outstanding and would consider returning.

We took the elevator down to the beach level and had three separate families with three dogs come on the elevator with us, which we were shocked because pets are allowed in the hotel.

The hotel is located about 45 minutes on the north shore from the Honolulu airport. If you are staying here you will definitely need a rental, but trust me you want a rental because who doesn't want to take advantage of exploring this beautiful island? When you arrive at the hotel you are greeted by an amazing staff who is eager to share information regarding the hotel and the area. The hotels lobby has a floor to ceiling expanse of windows that allow you to have a clear view of the beach and the ocean, as this hotel sits on a peninsula allowing every view to be one of the ocean. The hotels lobby is also where you will find an array of various restaurants, open all day. Promise me you will have the breakfast Buffett that serves hands down the best homemade waffles topped with fruit that is out of this world. I can still taste those blackberries and those omelettes made to order. The beach is home to protected sea turtles and although you can not touch them there is no stopping you from swimming with them. That was an experience my family will keep forever. When you are not swimming with turtles you can always go to the other side of the hotel and enjoy the two swimming pools, while watching the surfers. If you get hungry there's even an outdoor cafe where you can buy quick bites like hamburgers and fries.

If more info is needed please feel free to reach out to me and I will happily answer any questions that you have regarding the island or hotel. Must see's: Koala Ranch Polynesian Cultural Center- they put on a evening show that is amazing. Hanamma Bay- safest area to enjoy snorkeling, it was an old volcano that collapsed and filled with water. It is now protected and taken care of by the state. Again promise me if you love to snorkel that you will go here!!!! Waikiki- one of the worlds famous beaches. The grounds have these beautiful trees that look like pieces of drift wood merged together. The roots spread across the top of the ground. It's amazing!

You can do great walks or jogs every morning around the property and next to ocean ( this is where they filmed lost and another show?) we had a bob stroller and did find with the baby on the trails - some sandy spots that are bit of work but worth it.. There is a pool overlooking the surf spot out in front the hotel that is pretty nice, along with a public/ private cove beach on the other side of the property. Overall the property is really nice but the hotel is a little dated -70's- it is what it is. It is not one of these five stars resorts on the islands, but it has by far the best vibe going...and is ground zero if you want to surf. If you are beginner and want to learn to surf on property they have a great school from a legend Hawaiian surfer Hans Hedeman but be warned it will be a bit challenging- not like waikiki rollers....this is the north shore. Rooms are spacious and most have great ocean views along with balconies. Plenty of restaurants on property but pretty pricey if you eat 3 meals a day on site. I would suggest car rental and drive yourself to Turtle Bay - little over an hour, hit Costco or North Shore market on way to hotel. Eat breakfast in the room and do lunch at Teds, Shrimp Trucks, or Haliewa and dinner on or off property. Pool bar was killer for Sunsets and seemed to be the gathering spot every night for sunset, and Surfer Magazine opened up a nice bar/ club inside the hotel - i would check calendar to see what events they have going. The Polynesian Mormon center is just up the road about 10 minutes from hotel where you can get your Luau and show fix. The drive around the North Shore all the away around and down to Diamondhead and Wakiki is very beautiful. We left around nine and took our time for a few stops, i found Robin Masters Estate and ended up in Waikiki for lunch at Dukes around 12:30 pm. There is a daily resort fee of $25 for towels etc. and they charge for internet, it is a bit pricy but worth it. I would suggest 2 or 3 days in Waikiki for the shopping and other tourist stuff and 3 or 4 days at Turtle Bay for fist timers. We were at Turtle Bay for a week and had great time and will definitely go back - I surfed epic Rocky Point every day. North Shore only has big surf from Oct. through April roughly.

The location is amazing. It really is truly an exceptional and special spot.

So, it was a wonderful revelation to discover what a gem this resort was/is! The Turtle Bay Resort is NOT a five star resort, it is NOT a Four Seasons, and the prices reflect this! If it were, believe me, the prices of everything would be double! However, the location and service ARE five stars! The staff could not have been more friendly, in a genuine way, not the forced five star way... Particularly housekeeping, engineering, and the breakfast staff (Elena!). Our Jr Suite with the breath taking views was perfect for a family of 3, the bathroom with the extra vanity sink worked well for us. Breakfasts were delicious, we miss them already! The amount of activities available onsite is terrific. My family surfed, snorkeled, played tennis, sea kayaked, took advantage of the wide variety of classes at the fitness center (from Hot Hula, Pilates, to several different yoga classes), and I read many books at the peaceful pool, where there were ALWAYS chairs available, and it was Spring break. We look forward to returning and hope to make it annual trip. We did get a peek at a cottage, and it looked amazing, however, we would be very happy with a suite again.

The Deluxe rooms have a full balcony, the other, non-deluxe guestrooms, have small step out balconies. We were on the sixth floor, and had an outstanding view. We spotted whales everytime we were on our balcony during our stay. The resort staff is very nice, the restaurants serve good food, good drinks and with good service.

The hotel is not too large, so it is very easy to get around quickly. There are two pools, two hot tubs, and a small kids pool. All with ocean views. The large pool goes to eleven feet in the deep end (wow). And the small pool, has a waterslide and a waterfall, set in natural rock. On one side of the hotel, there is a large protected lagoon with a lovely beach. A good spot for beginner snorkeling. On the other side of the hotel, there is a nice surf break in the bay for some good surfing.

It was good size, with two separate sink areas in the bathroom/vanity (a nice plus), but all of our room's furniture was dated and felt old, the doors, walls and vanities were in need of new paint, and the bathroom mirrors and fixtures were dated.

Upon checking in, we were approached very apologetically by a manager. The hotel was at nearly full capacity, and the deluxe ocean queen room we had booked was required by a longer stay customer - would we mind staying in the Presidential Suite instead? The only very minor negative was the bedding was king bed only and we are a family of four but the kids happily took the couches. Obviously these accomodations were not representative of the regular rooms but the notable fact is they never tried to charge us extra for the upgrade and the management genuinely seemed concerned that we should be happy with the room. Between the sudden marvelous upgrade and the breathtaking scenery around the resort we were not feeling like moving on to Waikiki. So I contacted the manager again about extending our stay and he said he would see what he could do. We didn't get confirmation until the next day but he offered us a queen beachfront cottage - again at no extra charge. We happily accepted the room and cancelled our Waikiki hotel. Truly the North Shore experience is not comparable to staying in Waikiki. While we did occasionally did lament the fewer dining choices available, if there was more commercialization in this area then it would lose its charm. True, we had to drive everywhere but the scenery is so magnificent we did not mind. At the hotel we dined at Ola's - excellent food (especially the butterfish) and service, Leonardo's - much better than I was expecting - very unusual and tasty ravioli, and the coffee bar for pastries and coffee. We also dined at the shrimp trucks and the town of Haleiwa which is 20 minutes away. We would get fresh fruit from a fruit stand minutes from the hotel and pastries from Ted's Bakery for some of our breakfasts. Amenities - unlike Waikiki, the hotel provides chairs and umbrellas at no charge on their beach at Kulima Cove. We also enjoyed walking the various trails both along the beach and through the jungle. We took the horseback ride and enjoyed it greatly (I have posted a separate review). There is a resort fee of $26 which includes parking, internet, athletic club and some other amenities. Though it seems high, it is altogether lower than paying for similar amenities at most Waikiki hotels. Other perks include being able to view wildlife such as whales, seals, and turtles from the resort. Parking in the general lot was a bit of a hike but the cottage parking was very close and convenient. Cottage dwellers can also call up golf carts to get to other parts of the resort.

Unfortunately, we\u2019ll missed this year, as the continuing education class I had been attending in Hawaii was canceled. For some reason, I missed sending in a glowing review of Turtle Bay the first year, 2010. I think that was because we were ill and wished to put the memory out of mind. Turtle Bay = Great, our feelings about our trip were concealed from us in a haze of that dern bird flu. My wife absolutely loves this place! The staff and service here feels very California upscale laid-back, while still remaining courteous and attentive. I enjoy the fact that the food and beverages are all top-notch. We've only stayed in the hotel portion of the resort, not having resorted, sorry - couldn\u2019t resist, to the other facilities available. Even so, our stay in our premium oceanview room was fantastic. The rooms are spacious, well-organized, airy, and extremely clean. I believe the maid service checks on the room twice daily, with linen changes daily -- towel changes every other day unless you request otherwise. The rooms bathroom is nicely appointed. Open spaces of countertop, double sinks, and a spacious shower area are a pleasant experience. Everything is spotless, at least it was during both of our visits. The bed is a feather top variety, though not a temperpedic variant. I thought it very comfortable, though my wife didn't like the pillows. They were too thick for her. Neat thing about those, firm enough for me, soft enough for her. The balcony was larger than you might think, with full-size loungers table and chairs sitting nicely and not jammed into it. A very pleasant place to hang out for a fruit plate breakfast, or late at night with drinks and your best body-massage partner getting frisky. The lobby of Turtle Bay is wide open and beautiful. Lots of white marble and white plaster compete with beautiful flowers and exotic birds (the great big ones \u2026 like 2.55 feet tall, gorgeously-colored, but LOUD, parakeets, maybe? I don\u2019t really know), only during the day, to draw the eye with bursts of riotous color. Our experience with the front desk staff during both of our visits was smooth, quick, and flawless. No problems with reservations, nor any other problems with any request that we had during our stays. A neat thing, when we went the second time, we were asked if we enjoyed the room from the previous stay, and would we want it again. That room\u2019s view was fantastic (forget the room number, apologies) so we did and got it. Bar service was excellent, the nightclub was fun, though a bit dated, by urban mainland standards. Lots of good music, but quite old, and I don\u2019t mean classic rock, but like Top 40s from 30 years ago, Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran, like that. Dining was also excellent, with prompt courteous and nearly invisible service. The wide variety of food available was all fresh, well prepared, and served with flair. The beach area at Turtle Bay is nice, but a bit rocky when compared to most of the islands other beaches. As beach experiences go, the resort's own beach doesn't hold a patch to the state park beach located about 7 minutes to the south, to say it doesn\u2019t compare well with Waimanalo would be an understatement. That being said, it stomps all over Galveston Island\u2019s East Beach or Crystal Beach. Truly, our only complaint with Turtle Bay as a vacation spot, is its location. It is almost all the way to the North Shore of Oahu. Depending on which route you take south, it takes between 45 minutes to an hour to get back to Honolulu, and the somewhat dubious pleasures of civilization. Our first trip, no problem, as we were lying abed for an average of 15 hours each day. The second trip, however, we had explored everything we wanted to see on the northern half of Oahu, and wanted to go south -- which is a pain. The above being said, the North Shore of Oahu has its own wonderful, beautiful charm. My wife was amazed as, while I was engaged in my classroom experience (in an open-sided pavilion about 40 feet from a State Park beach), she was totally alone on a approximately \u00be mile, curving expanse of one of the most beautiful crescent, white-sand beaches in the worrld. There was simply no one else there, literally. The water was swelling at about 3-4 feet, waves breaking smoothly onto the beach in a soft, susurrant rhythm, and she was all by her lonesome out there. That's the North Shore experience, the way we've come to expect it. Not the North Shore Pipeline surfing, that is a couple more miles from where we were, but even that is laid back, I'm told, compared to other high-interest surfing locales. If you wish to spend a very relaxing vacation, in a beautiful low-key, high-end and well cared-for resort hotel location, Turtle Bay is fantastic.

Must do's - off road segway, ocean kayaking, horseback riding, hiking (on the grounds and the nearby Waimea Valley) and visiting the roadside shops and shrimp trucks along Kam Hwy.

We booked our trip in October, but then started having second thoughts after reading the ongoing Tripadvisor reviews criticizing this property. We understood from the reviews that we could not expect much from the standard hotel rooms. True, the hotel rooms really need updating and decorating to warm them up - however, the room was very clean and a fair size, all we really needed. We had a view of the ocean. Previous guests had complained about the view of the roof of a building - yes, we saw a slice of roof, but above this, a spectacular view of the ocean very nearby. Staff within the hotel and restaurants were consistently and exceptionally friendly and helpful. Only negative was that (probably due to cold weather the first week) the hot tubs were very, very busy - often full of many small children \"swimming\" and splashing, and many of the people in the hot tubs were not staying at the resort but were locals or staying in the nearby condos. Admittedly tricky but would be better if the hotel could find a way to reserve their facilities for paying guests. The hotel has spectacular views, almost everywhere you look - the lobby, each restaurant, even the hall beside the elevator. We spent two weeks at Turtle Bay with our children. As we had a rental car, we travelled around the entire island but were always glad when we returned to the north shore with the relaxed vibe and spectacular scenery. We ate at Ola's on the beach 5 times and it was fantastic each time - service, scenery and food. We had the breakfast buffet on the Palm Terrace several time and while a bit pricey, it was delicious and again with great service - the other days we ate a light breakfast in our room with groceries from the nearby grocery store. Breakfast sandwiches from the lobby coffee bar were excellent as well. Caramel macchiatos from the lobby coffee bar were a staple - delicious with homemade caramel sauce and delicious espresso. As we were frequently travelling around the island we ate out of the resort quite a bit - our favourites were: Ted's Bakery, Shark's Cove Grill, Matsumoto's shave ice, all of the shrimp trucks (!) and the smoothie truck next to Giovanni's Shrimp Truck, Haleiwa Joe's, and a tiny chinese restaurant on the main street in Manoa. We used a travel guide to find our restaurants and had fantastic food at good value throughout our trip. We are frequent travellers and travel with our children.

Big bed, 2 sinks, sea view, cozy duvet, lovely toiletries, free WIFI in room - but a steep $25 daily resort fee on top of booking price ( it includes parking - all hotels seem to charge at least $10ish a day for this). Front desk very efficient; convenience store in the basement. We didn't eat in any of the many restaurants at the establishment ( including 1 on the hotel beach) but had 1 overpriced, not great cocktail at the Hang Ten bar by the extensive pool/hot tub area, where it was nice to sit and watch the surfers though. The nearby beach offers OK snorkelling, as does Shark Cove - this place is no good for kids though as it has a very rocky entry. For turtles you need to go to Laniakea Beach from noon onwards - they come out on to the beach and say hi.

Good eats in Haleiwa - Jameson's, a little Thai on left as you enter town & Cafe Haleiwa. Great smoothie from Lanikai juice. Teddy's Bakery on the road back to Turtle Bay Hotel also fun, but the best food recommendation is Giovanni's Shrimp Truck - turn left out of the resort & its on the left in about 5 mins. Super-fat, super-garlicy shrimps n rice like you've never had before, washed down with a pina colada smoothie or real coconut juice.

We spent a week in an oceanfront cottage at Turtle Bay as a last minute booking after a hurricaine forced us to cancel a trip to mexico. And let's just say, I've never felt more lucky to have had a vacation cancelled! The setting for this resort is unforgetable. My husband and I would just spend hours sitting on our patio staring out into the ocean. Yes, the food is expensive, but we're from manhattan and the prices are right on par with what we'd pay to eat out at home. Definitely recommend driving off the property for some dinners. In haleiwa there is the Cafe Haleiwa- usually a breakfast place that recently began doing AMAZING dinners. Make a reservation and arrive early to buy some wine next door (it's BYO). Also, Ted's Bakery is a MUST for breakfast sandwiches and pasteries. We spent most of our time lounging by the pool (which was a little chilly) and at the beach, basking in the sun with the cooling trade winds breeze. Did a little sightseeing to some of the Lost filming sights (we're dorks), and some hiking on the trails on turtle bay property. My husband played golf twice- the Palmer course made the hassle of flying with clubs worth while. The spa was too booked with weddings for me to get a pedicure during our stay- so book ahead if that's something you want to do! For dinner we ate at the poolside bar twice, Lei Lei's once was ok, went to Ola for a reservation but actually liked the bar menu better so ate in that section and listened to the live music. Never made it to 21 degrees north (the fine dining place) and wish we had demanded our money back for the meal we had a Leonardos- poor imitation of italian food (but again, I'm biased being an Italian from NYC). Breakfast at the Palm Terrace was a bit expensive, but could keep you full all day! Our only major issue was that upon check in there were no more king cottages available as we had booked (granted, our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until after 7pm). Regardless, the two queens cottage was gorgeous, great view. Next day they move us into a king cottage, which was in one of the two cottage buildings that are set back quite a way from the water, overlooking a large lawn with hammocks. Still very beautiful, but no comparisson to the room we had just left. I was very dissapointed, as we were paying the same for this room as all the rooms which were a few steps from the ocean. We called the front desk to see if anyone was checking out of a king closer to the ocean but no luck. The next day we bit the bullet and were moved back into a cottage closer to the water.

So we wound up here as a last resort after taking off from Waikiki in the morning and just driving around and hanging out at different spots along the North Shore. We initially passed by this place while it was getting dark. We drove a bit more and didn't see anything else for a while, so decided to backtrack and knowing we would have to bite the bullet on the price. We didn't have much money and we let the front desk know. We were able to get a small discount through help from the night manager. The room was quite large and looked very luxurious. Everything turned out to be top notch. The beds and bedding were so comforting and particularly after a nice long warm relaxing bath to clean up from the long trip. The bathroom was split with lav and shower in a room while the sink was in an alcove between the bedroom and bathroom. In the same area as the sink was a large built in closet that can hold lots of clothes as well as luggage. A small fridge, coffee maker, and large mirror are also in the alcove. Now the room is described as one of the Ocean View rooms, but we only saw a sliver of it as the rest of the view was made of a forest of AC condenser units. There was a balcony to walk out to and sneak over to one end to get a better view of the ocean. We didn't eat there, but did lounge around the pool are and take dip for about half hour or so. The view from the pool is quite spectacular. You get to see over the bay with hardly an obstructions. There is a smaller pool with a slide for kids, but when we were there the slide was out of order. Hanging around in the lounge area is also a treat as there are large windows that provide great views of the beach and ocean. There is a small trail leading from the hotel down to the beach, which is quite desolate in the mornings and quite peaceful to just walk along to get lose yourself in thought or lack of it.

I had booked an Ocean View room but was apparently upgraded upon check in. I even booked it through hotels.com which was cheaper than doing it directly on the hotel's own website. My room had an amazing view of the ocean and the small beach used by the resort. Very lovely view. The small balcony was also rather nice, although it would have been cool if it was a little bigger. The actual room was very spacious. The bathroom for one was quite big and actually consisted of two rooms. It had all the amenities you would expect. The room was very clean and felt very comfortable and high end. The resort itself is located in an area without much to do, so luckily there's a lot of activities and options within the resort, such as two massive golf courses, tennis courts, a spa and much more. If you don't have a car, though, it's probably not the best place to stay. You can take some nice hikes in the area, and there's a few trails pointed out, but I would recommend having your own car to get around (which I didn't). In fact, the resort wanted to charge an outrageous $140 for a one-way shuttle from Waikiki to the Turtle Bay Resort. I ended up taking the bus which, to be fair, took about two hours but it was actually a rather pleasant trip, much of it along the coast right by the ocean, and I only paid $2.50. In fact, the resort has its own public bus stop just a short walk from the front desk. By the way, don't expect the front desk to look the same way as it does in the film \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\". It looks much better in the film world! And there's now a bar in the approximate location where they had placed the front desk in the movie. The hotel itself has a decent pool, a couple of shops, and some nice restaurants. I had dinner at the Ola which was great, albeit expensive, but my excellent waiter was worth it. I also tried the on-site Italian restaurant, Leonardo's, which was nothing spectacular but the food was decent enough. You can also get sandwiches from the bar in the lobby area. They were fine, but expensive. One of the downsides is a resort fee which should be included in the room price. The hotel, and the North Shore, is a big contrast from the bustling Waikiki area which has a lot of more activity and options.

The concierge service was tremendously helpful in suggesting ideas of where to visit, including helping us find the sea turtles that were hanging out on one of the many North Shore beaches.

I chose to take the 6th floor room & our views were fabulous. The room itself is simply furnished. I did not find the green color of the walls objectionable (as have previous reviewers). There were a few scratches on the floor lamp and the table and a couple of small chips in the paint on the bathroom cabinet but overall the room was comfortable. There was a nice flat screen HD TV in the room. The bathroom was of an adequate size; it wasn't luxurious, but it was clean & operational (which is all I care about). The bed was comfortable, but I could tell that the management has scrimped a little on the thread count in the sheets.

I found that I had to keep the thermostat set at 4 degrees colder than I actually wanted the room temperature to be (for instance, to keep the room at 72 degrees I had to set the thermostat at 68 degrees) but just a minor thing. The restaurants however are ridiculously priced. Our first morning there we went to the Palm Terrace for the breakfast buffet; it cost $58 (plus tip) for the 2 of us. We went to the Foodland grocery about 20 minutes up the road & bought yogurt, fruit, sweet rolls, & juice after that; we kept them in the in-room refirgerator & ate breakfast on the lanai every other morning of our stay. We only ate in one of the in-house restaurants one other time during our trip. One night (when the weather was particulary bad) we ate at Leonardos, the Italian restuarant on grounds. Food again was overpriced. My husband had spaghetti & I had lasagna. Quality was only so-so; I can get food just as good at the little mom & pop Italian place near our home.

The resort grounds are very nice. there are lots of beaches & walking trails. They do have daily exercise classes, but a fee is charged for each one (usually around $10).

Our room smelled musty, had several warped doors and cabinetry in the bathroom and had paint chipping from the ceiling falling onto the floor when the wind would blow in. The lanai was very small any only had room for 1 chair. When we were there, they were having extreme high wind advisories which made it difficult to enjoy the outdoors. We brought our 6 year old to the game room and wouldn't allow him to play any games as they were all filthy! We did report this to the hotel management.

This was our third visit to this resort in five years and each time we have spent many hours researching where to stay, and our decision has always come back to this resort for a variety of reasons. Some things you must know about this resort. First, THIS IS NOT WAIKIKI!!!! If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of a major city, do not stay here. If you enjoy bar hopping or the nightclub scene, do not stay here. If you enjoy two million people surrounding you and clogging the roads and sidewalks, do not stay here. However, if you enjoy a peaceful, quiet place to relax and decompress from all the above\u2026..this is the place for you! This resort is on the North Shore, as far away as you can get from Waikiki and still be on the same island. The North Shore is Hawaiian \u201ccountry\u201d and is a completely different mind-set from the rest of the island. The resort\u2019s tag line is \u201ctrue Hawaii\u201d and this is pretty much what the North Shore is all about. Having stayed at Waikiki resorts in the past and finding most of them over crowded, over-priced, and either understaffed and/or under-trained, the Turtle Bay Resort is a slice of heaven. This third visit was a vacation with all of our adult children, using three rooms and lasting a week. The new lobby is very nice, a lot more modern looking. The addition of the new coffee shop in the lobby is a great addition, offering coffee and pastries. The resort met all of our pre check-in requests, keeping us all on upper floors, in the wing we asked for. Check in was fast and efficient and the staff was very friendly. We have stayed in each wing of the resort now and I would recommend the best ocean views to be from the east wing, facing north. Request a room at the far end of this wing for the best views. Second best would be the southern wing, again at the far end, facing west. This trip was our first during \u201cwhale season\u201d and we sighted over ten whales just from our lanai, including at least four that were \u201cjumpers\u201d, which was exciting to watch. We literally tracked them from one side of the resort to the other, a group of three-four whales for over an hour in one case. Yes, the rooms need to be renovated, especially the bath area, but they are very clean and well kept up. We personally spend little time in our rooms, other than sleeping and showering, so this was not a huge issue for us. I do agree with others who have mentioned that the rooms seem a little bare and maybe a small sofa or chair, other than those at the desk, would be a welcome addition. I personally wish they would repaint the rooms in a color other than the green they currently use as this shade of green I find too \u201cindustrial\u201d. We have never seen mold or mildew that others have reported. The resort needs to look into possibly shifting the beds to the wall facing the lanai instead of perpendicular to the lanai. It\u2019s great having the lanai door open to the sounds of crashing waves but would be even better if you could look directly out the lanai from your bed in the morning! Since our first visit in 2008 I have noticed new televisions (flat screen), new bedding (the best sleep I have ever gotten in a hotel) and mechanical (AC, etc) upgrades. My wife really enjoys the bath amenities from Spa Luana. Housekeeping was excellent and the rooms were always spotless. We ate at all the resort restaurants (except Twenty One North) and found the food good to exceptional, but as others have mentioned, over-priced; which I expect at any resort. Lei Lei\u2019s (next to the pro shop) makes a great breakfast sandwich and is a great alternative to The Palm Terrace breakfast buffet (which at $26.95 is outrageously priced for what is offered). I\u2019m not sure if they want to keep the breakfast at Lei Lei\u2019s a secret or they just haven\u2019t updated all their literature but if you look at the daily event sheet (Navy types can think of this as a Plan of the Day type of thing) left in your room every day, it only lists Lei Lei\u2019s as serving lunch and dinner. After breakfast, from what I can tell, The Palm Terrace restaurant metamorphoses into Leonardo\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure why an Italian restaurant was chosen for a Hawaiian resort, but the food at Leonardo\u2019s was average to good and serving size was generous. Ola\u2019s, while not actually owned by the resort, is right on the beach and they serve seafood to die for! The Surfer Bar is a lively bar/grille area which and also spotlights local musicians/celebrities and is a vast improvement over the old bar there which was completely lifeless. Hang Ten is the pool bar/grille and although I have read a lot of complaints about poor service here, I never experienced anything but superior service and even want to commend Carol (wait staff) for her wonderful attitude and exceptional service. All the staff here were just great. We also really enjoyed the Polynesian Cultural Center crew that came out to entertain us next to the Hang Ten with the Tonga drums and the fire dance performers\u2026very entertaining. Not a golfer, I can\u2019t comment on the courses, but my sons and daughter seemed to enjoy their experience. Three of us decided to try the \u201cOahu Extreme\u201d doors off helicopter tour offered from Paradise Helicopters, who are located right on the resort. This was a great tour, although it got a little chilly over the mountains (bring a sweater/sweatshirt!). We all got some great shots of Sacred Falls in particular and the North Shore in general. Josh our pilot and Sarah the \u201cground Staff\u201d were great. The tour takes you from Turtle Bay, down the east coast to just north of Kaneohe through the Kualoa Ranch area and then over to the Waimea Bay area and all the well known surfer beaches (Banzai Pipeline, Sunset Beach, etc) and then back to the resort. All in all, about a 45 minute flight. The hotel grounds are spotless, very well kept up and absolutely beautiful. Lot\u2019s of photo opportunities just in the plant life around the resort. For walkers/joggers, there are miles of paths, both along the miles of empty shoreline and along the golf courses. We walked the beach in both directions from the resort at various times and rarely saw another soul\u2026very peaceful! The resort also offers trail rides and Seqway tours along these paths but we never ran into any on our strolls. The resort has an adventure center where you can set up horseback riding, Segway tours, kayaking, mopeds, helicopter rides, etc. You can plan an entire week\u2019s activities through them just at the resort if you are so inclined. If you like to explore though, or want to go to Honolulu/Waikiki, you need to rent a car. We rented directly from the airport and used our vehicle for various day trips. There is also an Enterprise car rental at the resort. Plan on 45 minutes to an hour to get to Honolulu from Turtle Bay, and longer during rush hour. I thought Washington DC was bad during rush hour but the H-1 highway is right up there when it comes to gridlock. Other than a few \u201ctouristy\u201d things in Honolulu, we steered clear of the urban parts of the island. We had a lot of fun in Haleiwa and along the surfing coast. The drive down the leeward side of the island is breathtaking, mountains on one side of you and the ocean on the other side. Remember that you will be charged a resort fee for each day you are at the resort. Why this is not just added to the room rate, we don\u2019t know but while I see a lot of people complaining about this, you need to look at other resorts that charge up to $20.00 a day for parking, $10-15 daily for Internet,more for equipment rental, etc. I\u2019ll pay the 26.18 fee. Overall, Turtle Bay, while not a five star resort (they don\u2019t bill themselves as such), is a great place to stay and I would give it a solid 4 stars. I have read negative comments here but after three visits in four years, I have never had an overall negative experience. Very rarely we have come across an employee who may not have given the best customer service, or a meal that wasn\u2019t the best, but overall this is a very high quality resort that really tries to satisfy the needs of every consumer.

This was our second visit to the resort, having first visited there in 2010. We had a wonderful stay and were completely satisfied with our experience. We did stay in one of the ocean-front cottages. These units place you literally within 30 yards of the breaking surf. Nothing is any better than falling asleep to the sound of the waves crashing ashore. We would highly recommend that option to anyone who can afford the extra charge. I have read many of the reviews posted on TripAdvisor and am amazed at the number of negative comments about Turtle Bay. Our experience was totally at odds with those of the critics. Turtle Bay's greatest asset is the location. You could not ask for a more beautiful, serene setting than this. The North Shore of Oahu is a different world than Honolulu and Waikiki. The pace is slow, everything is very casual, and you avoid the crowds that plague other parts of the island. The resort has something to offer for those who want to be active (golf, tennis, horseback riding, scooter rentals, etc.) and those who want to chill (peaceful lanais, a nice pool, a protected beach, and miles of hiking trails). The restaurants have something to offer most palates. The resort is older, meaning that you can expect to see some signs of age in places. The room fixtures and furniture are not the latest but they are more than adequate for most tastes. The staff appears to be diligent about trying to address the maintenance problems that come with any older structure. We found the service to be excellent. The check-in process was smooth and efficient. Every staff member we met was friendly, accommodating, and competent. Special thanks to the ground crew that keep the lawns and foliage immaculate. The resort offers great views of the North Shore's fabled waves. Many critics have complained that the resort is too expensive. I would agree that the rates are high, but they must be viewed in the proper perspective. The nightly rates for the cottages are more than we would normally pay, but we have not found another property anywhere that gives you such luxury and puts you that close to a beautiful beach. Food prices are high everywhere in Hawaii, and the restaurants at Turtle Bay are no exception. I would note, however, that we have spent as much or more for food staying at one of the Las Vegas luxury hotels such as the Wynn. If you really can't take the resort prices, there are more reasonable options locally such as Ted's Bakery or Tita's Grill. Haleiwa has some great eating places that are more moderately priced. Having said that, we enjoyed great meals at Leonardo's and Twenty-One Degrees North as well as a fantastic room service breakfast on our lanai.

First the room: the air conditioning vent was rusty and it shouldn't look that way for a high end resort. And the couch had some stains making it look not so fresh. The restaurants are numerous (3 bars, an italian restaurant, and a fine dining place) but the menus could have been better. The bars served potato chips, burgers, fries, chicken fingers, etc.--nothing too inspired, and the potato chips came in the bag so it wasn't like they were homemade. Leonardo's had delicious Italian food and a buffet on Saturday night (not too enjoyable to watch people gorge). Breakfast is either a buffet again or muffins and fruit and coffee at a \"bar\" in the lobby. For $20 we had two coffees, two pieces of fruit, a muffin and some oatmeal. One of the best parts of Turtle Bay is the activities. We got up early to do a private horseback tour with Vera. She is very friendly and an asset to the resort. I strongly recommend if you like horses to do this one-hour ride ($125 per person). You can also take surfing and stand-up paddle board lessons, kayak, snorkel, rent mopeds, play tennis, enjoy the pool, or walk for miles on the beach.

This is not a luxury resort. Rooms are dated - and the modernization is a coat of paint over everything - even the tiles in the bathroom shower are painted over and peeling. Front desk service and hostess service at Olas was terrible. Stood at the counter for minutes without anyone saying anything. At check-in we had to ask \"where do I check in\" before someone acknowledged they could help us. At Olas same staring down before the hostess said \"can I help you?\". In an empty restaurant, most restaurants assume table for two, but here she asked us if we had a reservation. Waiter and food at Olas was good, and so was the location on the beach, but the decor suggested beach bar and grill, but the food was closer to fine dining. Also very slow was service at the Hang Ten bar at the pool. Waitress came over after 20 minutes (we were only about 10 feet from the bar itself), it took 15 minutes after ordering to get drinks, 30 minutes after ordering to get an appetizer, and 30 minutes after we were done for the waitress to come back. Because of the high winds, we - like most people around the pool - ended up taking our own food to the garbage, because everything blows over and service is slow. The high winds keep everything rather cold - no one was ever in the pool during our stay. What is nice about this hotel is the expansiveness, the ability to take a walk and get away from other people. However, I did expect more signs and trails that were not horse trails. If you take a right after the bridge by the pool there are nice hammocks that we enjoyed. For resort activities, there were not any activities that really caught our eye. A lot of the rentals are to take off site. Food and service at Lei Leis was the best - I would recommend this as the number one restaurant at the resort. Otherwise food in the town of Haleiwa is good. We stayed half our time in Waikiki and half of our time here. If I had to do it over again, I would have stayed the whole time in Waikiki- and just taken a day trip to the north shore - the town of Haleiwa, sunset beach, and the turtles at Lanikai beach.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay on the North Shore\u201d", "Author": "Colee626", "ReviewID": "UR125045195", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here on our Babymoon in February, and it was very relaxing.

The other parties room that we were traveling with also had a poor room. Tiolet plunger not working and chipped furniture. The room lamp shades were dirty and some broken. I complained to front desk and then they proceeded to show me a room no better so i asked to speak to the night manager Aron who was pleasant and apologetic. He moved me to a suite 680 which i informed him that the room was way too big. It too was out dated and the room furniture needed to be up graded to say the least. The bed frame was dirty and broken therefor always rocking like a boat at sea. After 2 nights we decided to check out and the other party as well when we were suppose to stay for another 5 nights. The restaurant on site were not deserving of the prices they were charging at all. The plates of food were simple and not fancy but the pricing structure was not deserving. The Italian restaurant served me over cooked Calamari that was not fresh when the server explained to us how fresh it was going to be and the menus..... plain simple type print laminated... something you'd find in a diner not this resort..... The laminate was actually coming apart in your hands as the corners were all peeling. The beech Restaurant was no better when we got to try it the second night as the first night the front desk person told us it was open until 10pm and after walking there a staff member informed us that the Restaurant Manager decided to close early as it was not busy and this was 8:30pm???? come on people???? We did go back the second night and found it was over priced as well for what was being served and actually found that the server told us it is an independent Operator and that is why the night before, they closed early. The over all property sits on beautiful land and beach and it is a shame the Operators have let this Property go like this. It needs maintenance and new furnishings every where. The HVAC ceiling vent louvres were rusting in places and actually any metal areas where showing signs of rust in areas..... The basement level area going to the pool area was dark and ceiling tiles stained in a lot of areas... lighting in this area was very poor and those poor shop owners down there and a gift shop area with no traffic etc.... I asked 3 staff members on the resort where and what restaurant they recommend i try for meals and every one of them told me the food was all \"crap\" on the resort and if i wanted a good meal..... drive to either town... turning left or right out of the resort.

We decided to spend Valentine's Day at the hotel after spending 5 days in Honolulu. We booked a beach cottage for one night and we were very happy when we got to the hotel at around 11 AM and were able to check in. They gave us room 110 which had a king bed and was only steps away from the beach and the wonderful sound of the ocean waves. The beach cottage room was large and clean, with a huge bathroom area as well. As soon as we walked into the room we got a call from our concierge who arrived with a tray of fresh guava juice, apples, bottled waters, and a welcome amenity of a small wooden ukulele. We chose the beach cottage room and the hotel because we had seen it in the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall and it was even better in person. We only had one night at the hotel so we did as much as possible at the hotel. We first went swimming in the pool area and WOW the big pool was cold. The pool with the water slide was much warmer and while it did take me a while to convince my wife to go down the water slide, once she agreed and tried it she liked it enough to go down it a half a dozen times. There are 2 hot tubs in the pool area and the one by the pool bar had some great views of some huge north shore waves. We made a quick 5 minute drive to Romy's Shrimp Truck and had a really good lunch, and then grabbed our snorkel gear and went to the beach front area on the other side of the hotel. There is a snorkeling and swimming area that is protected from the waves by a reef and it was a very peaceful area to snorkel in. We were able to track down a turtle and swam with him for a bit, and we saw a lot of colorful fish and an eel as well. It was great having such a nice beach and snorkel area only a few steps from the hotel. After spending some more time back at the pool we headed west and walked along the beach area down to the huge Banyan Tree, which I had wanted to see as I am a fan of the TV show Lost which filmed a lot of scenes there and at the beach a few dozen yards away from it. While we were walking we came across a horse back riding tour of the area and that is something we'd like to try on our next visit. It looked like a lot of fun. The area to the west of the hotel is quite beautiful. We got back to the hotel in time for an incredible sunset and headed to our Valentine's Day dinner at Ola, one of the restaurants on the property. My wife and I each got the fresh fish of the day, which was Shutome, a variety of swordfish. The dinner and the service was great and the restaurant is right on the beach. A perfect setting.

I have stayed at Turtle Bay 3 times over the past several years. This resort, located on one of the most beautiful pieces of land in the world, used to be our favorite place to come and relax. However, the resort has been on a downward trajectory in recent years, with complete neglect of the guest rooms in the main building. I suspect the cause is financial--ownership by a bank and then by private equity firms is never a good sign these days. Our last visit was a little less than two years ago. We stayed in one of the better, ocean-view rooms on the 6th floor. The furniture and shutters were chipped; the carpet was threadbare, the TV was a good 25 years old, the bathroom was dingy, one of the phones was dead and the light on the data port blinked 24/7 (we threw a tshirt over it at night). Yes, it was clean, but so is Motel 6. The restaurants and other common areas have been maintained, but what's the point if your room is a wreck? Between our first and second stays, the resort built a conference center, the enormous and jarring blackltop of which ruins the views from the rooms that had had the best views. Turtle Bay could ameliorate that by building a roof garden on the blacktop that is the first thing you see from the ocean-view rooms with real lanais (the smaller \"lanais\" are actually Juliet balconies). Note that the difference in cost between a room in the main building and one in the newer outbuildings is over $200 per night, so you're talking a completely different cost bracket to avoid the bad rooms. Another thing to note is that Turtle Bay is the ONLY hotel or resort on the North Shore. So, no matter how bad things are, its ranking will always be #1.

The surf is gorgeous, fun to watch the surfers and paddle boarders. The whales spouted and breached across the vista from our balcony. There are two premier golf courses on site that are a bargain after 3:00. It is far from the crowds and high rise buildings of Honolulu. The staff was friendly and responsive. Breakfast was included in our package and was varied and fresh each day. There are ample \"adventure\" opportunities: snorkeling, Segways, horseback rides, lessons in paddle boards, tennis, surfing, etc. The property, landscaping, pools, paths are well maintained. The bed linens were very nice. We received good recommendations for dinners in Haleiwa. We enjoyed our visit to Pearl Harbor. The memorials offer the visitor the opportunity to learn as much as they want about the history preceding and following the attacks. It is respectful, somber, and yet beautiful BAD NEWS. What makes it a great place to surf, makes it a rocky beach, not good for surf walking, although there are paved trails for running. Our last day we discovered a gorgeous beach 7 miles further north that was sandy, great for walking and body surfing without fear of disturbing, or being disturbed by surfers. The bathroom was in poor condition with chipped porcelain in the tub, warped doors and faucets that soaked the counter when you washed your hands. The furniture is peeling, scratched and in general poor condition. The food on site was expensive (not that this is a surprise at a resort) and only moderately good, not interesting or exciting. Although our experience at Pearl Harbor itself was good, getting there was difficult. We are from the Chicago area, so we are used to traffic and highways, but the area around Honolulu is a mass of criss crossing, interwoven roads, with scant signage to direct you to Pearl Harbor. We drove through Honolulu with all of its high end stores, masses of people, cars and buses, and crowded beaches and were grateful that we were not staying there. This was our 4th trip to the Hawaiian islands, our first to Oahu. We chose right for our likes and needs by staying away from the city. We loved the surf, the look and sound of it. We were on the 5th floor, so whale watching from our balcony was excellent. The golf was good.

I was quoted prices without tax and resort fees and with them as well. I asked about the oceanfront to see if it had a direct ocean view. I was told it had stunning ocean views and looked directly out to the ocean. Upon arrival, I was given a different price which was more than $100 more for the night. I was told that the price I was quoted didn't include taxes and fees and besides they would have sent me an email confirmation as well. I explained that we left home soon after making the reservation and I had not seen a confirmation. However, they did have my reservation. I had the piece of paper with me that I had written the prices on. I noted that the price they were now giving me was the Junior Suite price. The hotel clerk went to speak to the Manager and came back to say that the price she had given me was correct. I said that we had come out from Kailua expecting to be paying a certain price to celebrate a special occasion, and I didn't think that, as the customer and a local person, I was not being treated very well. She then grabbed her calculator and after working some numbers said, \"Well, this is the best rate I can give you\". That rate was still a little over $30 more than I had been quoted. I said that I would take it. She then started taking my information and asked for my email address and that is when it occurred to me that the person I had spoken to on the phone had never asked for my email address so therefore could not have sent me a confirmation. I pointed this out and also relayed the conversation about the oceanfront room. I was basically not spoken to again or given any directions on getting to the room but handed a key. Upon arrival in the room, I see that we have been given a room as far away from the ocean as possible at the very end of the hall looking through the trees to the bay. I immediately called down to the manager and explained that so far this had not been a very good experience. To his credit, he said let me see what I can do and call you back. He called back after a few minutes and said that he had an oceanfront room for us on the top floor and would be sending a bellboy up right away to take us there to see if it would be okay. About 15 minutes later the bellboy showed up and took me and our bags upstairs. The room did look right out to the ocean so I accepted it. The bed was very comfortable; there were 2 sinks; and it was oceanfront and had a lanai. Those were the deluxe features of the room. The rooms are very plain hotel rooms otherwise.

There was nothing like being able to open the door and see/hear the ocean. The bathroom had 2 separate sinks which was really nice when my husband and I were both getting ready. The TV had basic channels but we didn't go to Hawaii to watch TV. The wifi was iffy in our room but again we didn't care too much considering we were in Hawaii. Our first night there we ended up falling asleep and waking up around 8:30. We didn't realize that most the restaurants closed early so keep that in mind if you eat dinner late. We ate at most the restaurants and they were all good. Most the meals were pretty expensive but we expected that most everything would be expensive while we were there. We ate at Leoardo's twice - once we ordered a pizza and brought it to our room and another time we ate there. Both times it was good.

The breakfast was really good and I would suggest trying to get a package with this included since it help cut down the cost of food. The waffles and omelets were our favorite! Most nights we would go to the Hang Ten bar for happy hour and ate dinner there one night. The bartenders were always really friendly and the views were unbelievable. We ate at Lei Lei's twice which is over at the golf course. They have really good steak and it was reasonably priced we thought. We also got the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream dessert which was delicious! We also ate at the restaurant right across from the check in desks and there was a musician there. It was a nice place to hang out and we both got chicken fingers, they were good but keep in mind they were around $12 each. The beach around the area is amazing. Several days we got our early to get the beach chairs and umbrellas that they offer for guests to use. Some days they did all get snagged pretty early but we were fine laying in the sand. We really liked the towel service, it was nice to not have to worry about lugging wet, sandy towels back and forth from the room. We also went horse back riding twice through Turtle Bay. The first time was just the standard 45 minute ride and it was beautiful. It goes to the biggest banyon tree that was in Lost and Pirates of the Caribbean. They also take you to a secluded beach that was also in Lost. The second time we went was the longer sunset ride. It went on the same trail but was a little longer.

The public hot tubs were quite deteriorated, with many loose or absent tiles. The decay was everywhere evident, but the setting was fantastic.

Overall it's a great location, and a great hotel. I would pick Turtle Bay and the North Shore over any other place on Oahu. I'll comment on a lot of things both good and a little bad. First the hotel itself is world class. It's the only resort on the North Shore and the locals want it to stay that way. To understand it all you have to do is drive into Honolulu/Wakkiki/Diamond head for a day trip. The North Shore is called the country by most folks on Oahu. It's where everyone goes to get a way. Since it was the holidays when we were there, it is a CROWDED area. But because it has no competition it can command a premium price. The hotel is very clean, the staff is very professional and friendly. The room are very nice. We were on the 3rd floor of the west wing and had a great ocean view with a full balcony. I think the only really bad rooms were the 2 floors below us because the ball room part of the hotel would interfere with the view. Some of the balconies only were partial, meaning it would be very difficult for 2 people to sit on them. Other than that, all the view I think would be fabulous. Our room had a two sinks (which is always a nice touch in a hotel) large bathroom area, mini fridge. I would have like to have had a microwave in it. It also had a nice flat screen but you couldn't adjust the picture size on it. The beds were great also. The only real fault with the room was the air conditioner. It didn't cool the room very well. But I call house keeping and they brought a fan up which made all the difference. House keeping does a great job there! We attended a church service being held at the hotel on Christmas eve and it was great non denominational service. The pastor does a Sunday service at the hotel also. I learned that Turtle Bay donates a very large breakfast (for over a 1000 people) for the area homeless on Christmas as well as other things through out the year. It's nice to have resort do that. There are 7 restaurants at the resort. All of them are very expensive and the selection is minimal. I was really disappointed that they did not have a wider variety on their menus. The best was the morning buffet. The egg chef was great!! She really can make an omelet. They also have a wide variety of fresh fruits, breads, etc, etc... The rest of the time it was a choice of a cheeseburger (lowest cost I think was about $16), some seafood or beef dish. I choose not to eat at the Italian restaurant because that's just wrong in Hawaii. I do have to say that Ola had some of the best Poke I had on the island. And one of the best views. The Hang ten Bar is by the pool. It has live entertainment most nights but they stop serving food at 7pm. There are a variety of things you can do at the resort but all are costly. I would definitely recommend that you take a surf lesson. It's taught by Hans Hedemann's Surf School which is located right at the resort. The folks that run it are GREAT!! My 16 year old took a 2 lesson and was up riding waves within the first hour. The instructor that helped him was from Australian and did a great job. My son spend the rest of the trip down there hanging out and riding waves. Overall, it's a great resort but you pay for what you get. There is a lot to see on the North Shore. You must get a car to see it. Good job Turtle Bay with your part of the experience!

The resort is beautiful, on a large, carefully tended property right on the coast. The pool area, while not as huge or modern as some resorts, was not over crowded, offered poolside drink and food service, and an unbeatable beachside location with tremendous surf and many people surfing each day... just mezmerizingly beautiful. We stayed in the beachside cottages which were roomy, nicely decorated and in a secluded beachside locale, easy walking distance by garden path to the pool and main hotel restaurants and with lots of parking nearby. The bathroom was beautiful with glass shower stall, huge separate soaker tub and lots clean linens, and daily-supplied soaps and creams. The water pressure was strong, the rooms were clean and smelled nice, but yes there are some minor details like trim that is warped from water damage at the shower stall. We had two minifridges and a sink area in our king size rooom, great for keeping drinks and supplies and preparing snacks and simple breakfasts. We were provided by the resort with fresh fruit every day. Turtle Bay staff (especially Judith our lovely housekeeper,all the cottage concierge staff and Laura in the hotel store) were all very kind, friendly and helpful. The on-site restaurants were good, with excellent service staff, but pricey. We tended to eat off resort in Hale-iwa, very close by and a fun town to visit. There are many restaurants there with a good variety of food from American, to Mexican and Thai. We also had takeout breakfast from Ted's Bakery just down the road that the kids loved. The resort spa, and seaside massage cottage for two (what at treat listening to the pounding surf!), was great. Regarding the weather, yes, it rains a little everyday: a sunshower with almost guaranteed rainbow that passes gently over like a blessing in this little bit of paradise! No wonder the hills and valleys are so lush and verdant. The weather was perfect, sunny and hot most of the time, cooling in the evening enough to wear a light jacket or pashmina.

We then came to Turtle Bay expecting it to blow our socks off (we had seen the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall and was expecting something like what that movie portrays), but it was quite the opposite. The room was almost bare looking. Lots of random empty space. It felt like a dorm. The bathroom had horrible fluorescent lighting- looked like it hadn't been updated since the 70's. The paint was chipping everywhere and the drawers smelled like mildew. There were also broken-esque old lamp shades. For the money- It was AWFUL. The staff was OK. Kind of nonchalant and laid back.

I have to say, at first we were a little disappointed. Based on the reputation of the resort and the price for a night's stay, we were expecting extreme, complete, unadulterated luxury. Like other reviewers have said, our Pikake Suite was very spacious but seemed a little dated. Before we arrived I had read somewhere that the resort was built in the 1970s and that it was remodeled in 2003. But, our room definitely felt older than 2003. The good: our view of the ocean, the breakfast at Palm Terrace, my massage in the spa, walking trail on the grounds, kindness of each and every staff member we encountered. The bad: the floor plan on the website showed the Pikake Suites with patios, but ours didn't have one. The food prices were extremely high in the resort restaurants. Also, we weren't expecting so darn much wind. The ugly: ants in our bathroom (but we had this problem at our rental house in Kailua as well) and dinner at Leonardo's. We placed our order, and our waitress came back about 10 minutes later....about the time we were expecting our food to arrive...to tell me they were out of my choice for dinner. Then, when we did get our food, we didn't get any bread. I saw a table nearby get a basket full of bread, so I asked if we could have some. Our waitress told us that the restaurant was \"out of bread\" and she had only given the other table some because they had kids and had asked her to scrounge up any bread she could find for them. Really??!!

The perfect fit for this hotel is someone who doesn't mind a little rain (it normally rains here every day at least for a little while), who likes to travel off the beaten path and try local food and less touristy places. During the winter time they hold surf contests at Sunset beach when the waves are up. The weekend we stayed there was a big contest which can delay traffic a bit.

I would recommend this if you are wanting some time to chill out and not worried about having shopping or access to restaurants. We found the staff unwelcoming on our arrival which after spending 13hours from Australia was disappointing. Basically, we gave our name, credit card and we got a room number in return; no explanation of parking, facilities or that \"Aloha\" hospitality we were expecting. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a room with a balcony. The hotel is also a bit tired and undergoing some refresh. Our room was clean and of average size accommodating two queen beds, and all rooms do have an ocean room. The hotel offers good options for restaurants and we did have Italian at Leonardo's. We found the price reasonable and the food was good quality and value for money. Outside of the hotel, you don't have a lot of options nearby. The best options are in Halawei town which offers a number of quality bakery(s), burger joints, cafes (and a McDonalds if you are that desparate). Overall, I found the food on the North Shore a bit limiting, but there is a Foodland supermarket about 15-20mins drive from Turtlebay at Sunset Beach and is next to the Shark's Cove Grill which is ok for a lunch option. Their is a nice pool and gym at Turtle Bay. Beach itself is clean, but options for snorkelling and swimming is limited as there are coral/rocks but doable.

North Shore is known for the high waves. We rented a car as Turtle Bay is really not close to anything. But if you are going for relaxation and wonderful views of the ocean it is a nice place to stay. I just think it is a little over priced for what you get.

The restaurant Ola was the best out of the ones we tried. Leonardo's hands down the worst, the lasagna was pretty much a pasta lined bowl with meat and cheese soup inside. Thankfully, they took that off our bill for us. Palm Terrace was a decent breakfast. At night Palm Terrace turns into a different restaurant, we liked the pizza there.

I am a travel agent in Toronto, Canada and had done alot of research into the hotel so I knew pretty much what to expect in terms of location, but I didn't realize how far away from everything it was. First off- it is about an hour from Honolulu, pretty drive.. very scenic. The cost of a taxi is about $100 each direction. We used Oahu airport express- private transfer where the driver seemed super sketchy and scary .. but totally reliable and always on time. The resort itself is pretty isolated and there isn't much around that you can walk to other than some public beaches and plantations. The dole plantation is closeby as well. We stayed in Maui for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon and wanted something a bit quieter and more romantic for honeymooners. It was funny because all of the reviews had mentioned no kids and lots of couples but the first day on the beach I had never seen more kids in my life!!!!! They were everywhere. No complaints but just funny that it was the total opposite, but it was only that one day which was probably a Saturday and it is a public beach afterall. The resort shuts down pretty early at night, and although there are some bars and restaurants we found ourselves in our room by about 8pm or just after dinner which was okay with us because we were up early. The resort is a bit dated, and the rooms are big but very simple... no pictures on the wall even. It did not look what they made the resort look like in the movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and although you can see where different scenes were filmed it wasn't as luxurious as it was in the movie. The beach was pretty clean, and if you stay at the resort the beach chairs are included (limited) which is a bonus because the resort in Maui you had to pay about $50 a day if you wanted one. You couldn't swim out very far as there is tons of coral nearby so the snorkelling isn't the greatest. On the other side of the resort you would often see surfers out in the evenings because of the strong surf. The restaurants were nice and clean, the food was pretty much the same all around. The buffet breakfast was AMAZING! and although a bit expensive... well worth it if you are a breakfast person. The pizza was also amazing in the dinner buffet. The bar by the pool serves great appitizers and full meals if you want them. We didn't leave the resort out of the 6 days we were there... so it was very relaxing but because there wasn't too many things going on some days it was a bit too relaxing!

The title sums up our vacation nicely.Some parts of the vacation experience were great some not. Turtle Bay is not really close to anything so you need a car to get there and tour other sites. The setting is spectacular and the grounds are amazingly well kept. We witnessed 2 weddings while we were there so it appears to be a popular spot for weddings (you would need to be ok with ocean breezes and less than perfect hair for pictures) The Good: The staff, other than some of the front desk staff (see the bad) were polite, cheerful and helpful. The restaurants/bars all provided a good vacation experience. The Palm Terrace breakfasts were good, the upscale Twenty One restaurant on site was excellent. Ola, the beach restaurant has great ambience and is a wonderful place to dine with the beach and ocean as backdrops. One of our meals at Ola echoed the review - my wife's meal was excellent, mine so bad that I would not finish - the manager listed to my concerns and reduced the bill by the amount of my dinner although I had not asked for that. Nice touch and I have no doubt that we would visit Ola again. Lei Lei's, the dining venue at the golf course was very upscale with good food, service and ambience. The beach is small, but very pleasant and the surf school around the bend from the beach appeared well used and popular. The pool area is very clean and well kept and the food and drinks were ... well appropriate. The golf course staff were great - very informative, helpful and appeared very interested in making sure you had a good time. We played the easier of the two courses and used the afternoon special rate deal. Full marks here for experience, cost and staff. The Bad: Well not a lot, but what didn't work was some of the importnat things to us. The front desk staff at check-in were the exception to the great staff we encountered here and set a poor example for the start of our holiday. On check in, they were abrubt, disinterested and unhelpful. On checkout, a different shift and very polite and helpful. Our room was the pits - likely the worst view in the resort. The room was very large but sparsely furnished and the furniture there was old, worn and stained, not to mention uncomfortable. 1 table, 2 table charis, 2 bedside table and one comfortable bed. Bathrooms were a green colour and in poor shape. The room was reminiscent of a cheap motel. All in all not up to the rest of the resort experience but we didn't spend a lot of time there anyway. Would we go again - in a word no. The resort is undergoing renovations and the rooms, if ours was the standard, badly need a refit.

The staff were friendly and the location is spot on. In our expereince here there wasn't really anything bad about the place that stood out. Food was good depending on where you ate, prices a little high (expected for a resort). We didn't spend much time by the pool or eating in as we were off driving around the island. NEGATIVES: It was windy.... very windy but I don't think TBR can control this but just be aware that the location is out on a sort of point at the top of the island so wind will be a problem sometimes. What really annoyed me was the US$25/N resort fee which covered a number of useless things as well as parking, WIFI, beach towles etc. It must be a USA thing, but $25/n is a rip off as the car park was pretty full and at times it took a while to find a spot, and there was a bit of a walk back to the hotel. Free WIFI is pretty much standard fare these days in any resort and being given a 'towel token' to swap for a towel is silly. Overall this is a good hotel and we enjoyed our stay. Clean, comfortable, large rooms and nice location. If the resort fee was closer to the $10-15 mark it would feel like less of a rip off. It is a bit of a drive (20-30mins) to the closest 'large town' so dinners require a drive or at resort.

I am so glad we did. All the negative reviews about the resort being \"long in tooth\" and \"in need of updating\" were put to rest when we walked into our deluxe ocean front room on the forth floor on the west wing. We had a beautiful view of the resort and ocean. The room was clean with plenty of space. The room seemed freshly painted or atleast painted in the last few years, carpet was clean and seemed newer. Beds very comfortable, TV was a HD 42inch flatscreen with limited cable channels, but in Hawaii we didn't watch much TV. There was a minifridge but no microwave which was pretty much the only negative thing about the room, Bathroom was large, with double sinks, granite counters, big closet, bathtub/shower, luxury hawaiian shampoos and soaps, lots of fresh towels. We were greeted warmly everywhere we went. Our maid was excellent. She noticed we had kids with us and our room was stocked with extra towels and tolietries for the remainder of our visit. Room service and the restraunts are pricey but on par with the other resorts in Hawaii. We ordered a sandwich plate late ($19) and it was enough for two people. I liked eating at Ted's Bakery and the shrimp trucks which farm there own shrimp and serve'em fresh both 3-4 miles from the resort. Parking isn't great but 100 percent better than in Waikiki, I didn't spring for the valet though since self parking is included in the resort fees of about $26 a day but again, parking in Waikiki, even in the hotel you're staying at could be about the same, at $20-$30 a day. But for me it was the location and beauty of the North Shore that truly won me over. It really is \"true\" hawaii. Head 15 mins west for a good restraunt selection and real Hawaiian soverniers. Head 15 mins east and check out the Polynesian Culture Center, especially if traveling with children. There is a great lagoon on the Turtle Bay's property and a few great beaches within a 5-15 min drive including Waimea Bay where you can jump off rocks and Sunset Beach with nice soft sands and good body boarding waves. My kids loved the pool and waterslides and the small on site arcade. Plenty of shops onsite as well and lots of fresh fruit stands close to the resort. I tried Papayas, dragon fruit, passion fruit, pinapples, guavas, and fresh coconut juice. All amazing and let's you know you're in Hawaii.

As we stayed here 12 days, we were very surprised that not one single person on their staff ever really got to know us. We weren't expecting them to remember our names, but at least recognize us at the pool after we spent a few days with the same waitress and tipped generously. It was like she never served us the next day we saw her, and the same goes for the other staff. Kind of bizarre as we go to Caesar's in Vegas every year and the staff remembers us from the year before!

It was the 2nd leg of our 3 leg trip (Las Vegas, Hawaii & San Francisco) so we wanted to stay somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki so that we could relax and experience true Hawaii. The resort itself is very impressive, there is lots to do in terms of activities, there are hiking trails that we did 3 or 4 times, Horse riding lessons, Surfing Lessons, Kayaking and free activities including Lei making: We had a surfing lesson for $75 each for 2 hours, which was good but I got sea sick! The pool area fantastic but the private beach is nothing to write home about, the snorkeling is poor (go to sharks cove instead) and you have to get down there early to get a lounger with an umbrella (if you\u2019re fair skinned like me you\u2019ll need one) The rooms were just OK, we were a bit disappointed when we first arrived so we asked to see an upgraded room (we were happy to pay) the \u201cupgrade\u201d was exactly the same room and view but with probably an extra foot of balcony for $25 a night\u2026we chose to decline. The rooms were clean but very basic, there was plenty of wardrobe space, a nice big TV, Tea and Coffee making facilities, a fridge, iron and a big bed, but the bathroom was cramped and old, the d\u00e9cor very dated. We\u2019d love to have been able to afford to stay in one of the beach front villas or the bungalows but we\u2019d have been adding a few extra zero\u2019s to our stay if we had. The hotel staff were not great, no-one acknowledged it was our honeymoon, let alone receive any form of congratulations. It\u2019s obviously a hub for honeymooners from all over the world which I think they take for granted. No-one was particularly rude to us, they just appeared to be a little unapproachable on occasion. We also really begrudged paying the $25 per day \u201cresort fee\u201d. We knew about it before we travelled (after we\u2019d booked) but just couldn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t have factored the fee into the overall cost of the holiday. For your $25 you get WiFi access in your room (we used this every day) a paper (never saw this), use of a snorkel for 1 hour per day (we already had our own)\u2026I can\u2019t remember what else was supposed to be included but we certainly didn\u2019t benefit from any of it. There is a good selection of restaurants and bars at the resort; Opa\u2019s (on the beach) was lovely, 21 degrees north absolutely fantastic, a must for anyone celebrating a special occasion. Leonardo\u2019s do a great takeaway pizza but I was sick on the night that we ate in (dodgy scallop). We only had breakfast at Lei Lei\u2019s but it was lovely. The Hang Ten bar does the best cocktails and burgers and the Ahi (fish) sandwich/burger was the nicest thing I had all holiday! Downside is that everything is very expensive due to being a resort, we brought breakfast cereals and milk from the local Food Land and ate in our room on most days. Also whilst we were there some renovation works were going on in the main lobby which we were told about 1 day prior to travelling. This was OK as it didn\u2019t affect our rooms but what we weren\u2019t told was that the main Bar was also in the Lobby and was closed for the entire duration of our stay. This would have been OK but unfortunately it was the only bar open past 9 pm. We were told that the hang 10 bar was open until 10 pm but when we went to get a drink after our dinner one night at 9:30 we were turned away as they were closed. We were in bed before 10 pm most nights as we didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. Ultimately it wasn\u2019t the end of the world but it would have been nice to be able to go for a quiet drink after dinner and not have to go straight up to our room. Whilst the resort is secluded you can still get about without having to hire a car. We got the bus to local towns a lot, the bus stop is within the resort walls, they very frequent and good value for money (you get a free return if you travel back within 2 hours) If you do get the bus or hire a car you must go to Haleiwa; it\u2019s an excellent local town with lots of shops & restaurants along with the infamous Giovanni\u2019s shrimp truck \u2013 a must, the best shrimp I\u2019ve ever had. Other areas on the bus route include Sunset Beach (where all the locals go surfing) and Sharks Cove (opposite Food Land) which is fantastic for snorkelling \u2013 be careful of the strong current against the rocks when you get in though). If you do hire a car (and you can do it at Europacar at the resort by the day) I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Dole Pineapple Plantation and Pearl Harbour \u2013 it\u2019s an emotional day but worth it, get there early if you do go, it\u2019s free to get in but you can make a donation. Overall we had a great time in Hawaii and would love to go back. The locals are so friendly. I would recommend Turtle bay but be prepared to spend a lot of money.

Turtle Bay is not a secured resort. They have Condos next door and several residents come right on the beach from there Condo. I used an outside company for my wedding and was absolutely beautiful and private. We got married at Sunset at Stables Beach.

I'm a photographer and I was shooting a wedding in Honolulu. We stayed at Turtle Bay to get away from the noise, traffic and over-saturation of Waikiki Beach. It definitely fit that bill - Turtle Bay is a pretty large resort sitting on a quiet, secluded peninsula with views of the ocean from pretty much every side of the hotel. The location is really tough to beat. It's quiet, there's a nice cove to where you can go swimming with a good sized beach and plenty of beach to walk in either direction. The grounds are nice and the restaurants have pretty good food, albeit at a premium price. There are a couple of shops with the expected items like resort wear, souvenirs and sundries. The nearby town of Haleiwa on the North Shore is a great place to go for a few local restaurants and shops and to see the sea turtles come up on the beach. Also a great place to surf, obviously, and the views are awesome of the waves. The Dole plantation is reasonably close too. The staff was just O.K. They weren't rude or anything, just... \"disinterested\". We received no information about the resort, the grounds, activities or the restaurants or anything when we arrived and the desk clerk seemed rushed (even though we were the only ones checking in). Service in the restaurants, especially at the \"Ola\" restaurant on the beach, was definitely much better and more personable, but overall I was underwhelmed by the service. Where the largest problem comes in is with the price vs. value comparison. The rooms are just so-so. Clean, but definitely dated. The bed was comfy and the room was a good size but the space could be better utilized, maybe with more comfortable chairs or a sitting area. No refrigerator or mini bar in the room. Plenty of closet space too. The fixtures in the bathroom are old, grout in the shower tiles and bathroom floors were stained and dirty and the furniture on the balcony was old, worn and pretty cheap. It was definitely better than your average \"Best Western\", but not much. As for the ocean view, about 70% of the view from our \"Deluxe Ocean Front\" room was the roof of the convention center below. This was a pretty big disappointment for us and exposes a pretty major general design flaw in the hotel. Walking around the grounds we noticed that nearly all of the rooms on the lower 4 floors of any of the room towers would have the same problem as ours, since the hotel juts significantly from the bottom of the room towers on almost every side. If you are on the higher floors you could look over the roof below with a more clear view of the ocean, but on the lower floors most of what you see is the dirty flat top of the roof below. Seems to me someone should have thought of this when designing a premium hotel in such an amazing location with the potential for near 360 degree views of the ocean form every room, but hey - I'm a photographer not an architect. Additionally, there is a fair amount of construction currently going on at the hotel. They're putting in a new lounge and doing some roof repairs. We weren't told about any of this when making the reservations or when checking in, though there were signs posted throughout the resort. As a result some areas are closed to guests. They did the work in the middle of the day when most people were out and about so it was not a major inconvenience, but it's worth noting. Overall, we would not stay there again. Since we were there in the off season, we apparently got a \"deal\" at $215 a night (plus a resort fee of course) and frankly, it's maybe worth half THAT price. We're not typically all that nit-picky when it comes to resorts, as long as they are reasonably clean and offer a good amount of amenities for your dollar. In this case it was exactly that lack of value for price that really bugged us most about this place. You could certainly stay at a worse resort, but you could also stay at a much better one, especially for the price.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDated with a cheap 'tart up'\u201d", "Author": "Time2venture", "ReviewID": "UR119786017", "Content": "After being spoilt at the Trump Hotel, my partner and I headed over to Turtle Bay for my best friend\u2019s wedding.

After reading Russel Brandt\u2019s book where he describes his stay at Turtle Bay during the filming of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (The Hotel is nothing like this movie FYI) we were expecting bland, but it was worse than we had feared. The Hotel staff were unhelpful at check in and the Porters did not immediately offer to assist us with our bags, instead watched us drag them to the check in counter. The rooms are BADLY dated. The walls are a putrid green colour that makes you look unhealthy. The grout and sealants have all deteriorated. The bathroom and \u2018kitchenette\u2019 (?) area adjoin which I thought was a little group. For their age, the bathrooms are clean. The bedrooms have received a minor \u2018makeover\u2019 but are still very bland and average. There is a noticeable lack of art on large blank walls. The staff leave a stuffed animal on your bed for \u2018adoption\u2019. I thought this was a bit cheeky and was curious to know how many people had taken it assuming it was a free gift. I also thought it was a little unhygienic to leave a toy, handled by who knows how many people, next to your pillow! If you are going to stay at this resort definitely hire a car, otherwise you will be stuck there. It\u2019s also really windy on this part of the island! I was also disappointed that the Bride and Broome were not better looked after by the Hotel. Their wedding coordinator was lovely but there was no \u2018special treatment\u2019 for having a wedding at the resort (a complimentary drink, room upgrade ... anything!). The positives, our view was amazing, we stayed on Level 2 and were very close to the ocean we could hear the waves crashing (there is a sliding door.... but not really a balcony. Balconies come with superior rooms but aren\u2019t worth paying for). There are a lot of activities offered by the resort. The grounds are beautiful.

Last time we stayed in a nice hotel room, this time we spoiled ourselves and stayed in one of the beach cottages (because we booked very early in the year, we got a 25 % discount). It is almost impossible to be closer to the ocean if you are not on a boat. It really looks like on the web site and the sound of the ocean and birds is so soothing. Room: Top notch bed (great mattress), large bathroom, decent furniture, great lanai where we had multiple room service dinners and breakfast. Safe, closet, coffee maker, TV, bath robes, slippers, umbrellas, personal fridge (in addition to mini bar). Daily FRUIT delivery, e.g. 2 bananas, or 2 apples etc. Location: look right at the ocean from your bed and enjoy the silence away from the buzz of the hotel/pool. Outside are hammocks that we used religiously to watch the stunning sun sets. Pool: we never used the main pool but the small pool with the water slide (fun and warm!). Hot tubs are nice; very hot and crowded. Pool menu is limited but some good choices like fish tacos. Restaurants: we love Ola, the restaurant right by the beach. Luckily most people don't want a table in the sand so we got it. It's open air, great fish, salads, service. Make sure to book on a Sunday night as all other restaurants will be closed. Five stars for Ola. As my husband is on a gluten free diet, we never tried any of the other restaurants but had room service from 21 which was very good. The Italian place looks good but the interior looks very 80s. We had breakfast there once, sitting outside, which was good. Hale'iwa has a number of restaurants and we ate at Joe's. We also tried the shrimp trucks which were surprisingly expensive. While Romy's was excellent, I discourage you to go to Giovanni's. They were the first truck but the people who cared seem to have left (Shrimps totally overcooked and a coconut drink was 5$$$$!). Bad attitude. Beach: great beach. Calm bay where we swam most days, rented a paddle board and enjoyed lying on the beach. It's beautiful and relaxing. Only minus is for the staff by the beach. I'd say there is a bit of an attitude to give you a beach chair, carry it and hand out towels - even though you pay a heft resort fee. Something needs to happen here. Not sure if the little beach shack/store belongs to the hotel; they absolutely don't care and don't know anything in that shack; disappointing. Other attractions: there is great kayaking on the river in Hale'iwa. Avoid the kayak rental opposite Joe's (right in the harbor). Unfortunately, they don't like to \"serve\"; we are not asking for a smile but don't be in a bad mood. There is another place close to the main road by the bridge that looked like it had a lot of variety; the river also looks good for paddle boarding. The north shore is amazing. It's quiet, windy (but pleasant), you can walk on beaches for hours and just feel nature. We saw a monk seal pup on the beach. My husband played both golf courses and thought it was decent. There are bikes for rent and tours available. We had massages that were wonderful, and I took four yoga classes which were of exceptionally high quality and attended by many locals. GREAT JOB!

We'd recommend you rent a car when you stay on the island. Although the resort is great, there is so much to see and do while you are there. We went to the Polynesian Cultural Center, where you can see the show \"Ha, the breath of life\".

Besides having the small bay for swimming and the lovely pool area, we had a fabulous time on the Segway and Kayak tours. These are separate activities and unique.

It was busy while we were there, but it never seemed too crazy. The beach was relatively uncrowded early in the mornings and the pool seemed to clear out in the late afternoons. I really loved how everyone gathered in the evenings to watch the surfers and the sunset. The location is really almost magical and it is what makes this resort worth the price. We had an ocean-front deluxe room which afforded an amazing view accompanied by the sounds of crashing waves all night. Perfect for sleeping! The main part of the room seems to have been renovated somewhat recently, but the bathrooms obviously had not. As others have noted, the bathroom was very dark and everything was very outdated, though it was clean. The beds were very comfortable and our request for feather-free pillows and comforter were accommodated quickly. Much of the staff was very friendly and efficient. The valet retrieved our car very quickly and housekeeping was very fast. Service in the restaurants and at the pool, however, is terrible, with the exception of Ola, the beach-front restaurant, which was a great place for lunch. We had the breakfast buffet in the mornings and that was by far the best food service we had during our stay. Coffee was brought and refilled quickly, but the staff seemed harried, even thought he dining room was rarely full. At the pool, you had to be served by one of the servers. For some reason, you could not order and receive a drink directly from the bar. We were able to order drinks from the bar, but had to wait for them to be brought to us by the pool. Very strange. We had two dinners at the resort - one at Leonardo's, the Italian restaurant, and one at 21 Degrees North, the \"fine-dining\" restaurant - and service and each was seriously lacking. At Leonardo's, we made reservations and were seated at 8pm. We then waited for almost 20 minutes before anyone stopped to take drink orders or bring us bread or water. My husband had gotten up to ask the hostess if there was a problem when the waiter finally arrived at our table. When I told him my husband had just gotten up to inquire about the service, he asked if he should just come back when my husband returned. I told him that probably wouldn't be such a good idea and asked that he go ahead and bring our drinks. It took quite a while for us to get our drinks and appetizer, and then even longer for us to get our food. The food was good, basic red sauce Italian, but not great. The next night we ate at 21 Degrees North. The atmosphere at this restaurant is certainly more upscale, all adults, and actually quite sophisticated. Unfortunately, we had service problems similar to those the night before. We made reservations and were seated at 8pm. The dining room was not very busy. We were brought water quickly, but then again waited at least 20 minutes for our waiter to appear. He only seemed to be serving two other tables, so I'm not sure what the issue was. We joked that perhaps he was also cooking. Once he took our order and brought the drinks, service was much smoother, but making a table wait for 20 minutes before initial contact is really unacceptable. The food here was excellent though. We opted to eat in Haleiwa the third night. Overall, I loved Turtle Bay because of the location, and I would probably stay here again.

The large king sized bed was very very comfortable. The resort was going through a remodel of some of its restaurants and as a result your options were more limited. They did have Hang 10 open later to compensate a wee bit. The resort made up points the next day and the rest of our trip. The resort was on the most perfect northshore location. Great views all around. our balcony was large and had an ocean view. Our stay included breakfast at the buffet.was amazing! Fresh-to-order omelets or egss, fluffy warm waffles, a great side selection that varied slightly every morning, fresh fruit, juices. I would recommend it to everyone who stays. It is expensive if it is not included in your stay, about 28.00, but as a result we didn't eat a big meal until dinner because of the choices and options that they provide.

Our room had a nice ocean view (i think all the rooms do), but it wasn't as clean as I would have liked it to be. The carpet felt really dirty underfoot, sticky~ possibly from the salt air? The room definitely needed refreshing- new carpet, paint etc. the bathroooms are outdated, old and very DARK! My 4 year old asked \"mommy, is this a junk hotel?\"... I absolutely adored the spa boutique which carried a bunch of beautiful yoga outfits and beach attire. And the toiletries in the room are TDF! I normally won't touch the hotel toiletries, but these were special and had a yummy coconut lime scent! Very tropical! The pool is average, and the on-site restaurants weren't that appealing. We drove to Ted's Bakery down the road near sunset beach, it's a hole in the wall, run down building, but they had yummy take out and pastries. We ate at Hukilau Cafe, it was crowded and not air conditioned, but the food is good and service fast. All in all, TBR was worth the discounted price I paid to stay here. This was a quick weekend getaway for our family. If you are thinking of paying their regular prices I would highly suggest looking at the Turtle Bay Ocean Villas that are across the hotel, they look alot newer! Or maybe look into a private vacation rental. If you are looking for a pristine, well maintained, lush resort this is NOT it. If you are looking for a resort on Oahu, try ihilani or your best bet is probably another island!!

Lovely tropical bath soaps, shampoo & lotion. Privacy sign was consistently respected - an almost unheard of event anywhere else! After the first couple of days, I could nap without concern! The restaurants were uniformly gorgeous, staffed with personable, competent wait-staff who served pleasing entrees that were competitively priced with other in-hotel restaurants on Oahu/Honolulu and without long lines. Ditto the coffee service bar in the lobby. Service personnel were consistently polite, friendly and prompt. We used valet parking, bellmen, cleaning service, calls to housekeeping, dining & spa reservations, towel service by the pool and shopped in both gift shops. Janice at the spa delivered the best scrub experience I've ever received (their Signature chocolate/coffee). I wasn't comfortable during the Pineapple pedicure - no spa chair so the soaking angle was awkward for the 10 min soak; I was self conscious in just a robe in their unisex, public, outdoor spa area where the world walks by. I would have gladly sacrificed the view for more foliage. We didn't click into the value of the Enterprise Rental car booth in the lobby until after we'd left; I was a tag-along on my husband's business trip & carless most days.

This is not a huge deal because we prefered hitting Ted's Bakery for breakfast and various beach stands for lunch.

Every bit of the grounds is taken up by the structure of the hotel, not much left for natural beauty - which also leads to lots of people, like a Waikiki hotel on the North Shore.

We had a basic room which are very large clean and tidy with a nice view of the ocean. The rooms were so nice and quiet, we didn't hear anyone in the rooms around us. We had a bad experience with a taxi driver, trying to get to Turtle bay so I really think this resort should offer some kind of reasonably priced shuttle service. They do offer a service but the cost was going to be around $160. Taxis cost around $130 to get you from the airport to Turtle Bay anyway. On the way back we booked a fixed price taxi ($85), which I got from the Oahu forum here on Trip Advisor. I can't for the life of me remember the name of this guy, but if you search for fixed price taxi in the forums, you'll come across him. Definitely the way to go. The resort is beautiful with lots of food options so you could not leave the resort if you didnt want to. When we first arrived we went to the bar around the pool but found the prices a little too much and the food options not so great so decided to explore. We went to look at the golf course and came across Lei Lei's which overlooks the Fazio golf course. Once we found Lei Lei's we never left. Lei Lei's is not part of the actual resort but is on the grounds and just a few minutes walk. This place has awesome food, reasonably priced drinks and the best staff - all staff were so friendly and really made this place. One night we met the manager of Ola's, he was having dinner there - what does that say! The other thing we loved about this place was that there weren't tourists there, it was all locals. We met so many nice people here night after night. We took an off road segway tour which I have to say the price was a bit steep at $99 each for a one hour tour but was the best thing we did. We were the only people booked on the tour so we had a private tour and those things are so fun to ride and it was beautiful to ride through the trails around the resort property. The resort property is so big that there are various walking trails you can take - some quick and easy, others a bit longer but the trails are all marked so you don't get lost. There are also a heap of quiet beaches that you can walk to around the property if you prefer the ocean to the pool. We did a ATV tour at Kualoa Ranch which is where lots of movies and tv shows are filmed. It's a beautiful place and you should go and visit. If you don't have a car to get around you can hire mopeds. But if you don't feel safe doing this, Oahu has a bus system called The Bu and it only costs $2 one way. There are a few different buses but basically you can go around the whole island on the bus. Just be aware there are LOTS of stops so a trip that would take 15 mins to drive there can take 30-45mins on the bus but it's a great, cheap method of transport. The bus has a stop on the turtle bay property and you can get timetables online or from the front desk.

Many folks from our party noted that they waited by the pool for over three hours before anyone came to ask them if they wanted to order something. Other folks complained that the shuttle service to and from the golf course never came after requesting for over 15 minutes. If the service was just a little better, this resort/hotel could be five star fabulous. The grounds are beautiful, nothing else like it on Oahu, they have a great golf course, and the golf course resturaunt is fabulous. The food served at the pool is also delicious (if you can get someone to serve you). One thing that did bother us was the breakfast buffet. There used to be child prices and adult prices. Now its' just the same price whether or not your are 4 years old or 44 years old. So puzzling because we know families that specifically avoided eating there because of this. There is no way a 4 year old kid is going to eat $28 or so worth of food.. Anyway, we may come back, just because options outside of waikiki are limited.

Turtle Bay Resort is absolutely beautiful. The beach was not much for swimming in my opinion, but I did spend a little time out there snorkeling and wading in the ocean. Most of the beach in the area is surrounded by rock and coral putting most people in the same general locations. Regardless, it was a great location. I was a little disappointed with the parking. As guests of the resort I was hoping we would have priority parking over the general public, however, when we returned from our day excursions throughout Oahu, we often would have difficulty finding an open place to park. The general public can park in the lot the same as guests, and the beaches are public so the privacy encourages people from outside the resort to come. Additionally, I was greatly disappointed to find several of whom I assumed to be tourists doing drugs in the parking lot. As my wife and I were walking to our vehicle to go to Honolulu, we had the strong scent of marijuana float across the parking lot and later saw a few stoners with what I assumed was a marijuana cigaratte coughing it up. Aside from this the only other issue I had in my week stay was on billing - I was charged for my private surf lesson three times in the initial bill. I believe the issue has since been resolved, but because I had a flight to catch I had to complete the billing on good faith as the front desk could not complete the billing until the concierge desk returned from the evening. Expect to pay to eat at the resort. Alcoholic beverages cost me on average $10 each, and meals cost me on the low end $50-60 for dinner for two. I did pay over $100 for a dinner for two at 21 North. I recommend stocking your fridge for an extended stay or there are nice places to dine in Hale Iwa. These issues may dissuade you, but know our stay was the best we've had in a long time (on par with our stay at the Willard). I would definitely go again to the Turtle Bay Resort.

I booked two separate packages and asked them to merge the two over a year in advance (never happened), to ensure the transitions would be smooth and easy. The packages included some amenities such as rental car (which had to be extended- thank you to enterprise for doing all the leg work to make that easier than expected), daily breakfast, chocolate covered strawberries & champagne (which I unexpectedly had to call and schedule for them to bring to the room), massages, kayaking tour, and a meal at 21 degrees north. After expressing it was my honeymoon (multiple times), our first room was 2 queen beds (rather than the King I requested). Which I was told could be changed the second day, the second day comes and they say it would be impossible to change because they are sold out. We also had to call to see when they were delivering the chocolate covered strawberries, kind of kills the romance/surprise. The kayaking tour was \"eh\", it would be really fun and excellent for a beginner. Part of the tour included hiking to spots my husband and I had already hiked at on the hotel property. SPA LUANA IS AMAZING! Our couples massage was romantic, relaxing and on a beautiful cabana on the beach, the spa offers lots of amenities before and after the service as well. The 5 course dinner at 21 degrees north was excellent, and they really took care of me by making accommodations for my food allergy, great service. Whenever there was any kind of error they would blame someone then say they would take care of it (and call us back), and we were never called back nor was anything taken care of. The pool was packed with families (lots of children under 12 in the hot tubs all day and all night), very little opportunities for romance or privacy anywhere outside the room. The pool bar/grill \"Hang Ten\" provided great service, great food, and some delicious drinks (get the Fish tacos!! sooooo good). Overall, the resort itself has beautiful views, but the staff is not helpful (sometimes not competent), and certainly not friendly (even though we were kind, friendly, and respectful).

No doubt about it this property is in a beautiful location and the cottages themselves are lovely inside. Though the cottages are not singular, they are sixplex units, they're very spacious, with dreamy beds to sleep on. Vaulted ceilings make it feel so airy and the wall of windows, the lanai and the ocean beyond are gorgeous. The desk area is good, nice comfy upholstered seating. The closets are miniscule but the bathroom is huge! The tub is bliss, plenty big for two - but the lack of a grab bar near either tub or shower in a bathroom is ludicrous, in one that is all slippery marble - idiotic. However it's a pretty bathroom. We had some issues with our privacy and the meaning of the 'privacy please' sign. We had issues with access, I have mobility restrictions and found much of the place to be inaccessible. It was not the best or worst of accessibility issues I've faced, but the simplicity of correction and the safety are items of importance for this hotel. Cars parked in the access aisle, construction, slow room service that delivered cold food. Staff members grumbled a lot about management - We enjoyed one fine meal at Ola, the restaurant on the beach - it was excellent, but second time not so good. Construction on our building was unnanounced - unnerving. The slip of lawn between the cottages and the beach are quite popular with people passing by. The cute little turtle sitting on the bed with the \"I'm for sale\" note - ahem, I think it's tacky to do that. The polyester bathrobe? Mini bar - the whole checklist and so on - key to get in - those are just awful, but ours would not unlock so that I could verify inventory. Sofa had dirty smelly cushions, but when housekeeping cleaned the room they clobbered the bathroom with chlorine bleach - whew! Last, but not least - why on earth is a hotel claiming to be a true Hawaiian experience not serving Hawaiian jam and jellies? Check out was a real chaotic time - rain caused trouble - staff was very grumpy and slow. Floors in the lobby were so slippery, not a rug in sight.

We just returned from a 5 day staff at the resort and I can tell you, it was amazing!!! The rooms... We stayed in a King Ocean Front Deluxe. I've seen several reviews about this hotel being outdated and I can tell you that I've seen worse (and paid more!). The only thing that was horribly outdated were the tissue box covers and the soap dishes on the bathroom counters...they are puke-yellow and probably original to the hotel. If you are going to let this affect your stay at the hotel or from booking a room at this hotel, you are missing out. For us, we weren't only paying for the room, but paying for the location of this resort...and after sitting in Honolulu traffic for 2hrs, the location of Turtle Bay made all the difference in the world :) The staff... Wonderful! While unloading our rental car and walking up to the hotel, we were greeted by several staff members who were leaving for the night. Everyone made eye contact and made conversation. The concierge desk went above and beyond to answer our questions about available activities, as well as booking them for us. Food... It can get pricey, but there are ways to avoid that. We frequently ate at The Bay Club, but we would split a meal and have drinks....the meals are plenty big to split and feel satisfied! There is a gift shop located at pool level that has snacks, drinks, alcohol, and sandwiches. The coffee bar in the lobby has affordable snacks and drinks as well. There's also a grocery store a little further north from the resort. Must See... If you are in the area, a must is Pearl Harbor of course! It's free to enter, as well as visit the USS Arizona Memorial. However, tickets are a first come, first serve basis, so get there early! If you find yourself having to wait for your time slot, there are free museums to tour. There's a couple of snacks bars that have pretty affordable snacks and drinks. The Polynesian Cultural Center was amazing! We booked through Turtle Bay and it was effortless! We did the late entry Luau and show and it was a wonderful experience! The Dole Plantation was a neat place to visit...not too much to do, but it was free to park and enter. Cute little shops set up around their grounds and very affordable meals. All in all, a wonderful trip and a wonderful stay at this resort! If I had to make a suggestion to the resort about improvements or even \"warn\" future guests, I would say that it would have been nice to have been \"warned\" about the weddings that were going to take place. Our room faced the ocean, but also overlooked the wedding area, which is beautiful. The first couple of weddings were very quiet and beautiful, but the last one was extremely loud. If we would have known about this at check in, we would have moved our plans around and would have been out to dinner or at the pool bar that night..but not knowing, we made plans to stay in that last evening, watch the sunset, and sleep with the door open so we could hear the ocean one last night. Instead, our hotel room started booming at sunset and didn't stop for a few more hours after that, however didn't last too late and their music taste was similar to our's, so we found ourselves singing along to most of the songs anyways ;) But I'd definitely recommend future guests to ask about your room location and weddings at check in so you can plan accordingly :) This resort has it all.

I get a big kick out of flying all the way from DC and jumping in the ocean to look at DiamondHead. But Honolulu is a city, you know, and sometimes it's good to get even further away from it all. On Oahu, that would be Turtle Bay. So if you love Atlantic City, South Beach, and Santa Monica, you probably won't much care for this place. To get there you can take the bus, but really you want to have a car, because the scenery is lush, the waves on the north side are stunning, and there's always Chinaman's Hat, which I never get tired of looking at. There is only a handful (by which I mean, like, five) restaurants in the area other than those in the hotel, but one of them is Ted's Bakery, which by itself is almost a reason to go to the North side! But the location is spectacular precisely because the north side is so quiet and remote. The hotel juts out into the Pacific and is surrounded on three sides by water. It has a small unremarkable beach (but truly great beaches are hard to come by in Hawaii). I agree with some reviewers that the place seems a bit tired, but it definitely is not shabby; and I also know from experience that even an \"Ocean Front Deluxe\" room can mean looking out the ocean over the roof of other parts of the complex. But on two visits a year apart I found the rooms to be large, comfortable, and clean. Ola's restaurant is pricey, as you would expect, but we found the quality and service to be excellent. On a previous visit I had an unfortunate service experience at LeiLei's; but I wrote to the manager, he apologized and when we returned a second time we were warmly greeted and well-served. It is my impression that the quality and selection in the main dining room had deteriorated during the year between my visits, but maybe I just hit an off-day. Some reviewers have complained about the towel policy (you are given a \"towel card\" which you trade for a towel; lose the towel and you'll be charged a fee). But the towels are large and carry the hotel's name and logo -- I bet that a lot of those towels \"walked\" before the policy was implemented. I have been fortunate to visit all the major islands except for Lanai. One entirely unanticipated result of my stays at Turtle Bay has been to come to understand how beautiful Oahu is, and how much the north side must be largely unchanged from what it was 25 or more years ago. While to my taste the Big Island is \"true Hawaii,\" if your only destination is Oahu you will get a great idea of that, on a smaller scale, on the north side.

This would be a great place for kids (or others) to learn to surf as the waves are consistent and they run along one side of the resort, making for great photo opportunities.

Our room made poor use of available space and the painted plywood bathroom vanity was badly chipped and beginning to fall apart. There's no light above the shower and no exhaust fan. Tile damage was badly patched with mismatching tiles. The pool bar had a number of old analog TV's with plywood housings protecting the 80's technology from theft.

First off, I will note that if you like to have stuff to do besides golf or lay at the pool, you may not want to stay here too long. We stayed for a week and ended up leaving a day early because there is just not much to do on the North Shore. The North Shore made Maui (which is perfect and so laid back) look like it's crazy busy! But, the NS is beautiful and it's worth seeing, I just wouldn't plan on spending an extended amount of time there. Second, we were there on our honeymoon and our stay was given to us as a gift and was fully paid for 6 months before we arrived. When we arrived the front desk would not let us check in without calling the folks who paid for our trip, it was extremely rude and out of line since it was long paid for, and stessful as the gift giver was getting on a plane to fly out of Hawaii. I understand they need to keep a card on file for incidentals and I offered mine and it was still a big ordeal. It took us over 45 minutes before they would give us our keys. Third, the hotel needs major upgrades! Our room had peeling paint, leaky vents, and it was just not what you would expect for the prices they charge. However, the beds are fabulous, and it was amazing to go to sleep at night with the doors open and listen to the crashing of the waves. So peaceful. But - it was not all bad. Our dinners were amazing, and several gave us free deserts after finding out we were honeymooners, which was nice. The cleaning staff there is the friendliest group of ladies I have ever met, they were super sweet and always offered up an 'Aloha'. The beach @ TB was very nice and not too crowded, and it was awesome to be on resort property still because we could go down to the beach at night and not have to worry about being unsafe. And - you can't beat waitresses bringing you drinks and food pool side! So, if you enjoy golf, tennis, or surfing, Turtle Bay may be the place for you.

We had started off in Honolulu, went to Kona on the Big Island, then went to Kaanapali on Maui, and were going to finish it up visiting the North Shore of Oahu. We were so excited to stay at Turtle Bay Resort for the culmination of our trip...what a disappointment. The staff at the front desk was very courteous and gave us a room on the 6th floor. We had paid for an Oceanview Premium, but when we got to the room, we were dismayed beyond belief. The room had furniture that was clearly from the 1970s which was peeling and hand dents, and the paint on the shutters was peeling. The A/C also was not working and the room felt as if it hadn't been occupied in months. In fact, there was no \"Activities\" sheet in the room, and the in-room fridge was unplugged with the door open. There was a musty, not-been-aired-in-a-while odor that was not being helped by the non-working A/C. I used the phone to call the front desk, got transferred to housekeeping, and was told that it would take some time to send someone to my room. I called back 5 minutes later to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager but was on hold for about 5 minutes. So, I told my husband to grab all the suitcases and that we were going to head to the front desk because we were not going to stay in this room. This was NOT the way we were going to end our trip. I went back to the front desk and there was no one there with 2 front desk attendants. I spoke to the woman who had checked us in and I informed her of what had happened. She apologized for the fact that I had been on hold and that the A/C was not working in that room. She was going to place us in a room that was a lower price than what we had paid, and I said that that was fine as long as the rate of what I paid changed. Then, she stated that she could put me in a Junior Suite at no extra charge. You would think that this would be great, right? Well, when we arrived at the new room, it was indeed about 2.5 times the size of the previous room, and the A/C worked, but it still had old furniture and that musky odor! However, perhaps because it was a larger room, the odor wasn't as pronounced as in the original room. The bathrooms in both rooms were large, but severely outdated and desperately need to be updated. In the Junior Suite there was shoddy caulking around the shower head, and there was paint peeling from the shutters of the glass sliders. There was also a rust-stain from water that was clearly leaking from the A/C. The furniture smelled old, and after sitting on it for a while, my clothes smelled like it. I didn't put any of our clothes in the drawers because there was an overwhelming odor of old in them! The views from both rooms was wonderful, and the bedding was plush. The staff did their best as far as customer service is concerned, and even sent a bottle of champagne as apologies. However, a $39 bottle of champagne is not going to make up for the fact that I paid over $250 a night for a room with peeling paint and banged up furniture that hasn't been updated since before disco was king! The grounds are really beautiful, and there are many picturesque portraits that one can take. One night we went down to Happy Hour at the bar by the pool, and the live music was awesome! The snorkeling they have onsite is terrible. There are hardly any fish, and the water is not as clear as in Maui or the Big Island. It was nice to see the surfers, and we did go on a hike to the WWII bunker. We did stop by the Dole Pineapple Plantation, which was totally unexpected (literally decided to stop while driving by on our way to Turtle Bay Resort) and awesome!

The rooms are very nice and always in very clean condition with a nice smell. I would recommend that you get an upgrade if you can because it is totally worth it!! The first time we stayed here we got an upgrade and this will get you a room on an upper floor with a view of the popular lagoon-like beach and the rest of the ocean. This view is beautiful and at night you can leave the windows open and feel and here the ocean waves. The normal room that we got the next time was also very nice with an ocean view but it was on a lower level so we could see the roof of the restaurant below. The good thing about this room was that its balcony was larger. The restaurants in the hotel are pretty pricey but have very delicious food. If you don't want to eat at the hotel you will need to drive pretty far down the road to any other restaurants so its most likely you will eat at the hotel. The nearest restaurants are in Haleiwa. I would recommend Haleiwa Joe's :) The beach at the hotel is pretty nice in the lagoon-like area. The water is pretty clear and gets deeper as you swim more out, but its still a great area for the kids. We've seen sea turtles in this area so if you're lucky you might be able to swim with them...just keep your space because its illegal to touch them! Overall I LOVE this hotel and can't wait to go back.

The location is very secluded. Get a hire car if u can. We did not and all of the hire cars (except the most expensive) were taken. There is TheBus $2.50 which is a great service but you waste alot of time waiting around for. And make sure you ask for a transfer ticket which gives you free return travel within 2-3 hrs on same day. Food is pricey at the hotel's restaurant and the only Foodland is a 15 min bus trip. There is great snorkling, we saw turtels, colourful fish and eels, just off the beach. Waimea Bay was the best to swim at as not big surf season. And make sure you go shark swimming with North Shore Shark Adventures, it is awesome!! This place is very secluded, maybe do a day trip from Waikiki or if you have the money, stay in the deluxe ocean rooms. Staff members were average, as per previous review, Carol does need a refresher course in customer service. We ate at the Hang Ten Bar & Grill and had lunch at the bar and watched the staff member's continuously eat food from the section where they finish dressing the customers drinks, very unhygienic.

Turtle Bay was easily the worst of them, which is a shame, because it's in such a beautiful location. We booked at the hotel's parent company website (it's part of Preferred Hotels Group) and selected a rate which included daily breakfast and daily resort credit. We brought a printout of the confirmation, and yet the front desk insisted they had never seen such a package before and took 15 minutes to reverse-engineer the rate to make it match our confirmation. They could not, at check-in, promise to give us the credit or the breakfast we paid for in the rate, and suggested we check back later. A few hours later, when I returned to find new front desk staff, they still had no verdict, and were neither concerned nor apologetic for the confusion. In the end, after a few conversations, we got what was included in our rate, but not once did any front desk manager or employee apologize for the confusion; the resort staff, in general, made zero efforts to provide great service. The only exception: the waitresses by the pool bar were excellent and personable... they should be running the show! I hear the resort used to be pretty fabulous, but those days are long gone. The room had a fine view, but the furnishings were pretty tired and the bathroom looked like it hadn't been renovated in 10+ years. All of the food we ate was pretty standard, overpriced, uninspired resort fare (see my reviews)... especially compared to the amazing food one can find in Honolulu!

They were working on the roofs and something must have been blowing into the rooms because everytime I walked on the carpet for more than 10 minutes my feet were black. My laptop screen and keyboard (both white) also had the black sticky stuff on it. 2nd dissapointment. Their \"beach\" has very few umbrellas available for their customers, I don't know maybe 12-15, so if one wants to use an umbrella, they must be claimed quite early. And, people from other hotels in the area were coming over and using the hotels limited umbrellas. I recognize that these are public beaches but the hotel is certainly within its rights to only allow their hotel guests the use of their umbrellas. Also, the girl working the beach is not particularly pleasant. 3rd disappointment. Staff was just so-so at best.

This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in- the beachfront cottages are gorgeous!!! There are minor repairs that may need to be made- our closet doors came off the hinges and there was a crack in the sink- but it is far from being outdated as some other reviewers stated. The views were amazing from the room, and listening to the ocean outside your door every night is so relaxing. The bed was comfy and the room was always cleaned well. We ate at Lei Leis and Ola's. Ola's wasn't as nice as it looked in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" but the food was ok. They charged a $15 corkage fee when we brought champagne we received upon arrival. Lei Lei's was better but without the beach view. A few minor issues: -Cottages were a bit far from the rest of the resort and restaurants, which made it pretty difficult when we had to walk with all our laundry to the only washing machines on the 3rd floor of the hotel. The change machines did not work, and we had to wait for the front desk to give change. -Front desk usually had only 1 person working, even during busy times. The check in time took at least 10 minutes, so when waiting for something simple (like change for washing machines) it was very inconvenient. They should definitely employ more people for the front desk at all times. -No in-room movies in the cottages. The hotel is pretty isolated and everything closes early, so there is not much to do. We wanted to stay in and rent a movie for the night, but we were first told they were updating the system so try the menu again later. The next day we were told the cottages never had movies available. -Lots of time restrictions- Beach chairs only available 9-5; spa only open until 8pm and even when we tried to call at 7:45 pm to schedule a massage they were already closed; Slide in pool only open 9:30-5:30. For all the money we spent for our stay, we expected less restrictions. However, all of these minor issues did not hinder our stay.

We stayed in one of the Cottages which was again at first glance really nice. Views are lovely and not nearly as noisy as where we were coming from. I want to point this out right up front - Safety needs to be a bigger concern as the bathrooms in the cottages are an accident waiting to happen for anyone. They look lovely with all the marble on the floors, tubs, showers, and walls. There is not one single grab bar in the bathroom. Have you seen what water does when it gets on marble and you try to stand or walk on it. Upon checkin we noticed the front desk staff never smiled at all. Just git'er done and get them on thier way. We were told to follow one of the bell staff to our cottage and that person was nice and all smiles. We were told that at anytime we needed assistance to go anywhere on the grounds just give them a call and someone would come and help right away. He noticed my significant other was using a cane. We also said that we understood that we could have the use of their wheelchair while on thier grounds. We were directed to the bell desk to pick one up. So far so good. We went to dinner promptly after getting in our room and were told upon checkin that the concierge would be giving us a call to set up a \"convenient time\" for them to come by and welcome us. We placed the \"Privacy Please\" sign on the door and left knowing that they would call us to set up a time. When we returned from dinner we found that they had indeed entered the room while we were out and left a few \"gifts\". 2 t-shirts advertising Turtle Bay. So right away they let us know that our privacy was of no concern. To top that off the t-shirts were wrong size so we can't use them. That simple phone call from them might have taken care of that. We proceeded to check out the grounds while using the wheelchair as I figured it would be easier on her. It's a good thing we did since there are a lot of winding, up and down, paths to get to the resort main building. Not real friendly for a wheelchair. When we made it to the resort main lobby area we really noticed that they had used flagstone with 1 inch grout joiunts and was sealed with a slick surface. What were you thinking! We ate at one of the on property restaraunts and it was really good including the welcome staff and our server. Had a wonderful time at dinner there. The next time we went to that same restaraunt, this time for lunch, the welcome staff was great but we got a server that couldn't get the order right and didn't explain the special well enough to tell us that the nice piece of fresh fish you were getiing came \"smothered\" in sauce. Who does that to fresh fish? He then proceeded to say we could \"scrape off the sauce. Not. Since my order was wrong we decided to leave well enough alone. I paid the $8.75 for 2 Iced teas before I left since he said we wouldn't be charged for those orders. We decided one morning to have a breakfast at the golf club since they said they were open for breakfast. 3 pastries does not constitute breakfast. Once again we had to leave to find food. Remember when I said they would assist us in getting around the grounds to see things? I called the next day and was told that they would be happy to do that as long as we called when they were \"not busy\" Who were they so busy with that they can't honor what they say to the already paid guests. Oh Joy! One time (there were several times) we were in the parking area and they have access ramps at both ends of it. Kudos for that. But we noticed that everyday someone would park and block those access ramps. We noticed that the paint was really faded on the spots and you really couldn't read the \"no Parking\" which could have been better if there was good paint or even a sign. We asked the security guy who comes around if there could be something done about that since we really needed to use that access. His response was something to the effect of \"we tried leaving notes for the vehicles telling them they could be cited for parking there but nobody ever does anything about, so there is really nothing I can do\". Apparently it happens all the time and they got tired of telling people. One other thing they do is for the parking permit they print your full name on the pass and you place it on your dash. These are in big letters. So everyone who walks by has your name and it is associated with your vehicle. I kinda don't like that. There were a few other things like the \"snacks in your room\" not lining up with what the inventory sheet for it says. The key that goes to the mini-bar didn't work either. Not that we wanted to use it at those prices but were curious. If you wanted to go to the front desk for something you have to either go the long way around the pool and then up the elevator and then back around. Or you had to go up the road, not on a walkway, actually in the road to get there. Try doing this if you have mobility issues or are in a wheelchair. One morning we woke up and had decided to have a nice \"in resort\" romantic day. We went outside to get some fresh air only to notice that a truck was pulling up in front of our cottage offloading new copper gutters to be placed on our cottage building. The workers off loaded all the gutters and proceeded to install them. Thanks to the resort for \"not letting any guests no about this\" We had 3 honey moon couples in our cottage building wanting some romantic time. Nice going guys. I was going to call the general manager from the business card they gave us when we checked in. I showed it to my wife and she informed me that we couldn't call him. I said, why not? She said it would be long distance since he died 6 months ago. Again, nice going guys. Can't you give us a name of someone who is actually alive. Checkout day was a joke! It happened to be pouring down rain and when we called the bell desk to send a cart to take our stuff up to the front desk area so we could load it in our car without getting soaked we were told we would just have to wait. I called our cottage concierge and told them what was going on and they said they would send someone right over. They couldn't beleive we were told that by the bell desk. Needless to say the guy that showed up to help us was not pleased. Grumbled a lot about them being too cheap to provide any kind of rain gear for them. It is the North Shore afterall. So finally at the front counter to checkout, as we are approaching my significant other is using the cane and walking very slowly, almost slips down with every step because the floors are so spippery with all that nice slick sealant I mentioned. The front desk is covered with plastic so that it doesn't get wet? The desk is 50 feet from any opening. Leaks?? We had to wait until they got logged in to do anything. Would I recommend? Nah, not to anyone I like until they get things fixed. I didn't mention that the room service breakfast we ordered was barely warm when we got it.

Pizza and salad at Leonardo's was very good, and the lobby barista was so convenient for coffee etc. Due to the heavy rains and thunderstorms, and the roof under repair, there was some \"indoor rain\" in some places.

We stayed in a beach cottage for 6 nights for our honeymoon. Overall, we had a good time (who wouldn't, it's Hawaii, and it was our honeymoon), but I don't think we'll be returning to the Turtle Bay Resort. Perhaps it wasn't a great pick for our honeymoon, but my husband really wanted to stay there after watching \"forgetting sarah marshall\" My thoughts: -Rooms: comfortable and clean. our beach cottage had a great view. huge bathroom, which we liked. feel like the resort may want to consider some decor upgrades, etc. just didn't have that \"luxury\" feel we were hoping for. -It was pretty irritating that we were not able to get a cottage with a King sized bed. We had two queen beds for our honeymoon. Didn't really feel like putting up a big stink about it while we were there though, so just kept the 2 queen beds, as they said there were no King bed cottages. -Free WIFI: Slow and unreliable and frequently cut out. -Business Center: they need to put a limit on how much time people spend in there. We tried to print our boarding passes in advance and had to wait over half an hour, as there was a whole family in there using the computers. -Service: crappy and not friendly. our card key (one of them didn't work), and to check in and get this fixed took about half an hour each. there are always lines to check in, and concierge is grumpy. our private VIP concierge was nice and friendly however. -Common areas: too many people. children everywhere (especially in places they shouldn't be, ie, in the hot tubs). we found it was hard to get a seat by the pool or into a hot tub, as they were packed with teenagers. -Parking: beach cottage parking lot always full. we got to park there one night our entire honeymoon. so, we had to walk across to the main lot (not fun) every time we wanted to use the car. -Food: service at the restaurants is great. the poolside bar has good service, but terrible food. Ola was really good. -Price: we didn't get a fruit basket despite it being our honeymoon, but did get a bottle of champage, two glasses of juice, and a Turtle Bay Tshirt for each of us.

This time around things seemed a little different, the buffets are gone and quite frankly the italian restaurant that has replaced it is fine if you want Pizza (the pasta is not as good) every night, we asked some of the staff members why the buffets were gone and were told they didnt know but said a lot of the staff have left as not as many people go to the new restuarant hence not so many tips, so it seemed the staff were puzzled by the decision. The breakfast was not as good either and the service we got was dreadful to ok'ish, one day the breakfast vouchers we were suppose to give to our waiter were left on the table as he/she did not even bother to come to our table to ask for tea/coffee/water, unlike last year when we were getting top ups after every mouthful of Coffee. The rooms were ok however not a patch on some of the waikiki upgraded hotels and do look like they need some money spent on the decor - and considering the price per day they should look more like a holiday hotel room and not a green box. So why would you stay here you may ask? - well you havent much choice when it comes to the north shore, and as a base its good to explore from, the swimming pool is ok apart from being constantly bombed or dived bombed by kids, the sunbed fight in the morning is great to watch when you see people out there as early as 7.30am reserving their sunbeds - often one lot in the shade and another in the sun. Food - do not eat in the Italian eat at Lei Lei's situated at the golf club - you must try the ribs. Ola's on the beach is also very good Breakfast - if you do get the vouchers for staying 5/6 nights then fine but dont pay the prices for the buffet its not worth it We will not be going back again, we looked forward to our return however was disappointed P.S. I am sure the manager will write some lame response when he should be saying yes we are changing the restaurant back to evening buffets and we are spending some money re upgrading the rooms.

We saw this deal on facebook, called turtle bay resort to book our reservation. However, we had called during memorial weekend, the reservation desk was closed, so we tried to book it online thru facebook.

I called TBR and explained that I'm a FB fan of theirs. I explained the situation how i was unable to book my reservation through facebook, they told me there's nothing they can do. i asked them if they could cancel my current reservation and re-book it for me. They said no, because i had booked an advanced purchase package which cannot be cancelled. it was frustrating explaining to them I don't want to cancel my trip, i just want to fix this problem. I will admit the reservation desk ladies were polite, but they were unable to help and they failed to help me understand why the problem was irreversible. A twenty minute phone call for $100 resort credit? i gave up, it's just silly.

Turtle Bay is just perfect. Not overly opulant, but a lovely, gracious resort in a wonderful setting on a peninsula - all rooms have ocean views. Clean, modern rooms with wifi, wide screen TV, small fridge was nice for drinks and snacks. The modest resort fee keeps you from getting \"nickel and dimed\" and includes parking, newspaper, beach umbrellas, towels and chairs by the pool and ocean, snorkel equipment, etc. Very gracious, helpful staff. The grounds are huge, and we did miles of hiking by the sea and through the woods. This is a quiet resort, so don't expect a lively night life - expect peace, quiet and restful beauty. We did a couples massage in the little cabana by the ocean - heaven! The spa is modest but adequate for a treatment or two. Delicous food at Ola's seaside restaurant and the on-site Italian restaurant. One of the nicest things is the location - in the cooler northern part of the island with a rural, \"real Hawaii\" flavor: easy nearby day trips to botanical gardens, old-fashioned surfer town, Dole Plantation, Polynesian Cultural Center, farmer's market on Sunday for snacks, fruit and gifts, shrimp farm shacks for outdoor lunch, and plenty of uncrowded beaches. The resort itself has a protected bay for swimming and snorkeling, nice because the water can get choppy when windy (we could sit on the lawn and watch surfers catch the waves!). Or, you can hike down paths to more secluded beaches. Resort has everything - golf, tennis, horses, surfing lessons, even helicopter rides, so you could just stay and be happy, but we liked the opportunity to both relax/enjoy the resort and leave to explore. It's about an hour's drive from the airport if you take the highway, but leave time to amble around the island on the small roads by the ocean and mountains - the beauty makes it well worth it.

It is true what they say - every room has a view of the ocean. It is very nice to sit out on the balcony reading or having breakfast. The pool is good enough. It's not bad, but its just a pool. There is plenty of space to lay out or to go swimming, but it lacks in many frills. What it lacks, it makes up for in service. Towels and cold water are provided pool side. However, I recommend ordering drinks directly from the bar. The pool side wait staff is friendly and professional, I just think the hotel needs to hire more. It took quite a bit of time to get food and/or beverages pool side. That's ok if you are just hanging loose, but if you wait until you need food or something to drink before asking, you'll feel disappointed in how long you have to wait. The ocean is right near the pool, and a great place to watch surfing. In the bay, the resort fee includes free snorking (1 hour per day) which I recommend taking advantage of at least once - especially if you have not done it. The bay is calm and a great place to go for the first time. Plus you'll see many fish and if you are lucky - a turtle! Ola is the beachside restaurant and worth taking advantage if you can. The food is good and you might be able to get a table right on the beach! Be weary of the chairs though as one of them stained my shorts! But I suspect that is a one off occurance because of something another guest did (my guess). But maybe worth checking (just in case I am wrong!). The inside hotel restaurants are ok. The italian place and the bay view place pretty much have the same menu. Bay view's is a subset of the italian place. The nicer restaurant looks better, but we didn't go there. If you have a car, I recommend heading into town to sample the local restaurants. There are plenty to choose from, so I will not detail here. That said, you wouldn't go wrong staying on property to eat if you are willing to pay a tad more. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly. The little gift shop next to the pool is a great place to get supplies at a reasonable price. They even sell beer and wine, which are nice to have on the balcony before heading to dinner. The sandwiches are a cheap alternative for something quick. Lastly, if you love to golf, you'll love the course here. Guests can play for $65 after 2:00, and that includes clubs, range balls, and 3 balls for the course. They sent me off by myself and I got done in 2hrs 15min. Given that I was on vacation with my fiancee, I was very appreciative that I was back to the room by 4:45 and ready to enjoy some more of the resort before dinner time!

We didn\u2019t stay in the actual hotel building so I have no clue about the rooms in the actual building. My wife and I went there on our honeymoon. We were there for 6 nights, and were the recipient of the \u201cstay 5 night get one night free program\u201d. I highly recommend this particular package if you can get it. Firstly, as far as price goes, these beach cottages are great. If these were located on Waikiki, they could easily go for twice the price, and they would probably still be a steal. The location is great, right next to the water and away from the more public pool and hotel areas. Parking can be a little difficult since there aren\u2019t many spaces and some of the locals seem to use the parking to unload/load surfboards (another great thing is that the cove seems to always have some surfers or stand up paddlers in it, which makes for great watching). The rooms are great, such high ceilings and very roomy! We had the two queen beds and we had more room than we knew what to do with. The bathroom is very nice and the finishes are great. The bathtub is huge, definitely a two man tub, if there is such a thing. Mattresses\u2019 are nice along with the bed frames, which are slightly larger than a normal queen bed frame, and they show a little wear, but nothing out of the ordinary. We didn\u2019t really use any of the internet, TV or movie ordering services, so I can\u2019t comment on those either. Housekeeping was great along with the concierge services that provided fresh fruit and ice each day. Housekeeping thoroughly cleaned the room each day with fresh sheets and they did a turndown service at night complete with macaroons, and chocolate covered macadamia nuts. The grounds at Turtle Bay are very well kept and are really beautiful, and the groundskeepers are very good at what they do. Dining: Dining overall was very good. We ordered room service one night and were really impressed with the prompt delivery and pickup, not to mention the food was great. The room service menu appears to be a smattering of dishes from each one of the onsite restaurants so it\u2019s pretty good. Prices were steep even for Hawaii, but hey it\u2019s a resort! That\u2019s how it works. The restaurants had very good service except for the Bay Club, but that has more to do with only having two waiters for the entire place, rather than willingness of the staff. You\u2019ll see resort pricing at each of the restaurants so be expecting 30-50 a meal or more, but the food is certainly worth it. We enjoyed every meal that we ordered. I know I was ragging on the service at the Bay Club, but the Kobe Burger there is really good. Part of the package that we got included a full breakfast buffet each morning, which was amazing. There is so much to choose from, and they have a chef that makes omelets, and they are out of this world good! You have to put the salsa on them. The salsa could possibly be the best salsa I have ever had, and I live in Texas, where there are Mexican places on every corner. Beaches: The Beaches there at Turtle Bay were excellent, and not very crowded. It might have been due to us being there during the week, and school not being out, but it was very pleasant. The beach on the East side of the resort is very placid and has some pretty good snorkeling, and you get two pair of gear for an hour a day for free which is pretty awesome. The beach in front of the beach cottages is very rocky and there isn\u2019t just a whole lot of sand. It also is a pretty busy habitat for crabs and the like. On the plus side, the entire time we were there it was never busy at all, so it could work out to be a nice place to relax. Pool Complex: The pool complex was also very enjoyable. The big pool was never crowded, and the water was nice and cool, and very refreshing. The slide pool was really nice but there are a lot of kids in it. My wife and I did slide down the slide and it was enjoyable. Not as much for us as the kids that used the pool. The poolside service was really good, Hang Ten, the restaurant located at the pool makes very good drinks. We didn\u2019t actually order anything to eat there but the drinks were very good. Overall my wife and I really enjoyed coming to Turtle Bay. I would definitely recommend this resort for any couple, and especially a newly married couple, as it gets you away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. The staff is friendly, there is no request to small or large, and it is a very relaxing resort getaway. The price is great as well, and the entire complex is so close to the water.

(I don't normally ding a property for one incidence of lousy service, but three or more in two days is enough to establish a pattern.) Groucho Marx's aphorism applies at the hotel proper. They are coy about telling you about the size of their balconies--ocean-front rooms have balconies too small to sit on. Don't know what the architect was thinking. Self-parking is included in your resort fee ($25/day), but there isn't nearly enough of it, and you are in for a bit of a walk. Get your own bottles of sparkling at the local Foodland, as the drink tab will be steep, even during happy hour. Still, they do have amenities (see photo). If you buy the golf package, make sure you play all of your golf on the Palmer; the Fazio is Ala Wai without customers. From the perspective of conditions, the Palmer course doesn't hold a candle to Poi'pu Bay (in Kaua'i, which is a real treat), but the service was immaculate, and that goes double for Lei Lei's (the golf course restaurant). The Palmer is female-friendly, being ~5,400 yards in length, but both sexes would do well to bring a few balls. If it gets close to the water, it will go in; the layout is a credit to Palmer's staff. I would recommend this place for an over-nighter, or if you are a surfie. The best plan is to bid aggressively on Priceline, as the rack rate is a bit high.

I am not sure how anyone could complain about this place. There is a beautiful view no matter where you are here. I am not saying everything was perfect but things on vacation rarely are. Hotels receive many guests and rooms will have a few imperfections here and there. I thought the rooms were very convenient. I liked the bathroom and the second sink in the separate dressing area. We made good use of the refrigerator. I personally loved the decor and thought the soft green walls were nice. I find it funny that people complain about the lack of pictures on the wall. Who needs pictures when you have that gorgeous view outside your balcony? We had a deluxe ocean front room and the big balcony is worth the extra cost. The only trick is getting one with a great view. I would suggest charging a bit more for the rooms on the 5th and 6th floor because they offer superior views compared to what you get on the lower floors. That way you would know in advance what you are getting and it would help with the complaints from those with the lesser views. I for one would be willing to pay more to ensure I had a room on the higher floors instead of crossing my fingers at check-in. We ate at all the restaurants and they were fine. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the Palm Terrace the most. The food was good and the view was even better. It was a great way to start the day. We also ate at Ted's Bakery up the road at Sunset Beach and it was delicious. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative this is your place. There isn't any nightlife here but that was OK with us.

That movie was probably the best thing that has ever happened to this hotel as many of the other guests I spoke to eventually stated that it was also the reason why they chose to stay at Turtle Bay Resort. Let me warn you that if that is why you are considering this hotel, you are much better off just driving up and seeing it (which will take all of 10 minutes to walk the whole property) and then staying elsewhere. The Hotel Room: I've read some of the positive reviews and it seems that those happy with their stays were in the ocean front suites. That must be the case because the hotel room we were in was so outdated and beat up that it was a little depressing. For example, the furniture has knicks and scratches all over, the A/C was leaking water, the window coverings were stuck open, etc. Let's just say it needs remodeling badly! There are a couple of positives: the bed was comfortable and the view was beautiful. The Staff: The front desk staff is not particularly friendly either. They asked how our stay was and when we told them, they waved us off with a \"too bad, hope the rest of your vacation gets better for you.\" The housekeeping staff, on the other hand, was very courteous. The Amenities: The amenities were a bit of a joke as well. Particularly for the $25 (plus tax) YES, plus tax, that you are charged daily for a resort fee. For example, two of the three pools were closed and the Jacuzzi jets were out of order. This wouldn't normally be a big deal except for the fact that there is NOTHING else to do here. There are no other amenities on the property unless you want to pay extra for golf or tennis. So, just call it a parking fee, which is what it really is. I would really encourage you to do your research before saying here. Their Website looks very nice and they make everything look high-end, but this is far from what we experienced. Granted, if you really want to stay on the North Shore, there aren't many choices.

We had come from spending 12 days on Maui and wanted to see a little of Oahu. We wanted to stay out of the busy Waikiki touristy area which turned out to be the BEST idea, but more on that later. We drove the 45 minutes from the airport to Turtle Bay and it was a decent scenic route towards the end along the ocean. Once we got there we noticed the lobby was very nice and if you saw the movie \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" you would recognize it right away. The people were very nice.... $15 a night for valet which I thought was a bit high. We were promised an \"Ocean View\" room and when we got to our room we were VERY disappointed. The rooms were old - no place to put your clothes (no dresser or furniture other then a desk and TV stand even though the room was very large) and the \"view\" was 95% blocked from a building. We could see the very tops of the Palm trees and about 2% of the water over the top of the building. I am not even sure what the building is, but later on i realized it was part of the gym/spa that was added. Either way - this was NOT an ocean view. I was annoyed but only there for 3 days and didnt have the energy to argue them about it. We spent the next day on the beach which was very nice and quiet. Umbrellas are limited and are positioned along the beach and not movable. If you do not get there early enough you will have to wait until someone leaves. The lounge chairs are old and uncomfortable. You are only allotted one towel per person. But the ocean is nice with the waves crashing on the rocks around it - and a little beach restaurant as well as a little refreshment hut very near by. The grounds looked very nice but we didn't spend much time by the golf course so I cant really speak of it. The pool area and pool was ok. Same uncomfortable lounge chairs, only 1 towel but more umbrellas. There is a little bar which was convenient and there was waitress service. There are a lot of options of restaurants which is nice and the breakfast buffet is good. All in all I would say that the hotel is a 2*-3* which needs some serious updating in the rooms. If you can get a really good deal to stay here then I would take it, but anything above $200 a night is to much. On our last day and on our way back to the airport we decided to go to Waikiki beach to see if we should have stayed there. We are glad we didnt. It was busy and loud and crowded and very touristy. The beach was PACKED. If you are young and looking for a big nightlife and more of a \"Social scene\" then this is your place. But if you are looking for a more quiet relaxing time, I'd stay outside of Waikiki. However, Waikiki did have some amazing shopping.

Golf club rentals were $45 (for the week, not a day- didn't know this). You can get an affordable round of golf in if you are military or a resident.. OR you can play a discounted rate after 2PM. You can also walk the 18 hole Fazio course after 3 PM for like $15. (The Palmer course is further out and does not allow walking- and you wouldn't want to walk it, anyway.) Beautiful walking trails to the left and right of the compound.. The best restaurant is Lei Lei's, which is actually the golf club house. I had a 24 ounce prime rib. To conserve money, my wife and I grocery shopped at Foodland and another place (both about 8 miles out. Most rooms come with a refrigerator.. nothing else. Restaurant dining on the resort is pretty expensive. I had a hamburger and fries for $16.95 while poolside, but it was good. Drinks are seriously expensive.. about $10.00 average. This place is a definite must visit. There is zero nightlife on the northshore. Zero. But most people don't go northshore for that. We had spa treatment one day. They tack on an additional 18% to the stated fee. My wife and I had 50 minute couples massage for $358. It was good but much pricier than I anticipated. One word of advise.. do not do the Luau.. everyone wants to do a Luau b/c it's Hawaii. We went to the Polynesian Cultural Center, which is Mormon operated. It was such a disappointment. $200 plus dollars and then they upsell you on everything. I mean everything.

It would have been nice if we had been warned there might not be any parking and offered some help. Once in our oom we were immediately greeted by a concierge. He was very pleasant and told us he looked forward to \"pampering\" us for the next few days. Call me anytime he said. Never saw him again. When we did call the concierge it took several tries to get someone to answer. We told him we wanted reservations to a Luau at the P.C.C. He said, \"Oh, I used to work there. They never sell out. You don't need reservations\". Upon his advice we went to the PCC around 12:30 the next afternoon, they do not open until 12 and were told that they were already sold out. We had to make reservations to come back the next day. By the time we got back to the hotel we had wasted almost a whole day of our vacation waiting, and then driving back and forth, including a trip to a restaurant he recommended which is a whole other story. Finally, the beds. Unlike even some of even the cheapest hotels they do not put the blanket between two clean sheets. Since the blankets are probably not washed that often your only option is a sheet and questionable blanket. Also, they only use flat sheets not fitted for the bottom. Most mornings we woke up with nothing between us and the bed. Very gross. For the money they charge you would think they would at least spring for some fitted sheets. Also, the room was not cleaned very well. They left a cup of lemon water sitting on my nightstand for two days.

However, we must have discovered \"true Hawai'i,\" as we lost track of the days and realized at about the time our flight was scheduled to leave, that we were supposed to be on it. It seems the hotel had been trying to contact us all day, but we didn't have our phones with on the beach or on our kayak trip, and therefore were clueless. Instead of being angry with us, they just let us stay in our room while they upgraded the guests who had reserved our beach cottage. Not sure how they could have upgraded them, as the cottages are amazing, but I'm grateful they did and truly sorry we messed up the plans of those folks who were expecting a beach cottage. Our kids loved the pools and the beach...we ate lunch beachside nearly every day. Went to Ted's a few times for various meals and enjoyed the main restaurant in the hotel a couple of times. Tried to get into the beachside place and the other restaurants onsite, but we didn't book reservations in time. The food was better than decent and did not seem horribly priced, despite what you read from others. We're fairly discriminate when it comes to eating out and there was nothing that we had that would make me inclined to give the place a negative review. We don't do buffets, so can't speak to that, though we did do a buffet that was provided free on New Year's Eve because of a power outage. Considering everything was heated by candles, it wasn't too bad...especially for the price. Another example of the exemplary service. Really the only drawback was the weather. The rains came early this year and it did rain nearly every day, but no day was a total washout and we still received our fair share of sun...certainly enough for a bunch of pale-skinned Minnesotans. We chose Turtle Bay to celebrate our 10th Anniversary and because I had seen Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I read hundreds of these reviews and was a bit leery after reading some of the complainers comments, but I would stay again in a heartbeat...and we will be staying again. We stay at nice places when they are available and did stay a night at a very nice place in Waikiki, but Turtle Bay's location and relaxing vibe put Waikiki to shame.

We reserved a premium ocean front room which was on the 4th floor facing the cove.The room was roomy, clean and had a small balcony. The beach at the cove is great for small children. Given the enormity of the waves in this area, the sheltered beach was perfect for my daughter to play in the water near shore. One of the unique aspects of the TBR is that they use large floodlights to light the waves at night on both sides of the hotel. The only criticism about the room was the intermittent wifi. If you are going to provide wifi, it should work. Otherwise provide wired internet. We ate twice at Ola, twice at Leonardo's, once at Lei lei's,3 times at the poolside bar and twice ordered room service. In my opinion the restaurants and room service at TBR are on the high side of Hawaiian expensive. Ola is a nice, airy restaurant on the beach. As my wife is a vegetarian, the kitchen twice improvised pasta dishes which she enjoyed. I had the (shutome) local swordfish one night and ahi the other. The accompaniment, particulalry the local purple sweet potatoes, made the dishes. Leonardo's appears to be struggling with identity as a new restaurant. Unfortunately, the space doubles by day as the breakfast buffet, so there is little Italian ambiance. As this was my wife's birthday and I had pre-ordered a cake, I was a bit disappointed that the well-intentioned hostess spoiled the suprise by inquiring about the time of presentation with my wife. We shared the caprese-style salad which was good, utilizing local tomatoes. However,the mozzarella was not as fresh as one would prefer. My wife had the penne with a very spicy arrabbiata tomato sauce. I had the fresh ravioli filled with chicken, mushroom and prosciutto which was very rich and tasty. Later in the week, we again shared the caprese and my wife had the eggplant parmegiana which was baked and not quite breaded enough for my wife's taste. I had the steamed clams and the mushroom and fresh tomato pizza, each okay but somewhat lacking in real flavor. On both occasions the wait staff was earnest. On one evening, one of the valets was nice enough to drive us in a cart the relatively short distance from the hotel to the golf course where Lei Lei's is located. For a golf course restaurant, it does tremendous evening business. Many reviewers claim this is the best restaurant for food at TBR. My wife had a vegetarian pasta and I had the ahi sashimi as a starter and the prime rib, both which were quite good. The hotel pools were great. The keiki pool was only 1 1/2 foot deep and my daughter loved being able to stand up no matter where she was. The adult pool was beautiful and the pool area, including the bar, provided tremendous views of the ocean. One thing that distinguishes TBR from most Hawaiian resorts is that when you look down the beach you see beach, not a string of other resorts.

We finished out honeymoon at Turtle Bay after staying 9 days in the Fairmont in Maui. We got hooked w/ how impressive the hotel was portrayed in the moving Forgetting Sarah Marshall (walk in the lobby and you'll quickly feel fooled b/c the movie make it look so much better) and w/ our desire to visit Pearl Harbor we thought this would be a great way to end our honeymoon. We had a cottage room that was 50 feet from the water and the hammock outside was a great touch. Here is where I leave the trip saying I'll never go back ... we pull in and up to the check in - the parking situation was a mess. The valets were not interested in helping and/or directing traffic to keep the area flowing. We get to the front desk and the person did not give us that polished staff impression we had at the Fairmont in Maui. You could tell this was just a job to the person checking us in and not very interested in highlighting the resort. So within the first 15 minutes of pulling into the property we say to each other - I wish I was back at the Fairmont b/c their staff puts this one to shame. Next, I'll talk about their stupid \"resort fee\" - you get free internet (that doesn't work half the time) and park yourself (I guess that means you get no help getting your bags to your room). The beach/pool experience was frustrating, don't even get me started how angry they had us when we arrive at the beach and literally have to fight to get beach chairs - they ran out of chairs!?!? So you have to stand waiting for someone to leave - the kicker was that It wasn't even crowded. Then you have a \"towel card\" that gets you a ONE WHOLE towel for your day at the beach or pool - in contrast the Fairmont has towels rolled up and waiting for you to take whatever you need and don't lose your towel card - yup, they charge you $25 for that if you do. Last, the restaurants were marginal at best. I expect to pay more at a resort, so higher pricing doesn't bother me, but what does is when you pay a higher price and the food just wasn't that good. Average at best food was the theme as we tried every place at the resort.

We all loved the hotel and yes, the extra $25 per night \"Convenience Fee\" was disclosed to me by my travel agent and I agreed to it. We didn't get the room that we booked on our first night and they put us in a one bed room instead with my daugther sleeping on a roll-away bed (she didn't sleep at all because of the springs from her bed). I stated this to the front desk when I checked-out and he credited me one of the $25 charge which is okay. Today I found a $75 extra charge to my credit card and they told me that it is due to the towels/towel cards not returned to them. I told the crediting manager that I returned the towel cards and he reversed the charges. A few minutes later, the hotel manager, Fina called me to apologize and to check if there's anything else....kudos for this! Overall, the hotel is great, housekeeping and staff are awesome and I would go back again and again to the hotel. But just watch out for extra charges that might creep up on your credit card when you come back home. Another thing too is, they offer activities for kids like lei making, ukulele classes and hula classes at no charge (lei making is $5 for materials). Tutu teaches the ukulele and hula, she must be 100 years old but she is the cutest person ever. The kids enjoy her, she's very lively and enthusiastic about what she does.

From the local restaurants and beaches to the overall quiet state of North Shore, this is the best way to enjoy Hawaii. I used to live on Oahu, so I had no need or desire to go to Waikiki. It's great for some and there's much more nightlife, but it's a city and doesn't make me feel like I'm getting away from it all. Most people have the basics covered in the hotel, but here's my tips that I didn't necessarily see in other reviews. Try to get down to the front desk around 5 - 6pm every day and take advantage of the fresh pineapple juice every single day. Snorkeling isn't the best I've ever seen but for most people who've never done it, you'll see a variety of colorful fish that will get you excited. Snorkel in the morning and go farther out in the bay towards the waves to see the best views. Even out there, you can still stand up in some spots. In the room. use the wooden blinds and open the sliding glass door every night. It will still keep the room dark and you can hear the waves all night. Consider getting a waterproof camera even if it's a throwaway. Take pictures going down the slide in the pool. Whether you're young or old, I guarantee you some of those pictures will be your favorites. As for the island itself, I'd encourage you to not eat at the hotel if you have a car. It's not a slight on the food there and I don't say that because I think the food is poor. It may very well be great. It's just that if you're on the island, go take advantage of the local food. We didn't eat on the resort once and I wish we could have stayed longer just to eat at our favorite places over and over again. As for my favorites, you really should do breakfast at either Ted's Bakery up the road or Haleiwa Cafe in Haleiwa. The quesadilla is the best and get it with avocado if you like avocado. The other must is Kahuku Grill. You turn left when you leave the resort and it's tucked away, but look it up. They have one of the best burgers. Now, I'm west coast so I'm obviously partial to In N Out. People have come up to me for years and said this burger or that burger is as good as In N Out and none have come close. Well people, we have a legitimate contender. Get it with avocado and bacon. Well worth it! All these places are just simple places, but it so makes you feel like you actually live there. If you're a stuffy dress up and see the wine list type of person, you may be disappointed. If you like good food at a good price, stay local! And for those of you who've never been, get a few flavors of Hawaiian Sun drinks while you're out. They're all good and no they're not diet, but live a little since you're on vacation. Speaking of which, the infamous shaved ice. You can get it anywhere, but I'd go to Haleiwa to either Matsumoto's or Aoki's. Get the Lilikoi flavor at least once. It's passion fruit. And I'm partial to pineapple. If you like the fruit, you won't be disappointed. Yes, it's touristy, but hey, you're a tourist. And if you have some time, you really should consider the ATV tour at Kualoa ranch. Do the 2 hour tour. It's not cheap, but again, if you spent the money to go to Hawaii, spend a little more and do it. You will not be disappointed. Besides, you'll save all that money by eating local. One last eating suggestion, try to stop by a Cookie Corner. Look it up! Again, I know my opinion is just one of many. However, I hope you try and like at least some of the suggestions. Pass it along if you agree.

After renting a car, it took us about an hour to get there, with a little rushhour traffic in Honululu. It was easy to find, and the staff was all VERY welcoming. It was our anniversary, so they upgraded us from a junior suite to a 2 bedroom suite, and sent up a bottle of champagne. The rooms are somewhat generic, nothing too luxurious, but everything you need, including big bathrooms, refrigerators, guidebooks, nice TVs, etc. The two bedroom suites are actually two adjoining rooms, the first is a standard room, the other is a larger room with a few couches, desk, chaise, dining table, second bathroom, and larger lanai. It was almost too much space for us! Between the beaches and the jungle walking trails, there is a lot of places to walk and get away from the hotel itself, and there are no other hotels or homes for miles. The main beach is nice, not at all crowded or noisy. The surf was a little rough, but it's March. Snorkeling was OK, but nothing special. Quiet rooms, very comfortable beds. Drinks are expensive, $10 mai tais and $5 to $6 beers, but there is a shop where you can get a six pack of local beer for $13 or bud light for $11, along with wine, liquor, snacks, etc. Several dining options, pretty good food but very pricy. I recommend Lei Lei's, on the golf course. Fantastic breakfast and dinner for a little cheaper, just won't have any great ocean views. Several small towns and eateries are within a 10 minute drive, so it makes sense to venture out. Lots of cool surf shops and well marked beaches. I would recommend spending one day off of the resort for exploring, shopping, and other beaches, but there is plenty to do if you stay there. We did not do any of the activities (horseback riding, kayaking, etc), so I can't attest to those, but very happy with the resort in every way.

We were so excited to enjoy our vacation in Hawaii where we stayed for 3 nights in Waikiki and then drove to the North Shore to stay 2 nights at Turtle Bay Resort. When we checked in, the valet staff was friendly and eagerly convinced us to pay extra to valet our car. We then waited in line behind the crew for Cougar Town for 45 minutes. When we got to the check in counter, the staff was overwhelmed and we were treated differently than the LA group. (Having lived in LA for 20 years, I know when I'm being treated differently. We were treated as though we were just some dumb couple on vacation - not people with money.) We got to our room, which was not even at Motel 6 standards. The walls were all scuffed with black marks and poorly touched up with non-matching green paint. The wall outlets were crooked and falling off the walls with unknown (dust?) black/gray fluff coming out of the cracks. The green walls felt like a hospital and the bathroom was dark and dreary. The lighting in the bathroom was falling apart, chipped and dirty. The wood around the window/sliding glass door had chunks missing from it and the room was furnished with only a bed, 2 desk chairs, a small table and an armoire with the TV hidden in it. The space is big, but empty with nothing on the walls, except two square pictures over the bed. Our lanai had one chair, but no space to actually maneuver around the chair to sit in the chair, or stand on the lanai. No plants, no comfort, no anything.

After seeing the chaos, insanity, and NOISE of Waikiki, I never want to be on Waikiki again. (If you love Waikiki and the nightlife, then perhaps the North Shore is not for you). Turtle Bay was the opposite. Quiet in man-made sounds (the ocean will roar!). Not too crowded even when booked completely full. EVERY single staff member polite, cheerful. OK, a couple of the wait staff were missing a few screws or tired and beyond caring, but even they were never rude; the rest had open smiles no matter what. Our son loved the waterslide. I loved the heated pool, with the option for a colder one on warmer days. I was surprised there was a beach appropriate for kids even in winter waves; I'd expected north shore waves to be too violent for a preschooler, but there's a whole protected area next to the hotel with a perfect beach and safe swimming. There were always enough pool-area chairs, without having to wake up at the crack of dawn and stash something on your chair to \"reserve\" it as you do in some places. This, on a day we heard they were fully booked. The heated pool did get busy, but stopped short of being too crowded. Food was not great. It's tough to get really good food on the North Shore, based on my experiences this trip. Haleiwa offered more options, but nothing great. Lei Lei's food was hands-down the best we found anywhere nearby. The bay club was ridiculously bad in every respect. Didn't bother with the other restaurants once we learned that all the hotel food comes from the same mediocre-at-best kitchen, except for Lei Lei. The hotel's regular restaurant apparently can't even cook a hamburger without destroying it (poor innocent piece of Kobe, ruined!). And there's no good grocery store nearby (again, to Haleiwa you must go, which is tough if it's a big wave day and the roads are stopped up), so you're stuck with resort food unless you plan well ahead. Even so, I'd happily spend another week here. My husband and I shared a 2-bed room with our three year old, and the room never felt crowded or small. One note: as seems to be common with hotels everywhere now, those beds advertised as queens were not queen beds. I have a queen at home. That was no queen. Expect to be close to your bedmate. It worked, but barely. Otherwise, the beds were quite comfortable. If I wasn't so eager to open the shades to see what the day looked like outside, and go out on the lanai to enjoy the waves in daylight, I'd have happily slept hours more. We were initially placed in a room in the south wing, second floor, facing the pool. Turns out that is directly above the smoking area outside the lobby. No thank you. Somebody smoked something especially foul our second morning. We were moved to the 6th floor the day after I complained. We packed our suitcases, went out for the afternoon, and came back to pick up new keys and fin our stuff moved to the new room. They were incredibly accommodating. Everyone wants the upper floors, apparently. The bathroom was slightly disappointing; a regular tub and shower. (Water pressure considerably lower on top floor!!). Kind of an icky green color. I was expecting something more. And, as others mention, the tub bottom is higher than the bathroom floor, and this is dangerous to a klutz like me. I managed not to fall by concentrating VERY HARD on not falling every time I got out of the tub. Whew. After the first day, I did not mind the bathroom anymore. It was large and worked fine. The gift shop was a godsend. Snacky foods, hat to replace the one I forgot, drugs, sunscreen, whatever. So glad it was there. So: Rooms good. Bathrooms adequate. Food bad. Giftshop good. Staff good. Pools wonderful. Towel service wonderful. Seating outdoors good. Setting beautiful. Beach good. A final note: I've stayed in a few other resort-type places in my life. Not many -- I'm not so rich -- but a couple. And I've been uncomfortable in them... a pervasive snobby attitude sees to prevail in so many. But here? I was PERFECTLY comfortable. People were just *there* enjoying the ocean and the setting and their drinks and the pool. There didn't see to be that undercurrent of snobby/judging/nastiness you get in some places. Nothing near that vybe. Maybe it's because there were so many families with normal-seeming kids (rather than trust fund babies) here, I don't know, but this is the first kind of resort place I've been able to really relax and enjoy and feel so comfortable. It was well-kept, well-ordered, full of happy but not-too-obnoxious people.

My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View Room that had an incredible, head-on view of the ocean. It was roomy, spacious, and comfortable, with a large king-sized bed and large balcony with seating. We were thrilled. The crashing of the waves is intense and very loud, but soothing. You can hear it even with the sliding glass balcony door and shutters closed. The staff at Turtle Bay is exceptionally friendly, right from the attendant at the front gate to the housekeepers, valets, and waitstaff. Dining at OLA on the beach was a treat, and the Hang Ten poolside cafe was great for lunch. We did a casual dinner at the Bay Club restaurant, and unfortunately they were understaffed that night. Our order got messed up and the waitress was very inattentive, then went out of her way to complain about being really busy. In contrast, however, our waiter at OLA, Connor, was exceedingly attentive, made excellent and helpful suggestions, and took very good care of us. The swimming beach (which is Kulima Cove, I believe) has some of the clearest water I've ever seen, and is great for snorkling. Lots of great fish swimming in the reef that rings the cove. There's enough clear, sandy bottom as well, to make it comfortable to just swim as well. It's very calm and serene. Guests at the hotel get a free hour of snorkling, as well as the use of hotel beach towels and beach chairs. On the other side, in the actual Turtle Bay, the waves are massive and constantly crashing. Didn't see any swimmers out there; it's mostly dominated by surfers catching the big waves. I highly recommend Turtle Bay, even for a night or two. It's worth the experience, and provides the kind of relaxing beauty people come to Hawaii to see.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cTurtle Bay is an absolute thing of beauty.\u201d", "Author": "kenspidey52", "ReviewID": "UR97892316", "Content": "We stayed at the Beach Cottages and it was worth the cost.

I do not understand all the bad reviews of this place, because I could find very little wrong. We ate at the new Italian restaurant Leonardo\u2019s the first night. The food was good but not great, the portions were small and the service was not very good. Our waitress was friendly but she really lacked the skill of properly delivering food and drinks. Our salad was served only minutes from the main course. They are just starting out so I will cut them a break, but I did expect better. We ate at the breakfast buffet the first morning and it was great. We decided to have it every morning of our stay. Everything was fresh. The fruit especially the pineapple was exceptional and the pastries were wonderful. This is the best buffet breakfast I have ever had and I have had a lot. The second night we ate at Olla\u2019s. Very good food, average service and rather expensive. The location can\u2019t be beat though and I think If I ever return I will do lunch here. The third night we ate at Lei Leis which we killed very much. Great service and food plus friendly people.

We rented a cottage and if you can splurge I'd say they are the best way to go. The scenery right outside your sliding glass door is truly breathtaking and the sound of the crashing waves is mesmerizing. The service in the cottages was superb. Complimentary Turtle Bay T-shirts and fresh fruit upon arrival....not to mention the turn down service with chocolate covered macadamia nuts nightly. Our ice bucket was always full and no request seemed to small. I found the rooms to be clean and I'm fairly picky about that. The floors are all wood and I looked behind and under the bed and there were no dust bunnies to be found. The bathrooms were huge and well appointed with the most fragrant line of lotion, bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner. As for activities there is plenty to do. My husband played golf and did enjoy himself. He did recommend playing the harder course (there are two) as the one he played wasn't the most challenging. I did visit the spa for the lomi lomi facial and massage, both were heavenly and I would highly recommend. We took the helicopter tour (located on property) and it was also something I would recommend. We flew all the way to Honolulu and got an aerial view of Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, and most of the North Shore. I hate flying normally but the ride was so smooth and picturesque, you really don't feel nervous. We also took a horseback ride that went back and forth between a tropical rain forest setting and the beachfront. We went in a small group of 4 which was nice and it was really leisurely so you really got to take in the view. We watched people take surfing lessons there on the property and I was really impressed with that as well. The instructor had a family of four surfing (mom, dad, and two boys) well within 45 minutes, and it was fun to see how good and encouraging the instructors were. The hotel also offered glass bottom kayaking but we never saw those out on the water. We ate at most every restaurant (with the exception of 21) and my husband and I both commented that it was typical resort food for the most part. Not horrible, but nothing remarkable and a little pricey. My breakfast recommendation would actually be to drive 10 minutes to Ted's Bakery in Sunset Beach, as they offered huge portions, good prices, and a nice variety of fresh bakery goods, omelettes, etc. There are also a couple places in Haleiwa, but that's a good 20 minutes away. For lunch there are also the shrimp trucks, which are pretty close to the property. Drinks at Turtle Bay were good, but also a little pricey...$10 for a pina colada at the pool bar. So to summarize I will say that the property is absolutely beautiful, a vacation we will remember forever. I would recommend it over staying in Waikiki without hesitation. After living in Hawaii for many years the North Shore gives you the true feeling of Hawaii. It remains unspoiled and there are so many countless beaches that aren't overcrowded and commercialized. It is truly a special place and we will definitely stay there again. The hotel concierge also took care of booking whatever we wanted off property as well. They got us booked for our luau at the Polynesian Cultural (just about 10 minutes away), and helped us with everything we needed to know to for our day trip to Pearl Harbor.

But because we threw this trip together last minute based on an unusually cheap airfare, the place that we've rented before in Lanikai was not available, which is how we wound up here. For a big resort -- I think there's over 400 rooms -- there are plenty of places to get away. When you check in, the map on the back shows various hiking trails, many of them along the beach and pretty much each morning, we took one of the hikes, which was a great way to start the day. We thought about springing for a cottage, but in the end wound up in the main hotel with a nice view of the ocean. Each night, we opened the sliding glass door to the small terrace and closed the shutters and fell asleep to the sound of the waves, which made for great sleeping. And the hammocks by the cottages are a great way to spend a few hours. And they're not just for people staying in the cottages. We ate at Ola's (twice), the Italian place, and did breakfast every day because it was free since we booked a seven-night package. They also threw in free tickets to the Polynesian Cultural Center and gave us a free night, so between the $50 in breakfast, the $200 in PCC tickets and the free night, it was a pretty good deal. Here's what we didn't like: the hotel only recently went non-smoking -- like Jan. 1 of this year -- and at first, they put us in one of the former smoking rooms. But it takes a lot longer than 40 days to rid a room of stale smoke. Luckily, the front desk manager agreed to move us to another room the next day. We also thought the spa services were way over-priced at $135 for a 50 minute massage and $65 for a pedicure. And the classes, which are not part of the $25 resort fee, are spotty. A Pilates class by Marissa was great, but the yoga class taught by some dude was one of the worst I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of yoga. I'd also add that while they bill this as a honeymoon spot, there's a lot of kids here and a lot of poorly behaved kids. (There's also a lot of poorly behaved adults too, which kind of surprised us, given that this isn't some cheap place on Waikiki). One night at the Italian restaurant, there was a little girl running around the tables and shrieking at the top of her lungs while the parents blithely sipped red wine. And the last night we were there, a young girl was in the next room and because the rooms have those inter-connecting doors, we could hear her screaming at 5 am. Would we come back?

The other outstanding part about this hotel was the amazing view from our beach cottage. It truly spoiled us. Every night we had amazing sunset views while lounging in our room. We kept ordering room service as the view was the best in the hotel. Only minor issue was the service at 21 Degrees North.

Perhaps my perception of the resort is biased by my over-optimistic expectations and the fact that it rained heavily for the 2 days of our stay, but some things are bad in any weather. On arrival it took us over half hour to get checked in even if we were only 3rd in the queue. When our turn came the guy at the desk typed the equivalent of War and Peace in the computer although he only asked my husband for our names and our home address. When giving us directions to our room he spoke really quickly and with a very heavy accent so we didn't really understand even after asking him to repeat twice. This meant that we either had to guess were we were going or get someone to take us there. We decided to ask at the valet parking desk and thankfully someone came over with a buggy and took us to our bungalow. As many others have commented, the rooms are very dated but I suppose some find this charming. Although not the most up-to-date room, the bungalow was clean, comfortable and spacious and it had a lovely see view from the veranda. On arrival the radio was on with very relaxing/romantic music, which was a very nice touch. The only problem was the door to the veranda which came off altogether when we opened it to have a look outsite. We managed to put it back together somehow so didn't bother to call maintenance. The next day when we came back from our day out we found that the door had been fixed. Obviously the maid had noticed and got it sorted, which again was great. The resort itself was beautiful even in the rain, so I guess it must be stunning in nice sunshine. The beach looked a bit small even when nobody was there so I wonderer if it would get really crowded in nice weather when the hotel is full. The location is great for surfing and for trips to parts of Oahu which are more 'native'.

That's not to say we did not find any staff members who were courteous and helpful (Damien at Ola was exceptional), but it's hit or miss from there. We stayed two nights in a beach cottage to celebrate our 20th anniversary. The setting is gorgeous as was the view of water, a mere 30 feet from our deck. We could clearly hear the surf with sliding doors open; when closed the room was pleasantly quiet despite the presence of young kids on either side of our unit. (note to honeymooners: this is a popular family spot and boisterous children abound.) Beds were comfortable, spacious bath w/ Japanese soaking tub, lighting on dimmers, bathrobes & slippers and bath accoutrements met expectations for a $500/night room. However, the room shows wear and the furnishings were uncomfortable, especially on the deck where chairs and bench lacked chaise pads. The property needs another pool, as the pool area was over crowded, hot tub included. The daily fresh fruit and ice was delivered as promised, and the turn-down service with chocolate-covered macadamia nuts one night and palm leaf-wrapped coconut macaroons the second night were a nice touch. The manager also sent a complimentary bottle of champagne our first night with a note promising personal service for cottage guests, noting a special concierge extension. The bartender called to confirm our drink order w/ lunch before room service delivered, a mark of a professional and great service. So while the planning is obviously there to help create a special experience, and sometimes succeeded, other aspects and staff members ruined the mood. The maid did not remove room service platters when our room was \"cleaned,\" inviting fruit flies to congregate by evening. Our tissue box was empty and also not replenished. At checkin, we were early and, so, left our bags with the valet. The front desk said they would call when our room was ready (an unmet promise), while we happily went out to enjoy the spectacular surf hitting the Bonzai Pipeline. When we returned after 3 pm to check in, we pulled up to the front to collect our bags and room key. My husband first stopped by valet to leave our car key, in case the car got in the way during the ensuing 5-10 minutes we expected to be there. Rather than welcome us and thank us for the gesture, the valet curtly said there was no parking at the entrance and said they'd move the car if we took longer than 15 mins. Checkin was perfunctory, adequate, but not exactly welcoming. We were given a map, but later discovered our unit location was not marked. We'd emailed the concierge in advance of our trip for reservations at Ola, and discovered they had not been made. So we asked the concierge again for help when we first dropped off our bags and discovered when we came back to check in, they still hadn't been made.

Later that night we ordered extra pillows as the ones we had were very clumpy. It took well over an hour to get new pillows. After all the service issues and poor room we decided to check out a day early. The front desk was very sympathetic when hearing my dilemma and agreed to let me check out without penalty a day early. However, no other gesture was made. Later in the day another manager called my cell after hearing about my issues. He also was very sympathetic but made no gesture to me.

Unfortunately, for a family with a 2-year old, there was little we could do. Children must be 3-years old for the horseback riding. The bike/scooter rentals did not have child-safe seats or attachments. The keiki turtle club also had an min. age. The walking paths were not \"stroller friendly\". The only activity we could truly enjoy with our toddler was the beach. Although the beach on-site was small, it was relaxing. Umbrellas and chairs were always available. The towel exchange was convenient. The equipment rental center had sand toys that we used free of charge. Our best days were spent on this beach! Snorkeling was also fun, especially with the free rental that came with the room. ROOMS The rooms were old, as others have commented on. I didn't mind the older furniture. The thing that bothered me most was the carpet. It was very sticky-feeling and our feet were always black after walking on it without shoes. The dust balls along the edges of the carpet were also bothersome. I dropped a cotton hat near the corner of the room and it was filthy when I picked it up. A regular carpet cleaning would make a big difference! All of the rooms have great views, but there is a difference that I wasn't aware of beforehand. Standard rooms (no balcony) are located on the lower floors. They have more obstructions and views of the conference/restaurant rooftops. This is also why a higher floor is better,...less roof view. Rooms with a small balcony face the sunrise and the beach. Rooms with a large balcony face the sunset, which is probably the better of the two. There is one smoking floor (5th floor) on one of the wings. If you are sensitive to this, be sure to ask for a room in one of the other wings. We originally had a great 6th floor room,..until we realized that we could smell cigarette smoke all the time from the floor below us and therefore couldn't leave our balcony door open. They were very good about allowing us to change rooms. DINING All of the food at the resort was VERY expensive. Our first night there, we were tired and decided to order room service. We ordered a pizza, fries, and 3 drinks,..the total was almost $60! And the pizza was not very good. The Palm Terrace breakfast buffet was expensive, but worth it for the variety of food and fruits! Ola, the restaurant on the beach, had a wonderful and relaxing view, but again was very expensive. My $10 salad which was supposed to have chicken and mandarin oranges had only one piece of each and was basically all greens. Expect to spend a lot of money if dining on site! Tricks for getting better food at a lower cost: 1. Shrimp Stands - take a left out of the resort and you'll find several shrimp stands and trucks. 2. Fruit Stands - Take a right out of the resort and fruit stands are located right along that road. Buy some and store it in the fridge in the hotel room! 3. Ted's bakery - turn right out of hte resort and it's about 10/mins minute down the road on the left. Great breakfast foods (including hot dishes). Their lunch and dinner meals are only okay. 4. Haleiwa - There are wonderful restaurants in this town. It's a 30-minute drive, but well worth it. The Grass Skirt Grill and Bonzai Sushi Bar were great! VISITING ATTRACTIONS The resort is fairly close to Haleiwa, the Polynesian center, Kualoa ranch, and Waimea falls, but is a really long drive to everything else. I would recommend only staying at the resort for a few days unless you plan on using all of the local amenities (helicopter ride, horseback riding, scooter rental, surfing, etc.). Outside of the resort, you definitely need a car. Fortunately, you can rent from a place located right in the lobby of the hotel.

We were overall very impressed with this resort...we tried to go in with an open mind given some negative reviews, but have since concluded that 'you can't please everyone'. The location is stunning...not only are you mere steps away from the north shore, the rooms have gorgeous views. As pointed out in other reviews, they are not all unobstructed and you may have a portion of a roof visible in your view...it is your choice whether you choose to focus on the roof or the beautiful Pacific beyond it! The surf is so fierce that you could hear it roaring all night long...I miss that sound! That being said, the location that makes it also breaks it...yes, you are aways away from the nearby towns and at least 1 hour away from Honolulu/Waikiki which can be frustrating if you end up with rainy days like we did! But we still enjoyed the scenic drive to the other side of the island. Also, the nearby towns aren't nearly as far as we expected...you can find a grocery/convenience store (but no major shopping!) within less than 10 minutes drive. The service was immaculate...every single staff member that passed us in the hallway greeted us and wished us a good day. Such friendly staff! The resort is also immaculate, very clean. It appears as if they are slowly but surely updating it...rooms feature super comfortable beds (my understanding is they were newly replaced) and flat screen tv's and simple decor/colours making it appear modern. They still need some work, like the baseboards have seen better days, but it's not the \"dilapidated, rundown resort\" some reviewers claim it is. The bathrooms are huge and include a mini fridge. The balconies are a very good size (depending on which room category you book). I will review the restaurants separately but the one thing I will say is that this is the one area I was remotely close to being disappointed as I was not impressed with the selection for daytime lunches/snacks. It would be nice if there was a place where you could go grab a quick sandwich/snack, but it does not exist. A soup and salad would have cost me $19! On that note, I do feel the resort does \"nickel and dime\" you a bit...that resort fee really needs to be amended. We knew it was there and it is what it is, but charging $25 per day for such items as wi-fi or coffee in your room seems a bit absurd given that no other hotel I've ever stayed at has charged for these items! In my opinion, those items should be included in the room rate...even if that means upping it by $25 per night. Drinks are $10...again, a little excessive in my opinion, but it was also expected. The pool is great and not too crowded and the crowd seemed to be a good mix, mostly young families and young couples from what I noticed. The resort appeared virtually deserted after dark.

In an attempt to remedy our frustration we were offered the presidential suite, but we asked to see it first, before making a decision. At 3.45PM the room was not ready (neither the cottage, nor the suite), which is unacceptable when you pay over $500/night (at worst the room should have been ready at 3PM, in most good hotels it would have been ready earlier). Finally, when we were given the key to the suite, we were also told that they have given the cottage (on the assumption that we'll take the suite!) to somebody else! We were very frustrated and upset because the whole point of going to Turtle Bay was to stay in front of the ocean, not in the 5th floor of a hotel!

At a resort of this size you would expect a separate kids and adult pool. And the chairs! They had these old, cheap, plastic chairs, without a cushion, fit for Comfort Inn, not a five star resort! And of course, they didn't set up the chairs for you (with towels) and gave you one towel per person. We enjoyed the long walks on the beach, especially the beach fronting the cottage, but again were frustrated to discover they only had 2 or 3 hammocks for 30 plus cottages- obviously they were always occupied! We dined at 21 north, good food, but nothing special. Ola menu seemed rather basic and the restaurant looked unpolished (we dined at much nicer looking beach restaurants), so we skipped it. Instead, we had a wonderful dinner at Bonzai Sushi in Haleiwa and a nice casual lunch at the shrimp trucks, in the proximity of the hotel. Overall, we came expecting Hana Maui service and quality in an otherwise similarly beautiful location and were dissapointed to discover the hotel lacks class and does not pay attention to service/discriminating customers. The lack of attention to detail spoiled the overall experience, e,g, pool scene, lobby and reception (no lei upon arrival, refreshing drinks or cold towels), poor service, room not ready on time, etc. We would definitely return to North Shore and hope that either the management makes some changes (the hotel really needs an upgrade to be called 5 star) or that some stylish, intimate hotel opens in between!", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Diamond Bar, California", "Title": "\u201cBad place to stay in Hawaii\u201d", "Author": "Bella5816185", "ReviewID": "UR88403594", "Content": "I booked this hotel for 5 nights after 3 nights stay at Royal Hawaiian and thought to enjoy the relaxing days away from the busy Waikiki.

Looking at their website and reading reviews, I thought this would be a smooth planning process...I was mistaken. You would think that a venue that did hundreds of weddings a year would know how to respond to emails and requests. I had to email several times, leave at least a couple voicemails and finally leave a very stern voicemail in order for them to respond. This happened on multiple occasions. I ended up having to call the management company in Texas to get responses on a few things that were holding up my clients from sending out their invitations. Only after I filed a complaint with the management company, did the general manager of the resort step in to help. The resort is unionized, so i think the employees feel no need to do a good job. They have all sorts of hidden charges (they charge 1/2 of the site fee to have a rehearsal, plus extra if you want the event coordinator there). There was garbage and cigarette butts at the ceremony site (right in the aisle) and when i asked the event manager to have it cleaned up, she said the crew was not there on saturdays and there was nothing she could do, i asked for a rake at least, she never got one to me...My helpers ended up on their hands and knees picking up the garbage so the bride could walk down a clean aisle. During the cocktail hour, we were supposed to have passed hors d'oeuvres (we were paying for 2 waiters to pass them out at $65/hour), but the hors d'oeuvres ended up on a bussing tray on the side of the lawn. The Event Coordinator that was assigned to the wedding did pretty much nothing. In the end they tried to charge us for some indoor audio setup, when we were outdoors the entire time.

The North Shore is simply stunning and worlds away from the hubbub of Waikiki. Our travel was arranged through AAA and based on reviews here, we chose to stay in a cabin. We never did see the hotel rooms (we had planned to check them out for comparison but the cabins were so terrific, we never got around to it). We requested a king but recvd 2 queens upon check-in. A king was available starting 2nd night so they moved us. They offered $25 off (one night\u2019s resort fee) for our troubles and by asking for more, I rec\u2019d a total of $50 off. In our room, we found tshirts and fruit, along with a note from our concierge (who we never did meet -- apparently the cabins have their own concierge; when we needed something we just hit 0 so I'm guessing we used the main hotel's concierge). The first cabin was #124. That set of cabins is set back (probably the furthest back of any set) from the ocean. A large swath of lawn separated the ocean and the rooms. The view was still nice (and many hammocks in the area) but it wasn\u2019t the view we wanted. Since we were moving anyway, I had my husband scope out rooms with a better view and put in a request if a room closer to the ocean was available. Our second room had a spectacular view (my husband won\u2019t let me post the number, sorry), just steps from the ocean. But all of the rooms offer wonderful views and it is heavenly sleeping with the doors open and the sound of the surf crashing so near. The cottages aren\u2019t exactly cottages; they are single-floor rows of 6 rooms, separated in the middle by a storage room. Despite having neighbors, our lanai felt completely private, during the day and evening. It was great having a large lanai as we were able to use it during our daughter's naps and after we'd put her to bed. The cottage rooms were fabulous. Spacious, clean, a separate bath and shower. We had our 4 yr old with us and there was more than enough space for all (she slept with us so no rollaway). The room with 2 queens felt spacious and lovely. Had it not been for the view, we wouldn\u2019t have minded staying there. The king room had a wet bar area that the queen didn\u2019t have and in the bathroom, the toilet had a door (not found in the room with 2 queens). I'm picky about mattresses and found both rooms to have nice mattresses and had no problem sleeping. There is a $25 resort fee. While not onerous, I found it irritating. It covers things like internet, the newspaper, self parking (in the city perhaps but parking is self-parking is abundant at Turtle Bay, it was ridiculous they listed it) and a few other things that we didn\u2019t use or want (like an hour volleyball rental). I\u2019d much rather them raise the room cost by $25 per night and skip the resort fee all together. At a nice resort, a fee like that makes you feel like they are nickel and diming you. The towel card didn\u2019t help that feeling. You are issued 1 towel card per person and must present the card to receive a towel at the pool. At the end of your stay, if you don\u2019t return the right number of towels/cards, you are charged. I realize that there are people that steal towels but really? Maybe it\u2019s because I wouldn\u2019t dream of stealing but having to keep track of a towel card was just silly to me and one more thing I didn\u2019t want to deal with on my vacation. I don't think I've ever stayed at a resort before that had a towel card. I rated cleanliness only a 4 because the rooms next door to us must have ordered room service -- and the dishes sat outside their doors for at least a day in one case and two days in the other. Our room, itself, was perfectly clean but it seemed a bit icky that used dishes would be left outside for so long. We went to 3 of the 5 restaurants \u2013 missed 21 Degrees North because it isn\u2019t open Sundays or Mondays and we planned poorly and we skipped the Bay Club entirely because it\u2019s more a bar than a restaurant, not on the beach and we had our 4 year old. For variety, we did venture offsite to Romy\u2019s, Giovani\u2019s, Kahuku Grill, Ted\u2019s Bakery. I\u2019ll review the restaurants separately except for Lei Lei\u2019s as we only went once for breakfast (3 options on the menu, we had the breakfast croissants & French toast \u2013 a good option for something different. Pretty sure the cheese on the croissants was Kraft Singles. The coffee, like at Palm Terrace, is weak). If you require coffee stronger than water, hit the cart in the lobby. The resort offers plenty to do (horses, surf lessons, tennis, etc) but we stuck mostly to the pool and walks along the beach. My husband did take a surf lesson; the waves were a bit rocky so they went offsite about 10 minutes. He came back bruised and battered as the waves were still quite rough 10 minutes away but he had a great time and wants to do it again. The waves are a bit rough for playing in the ocean (remember, we have a 4 year old) so the pool with it\u2019s beachside bar/restaurant, Hang Ten, was our preference. Our daughter loved the waterslide and there's a waterfall in the same pool. Pool rules say no floating devices but nearly every young child we encountered had them and on the second day of our stay, we brought out the floaties for our 4 yr old and no one said a thing. One thing about security \u2013 You can lock the screen doors to the beach but I found that moving the screens a bit and / or the sliding glass doors, allowed more than enough space to slip through the door. I discovered it after I returned from the spa and my husband had locked the screen for a walk \u2013 I didn\u2019t realize he was out of the room and went to the ocean side, and slipped right in. A simple dowel or stick of the right size placed on the glass door side of the track would fix this problem. I mentioned it to management before we left so they could fix it. It\u2019s not critical as you can shut the glass doors for security but it\u2019s something to be aware of so you don\u2019t leave thinking your room is secure and come back to find something of value taken. We were lucky, my husband left his wallet sitting by my computer and camera equipment and nothing was taken but our story could easily be different. They were filming a reality tv show at the resort while we were there. That was unfortunate as there were certain areas off limits -- including a stunning beach on the property that we were hoping to see. The staff, everyone from the maintenance people to the cleaning people to the bartenders, at Turtle Bay was phenomenal -- friendly and professional. Every encounter we had with the staff was a pleasure. The North Shore is so relaxing and Turtle Bay maintains that feel.

Well, we watched the adult comedy \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" last night, which was largely filmed at Turtle Bay Resort, and enough great memories came rushing back that I thought i should revisit the experience. Checked in early and went to our room. The room overlooked the pool, the inner beach by the condos, and the north shore radar site that first spotted, and ignored, the radar returns from the attacking Japanese aircraft in 1941. The view was mostly inland. My wife was not impressed, so we returned to the front desk and politely asked for a room with more of an ocean view. We said that we would wait for however long it took, so we sashayed down by the pool and killed a few hours swilling Mai-Tais and chilling. After a few hours, we were called and were shown to our very nice ocean view room overlooking the wedding reception area. It was stunning and incredibly romantic. My wife even misted up a bit because it was \"so perfect.\" I must have slipped the receptionist a tip earlier, because a few hours later a nice young lady brought up a chilled bottle of champagne for us to enjoy on our patio. The resort fee includes snorkeling, so we grabbed masks and fins and hit the little bay every day. It was, by snorkeling standards, a bit lackluster, but it was just fine with me, since my attention span is only good for about an hour of flailing in the bay anyhow. The bay by the pool had about four large sea turtles flopping in the tide, which attracted quite a crowd on the shore, watching with pleasure. We ate at the restaurant on the beach once. The food was pricey, but OK,. We had a couple of friends visit for dinner, and the girl of the couple said it was the most romantic dinner she had ever had.

Primarily two reasons: 1) While in Waikiki for spring break in 2009 we rented a car and took a day trip to the North Shore. We did some shopping and ate lunch in Haleiwa, and had an excellent snorkel session at Shark\u2019s Cove. 2) The movie \u2018Forgetting Sarah Marshall\u2019 really made the hotel look good. How did we plan the trip? Through Costco Travel I got a package that included 7 nights in an ocean front cottage (including hotel tax but not resort fee), 7 days of breakfast buffet for all of us (including tax and tip), and 7 days of a convertible from Alamo (including tax) for about $542 per day. I consider this a good deal and have always had good service from Costco Travel. Arrival \u2013 It was probably close to 1:00 p.m. when we turned left off Kamehameha Highway into Turtle Bay. It would be an understatement to say that we were excited as we drove up the drive toward the resort. We stopped at the parking guard house and were very pleased to see that a pre-printed parking card was waiting for us. The parking attendant was full of the aloha spirit and made us feel very welcome. We then pulled into the front of the hotel so that we could check-in and were quickly greeted by a valet. He had no problem with us leaving our car in front while we checked in. We had a very short wait at the front desk and then were quickly and courteously checked in, including receiving our breakfast buffet vouchers, towel cards (including an extra one \u2026 just ask nicely!), and leis. We were asked if we wanted to use valet parking or self-park \u2013 we decided to self-park because there is a small lot dedicated to the cottages. By the time we had driven the couple hundred feet from the lobby to the cottage parking lot the concierge for the cottages rolled up next to us in a golf cart and immediately took care of our luggage. She was super nice and really made us feel welcome. We were so excited as we walked up to cottage 116, and were blown away when we opened the front door and saw exactly how close the cottage is to the ocean. The concierge brought in our luggage, left for a few minutes, and then quickly returned with cold drinks, bottled water, ice, fruit, and Turtle Bay t-shirts for all of us (she had asked our shirt size before she left the first time). She then proceeded to answer all of our questions and give us all kinds of information about the resort. Once the concierge left we quickly unpacked and knew that we had picked a great place for a vacation. Staff \u2013 You\u2019ll notice that in my description of the arrival I have called out the great attitude of the four employees we encountered. This attitude extended across the board to all employees at the hotel, including pool servers, beach shack rental, beach boys, towel girls at the pool, hostesses and waiters/waitresses at Ola\u2019s and Lei Lei\u2019s and Palm Terrace restaurants, hotel concierge, business center concierge, maids, turn-down service, tennis shop, Kohala Bay shop, Lamont\u2019s \u2013 all of them were incredibly nice. We found ourselves commenting over and over about how friendly all of the staff are at this hotel. The aloha spirit lives at Turtle Bay. When I read previous Trip Advisor posts about rude staff I just can\u2019t fathom how that is possible. We certainly encountered nothing but great service, and I felt so strongly about this that at check-out I asked the front desk person to get the manager on duty so that I could relay the positive feedback. Resort Fee - $25 per day is charged to your account and covers all of the following: local calls, no-fee access to 800 numbers & credit card calls, wireless internet, in-room coffee and tea (while the coffee isn\u2019t 100% Kona it is from Hawaii; my wife said it was pretty good), daily newspaper (Honolulu paper, and I was also brought the New York Time on Sunday because I asked for it), self-parking, rental for one-hour per day for two people of a snorkel set or boogie board or volleyball (we bring our own snorkel equipment so my daughter took the boogie board for two hours each day), access to the fitness center, one hour of tennis court time per room per day, in-room safe, incoming faxes, and use of the business center (Internet access, print boarding passes, etc.). I\u2019m not a fan of resort fees but I must say that we got our money\u2019s worth on this one, and I recommend that you do the same. We rented the boogie board each day; we played tennis every morning; I use the fitness center a couple of times; my wife drank the in-room coffee; I love reading the newspaper (and the Honolulu paper is pretty good); we always use the safe; I used the business center a couple of times to get directions and print boarding pass. Cottage (location and exterior/front) \u2013 Simply put \u2026 you need to do the cottage rather than the hotel room if you can afford it. The cottages are a fantastic experience. There are 42 of them grouped in seven buildings of six side-by-side cottages. Within a group of six there are two clusters of three, which allows for connecting doors. From the outside (front door) the cottages aren\u2019t anything special \u2013 they are far enough away from the rest of the resort to assure some privacy but close enough to everything so that you aren\u2019t too far away. For example, from our front door to the tennis court took about 90 seconds; from our front door to the pool took about two minutes. We were in cottage 116, which was close to a perfect location. My definition of \u201cperfect location\u201d means the patio is the closest to the beach and the view from the patio is unobstructed by any foliage. With that as my definition I would choose 114 on my next visit, with 115 and 113 being my next choices. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 116 was excellent but the other three would be just a bit better. One quick comment about the non-cottage rooms. The hotel rooms facing east/north-east have extremely small balconies that are only large enough to hold two small chairs. In fact, the first floor room (floor two of the hotel?) have no balcony. The rooms facing north and the rooms facing west/north-west have larger balconies that appear to be much more conducive to sitting. If you want to watch the sun rise then go with east/north-east, if you want to watch the sun set (and have a bigger balcony) then go with west/north-west. But if you can afford it and you don\u2019t need a suite-sized room just do a cottage. Cottage (bathroom) \u2013 The bathroom is immediately on the left as you walk in. It has a large tub and a large stand-alone shower with a glass door. The floor and counter appear to be marble \u2013 the counter is large as is the mirror above it. Unfortunately, the counter has only one sink. The coffee pot sits on the counter along with the coffee/tea/etc. The toilet sits next to the counter against the cottage exterior wall. Both the hot water and water pressure are fine. Also on the counter are the amenities, including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion. We liked everything but the lotion (I liked the lotion but my wife and daughter did not). There is also soap, cotton balls, q-tips, and a sewing kit. Cottage (interior) \u2013 The interior is larger than a standard hotel room. The depth is probably at least twice the width. Your attention is immediately drawn through the room to the view of the ocean out the patio. There are appear to be two different sizes of cottages and ours was the smaller of the two. The difference in size is in the width of the room. Just past the bathroom the room opens up and has a very high vaulted ceiling of at least 15 feet. There is a well-functioning ceiling fan with a wall control (multi-speed) on the wall next to the thermostat. The thermostat functions well and the a/c is very good but could be a bit quieter. The closet is small and contained two robes and two pairs of slippers. We could have used a few more hangars but it was not worth a call to housekeeping. The safe is also in the closet \u2013 we used it all the time and it functioned perfectly. Our room had two queen beds, which I found to be very comfortable. There were plenty of pillows and blankets. In between the beds was a nightstand with two lights (one for each bed). Opposite the beds was an old school armoire with drawers. The TV sits inside the armoire \u2013 it is a flat panel plasma of ~32\u201d. The picture quality was good and the selection of channels was good, too. I don\u2019t watch much TV when I am in Hawaii. There were several drawers in the armoire, which provided plenty of space for our clothes. On either side of the armoire were large benches, which were great for sitting or placing items. Next to the bed was a rack capable of supporting a large suitcase. The main sleeping area was set off from a sitting area and the patio by wooden railings, which are great for drying wet clothes. You step down two steps to get to the sitting area, which contains a mini bar, small refrigerator, desk, two chairs, couch, coffee table, and lamp. The refrigerator worked very well and we stocked it full of water that we purchased at the Foodland in Pupukea. There was plenty of room for all of us and our stuff without feeling as if we were crowding each other. I found the room to be very dark at night and very quiet. The furniture was in pretty good shape but with obvious nicks and cuts and scrapes that come from extensive use. Cottage (patio) \u2013 A large sliding glass door with a screen door leads to a large covered patio. On the patio is a table, two chairs, and a rocking chair. There is also a nice ledge on which to prop your feet and /or place items to dry. The patio was a bit dirty and the furniture is showing its age, but that is what I expect given the proximity to the ocean. The patio is lit but when the light is on at night it tends to attract bugs. You are in the tropics \u2013 you will see bugs, including bugs that you may have never seen before. You will also see lizards, and feral cats, and chickens, and other critters. Get used to it and don\u2019t complain about it as this is part of Hawaii. Grounds \u2013 Just past the patio is a small garden, then a few feet of grass, and then the beach. Immediately in front of our cottage it was too rocky to get to the beach but about ten feet to the left some stairs had been carved into the rock making it simple to get to the beach. Be warned that the beach in front of the cottages is quite rocky. You can swim there \u2013 many people did \u2013 but you need to be more careful than you would in the cove. I liked the landscaping but I think there was just a bit too much grass. There is a lot of volcanic rock in the area and it works really well with the landscaping. There are many varieties of trees, which may not be in keeping with peoples\u2019 image of Hawaii. Again, this is real Hawaii \u2013 it\u2019s not all palm trees. Trust me \u2013 it looks great. There are plumeria trees all over the place and may daughter & I would collect the newly fallen blooms and cover our patio table, which really made our patio smell great. We replaced the blooms every two days to keep things fresh. Grass is not easy to grow on Hawaii \u2013 it will appear uneven, you\u2019ll see some dead spots and even some weeds. Again, this is Hawaii. The overall look of the landscaping is extremely good. I saw landscapers working every day trimming bushes, mowing, edging, pruning trees, etc. The landscaping is well taken care of. Make sure that you checkout the blowhole near the Hang Ten pool bar \u2013 very cool! Cottage (cleanliness) \u2013 The maid service was great; typically a crew of two gave the room a thorough cleaning every day including damp mopping the hard wood floors. We found them to be very prompt, courteous, and friendly. The turn-down service was also very good. Each night they would leave chocolate covered mac nuts and, sometimes, macaroons (which my wife and daughter said were delicious). Late every morning the cottage concierge would stop by with some fruit (apples, plums, oranges, bananas, etc.) and a fresh bucket of ice. Dining \u2013 We ate breakfast every morning at Palm Terrace. The service was always efficient and friendly, the food was good and plentiful. My wife, who really knows salsa, pronounced the cook\u2019s salsa to be exceptionally good. She spent some time speaking with him and got the recipe. This salsa was on her eggs every morning. We had two dinners at the golf course restaurant \u2013 Lei Lei\u2019s \u2013 and enjoyed both meals and the service (although they need to fix the broken tiki torches). This restaurant is very popular with the locals. We had one dinner at Ola\u2019s (our last night) and really enjoyed it (I\u2019m sounding like a broken record, aren\u2019t I?). The service and food were very good, although my king crab could have been a bit warmer. Both restaurants have a keiki menu with plenty of choices for even a picky child. We also ordered drinks from the bar at Ola\u2019s twice \u2013 once during the day at the beach and once in the evening around sunset. Both times the service was fast and friendly. Tennis \u2013 The tennis complex seems to be deemphasized at the resort. There used to be ten courts but it looks as if six of them are being left untended and will eventually be torn out. This is too bad as I\u2019m guessing that there aren\u2019t many good places to play tennis on the North Shore. Locals are allowed to have a tennis membership at Turtle Bay. We played tennis every morning and the four courts that are being kept up are in great condition. The tennis staff is very nice and helpful. Golf \u2013 I didn\u2019t golf but a lot of people were golfing, and there was an amateur tournament going on while were there. I bought a hat at the pro shop and received, of course, excellent service. The golf courses do not hug the ocean so don\u2019t go expecting a Pebble Beach experience. Horses \u2013 We didn\u2019t ride but we checked out the horses \u2013 there are a lot of them. Trails \u2013 Our first full day we took a long walk west on the beach past the bunker to a very secluded cove. It was a beautiful beach; unfortunately, the water was a bit murky so we didn\u2019t swim there. We walked back through the forest trail. I highly recommend these trails but be warned that to walk the beach trail you must have reef shoes and you must be prepared for a strenuous workout. On another day we walked east on the beach \u2013 absolutely beautiful but it is very hard to walk on that sand. The benefit is that there are no crowds. Cove \u2013 The cove is cool \u2026 water temp was at least 78 \u2026 small, unintimidating waves \u2026 mostly sandy bottom. I wish the water were clearer, but when I did snorkel I did see some nice fish. It is a fun place to spend the afternoon, especially with small children. The beach boys will happily set you up with chairs, towels, and an umbrella. There may be times when they are out of chairs and umbrellas but if you are patient they will set you up as soon as stuff is returned. The woman who runs the beach toys shack is extremely nice. By day three she knew our names and had a boogie board ready for my daughter. Beaches \u2013 The beaches are absolutely gorgeous; my words couldn\u2019t possibly do justice so I\u2019m not even going to try. Pool \u2013 I was very pleased with the pool area for many reasons: 1) Towel girls are very friendly; 2) Food/drink service is friendly and plentiful; on a weekday (and this is mid-October) there were always at least four girls serving and at least two bartenders; 3) The Jacuzzis are perfectly positioned to watch the sunset, and they are hot; 4) The keiki pools (there are two) are warm and fun, especially the water slide; 5) The pool is much warmer than I expected and might even be heated; compared to Grand Wailea or Fairmont Orchid or Hilton Hawaiian Village this pool is much warmer (I love it!) Shopping \u2013 Not much here but the basic sundries and snacks can all be found at Lamont\u2019s. Foodland is only a couple of miles from the hotel, and you can always take a trip to Waikiki if you want to shop. Summary \u2013 Turtle Bay is a gem; if you go expecting a five-star resort you might be disappointed. Turtle Bay isn\u2019t a five-star resort nor does it claim to be one. What I did get is five stars (and then some) of relaxation, which is priceless to me. Don\u2019t go expecting nightlife, and don\u2019t complain about the fact that there isn\u2019t any. You are missing the point of the vacation. By the way, there is plenty of nightlife but you just don\u2019t know about it. Remember, you are a tourist, not a local. I can assure you that there is plenty of nightlife on the North Shore. We were extremely sad to leave; there were tears in our eyes as we drove through the guard shack one last time on the way to Kamehameha Highway.

We booked 6 nights for an Ocean Front Deluxe room, which is considered to be the highest end of regular rooms with a nice size lanai included. I had read in an earlier Trip Advisor review to request a room on the 4th floor or higher and one that has an odd number room number to avoid getting a room with noise from the pool. I checked with the front desk the day before we arrived and they assured me that my room fit those requirements. Just ONE thing I forgot to ask: \u201cIs the view beautiful?\u201d We arrived just in time for sunset tired from our flight and traffic out of Honolulu. Imagine my dismay when I saw that 75% of our view included a large expanse of the red roof of the resort\u2019s ballroom and neither sunset nor sunrise views. I wanted to say something to the front desk but my husband was tired and wanted to stay put for that night. The next morning, I was at the front desk requesting a different room and they were happy to give us room 522 which while on the pool side was far enough from any noise and provided a beautiful sunset view. Here are some short points that might be helpful to future visitors: 1) Obviously, make sure your room is not one that overlooks the ballroom 2) If you have flexibility with your dates, try to stay when there\u2019s a full moon and make a point of getting up early before dawn to see the moon set on the water; absolutely stunning! 3) We booked our room through Blue Hawaii Vacations and saved an amazing amount; it included the Buffet Breakfast and a rental car and still was less than booking just the room directly on the resort\u2019s site. Had a reasonable cancellation policy as well. 4) The Palm Terrace breakfast buffet is worth it if you can have it included in your room price as a special. There\u2019s plenty of variety so even if every dish isn\u2019t delectable, you\u2019ll have plenty of choices. (The made-to-order omelets are great; the scrambled eggs in the covered dish are not.) The evening meals served at the Terrace were hit and miss but they have a very good large salad. Get there before 8:30 p.m. so you can hear the live entertainment instead of the ubiquitous Hawaiian music they pipe in the rest of the time. I liked the music the first two days but I think it was the same tape they played over and over\u2026or at least that\u2019s what it seemed like. Ola and Lei Lei meals were better as was the variety of music. 5) There\u2019s a cement walking path that goes all the way around the buildings and is a nice way to walk off the calories at the end of the day. The walking path that takes you past the stables and into a lovely woods is particularly nice an hour before sunset. 6) Kayaking at the resort was $100 a person and is for beginners and very tame but also enjoyable and instructive. 7) Be aware that the height of the waves picks up from the end of September to March making surfing and snorkeling more of a challenge for beginners. I was told the snorkeling on the North Shore was a lot better April-August because the water is clearer and more areas are accessible. 8) 15 minutes south is Waimea Valley which is a great place to visit on a hot day and you want to do something other than a beach activity. It has a shady paved walkway that ends at a waterfall with plants and flowers from all over the world and a cool archaeological site to visit along the way. 9) Get directions to Turtle Beach (also called Laniakea beach) where you\u2019ll find turtles basking in the sand but please respect them and keep your distance. 10)Twenty minutes south is Haleiwa where you\u2019ll find galleries and shopping and lots of restaurants. The last Saturday of the month there is an Art Walk from 6 to 9 and the galleries and some of the other shops stay open late and offer music and refreshments. We found some art in our price range both at KAI KU HALE right next to a great ice cream shop and at the Haleiwa Art Gallery which is down a bit further and across the street. Take a look at the work by the artist Bailey Leung. He paints miniatures of flowers and landscapes that make nice and relatively speaking affordable keepsakes that are easy to bring back and were priced starting at $75 and up for original works. One other note, my husband was not a snorkeler and as a beginner, I felt I needed a snorkel partner so I asked one of the kayak instructors if he would accompany me. He showed me great spots and helped me navigate areas that I would not have attempted. Contact me if you want his contact information.

However, we did a lot of research on all of the Hawaiian islands and looked into a number of hotels before we decided to stay at Turtle Bay for 10 days. It was very important to us to find a resort that offered a beach on the property (not beach access like a lot of the resorts boasted) and private outdoor space. The ocean front Cottages offered us just that at the best rate we could find on all of the Hawaiian Islands. We arrived in Oahu after 26 hours of traveling only to find a cranky driver and room keys that didn't work. The front desk staff was more than helpful and drove us back to our cottage and stayed to make sure we got in and were happy with our room. We were more than thrilled to find the our room and the view was exactly what we had seen online and in the movie. We stayed at Turtle Bay for 10 days and enjoyed every moment of it. The beach, the pool, the drinks, the hiking, it was all perfect. However, we do highly reccomend renting a car. After two days at the resort we were ready to get out and explore. Thankfully they had an enterprise rent-a-car in the hotel lobby. We went to the local Foodland and got some snacks, beer and wine to keep in our room (this saved us a lot of money, though we didn't find the resort prices to be very expensive at all, paying them for 10 days would have added up very quickly). It also allowed us to explore all that Oahu had to offer (avoid Honolulu). We spent one day just driving around the island admiring the scenery. The food at the hotel was great. We only ate at Hang Ten, Ola and Palm Terrace (for breakfast only because it was included in our room rate) but really enjoyed all of them. We loved the omlets at breakfast, shared the short ribs at Ola almost every night and drank sea orchids at Hang Ten almost every day. We also went to a few shrimp trucks and Ted's Bakery a lot. Both are fantastic. The bottom line is that we did our research before we came here, read the reviews (both positive and negitive) and came here anyway.

I was a bit wary because of some negative reviews concerning the rooms & expensive prices but I'm glad I didn't let these opinions deter me from staying here. I researched this resort a lot & booked it about 5 months in advance through Hotel.com when they had a 20% sale on. I was a bit worried about not getting what I asked for because I didn't book it through the resort's own website but I needn't have worried as all the special requests I made with the booking were granted. I booked a deluxe ocean front room (because I read about the standard room lanai's being too small to sit on) on a high floor & requested an early checkin time of 10am. As soon as we arrived at the resort I was very impressed with not only the lovely grounds & location but also with the very friendly staff. Our room was ready when we arrived at 9.45am & we were on the 4th floor in the west wing with a large lanai with a beautiful view overlooking the pool & surfing beach. Other reviewers have said that the rooms especially the bathroom were in need of an update but honestly I didn't find this the case at all. Our bathroom was fine & so was the furniture in our room. So what if the tv isn't a flat screen although I have read that they are gradually puting them in all the rooms. We dined at the Palm Terrace restaurant & Ola's & enjoyed both meals & I didn't think they were that expensive, no more than a nice restaurant back home in Australia charges. We found plenty of things to do while we were there & could have stayed longer as we didn't get to do everything we wanted. We hired a car for 3 of the 4 days through Enterprise so we could explore the rest of the North Shore & surrounds & so we could dine out at other restaurants than those at the resort. We enjoyed swimming at the main beach & got to see the mother monk seal sunning herself on this beach. We also enjoyed relaxing by the wonderful pools & never had a problem getting a sun lounge even though it was peak season. We went for a walk which took us about an hour & a half to the other beaches that are past the cottages & saw some turtles in the shallow waters & also saw the banyan tree where they filmed Lost & also just finished filming the Pirates of the Carribean IV. We also did a 40 minute helicopter flight with Paradise Helicopters which have a helipad at the resort. We flew over Sacred Falls, which you can only see by helicopter, Kualoa Ranch, Kanohoe Bay, Pearl Harbour, Dole Pineapple Plantation & the North Shore Beaches. It was amazing & worth every penny & we got some great photos. The only thing that I would complain about was the wind in this area. I thought that because we were there in the summer months it wouldn't be very windy but there was a constant wind all the time & the first 2 days it rained on & off especially late afternoon. I also found the temperature to be cooler than I expected for the hottest month of the year. It was much cooler than Waikiki & I would expect it would be rather cool in the winter months. So if you want a nice resort in a beautiful location away from all the hussle & bustle of Waikiki do yourself a favour & stay at this resort. Don't let other people's negative reviews put you off. Go ahead & splurge a little bit & book a deluxe room which is well worth the extra dollars & peace of mind.

This seemed to be independent though. However for the rest, the Bay Restaurant was lacking in any atmosphere whatsoever and the food there very average and expensive to boot, the 'late night bar' was a joke, the barman in there was not interested in serving past 11 pm except on weekends and wasn't exactly friendly even though we were a big group with a thirst and money to spend, so we find ourselves in each others room at the end of each night desperate for somewhere to socialise which is not ideal. In addition I continually felt ripped off at every opportunity, from breakfast being priced ridiculously high, to the outrageous prices for spa treatments which came plus 18% service charge which goes to fund 'mystery costs' and doesn't even cover staff tips so you are welcome to add even more if you like the service!!!, in addition to costs for things such as using the tennis courts, even though unsurprisingly no one was on them, which really should be included.

We couldnt seems to get the timing right to contact her for services. The hotel was nice but the decor was a bit outdated. For me, there wasnt anything here that really justifed the $300/nigt price tag. (Luckily for us - we booked it through Costco and paid 1/3 less when we combined it with our car rental). The room had a great view but could have used a bit \"more\"......The lanai was an outright joke. It literally could only fit 1 chair on it. When you are marketing (in large part ) to couples on romantic getaways - you may want to have enough room for both of them on the balconey to watch the sunset. Im just sayin...... ;) It was a typical resort with resort style prices on everything. I agree with another reviewer - skip the restaurants here and go to Teds Bakery! We were there almost every morning and some times lunch too! We took a surf lesson with the hotel resident provider. The waves that afternoon were not that great and they have us the option to wait for them to pick up or to cancel.... as they wanted to give us the best possible experience. We really appreciated this, as most places will let you got and sit for 2 hours without and wave and still charge you for it!! Eventually it picked up and we had an awesome time (thanks Pat!!). The small beach is nice for laying on but there isnt much else to do there. Its a bit too murky/isnt anything to see for snorkeling. So i suggest you head up the cost to Sharks Cove and or the place right across from Foodland where all the diver go - youll see much more here! The pool area is nice and well maintained and it has a small hottub - that was unimaginably HOT!! I couldnt stay in for more than a few minutes...but it was nice to just sit on he side and hang my legs in. I wish it had been positioned better - as you couldnt sit in it and watch the sunset.....which would have been pretty nice. The shorline is not very nice to stroll along as it is covered in lava rock and is rough on the feet. However, we did see quite a few turtles .......some others we spoke to donned some \"aquasocks\", climbed over the rock and snorkelled with the turtles. They had a business center that you could use for free - which came in handy when we wanted to check in for our flight and print out our boarding passes! They provided you with a \"towel card\" which allowed you to check out a towel on the beach or at the pool. You just exchange one for the other ...and then get it back when you done. This was nice and convenient. They have a $25/day resort fee - which allows you to check out a snorkel set for and hour each day, park etc. I would have referred it included a bottle of water/day.

The only plus was this view was better than our last because it looked out across the beach and Ola restaurant - breathtaking! Our other view with the lanai was the ocean looking through palm trees and at a wedding below. However, as another guest commented, there was a horrible smell in the room that we could not locate and the a/c was loud so we didn't get much sleep at night. We spent 3 nights there and arrived home today exhausted. Also may have been due to the couple next door that were arguing, slamming doors and throwing things around their room last night at 2 in the morning......The guests on the other side of us thought that it was okay to smoke on the balcony even though there is a non smoking sign clearly posted on the door....HELLO!!

This visit was to relax and get away from it - the north shore is perfect for that. I have to agree with another reviewer about the wait staff at the pool. It seemed hard work to get their attention and order food/drinks etc. and paying for it was a very slow process. On 2 separate days, we had to track our waitresses down to settle the bill after they had left it for us. I have left reviews for the other restaurants including Ola, Lei Lei's and 21 Degrees North - all pretty good! Overall, I would have to say that this was a good visit. Yes, it is older furnished and there was an unpleasant smell. For the price of the rooms, people do expect more. However, my main problems were caused by other guests and not by the staff or the hotel.

The room choices are a bit confusing on the website, but clear once you get there. For my money, upgrade to the Ocean Front- bigger balcony (or request it). The ocean view rooms are the same size as the Ocean Front, but the views are so much better from Ocean Front. Also, with Ocean Front you fall asleep to the pounding waves. The bigger balcony is great, because more than one person can sit on it. The little balconies are little. Barely one chair can fit. We had friends who stayed in the suites, They were big, but you're not in the room much, at least we weren't, so it seems like a waste to me. We also had friends who got an Ocean Front Cottage. Very nice. Big room. Patio that over-looks the bay. Not really a private beach though, no where to lay out. But, they were very nice. You get more personal service. Better parking, you own concierge. Free day rentals of equipment, etc. Lots of perks. This is an open resort. The beaches, even the pool, can be visited by anyone. So, the beach gets a little crowded. It's also a family resort, so lots of kids. It got a little loud by the pool. (No, I do not have kids. Didn't bother me, just loud) All the restaurants were really good. But, after a while, all the dishes were somewhat similar. There is variety, but if you're staying for a while--rent a car and explore the surrounding area. The snorkeling is just okay. Much of the coral has been killed by bad snorkelers who stand on it and kill it. So, there's not much to see. If you're going, and are going to snorkel, please be mindful of mother nature. Treat the coral, turtles, fish, etc with respect and allow it to regrow. There is a $25 resort fee (per day). Which I'm not a fan of.

This resort is consider to be the \"country\" side of the island. It takes about 1 hour (maybe a little bit more, during busy hours) to go out to the downtown area of Honolulu. There are many nice food places around, by saying that, I don't mean restaurant, but little trucks that sell food, those are delicious! **SNORKELING** I thought snorkeling was a bit disappointing... There are fishes, but nothing CRAZY to see, unless your super lucky. But that's not the worst part, if your really thinking of snorkeling by turtle bay, be careful of the corals, those are sharp and can cut deep. I've read about this hotel, and the review before going, and I was very careful while I was snorkeling, but my friend and I still got cut deeply. And the worst part was, the so call \"first-aid\" kit they had only had band-aid, and since they don't have any anti-bacterial stuff, they tell you that salt water is good for killing germs. My friends and I went to this resort because we knew there was a beach that was very private, and would be the best for proposal, I actually emailed the management on their website, they didn't reply (prior to going to the hotel). And when we got there, we spoke to a lot of people, still wasn't clarify. We spoke to a really nice lady, I believe her name was christina, and was trying to help us set up for the dinner on the beach, she gave us some numbers to call, and we did. Turns out the person was on vacation, and we try to find christina again, but on our way trying to find christina again, some lady wouldn't let us contact christina, instead she gave us some other numbers. . . And the way she spoke to my friend and I were very unacceptable, I don't work there, don't talk to me as if your my boss. In the end, all the phone number, all the people we spoke to was useless, no one knew anything, and the people we called, called us back after a couple of days. Which was pointless, because it the proposal was done already. We ended up planning it at another location, at another hotel. **The restaurants** I only went to one of the restaurant, I believe the name was Ola, it is basically eating by the beach, and its really beautiful. The food was a bit over priced, and it wasn't super delicious. I ordered drinks with my friend, and she totally forgot my drink, and ask if I want anything... very forgetful, when i told her 2 minute ago. But otherwise, it's a good place to eat, good experience, very romantic. Overall, I'm satisfied with the experience, I really enjoy the location of the hotel, although it is a bit far from the central area of honolulu, but it was a very tropical experience. The rooms were nicely cleaned everyday, and the house keepers are really nice. The furnitures are a bit old, but who care? Look at the damn view!!!

We did not do any research until the week before our honeymoon and we got very nervous when we started to see bad reviews on Trip Advisor. I could not be more relieved and happy to tell you that they were totally wrong and we had a wonderful experience! Lodging: We stayed in one of the beach front cottages (again, like in the movie). It was beautiful. The bathroom is large and has a soaking tub big enough for two. Plus, if you like, you can get spa services brought in to enhance the experience. Right after we got settled in, we got a phone call and champagne, with an orchid floating on the ice, was brought to our room to welcome us! Very nice! Food: Room service, while expensive, was prompt and tasty. We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast (delicious omelets) at the hotel restaurant and dining at Olas. All around good food experience. However, if you want more authentic experience, leave the resort and head north. On the way, you will pass many shrimp trucks full of delicious, fresh, (sloppy!) treats. Also, we had breakfast at the Hukilau Cafe (kinda hard to find - have a GPS) and it was delicious. Services: My husband golfed and said it was great (but windy). He was especially pleased they let him go out without a foursome so he actually got some alone time, with no need to rush through. I went and had a sea-side massage. While the massage itself was wonderful and relaxing, I was disappointed with the spa amenities. Basically, there is nothing to do before/after your treatment to enhance your spa experience. But, with the beach so close, it does not really matter. Not sure I would have spent a lot of time there anyway. Other: The staff was incredibly helpful and polite throughout our stay. Through the concierge we booked our trip for the Polynesian Cultural Center (I would pass on this) and a helicopter ride. She was great at helping us figure out which packages to book /when to go.

We spent 2 days in Waikiki and were thrilled to leave the busy city to head to the more remote north shore for a true Hawaiian resort experience. The \"bones\" of this resort are excellent. Great location, large oceanfront rooms, miles of great beaches in every direction and good restaurants. But I have to say, we considered it somewhat of a missed opportunity. It is a property that has\"lost it's luster.\" My rating should be somewhere in between a 3 and a 4 if TA had that capability. I will add that our experience was in the main hotel and not the cottages or villas (which I've heard are considerably more luxurious). The rooms are very large, freshly painted, clean with comfortable beds. We had a spectacular ocean front location with a large lanai to watch the sunset. The rooms were so large that they seemed empty and stark. Not much in the way of design as there were no pictures or even simple touches to add elegance. Old style TV's had difficulty reading the remote and staying clear. No mini bar but an empty fridge (nice touch) but there were no wine glasses or openers with which to toast the sunset on the lanai. The bathrooms, although clean, are dated and in need of upgrades. Linens and towels are thin, rough and small. Common areas could also use upgrades to add luxury. Hallways had framed posters instead of artwork. The expansive lobby was too bright and not elegant. Landscaping around the property had empty spots and patches of old and tired plantings. Pathways to regularly visited areas (restaurants, shops, elevators, game room, picturesque cliffs) go passed dumpsters and the underbelly of the hotel. Palm Terrace, the breakfast/buffet restaurant offered large quantities and choices of mediocre quality options. Bakery items could very well have come from Costco. If our rate did not include breakfast we would not have visited every day. Staff was very friendly and very helpful. We were pleasantly surprised with the caliber of most of the other restaurants on the property. We had excellent dining experiences at Ola, Lei Lei's and 21 degrees. A complaint is that most dining locations offered similar menu types. Different style restaurants (Japanese, Italian, etc.) would be welcomed when you are a captive audience and there are not many off property options. A desire for only a lite bite at the Bay Club bar offered probably the worst pizza we have ever had and included very poor service. The Front desk staff and especially the concierge could sorely use some additional training. The concierge had not even visited all the restaurants on the resort's property and could offer no menu's or recommendations for local locations off property. Totally useless. Are they only there to sell tours?? The beach is accessible with a friendly/helpful staff. More shade umbrellas would be appreciated. I wish they didn't make their pool towel process like getting a loan from a bank but I will admit that it gets the guests to clean up after themselves. Summertime afforded a good opportunity for learning to surf. The poolside scuba was also a great plus. We did not partake in golf, tennis or horseback riding. And lastly........Management............please, please, please........like most high end resorts around the country and around the world..........convert the entire hotel to NON SMOKING!!! The North Shore of Oahu has so much to offer for those who like to explore. It is a truly lovely location and we had a wonderful week here.

When we checked in at 7 pm, only 1 room was ready so we went out for dinner at Ola's ($180 for 5 people). At 9 pm our other room was ready, but come to find out it had only one bed so they had to roll in a cot (which they said they wouldn't charge us for -- gee, how nice!) The next morning they sent someone to our room to inform me that I could not smoke outside on the balcony. The third day they were able to change us to a smoking-balcony room and we finally got a room for our kids with enough beds to go around, but it cost us an entire 1/2 day to deal with the situation and shuffle everyone around. Because our rooms were not adjoining and there was a lot of back and forth between rooms, we wedged a flip-flop in our door to keep it ajar so we didn't have to constantly get up to open the door. This prompted a visit from Security who informed us we couldn't leave the door ajar \"for security reasons\" and \"for our own protection.\" We have done this in hotel rooms from Bangkok to NYC with complete safety, so we can only assume that there is some crime wave at TBR which makes it unsafe to even keep your door ajar while inside your room. When I went to the front desk to discuss this with the manager, I was given the same speech that I got from security -- \"not allowed...for security reasons.\" The resort is very lovely, in a great location, and quite picturesque. The rooms are large and clean. But even though TBR is completely dependent on your tourism dollar to stay in business, they behave as if serving you is just a big annoyance. The staff was stunningly inhospitable and had no desire to make us feel welcome or satisfied. For all of our trouble, they didn't so much as comp us a free soda at the pool even after speaking to the manager! As a result of the deplorable service we didn't spend much time there. The local mom & pop shops, however, are very glad to have your business, are very warm and friendly, and not nearly as expensive. The town of Hale'iwa is 10 minutes away with a great selection of restaurants and shops. You can get to Honolulu in 40 minutes and there are plenty of attractions between the resort and downtown. My one last criticism is that there are only 3 washers/dryers for the entire resort, one of which was out of service. I finally had success doing some laundry (after trying for 3 nights) when I made up a sign-up sheet for washer/dryer time. This really helped quell a lot of the hostility of people trying to use the machines. Even still, it took 4 hours to do 3 loads of wash because of the backlog. One great element is the ease of viewing sea turtles in Turtle Bay (on the west side of the hotel.) Thrilling. All in all, Turtle Bay provides a nice place to sleep and a beautiful place to wake up, but other than that I give them a big thumbs down.

We really expected a delayed response, but within 5 minutes Melissa called right back and moved us to some rooms in the South wing with spectacular views. We had 2 king rooms and 1 junior suite - all were wonderful. The hotel was switching out mattresses for new ones while we were there, so I don't know if the mattress on which my husband and I slept was new or not, but it was so incredibly comfortable. We slept like babies every night. The property is amazing. The swimming beach is fantastic, the pools are wonderful (perfect water temp), and the walking trails are beyond description. We walked for hours daily, and loved every secret beach we found. The place is like something in a dream - just beautiful. The restaurants are very good - and very pricy. We were satisfied with the variety, and did not get bored eating at the hotel every day. We did rent a car one day to go into Haleiwa, and stopped at the famous Ted's. WOW - amazing food!!! Do not miss the pies and bbq! I think one of the best parts of Turtle Bay is the staff. Every single person speaks, and is genuinely eager to make your stay as perfect as possible. When (not if, just book it!) you go, make a point to get to know Thomas at the bag check/valet desk. Our family fell in love with him - what a sweetheart.

My husband also lost his wedding ring on the main beach and we contacted lost and found on the same day and I have also contacted the hotel since we got home but no answer. They have a person that goes around the beach with a metal detector a couple of times a week, so they should haefound it by now, but still we have not heard anything from them. Contrary to what most reviews on here say, the room was really nice, modern and not at all dated. We had a room with a small lanai (balcony) overlooking the main beach and Ola's restaurant which was a really good view. After the maids made up the beds they put Hawaiian music on the radio which was a nice touch. One very bad thing about the room was that the fire alarm didn't work! There was a fire alarm going off on one of the mornings and I only found out as I walked out into the main corridor and heard it there. The alarm had then been going off for a long time and no one had come knocking at the doors either. We evacuated the building and walked around to the main entrance. There were still several people sitting on their balconies as if nothing was wrong. We stood outside waiting until we got bored and walked back into reception where everything seemed to be as normal. Whe asked the check-in personell if it was safe to go back in the building and they told us it was but did not give any more information. We also told them the fire alarm in our room did not work and no one had been knocking on the doors. The did not seemed bothered. The food in the restaurants is good but extremely overpriced. The only ok value is the buffet. The servers in Lei Lei's and in the sports bar are nice, but the servers for the buffet are very rude. I would recommend eating in other local places including the shrimp trucks and breakfast at Ted's bakery is very nice and good value. We only went to the pool area once and it was very nice, clean and lots of spaces and clean towels and free drinking water. We also rented bikes one day and cycled arond the hotel grounds. This is a good way to explore the area and the nature around the hotel is gorgeous. We went on our bikes past the stables, a few beaches, to the WWII bunker and the Lost banyan tree. The surf guy you have to rent the bikes from though is very strange and gave us one price and then when we went to pay put the price up! All in all Turtle Bay is a very nice hotel in an absolutely gorgeous location and there is lots to do and see, but just be aware the prices and the service which is the big minus for this place.

I love how close it is to surf spots where surfing became legendary. I love the beautiful lobby with spectacular views out floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The tranquility and beautiful setting\u2014just a short drive from Honolulu International Airport--certainly match my idea of how a resort can be \u201ctrue hawai\u2019i\u201d. Most of the food was really good. We dined at Ola\u2019s Restaurant both times. In 2008 we dined at 21 Degrees North. Multiple times we ate lunch at the Palm Terrace...and several times at both Lei Lei\u2019s Bar/Grill and Hang Ten Bar/Grill. In 2008 we mainly hung out at the pool, watched the surfing near the hotel, and drove to the nearby surfing beaches to watch waves/surfers. In 2009 we did the Paradise Helicopters tour of Oahu which was awesome (arranged by the hotel concierge). We also drove down the windward coast to beautiful Kailua Beach and (on another day) to Dole Plantation. On both stays, I spent a significant amount of time on my room balcony. A new discovery for me: the Segway tour! [see \u201cactivities\u201d at Turtle Bay Resort website] My husband noticed the \u201cSegway trail rides\u201d sign near the kiosk standing along the main resort road. Having done a Minneapolis riverfront Segway tour, he wanted more of this. I didn\u2019t imagine how fun this would be!!..and how suited it is for scenic Hawaii. We booked the 90-minute off-road trail tour (which includes a 30-minute mandatory training session). Then we headed out with our guide on a route with breathtaking views of secluded beaches, ironwood forests, and historic landmarks. (see my Trip Advisor video) The fun and the scenery were exhilarating! It was so fun that I\u2019ll be searching for more Segway tours on future travels!

Turtle Bay has the most magnificent setting I've seen for a Hawaiian Hotel. While I love the pools at the Grand Wailea and Kyatt Kauai they feel too removed from the ocean. This hotel sits out on a peninsula with waves crashing all around it. It feels wild and natural. The pool has a fun slide for the kids, but there's also a great swimming beach on one side of the hotel. We stayed in the cottages (sign up as a \"preferred hotels\" member on their website and you get upgraded one room category), but had to move to a suite after 3 days because the cottages were fully booked. It was worth every penny to be right at the ocean's edge. In fact, I think I would only stay in the cottages. A few downers, like the sheets not staying put on the beds, and it's got a little mustiness to be expected from an oceanfront hotel built in 1973. But any negatives were quickly outweighed by the perfect setting. It was great to finally have a place where my husband could walk out the door and go surfing, and we could watch from the patio. Food was great at \"Ola\" the beachfront restaurant. This was one of those places where everything was easy.

We had a great time and didn't mind that things weren't perfect. It is true that some things are rusty, but this IS Hawaii, which is known for it's tendancy to turn everything metal into rust. I would say that considering how fast things rust here, they do a good job keeping on top of it. We found the room, (Ilima suite, which we shared with family) to be very nice and nicely kept. The beds were comfortable and the views unmatched. Yeah, it is true that the bathrooms are not as updated as the rooms themselves, but it did not bother us. The staff was absolutely wonderful, so nice and always went the extra mile. We found the food to be very good, at all the restaurants. My husband and I also went surfing at the onsite surfing school, and I have to concur that, from my perspective I didn't feel at all safe out there surfing. In fact, I'm surprised that they even let children of any age go out on the water. I consider myself to be in fairly good shape, but I was completely taken aback at how hard surfing was. It looks easy from the shore but I was completely exhausted within 20 minutes of fighting the waves. If you are an excellent specimen, then I say go for the surf lessons, but if you are not in peak condition you will not do well out there and perhaps not enjoy it. I think surf lessons here might be complicated by the fact that the surf is really harsh. Which is great for professional surfers, but not so good for beginners. It is also complicated by the fact that it breaks against rocks and not a beach with makes entry and exit difficult for us newbies. Anyway, I hate to complain about anything, because we had such a wonderful time. My daughter (6 years) LOVED the pony/horse rides and she did them almost every day. It became part of our daily ritual. I also went to Spa Luna and had a facial and it was heavenly, as was the outdoor lounging area for the spa. I highly reccommend it!

I was a little concerned about previous reviews as some seem so negative but I'm very glad to say that overall it was a beautiful place to stay. Check in was simple and straight forwards. We had no problems at all. We parked for ourselves in the car park and didn't use the valet parking. Its about 5 minutes walk from the check in desk. I don't honestly know what other reviewers are moaning about - parking was so easy. We always found a space and its no distance to walk. The room: It was spacious and very clean. I am a bit anal about being clean and hate dirty places but I couldn't find anything to moan about which my husband was very glad!! The view from our 4th floor lanai was beautiful if a little spoiled by the ugly roof (why haven't they turfed it??). We avoided this by moving the chairs to face the sunset but as we were on the end of the wing it was easy to not see. But I would imagine if you were nearer the middle of the hotel it may be a problem. The bathroom was spacious and clean and they left gorgeous products from the spa for our complimentry use. Yes, its a little dated but it was all in working order and we had no complaints. I particulary liked the separate dressing room that leads onto the bathroom as this meant we both had lots of room to get ready. Tea and coffee making equipment is in this area too and is complimentry. It also has a fridge which was fab for storing beer/wine/food. The beaches: both were beautiful in their own way and neither were ever crowded despite being open to the public. We saw turtles feeding on Turtle beach and my husband snorkled on the other beach and saw a few fish. The pool: this also was never crowded - which is great when you take account that the hotel has 900 rooms and was nearly full the whole time we were there. We enjoyed the smaller dipping pool with pina colada smoothies the most! There are 3 pools, one big for the serious swimmers, the dip pool and a shallow pool with a slide for kids. There is also two jacuzzi's. There were lots of families with children at the resort but we never felt it was a problem. The food: TB has 5 restaurants. We tried the palm terrace for dinner and it was lovely food and wine, but the atmosphere was dead! No-one talked! There wasn't any music, if it hadn't of been for the excellent company I would have been a little bored! This was our most expensive meal on the resort. We also had breakfast there once. For nearly \u00a350 I'd expect it to be more special. I know american's don't generally 'do' hot tea, but, frankly, it was awful. Yes they had lots of things but it was for example 5 types of bread which took up space and piles of cakes ect. Also they had a bit of a fly problem which was unpleasant. Service was okay but not that great. We didn't bother with 21 Degree's as the menu was so fussy and expensive. Also after our Palm Terrace experience we decided that it was probably better not to bother. Then we thought we would try the Bay Club which is supposed to be a 'sports bar' We thought it would be a little more lively but it wasn't! It was so dark in there we couldn't see our dinner! The food was okay but nothing to wow you with. Everyone had gone by 9.30pm. We had room service breakfast once and it was such bad value that I would not recommend it to anyone. So much cash ($50) for not much in the way of food. However! Don't let that put you off! We ate at Lei Lei's which is the place on the golf course. This place was so much better. The food was lovely and you could tell people were enjoying themselves. The service was excellent. I would recommend this place definately. Our favourite by far was Ola's. Its a beautiful restaurant right on the beach. The staff were all lovely and friendly, and the food was superb. We ate there 3 times and had our last meal there. If you eat anywhere at TB eat at Ola's! So Turtle Bay. Yes its a bit dead at night but hey, we were on our honeymoon so it didn't bother us!! I think it would be quite boring if you went alone or you didn't get on that well with your partner. We used it as a base because we knew lots of places to go to have fun. Make sure you hire a car so you can explore a bit. There are two towns nearby (Halewia and Laie) where you can find entertainment/food at a more reasonable price. For example, do not under any circumstances miss Teds Bakery for breakfast! (try the bacon and egg breakfast sandwich, yum) We went to Sharks cove (across the road from teds) and my husband snorkled with shoals of fish not just 3-4. Also make a trip to Lanikai beach and sunset beach - so beautiful. Its a shame the hotel restaurants let it down a bit and the other niggles like the $25 service charge for 'free' newspapers that are by the lifts not delivered to your room. Also we didn't use their snorkle gear as we had our own so TB basically got $225 for nothing which was annoying. My husband played golf twice and enjoyed himself very much. Both golf courses were immaculate and very beautiful (complete with resident Egrets!) Prices are very reasonable after 2pm if you can stand the heat. Playing at 7am is expensive but worth it as the course is empty. We also made use of the spa and had the couples massage in the cabana (aka shed!) This was expensive but so relaxing after our mammoth flight. If you can afford it, do it! I would recommend TB to others but would also warn them of what we found. Its an old hotel at the end of the day which wouldn't be allowed to be built now. This does compensate for the dips in quality/money spent. We totally enjoyed our time at TB and would stay there again. Its a beautiful place and if you can stay there with the same approach as we had you won't go far wrong.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBuyer beware!\u201d", "Author": "luvtotravel4me", "ReviewID": "UR68347956", "Content": "We were disappointed in the Resort at Turtle Bay.

He took care of my birthday dinner reservation and even had champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries sent to my room on my birthday - they were delicious. Would highly recommend Ola as a place to eat - right on the beach, laid back atmosphere and excellent food - you have got to try the pork nachos. We had booked dinner at 21 North, the fine dining restaurant, but found it a little too formal, so we simply enjoyed a cocktail and headed for Ola again. The pool overlooked the sea and never felt crowded. A great place to enjoy cocktails and snacks. The Palm Terrace restaurant does a great breakfast. Some people have complained the prices are too steep, there is a lack of breakfast choices and nothing to do in the evenings. You cannot expect to stay at a resort like this and not pay high prices. There was adequate breakfast choices and if you go expecting lots of nightlife then book a hotel in Honolulu instead.

POSITIVES: View and Balcony: Spectacular (see my pictures). Very nice, breathtaking, unobstructed views of pool area, palm trees, beach and surf. It was nice because once the kids went down to sleep, my wife and I could sit on the balcony at night, drink a glass of wine and soak in all the night time views of the beach and waves. Staff: We arrived late due to several travel delays and I mentioned to the front desk that it was my anniversary. The next afternoon the hotel had left a bottle of champagne in the room courtesy of the hotel manager. Very nice. In addition, one day we asked the concierge for information about walking trails on the property which turned into an impromptu tour of the entire property aboard on the hotel\u2019s golf carts fully narrated by one of the concierge staff. Fun for the kids and very informative. Jacuzzi: There are a couple of Jacuzzi strategically located around the property. The one away from the pool area and close to the surf was AMAZING!! Loved sitting in the Jacuzzi and watching the huge waves pound the beach. Lobby: Amazing and spacious lobby with great places to sit around and chat/take in the wonderful views of the ocean. NEUTRALS: Location: Excellent getaway location . . out of the way of everything else. Nice beach on the property but for a quiet retreat there are several nice secluded beaches within a 10 minute walk. The only problem is there are not a lot of affordable food choices close to the property so you are stuck with the restaurants on the property which tend to be pricey. Also it is a long drive from the airport, especially after a long flight to get to the hotel. Room: The d\u00e9cor was a little dated and worn. The carpet could use a replacing in the room we were in. The bed was nice as were the linens. The bathroom was acceptable. Pool: Nice with waterslide for the kids but not heated so the pool was VERY cold. Even if they heated it a little it would be great. NEGATIVES: Weather: The wind was howling both days we were there. It is my understanding that it is always windy at the resort. I personally hate wind so it was a big detraction against me going back. Snorkeling: The snorkeling off the beach adjacent to the property was not very interesting. The water was not super clear and tended to be a little rough. Not that it bothered me but it certainly may bother a beginner snorkeler. No free Internet: This is 2010 and my new pet peeve . . wireless Internet should be free somewhere in your hotel or hardwire Internet should be free in your room. SUMMARY: If you are looking for a getaway resort, you probably cant beat this hotel on Oahu. All in all, I would stay here again but pray hard that the wind would die down for the visit.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jefferson City Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Miss This Experience\u201d", "Author": "traveldent", "ReviewID": "UR67303882", "Content": "It has been a few years since we stayed at Turtle Bay.

When we first arrived we were greeted and upgraded to a suite for the first 2 nights but it seemed older and not as nice as the standard room we stayed in the last night.

The sand is very rough and the beach wasnt crowded at all. All in All it was a nice place to visit just to say I have, but probably wouldnt stay their again. While on the north shore you gotta try the glazed doughnuts at teds bakery and the shrimp truck was great. The Dole plant was neat to see but was kind of boring.

We read ahead of time some complaints about the food prices, but to be quite honest we didn't really notice them to be any higher than any other hawaiian resort or mainland resort for that matter. The hotel set us up with a great scuba diving shop down the road in Hale'iwa called Deep Ecology. They are a small shop with great down to earth staff that know their business. Their prices were quite good too. There are also several places to eat and shop in Hale'iwa if you don't want to drive into the crowds and traffic in Honolulu. I can honestly say if Turtle Bay wasn't there, we wouldn't even consider going back to Oahu. There is so much to do at the resort you don't even need to leave.

We noticed that just about all the rooms have some sort of water view, but if you can afford it, I HUGHLY recommend the beach cottages. It is like your own little bungalow on the beach.

When we arrived at the restaurant, there were no window seats available, and they wanted to put us in the middle of the restaurant at a table with no view. When I explained to the hostess that we were celebrating a special occasion, and that our reservation was made months in advance, she scoffed and told me that everyone had made advanced reservations and that we would have to wait at the bar if we wanted a table with a view. I seriously doubt anyone else had booked as far in advance as we did. We waited approximately 30 minutes and were each offered a free drink for the inconvenience. I have no complaints about the meal - it was fabulous, although ridiculously overpriced I found the cleanliness of the hotel, especially the rooms, to be unacceptable and sub-standard. The carpet in our room was absolutely filthy! The carpet was not being vacuumed regularly; (although I did ask for it to be, and left a tip for the maid everyday) the bottom of my feet were black from walking on the carpet. I wore my flip flops in the room during our entire stay. I also saw a very large, dead cockroach in the hallway between our room and the room next to ours.

We had researched and read up on Turtle bay for a couple months prior to going. I have to agree with one reviewer who asked if the people who sent in negative reviews actually stayed at the same place we did because our stay was perfect from beginning to end. Beginning with the airport ..had rental car arranged and it was a breeze through buget..we upgraded to jeep with removable hard top and it was the best thing we could have done....we had that roof off the entire time..couple times it started to sprinke and it was a hoot and would stop before we could decide whether to put top back on!! We arrived at the resort at about 9pm. Have to admit the drive in the dark and rain when you first leave the airport was alittle intimidating on unfamiliar highway but we made it no problem. Check in was quick and hassle free. We were originally assigned to a room on 2nd floor and we asked to be moved up to higher floor. they were booked for the night but the next day we were moved to the 6th floor. In all honesty if we had to stay on the 2nd floor it would have been ok..view was beautiful looking over the pool to ocean but the view from our 6th floor was AMAZING!!! The room was roomy with king sized bed, desk, couple chairs. Bathroon setup was neat..you walk into outer bathroom with sink and large vanity and huge closet, mini fridge and little cart with the coffee maker and coffee stuff. safe in the closet worked well and was easy to use. Then you walked into ajoining bathroom with another large vanity and sink , toilet and shower. plenty of towels and generous supply of great smelling toiletries everyday. I remember someone wrote review and complained how everything in room had price tag attached and you couldnt even drink coffee without paying. Not true!! You get fresh supply of coffee, tea bags, sweenteners and creamer everyday..there is a little sign on cart that you can purchase their turtle bay mugs for 5.00$ and there is bottled water in room at 3.00 $ a bottle. We purchased the same brand of hawaiian water at the foodland for next to nothing and kept in fridge. I personally loved the bedding and the bed. The open air lobby is amazing!! the carpets in the whole place looked clean and fresh..the entire place is spotless I'm telling you!! There are several different pool options..the large main pool which by the way I rarely saw more than a handful of people in. I think deep end was 11ft. couple little kids pool one with slide even adults could use, and I think at least two hot tubs. tons of lounge chairs and tables and umbrellas. The grounds surrounding the pool had this super soft, cushiony grass. They have these big tiki torches all over and light at night. They also have large spotlights shinning out at certain spots all along the edge of property that borders ocean and at night you can look out to water. I saw a bunch of turtles one day on the side of pool going toward the cottage direction. We ordered drinks from the hang ten bar several times...I really recommend the lava flow..they were consistanly good. This is the one area I was less than thrilled with...they have a couple waitresses who would come around to you and ask if you wanted anything and then deliver it to you and start a tab for you...somedays they'd be real consistant others they'd come to the people right beside you several times without ever acknowledging you. This happened more than once so I actually used this as my meter on whether to spend 10.00 on a drink..if they asked I got one and if they didn't I didn't. My husband golfed a few times and both the courses and he loved both of them. Said the guys were nice and helpful and the experience was what he'd hoped it would be as a golf lover. I went exploring on these days...if you walk in the direction of the cottages and just keep going you'll come to the WWll bunker and on further a bay where they kayak, and you'll see their horse stables and horses. What you won't see?? people!! I swear if you walk and distance on the main resort beach you will soon feel as if you are the only one there!! If you go the direction of the main swimming and snorkling area you find another empty beach unless like me you look up and find yourself staring at a huge seal!!! the last couple days we saw seals here. Oh!! speaking of walking...when my husband had us invest in +90.00 keen waterproof sandals I thought it was alittle much. WRONG!!!! You must have decent water shoes/sandals with that rugged sole for the northshore!!! I can't stress this enough...we would not have been able to see, do, explore half the stuff we did without them. Those rocks in places are like sharp glass!! The tide pools especially...they're everywhere and full of cool fish but again the rocks are like jagged glass. We had kind of avoided Ola's because figured it was too expensive. Then we went for lunch one day and it was the best lunch we'd had!!! You can get a burger for like 9.00 at lunch. I got the fresh fish of the day sandwich and it was 15.00 but got great salad for only 1.00!!!! extra instead of fries and it was the best fish I ever had. Do take note however on one thing...when reading the menu the one side had Entrees listed and the prices were higher than the average lunch type things so we thought that part of the menu was the dinner side...loved it so much went there for supper the same night...different menu !! alot of the things you got at lunch were now way more expensive and the entrees jumped in price..but still remember this my fellow foodies...this food especially the fresh fish is heavenly AND you get a ton of food with the main item all included in the price..I had fresh fish and it came sitting on top of huge pile of all kinds of vegetables including purple sweet potatoes. they don' nickle and dime you for side dishes. The service at lunch and dinner was excellent and the view....you are sitting on the beach staring at the ocean!!!!! I wish we had discovered Ola's earlier in trip. ate at the palm terrace..good shrimp and crab hash for breakfast and the spicy shrimp at dinner while almost too hot was really good, but this place way too expensive and they do nickle and dime you and charge for salad or fries etc.. too many other places to spend less money for more food. We went to Haleiwa town and it was fun. we got out shave ice at Aoki's and it was really good. No reason to stand in the crazy line at the more famous place next door. Teds bakery ..i actually liked their food better than bakery items . food is really good and huge portions!!! Try Fumi's shrimp truck..I got the spicy garlic and hubby got the coconut shrimp. I loved mine but didnt think his was that great . did get the famous sweet corn..it was really good but had no butter on it. wasnt sure if thats how they eat it so we ate plain. Stop at Waimea falls park. This place is beautiful..I felt like we were in Jurassic park. Made it to the falls...life guard there that day so my husband got to swim under the falls. He said it was great..water 30 ft deep!! The famous jumping rock at waimea beach across the street is really neat in a terrifying way...these people would climb and climb to top of this huge rock formation then wait for a good wave and jump!! big sign saying jumping here could cause injury or death made for humorous backdrop to my pics!! we drove all the way to chinaman's hat and that beach is beautiful. we also drove toward Haleiwa town and passed a beach where these MASSIVE sea turtles come ashore to bask in sun...you'll know you're at the right place because traffic suddenly becomes heavy and slow. find a place to park across the street and check it out. You really have to be right beside them to appreciate how huge and beautiful they are. About the wind at the resort..I'd say it ranged from brezzy to blustery but it felt great!! it kept you from ever really feeling hot. You really need to use the sunscreen too...that sun on your skin is Hot at times. I know this is jumping around but I'm still so excited I keep thinking of things so you have perfect vac like us!! for cheap but tasty meal check out the foodland grocery store. one night we bought one of those bbq chickens that they have made up and some pre cut veggies with dip and a couple pieces of Teds pie...they sell at foodland too, and had ourselfs a picnic that was less than 20.00 and we were stuffed and happy. Also, every morning there is a pastry cart up in the front lobby that opens at 6am. once we discovered that, our breakfast dilemma was solved...for 10.00 for the two for us we'd get 4 pastries and two cups of really good, fresh coffee. they also have all kinds of fresh fruit and yogurts and cold sandwiches pretty cheap. this is actually a pretty helpful place if you need to watch your food money. Virginia was always working and was very friendly. Every employee we encountered was kind, helpful and sincere. we were constantly greeted and asked if we needed help. Oh!! another pretty cheap but really good place to eat breakfast was Kono's in Haleiwa town. their bagel concoctions are really good. I tell you people...I literally had a lump in my throat more that once the last two days just thinking about leaving...I can only imagine the person who goes to what can only be described as heaven on earth and complain about a too small bathroom or old carpet must be one sad person indeed. Oh!!! one more thing. our flight out didn't leave till 1030pm. so the desk told us we could stay till 12:30 to check out. so we hung out did stuff , had lunch at Ola's and laid by pool....then we figured we'd head into Waikiki and honolulu. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!! got to the general area of honolulu around 4pm sat . crazy traffic, nothing to look at but ugly , industrial type buildings and lots of run down everything...even with our navigator it was impossible to get anywhere we tried to go....things started to look up when suddenly I saw we were in Chinatown...unless we were in the wrong Chinatown or the wrong side of it , it was two blocks of absolute slum!!! I was shocked by the boarded up windows, graffiti ect. we actually drove to airport 3hrs early rather than deal with this area. just did not feel safe at all. It was actually shocking and I can't imagine that there are people who go to waikiki and honolulu only and probably think they saw the real hawaii. we returned car to buget...even easier than checking in, and explored and ate at airport. lots of shops there actually and a restaurant called Dewars not bad if a little expensive.

We spent three nights at the Kahala Resort near Honolulu, and then two nights at Turtle Bay Resort up on the North Shore. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Turtle Bay, but not as much as the Kahala. To be fair, we also paid about half the price to stay at Turtle Bay, so I still consider the return on value to be good. I gave the Resort the benefit of the doubt with the four-star review, I would really consider this to be about a three and a half star resort. The resort sits on an absolutely beautiful location on the North Shore, with ocean right outside the doors of the hotel as far as the eyes can see. We enjoyed wandering around the property grounds quite a bit. There are sandy, quiet beaches for swimming and snorkeling, and rocky beaches with bigger waves for surfing. We went on a guided kayaking excursion one morning on property and had an outstanding time. They also had a wonderful, multi-tiered pool complex with plenty of chairs for relaxing. My wife and I thought the view from our fifth floor oceanfront lanai was the best we have ever seen, and we travel quite a bit. So, it seems like Turtle Bay has the outdoor parts of the resort figured out, and they are 5-star all the way. Unfortunately, I felt the indoor parts of the resort need some significant work. Except for the beautiful view from our lanai, our king room was nothing special. The bathrooms are screaming out to be remodeled. They are nowhere near the quality they need to be for a place that wants to be considered a true luxury resort. They reminded me of any motel that you can pull into on any highway anywhere in the mainland. I was very disappointed in the dining offered in this resort. They have you captive on the property and it shows. I can't remember getting worse value for dollar paid on food at any resort in my travels. The dinner buffets, priced at a similar point to the very best buffets at an elite Vegas resort, offered very few food selections, disinterested staff, and poor quality. There isn't a lot to do at night, so I wandered around the shops at the resort some and found them to be quite disappointing as well. An awful lot of touristy junk being sold that you wouldn't find at a true first class type of resort. Be aware as well that you will get hit with the dreaded \"resort fee\" here. I think it was $25/day or so when we were there. What I got out of that practically was \"free parking,\" so I guess I paid $25/night to park. I think it was also supposed to include a newspaper every morning, (never saw one) fitness center access, maybe an hour of free snorkel rental. So, all in all, I would recommend Turtle Bay, because of its beautiful North Shore location and wonderful outdoor activities, just be on notice that you may be a bit let down when the sun goes down and you have to spend some time indoors in your room and the resort restaurants and shops.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Emeryville, California", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Views, Seclusion, Pricey Food, & lots & lots of Wind\u201d", "Author": "GnometteJ", "ReviewID": "UR64772330", "Content": "I now understand why the North Shore of Oahu is the most popular surfing spot in all the world, even during the \"mild season\" the wind was blowing like crazy creating amazing waves in the ocean.

This being said, we knew we wanted to stay in the North Shore. I'm not sure why there's so many negative reviews, but again, having been to Hawaii before, I can honestly say that Turtle Bay was great! If you are more interested in staying in a commercial location, then Waikiki is definitely the place. If you want to experience the country, then definitely stay at the North Shore. It's as simple as that. You are not going to get the Hyatt or Marriott or Westin in the North Shore. Unless you are renting a house, Turtle Bay is the only place to stay and it is worth it!

I actually have a Snuggie (haha) and brought it with me and it kept me warm on the flight. Baggage Claim was easy and we went outside to wait for the Alamo Rental Car Shuttle Bus. Alama is outside of the airport, but so very close. We were able to get our car in no time. (We used Priceline for the rental car and got a standard size car for $18/day...can't beat that!). We had rented a Jeep on our honeymoon in Maui and knew that we didn't care to do that this time around. FYI, gas in Honolulu is around $3.49/gallon for Regular. Once we got our car, we were off to the North Shore! We pulled up to Turtle Bay and was so impressed that we could see the bay to the left and the hotel lobby to the right...pretty cool! It's really great to see the floor to ceiling windows and the open air lobby. You immediately relax! Check in was great, we were given room 572 (deluxe ocean view room w/king bed). There is a roof that you will be able to see from the balcony, however that did not bother us. The view of the Pacific Ocean is what we cared most about. Besides, you're not looking down when you're on the balcony, you're looking out to the ocean. We walked to the cottages and those look great too! We walked around the property and Turtle Bay keeps it pristine. They do a great job of manicuring the lawns and really keeping the resort clean. We did not see trash anywhere on the grounds of the property at all. We chose to Self Park...there is absolutely no reason to valet park unless you really want to/need to during this time of year. We never had any trouble finding a space to park in at all. Yes, the furniture is dated, but it's Hawaii!! It's not a Ritz Carlton, people. Will you be holing yourself up in the room while you're in Hawaii? We sure didn't. The room was clean, did not smell of mildew, was not musty and the air conditioner worked perfectly. Could they update the furniture and the beds? Yeah, sure. But, it's not anything to ruin a trip to Hawaii. We had absolutely no complaints about the room. The rooms have a safe and a mini-fridge. They also have ample closet space. The free wi-fi worked just fine for us. I used it to get on the internet one night. I have a Macbook, and the free wi-fi was just fine and it was fast for me. It's also a good thing they have free wi-fi because some spots in the resort/room couldn't pick up a service. Once I got on the resort's wi-fi, I was able to use my cell phone. The service was great and the staff greeted us every time they saw us. We were given complimentary champagne upon arrival as well. The elevators were fast and we barely spent any time waiting around for them. Concierge opens at 7am, so that's convenient as well. You will get towel cards at check in and that's the only thing that was iffy. You get one card per guest which equals to one towel per guest. It would be nice to have more than one towel. If you lose your towel card, I believe it's $25 - they explain this to you at check in. We did not eat at any restaurants at the hotel. We learned from our honeymoon in Maui that it is much better to eat the towns next to the resort...much better food and we really like the local flavors. Of course it costs more to eat the resort, but if you want to stay there and eat, you have to understand that you're paying for convenience (unless the food is just absolutely amazing). In Maui, we had the breakfast buffet and we chose to not do that this time around in Oahu. We went into town for breakfast instead (and loved it!). There is a grocery store on the way to Turtle Bay, called Foodland so you can stop there to get things if you need to. The bay part of the resort is great, especially around 4:30/5ish pm. This is when the local surfers come up. The winds picked up and the waves got pretty big (although obviously not as big as they are when it's Winter season from what I've read and been told). My husband and I picked a patch of grass on the resort and watched the surfers catch waves. The cove (beach) part of the resort is great too. As a resort guest, you will have someone there to give you towels and set up your chairs. The little stand at the end is where you rent your snorkel gear. The young men who set up our chairs and gave us our towels were so nice, however the lady working the stand for the snorkel gear was not that nice at all. Oh well. The pool area was nice. Be prepared to jump into some cold water, but once you get in, it definitely feels refreshing. The wait staff at the pool are definitely on top of their game - they do a great job of balancing when to leave you alone and when to ask if you need something. I read in another review that it was too windy to lay by the pool. I completely disagree. It is windy, don't get me wrong, but is the North Shore and anyone who would've done some minor research/reading about the North Shore prior to arriving would know that this is the windy side of the island. The winds were actually nice...provided some breeze from that strong sun. The winds definitely did not ruin any of the time we spent at the pool. Here are some tips: -Golf: if you're doing a twilight tee time, keep in mind that the sun will be down by 7:30pm. There should be enough time to finish, especially since the courses are not crowded at all. The pro shop has good gear, mostly updated and not stuff from years ago. -Mondays in the North Shore: absolutely awesome! Everything is lighter - traffic, restaurants, beaches. Everything starts to pick up on Wednesdays. -Haleiwa Town: we went into town pretty much every day. Such a quaint town, very charming! We ate at Haleiwa Joe's for dinner (decent, will post review), Aoki's Shaved Ice (awesome), Matsumoto Shaved Ice (awesome!), Pizza Bob's (just okay). The town pretty much gets isolated when the sun disappears, so keep that in mind. Not everything stays open until 9 or 10pm. My favorite was Ted's Bakery! The food was great every time we ate here. I even tried Spam and Eggs for breakfast and surprisingly it was good! My husband really liked the omelletes. The chocolate haupia pie was different, but we liked it! Be prepared to eat outside and sometimes share a table. You have to get your drinks first before you order at Ted's and they do take credit cards, not just cash. We also ate at Fumi's Kahuku Shrimp truck...loved it! My husband got the garlic butter shrimp and I got the spicy garlic shrimp. Make sure you have cash for the shrimp truck. There is a Pizza Hut and a Mcdonald's if you keep going down Kamehameha in Haleiwa (past the shopping centers). -We also swam with the sharks via North Shore Shark Encounters...and it was AWESOME! They dock at the boat harbor in Haleiwa. I'll be writing a review about this as well. I highly recommend it! We were originally going to go with Hawaii Shark Encounters, but ended up with North Shore Shark and we are so glad we went with them instead!! I can't rave about them enough! -We went to Waikiki for dinner one of the nights and it was easy to get to (left Turtle Bay at 3:30pm) and easy to get out of (headed back to Turtle Bay at around 8:30pm). It takes about an hour to get to Waikiki/Honolulu and you should definitely be careful on the way back when it is dark. Just take it easy and follow the speed limit! Tip: definitely follow the speed limit during the day and night because many people just cross the street, sometimes without looking and also some walk very close to the street because there are no sidewalks (it can be hard to see them) on Kamehameha Hwy to get to their cars from the different beaches all along the highway. -We also went to Hanauma Bay one day and it was absolutely worth the drive! If you leave the North Shore any earlier than 9am, you will definitely get stuck in traffic on the freeways heading to Honolulu (rush hour). We left Turtle Bay at around 9:15 and didn't reach any traffic at all. Hanauma Bay is gorgeous and the snorkeling was great too. While we didn't see an abundant amount of fish (as compared to Molokini in Maui), there are different types that make it worth while. Parking is $1 and it is $7.50/pp to get in. You have to watch a 15 minute video about Hanauma Bay (required) before you can get down to the beach. There are trams that will take you up and down the hill for $1/pp. You can rent snorkle gear and lockers as well. You cannot rent chairs, so make sure you have towels, umbrellas and whatever else you will need. Once we were done with Hanauma Bay, we went East and took pics at the scenic point (you can't miss it, it's breathtaking!). We could've driven back to Turtle Bay this way, up the windward coast, but we had other plans. We heard the windward coast was gorgeous though! Oh and also, Hanauma Bay is closed on Tuesdays. -Waialae Country Club: my husband wanted to stop by on our way back to the North Shore after spending the day at Hanauma Bay. The people in the pro shop are not that friendly, but it was great to look around. We ate at The Counter near Kahala Mall on the way out of Waialae CC and had an awesome burger! I think they may be owned by the same people who own Kua Aina Sandwich in Haleiwa because one of the people who worked at the counter was wearing a Kua Aina shirt. Could just be coincidence though, but we did hear that Kua Aina had great burgers too. -University of Hawaii: We saw the exit coming back from Waialae Country Club and decided to stop in to take a look at the campus. -Waimea Bay: beautiful! You can't rent chairs or snorkle gear. Turtles were in the bay swimming the day we went. You will see people jumping off the rock/cliff and it could be tempting to try. Check out was wonderful too. If you're coming from the mainland (continental United States), then your flight will most likely be a red eye. Our flight wasn't leaving until 7:30pm, so we were able to get late check out (at 12:30pm) and then give our bags to the bellman, who locked them in a closet. We signed up to use a \"convenience\" room at 2:45pm. We needed to get some stuff out of our bags and the bellman politely opened the closet for us and waited while we got our stuff (clothes, etc.). We were then given a key by the reception to a room on the third floor. I think it was 352 or something like that. It's just a big room with a couch, tv, desk, bathroom, balcony, etc. Basically everything in a room except a bed. Talk about convenience!! We showered and got ready to go to the airport. Because of this convenience, we were able to lay by the pool for the day and we didn't feel rushed at all. We were able to squeeze in every last minute we had left. Overall, my husband and I decided that we definitely did it right by staying at the North Shore/Turtle Bay and then travelling to Waikiki/Honolulu when we wanted. Staying in Honolulu and then travelling to the North Shore would have just been too much, especially with the traffic, plus I don't think day trips to the North Shore will give you much of a taste for what it's like. There are some great beaches all on the way to Turtle Bay (Waimea Bay, Pipeline, Sunset, etc.). If you take the time to read up on what these beaches are made of, you'll have a better understanding of what the North Shore is like for the locals, especially in Winter. Locals come to the North Shore on the weekends and we saw the traffic heading back to Honolulu from the North Shore on a late Sunday afternoon and it was brutal! Anyway, that's it for my review.

If you want to be in \"the country\" as they say, the North Shore and Turtle Bay can't be beat! The negative reviews here are NOT what you should pay attention to. Yes, EVERY resort will have somebody go through it that has a bad experience. I do not believe this is the norm with this place. From check in to check out, the service was perfect. Everybody had a smile on their face and bent over backwards to please you. We stayed in a room on the fifth floor with a small lanai that was more than enough...we weren't in our room except to sleep anyway! The grounds of the resort are fantastic...lots of trails and beaches to walk around on. Saw lots of sea life: sea turtles, monk seals, and whales. The sunrise is something we saw every day from our lanai...never got tired of that! The only negative is the restaurants are pricey, but that is to be expected. We traveled to the local towns, mainly Haleiwa, to eat most meals, but we did go to the grocery store and stocked our minifridge for breakfast and lunch, which saved a lot of money. I can't recommend Haleiwa enough...lots of good restaurants and shops there...you have to eat at Jameson's By the Sea, it's great! Also, don't miss out on the local shrimp trucks! You are only 45-60 minutes from the south side of the island, which is not bad at all. You will need to get a car anyway to get to the resort from the airport.

This resort is like ANY other resort - perfection to some and less than expected for others. If you are looking for a beautiful setting to go enjoy, unwind, explore and relax then this is it. My family of 5 (2 adults, 2 kids age 8 and 11 and 1 grandmother) had a great time this past week. Yes, the food was expensive and we did some light shopping at the Foodland market near Sunset Beach for snacks and a few drinks, but overall this was a great location. Don't miss dinner at Ola's on the beach. The prices are higher than you would originally think you would want to pay, but well worth it. The Kalua pork nachos appetizer are WONDERFUL. Went back for a quick afternoon snack at Ola's bar on the last day just to get one more shot at those nachos! We originally were put in rooms on the 2nd floor that looked out onto a roof top and had barely any ocean view. The front desk was very helpful in relocating us to other rooms (#249 and #251) when we explained our disappointment with the original rooms. Check in was a breeze, no waiting. Golf and horseback riding was easy to book and reasonably priced for a resort enviornment. Kids had fun at the pool and thoroughly enjoyed snorkeling in the shallow bay as well. There were many different kids of fish to see and they like looking at the fish guide at the beach shack that helped them identify the fish they saw. We even saw a few humuhumunukunukuapua'a (state fish of Hawaii). Having a car to explore the North shore is well worth it. We ate at Fumi's shrimp truck (5 minutes East of hotel) twice. The spicy shrimp and butter/garlic shrimp was fantastic. We also found several fun shops and good restaurants in Haleiwa (about 20 minutes West of the hotel). Breakfast burritos at Kono'a - YUM! Our family enjoys the relaxation and pampering of the resort, but also seeing some of the local small town sites as well. Had a massage in the outdoor oceanside shack. That was relaxing, but loud visitors walking by kind of ruined the moment a few times. Not the fault of the resort necessarily, but it's too bad this shack isn't a bit more isolated. The main walkway around the hotel is right next to the massage shack. My only complaints would be the somewhat crazy food prices (ex: $18 for spaghetti or $7 for a smoothie for the kids at the pool) and the lack of a full length mirror in the rooms. We have traveled to many all inclusive resorts as a family and I would have to say that this vacation was definitely more expensive overall, however, that doesn't mean we enjoyed it any less. If you go prepared to spend a little more while on vacation and don't get hung up on the prices, you will certainly enjoy this location. We'll be back sometime again in the future I'm sure!

Although the Hotwire listing did not mention that there was a resort fee (Hotwire usually mentions this), I was expecting one and it turned out to be $25 per night. The resort fee covered the self-parking, use of the safe and the wireless internet. We checked in very early in the day (around 10:30am) so we were not expecting a room to be ready but we were offered one (maybe because we had a baby in tow and the front desk clerk felt sorry for us). We ended up with an oceanview room with two queen beds and when I say oceanview, there was a view and it was spectacular. The room furnishings, carpet and bathroom were fine but probably could use updating in few years but the room itself was fairly spacious. There was a bit of a chemical smell in the bathroom on the first day of our stay. There were two vanities with sinks: one in the bathroom and one outside the bathroom.

The pool area was quite nice and our baby enjoyed the paddling pool. Overall, we were fairly pleased with the room, especially the spectacular view.

We rented a car at the Honolulu airport and drove up to Turtle Bay which only took about an hour of easy driving. Self parking is free. The hotel sits out on a spit of land, almost projecting into the ocean. From what I could see it looked like every room has a balcony and an ocean view. We rented a \"Deluxe Ocean View\" room which overlooked the main pool area and the coastline beyond, but I don't think any rooms face inland. The room was plenty big, if a little empty of furniture. But who really uses the sofa that some rooms include? The bed was big and comfortable and the balcony had two chairs and a small table which was where we spent most of our in-room time.

Had a little fridge which was also nice. Best part was waking up to the sound of the ocean every morning. We were on the sixth floor and it sounded like it was right outside our door (I'm considering that a positive, but some might disagree.) The beach is smaller than I would have expected, but the water is sheltered and makes for nice swimming. I don't think swimming on unprotected beaches is such a hot idea on the North Shore. It's rough surf, even in April. Lounge chairs were freely available to resort guests. There's a bar/restaurant right there on the beach that's excellent. It's called Ola and it was great. The pool is surprisingly small for a hotel this big and we didn't go in. There's also a bar by the pool, but it's more what you'd expect from a hotel pool-bar; good for drinks, but I wouldn't bother eating there. Their fancy restaurant \"21 Degrees North\" has a nice menu and it's a cool space, but I don't think the food quite measures up. It's close, though. And it's probably the only fine dining option on that side of the island. Good wine list, too. They were offering a five course tasting menu which I ordered because I wanted to try as many different things as possible while I was there. I can't say it was worth $75, but if it had been, say, fifty I'd have been very happy with it. So it comes close. Lastly I highly recommend the Paradise helicopter tour that departs from the hotel grounds. A forty minute tour takes you all the way down the windward coast, over the mountains to Pearl Harbor and back up the central valley. I was worried that I'd be motion sick, but it wasn't a problem. Surprisingly smooth and it's obvious that they know what they're doing. There's a longer tour available, but I can't see what else you'd want to do up there so forty seems about right. So, a big, family-friendly, golf-heavy, self-contained resort for people who want an easy get away vacation. Good but pricey dining options and a very helpful concierge staff round it out. A very different vibe from Waikiki, but I think that's the point.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate, NY", "Title": "\u201cNorth Shore Heaven!\u201d", "Author": "Darbydog6", "ReviewID": "UR62396237", "Content": "My husband and I had a fantastic time at the Turtle Bay Resort this past week.

If you are interested in Turtle Bay just let the reviews guide you. What Turtle Bay is versus what it is not. Turtle Bay is a remote hotel located on the North Shore of Hawaii. This is a part of Hawaii known for surfing and there are little small towns surrounding the hotel. You will not find any bars or nightlife in this part of Hawaii. The town pretty much shuts down at sunset. There are tons of outside activities around this part of Hawaii. We went hiking, surfing, eating, and shopping. We also stayed in one of the cottages which had an awesome view for us to look at whenever we were in our room. The cottages are also located near one of the hiking trails. I hiked these trails almost daily. Upon exploring you can take the trails to a secluded cove where I was fortunate enough to see endangered sea turtles and they had a nest for a highly endangered mink seal roped off, but I did not get to see the seal until my last day when he finally came up on shore and lounged in the sun. The views are awesome! The room was clean, the fan worked and did not rattle, and the AC cooled the room to 65 each night. The staff was very friendly and met all of our needs. We flew out at 7:30 in the evening and Turtle Bay provided us a courtesy room to come back to the hotel after check out and shower, clean up prior to heading to the airport for free. We did not eat one meal at the resort. Teds Bakery is about 5 miles outside the hotel. We drove to town each night and enjoyed meals which typically cost us from $15-$50 for the both of us. If you are planning on nightlife, partying, hanging out in your room all day/night than this is not the place for you. The rooms are in need of remodeling. But if you are more interested in what happens outside the hotel room than it is hard to find a more attractive stretch of land than Turtle Bay.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery Disappointing Family Holiday!\u201d", "Author": "alicia80", "ReviewID": "UR62204805", "Content": "We stayed in Waikiki for our first 6 nights & had a great time at the Ohana East Hotel...Highly recommended. This was our first time to Hawaii - we travel overseas with the family every year so know what to expect for our hard earned money! After lots & lots of shopping & days spent on the busy beach, we were really looking forward to heading to the North Shore for our last 6 nights for some real R&R at Turtle Bay Resort. When we arrived we were hit with a $358 USD bill for \"Taxes & Daily Service fees\" which were apparently not charged by the resort when we booked & paid 4 months earlier!! Thanks TBR... Was not happy about that little surprise...but the costs didn't stop here! Staff confirmed it was reservations error, not ours, yet we didn't even receive a simple apology or discount or anything!!!! The $25 p/day service fee is a load of crap, it's supposed to cover basic use of facilities like tea/coffee, Wi-Fi, 1hr use of snorkelling equip & tennis courts p/day, parking, gym etc. We booked a Jnr Pikake Suite to accomodate the 4 of us which worked out to be over $330 p/night so we were expecting this to be INLCUDED anyway and to have a QUALITY & LUXURIOUS stay. The room was ok, we were on the 3rd floor with lovely views & secluded from the wind! (It was a shame it was so windy the whole time as it made the beaches & pool cold to swim in). The beaches were not great to swim in anyway as they were so rocky & volcanic with choppy waves. The bathroom was pretty old, would have expected a spa bath instead of the old tiny one we had in our \"Suite\". Nothing was free in the room, there was a price tag on everything from water, coffee mugs & a stuffed animal they want you to \"adopt\" for $20 each. The in-house movie channel didn't work either. The resort seemed to be under-staffed most of the time which was annoying - especially considering the place was not even at 1/2 capacity full! The only up-side to TBR is that the food is nice & reasonably priced...although we got sick of tipping all the time as we didnt feel the service was that great and after paying so much to stay here in the first place, it really bugged us! Kids club was another disappointment, the notice on the door said open saturday nights in off-peak season from 5pm-9.30pm so the kids were really looking forward to that...when we enquired about it, we were asked if we wanted to book the kids in at the cost of $85 USD each!!! NO THANKS!!! What a rip off!!! Our 4 & 6 yr old didn't understand & were really upset about that. All in all we wouldn't recommend anyone go there as it isn't worth the money!!! Our Waikiki Hotel was much better, for 1/2 the price so if we ever return, we certainly won't be going back to TBR.

The room was spacious and clean and the staff was AMAZING. EVERYONE on staff was amazing. I've NEVER met a friendlier staff more eager to do anything we asked for. It went beyond just saying \"hello\" in the hallway. They asked how our day was, they gave suggestions for places to go and things to do on the island, and then asked us how we liked it after we did it. If we needed extra towels or pillows, we got them. Menus for the hotel restaurants, no problem. Reservations to area events, we got it, no worries. Maids, bellmen, front desk, waitresses, valets, all the same. I've stayed in Hiltons and Marriots where I didn't get this kind of attention. At the risk of naming names, Trina and Tess YOU ROCK!!! The food was expensive but ,unless you went to Honolulu for McDonalds or Jack in the Box, food was expensive everywhere on the island. I mean if you spend that much money to be in Hawaii, you shouldn't be expecting the $5.99 Buffet at Sizzler (and there was a Sizzler in Honolulu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). The fact that the hotel is on the North Shore made it even better. We spent a day in Waikiki, and it was incredibly conjested and noisy. It had lots of high rise hotels and expensive shops, and very little privacy. There were at most five or six people on the beach with us on the north shore, despite it being a public beach. At night, we had the beach to ourselves which made for romantic sunset walks and together time. For people thinking about staying here, don't read the negative reviews. and do it.

There is a bay for swimming and snorkeling, a surf break for surfers, a beach with tide pools for exploring, horse back riding, golf, tennis, jogging paths, pools, etc...I liked the large size of the grounds. It felt relaxed. The restaurants were all very good and the service was good, as well. We ate in the hotel for breakfast each morning. Usually we ate out for lunch after a snorkeling trip or surf trip in Haliewa. Teds Bakery was delicious and the bakery in Haliewa had great sandwiches, smoothies, acai bowls, etc...We ate several times at Ola on the beach at the hotel for dinner. Fresh fish and happy kids - what could be better? This trip we stayed in the hotel and had an ocean view room on the fourth floor. We had a good deal on the room and were content with it. the balcony had great views. The rooms look like they have had some minimal updating but the bathrooms really need a little TLC. The florescent lights kind of bugged me, but i didn't hang out in the bathroom too much! My husband said they should get flat screens - the old tvs really date the rooms. Our room connected to the kids, so we had our privacy, too. I think next time we will investigate the beach cottages or villas. they look wonderful! The hotel structure has a bit of a \"conference hotel\" feel in the lobby and some of the public spaces. We usually stay at the Mauna Kea on the big island, and if you have been there, you know that the lobby is beautiful and truly hawaiian in design and feel. this does not feel like that...this is open, but feels like it was made to house large groups of people.

The staff there was amazing. Immediately upon checking in we had icy fruit drinks delivered to our room along with t-shirts and fresh fruit. The fruit was replenished daily, and it was absolutely delicious. The main breakfast restaurant staff was great. By the second day they already recognized us and knew our drink orders. Everyone was very helpful, pointing us in the right direction for wherever we needed to go. Staying in the cottage was wonderful. The room was beyond beautiful, and it was very nicely located. Outside the cottages there were many open hammocks just waiting for you to lay in. All were situated to overlook the beautiful beach. The beach coming directly up to the room was not ideal for anything other than looking at, was difficult to get to and the waves were a bit aggressive, but other than that it was ideal. The walk to the calmer beach was very short and scenic. Everything you could possibly look at at the resort was absolutely breathtaking. One of the reasons we chose this resort was that it was away from Waikiki. We wanted a quiet and peaceful vacation, and Turtle Bay certainly delivered. There were very few children at the resort, and not once did we encounter a loud group to interrupt our serenity. The room was immaculate. Everything was cleaned twice daily, and the bathroom looked as if it had never been used. The tub was so big you could swim in it. Beds were comfortable, we both have tempurpedic mattresses and pillows at home, so they took a little bit of getting used to, but overall we both got great nights sleep. The food was delicious.

A beautiful bay, the North Shore, shopping nearby, grocery store, etc. The staff was polite and very responsive to our requests, needs, and desires. The hotel itself is where I have the problem. We entered our room and found a stuffed fish on the bed. Previous vacations had something like that as well as a thank-you for staying with us or something that would remind us of where we had been. Not this fish. It had a nice $20 price tag on it and a \"adopt me\" blurb. If this money were going to the WWF or a local Environmental group I would think that this would be alright, but as far as I know, the hotel just wanted to make some money. If I had 2 kids or more, I would have been out a bit of money. It continued in the room, \"The first cup of coffee is on us, if you would like more, it will be billed to your room. Please feel free to take the mugs, it will be billed to you room.\" I'm surprised that there wasn't a sticker on everything in the room and where I could buy it online. The room itself, 4th or 5th floor facing west if I recall. Pale green like this website colour. The furniture was from the 1980's or earlier and had a used rustic look. For $250+ a night, you would think that they could maybe spruce up the place. I've paid less and had much more. More pillows, newer furniture (nicer furniture that wasn't purchased at my parent's garage sale), flat screen TV's on the wall, and complimentary items like slippers, bathrobes, bottles of water, plates of cookies or fruit. Not here. So what does this money get you. Apparently I could have made use of the tennis courts, had free internet, received a newspaper daily, etc. etc. etc. According to the hotel many guests previous to me asked for such items and paid a small fee for them. So now the hotel just included it in the price of the room. Thanks, but no thank-you. I would like that Tennis court money back please. If everybody decided to go and play tennis, TB Resort would have to either build more courts, or make it a 36 hour day some how. Not once did I receive a newspaper at my door. As for the internet. That should just be standard and not an add on price. It helped plan our outings. My next little pet peeve is the parking lot. A little bit of a walk, but nothing I can't handle. It just seemed that the lot was always full and I had to park a long way away. They had sections blocked off for this and that. Thank-you's go out to the person who invented rolling luggage. If I had a problem I could have paid for Valet service. But this would just be more money that really wouldn't make my life any easier. Instead I was fighting for parking with people who just came to use the beach areas. Food is not included. Continental breakfast would have been nice. My fiancee told me that there was a coffee and breakfast place in the lobby. Looked to her that is was complimentary, but the cashier was around the corner hiding from view. That is what I heard, I did not really investigate, I have nothing to say about it. But the buffet restaurant is decent. Grab yourself the $15 mini all you can eat buffet. If you want an omelet or waffles, I don't think it is really worth the extra $5. I can stay at a Howard Johnson and get those for nothing. There was lots of fresh fruits, breads, cereal, yogurt. Good start to the day, but after doing this once, I was happy with my Egg McMuffin combo for $5.99. Once, we went to the restaurant down by the Tennis courts, via hotel Golf Cart shuttle. Nice little restaurant, good food, prices... a little steep for the shrimp considering I drove by the shrimp farm the previous day. But still good. 4.5/5 for atmosphere and quality of food and drink. The staff was very nice as well. The small bar restaurant in the hotel was quite noisy and the food is typical pub fare style all battered. Nothing surprising here. I love to play golf, wish I had, but I didn't care for it. Instead we walked about 20 minutes west of Turtle Bay to the next bay (Protection Bay???) past the WWII bunker and enjoyed swimming, seeing turtles, and conversing with other couples. Recommend people visit this beach as it is quiet, protected from the rough surf, and you are bound to see green sea-turtles. Pack the sunscreen. So, would I recommend this hotel? I don't think so. There has to be something that gives more bang for the buck around there. As for my complaints, I guess I'm just comparing this place to hotels and services that I have come to expect. This place just wants your money and more when you get there. Nice location on island for sunsets, but that is about it. P.S. be weary of the shampoo and conditioner, my girlfriend had an allergic reaction to it. And the shark cage swimming on the north shore, recommend, pretty neat experience.

The resort is peaceful and dare I say, serene. The grounds are very well kept with no litter at all to be found. Most importantly the staff were extremely courteous and quick to respond to any request. Our room was very clean and surprisingly quiet. Even with adjoining rooms occupied we never heard a sound other than the ocean waves crashing onto the beach at night. On our first night there we ate at the Bay club which is your typical hotel bar and grill with simple menu. I had a Kobe beef burger ($17) and my wife had Chicken Ceasar salad. Both dishes were good. Another night we ate ate the hotel beach side restaurant, Ola. We both had steak dishes ($34) which were prepared by the head chef and not line cooks. The steaks were done to perfection and served with the greens of the day. Meal was worth every penny. The only meals that I found to be rather expensive would be breakfast. If you like to eat well first thing in the morning then I would suggest signing on for their meal plan. For those who just need a little something, there is a coffe bar that is set up in the lobby which has coffee, tea, muffins and such. Overall the food pricing seemed within reason when considering that this is an island resort. The hotel has ample ammenities and several small shops that are in line with any establishment that bills itself as a resort. There are several miles of hiking trails that follow the coast line and reward you with gorgeous views. There are horses available at the hotel stable for rides along the beach as well. There are plenty of sitting areas along paved walking paths around the hotel itself where one can watch surfers and the setting sun. We ventured to Waikiki twice during the week we were on the island and we are so glad we didnt have accomodations there. As we are from NYC, Waikiki seemed to us like 5th avenue on a beach. Turtle bay was exactly what we were looking for - quiet, low key with subdued elegance. Be aware that the resort is located on the north shore of Oahu and far away from any night life and shopping centers. A car is a must. Make a left coming outside of the hotel grounds and after a short drive you will find some fruit stands and the famous Kahuku shrimp trucks that serve plate lunches. Make a right and you will drive past sunset beach and the legendary Banzai Pipeline surfing area. The hotel location can't be beat in my opinion. Okay, now for the negatives. Parking can be difficult as finding an open space can be hard at times. If one can't be found then valet service is available for an additional $10 fee plus tip of course. The bed matresses could be better. After reflecting on our stay there last week ( Mar 27 - Apr 4) the only other knock against the hotel would be the lack of some more cable TV channels. My wife and can't honestly think of any other negative issues worth mentioning. I know, cable TV channels, really. If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay and be away from the hustle and bustle of urban life then you should strongly consider the Turtle Bay Resort. We would most definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, peaceful, serene\u201d", "Author": "livinlg", "ReviewID": "UR60701377", "Content": "Wow is all I can say.

We ate at the poolside bar a few times and loved the burgers!! We saw a turtle swimming around the rocks just below where the pool is. And if you walk down the beach (past where the stables are), keep going you come to this quite secluded cove. In that cove were loads of turtles, i tried to go in the water and snorkle with them but it was very cloudy, it might not always be this way though so worth a look. We only stayed here for 4 nights as i thought that the other islands like Maui and Kauai would be the better ones to spend more time on.. however i really fell in love with Oahu. We also visited Waikiki and this was great fun. Everyone had said not to go there, too commercial etc but it was great for a day out. We also went to Pearl Harbour, which was very interesting.

In the 6 days we were here I only once saw a line at the counter and it was not much of a line, only 3 people long. The resort seemed to be very well staffed. We originally booked a premium oceanview room but after the first night decided to upgrade (For an additional $150 per night) to the beachfront cottage. Very glad we did!! The first room was perfectly fine and comfortable. It was clean and spacious enough. The view was pretty and of the ocean. We just felt it was a little bit on the standard side and were wanting a little more romance and luxury which we found with the cottage. The cottage was amazing. Hard wood floors, high ceilings with ceiling fan, one whole wall was a sliding glass door that looked out to our own private patio. Just beyond our patio was a very relaxing hammock (which I took a 3 hour nap in one afternoon!). The cottage bathroom was very nice. Marble floors and shower. Very deep soaking tub. We're talking really, really deep tub here. It was up to my shoulders when I was sitting in it! And the bath products were great. Coconut-pineapple fragrances that felt very Hawaiian. The cottage had 24 hour butler service. They brought different fresh fruit daily. The turn down service in the evenings was nice. They would leave coconut shortbread cookies on the pilllow and lay out the robe/slippers for me. And they would turn on the radio to soft, hawaiian music. It was lovely coming back to this at the end of the day. The staff was very genuine and friendly. Our cottage also came with a welcome basket that had bottled water, fresh fruit, Turtle Bay shirts for both of us, and this amazing, exotic tasting juice ( a blend of passionfruit, orange and guava). We ate at Bay Bar one night, enjoying pizza and beer. It had a good casual, relaxing atmosphere. Twice we ate at Palm Terrace, once for breakfast and once for dinner. All the resteraunts were a little expensive but portions were large and the flavor of the food was fantastic. I had spaghetti and meatballs ($19) and the meatballs were literally the size of tennis balls! The portions are definetly large enough to share an entree between 2 people. If you want a good but inexpensive breakfast on property, try the little area in the lobby by the coffee bar. They have fresh fruits, muffins, danishes and coffee galore, We ate there one morning for about $6 total. We had drinks at the poolside bar that were expensive but also plentiful in size and flavor. The bartender was friendly and service was fast. She even brought us free samples of a blended drink. All of our other meals were off-resort. (Ted's Bakery, Halewaia Joe's, Breakers) . Northshore is simply breathtaking. It can't be explained in pictures or in words, you just have to see it and even then you still won't believe it's real. There are hiking trails on the resort property that make for a wonderful, free activity. If you do the trails, be sure and take your camera. We did a helicopter tour that was worth every penny. Oahu is even more breathtaking from up above. We also did a shark encounter with Northshore Shark Encounters, hands down the best part of the trip! Anyway, I would highly recommend Turtle Bay to anyone! Start to finish this was the dreamy, luxurious vacation of a lifetime! If you go here, spring for the cottage-it's worth it!

It looks like 3/4 of the rooms are this type- ones with a balcony that fits two chairs. It's about what you can expect from a mid-range 3-star Marriott or Hilton... It's a 'resort' only in that they offer lots of activities (at a price). The room- for $188 a night through Pleasant Holidays not bad. Big room, not much furniture in it, not that clean, bathrooms new and pretty nice, although the lighting is bad and the shower really dark. The first room they gave us overlooked the pool and roof mainly, not exactly what we hoped. We asked to be moved and were accommodated. Still lots of rooftop but nice view east. My impression is that when you book through a consolidator like PH you are low on the totem pole, so to speak. The bed was terrible. The cottages look amazing however- worth the money for sure. The food- Pretty good, but really expensive! $25 for spagetti and meatballs. F&B is clearly where they make money- makes sense as you are a captive audience when on-site. We had lovely dinners at 21 Degrees North and Ola's. Room service was timely and good. There are many great places to grab a bite just a few miles down the road in either direction. The rest-- Nice location in the country- so much better than Wakiki!! Shrimp and produce stands, yummy Ted's Bakery nearby, pristine uncrowded beaches...Long lines at check-in and out, everything on \"Hawaii time\"...Very friendly hotel staff, except for, oddly the concierge staff...We did the kayak tour with Shaka Kayaks and it was great... Snorkel rental for one day was $28 for two of us (only 1 hour comp as part of the $25/day 'resort fee'), oh and the Wifi didn't work (also supposed to be in 'resort fee'). If we go back to Hawaii, we would probably rent a little beach house instead. Probably a better fit for more independant travelers. We received a nice follow-up email after our stay, and I find it caring and responsible that the management seems to follow TripAdvisor.

Like many families we work hard to travel to Hawaii, and deserve clean rooms, quality food, drinks and service, as well as resort experience if that's what we pay for. The rooms are just grubby. There were bird droppings all over the patio furniture, the beds are below par, and the bathrooms show that the cleaning staff doesn't really clean the rooms between visitors. The age of the resort shows in the cinder block walls and the stench of years of cigarette smoking. The views from the tower rooms are good, and the waves pound amazingly into the rocky shoreline. This part of the island is super windy, so sitting by the unheated pool is a unique experience. I can see why people have weddings here though, it is very photographic. The parking lot for guests is difficult because there are rarely open spaces available so you have to valet your car as a result. This place is very understaffed and shows in the disappointing service. Imagine walking up to the bar to order you drinks, and then they bring it out to you -- this was common at three of the bars (pool, beach, and bay club). Note: This is not a resort beyond the golf courses the grace the entrance. They list the resort amenities (which you pay $25/day) as a gym, free local calls, free incoming faxes, an \"hour\" rental of snorkel gear, a free hour/day on a tennis court, and free parking (if you can find a spot). Highlights: It's on the North Shore, the staff that checks your parking pass is nice, there are parrots by the elevators, and your $10 Mai Tai always come in a plastic cup!

We used to have a house in Kahuku, a few miles from the hotel, that we would use from time to time. It was considered the \u201ccountry\u201d, and still is. If you want the \u201ccity\u201d, don't stay here. But the \u201ccity\u201d is not the real Hawaii, at least not for me. I would not stay in or even visit Waikiki if you paid me. This hotel and its location are just great if you want relative privacy, the \u201cold\u201d or \u201creal\u201d Hawaii, beaches and coastline with relatively no one on them, views of the mountains unspoiled by high-rises, and houses with galvanized iron roofs unchanged over 50 years. If you want shopping 'till you drop and fake Hawaiian music in endless Polynesian-themed bars, then this is not the place to stay. All the nice things said about the hotel and the restaurants are basically true. We were there eight days, and found that maybe 95% or more of the time the service and quality was great, but maybe 5% of the time there was a real loser thrown in. But that may be true anywhere. When the hotel did mess up for me in a giant way, they gave us a basket of fruit and the manager apologized profusely, so they do seem to care. The kiddie pool seemed really nice for the kids, plus the beach area has basically no waves so it is entirely safe for little children to play (safe from waves), although we did not bring children. The prices in my experience, having travelled heavily in Hawaii and the world, are about normal for a resort. But the food quality is surprisingly good, and the portions are good-sized. So, for example, we always split a single lunch order by the pool so per person it was not expensive, and the quality was excellent. If you want cheap, you probably shouldn't be in a resort like this, but you can always go to the Subway and McDonald's in Laie, about 15 or so minutes south. I was impressed that in the Palm restaurant, which often has buffet dinners, they have live Hawaiian music every night, by a member of a group (Mixed Plate) or the whole group (Saturday) who are really good and sing mostly real Hawaiian songs in Hawaiian. Maybe for you this is not an issue but for my wife and I this was a big deal. It is not easy to find real Hawaiian music in a hotel \u2013 most hotels have Don Ho tourist crap music \u2013 unless you prefer Don Ho type tourist crap music.. On Friday night, the hotel provides an Hawaiian Luau entertainment/dinner package for I think a lot of money ($100?). We saw the entertainment from our balcony \u2013 it was sort of standard, tourist-type pseudo-Hawaiian entertainment with most of the songs in English, a dead giveaway that it is not the real deal. The guy doing the male Hula was terrible. The food is probably the same as that in the buffet in the Palm restaurant. My strong recommendation if you want authentic Polynesian entertainment is to go to the show at the Polynesian Cultural Center. Almost all the performers are LDS students at the BYU campus in Laie, and they are simply presenting the dances they have learned as part of their own cultures within Polynesia. It is pricey but is done really well and is worth it. The shrimp trucks \u2013 whoever thought this was a good idea? $13 for a handful of whole shrimp that you have to take the heads off of and peel yourself ? But Ted's Bakery cannot be missed. The bakery goods are huge, and quality is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. The glazed donuts were always warm and were luxurious. And their Chocolate Haupia Pie (sold in individual pieces) is really great. The Gold Standard for snorkeling in Hawaii is generally considered to be the Captain Cook Monument in Kealakekua Bay south of Kailua in the area of Kona, Hawaii, where I have snorkeled many times. I found the snorkeling in the little protected bay east of the hotel to have cloudier water due to the water movement (a no-brainer), fewer fish, but a greater variety of fish than at the monument. I saw maybe six different kinds of fish I had never seen before, and also was able to find a lobster, a turtle, and a four foot trumpet fish, none of which I expected in such an area. Of course, you can't go charging around kicking your swim fins and expect to see any fish. The resort has some kind of \u201cstandard\u201d about when it is \u201csafe\u201d to loan out snorkeling gear \u2013 when it was overcast and windy, they would not let anyone use their gear (at least two days). I brought my own mask so it did not matter, and of course the fish are not really too concerned about the weather, but you may want to bring your own mask and snorkel if you have one. I have no idea why the resort does this, since safety is always the same. The hotel has trails along the coast going both east and west from the hotel with nothing there except ocean, beach, rocks, sky, and trees. On one beach we saw a monk seal, which apparently is quite rare and very endangered, and on another a crew filming for the show Lost, which I guess is equally endangered. It is really pretty if you are into nature walks. The surf was up for several days while we were there. There were nicely formed 12-15 foot waves directly north of the hotel, and twenty foot plus waves to the east. The waves were just spectacular. At Sunset Beach (four miles west) the waves were thirty feet. We had a view of the waves and the sunset from our room. Walking out to the point just to the north of the hotel, I had a great view of the sunrise (or the sunset for that matter) over the water. We would go back to this hotel in a flash.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorktown, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat but I noticed many near misses...\u201d", "Author": "sortiz", "ReviewID": "UR57110340", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel because we are members of the 'Escape Club' and this was part of our package. Check-in was good, the staff were friendly.

My husband and I managed to check-in, walk back to our car, re-park it and walk back through reception noticing on the way back that the same couple were still waiting. Our room was roomy with a very comfortable king bed. I had read other reviews complaining about the rooms being outdated but ours was clean and maintained. Yes, the bathroom cabinets were simple and dated but I honestly don't spend much of my vacation in there to really care as long as it is clean and has everything we need. Our room had a separate vanity with a sink in an adjoining dressing room which was convenient for my husband and I to both get ready at the same time. The grounds are beautiful and we sat at the pool bar and watched the sunset. The bartender didn't seem to want to serve us so we sat at a table and received excellent service from a waitress. As we hadn't made a reservation at any of the restaurants, we went to 'The Bay' bar and got some drinks and a pizza. Again, the waitress was fantastic, so was the drinks and the pizza was big. We only stayed there one night but here is the other near miss that we nearly encountered. We noticed in the morning that right underneath our room balcony, the staff were setting up tables and chairs for a wedding reception. I would not have been happy to have had to listen to a party and would have felt intrusive if I was to sit on the balcony while the event was taking place.

We stayed here one night so that we could visit the North Shore a little longer. The hotel property is just beautiful, literally located on the edge of the ocean. The waves were so beautiful and very very loud. The pools are very nice as well, but again, not heated so they were very cold. (we have not found a heated pool in Hawaii). SERVICE: we did wait over 30 minutes to check in, as there was only one lady working the front desk. When we got to our room, we were very disappointed as we paid for \"OceanFront\" and got a view of the roof and could not even see the ocean. After two hours of trying to hear from a manager, we finally were moved to another room on the end of the hotel with a better view. The entire hotel is supposed to be oceanfront, but most of the lower floors have views of the roof, so ask for an end room, or better yet....just book the suite. We ended up there and it was very roomy and much nicer. The rooms are not as bad as what everyone says. Yes, they are older but it does have a certain charm about it. The beds were nothing to write home about as ours was not that comfortable but hearing the ocean at night made us not really care that much anyway. LAUNDRY: there are only a few coin operated machines on one of the floors. Not so clean but available for use in a pinch. FOOD: The restaurant that we had dinner at was on property (Ola). It was very good but service was slow and the wait was long for a table. We had breakfast at the Palm Terrace and ordered from the menu. It was good, as well. They also have a breakfast buffet in the mornings. In conclusion, we were glad to have visited the famous North Shore and recommend visiting the area if you are on Oahu. It is really not to be missed. We did not like the service at this hotel, but agreed that spending the night was worth it to spend more time on the North Shore.

We had an absolutely lovely time and simply cannot wait to come back. Neither one of us golfs, but I play tennis and was able to participate in a few tennis clinics and the courses do look amazing. I've made a list of Pros and Cons, so if you're traveling to Oahu these can hopefully help you make up your mind! Pros: -The pools: Quiet, calm and serene and, best of all, enough chairs for everyone unlike at other resorts! -The beaches: miles and miles of them (5 to be exact) so you can get away from the hustle and bustle. Be forewarned that the beaches are, by law, public so there are people from the general public who use them. We never once found this to be a problem. -The staff: Everyone was warm and welcoming and greeted you with an \"Aloha!\" and a smile. -Nice mini-fridge in room to keep fresh fruit, drinks, etc. Helped when we went to the grocery store to stock up! -All rooms have at least a partial oceanview, which is great! -Quiet! Even though there are families with kids here, for the most part it's adults and the kids tended to hang out in the pool with the waterslide, which was far enough away from the main pool they weren't bothersome. Cons: -As expected, all restaurants on site are extremely expensive and there really isn't a town so to speak of to go to to eat without driving. We actually went to the supermarket down the street and picked up things for breakfast and lunch to keep costs down. As much as I love a nice, hot breakfast, I can't justify paying at minimum of $20pp for it. -Must rent a car. There's really no two ways about it, renting a car is really a must. -Resort fees. I booked our room through an outside site (Orbitz) and was unaware of the resort fee that's added on daily. At the end of the day it didn't break our budget, however I wish that they either included this in the room price (and therefore just raised the room price) or had explicitly stated that it would cost another $25 a day. Instead it says parking, internet, etc. included. Well, that's the $25/day fee. -Housekeeping. Often times we felt that housekeeping was not, um, doing their jobs. I spent a summer working as a housekeeper at a 5 star hotel, so I completely understand the job. However, often times we would find trash still in the bins or beds slopily made. Not the biggest deal, but they also kept getting room numbers screwed up and knocked on our door multiple times to deliver things at bad times (6:30AM (twice in a row just to double check) and 11:00PM). Location could be a pro OR con depending on your attitude towards vacation. We both wanted to be isolated and away from everything, so Turtle Bay was perfect for us. It's about an hour to Pearl Harbor and about 90min to Waikiki. If you don't mind being out of \"the loop\" then TB is great! Overall, I would not hesitate to stay at TB again. Even with the $25/day resort fee, it was still cheaper than a similar hotel in Waikiki. The activities were great and we had an amazing time.

We had spent the first part of our trip in Waikiki and the last 3 days on North Shore. We had connecting rooms and were immediately dissapointed in the rust and mold on the door jamb between the connecting doors and some mildew in the bathrooms. The rooms are a little outdated, but fairly comfortable. If you are traveling with kids, this is NOT the place for you. The resort is at least a 15-20 minute drive from other towns so the hotel restaurants are your only choice. The one restaurant that actually had food my kids were interested in was a bar and no one under 21 was allowed. My wife and I tried to go to the hot tub later in the evening each night we were there, but every time we encountered groups of very intoxicated NON-Guests in the hot tub. From what we overheard, Turtle Bay is an easy place to sneak in to, drink at the bar, and sit around the hot tub for free. The last problem we had was with our credit cards.

The pool was closed for our stay for a makeover, but they warned guests on their website so we knew they were offering a free buffet breakfast each day in exchange for the inconvenience (the pool area looked great). The North Shore was also experiencing 30-50ft waves which were the biggest waves in 50 years or so we were told. The other islands were experiencing these as well when we were there. So, yes, the beaches were closed to the public all over the North Shore for 2 or 3 days. We found non-swimming activities to pass the time and still had a great time. The hotel itself looks amazing from the outside, but the rooms are dated and need a makeover too \u2013 although they are big, and we had no complaints about the bed, better than the Marriot Waikiki where we stayed the second half of the trip. Every staff member was especially friendly. We booked on a discount site so we got the room for a good price & we thought the breakfast food tasted great. We never ate there for dinner \u2013 went to Honolulu (45mins 1way) or Haleiwa (15mins 1way) for dinner. On the North Shore there are lots of nice beaches and the Waimea waterfalls (which were a lot of fun to swim in, but cold! & don\u2019t try to go behind the waterfall \u2013 we got a little banged up, still a lot of fun). If you\u2019re a Lost fan you\u2019re going to love this hotel, they were filming there everyday we were there and we met some of the cast & crew. It was an experience of a lifetime, the cast & crew were so friendly, we got lots of pictures and we were even allowed onto a closed set by the banyon tree (which is worth the hike in itself). If you follow Lost you\u2019ve got to visit the hotel before April when they said they were done shooting. We also met the Liaison young woman between the Lost crew & the hotel and she was very nice as well. A BIG thank you to all of the Lost crew & cast who gave us a behind the scenes look at the show it was the best anniversary gift we could have received. They were filming in the hotel as well and we got some pictures with actors there as well, everyone was so nice and they allowed us to watch from out of camera range. If you don\u2019t follow the show I can see it being somewhat of a nuisance if they\u2019re filming on the same floor as you, but we changed rooms because of pool construction noise so I\u2019m sure you can do the same. In the end, the North Shore is much different than the Vegas like Waikiki area and there is lots to do in Oahu which is all worth visiting. Although, Waikiki isn\u2019t our idea of Hawaii being lush secluded islands, with beautiful beaches and scenery and the North Shore as nice as it is \u2013 it\u2019s probably better to stay in Maui or Kauai if you\u2019re looking for that type of vacation. (We\u2019ve been to Maui, the Big Island, and Oahu\u2026 Kauai is next!) But you should go to Oahu at least once to see all the attractions and the North Shore is great place to get some quiet time in\u2026 and Turtle Bay is the only resort up north, so, it\u2019s the place to stay if you\u2019re there & if you love Lost then go for sure!", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "jmfitz", "ReviewID": "UR52940901", "Content": "We stayed here with our teenagers and everyone had a great time!

We would definitely go back. They were filming \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" when we were there so there was alot of painting, movie fliming, etc but the hotel was very good about accomodating any troubles that came from the filming. Everyone was very friendly. If your looking to party, this is not the place for you. Everything closes by 10pm on this side of the island, even restaurants. Its about 45 minute drive to Waikiki so it's not very practical to drive there for night life when you have such a long drive back after. Also the drive to Waikiki has a lot of traffic so you could easily take 1 1/2 hours or longer to get there. This hotel has more of the relaxing, island feel to it. Waikiki is way more \"touristy.\" I have no complaints whatsoever.

Well, those who indicated that the service was poor to very poor here are absolutely correct. For the type of resort that Turtle Bay claims to be and charge, they should be embarrased by their service. Everything from missed reservations (twice - and for those who have stayed here you know that there are not many other choices in the near vicinity), to cancelled spa appointments, waiting for dinner over an hour on 2 separate occassions, never a good breakfast experience, and just plain waiting at pool side......and on a couple of occassions, never receiving a drink order from poolside bar. At one point while sitting at the pool bar for about 30 minutes I noticed that not only I was getting a bit impatient but others around me were waiting and complaining as well. Finally, I wondered whether service would be better if I called from my cell phone. They indicated on the phone that they would be right out and I thought I was on the brink of getting a drink but alas the people behind me who were complaining receieved their order and then the attendant went right by me to the new people who had arrived and stated that since \"I did not have a menu\" she skipped me. Now I get it as I am typically the one reading these reviews and thinking \"well why don't you get up to the bar and order yourself.\"...it becomes the principle of staying at this type of resort that states that they provide pool side service that you would then like to get served a drink at pool side. There are so many more examples and that said I still have tried to take the perspective of taking a deep breath and remember that I am relaxing but really, really the service is just horrible and it is hard to relax when you are always waiting and having to do so much work while on vacation to ensure that your reservation has been made, the activities have been scheduled, etc. Now,Jayde who serves smiles, laughs and great drinks at Hang Ten Bar is a delight. the hotel needs more like her. Perhaps there is not enough staff and if that's the case I really encourage Turtle Bay to hire more people as this is not at all in the same league as other resorts that they indicate they are competing with - Service is similar to ---- a low end hotel much less a resort.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Coast", "Title": "\u201cIt would be nice for a short - not long - stay\u201d", "Author": "EastCoastRiva", "ReviewID": "UR52203687", "Content": "Just returned from Turtle Bay. Pros: There are some pretty good things about this place. The location is very pretty and allows you access to several scenic points where you can watch the waves and surfers. It is in close proximity to Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach, and we went to breakfast in Haleiwa (at Cafe Haleiwa, which was a nice, very informal spot). I think it would be nice to maybe spend two or three nights there as a base to explore the North Shore. Cons: I personally would not spend more than a few nights here again (we stayed seven). While the setting is beautiful, the resort is large and sticks out against the landscape, which detracted from the scenic environment. Although they advertise miles of coastline, most of it is not really where you would swim. They have two \"swimming beaches\" -- one of which is rather small and packed (at least in December), and the second of which is a 20-30 minute hike away and is pretty disconnected from the resort (no services there, so you have to haul your towels etc. out there). This is not the type of place where someone will bring you a drink on the beach, or even set up your beach chairs/towels. I did not find it very relaxing, but I am used to more isolated spots where I can just lie on the beach without interruption. This is a very family friendly place, which is great for families, but you should just be aware of that before planning a trip (I learned first hand after being hit with a volleyball because I was on a beach chair in the proximity of the beach volleyball set up). So, I would say this is more of a family place than a romantic getaway. Also, they are a little odd about towels -- they ration them out (it appears that they will give you one towel per person, which I don't like because I like to use one towel to lie on and another to dry off with) and you need towel cards to get the towels. It just seems kind of strange. I would also not categorize this as a luxury hotel. It is more like your run of the mill Hilton or similar chain, just placed in a beautiful setting. The bathrooms were not great and they don't give you bathrobes unless you ask (how odd is that?). When you do get a bathrobe, it is not the typical terrycloth robe -- it is a short thin robe that kind of reminded me of what you wear in hair salon. There is no minibar. The service was also on par with an average hotel chain. When we tried to get suggestions of things to do from the concierge, we didn't really get much help except to point us to the brochures directly across from the counter. I am used to having more proactive and helpful concierge experiences. Again, this wasn't horrible, but it just average. If you want to take a hike on the trails, I would recommend some closed toe shoes. On my hike to the second swimming beach, I learned that this was also a horse trail which means horse poop. I was wearing sandals, which was not the perfect choice! The food was pretty average and very expensive for what it was. I was underwhelmed with Ola, which was pretty bland. Finally, I would recommend getting a Premium room versus a Deluxe room. We paid in advance through a travel website and opted for the Deluxe room, which was more expensive, because it was supposed to have a bigger lanai. When we got there, our Deluxe Oceanfront room overlooked the ballroom first -- you could not see the shoreline and had to look over the ballroom to see the ocean. I was really disappointed in this, and we asked the front desk if we could move. They said yes and we moved to a Premium Oceanfront room, which had a beautiful view and no buildings in the way. This was a cheaper room, and we asked if we could have a refund of the difference in the price. We were refused, and told that we were \"voluntarily downgrading.\" That experience was unpleasant and a bit insulting because our first room really was overlooking a ballroom and then, in the distance, the ocean. We asked the front desk about this twice, but they were firm. Note that we did not go to management so I do not know what would have happened if we did - we were kind of tired and didn't really want to get into it any further. Nonetheless, I would not characterize what we did as a \"voluntary\" downgrade.

Some baseboards were chipped and not touched up. Doors didn't always open easily. Bathrooms had beautiful marble tiles and counters but cabinetry just looked basic and painted white. Wonderfully quiet at night but the beds were not incredibly comfortable. Lots of space in each room but my suite had what seemed like a wasted walkthrough area.

It's unfortunate when you have taken part in most of what the resort has to offer and you would like to try something else but would prefer to not rent a vehicle.

The snorkelling is fun and included for one hour per day in your resort fee. Some people even got to see turtles in the mornings!

Our room was very large, and had a huge completely private lanai/balcony with 2 chairs, table, a nice chaise lounge, and still a lot of space . The view was great, we were on the 4th floor and directly on the ocean. The room furnishings were nothing fancy, but very nice, king sized bed, full couch, 2 armchairs, nice dining table with 4 chairs, desk and chair, good quality TV with lots of channels, also a safe and good sized fridge. When we were there they were in the process of replacing the carpets in the hallways, which were a bit worn. The resort dining was mixed. Our first night we just wanted something quick so went to the Bay Club, advertised as a \"sports bar\". It was truly awful - bad atmosphere, cheap decor, and $18 for a frozen pizza that was really terrible. The pool bar was average, could use some updating. It was very windy the whole 6 days we were there, drinks would blow over unless we sat in a few seats at the bar that were protected. We really liked Ola, the bar/restaurant on the beach side of the hotel - good food and drinks, nice atmosphere and decent service, went there several times. The \"Turtle's Den\" in the lobby was great - a cart serving simple breakfast and lunch items to go, very reasonable prices. Overall the food/beverage costs were similar to other resorts we've stayed at, we didn't find them outrageous. Off-site, we loved Ted's Bakery, 3 miles from the resort, really good breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts. We also liked Joe's in Haliewa, about 20 minutes away. We did not try any resort activities, spent most of the time touring around the area or on the resort beach. We had our own snorkels but the water was very cloudy in the whole area, probably the time of year as seas were very rough.

The maid accidentally took my beach towel thinking it was a hotel towel. When we called to ask about it, they searched through all the hotel laundry until they found it, then returned it to our suite washed, dried and wrapped. We thought this was very good service.

The location and the views from the property out on the ocean are really one of a kind. As for the overall resort, it is very very tired. Some money has clearly been spent on the lobby, but that seems to be the extent of renovations. For example, there are numerous tennis courts, but probably less than half are actually in good enough condition to play tennis on. Maybe two of the courts are in excellent condition, with the remainder exhibiting typical signs of neglect (lots of cracks and uneven surfaces). The pool area leaves a lot to be desired and looks like it was constructed in the 1980s, no swim up pool bar, tired pool deck. That being said, the scenery from the pool area (breaking waves etc) is very nice. Also, there are no resort organized activities such as surfing, dancing, etc. We stayed in one of the beach cottage which was very nice and I highly highly recommend booking this accomodation. The rooms are large, the beds are very comforatable, bathrooms have been updated (and large), have a shower stall and a seperate large tub and there is a small seating area in each cottage. The cottages are right on \"turtle bay\" which does not have a beach, but the views from the cottage porches are outstanding. Furthermore the cottages are exceptionally private considering you are on a large resort. Definately stay in a cottage. I did not see the rooms in the main resort building, but given the overall state of the resort (tennis courts and pool) it wouldn't surprise me if the rooms are a bit outdated. While at Turtle Bay for a week, we spend the vast majority of our time away from the resort exploring the island, returning to our cottage at night to relax and sleep. There was really nothing at Turtle Bay to keep me on resort - the pool area is old and not appealing and tennis courts are in tough shape. There are two golf course which I didnot play and horse back riding is available. We ate in the onsite steakhouse, which has nice views, but looks like something from the movie \"Wall St\" and is very very expensive for the quality (i am comparing this to steakhouses I eat in here in NYC). Overall, I would suggest this resort to someone who wants a gorgeous location in the country side of Oahu. I would warn them that they will need to turn a \"blind eye\" to the fact that substantial dollars need to be spent to upgrade the resort to its full potential and that they should seek entertainment and food off resort. If you want a drink late night, good luck. There is a lobby bar, but it is not open late. Turtle Bay is not a \"party place\", it is a quiet, very relaxed, secluded resort. While we were there in March, the number of guests seemed to be pretty low. I live on the east coast (NYC) and for my money and time there are many many other warm weather places that I would rather visit than Turtle Bay - that being said I enjoyed my time sleeping and lounging in the cottage, but spent my entire days away from the resort exploring the best the Oahu has to offer.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin, tx", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service and breathtaking views!\u201d", "Author": "jenniferAustin_Tx", "ReviewID": "UR49224364", "Content": "My husband and I honeymooned at Turtle Bay Resort and were very happy with the resort in all. Here are the Pros: They upgraded us upon finding out it's our honeymoon and I can guarantee we aren't their first honeymooner rodeo. They comped a main dish because in their opinion it took to long to get out to us, without us even complaining. There is a very wide variety of buffet to dine at every morning and has an ocean front view. The rooms all look over the ocean, at least they seem to, and we have experienced views from magnificent sun rise to a beautiful rainbow. The service is really great and everyone is very friendly, which goes a long way with my husband and I. Cons: The rooms are nice, but a little outdated. Marble bathroom floors are great, but bath tubs are normal and specifically, ours does not allow us to bathe, just shower. These are very minor, but something to know that comes with the package. They come and clean twice a day and it is all very clean! Another thing to consider about the location is the North shore. We have really enjoyed being completely isolated from most of the tourism, and there is a great variety of restaurants here in the resort and the town Haliewa within a 15 minute drive that offers shops, beach fronts and several great places to eat, but it is a solid hour from Honolulu and Waikiki (with some traffic). So, it is just good to be sure that you want the isolation feel vs walking to a lot of different places in Honolulu. The beaches and views here are great and we have really enjoyed being on this side of the island and taking day trips to Honolulu, but the driving has gotten a little much at night. Hope this helps!!

Did lots of research and planning, including a visit to the grounds and restaurants of Turtle Bay last year. While the location and grounds of this resort are outstanding, the rooms in the main hotel are just plain awful. The staff tried their best and actually moved us 4 times - each time the room had the same musty smell, beat up furniture, worn carpets, bathrooms that looked like they hadn't been updated since the late 70s or early 80s (I'm talking green tubs with old metal soap dishes), and old TVs (although a previous reviewer claims he had a flat screen - not so in the 4 rooms we viewed). The a/c vents were covered in rust and dirt. I wouldn't say that the rooms were dirty - just totally outdated with furniture, carpet and window shutters that were old and worn. Each room we saw was a king ocean-view deluxe and although they overlooked the ocean, they also overlooked the flat brown roofs of the restaurants or lobby. I've read that a lot of money was pumped into this place, but it certainly did NOT go into renovating the guest rooms in the main hotel. After viewing the 4th room we asked to speak to a manager. We expressed our concerns to him and he didn't seem terribly surprised. He told us an option would be to move to the more expensive beach cottages, and when he heard this was a trip we had planned for months and that it was our anniversary he charged us an extra $50 per night, instead of the going rate which would have been an extra $175 per night. The beach cottages were outstanding - huge, with modern marble bathrooms, flat screen TVs and patios with perfect unobstructed views of the ocean. Even if we hadn't been given a discounted rate at the cottages we would have moved anyway as we were miserable in the main building. All that being said, the staff was excellent, the golf courses were beautiful, the spa was wonderful. We enjoyed the beach, pool, bike rentals and restaurants. If you want to visit and stay at the North Shore this is pretty much your only option and while the grounds and facilities are beautiful, I would never consider staying in the hotel again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I don't understand the mentality of \"we don't spend that much time in our room, so we'll just deal with it.\" When you stay at a \"resort\" you want all the amenities and luxuries associated with one and Turtle Bay Resort truly misses the mark. Opt for the cottages or the newer villas, otherwise get an early start and drive out there for the day.

After spending 9 months reading this and other review sites, we felt compelled to send our impressions of the resort. To begin with, as a traveler that spends over 80 days per year in hotels, the hotel is as clean and well kept as any I stay in. If you are familiar with the wear and tear that proximity to salt water can do to paint and carpets, not to mention that fact that beach resort visitors tend to add sand and grit to the carpets and furnishings, the staff at TB do an awesome job of maintaining the carpet, furnishings and paint throughout the facility. Yes, they do have flat screen TV's. Yes, they offer 30 or more channels of variety entertainment, (if you happened to get a sunburn and must stay in). All of the amenities are first class, from the six on-property eating establishments, to the Spa Luana, to the exercise opportunites, to the beach-side towel and snorkeling equipment. We were greeted by name in the restaurant for breakfast, as well as when we picked up our car from the valet. We were told by the reservations agent, and reminded in our paperwork about the Resort Fee, and simply considered it as part of the cost of staying at such a great facility. The internet, while a bit slow at times, was more than adequate to allow me to check in with my office once a day. And the in-room amenities from Spa Luana were fabulous. We ate at four of the six places on the property that serve food, and found all of them to be a wonderful experience. Yes, they were much higher priced than Pizza Hut or McDonald's, but having stayed at hotels in Chicago and Las Vegas recently, the menu prices were slightly lower than I found in those two facilities. The food quality was far better than any hotel I have stayed in recently. And the service was friendly and generally excellent, (as long as you didn't treat the staff as servants, which we saw some folks doing). Things to plan on while you visit, if you don't want to buck the traffic and drive to Honolulu: Definitely do the Luau and show at the Polynesian Cultural Center. Try the ATV's at Kualoa Ranch. Have lunch at one of the shrimp trucks! Take a break and have some dinner in Haleiwa,,,Cholo's or Haleiwa Joe's were both great. Snorkle in the bay. Get a couples massage by the waves. And did I mention to have lunch at one of the shrimp trucks? My wife and I have stayed in the best hotels in Las Vegas, Chicago, San Diego, Myrtle Beach, and all over Florida.

Most people say that the rooms are dated, and yes they are a bit on the dated side, but why are people being soo picky about little things in the room when you are in Hawaii. If your not showering or sleeping why are you even in the room??? The grounds of the resort are just beautiful. It was really fun walking around and recognizing spots of the resort from \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\". Although they rearranged a lot of stuff in the movie, you could still tell. The beach was never really crowded, and you should take advantage of the one hour of snorkeling each day that is included with your $20 resort fee. I thought the pool area was really cool at the resort. there a a couple different pools with a water slide and waterfall. there are also a couple hot tubs. I agree the food prices at the resort are on the high side. The breakfast buffet at Palm terrace was awesome. Some mornings I even just got the continental buffet because their pastries were soo good. We had lunch and dinner a couple times at Lei lei's which was great.

There was a little bit of road work at the entry of the resort but it wasn't an issue. The only disappointment was that we did not get leis on arrival, we had assumed that all resorts did this. The staff was very helpful arranging our connecting rooms so we all settled in really quickly and was by the pool within 10 mins. Oh and for those that do not know this, Turtle Bay Resort was the resort featured in the movie \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" and is as beautiful as depicted in the movie. The food was fantastic on resort (can be a little pricey) and there are plenty of little 'shacks' a short drive away that sell cheap meals that even the locals go to (this is a good way to tell if its a good place or not). Even locals book into Turtle Bay Resort for a short break away. The kids did a free scuba lesson in the resort pool, we had free use of snorkel equip and there are 2 world class golf courses, horses and even a helicopter on site that you can book. Oh there's even pushbikes, mopeds and segway that you can hire for an hour or day to take a look around. Or you could book in to have a private surfing lesson. We spent a week here then went to Waikiki for a few days before we went home. I assumed that the kids being older would have been bored at Turtle Bay and would want the nightlife etc of Waikiki. But after 1 day in Waikiki they were asking to return to Turtle Bay as it was \"heaps better\". Annie at Palm Terrace restaurant in Turtle Bay made us feel at home and gave us tips on where to go and what to see, she made each one of us feel like we were part of the family.

Although this is my first review on Turtle Bay, we have stayed there every year for about 5 years. Turtle Bay Resort offers something that no other resort on Oahu can offer \u2013 a beautiful, unspoiled view of the ocean on the north shore of the island from every room! The lobby is large with a open, Hawaiian feeling. While my husband and I check-in, my children usually go to visit the beautiful macaw parrots further down the lobby by the elevators. If you\u2019re from out-of-state, they\u2019ll generally give you a pretty kakui nut lei when you register. Each room we\u2019ve stayed in over the year has been nice. This year was especially nice since we were upgraded to a cottage. We\u2019ve stayed in the cottages twice now and thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Our cottage had 2 queen-sized beds, hardwood floors (except for the bathroom), flat screen TV, and a sunken area with a table, small refrigerator, and mini bar. The large bathroom has lovely white and gray granite tile and a large, jetted tub. My daughter and I enjoyed some quality time with a Mother-Daughter bubble bath last time we stayed in a cottage. My personal pleasure is the hammock in the backyard overlooking the ocean. I thoroughly enjoyed lounging and reading my magazines in the hammock while my husband played golf and my children (on the swim team) played on the water slide. There\u2019s something for everyone. They even offer horseback riding. Over the years, we\u2019ve also eaten at all their restaurants more than once. Without a doubt, our favorite is Twenty-One Degree North. It\u2019s 5-star dining, but has never disappointed us in food or service. Although they don\u2019t have a kids\u2019 menu, they happily split an adult meal for my children. My son & I love their creamy tomato soup! The servers have always been very gracious to my children and even make them chocolate milk (I don\u2019t give my children soda.). The Palm Terrace is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We\u2019ve eaten all three meals with them over the years. They have a good breakfast buffet and menu to order from. Lately, though, we tend to get breakfast in the lobby area at the Turtle Den. They have several different coffee and teas to choose from, as well as hot chocolate, milk, and juices. I really like their coconut macadamia herbal tea. My kids love their hot chocolate with whipped cream. In addition to drinks, there\u2019s a selection of muffins, pastries, bananas, apples, yogurts, nuts, and cereal. It\u2019s Starbuck\u2019s style where you pick out your items and pay at the counter. We then sit on the comfy couches and chairs surrounding the large square tables overlooking the ocean. As for lunch, we always eat lunch down by the pool (unless we\u2019re golfing), though the food comes from the Palm Terrace. It\u2019s pricey, $13 - $17 for a salad, sandwich or burger, but it\u2019s good and you\u2019re by the pool overlooking the ocean. The buffet dinner at the Palm Terrace is your most cost effective option. The Saturday of Father\u2019s Day weekend, we enjoyed their buffet dinner. They had a large selection and the food was very good. This time, we ate at Ola\u2019s on the beach for dinner. It has a nice menu and our food was very good, again, with a view of the ocean (Are you seeing a trend here?). My husband had steak and shrimp and I had the sea bass; expect to pay about $100/couple with drinks. My children opted for room service (pizza, milk, and lava cake) and movies.

The rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. The maid staff was great. They left us coconut macaroons every evening. I am a stickler for a clean bathroom and they did a great job! The hotel staff was very nice. We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel till we were about to pop! WE just loved everything about this place. Oh...the Luau was great too! It was not crowded, relaxing, beautiful grounds and surrounding area. I would highly recommend staying here.

We spent the first half of our trip at Turtle Bay and loved every part of it. We arrived quite late in the evening but the front desk staff was very helpful and assisted us in getting everything taken care of right away. One thing that I was surprised about when we checked in was the reserve that they place on your credit card when you check in. That is, they said they would place a pre-authorization on our credit card of around $150 a day, in case we charged any activities or such to our room. While this was surprising, I have since found that it is common practice at all of the hotels we stayed at. While they said they would make this authorization, I never saw it hit my credit card so it did not cause any trouble. Either way, I will make sure to find out about these pre-authorization charges at any hotel I choose to visit in the future to make sure that I do not run into trouble. My wife and I decided to stay in one of the ocean front cottages and we are very happy that we did. The cottages are not stand-alone but are 3-5 rooms connected together. We were lucky to get an end room with no one in the room next to us for most of the stay. This provided us with what felt like a very isolated room. We were never bothered by noise of other people or their televisions. The cottages open up to a small lawn and the ocean and beach sit right behind this lawn. We even had a hammock right outside of our room. This area was a great place to take morning breakfast or to take a nap during the day. It was a very relaxing room. The room itself was very exquisite. The floors were all wood and the beds were large canopy beds. We originally reserved a room with one king bed in it but instead were provided with a room with two queen beds. When I asked about this at the front desk they told me that the king rooms were all taken but I could choose to move later if I wanted. After the first day though, we did not mind at all. The queen beds were great and we felt the room layout worked better and provided more room to spread out in as well. Every night, usually while we were out at dinner, there was turndown service and some sort of \"treat\" would be left on our pillows. These were either cookies, or chocolates and were a great surprise to come back to every night. During the day, fresh fruit and ice would be placed in our room which served as another great thing to look forward to coming back too. During our stay we received apples, oranges, cherries, and even bananas I think. The service was out of this world. The other offerings at the resort made the trip well worth it as well, even if you did not choose to get the ocean front cottages. The pool area was amazing. It was usually quite with mainly adults hanging around the pool catching some sun and relaxing in the pool. There is a bar area right by the pool and the waitresses will often walk up to you and ask if there is anything they can get you. We found the food to be decent snack food. I think we ordered smoothies and fries one day and a smoothie another day. The order of fries was around $4 or so and the smoothie was probably about the same if not a little bit more. I did not think this was too outrageous compared to the cost of such things at most restaurants or bars. We watched the sunset a few nights from next to the pool and it made a great view. Also, on Thursday night I think, a group from the Polynesian cultural center came and gave a demonstration of the different dances that are performed at the cultural center. This was great because we had been debating about going to the cultural center and just never got around to doing it. It was like a mini luau without the hefty price. The beach areas around the resort were wonderful as well. On one side of the resort is the cove that is used for snorkeling. We woke up early our first morning there due to jet lag at around 4-5am. We decided to take a stroll out and made it out to the tip of the cove just in time to see the sunset. Later in the week we took advantage of the free snorkeling gear that was provided with the \"resort fee\". You are allowed 1 hour per person free each day. We spent our hour out looking at all the fun fish and were forced inside right at the end due to a storm that was rolling in. I was surprised at the quality of the snorkeling since it was calm water and a large variety of different fish that we got to see. We only used the snorkeling gear one day but wished we had gone a few more times. As for food we never ate a full meal at the resort. The only thing we at the resort were the snacks by the pool and then one night after dinner we came back to the resort and enjoyed a great dessert at 21 degrees North. We were able to get a table right next to the windows as it was around 8-9pm and the restaurant was not that busy. For our other meals we drove to nearby restaurants and shrimp shacks. The best meal we had would be the one we got at Blue Water Shrimp & Seafood Co. It is a large blue bus about a mile or two up the road and had the best shrimp ever! We even felt it was better than the much talked about Giovanni's Shrimp. The people there were very friendly and the food was amazing. They also cooked up steaks there which smelled really good. Other restaurants in nearby towns provided great food as well. We also drove the local grocery store and picked up different food items there. This saved us a bunch of money over eating large meals at the big fancy restaurants. There was also a great place right up the road that served amazing breakfast and other baked goods. I think it was just called Ted's bakery. The only other place that I can remember was a little side of the road produce shack. They always had amazingly fresh fruit and steak cooked up on sticks. This little shack was extremely simple but was one of the best things we remember about our stay. It was the epitome of simple living. We stopped by every day and got things like grilled corn, pineapple, iced coconuts with a straw and mangos. A great way to pick up food for breakfast. After we left Turtle Bay we headed down to Honolulu and after our first night there we called Turtle Bay back to try and get any sort of room but it was Memorial Weekend and they were completely booked. The next time we go back we are spending most of our time back at Turtle Bay.

It was nice to see a new part of paradise, but it was a bit remote for my tastes. Don't get me wrong, I loved unplugging at a previous stay in Hana, but at least in Hana there were some options for good food. The Turtle Bay resort is really nice - with excellent views from all of the rooms. Word of warning - most second floor rooms have no balconies, which is a shame because it's really nice taking in the views from your room - and it seems really odd that balconies weren't built for these rooms. The beach area and the pool area at the resort are great - my only complaint is that there weren't a lot of shade options. The trails surrounding the hotel offer some good walks - and anyone into tennis, golf, surfing, or horse back riding will be pleased. The lobby and common areas (aside from the pool area) are uninspired and don't encourage lingering and relaxing. Hammocks can only be found near the higher priced cottage lodging. Towels for the pool and beach area require that you submit a towel card. One card for one towel. If you'd like more, you'll have to argue with an employee who will sternly remind you that if you lose or misplace a card you will incur a hotel charge. The big downfall of the resort is food and drink. The mixed drinks at all of the hotel locations were weak. I'm a total lightweight when it comes to alcohol and none of the drinks affected me - so they were really weak. Food was expensive and mediocre. The wait staff is also under-trained. At one point the hostess at the beachfront restaurant sat us down and shook my hand during some chit-chat. (Where did I put that Purell?). While we didn't eat at the very high end restaurant at the property (because, really, who wants to pay $50+ for a steak?) - the best of the rest was LeiLei's at the golfing range. LeiLei's is a short walk from the lobby - though there seemed to be no direct path - as such we were forced to walk on the main drive and look out for cars. Am I glad I visited? Yes. Will I come back again? Probably not.

When we arrived, they didn't have our room available (4:30pm) and that we would have to settle for a room with 2 queen beds. Upon entering the room, it was obvious that they didn't want to give us the room we booked because we were paying a low rate as an escape club member. First off, they put us on the 2nd floor looking at the trees and the ocean was barely visible. They missed the Champagned that they had promised, and the bathroom was really outdated.

The pool with the slide was closed both days we were there due to bacteria in the water which was a bit of a disappointment. The water temp in that pool did feel warmer when I put my foor in. We had two very good dinners at the on property restaurnat called Lei Lei's which is a short golf cart shuttle or car park away. All in all I'd say we were pleased with our stay and would likely stay there again, especially if we wanted to base ourselves in the north shore for a few nights. Is it a five star resort - no way. In fact, I think that one's experience of this hotel has to do with their expectation and also what price they pay for their room (which can obviously influence one's expectation). IAs I had read many of the TA reviews before booking, I kind of knew what to \"expect\". If I could have given the hotel review a 3.5 rating I would have. One final note: I have no idea if this was typical or just by chance but we did find that the weather around the resort (it juts out at a point) to be cloudier than when we left the areas and drove tem minutes away in either direction. It also seems that in general or on average, that you will liklely experience more sunshine in Waikiki than up here so you may want to keep that in mind when planning a vacation.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThe most beautiful hotel we have stayed in...\u201d", "Author": "mikejforte", "ReviewID": "UR40064143", "Content": "First thing, do not read the negative comments about mold and an unfriendly staff.

I LOVED driving into the lobby where they whisked away our car to valet parking. We had a deluxe ocean front room that had a spacious lanai overlooking the ocean/bay. Room was beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, windows were being washed as we checked in with an apology from the window washer that it wasn't finished before we entered the room. Spacious dressing room with sink and closets that were separate from the bathroom. Fresh big soft towels every day. The friendliest housekeeping people we've ever encountered...up and down every hallway. Golf courses are every bit as good as they say they are. Spacious as well as some challenging holes. Beautiful scenery with every hole. Golf clinics every day with the pro's on sharpening your skills are just starting to learn to play. Food was good in every restaurant on the property. 21 Degrees North was elegant and beautifully presented dishes. Food was prepared to perfection. We had the Chef's 5 Course Dinner and portions were perfect to be able to finish the entire dinner. Lei Lei's at the Golf Course was casual and equally as good. Everything fresh and well presented. The beach side restaurant Ole was a wonderful ocean side experience. The menu is far from ordinary and again... everything fresh. Lunch was a beautiful setting with the waves breaking in front in the bay. Service in every restaurant was excellent. There was a non denominational church service at the small out building next to the water on Sunday. What a setting to appreciate God's creation and be blessed by the local Pastor;s sermon. Exploring the surrounding area from the resort.. don't miss eating lunch at one of the Shrimp Trucks, don't miss going to Ted's Bakery and eat everything on their menu, The small town of Halewa at the marina is a great walking/shopping/souvenier experience. Have ice cream at the only ice cream shop on the North Shore in the middle of town. And of course you shouldn't miss the Poloynisian Cultural Center right down the road... a whole day of expert entertainment that everyone that is interested in the South Pacific culture shouldn't miss. Plan to be there when they open so you don't miss any of the programs presented. It was the best Luau food we have ever eaten and the big show was amazing it was so well done!

We spent 5 nights in Oahu at the Turtle Bay Resort and from a hotel stand point it was nice. It's nice that most of the resort is ocean front and this may sound silly but it was great actually staying a place without having to worry about cockroaches or ants - can't get that at the beaches in Georgia that I have stayed at. The grounds were really nice and we loved the view of our room. We loved falling asleep to the sound of the ocean. As I stated, we were on our honeymoon, and we arrived to find that we got exactly what we ordered - a partial lanai oceanfront king bedroom. I guess I can't complain, but it would've been nice to have been upgraded. But if there weren't any rooms available, then I understand. It still would've been nice had they done something, like have some lays available or flower petals or something. But unfortunately there wasn't any \"congratulations\" gift. Not a big deal, just would've been nice, that is all. I was really debating between giving this place a 3 star or 4 star and was going to give a 4 star until we traveled to the Mauna Lani Bay on the Big Island and that place had 5 star written all over it, so I thought it would be an insult to the Mauna Lani to give this place a 4 star. The main reason would probably be because of the dining on the resort. The food at this place is just NOT GOOD. We ate the first night at OLA house and the presentation was nice and it was nice eating on the beach. I think my tuna may have been slightly over cooked, but the meal was good for resort food. Little did I know that the rest of the food we would order there would be much worse. We ate the seafood buffet on Saturday night and it was just ehhh with some of the food just not good. Then on two other occasions we did in-room dining because we were sick (not blaming Turtle Bay). Food was stale, especially the bread - couldn't even eat the bread (could probably break a glass window with it). Just unpleasantly surprised how bad the food was on such a nice resort. So overall - nice grounds, just don't expect any special treatment, and eat elsewhere. We really liked Ted's Bakery down the road, but we were sick for half the trip and didn't want to leave the room because of it. The other thing that annoyed me about this place were the doors. They shut EXTREMELY loudly if the person lets the door close itself. This gets on my nerves, so I would always shut the door myself quitely.

It's surrounded by the ocean for goodness sake. The grounds are gorgeous. That being said, the rooms are okay at best. They are aged, and have a strange (and not very pleasant) smell. I rejected the first room we were given, in part for this reason. The second room had the same smell, but by the time we got to it, I was getting used to the smell. It did not bother me after a very short period of time. I wouldn't attribute the hotel smell to it being dirty - Hawaii is a humid place.

Oh, and there isn't a whole lot to do at night, but I highly recommend dining on the beach at Ola. The garlic edamame is so yummy! Also, we LOVED Haleiwa, which isn't far from TBR. They have the best sashimi at the Breakers restaurant and bar. I had enough room left over for shaved ice on the way back to TBR.

We were well informed about the resort fee when we booked our vacation. We did book through an agent however, and she was able to get some great deals, like free breakfast at Palm Terrace every morning, and free admission to the Polynesian Cultural Center, Luau, and Night Show. Ok yes the food and drinks at resort are very expensive, but we had a car and loved exploring the little towns around the resort area. Our favorite place to go and eat was in Haleiwa. Lots of little eateries and restraunts that were delightful. We went to the nearby \"Shark's Cove\" for some amazing snorkeling. So much fun, so many fish and even some turtles. We loved that. Our room was clean, and newly renovated. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the pool. Our view from our Lanai was amazing. We loved having our morning coffee out there every morning. We went to Wakikki one day to visit, and I was so glad we didn't stay there. The North Shore's laid back atmosphere, was exactly what we were looking forward too in a vacation. There is not much or any for that matter nightlife activities, but like I said drive into Haleiwa and you'll find lots going on. We mostly called it an early night most nights, and were up bright and early exited to explore, relax, or my favorite snorkel. We were there for 10 days and wish that we could have stayed longer. I miss it so much! Hope this helps, don't pay too much attention to the naysayers, if you go planning to have a good time you will!

We don't like people fussing over us, so we were also happy with the moderate amount of attention we were given. I will say, the front desk staff could have been a little nicer. Hawaii has passed laws since this hotel was built that do not allow a hotel to be so close to a beach. This is a WONDERFUL reason to like this hotel and appreciate the \"old Hawaii\" feel of it. We walked right out of the hotel and you are on the beach! That is hard to find in Hawaii for this price. We also loved the golf courses. This is where LOST is filmed, so we were excited (and a little spooked) driving our golf carts through the \"dense\" tropical forrests. There were flowers EVERYWHERE! The Arnold Palmer course is especially wonderful. I think it is hole #17, but just as we were driving up near the green, the sun began to set and the hole is SO close to the ocean. We admit, we lingered there and let the other golfers pass us in order to take that view and moment in! The restaurant at the Golf Club is WONDERFUL! Overall, I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE, but I would tell you to go to the local grocery store on your way in and buy snacks and soda pop/liquor to keep in your room's refrigerator. The cost of drinks at the Hotel is OUTRAGEOUS! One more thing, they allowed us a late checkout with no penalty!

If you want valet service it is 10$ a time plus tip. Our Ocean View Room had a view of the roof of one of the lower levels which was littered with cigarette butts. The room was adequate, but just a bit tired and in need of a rehaul. The swimming pool had loungers that were so close together it was like sardines in a tin. There are not enough loungers given the amount of families there and once there was just no space at the pool at all. There seem to be a lot of people using the pool that were not staying at the resort, and the staff do nothing about this at all and just let it happen. The thing about Turtle Bay is that the location is beautiful and deserted, but because it is deserted they feel justified in charging a fortune for everything.

The food is pretty good-especially at Ola, the beach restaurant which is romantic after dark with the tiki torches all lit, but at $33 for a steak and $7 dollars for a beer, we were averaging about $120 a meal at night.

It was incredibly crowded - some sort of chorus competition took place while we were there and there were about 400-500 10 year old girls for the first few days. The beach is small and has a lot of coral so you can't swim in most of it. It's public access and also shared with a condo community so it's always crowded. You can rent snorkeling equipment but it's incredibly low quality stuff - we went through a few pairs of goggles and fins and couldn't find anything that fit. On the other side of the hotel there are a series of pools - several are dominated by unaccompanied kids, and then the big pool attracts a motley crue of teenagers and unusual characters. I'd recommend bringing your iPod. We moved chairs a few times to avoid kids who sat down next to us and promptly went on speaker phone to talk with friends. Not to sound grumpy, but I don't want to listen to an hour-long conversation about waxing when I'm at the pool.

There\u2019s no question Hawaii (especially Maui) is pretty. However, I\u2019ve found MUCH better, MUCH nicer, MUCH cheaper and MANY more to do in some third world countries! The place is a textbook tourist trap with an extreme lack of variety: paying for parking EVERYWHERE, \u201caloha\u201d attire as if it\u2019s mandatory uniform, brochures page after page of the same activities over and over again such as luaus, hula lessons, mai tai cruises etc. All of the above contribute to a lack of an \u201cunbeaten path\u201d for the more adventurous and daring. When I did come across a new area to explore, a big \u201cNO TRESPASSING\u201d sign is posted. Many of the locals are rude and unprofessional.

There is a huge crystal meth problem and they still give off the impression that tourists are are \u201cinvading their native land\u201d and creating \u201ccultural genocide\u201d probably not knowing that tourism makes up the majority of the revenue that Hawaii generates. The locals who are aware of the fact want the visitors to spend their money and leave. So much for \u201cAloha Spirit\u201d\u2026 Traffic on the southern section of Oahu is hideous \u2013it\u2019s basically L.A. on an island. North Shore was supposedly away from tourists and less congested which is partially true when compared to Waikiki and Honolulu. But I still sat in long traffic lines on my way up to my hotel in North Shore because all the tourists wanted to hang out there. And speaking of the hotel\u2026 Supposedly a getaway from crowds and the best the island has to offer, Turtle Bay Resort\u2019s slogan \u201cTrue Hawaii\u201d was well represented: expensive, tourists, a payment for everything and a total rip-off. The resort grounds were very nice but at $260+ a night you still had a room that consisted of a moldy stench that filled the room, a clogged air vent full of dust, feet sticking the bathroom tile (even when clean), mold growing between the grout, bed bugs, putting clothes in the drawer cabinets created mildew smell on clothing, outdated furniture and appliances and the bottled water in the room still wasn\u2019t complimentary. It\u2019s all stuff I normally wouldn\u2019t mind in Southeast Asia paying $5 a night for but when paying $260+ a night, it left me heated. Not to mention a $30 resort fee\u2026 for what?! Everything was paid for upfront but I still got charged AGAIN. Eventually I was reimbursed after a couple days but it was still an inconvenience nonetheless. To top it off, during my stay there the resort was evacuated due to fire 2 doors away. It probably wasn\u2019t the resort\u2019s fault, but it didn\u2019t make me enjoy it any better. If that was the best the island had to offer, I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be elsewhere. The typical scenario for a tropical vacations I\u2019ve had consisted of sipping cocktail\u2019s or a cold beer on the beach, getting massaged and fanned for hours. Not so in Hawaii; it\u2019s illegal to drink on the beach. Just swimming or snorkeling on the beach can get a bit tricky with the inconsistent weather. I\u2019d look out the door ready for the water, by the time I\u2019d get there it would be raining and windy. I\u2019m sure it has it\u2019s long periods of sunshine, just not when I was there. Hawaii does have it\u2019s scenic side and nice beaches but it lacked a \u201cjaw dropping effect\u201d that I\u2019ve experienced elsewhere which I hoped I would get considering the price tag involved. In my opinion it just wasn\u2019t enough to make up for it or lack of activity. The islands are small enough that once driven through or visited a few dozen times there becomes a lack of enthusiasm, a non existent things-to-do list and a huge presence of boredom. Visiting Hawaii as a tourist with lots of money who has never visited many exotic destinations prior would probably enjoy the place and may think they\u2019re getting their money\u2019s worth.

Make sure to check out the property\u2019s Web site because its advance payment options are less than kamaaina (local discount) rates. We booked an Ocean Front King Deluxe since the deluxe rooms are the only ones with full balconies. We were disappointed that our \u201cOcean Front\u201d room overlooked a huge, massive rooftop, swimming pool and porte cochere area. Since half the view was the ocean, I suppose it did qualify since in Hawaii, an Ocean VIEW room qualifies if you can see the ocean by stretching your head around the side of balcony. However, with taxes and that ridiculous $20 resort fee, paying $300/night was way overpriced. The bathroom was extremely dated with a showerhead that shot straight to the back and did not move. The sink head is positioned so washing you hands causes water to flow onto the sink. In the bedroom area, the bedside drawers are old and scratched, along with the walls and the baseboards. Everything is just very worn. One thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was how dusty the room was. I think they need to clean their filters because there was a layer of dust everywhere. At first I thought maybe housekeeping was a little lax, however, I left a black covered case out over night and in the morning, it too was covered with a layer of dust. The $20 resort fee is ridiculous and the reasoning of doing so by the hotel management laughable. They say that it is in result of comments made by past guests. Yes, I\u2019m sure that past guests said to stop nickle-and-diming, however, I\u2019m pretty confident that they meant the hotel should just include some of the amenities as complimentary as do so many other hotels \u2013 not to force a huge fee down our throat. The $20 resort fee covers overnight self parking, local and toll-free/credit card long distance access calls, wireless Internet, daily newspaper, self-serve coffee in room, in-room safe, one-hour of snorkeling equipment, one-hour of tennis court time and access to the fitness center. Resort fees are just another way for hotels to make their published room rates look lower than they actually are. \u2022 Phone calls: It is ridiculous to say that phone calls are a benefit since most people carry cell phones, many without roaming charges. \u2022 Parking: This is not Waikiki with limited land space and therefore, charging for parking is wrong. The Kohala Coast on the Big Island, for example is very expansive, and therefore, they do not charge for self parking. \u2022 Wireless Internet: It costs the hotel almost nothing to offer Internet service since they already have it for their business. \u2022 Room coffee/newspaper/safe: I mean, really? Might as well list the hairdryer and ironing board on the resort fee list too. \u2022 Fitness Center: There is nothing special about the fitness center. There is not full-time attendant on duty, no special amenities in the center. Many hotels include it as a complimentary guest amenity. \u2022 Tennis/Snorkeling: The hotel charges you if you go over the one-hour free rental time. Since you tend to lose track of time when leisurely snorkeling, this results in another opportune time for them to make more money off hotel guests. Regarding staff friendliness \u2013 the front desk and restaurant staff were pleasant. However, whoever mans the phones must do so part-time. At two different hours of the day, we tried to reach the operator. It rang repeatedly and we had to hang up and try again multiple times. At the pool, the attendants left much to be desired. They were nice when you went to exchange/return towels. However, their work stops there. Turtle Bay Resort is very windy. I saw several things laying on the pool deck because of the wind. The item that stands out is a diaper \u2013 it was new and must have dropped out of someone\u2019s bag. It sat right in front of the pool attendant towel desk for an hour. I watched them point and stare at it. It eventually flew into the pool and stayed there until a hotel guest took it out and placed it on the side. When I left a couple hours later, it was still there so I just threw it away. I guess it must not be the pool attendant\u2019s job or maybe they have strict union rules about not going beyond their job description. We also had some challenges with the pool food service. When we first arrived at the pool in the morning, we had someone from the pool restaurant come by a couple times in the next hour to see if we wanted to order something. However, after that, we couldn\u2019t get anyone to come by our chairs for the next couple hours. We finally had to walk up to the restaurant and get our own menus, which they clearly did not appreciate us doing, and told us that they would come to us and take our order. A half hour later they finally did come by. However, after saying all the above, if you are looking for an Oahu resort outside of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, Turtle Bay Resort is your best bet. The only other option is Ihilani Resort & Spa, however, it is in the middle of nowhere.

This is the place. This is Hawaii. We never even left the resort. The negatives expressed on other reviews are generally true. Yes, the hotel is a little worn in places. Sure, the rooms are laughably decorated in a horrifying tableau of greens. You won't have a state of the art TV (why anyone would turn the thing on while on vacation here is beyond me). The room renovations do seem halfway done as evident by the brand new green marble tile floor against the 1980s green tiled shower. The food and drinks are overpriced. The $20 a day resort fee is stupid. A staff member will be rude to you. Someone's children will annoy you. And...absolutely NONE of this will even matter because this place is a true paradise. We stayed in a second floor Oceanview Room (the cheapest available) and were awestruck by the view of the palm trees, the pool, and the bay outside the room. The hotel is built on a peninsula. There cannot be a bad view from any of the rooms. The rooms are suprisingly very large. There will be plenty of storage space. The room includes a small fridge and two sinks. All the important things have been updated - new carpet, new floor in the bathroom, new furniture, and comfortable bed. You will not be dissappointed in the room. The location of the resort is perfect. The property is absolutely breathtaking. It's tucked in a serene corner of the island about an hour away from Honolulu. The beaches are pristine and quiet. We hiked all around the property and found our own private cove where we can relax for an afternoon. There are sea turtles swimming on the coast. There are reefs teeming with beautiful tropical fish for snorkeling (you will have one free hour of snorkel equipment rental with your room). The swimming pools are great. Watch the sun set from a hot tub. It's a great all around getaway resort. We had no problems with the service at the hotel. The staff is very kind and helpful. You will spend about $70-$80 a meal on this resort, but the meals are exceptionally good with incredible views while you dine. Do avoid the barfood items (burgers, wings, pizza)...they are overpriced and not very tasty. There really is no other place like this on Oahu. You will not regret staying here. It was easy to overlook the minor flaws. In fact, I hope the resort doesn't go through another major updating because the likes of me could never afford it afterward. Let's face it.

I spent half my vacation in Wiakiki and the other half on the North Shore at Turtle Bay. Once you get tired of the crowds, sirens, traffic, and the hussle of a large tourist district, arriving at Turtle Bay is a real treat. Like everyone else has said, the location is breathtaking. It is the only resort on the North Shore so the hotel doesn't have to compete for ocean views like elsewhere. Each room will have a great view, it just depends on what you want to look straight down on - a pool, a beach, or the rooftop of their conference center (which by the way is nicely covered with dark rocks - no wires, pipes or A/C units to look at). I had a ocean front king room facing West (over the conference center but I hardly look down since I have a magnificent ocean to look at) on the top floor. I travel regularly to resorts so I was impressed with how large the room and balcony were. I found the room to be well maintained, though not brand new. The bathrooms haven't been updated so they don't look 4 or 5 star but were clean and spacious nonetheless. The room was nicely decorated in a modern style and I really appreciated the building's older construction since I never heard any noices from my neighbors (unlike the paper thin walls of the hotel in Wiakiki). I didn't feel unsafe or nervious about by belongings since I used the room safe for my valuables. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful but then I didn't have any problems to complain about. The grounds are very well maintained which may speak to why they had a wedding there every day of my stay. Like someone else mentioned, they have a towel policy (pretty normal), free parking, and several restaurant choices. I ate at most but really liked \"Lie Lie\" at the golf center for its seafood. The food and amenities (spa, tennis and golf) aren't inexpensive - you're in Hawaii. If you want cheeper eats, try the shrimp stands further east or drive 10 miles into Haliewa. Don't miss the shaved ice! Also, for a little over $200, you can get a helicopter flight that takes you all over Oahu (including Pearl Harbor) right from the resort's helipad. (see Debbie at Paradise - she's a star employee) Overall, Turtle Bay is a beautiful resort, well maintained, quiet, with gorgeous landscapes and views. Go there if you want to relax and get away.

It is located on the North Shores of Oahu and far and away from the traffic, the noises, and the hassles of Waikiki/ Honolulu. Most go to Hawaii to enjoy and take in the beauty of locale, not to be stuck in traffic nor to be in the mist of a busy city. There are miles of beaches around the hotel. You can drive to the other sites of the island as well. It will take you about 60 minutes to get to Waikiki if you so wish - the drive along Highway 83 is very scenic and well worth the time. Secondly, the service of the hotel is excellent. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The restaurant staff is also very attentive. Thirdly, the room are in good shape. One of the biggest worry I had before booking was the condition of the room. As a result, I decided to stay at the Ocean Front Cottage. No regrets! They do cost more but in my opinion was well worth the money. The room was well furnished, clean and open to the beach. You can walk directly from your room out to the beach. Check out the movie \" Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" to see how the resort is like and especially the Ocean Front Cottages. Overall, the stay at Turtle Bay was a positive experience.

Although the units' layout would be more aptly described as condominiums, parking for the villas has gated access as well as gated entry from the beach side (the first floor units have open patio areas, however). We were extremely pleased with the unit upon our arrival, with photos on the website accurately depicting the unit we had rented. Upon entry to the left was a large, tastefully appointed bath with travertine subway-type tile flooring and in the stand-alone steam shower (which was slightly smaller than I'd like personally, but the uber-deep soaking tub more than made up for it). We appreciated the neutral tones throughout, the updated trim, space-conscious pocket door for the wc, and properly-functioning stackable washer and dryer (detergent and dryer sheets were provided, no bleach however). The galley kitchen echoed the neutral color scheme with granite countertops/backsplash and high-end appliances. No dishwasher, but it really wasn't missed. Although the unit was studio-style, there was a half wall separating the bedroom and living areas, along with a large storage area/closet. The flooring in these areas was an attractive dark hardwood covered with neutral area rugs, and had comfortable furnishings. The mattress at first did seem a tad flimsy, but we had no problems sleeping through the night. Our girls slept well on their roll-out bed and pack n\u2019 play (which was not present in the unit upon our arrival, but was delivered in a reasonable amount of time after we placed a call to the unit manager). The lanai was furnished with a wooden/cushioned chaise lounge, matching side table and round dining table with seating for 4; we enjoyed relaxing there during our breakfasts and whenever we weren\u2019t out sightseeing. Unit 302 is on the top floor of the complex and had a wonderful view of the grounds and lagoon. The one somewhat major negative which I considered in my ratings of the unit (and not giving a 5 for everything) is that the views of sunrise and sunset were blocked by a. the eastern half of the villa complex and b. the taller main building of the resort, but we were often out and about at sunset. The unit was bright, well kept and was without any insect pests, nor did we hear neighbor noise unless we were outside. We did not require any maintenance other than for staff to bring the pack n\u2019 play, as everything within the unit functioned as it should. 302 was very clean but not spotless (literally- some of the chrome fixtures/stainless steel had water spots, and upon closer inspection during the week we found the beginnings of mold on the ceiling next to the shower. One other idiosyncracy was that we would catch the occasional whiff of sulfur when first turning un the shower, but it would dissipate within a minute or two). All in all we had a great time during our stay and would not hesitate to book the villa again. The unit and grounds were beautiful, although construction was being done at the time of our stay along the entry of the resort marred the views there. Nathan Olsen was efficient and quick to respond to contact during the reservation process, and a handout outlining the details of the rental was emailed before our trip; we used the \u2018contact\u2019 function on the site for specific questions, all were answered within a reasonable amount of time and to our satisfaction. We saw between 30-50% occupancy of the villa complex during our stay, and noted that the online rates would decrease as the desired booking date would draw closer;- something to keep in mind for last-minute travel : ) Please have a look at my other posted photos of the unit (within profile- posted first, reviewed second!)

It is great for almost everyone, but you have to know what you are booking before you go. I read the reviews on here, but I have learned to get a profile for people before accepting their review as canon. This place is quiet, and relaxed, and there isn't a ton to do on the North Shore other than hang out at the resort, surf, or drive around and go to shops. However, its a beautiful drive to Honolulu, and there is more than you could ever want to do in one trip in Honolulu, and you had to rent a car to get to Turtle Bay anyway, so one trip down to Honolulu if you are bored won't kill you. The Turtle Bay is great for couples, sure, but families would be great here too, there were tons of kids at the resort and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves...but there is also plenty of room to spread out and not have kids running and screaming into each other or you the entire time. One day a large group checked in on a business retreat, their conference rooms and facilities are huge, so I don't want to rule anyone out for this place, but know its not going to be the fast paced, everythign at your fingertips destination that is Cancun...not necessarily a bad thing. The one thing we missed from some other resorts is nightly entertainment put on by the resort, and being on the north shore, you are pretty far away from the options in Honolulu/Waikiki if you want to go every night...but that doesn't ruin it, this place is still fabulous to rest, relax, and drink a few! You do need to rent a car to get here, but its nice because it gives you a chance to drive up and down the North Shore, which is an adventure in its own right. The resort is beautiful, the grounds are immaculate, the whole North Shore is picture perfect. The staff was great, for everything. The rooms are simple, but they are well kept for their age, and they felt great to me. The villas are off on a secluded piece of beach, and looked nice from where we stayed, but it is a fair walk to almost everything at the resort from there, so keep that in mind. Sure, everything at the resort is expensive for food and drinks, but you are in Hawaii, and on vacation, and its no more expensive than any other destination. Meals will run you about $20-$40 per person with a drink, but its good food and great service, with lots of dining options. The shrimp shacks down the road are amazing, and fairly decently priced, and a must visit at least once if you like shrimp. For breakfast in the morning, the Palm Terrace lets you order food instead of doing their ridiculous $25 per person breakfast buffet, so don't be afraid to say, \"we'll order from the menu\" when they suggest the buffet. Breakfast items off the menu are $10 - $15 per person, and very well prepared. Also, a little secret, Lei Lei's is down attached to the Golf Pro Shop, and they serve breafast croissants and french toast for $8 a piece. It's a super short walk, and every morning we went there was no one in there except us, so most people must not realize it's there/it's cheap/i'ts open/it's good. I'm not sure why no one else ate there, but we had breakfast there 6 out of our 9 mornings. Alot of the other reviews have mentioned the Foodland grocery store down the street. For sure go this route to save a little money. We grabbed some sandwich meat, bread, cheese, and mayo, and a case of beer, and made lunch in the room and sat and dranka few cold ones in the middle of the day before heading down the the beach/pool to pay $6.50 a beer. They bring them right to you next to the pool though. The resort fee of $20 per day covers parking, WiFi (not necessary, your on vacation people), a newspaper everyday (read it...its fun to read about the island culture), and snorkel gear every day at the beach (definately go snorkeling!) I have heard people complain that it is a ridiculous fee, and while I agree they should build it into the room prices and just raise the per night rate, I understand why they don't, and everywhere on the island charges a per day parking fee, around $20, and it doesn't include any of the other resort amenities, so relax, understand it will be on your credit card when you check out, and just roll with it. If I didn't have a strict personal policy against going to the same place twice, this would be on my list of a must return destination.

We aren't newbies at traveling and all I can say is the negative reviews must come from some very picky people. It does not reflect our experience at all. Yes the rooms are simply decorated and a little scuffed in places but they were spotlessly clean and the scuffs just weren't a big deal.

I wrote the manager I sent him a letter. He replied immediately and he said they are upgrading the furniture and that people liked the avacado green walls and that we have to live with the flies at the breakfast bar. He did state he was training his staff to provide more supervision of the kids running all over the place and at the pool area. here is the letter I sent him. The walls were a sick green color which was not pleasant, the carpet had tears in it and it appeared that furniture was lacking or missing. In other words it would have been nice to have something other than the floor to put our suitcases on. There was only one suitcase stand in the closet but we had two bags. We liked the in-room fridge. We had problems with the wireless internet. My husband had issues with the head of your IT department but he said the IT technician was very nice\u2026his boss wasn\u2019t. There needs to be more clarity on setting the internet up with the business office for in-room internet service. The staff was very friendly and we really liked Joe Pack and most of the guys at the golf shop. However, we were a little put off because we booked two rounds of golf for ourselves on-line and decided to play a third round. The young man who booked us a tee time for the third round should have informed us that booking at the shop were going to cost 30% more than booking on-line. Had we known that we would have booked the third round on line from our room. My husband tried to show him our receipt from the previous day to show what we paid but he didn\u2019t seem to care (he was the same fellow when we checked in that booked the reservation at the shop). We did not like having chemicals sprayed on us while we played golf on the Palmer course. The spray made us nauseous and I had to call the pro-shop to ask why they were spaying while we were on the course. We ate at the golf shop Caf\u00e9 LeiLeia three times and it was good food at a reasonable price. I recommended it to everyone in the hot tub. A couple at the hot tub did not recommend your top of the line restaurant stating it was overpriced and her steak had to be sent back twice as it was overcooked. The older Hawaiian lady (Janet?) at the beach stand was awesome and friendly. She was the nicest person of everyone at the hotel. She made us feel welcome. I would add that the buffet for breakfast was OK for food selection (one day the bread was stale and the lychee type fruit was not cut open). I had to get the omelet chef to cut some open for me. There were too many flies at the fruit table. The unsupervised children running up and down while we were eating as well as crying babies made breakfast buffet an unpleasant event each morning. In fact I was dismayed at the number of children playing on the elevators and running up and down the halls of the hotel and in the lobby. On one occasion a naked baby was running at the pool level with no parent in site. I did not understand why hotel staff did not intervene and notify the parents that this behavior is unacceptable. The towel kids just sat around while this unsupervised baby is running around. It is very unacceptable for the amount of money people are paying. When I brought this whole problem of the noise / lack of supervision problem to their attention, the front desk staff shrugged it off. I figure it will take a missing or a drowned child on-site until the hotel realizes that unsupervised children in the hotel is something the staff needs to address with the parents. In fact we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for the third time the four days prior to Turtle Bay. We have also stayed at the Marriott in Waikiki. We paid $143/night at the Hilton and I think it was a much better room with nicer amenities at a much better value than your hotel. We were in Hawaii for our 20th anniversary as a romantic holiday. The Hilton made us feel like we were there for our 20th anniversary and it was quieter. Because of the large number of unsupervised children running around and the yelling and crying in the restaurant and lobby and hallways, Turtle Bay was not the romantic place as pictured in the brochures.

It wasn't cheap, but we were looking forward to going to a \"resort\" where we could relax and be pampered a bit. The positives: the valets who greeted us were super friendly and helpful. The lobby is beautiful with a knock-out view of the bay through huge windows. The golf course is lovely and the trails are beautiful, too. We saw a large sea turtle on the beach our first day. The beds and pillows are comfortable and bathrooms are nicely laid out with a refrig but no microwave. Negatives: the first room we were given was a king room on the 2nd floor. The view out of the dirty sliding glass door was the reddish composite roof and there was no lanai. The room was sparsely furnished, the lamp hanging over the single table with two chairs was rusted and dirty. One picture on the wall. Dustruffle on the bed matched NOTHING in the room. Furniture is a mismash of styles. The walls were painted a light green and the paint job was v ery sloppy. After considering for a few minutes, I called the front desk and asked that we be given a different room. I was told that my reservation limited us to the 2nd floor and that the room we had had the best view. But she offered us another room on the same floor (2 queens and a lanai) which was slightly better - at least we could go out on the lanai with our cocktails to watch the sunset! We still need to look over the red composite rooftop to see the bay. Bathtub is all chipped, shower curtain doesn't reach all the way across the bathtub, lighting in the bathroom area is ghastly (especially with the green paint everywhere) The buffet breakfast and dinner at the Palm Terrace were nice though overpriced. The evening entertainment in the restaurant was sort of sad - several Hawaiian guys playing mediocre renditions of Brown Eyed Girl and Girl from Ipanema. The best things they did were the two actual Hawaiian songs. The servers in the restaurant were nice enough, but not anything to write home about. Lunch at Leilei's was good -nothing special but decent and not too overpriced. We asked repeatedly to have someone come to change the incorrect time on the clock (we're not idiots, but we could not figure out this particular model) but no one ever came to do this small task. Suggestions: Go to Ted's bakery about a mile south for good plate breakfast and delicious pastries. Go to the Superette in Kakuku for delicious ahi poke.

We self parked because this fee is included in your mandatory resort fee so don't valet. We reserved a Pikake Jr Suite. This room is on the corner, very spacious. Has separate seating area and table and larger balcony. My husband and I love space so this was worth the extra money. This would have also been perfect for a family; so you may want to consider if you are traveling with smaller children. I agree with previous posters the rooms are very worn and are showing their age. They need to seriously update carpet, bathrooms, TVs, mattress, etc. Bathroom especially - tile very old - I wouldn't even want to think about taking a bath. The room did have a refrigerator so that was nice to keep drinks since everything is so expensive. There is a grocery store about 10 minutes away so you may want to stop there and get some drinks. We ate at Ola's first night. Nothing to brag about - just okay. Husband liked the salmon. On the beach so that was pretty. I think overpriced for the quality of food. My problems with the hotel began the next morning while eating breakfast at Palm Terrace. My husband had a golf tee time scheduled at 9:45. We went to Palm Terrace at 8 and ordered off the menu because we weren't that hungry enough for buffet. Well I think they forgot about our food because an hour later we didn't have our eggs and bacon. When I asked to speak to the manager this took an act of God. When manager, Mark ,finally came he wasn't that apologetic and told us to find him tomorrow if we come back to eat and he would see what he could do. Despite the fact that their poor service and error caused my husband to be late for his tee time they didn't even offer to take care of bill or bring us something else. I personally thought this was a poor reflection on management as I have had better service and treatment from IHOP. The following morning we returned for breakfast and asked for the same manager who told us to find him . He didn't even have the decency to come out and greet us and make sure everything was okay that day. He simply told hostess to take 20% of bill. I was personally insulted and again have received better service at IHOP. He could have at least come and talked to me in person! When he realized how upset I was he sent a bottle of champagne to me on my way checking out. Why would you send someone champagne when they are walking out the door. I can't take this with me on the airplane and I don't really drink much so this did not make up for the way I was treated. Also had dinner at 21 Degrees. Filet Mignon was excellent but again service just average. My husband and I are used to eating at restaurants and going to hotels with high level of service so were very disappointed by service. The most attentive person to us was the busboy. There are some nice restaurants about 20 minutes into town so you don't always have to eat at hotel if you have car. Beach area okay - no chairs around. Pool nice but we didn't get to enjoy because very windy when we were there. Used gym every day. Small but served it's purpose. I asked the conceirge for a listing of fitness classes offered at the gym and he said he didn't know this information. Again a higher quality hotel would have this information or get it very fast. We also had a couples seaside massage which was nice until I saw a mouse while waiting for my massage. The therapist was excellent and hearing the waves while getting a massage was very relaxing. Husband played the Arnold Palmer course and really loved it. Said the course was in pristine condition. This probably would be a good place for a golf getaway. Overall Turtle Bay was just average. Has potential to be a wonderful place as it has beautiful views and great location. They need to do some service training for employees and some major upgrades before I would come back.

The layout of the resort is nice and the location is scenic and the pool and beach also looked nice, but due to high winds we didn't spend any time enjoying it. The room was nothing special, kind of run down , dingy and sad, very uncomfortable bed, small tub/shower. The linens also felt cheap. We also ate dinner at Lei Lei's at the Golf Course one night. The food was mediocre, but with a few drinks and tax/tip, set us back over $100. I was very happy we only spent one night there, so we could move onto better accomodations.

Perhaps we are easy to please, but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Turtle Bay. The positives were the hotel is nice and clean (we had an ocean view room that was upgraded for us and we were moved to a higher floor for a better view). The staff was nice, the all you can eat breakasts with freshly made juices were wonderful, and we enjoyed being able to say \"we're on our honeymoon\" and everyone be nice to us or upgrade us! We toured the island (went to various beaches and the nature park that isn't too far away), went snorkeling (a lot!), tanned on beaches, swam at the hotel, lounged in hammocks at the hotel, went on a helicopter ride, went on a boat snorkeling ride, had some massages, went to the Multicultural center, attended some luaus, and were going to go hiking but just didn't have enough time for everything! And - we stayed only on the North Shore! We ventured into Honolulu our last day before our flight out, but didn't like it at all compared to where we were. It was really crowded. One other fun thing was that there is a web cam on the property, so we got to wave at our family at home! The not so high points were the lagoon/ beach at the hotel. It wasn't the best there was to offer on the North Shore but nicer beaches were within a few minute drive and had ample parking. There were even some fun diving rocks. Though the pool area had chairs though that overlooked the water and it was beautiful. Like I said above, the breakfast was great, but for lunch and dinner there weren't many good options. That was our biggest challenge - finding good food (which is important on a vacation). We even went to the grocery store and got a few things one day. We also ate dinner in the hotel one night and while it was good, the prices were too high for overcooked lobster. We ate lunch at the golf course and also ate dinner at another restaurant on the property and at lunch at the poolside cabana - all were average and overpriced in our opinions (the cabana was actually the best probably). We even tried the local \"shrimp trucks\" but they weren't good either. Also, the massages were great, but the stones were pretty darn hot - so beware of that. Also we didn't see any sea turtles and that was a little disappointing. It's not too cheap though. We (thank goodness) didn't worry about money since we were on our honeymoon, but I think the total for the trip was about $8-$10k for everything (including travel, car, and souvenirs). We have said we will go back and we will to celebrate an anniversary, but there are so many other places to go too it may be a few years before we make it back. It's a wonderful place.

I actually stayed here free because I used choice hotels points who are affiliated with Preffered Resorts and Hotels (ie. Turtle Bay Resort partners) First Impressions: We arrived at night so we couldn't really get a good feel of the surroundings and views until the next day. We were promptly greeted by the valet and bell persons. They were very curtious and unloaded all of our luggage onto a cart while I went to check in. To my disbelief we were upgraded from a deluxe room (which is there bottom of the line) to a beachfront cottage suite!! I had requested an upgrade because I am a Preffered Hotels and Resorts member (join this its free and you will always get somekind of an upgrade if it is available) I thought I might get a little upgrade but not the cottages. I have read many reviews and had never heard of anyone getting upgraded to a cottage so I wouldn't count on it again, but a really nice treat. Location: The location is incredible, definately the best part of the resort. Right on the tip of the island with bays on both sides (although only one of the bays is really safe for swimming). Can get a little windy but not too noticeable most of the time. Weather was great all but one day. Rooms: As I said we were upgraded to a beach cottage which makes it better. We went and looked at the other rooms and were pleased with them and would not have been disapointed if we had to stay in the main hotel. Furnishings were relatively new and linens were nice. There could have been a little more art or something, seemed like the rooms were missing personality. Overall pretty nice considering some of the reviews that I had read. The cottages are right on the ocean and have private hammocks and a grass area out your back door. Service: Nearly everyone at the resort were beyond helpfull and friendly. The cottages also come with a personal concierge which was awesome. Thank you Terry for all that you helped us with, you brought a real sense of the islands to us. We received fresh fruit and ice daily and pretty much anything that we could think of was handled with unbelievable promtness. Restaurants: This was probably the one area of our experience that was below our expectations. Lei Lei's: By far the best dinner we had at the resort. This restaurant is actually on the golf course and is pretty laud but the service and food made up for it. I had the giant on the bone ribeye steak...awesome! Ola: On the beach great location, very casual, service was mediocre at best, food was as expected, beach resort type of food, normal pricey. I would recommend eating lunch here as dinner seemed to be basically the same but twice as expensive. 21 Degrees North: This is there upscale restaurant. Great sunset, pricey but not outrageous, mediocre service, food was good but lacked a real distinct taste, not nearly as good as I had hoped. Palm Terrace Buffet: Did not eat here but past reviews were not great Drinks throughout the resort are very pricey $7-10 for a fruity island drink with very little alcohol. I don't quite understand some of the incredible horrible reviews given to these restaurants. Some comparing the food to Denny's (I don't know what Denny's you have been too but sign me up). Others saying the prices are insanely high. Yes the prices are not cheap but they are normal for a resort especially one that doesn't have much of anything around it for miles. Nightlife and Entertainment: Besides the Friday night Luau on the grounds entertainment seemed to be a drink and a good book. Not much of anything. But that was OK with us because having a 17 month old and waking up to watch the sunrise was much more entertaining! Local knowledge and tips: We ate all of our breakfasts on our lanai (saved us a bunch of money) there is a great Foodland grocery store 15 minutes south or 10 minutes in Kahuku. They have great sandwiches and fresh sushi. The fruitstands near the resort were the best fruit as the grocery store carried fruit that was not even grown in Hawaii. Teds Bakery 10 minutes south is great for breakfast and pastries. Try the chocalate macadamia rasberry tort...awesome. Sharks cove grill near the Foodland is a great place to grab a bite to eat and sit under the tent at night with the torches going. Best vegetarian burger I have ever had. Hukilau Cafe in Kahuku is a little on the shady side (poor neighborhood) but was the least expensive meal we had in Oahu and had one of the best burgers of my life. Overall impressions: Loved every minute of our trip. From the moment we pulled in till we had to drive away we were treated like royalty. This is a place to just relax, let yourself go, and take in the true Hawaii. Can't wait to go back. We headed off to Wikiki for 5 days after we left and were truly disapointed. It seemed like our vacation was over when we left Turtly Bay.

We didnt want to compare the Hyatt to Turtle Bay until the end of our trip. They stated that the resort had just been completely remodeled. I think they may have meant they cleaned the pond water. The rooms were much smaller than the Hyatt, the coffee basket had mold in it, the bathroom was very dark and had no vent, beds were very hard, housekeeping would knock and then walk right in, and the windows were filthy. Now going to Hawaii everyone should expect to spend some money. I dont mind paying for a good meal here or there, however, the average meal for breakfast alone was $80, and thats with two adults, and two kids, and the meal wasnt very good. We went to the Cheesecake factory the week before, spent less for dinner, and had a full meal of leftovers for the next day. Not a family/kids friendly resort. Pool closes at dusk, no pool flotations or toys allowed, room was dark in general, and even though they were extremely over Staffed, they Staff was very unfriendly and not willing to help in any way. Not much to do there either as for activities. We did go snorkling, but the water was very merky. We ended up renting a car to go to WalMart to buy food for the week. $250 a day for 5 days was way to much to spend on just food. And the only pizza delivery was Dominos. One night of that is to much. There were only two positives to staying at Turtle Bay; The waves on the North shore were HUGE. Surfers had a very hard time surfing because the were so tired by time they got out there. And the ocean side massage for my wife and I was great, but most messages usually are. They did tell us to arrive at least 30 minutes early at the Spa so we could enjoy the steam room. Well, the steam room in the Mens locker room was under maintenance, which they knew about when they told us to come early. So we sat outside for 45 minutes waiting for the massage. I did sneak into the ladies locker room and use their steam room after our massage. Ladies were coming and going and my wife told them I was in there, and the girls were all very nice about it and it didnt stop them from taking showers while I was in there. Overall, if your going to Hawaii and want to have a great time, stay at the Hyatt at Waikiki Beach. Much better accomidations, shopping, street performers, beach is right there, shopping, activities, restaurants, and an overall better feel.

This is a nice get-away for families. I loved the beautiful location of this hotel on the north shore of Oahu and spent hours watching the waves. I was disappointed that hotel wasn't more luxurious but the views are priceless and we paid a lot less than we do at other beach hotels. It's quiet but there is a lot to do if you want to be active. We went horseback riding (not the most exciting) and contemplated playing tennis but never got off our pool chairs. Golfers have 2 courses to enjoy. There is a beach & cove on either side of the hotel. One is sandy and has snorkeling. The other is popular with surfers and is too rough for your average swimmer. But the water was quite cold in December which surprised us. There was also a strong wind every day coming off the ocean which made the pool area chilly after 2 pm. Be sure to bring a light sweater for evenings in the winter. As for the hotel, this is not a 5-star resort and the rooms are showing their age. The lobby is lovely with the big windows overlooking the ocean in 2 directions, but other areas of the hotel could use a facelift as well. I understand it used to be a casino in the '70s which explains some of the funky architecture. We didn't see inside the villas but our friends highly recommend them. Our rooms were big and basic with balconies and great views. Our rate was reasonable but I was surprised by the state of the bathrooms. They were worn and small, with peeling paint, and small bath/shower combos. The staff is very welcoming -- everyone from the reservation desk to the maid were very kind and helpful. The restaurants are good and we had many nice meals, but the menus are limited when eating there every night. If you want to eat outside the resort, be aware that this is the quiet side of the island and there aren't many options, especially at night. The hotel's restaurants seem popular with the locals. Be warned that you should make reservations for Christmas dinner or brunch well in advance or you may lose out. We thought we could eat at the beachside grill but it was closed and everything else was full. We ended up in the bar which was a disappointing option on Christmas. It takes about an hour to drive to Honolulu so you are removed from the action which is a plus or minus, depending on your point of view. The cute town of Haleiwa is about 20 minutes away by car. My teenager would have liked to be closer to a town with a little more activity. Overall, we would stay here again but maybe for a shorter stay.

Every single employee we encountered was genuine and kind. Special kudos to Virginia at the Coffee Cart in the lobby in the mornings. We meandered and talked about specialty local coffees with her both mornings -imagine that a person serving coffee that KNOWS about Coffee :) The gentlemen who drove the golf carts were conversational and fun to talk to, the female concierge we encountered went out of her way to explain the ambience of the different restaurants when choosing for my b-day dinner.

If I would have left Hawaii having visited only Maui Marriott Ocean Club and Sheraton Moana Surfrider- I would have never planned to go back to Hawaii- but becasue of TB, the north shore of Hawaii will be our next big vacation. OK, so now for the ugly- and there is some. The prior reviews stating how worn and tired the rooms are, are completely correct. If these rooms were located in a different location- it would be a Motel. Small pillows, hard beds, bathroom from the 1970's. Usually I'm a snob about this kind of thing but truly, the transcendent experience that the location, staff, and common areas that TB gives- I overlooked the dated and ugly room. Our plan for next time is to spring for one of the 'Sarah Marshall' bungalows and enjoy this place thouroughly. I emailed my gushing compliments and constructive criticism regarding the old rooms to the GM and he responded saying that they have massive plans for room renovations in 2009- great news!

We arrived a few days after severe rains had flooded the area. Our room was very cute with a small balcony and a beautiful ocean view. We were very excited to stay at the Turtle Bay resort and the service was excellent. The food was great, the staff friendly, and the grounds were amazing. On our second day we played a round of golf there on the Fazio course. Because of the rain, a few of the holes on the back nine were affected by the flooding. But, you could see the staff working hard to restore the course. In spite of that, we had an awesome round of golf and enjoyed every minute! One evening, we attended a luau at the Turtle Bay. While it was smaller in scale that other luau's we had been too, it was still wonderful. It was held indoors because of the weather, but the food was incredible and the dancers, who were from the Polynesian Cultural Center, were even better. The evening culminated in a fire dance outside. This was the best part of the evening!! The surrounding area is quiet and picturesque. This area is what they consider the country and for nightlife you would be better entertained on the hotel grounds or in Honolulu. There are a few places to eat in the area off the resort. Our favorite was Ted's Bakery!! We ordered the Loco Moco to share. The place was packed with locals and tourists alike. Be sure to wait outside after you order. They will bring your food to you. This place is a must if you are interested in experiencing the authentic Hawaiian plate lunch. They also had a full bakery that looked so delicious!!! You won't be disappointed. We also spent some time in Hal'ewa. This is a cute little town with lots of shopping and eating. We also did the maze at the Dole Pineapple Plantation. This was fun, but we got a little dizzy following the maze! Tamura's north of Waikiki, is an excellent place to curb your Poke fix. We love the stuff and bought 3 different varieties. They make about 8 different varieties there. Overall, this was one of the best experiences we've had on our travels. We can't wait to return, and will definitely stay at the Turtle Bay resort again.

On another occasion, I was standing behind a man she was helping--she left the desk (never acknowledged me, didn't say she'd be back--she just left me standing there). Restaurants were good, but there is nothing, absolutely nothing to do after sundown--not even at the bar--they really should come up with something for night entertainment.

Loved everything about the resort from the moment we arrived. The staff, the food, our room, the beautiful extensive resort grounds. We stayed in room 217 and had a perfect view. Our room was in excellent condition and fit the zen/modern aesthetic that we prefer. The bed was so comfortable and often left the sliding doors open at night so we could hear the waves. We could look down from our room onto the swimming beach, and had a perfect view of the sea turtles that were always feeding in the rocky shore area. Also, the self-parking was not a long walk at all and we couldn\u2019t believe people complained about it. We really enjoyed watching the surfers while having a drink next to the bar, and strolling around the resort grounds. You can spot sea turtles in the bay at any given time, if you look carefully. They are everywhere at the resort. The sunsets views from the resort were also spectacular. The entire experience was positive and very romantic. We took long walks through the grounds and recommend walking along the trails to the resort\u2019s deserted beaches, which are past the horse corral. I recommend that everyone who would enjoy a 2-3 mile walk to visit the Banyan tree forest along the trails. The trees are spectacular. We took surfing lessons at the resort, and loved our instructor Bobby. He was a great instructor. The waves were really big the day we went, and were a very tough workout. Watch out for that sharp coral sea bottom on many of Oahu\u2019s beaches or you can get some nasty scrapes! Food: Our first night we attended the resort\u2019s annual seafood festival, Chef\u2019s Under the Stars night. Had absolutely fabulous food and drinks, listened to a wonderful authentic Hawaiian band, and enjoyed the beautiful weather. That was a great night. Our favorite restaurant was 21 Degrees North, followed very closely by Lei Lei\u2019s. We enjoyed two fabulous meals outdoors at Lei Lei\u2019s. I highly recommend the Caesar salad, ahi tuna steak entr\u00e9e, and prime rib. It was possibly the best ahi tuna steak either of us had ever had. We also had their chocolate chip cookie sundae, and it was pretty good. We had two outstanding dinners at 21 Degrees North as well. Their specialty martinis were delicious and worth the steep price tag. They must have an actual mixologist on hand designing their drinks. They were wonderful. We have nothing but raves about the food here, which is made with many local and organic ingredients. We had the lobster bisque, tomato basil soup, heirloom tomato salad with spiced lump crab and mozzarella, grilled Caesar salad w/ pineapple and a lovely crab-crusted fish entr\u00e9e. We recommend every dish and drink we ate there. Had decent bar food at the Tap Room, chicken fingers, fries and quesadillas. Our only restaurant meal disappointment at the resort (and during our vacation on the island) was Ola. We stopped there twice to review the dinner menu and both times found the hostess to be snobbish. She was willing to seat us for dinner, but when a casually dressed man asked to make a reservation for that night she turned him away? We ended up having lunch there once, and I got the slider trio, while my husband had an poke rice bowl. I didn\u2019t care for the flavors of either dish. We recommend touring the North shore, including surf town Haleiwa, which was a scenic and relaxing 15 minute drive from the resort. We also recommend visiting the windward/Eastern shore, and the town of Kailua.

Select this hotel resort if you're looking for a hide-a-way and don't select it if you want the shopping/tourist \"Hawai'i\" The hotel/resort is rated 4 star and appropriately so. I had found several very negative \"reviews\" on Trip Adviser, so I was very skeptical when my travel department selected The Turtle Bay Resort for me. I could find absolutely NO BASIS for the hammering that is found in the Trip Advisor, and I'm a very picky (and experienced) traveler. This is a place suited for those that want to quietly unwind, maybe play golf, ride a horse and/or veg out. The rooms, baths, showers, bedding were all in very good condition. Staff is friendly and helpful. I'd say \u201cexcellent\u201d, as was housekeeping. Raymon (Front Office) was very helpful and accommodating. Activities include golf, horse-back riding (They have a stable) and water-related activities. The hotel is located directly on a large (and clean) beach. Valet ($10) and free self-park is available. The hotel charges a $20 per day resort fee. This also includes free local and tell-free calling and excellent wired and wireless high speed internet. (although it's unsecured) The hotel/resort is definitely value priced. (not so with \"restaurants\". Now enough of the Good and on to the Bad and Ugly. First, the not-so bad: The Palm Terrace is located in the main lobby and serves a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner at moderate prices. The charbroiled burger is great. They offer good buffets as well. Service is very good. You can expect to spend $20 for a full breakfast and $25 for lunch. I'd describe Palm Terrace as a cut above Denny's and a cut below Chili's but with a great view of a cove and consistently friendly staff. The hotel has an independently owned \"Gourmet\" (laugh, laugh) restaurant called Ola. On the beach itself and open on all sides, the location and view is perfect. The food, service and prices are a JOKE! My server was Raymond C and I'd say that he was rude, inattentive and unsuitable for a supposedly 1st rate restaurant. The prices ($100 per person) are completely out of line. For $100 one expects a 1st rate, world-class dining experience. I had: Mai-Tai ($11.50), Wild Mushroom Salad ($16), Scallops with added-on 8 ounce lobster ($45) and a class of Chardonnay ($8). Total without tip was $95 with tax. The salad was far from fresh. It was wilted and dirty ! There were no \"wild mushrooms\". Just not very fresh looking button and small portabella local supermarket-type mushrooms. The Scallops and 8 oz lobster tail were OK. Much like what you'd get a Red Lobster for 1/3 the price (and you'd have better service) Presentation...fah-ghet-about it ! On the scale of Denny's. Wine was served in stemmed water glass. On exiting, I gave my impressions, privately, to the \"Manager\" (Robert) who became rude and invited me to lease post-haste. Not too be completely deterred, and compelled by the outstanding setting, I returned for breakfast. Orange Juice was $4.50, Coffee $3.50 and Omelet was $16. Total $25 without tip. Breakfast service was OK, no presentation but the food was what you'd expect from a Denny's. Located on Golf Course the (the hotel can deliver you there via golf cart in 3 minutes) is the Lala restaurant. Moderately priced, excellent service, basic menu, akin to a 3 star local restaurant. The excellent service is attributable to Owner Ian's constant presence and vigilant eye. He clearly has a good handle on everything. I had an 8 ounce cut of prime rib. It seemed more like 10 ounces and was perfectly cooked. The bar tender was lazy and refused to provide a fresh sliver of lemon skin for my Gray Goose on the rocks. It's a pleasant experience and if you're looking for an on-site alternative to Ola, you won't be disappointed at Lala. The Hotel's high end restaurant is called \"Twenty-One Degrees North\", and was not open during my stay. I examined the menu and the decor. Although very pricey as well, it offered an upper end menu selection, better than average wine list. I would have like to check it out. Overall, I can recommend the Turtle Bay Resort as a beautiful, quiet place to relax without the hustle of a tourist trap. Recognizing this is a 4 star rated resort it is appropriately rated. Just have the proper expectation with respect to dining (there's a Foodland supermarket 6 miles away) There are several smaller towns located within a 20 to 30 minute drive that offer local shopping for island goodies and some local and diverse food fare.

We came home with mixed feelings. First we stayed in the cottages. If you decide to stay in these be sure you know where your going. We were sent way down to cottage 125 and it is far from the hotel, pool and swim beach. Plus the ocean is kind of far from your cottage. We asked to be moved closer to the hotel and the water and ended up in 102 which is much more convenient and very close to the water and there are surfers right in front of your room every day. Complete privacy and a trek to pool and facility go higher in number for the cottages.....close go low numbers...they start at 100. The cottages are lovely, but I somewhat regretted our decision not to be in the main building on a high floor to take advantage of the location and stunning view. The cottages are not located on the swim beach so you can't just swim right out in front of your room. The swim beach is on the other side of t he resort. I guess our biggest complaint was the food and food options in the area. We didn't have a decent meal the whole time we were gone to be honest. All of the venues for food at the hotel were ridiculously expensive. Prohibitive in fact. For 2 hotdogs, fries, fruit and 2 drinks we paid $50.00 for lunch from Hang 10. We ended up at the local foodland to pick up sandwhich stuff, cereal and snacks, but for dinner you either pay$$$$ or you drive 25 minutes to the nearest town which was very crowded with little parking. Even the food we had at the resort was not good food. We did find the shrimp trucks but sadly were not impressed with those either. Ted's bakery is not just a bakery they do have food and it was decent, but not great. The other thing I noticed the most is that there isn't any music here of any kind. We were on Maui and Kauii last year and everywhere we went including our hotel there was either hawaiin music being played with a few hula dancers or it was being played on a stereo adding to the atmosphere of a hawaiin vacation. There was not one bit of music and it took away from our vacation. Music really makes a difference. It doesn't have to be obnoxiously loud, just background tropical music, for your tropical vacation. Someone on here mentioned a luau....which we discovered after we left is held only on Friday. We were there on a Friday and never heard one word about it. Nor did we even know where it was or hear any music that night either. Technically if you don't mind paying way too much for the food you get that isn't very good, you wouldn't need to leave the property during your vacation, but we were pretty dissapointed in our stay here. Lastly, the housekeeping staff ignores the do not disturb sign, so beware. The location is fantastic, but it doesn't make up for what it lacks.

There were no robes in the room, when I called they brought them right up. Everyone was very friendly and went above and beyond. The land that the hotel sits on is great, but the building and rooms are just so outdated and frankly sad and dirty that it is depressing. To sum up, I'd avoid this hotel for the price. There are many better options for less. I used the spa, which is also in desperate need of a refurbishing, it is nothing special and resembles a locker room at best. But the massage I had was great and the people were lovely. The restaurants are very expensive and only ok. The breakfast buffet was good but not for the price. 21 degrees north was also very overpriced for the food.

If this was it, I'd still give it a higher review, but it isn't: The food stunk. It was awful--barely fit for a dog--and very expensive. For breakfast, my wife and I ordered a classic double egg meal. Our eggs were cooked well, but the toast was overdone and cold, the hash browns were half raw, half-charred and had been sitting in oil for who knows how long. They almost made me ill. The orange juice was terrible. And this crap cost us $34, including the 20% discount the manager gave us after we complained. The next day, we tried a burger at Olas for lunch. It was disgusting. They mixed mushrooms and onions into the burger and added bad lettuce and an under ripe tomato. Even more hilarious, they gave us a nearly empty ketchup bottle--where you have to shake it to get the ketchup out and it tasted like it was a cheap generic brand in a Heinz bottle (I really do think it was.) The included French Fries were some cheap brand almost cold; you get better stuff from your grocer's freezer. Then there was the bad lemonade. And this cost us $28. (Let me put this in perspective; I hate McDonald's and they serve both better breakfasts and lunch/dinners than the restaurants at this place.) The resort nickel and dimes you to death (they charge a $20 resort fee a day--but then they charge extra for almost everything.)

I complained, and got a much better room, overlooking the pool, the bay and the mountains all at once. That made a considerable difference in my opinion of this property. The rooms are pretty basic and functional. They also leave a stuffed animal on the bed, which I promptly put in a drawer. I don't like those kinds of things -- I always wonder who has been handling them. Yuck. On this trip to Hawaii, we had stayed at the Marriott Waiohai in Kauai and the Westin Moana Surfrider in Waikiki. The difference in quality between those top tier hotels and Turtle Bay Resort is evident. Maybe it's that the rooms are older and although upgraded, just can't match the quality of the other two. The air conditioning in the lobby is cranked up to Arctic levels. We tried to eat at their clubhouse type restaurant but it was just too cold. We ate in the restaurant by the pool for breakfast and had the best omelet I think I've ever had -- packed with vegetables. We also ate at the golf course restaurant -- so so.

As soon as we arrived via the long drive way entrance leading upto the main hotel, we knew we had made the right choice for our stay on Oahu. The hotel is awesome, we loved the open to the elements reception area as our first impression of the hotel. Booking in was easy even if our booking had for some reason been cancelled. Not a problem though, the hotel re-registered us as guests (as we had pre paid) and we got our ocean front deluxe room. Our first impression of the room was a bit of a let down. Soon as we opened the room door myself and my wife for some reason were just expecting something a little bit more deluxe than we actually got. We didnt think the room was poor, just not ultra deluxe as we were expecting. It was just nice but nothing more. The balcony and view were fantastic and to wake up each morning to the sound of the waves was so great. Only downside with the view is the flat roof that stretches out infront of all the deluxe rooms on the front of the resort. The Hang Ten bar was great. The ahi sandwiches were to die for. Drinks were not that expensive either. Myself and m,y wife loved the Monkey Lunchies cocktails. Well worth the $11 each. The Palm Terrace was our worst experience as the service was poor and the food was just ok. We ordered clam chowders to start. Mone had loads of fish and potatoe in it and my wifes had none!!!! The Pizza we shared for our main course, again was ok but they failed to clear the table of our half finished starters while we ate our main course. They had also run our of spoons for the chowder!!!!! I asked our waiter how he expected us then to eat the chowder and suggested we used the tea spoons!!!! We really didnt like this particular restaurant and to cap it off we lost our camera here. We left it on the table by mistake and someone nicked it as it was necer handed in. By far the best restaurant was Ola. Brilliant brilliant brilliant. We had two meals here, both of which were fantastic. Try the garlic shrips with pasta or if your a meat eater try the beef. It just melts off the bone. The taco meat starters are also fab. We just cant fault this place whatsoever. Service and Food were 10 out of 10. Not the cheapest place we have ever eaten but well well worth it. The Bay Club bar was also good for food and a great place to have drinks if you just fancy a few cheeky drinks after a meal at Ola. 21 Degrees North looked nice but the menu didnt appeal so we didnt eat here so cant really comment. The pools are great fun and the slide, even though its for kids is still good fun for adults too. I had 5 go's on it to my wifes amusement. Hot tubs are near by and are great also. As it was our honeymoon we splashed out and took a trip with Paradise Helicopters who are based on the resort. Well worth the money. The Oahu experience lasts for 40 mins and shows you all the points of interest over the island. The staff here were friendly and very helpful. Keep a look out for the pilots surfing dog!!! Yes a dog that can actually surf. All in all a fantastic hotel, great and helpful staff. Expensive but well worth it apart from the Palm Terrace.

Turtle Bay is the place to relax, there is no night life (go to Vegas for that) we didn't want night life, we didn't want noise and we got just that. I did find out the hotel is now owned by the state of Hawaii, so the few repairs our updating that needs to be done, I am sure is not a priority for the state.

Take notice the hotel is \"true Hawaii\" its not completely brand new, it has a charm that makes you feel truely away from it all. We appreciate that. I would recommend, Lei Lei's at the golf course, best food we had. Skip Olas, terrible and not owned by the hotel. The food at the pool bar is very good (try the Ahi salad). Try Ted's Bakery, Pizza Bob's (try the wings, excellent) and Spagettini. We also got snacks at Foodmart, and some alcohol for our room. Made drinks and took them around the beach and pool.

When I finally got fed up with their 3 star service, I asked for a manager (that was another 15 minute wait). I ended up going to the front desk manager and he basically handed me off to the Food and Beverage Manager and all she did was take my plates off our table. NO discount!!!

Note that if you want partying, Bulgari, and Cartier, this place isn't for you - head south east to Waikiki. However, if you want long white sand beaches, quiet days, and not another hotel for 15 miles, come to TBR. Pros: * Reasonable room pricing - you can get an ocean front room for around $225 in low season if you shop around * Well maintained facility - it's right on the ocean (I'm sitting 10 feet away inside right now), but they do a great job keeping the place fresh * Amazing grounds - 880 acres to explore - all on the ocean and beautifully landscaped * Super friendly staff - friendly without [--]-kissing * 6 restaurants on property - important because there is not much else around here * Rooms are fine - nothing five-diamond or amazing (altho i hear the beach bungalows are swankier), but clean, comfortable, and all with great views * Huge pool (actually 1 huge one, and two smaller ones for kiddies with waterslides) * Free wiFi thoughout the resort * Great spa treatments \u2013 right on the ocean in a little hut. * Lamonts (convenience store) \u2013 open from 7am-11pm right by the pool \u2013 super convenient Cons * The pool needs a bottom resurfacing - parts of the smooth plaster has worn away in places in the kiddie end, leading to more than one scraped knee as the kids go down to play. * The poolside drink service is terribly slow - once you order, it's quick, but finding someone to serve you $10 mai tais can be challenging - and that's just annoying * The food prices - just get ready to pay LOTS to eat here. Burgers are $15 and up, entrees average $28, starters $10-13. It's not that much worse than any other big city, but since there is nowhere else to eat unless you want to get in the car and drive to Lai'e or Haleiwa (both not too far away), every meal at these prices gets spendy. Most lunches cost us $70 and dinners were usually around $90-100. * The resort fee - annoying $20 fee that covers WiFi, parking, snorkel gear, etc. I just find hidden fees annoying. * Minor gripe - parking is a hike away. Easy enough to drop your wife or hubby off and you can go park, but it's a trek. Valet is an additional $10. Tips while staying here: * Stay on the side facing the pool, not the pacific if you want a lanai that is bigger than a postage stamp. You still get amazing views, but you can actually use your lanai. Anything on the pacific side has little juliet balconies - worthless if more than one person wants to sit out there. * Restaurants on property (in order of how much we liked them): \u2022 O'la (lunch + dinner) \u2022 21 degrees (dinner - liked it more than Ola, but just pricier), \u2022 Lei Leis (dinner - golf course dining - but nice food and service), \u2022 Palm Terrace (dinner - was pretty good, but atmosphere felt like a cafeteria), \u2022 Bay Club (the bar on property - bar food), \u2022 Hang10 (lunch) - actually good food, but the service was so bad (slow) both times that the latter time we left and walked over to Ola - serves poolside fare. * Restaurants off property (in order) \u2013 \u2022 Hukilau in Laie - local place, cheap, and the burger will blow your mind. \u2022 Haleiwa Joes - in Haleiwa - on the water, good seafood, place for kiddies to run around. \u2022 Romy\u2019s Shrimp Stand \u2013 they pull them out of the farmed pond behind the truck, cook them up, and you eat them. Amazing if you like peeling your shrimp. If not, pass. \u2022 Ai-something burgers in Haleiwa \u2013 big fresh burgers \u2013 not bad \u2022 L &L Drive Ins (lai\u2019e and Haleiwa) \u2013 plate lunches \u2013 local chain \u2022 We\u2019re going to hit Ted\u2019s Bakery this AM \u2013apparently it\u2019s awesome and just down the road \u2022 Various fruit stands dot the side of the road \u2013 get some fresh coconut or pineapple or avocado. \u2022 Go to Foodland in Lai\u2019e or just north of Haleiwa and stock up on beer, water, chips, breakfast stuff, etc. There is a fridge in the room that you can put stuff in (small, mind you).

Even though Turtle Bay is away from most of the traditional sights to see on Oahu, it's worth the drive. The hotel is awesome, the food is awesome and the staff is awesome. The concierges at the hotel were among the best we'd ever encountered, recommending some off-the-beaten-path stops such as the Macadamia Nut Farm (which has very little to do with macadamia nuts), Papa Ole's eatery (so small I can't even call it a restaurant) and several others. Turtle Bay is still within driving distance of the Dole Plantation, Pearl Harbor, the Polynesian Cultural Center and Waikiki, but it's far enough away to be a quiet retreat. The three-bedroom villa was perfect for us and our 3 teenagers. It's equipped with a full kitchen, a dining room and a living room, and perhaps the best thing about it.....a washer/dryer. Since we were going to be in Hawaii for 2 weeks, not having to pay resort prices for laundry and not having to hunt around for a laundromat was a great plus.

We did the Friday night luau and it was great, food pretty good too. The dancers from the polynesian cultural center perform, saved us the time and money of going out there. We did rent a car, which is almost a must if you stay longer than 3 days I would say, otherwise the restaurants are too pricey. We did eat at Ola's on the beach which was very romantic, food ok, not great. But we did eat really well at Ted's Bakery and Cinnamon's at Kilua. Got some snack ect. at a local Kmart and Foodland is close on the way to the resort. My sister and did the Sunday brunch and just loved it, wonderful according to her.

They were very nice and gave me the keys to a room on the 4th floor for me to take a look at. I when to the room and quickly realized how lucky I was on the 6th floor. The fourth floor room had a view of the banquet facility\u2019s roof. I returned to room 629 with a greater appreciation of the room that I had been given. The hotel is a little tired (warn down). It is not terrible, but it needs a little work. For example, when the elevator doors opened to the 6th floor, the first thing that I saw was a bunch of wall paper that was pealing back at the seams and the carpet was very warn down in the hall, and the furniture in the common areas was a little dated. The good news is that the room had fresh carpet, newer furniture, and beautifully painted walls. The entrance to the hotel is also uninspired. It is a long street that comes in from the highway. It is dark and boring. They should take a trip to the Desert Springs JW Marriott in Palm Desert, California and take notes. Both have long streets in from the main road but they are worlds apart. The \u201cDrive\u201d (covered valet area) is also too understated for such a large hotel. The bottom line is there is no \u201cWOW Factor\u201d when you first arrive. After flying for 6 hours and driving for an hour from the airport, it would have been nice to have a moment of excitement when I pulled in. First impressions shape the visit. This, however, may not matter to you. I had a \u201cpet peeve\u201d (which was shared by many guests) that may not matter to you. They are shamelessly selling EVERYTHNIG in the room. Which in itself is not so bad, but next to everything there is a comment card informing you that if you remove the product from your room you will be charged. I felt that it was juvenile, almost a threat. Here is an example: Part of the resort fee is in-room coffee. Ironically, there are no \u201cto-go\u201d cups in the room and next to the nice Turtle Bay cups that you MUST use and, of course, they want you to buy, there is a note saying that if you remove the cup from the room, you will be charged $5 for the cup. HELP, I am held hostage in my room! I can not leave until I finish my morning coffee! It is a beautiful place to walk around in the morning, to-go coffee would have been nice. There is also a towel card, and in parental fashion it says that \u201cyou will be charged $25 for a towel if the card is not returned with your room keys\u201d\u2026\u2026 what resort does that? The answer is none. In fact, after talking to the front desk I learned that this resort does not even follow through on this obnoxious threat. One comment about the resort fee: I do not mind that they charge the $20 resort fee, I just want them to give me something in return. They should include valet parking in the fee ($10 additional) or have a appetizer during happy hour (they make the money up on drinks anyway), and the wireless internet you get with the fee was NOT HIGH SPEED internet. It is 50-100KB per second, which is medium speed (I think of it as the internet on \u201cHawaii time\u201d). Don\u2019t try to download files or send attachments unless you have plenty on time, which ironically, you should have plenty of at this isolated resort. Overall, I liked the hotel a lot. I think that you need to come here with expectations that the hotel is more of a middle-aged Marriott than a Ritz-Carlton or JW Marriott, Etc. Finally, the resort is for couples and families with young children (under 13). I was in a large group and everyone who had teenagers, had BORED teenagers. FINAL COMMENT: If you are a honeymooner and feel that you are still the center of the universe, DO NOT COME HERE! I have read so many reviews from honeymooners who have unattainable expectations. I have a tip for the honeymooners, and it is this: On your wedding day you were the \u201cSun King\u201d and the entire galaxy revolved around you\u2026\u2026 But there is a \u201cday number 2\u201d and that is when you become one of us\u2026. The common folk. If you can accept your new reality then you will enjoy your vacation at this very nice hotel located in a beautiful setting. I am sorry my pictures are not better quality; I forgot my camera and used my phone. THE GOOD: Location is great, Ocean-front LARGE rooms with very nice Bathrooms, very friendly staff, easy check-in, in-room refrigerator. THE BAD: A little warn-down, unimpressive physical appearance, in room coffee needs to-go cups and improved condiments (the condiments consist of powdered \u201cCoffee-mate\u201d and sugar), pool is boring, like any nice resort food is expensive (be prepared). TIPS: Get some waters and half-and-half (for coffee) at the \u201cfoodland\u201d market 5 miles west of the resort, Buy a mug (either at foodland or the resort) so you can enjoy your coffee outside your room, GO TO CHOLLO\u2019S in Haleiwa! It is the best Mexican food on the island, by far! GOLFING TIP: Play the Palmer course NOT the Fazio course (it\u2019s not Tom Fazio it\u2019s George Fazio????). The Palmer is perfect the Fazio is a dog track. Play at 2pm for twilight and save $50. If you play twilight, start with the back nine then do the front nine, that way you will get all 18 in no problem. By the way I hope very much to return to this resort.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service; Very Good Conditions\u201d", "Author": "acbc1966", "ReviewID": "UR17273852", "Content": "I'm a resident of Oahu and have stayed twice at Turtle Bay within the past 18 months for a few days when visitors came from the mainland. My most recent stay was 5 nights, in the main hotel (not one of the beach bungalows. First off, the service by all staff was without parallel, and was the best I have ever received. Check-in staff was friendly, and accommodated a room change we requested (to get a better view) the evening we arrived, even AFTER we'd checked in. The food at the restaurants is a little pricey, but no more than you'd expect at a quality resort hotel, and the quality is excellent. We splurged one night dining at '21 Degrees North' and everything was wonderful. Still, decent off-site restaurants are available in Haleiwa, a 15 minute drive away, if you're on a budget. Turtle Bay sits on a gorgeous site with a beautiful beach, nice beach amenities, and other, more private beaches a short walk away. Pool looks nice, but I'm not a pool swimmer so can't speak from experience. However, there is a downside...aspects of the hotel are really showing their wear & tear, and I really noticed a deterioration since my previous stay 18 months ago. Some of the upholstery in the lobby was stained, the air conditioning outlet in our room was rusting, and the hall carpets were fraying around the edges. The kicker was when the bathroom lock in our room jammed the last evening we were there, so engineering staff had to come and forcibly remove the lock so we could gain access. Needless to say, this could not have happened at a worse time, being the last afternoon of our stay. I get the impression that ownership/management is letting things go somewhat. I suppose this is understandable, as the property is for sale, and according to local papers, if a sale doesn't occur within the next 6 months the loan holders will foreclose. Moreover, the state of Hawaii has expressed interest in purchasing the property, which complicates things. This is really a shame, because Turtle Bay is one of Oahu's best kept secrets as far as a luxury resort in a gorgeous, country location, away from Waikiki craziness. On the other hand, if you'd prefer Waikiki nightlife, Turtle Bay is not the place for you.

We flew in and drove right to our resort and were blown away by their magnificent Lobby with views of the Pacific, and open air style. This trip was for my husband and I. I had read reviews of their guestrooms and was a little scared, but it turned out to be fine. Everything else about the hotel is 4 star level, but the rooms are probably more like 3 star. But they have amazing views!! We were in room 508 and had views of the pool and the ocean. It was gorgeous! The pool view was especially at night when the tiki torches were going and the pool was glowing. It's not too noisy either because the pool closes at 8:00pm. (It's gets dark early in Hawaii we noticed..) The bed was fine, but not of the Marriot Luxe variety I love. But still adequate. The bathroom was very roomy and had a fridge and coffeemaker and sink in a separate area from the other part of the bathroom which was great for getting ready in the morning. The decor is simple but we like those straightlines and it didn't detract from the view outside. We had an oceanfront King room. It had a good sized patio and we sat out and ate breakfast a few times. The drawers that we could use to put our clothes in had a weird smell and I didn't like that. But there is a large closet with hangers. The pools are great! One big pool, one small kiddie pool. Then there is another pool that has a waterslide and waterfall in it. We liked that one a lot. All have views of the ocean. There are also two hot tubs. The grounds of the resort are SO incredibly beautiful. We loved walking around and night and getting dinner or a drink at Ola's. They have pool and beach side towel stands and a free hour of snorkling is included in your resort fee. We had so much fun snorkling so make sure you give that a try. Service was excellent. We checked out a beach cottage one day and they are beautiful. I would pay the price for one if I could get a deal, but not for the rack rate. We went just before peak season and the rates were great for all rooms. We ate at Lei Lei's which was GOOD (pricey) and Ola's which was also delicious (and more pricey). We had a bite to eat at the Bay Club one night. We bought oatmeal, cereal and milk on the way (at Foodland) and so we didn't have to fork out money for that which saved a lot. Plus we're not really big breakfast eaters. (We asked housekeeping to bring us bowls and spoons which they quickly did....good service there.) Oh, I almost forgot, they have the most wonderful turn down service which we recieved 4 out of our 6 nights. They even leave a little treat wrapped in a banana leaf and a sheet of paper telling the weather, sunrise and sunset times and activities going on for the next day. And they turn on the most relaxing music. That was so wonderful to come home too. We didn't do the spa because the prices are insane, but if you have the money, we did see the little outdoor hut that you can get massages in (they also have a full indoor spa) and that looked to die for! Right on the edge of the property next to the ocean... We ate a lot of properties off-hotel because we were trying to stay within our budget and we had a LOT of great meals. If you drive east or west you come to little towns that have great food at reasonable prices. We tried Giovanni's shrimp shack in Kahuku. Yummy! We also tried the shrimp shack just on the southern end of Haleiwa which was SOOO good (Macky's...he's the best...great service...friendly guy!). We had the lemon pepper shrimp...Oh man, my mouth is watering already. We went to Matsumoto's twice for shave ice. Try it with icecream in the bottom! Yum!! Haleiwa is a really fun little town. Lots of shopping places, restaurants and stuff. One thing to note is we shared meals a lot because the portions tended to be huge. We ordered the nachos to share at Cholos in Haleiwa and even though we shared, we still couldn't finish it. Oh, and we did the luau at the resort which was expensive and I was a little nervous if it would be worth it, but it was GREAT! The performers were from the nearby Polynesian Cultural Center and the food was very good. The show they put on was excellent and you eat outdoors, with a beautiful view of the setting sun and the ocean and foliage of the property. We LOVED it. The resort is beautiful and we would definitely go back. The northshore is such a beautiful area. We drove down to Waikiki one day and it was fun and busy and great, but we are SO glad we stayed on the northshore. It's more manageable and quiet and it's not so crowded with people and buildings so you can enjoy Hawaii's quiet peacefulness.

What we got was a pool full of screaming children, helicopters and loud golf carts driving by the beachside massage room while services were in progress, mediocre food at ridiculously expensive restaurants and a general lack of the personal touch one would expect from a four-star resort. I don't think it out of line to expect a $16 pizza and a $30 buffet not to contain a multitude of bugs. I also don't think it outrageous to expect a level of professionalism from the pool staff that doesn't include ogling guests. While their spa facilities are very nice, they are located right along a heavily traveled pathway where passers-by are free to stare at you as you sit (in absolutely nothing but a flimsy robe). Needless to say, this takes away from the relaxation element of the treatment. It would be nice to say that this was the only issue that we had with the spa facilities but sadly, it isn't. During the latter part of our treatment an hour-long yoga class was held a mere 5 meters away from where we were sitting (in the very same room). The staff is friendly and welcoming however management has clearly not encouraged them to go the extra mile for their guests. I would highly recommend bringing your own food and any potential toiletries you may require on your stay, You will find that no meal can be had for under $20. If you're a fan of the many fruits and juices available on the island, I recommend purchasing them elsewhere. Be prepared for possible (random) construction beginning before 9am and slamming doors at all hours. Also take into account that the price of any and all services delivered to your room will, in reality, cost about twice what is listed after taxes, fees and delivery charges.

The owners failed to get our key to us before we left and we had to wait for a person to get them to us who was over an hour away. When he finally did show up around 4:30 the maid still hadn't cleaned the room. This was a bit upsetting to us after traveling 12 hours and wanting to get to a place to relax and clean up before dinner. We also did not get any instructions on where the lockers were or what was in them for our use. We ended up renting snorkeling gear for 25.00 which we could have avoided if we had known. We were disappointed in the snorkeling there compared to other places we have been. The security person there at the villas also did not know how to get into the locker and had to get someone to help her. Other then these issues the villa was comfortable and quiet and the resort was beautiful. The resort does close down early with not too much night life, restaurants were closed by nine so if you plan on going out late think again.

Like everyone else we were reluctant to book with the hotel due to some of the bad reviews but it was a very nice stay. We stayed in the beach cottages (room 141) and it was beautiful. Room: If you want privacy ask for this room since it is located the furthest from the hotel (5-10 minute walk). For couples ask for a King cottage which will have a wet bar, a king bed and a little more square feet. The beach is located right in front of the cottage. There is a little backyard with a lanai, a shared hammock and where people walk thru (sometimes) to go on trails. Note there are roosters roaming around the grounds. We found them interesting at first but the early morning wake up calls got annoying. The local birds were also interesting at first but got REALLY annoying if you eat on the lanai. The room was spacious and beachy but the TV needs updating. The central air worked OK but could've been better. The room is a little dark with the lights on if you don't open the blinds completely. The bathroom was bright with a large tub and walk-in shower. Maid service was excellent and room very clean. Yes the room smells a little musty from the ocean air. We both received leis (free) and the gift basket (extra - not worth it) upon arrival as well as drinks and champagne. You get a fruit of the day everyday as well as some coconut macaroons (wrap in banana leaves) at nighttime. Food: room service was good. The seafood chowder was excellent. Palm Terrace buffet just so-so. 21 degrees was OK. Ola's was the Best of the bunch (and that would be the only dining option that is worth a repeat visit). The Sunday brunch is also worth a try. The Lua was terrible (food was poor) but entertainment OK if you want to experience one. Spa: we did the seaside couples massage and it was excellent. Spa facilities excellent. Grounds: Nice and clean. We didn't utilize the pools or hot tubes but they seemed nice. The beaches right in front of the cottages are beautiful but rocky and wavy. You have to go to either coves for a sandy beach and calmer waters. We went to the further cove past the horse stables (about 20-30 minutes walk) where absolutely no one went to (probably because of the walk) but you essentially get your own beach but it was amazing. We did that twice. Tennis courts, horse stable, golf courses we didn't use. Hotel staff were nice and friendly and the main hotel seem decent. Other: Foodland supermarket about 10-15 minute drive either way, out of the resort. Ted's bakery so-so (everyone thinks this place is good because there is nothing else on the North Shore). Shrimp trucks very good. We liked Mack's the best. Local fruits stand interesting. Starbucks also down the road. Not much dining options outside the resort on the North Shore. Can't stand the slow speed limits on the roads (45mph limit on the highways, 25-35 on roads). Polynesian Cultural Center is OK. Dole Plantation OK. Waikiki very busy. Aloa Moana shopping center is huge and beautiful (a must for shoppers). Diamond Head hike was nice. Manoa Falls hike so-so. Kayaking in Kailua was excellent.

For years we had been wanting to stay at the Turtle Bay Resort, but it always got such bad reviews that we never did, opting instead for hopping to other islands. Recently, the reviews have been getting better, so we decided to save the money and time it would take going to a different island, and give it a try, inserting it in between two stays in Waikiki. We drove up to Turtle Bay and arrived at about 2:45pm as we had some spa treatments scheduled for 3:30pm. This was the only portion of the stay that we were disappointed with, as we had booked a Beach Cottage, and it wasn't yet ready for us. We thought 3pm was a bit later than acceptable to release our room (it was still being cleaned) especially when we had booked over $1000 worth of spa packages that they knew we would be arriving for around this time. Fortunately, the Beach Cottages have their own concierge, and the gentleman who was down at the Beach Cottage area when we arrived organized everything so that he could get our luggage into our room while we were at the spa. He was very friendly and accommodating, so that sorted out that problem. The spa itself was one of the better ones I've had the pleasure to go to. There was a waiting area in an outdoor shaded patio area overlooking the gardens and sea, where you could wait between treatments. The locker room also had a steam room, something not present in enough hotels, which was lovely. The treatment staff were good and professional, and I specifically enjoyed the massage, which was excellent... not too hard, and not too soft. In fact, I had a facial, which I usually don't enjoy, and it left my face so soft that I ended up going back to enquire about the products they had used on my face and purchasing two of them. We gathered from other reviews that people who had stayed at the Beach Cottages generally wrote good reviews, while others wrote bad reviews, and we certainly weren't disappointed. I should point out a few things about these cottages. Firstly, they are not freestanding. There are 3 cottages within one structure, with the back patios separated by walls, so you do hear your neighbors a bit when they're outside. We had a rather large family with young kids staying next door, and we could certainly hear them, but not through the walls, just outside when they were on the grassy areas. I should also point out that we had a King Bed beach cottage. I believe there are kings, queens and two doubles depending on the cottage. They told us that the King Bed cottages were larger, and also have a wet bar in the living room area, which the others don't. They weren't telling a lie. Judging from the width of the rooms, our room was MUCH larger than most of those around us, so it's worth getting a King if you can. Our cottage was absolutely palatial, with the bathroom being quite large too, with a separate and VERY large tub (one of the largest I've seen... my husband is a big guy and usually doesn't fit in them, but he fit in this one), and separate toilet area within the bathroom. The bathroom was a white, beachy theme and very comfortable. We had the good fortune to meet up with the Sales Manager who showed us the two other room types available on the property. One is called Villas. The villas are brand new, and Turtle Bay manages them for the owners, so they are like condos. I have to say that if I had a large family, this would be the only option I would consider. The villas have a kitchen, VERY modern amenities, washer/dryer and up to 4 bedrooms. They are located next door to the hotel, and have their own pool and barbecue area. You can use both the villa pool plus all the hotel's regular facilities, including their beach. Don't think normal Hawaiian condo here... these are first class executive and worth staying in. As much as I liked the Beach Cottage, if I went back, I'd probably opt for one of these. Next we had a look at a few of the traditional rooms in the regular hotel building. From what I'd read on tripadvisor, I had gathered that these rooms were old and tired and somewhat moldy smelling... not very nice at all. So I was pleasantly surprised when we entered one and it was quite good really. OK, maybe not the newest or poshest room I've EVER seen, but I'd happily stay in one of these. Most of these rooms have ocean views, and are rather large, with older style but quite acceptable bathrooms. I did notice that they seemed to use air freshener to try and cover up what smelled like a bit of a moldy smell, but it really wasn't a problem for me. If you're particularly sensitive, you might not like this room, but if you're not, it would be quite fine. These rooms have either a full balcony or something called a Juliet Balcony, which is a sort of curved afterthought of a balcony, still large enough to sit on, but only just. The most recent owners added these Juliet balconies to make more of the rooms have an outside feel. The lowest level in the hotel lacks any balcony, and merely has a floor to ceiling window that opens fully, so if you want to sit outside, make sure you request not to be on the lowest floor. Other than that, I found both other types of balconies quite acceptable. The grounds of the hotel are as good as any resort on any outlying island, and the beach actually has sand, but coral if you swim out, so it's quite snorkel-able and comfortable. Again, I felt this was on par with any of the resorts on outlying islands. As far as food, we were a bit late getting around to eating the night we got there, after our spa treatments, so we went down to the Pub Style food outlet, which was very sparse and ugly and unpleasant. After a few enquiries, we found out that Lei Lei's, which is located at the golf club, was still opened, and so we got a ride in a golf cart down there. It's not far and walkable, but we saw many people catching rides to and from the restaurant in the golf cart, and they are happy to do it. Having spoke with several staff around the place, Lei Lei's seems to be considered one of the best food outlets at Turtle Bay if not on the North Shore, and our food was certainly good, and pretty good value for money. We had breakfast included in our rate, so we ate both mornings at the buffet breakfast, which has a nice view of the ocean. I would call this buffet typical of breakfast buffets. It was certainly nothing special, but did provide a good, solid morning meal, nothing wrong with it. We also ate lunch one day at the poolside bar area. Other Tripadvisor members have complained about the slow service, and I would have to agree. It took about 45 minutes to get a couple burgers, and they actually tried to bring us the wrong thing prior to getting our correct order to us. The food itself was fine but nothing special, and the service was less than average. Finally, the public lawn areas outside our Beach Cottage were very nice and faced the sunset. It was quite pleasant, and on par with some of the nicer resorts we've stayed at in Fiji. All in all, given the choice between an outlying island or a simple drive up the coast to Turtle Bay, I would definitely consider going back to this hotel again.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to relax and rejuvenate\u201d", "Author": "FreqravelerSteve", "ReviewID": "UR16076557", "Content": "Turtle Bay is a hideaway on the North Beach of Oahu.

When we arrived at Turtle Bay we were happy to see how nice it looked and how friendly everyone was. I had read some reviews about Turtle Bay and was a little nervous as to what we were in store for. We had a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool area, we had a standard room and a big lanai (the lanai was nice), the room was like I mentioned a standard room (not a 5 star room that I was hoping to get). I had read in the reviews that the rooms were dated and needed to be remodeled, that was very true. Our room had old cracked tile on the bathroom floor, it needed repainting, the carpet was a little sticky and the shower didn't have a lot of water pressure. Having said that, we were not in the room a lot so we could deal with it. It was kept clean (except I could tell that they didn't give us \"clean\" glasses, I had used on the day before and it still had my lipstick mark on it!!!). As much as we paid for the room I was just thinking that it would be a little nicer than it was. The resort is beautiful and breathtaking, the restaurants were OK, we ate at the Bay Club twice and LeiLeis once, we had a rental car, which I highly recommend because you are not close to anything, so we were able to go out to some other restaurants in other towns. There is a Foodland pretty close by, I would recommend you going there and getting some breakfast and lunch stuff because food is very expensive, even at the grocery store. The pool was nice and big, get a beach chair early because they get gone fast. You don't even have to pack a beach towel, TB will provide you with a card and you take that card to a \"towel stand\" and they will give you a beach towel and when you finished using the towel, return it to get your card back (they will charge you $25 if you loose the card). The resort charges a $20 resort fee (you get the newspaper, 1 hour snorkel gear, and some other things). The parking is terrible unless you choose valet, which is $10 a day. There is public beach parking which makes it extremely hard to park anywhere close to the resort. So needless to say, we paid for valet almost everyday. The beach area is OK, we went one time and it was kind of rocky on the bottom. We spent most of our beach time at Waimea Beach Park which has a great beach area. It is not too far away from the resort. Be sure to check out Dole Plantation, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head and drive the Kalanianaole Highway (that drive is spectacular) and eat some shaved ice.

We only had a couple of extra days to stay after the conference was over, so we decided to stay at Turtle Bay Resort on the North Shore rather than island hopping.

I think the only real difference between the \"deluxe\" and regular ocean view room is the larger balcony. The smaller balconies barely seemed to have room for the two chairs out there. The beach is beautiful, and you can snorkel right out front. (2 1-hour snorkel rentals per day are included in the \"resort fee.\" I'm not sure what else the resort fee includes.

The breakfast buffet seemed overpriced, but within the norm for this kind of hotel ($20-$25, I think). The place is about an hour from Honolulu. It's a nice drive with a lot of small beach access points along the way. Dole Plantation, Waimea Falls Park and the Polynesian Cultural Center are all close by.

We've vacationed before on Maui, Kauai, and the big island of Hawai'i, so we're no strangers to the islands and what you can expect from a hotel / resort. There are some great reviews here in TripAdvisor, and you can have a very good time at Turtle Bay, but while Turtle Bay Resort is very nice, I've got to say that it's not a four-star hotel. I went there expecting that, and I was a bit disappointed. The rooms are a bit old. Our walls could have used a cleaning or a new paint job. The tiles in our bathroom had been re-enameled at some time (they used to be pink), but the enamel was peeling in a couple of spots. The room amenities were nice, but just a bit too basic to consider this a 4 star resort. We ate primarily at Ola, and we liked the food and the service. We had dinner twice at the Palm Terrace. The first time the service was just awful. I'll pin this on the waiter, who wasn't qualified to server burgers at a fast-food restaurant. Although he was the immediate cause of the bad service, why was he there in the first place? We returned there again for a buffet, and the service was good that time (different waiter). The food at Palm Terrace was OK, but nothing special. We also tried 21 Degrees North and enjoyed both the food and the service. It wasn't as pricey as I had thought it would be. The selection of Martinis was fun and the drinks we had were tasty. Lei Lei's (at the Golf Course) was also OK, but nothing special. The food and the service was alright, but decor was totally bland. Since we spent a reasonable amount of time lounging by the pool, we also got a few lunches from the Hang 10 Bar and Grill. The Mahi-Mahi fish wraps were great. The service was good when you could get it, but the staff weren't doing the rounds of the lounge chairs very frequently. The pools were fine, and the water-slide was fun. I found the hot-tub to be way too chemical. Beyond the Hotel itself, we liked the beaches, which are so wonderfully less crowded than Waikiki where we had spent the previous few days. There are some nice walking trails, and a small sheltered swimming / snorkeling beach. Bring some good thick-soled sandals if you want to walk on the lava rock on the beach! My wife and I enjoy outdoor / nature activities. The options are much more limited on Oahu than on Maui, Kauai, or Hawai'i. We visited Waimea canyon which was very pretty, but it's a small area. We tried to get to Sacred Falls State Park (sounds nice!), but couldn't find any access to it from the road. Maybe we missed the sign. We did a nice hike to Maunawili Falls (south of Kailua). Slightly strenuous up-and-down hill, and watch out for slippery rocks when you cross the stream, which you need to do several times. I went for an unplanned swim in the stream, and a planned one at the waterfall. Nice, but nothing like the amazing waterfalls on the road to Hana on Maui. Some other notes about the North Shore. Don't plan to find too many good restaurants near Turtle Bay. You can get a plate of shrimp from numerous places between Turtle Bay and Kahuku, but restaurants are scarce. The best places we found were in Haleiwa. Banzai Sushi was great! We also had a very nice meal at Haleiwa Joe's. Go there for great sunset views (although it was too cloudy the night we went). Bottom line: We enjoyed our stay. If you want to get away from the crowds and you want to be on Oahu, this is the place.

There was good availability on the courts the ball machine is just $30/hr. The room was nice, clean and we had a great view of the ocean.

The staff was wonderful--everyone from the cleaning staff, to the restaurants to the front desk were all friendly and helpful. Keep in mind that there is not much shopping or dining in the area (the hotel's restaurants are about it), so your options are fairly limited. Haleiwa is the largest town and is about 20 min. away. I highly recommend Ola Restaurant, which is on the hotel property and overlooks the nice swimming area/beach. You may want to stop at the Foodland in Pupukea (about 10 min. from the hotel on your way in) and pick up some snacks, beer and wine for your room (all rooms have refrigerators). Snorkeling is good at Pupukea and be sure to go to Sunset and Waimea beaches. Waimea Falls Park is a nice place to visit, though the waterfall was a disappointment (only a trickle).

The first two trips were spent in Waikiki where we experienced the Hawaii that The National Tourism Industry sells. We wanted to try something new this time so we ventured to the north shore\u2019s Turtle Bay Resort. My wife and I were a little concerned of what to expect after reading some of the reviews here. We decided to go with an open mind and draw our own conclusions. What we discovered was a little slice of heaven on a pineapple. We were greeted by friendly valet and bell service. Checking in was a breeze and friendly as well. We almost felt like they had us confused with someone else because everyone was so friendly and accommodating. Come to find out, that\u2019s just the \u201cHawaiian way\u201d as friendliness comes natural on the relaxed north shore of Oahu. We booked an ocean front room (5th floor) with a large lanai, April 20-30. The room itself was basic, nice d\u00e9cor, painted walls some nice pictures, a fridge, coffee maker, desk w/2 nice chairs. The best wall of all would be the floor to ceiling glass one with the electric curtains and the sliding glass door to the lanai. We spent many hours drinking coffee on the lanai each morning/night enjoying the ocean breezes and the sound of the crashing waves below. We were lucky enough to see the whales early in our stay. We felt safe enough to sleep with our sliding glass door open each night to continue enjoying the sounds. There was a nice comfortable bed with 4 fluffy pillows. A smaller not so fluffy pillow (my preference) was found zipped up in a storage bag in the large closet on the shelf above the safe. There was a TV in a nice cabinet but we never once turned it on. The bathroom was large with a nice marble floor and a really nifty shower. There was a nice embroidered Turtle Bay stuffed turtle on our bed when we entered the room. The cost was $19.95 which seemed reasonable for a unique souvenir so we adopted him and took him home with us. The restaurants were all very good. The Palm Terrace was decent but the buffet seemed over priced. After we tried the buffet for breakfast our first day we found the coffee cart with fresh fruits and pastries in the lobby to be a better fit for us (we\u2018re not big breakfast eaters). The coffee barista\u2019s were always very pleasant. Ola\u2019s (2x) and 21 Degrees were superb. We saw Forgetting Sarah Marshall the day before we left and felt like we\u2019d been to Ola\u2019s before. Hang Ten was very good. Lei-Lei\u2019s (4x) was the absolute best! These guys are on their game and hitting the ball long and straight down the fairway. Located on the golf course, this has to be one of the best places to eat on the island. Everything we tried on our visits (all dinner) was not just good but great! Caesars dressing has to be made from scratch, we loved it. Hint: save room for desert afterwards. The valet offers golf cart service to carry you to and from Lei-Lei\u2019s. Let the waiter know you\u2019re ready to leave when he brings you the check and your chariot awaits before your done paying the bill. If you decide to walk from/to the hotel, it\u2019s not that far away and a very romantic stroll. We ate lunch on the north shore almost every day. There\u2019s a terrific spot 8-10 miles down the east shore called The Tropic\u2019aina Bar & Grill with a couple hundred orchids throughout the very pretty garden and lots of tropical caged birds. Shrimp trucks scatter the north shore. We liked the \u201cAloha Chef\u201d best but every one of them were good. Just read the signs on the trucks, they all claim to be #1 or they\u2019re world famous! A stop by Ted\u2019s Bakery was in order almost every day too. You\u2019ll pass it on the way to the hotel from the airport, make a mental note to yourself. The Machedamia nut cream pie was awesome. The shops/boutiques on the property had nice selections and were not over priced which was a pleasant surprise. There\u2019s plenty of shopping in Hale\u2019iwa and also down the east side of the island in small shops scattered along the road. You won\u2019t find Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Gucci or Armani. but that suited us perfectly, that\u2018s not why we went to the island. The Polynesian Cultural Center is about 4 miles down the eastern shore and worth a stop. You\u2019ll find a plethora of shops inside the PCC. The weekly luau at Turtle Bay was sold out to a realtors convention on the Friday we were there so we took in the luau at the PCC. Very nicely done with a great show afterwards. . We enjoyed the hotel pool and the snorkeling in the bay was also very nice. There is lots of lava rock on the beach to the west of the hotel., wear sandals if you head this way. This is the best place to watch the turtles in the evening. It\u2019s a good idea to stay on or close to the horse trail (watch your step, LOL!) It\u2019s a romantic walk along the shore and through the tropical vegetation. You\u2019ll see a small tree on the lava rock peninsula and this is where the turtles like to hang out at dusk. The east side bay is mostly sandy but still, watch your step. There was a N-NW swell while we were there so we got to watch the surfers at Sunset, Banzai and Rocky Point. We also enjoyed some body surfing ourselves at Pounders (about \u00bd- \u00be mile past the PCC). Some big waves were there after the N-NW swell passed through making the name of the beach obvious. There\u2019s 8-10 beautiful beaches on the east shore that you can find yourself all alone at times. Be careful of thieves, just because you\u2019re on vacation doesn\u2019t mean the bad guys are too. The helicopter ride was incredible and worth it. The day we scheduled our ride was windy so we swayed quite a bit during our ride. The pilot wasn\u2019t bothered by the wind so we didn\u2019t worry (too much). If you\u2019re a golfer, I couldn\u2019t imagine a nicer place to stay. The hotel charged $9.95 a day for parking. That may seem a little high but after we parked for 3 hours and 10 minutes at The Hilton Hawaiian Village to the tune of $24.50, that made $9.95 a day seem like a bargain. We couldn\u2019t wait to get away from Waikiki and back to the north shore To sum it up, we\u2019ll give Turtle Bay a solid 5* rating. What they offer in hospitality and surroundings can\u2019t be compared any where on the island. We understand that you just can\u2019t make everyone happy hence some of the negative comments. Basically, if you\u2019re looking for the \u201cRoyal Treatment\u201d try the Royal Hawaiian. If you\u2019re looking for the \u201cHawaiian Treatment\u201d head to Turtle Bay, you won\u2018t be disappointed.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Turtle Bay!\u201d", "Author": "malia311", "ReviewID": "UR15478964", "Content": "I'm from Honolulu but this was my first time staying at Turtle Bay.

If you're looking for busy, and shopping, this is your place. Envision Las Vegas Strip on a beach. Anyhow, this all leads to us checking out and driving the the North Shore, with no reservations. We arrived at Turtle Bay, and told Sonja our story. Know that if you want to stay at the North Shore, Turtle Bay is pretty much it, unless you find a house to rent. Anyhow, fortunately for us, they had vacancy, as we did not call ahead. We were originally quoted a room of $330/night, and when we grimaced, she said \"oh, wait a minute\" and furiously typed for 5 minutes and found us a deluxe ocean view room for $200/night. You should know this is NOT a new hotel. If your looking for a sparkling new room with a flat screen and fancy surroundings, it is not here. However, you will find spacious rooms, large bathroom which is well kept and clean. They even have cotton balls and Q-tips in the bathroom. There is a refrigerator in the room. As I said,we had an ocean front room which was wonderful, We could see the whales and the surfers from our balcony. All the staff was fantastic! Everyone we dealt with was friendly and knowledgeable, and seemed to enjoy their job. The pool is very nice, not a small area but not huge. It has a great tiki type bar, with very friendly bartenders. We did not eat there, so I don't know about the food. It was very busy. I had a hard time finding a chair on one day. There are several restaurants on site, and there are several other good places to eat on the North Shore, but you have to drive about 20 minutes to get to them. Unfortunately, the restaurants weren't the highlight of the trip. We love to go to eat and try new places, and even though the restaurants weren't my favorite, I would definately stay here again. We ate the always overpriced breakfast buffet, and while the service was great, the food was not. Much better to go to Ted's Bakery (which is about a 10 minute drive and a local favorite) 21, their $$$ restaurant, was very good, but it is quite expensive. Ono was a mixed batch for us.

They maintain the back 9 like they do the Palmer course. Apparently, both courses are about to undergo a complete makeover. Could the resort use some updating? Yes.

The Sharper Image radio was set to special music that just gave you that feel of the islands. Very nice touch. Room view was amazing as you can see in the photos. Grounds were beautiful. I didn't really travel around outside the resort since I was there to watch the pageant and special Hawaiian Tropic luau. The bar area was great and the food out by the pool area was good too. It does get pretty windy here and the surf is constant. Saw a lot of surfers both days. The resort is on the North Shore so the shuttle from Honolulu took about an hour. But the drive is nice and the scenery is breathtaking! Again, I was only there two nights and was only there for an event and stop over for Maui but I had a great time just sitting by the pool and enjoying the scenery!", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutley Beautiful\u201d", "Author": "krissssyg", "ReviewID": "UR14917456", "Content": "Staying on the North Shore was the best decision by far once we pulled into Turtle Bay the day we arrived! Your far enough away from Waikiki and Honolulu tourists, but still close enough to get there in less than an hour if you have a car. Turtle Bay is breathtaking, hidden on the northern peninsula with beautiful scenery that I have ever seen. we arrived off our plane with lei's and went to tpick up our rental car, which you really need to get around Oahu. We spent ten days there and loved it. It has 6 restaurants at the resort, outside bar, relaxing spa, surfboard/bike/bookey board rentals, scuba diving lessons, two pools, one with a slide, and two hot tubs. You can surf right outside the hotel , just careful of the rocks , pretty shallow but you can surf right there with the sea turtles. The restaurants there can be pricey but it depends on what you eat. My boyfriend and I spent an average of $100 a night at the restaurants there and when we ate at 21 North it was a bit more expensive since its the top rated gourmet restaurant in Oahu. Lunch by the pool can cost anywhere between $25-30 easy. There is a Foodland grocery story on your way to Turtle Bay, and I suggest you stop and pick up a few things to have in your room to save some money. THey have complimentary coffee in your room and at night they do a turn down service with the oh so good macaroons wrapped in leaves. they forgot to turn it down two days in a row, so make sure you call down and have them deliver the cookies, its worth it. We were a little disappointed with the Lua at the resort. We were expecting to see the pig in the ground, but ended up having hte pork via buffet style and never saw the pig. the dancing and food was delicious, but we were expecting the pig! Make sure you go to Kualoa Ranch and do the 2 hour atv tour, best attractions there where you can see sets from Jurassic Park, Pearl Harbor, and Lost, etc and ride through the beautiful mountains. Def try jumping off the rock at Waimea Bay and venture into Honolulu to see the Pearl Harbor exhibit. Take a day or so and drive into Haliewa, cute little historic town about 15 minutes away with lots of shopping and great places to eat that are way more reasonable. the surf shop there is great, Surf & Sea, we did our scuba diving there and they were really nice. PIpeline was a sight to see but we found out that the big waves come in the winter, so we were a bit saddened we didnt the big kahunas but the waves were still big and I suggest you see it. Be sure to wear plenty of sun tan lotion and have a mai-tai. I would go back in a second!

When we arrived, the bell captain was very friendly and showed us to our room which had a beautiful oceanfront view. The room was decent size but seemed a bit worn for the price. We ate at the expensive restaurant in the hotel (can't remember the name now). The food and service were and waiter were good. The BAD: Before we arrived at the hotel, we had heard locals talking in town that they were expecting a huge storm that night. However, I didn't hear anything from management of the hotel warning guests, and the wind appeared to be calm when we arrived. That night, a massive storm (probably in years) hit and we had water coming into our room as the sliding glass door for some reason is not watersealed at the top. I called the front desk and asked them to send maintenance up. However, 5 minutes later, power went down in the entire resort, so of course maintenance never came. The next morning, we didn't receive any info from management explaining what was going on. I tried asking the front desk, but they basically had a skeleton crew working who was just as uniformed as the rest of us. I explained about the water leakage and they said they would send maintenance but again they never came. She said when she called maintenance that they were aware that certain side of the building has water that comes in. I found it odd that they seemed unconcerned about any water/mildew damage as a result. The front desk didn't know when power was going to be up and they said as a result all the restaurants were closed except they had one buffet open, so we really had no choice but to eat there. The buffet was mainly cold cuts/bread/water/a few hot dishes and a few desserts. However, I thought it shocking that management was charing $17 per guest when they should have just given the food for free given what a bad experience the guests were going through and the limited food/drink. I felt like management was taking advantage of the guests not having any other place to go. When I took the elevator down to the lower level, there was one letter posted from management about the storm and power outage but again no details. I just find it odd in the age of cell phones, that management couldn't have called a news station and provided info that they posted in the lobby for guests to be informed. In addition, when I went back to the room, the water was cold in the shower. Again I asked the front desk and they said it had to do with the power outage, but that didn't make sense since they use gas to powere the hot water. Anyhow, so I had a cold shower and had to air dry my hair. I also asked if they were going to be passing out flashlights and they said they would. Well, they didn't and as it got dark, I had to call housekeeping to get flashlights. Again, I felt like guests were completely on their own to fend for themselves. Well, power finally came on at 8pm at night, thank god. Anyhow, it was a horrible experience, and the next day, there was a letter from management posted at the elevator that didn't really apologize for anything, just explained that we had survived the power outage. To make things worse, when we checked out, they tried to charge us the $20 resort fee. I explained to them, that I had booked through hotels.com and was told the price I paid included everything and was also told this upon check in. They said they needed my credit card only for incidentals yet they were now trying to charge me. I asked why I should be charged when it was so windy outside that we couldn't use the resort amenities and the power was out in the room so the safe/coffee machine could not be used. Finally, he agreed to charge me for half. I explained I shouldn't even have to pay for the 1st night due to the water coming in the room and he said I have to talk to hotels.com about that. I just couldn't believe how cheap the resort was and how in a crisis, management is non-existent and completely lacking any plan or customer service skills. I plan to write a formal letter to hilton corporation about the experience.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sedona, AZ", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous Place to Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "sedonagirl99", "ReviewID": "UR14273734", "Content": "Just got back from a ten day Hawaii vacation, spending six nights at the Turtle Bay resort, and I absolutely loved my experience there! I booked a king ocean front room on the resort's website and paid $237 -- $243 per night (the higher rate for Fri & Sat). I found the room comfortably large but felt the furnishings were very ordinary -- not that it mattered. From the small juliet balcony of Room 351, I had a breath-taking view that overlooked the tropical grounds of the resort, public beach areas, nearby mountains and the endless crashing waves. I slept with the balcony door open so I could hear the sound of the surf --- I can't remember when I have slept so deeply and peacefully. A gentle sunset greeted me every morning. Mornings on the balcony were pleasant but the winds that came in the afternoons made it a bit chilly to sit out there without long sleeves. But, from my balcony, I saw a whale break the surface of the water in the near distance and that was truly exciting! I ate at all the resort's restaurants (with the exception of Lei Lei's) and very much enjoyed the food. I laughably budgeted $50 per day for meals but was at least $30-$50 off that amount if I wanted to eat three meals a day. I found most restaurant employees to be friendly and helpful, with the exception of a couple of servers at Hang Ten by the pool, when it got really busy during lunch and at sunset. Since I was traveling solo (an oddity in Hawaii, I discovered), I sometimes felt like I got second-level treatment, especially by male servers. However, I especially want to compliment the Bay Club, which I think is one of the more over-looked hospitality spaces. The service was excellent, the food a little lighter fare and the bartenders were the best in the hotel! I visited the spa on two occasions -- once for a lomi lomi massage and the other time for a pinapple pedicure. Both treatments were enjoyable but I consider the spa itself to be unimpressive. Coming from Aizona, I've visited some of the best spas in Scottsdale and Sedona and this one didn't measure up. Also, the spa charges an 18% service charge and I couldn't get a clear answer from the spa receptionists about how much of that went to the therapists. Fortunately, the young woman who gave me my massage told me the split is 15% to therapist and 3% overhead to the spa itself. One reason I picked Turtle Bay was for the horse-back riding. I went on the 50-minute trail ride ($50), the 80-minute evening ride ($80), and a private 7:30 am ride ($100) where I got to trot and lope when appropriate. I would definitely recommend the latter two rides -- they were great fun and I got to see a lot of different landscapes. And I think the regular trail ride probably is the best choice for inexperienced riders. Kudos to the house-keeping staff who were always friendly and very sensitive to guests' schedules. When I was taking a nap a couple of afternoons, they honored the do-not-disturb sign on my door and left a card under the door telling me to call when I was ready to have my room cleaned. I noticed there was staff on the floor as late as 9pm -- unusual in most hotels I've stayed at. My floor had three washers and dryers in a room by the ice-maker. That was very convenient but a little pricey. $2.50 each for the washer and dryer and $1 each for detergent and fabric softener if you didn't bring your own. Even so, the machines were very busy, especially at night. I have only two minor complaints about my stay: (1) I had some difficulty accessing yahoo email on the computers in the business office -- it had something to do with the filtering system that the hotel uses and I found the whole issue quite irritating, and (2) unless you used valet parking, it was quite a hike to the parking lot if you were carrying anything heavy or awkward -- plus, someone ripped the canvas on the convertible top of my rental car and I have no idea what the car rental company may charge me for that little bit of vandalism. I hope that Turtle Bay's proposed future development is squashed because I think the area is developed sufficiently now and would hate to see some of forests where I went horse-back riding disappear. The governor has proposed that the state buy the property and I can't help but wonder what that might mean as far as the hotel is concerned. We all know what kind of quality service governments tend to offer, or how disappointing contracted-out services can be. Oh well, I'm sure my next visit to the Turtle Bay Resort will happen well before any of those political issues are laid to rest.

The room rate worked out to be around $250/night. A business associate in Honolulu advised us we'd be happy at that price; the complaints seem to be from people paying much more than that. We enjoyed our 4 night stay at Turtle Bay very much. We arrived at Honolulu airport and picked up a rental car for the drive out to the North Shore, stopping at Costco for supplies (just off H-2). We also stopped in Haleiwa for snacks, since it was on the way. Once arriving at the resort, we were warmly greeted by the valet and bell staff. (It's $10/day to valet park. Self-parking is no charge and the lot is not that far from the hotel.) The front desk staff were also friendly and welcoming. We reserved a deluxe oceanfront king room and were assigned room 603 (East Tower, top floor, 2nd room from the elevator). We thought we would have a full balcony, but the balcony was barely big enough for the 2 chairs that were there. We noticed other rooms with larger chairs & larger balconies. We were going to request a room change, but the view was so spectacular,looking over the swimming beach, that we decided to stay where we were. We could hear the waves crashing even up 6 floors and slept with the sliding door open. Plus, we took some amazing sunrise photos, and saw whales playing out in the ocean every afternoon. The room itself was clean & nicely decorated, large bathroom, a separate sink and large closet in the dressing area, which also had a small refrigerator, safe and coffee maker. We noticed the plaster on the ceiling was \"bubbled\" in a few places (maybe a leak or maybe from too many visitors leaving the sliding door open?) We were very comfortable. We had breakfast in the Palm Terrace, but ordered from the menu and not the $24 buffet. The food looked great but we would have been hard-pressed to eat $24 worth of food to make it worth our while. Dinner at Ola's on the beach was delicious as was lunch and dinners at Lei Lei's on the golf course (with the best service of any of the places, however, no view). We also had drinks and lunch at the Hang Ten bar by the pool. Again, no complaints. There is a controversy between the resort and the governor, who wants to take over the 880 acres, which has resulted in some travel booking sites not to carry the resort on their inventory.

I never saw a \"bad\" beach on Oahu; in my opinion, they have some of the best beaches anywhere. We stayed in the Ocean Front Cottages for 4 nights. We were in building 110, just feet from the beach. We had a hammock right outside our room. The room was clean and spacious. I loved the wood floors. The bed was firm and comfy, and the pillows semi flat, which I prefer. The TV was small, but it was OK. The bathroom was luxurious and spacious. I loved the shower, and the separate toilet was nice. There was some rust from hard water on the sink. Other than that, I found no flaws. We had a lot of traffic going thru the back yard from other cottage and beach goers. I liked keeping all the blinds open with the screens, listening to the waves and letting in fresh air, so everyone could easily see in our room. At night we closed the door and curtains. The parking here was a bit of a problem. We had to park across the street several lots away due to no parking spaces available a couple of times. We ate at the golf course several times, and found it to be good and reasonable compared to Hawaii standards. Expensive food and daily resort fees of $20 is a common thread in Hawaii. We found the breakfast buffet to be barely OK. For what you paid, it's not worth it. We golfed the 2 courses, and found them to be nice but disappointing. We expected ocean views, and only one hole actually had an ocean view on the green. The rest of the places we golfed had ocean views on almost every hole. We did the horseback ride (90 minutes @ a walk, great for green cowpokes) with another couple, and enjoyed it. Cost is $80 each. The island of Oahu has a lot of poverty and some deplorable conditions, both of which you'll see on your trip from the airport as you arrive to Turtle Bay. This island has the pipeline for surfers, some of the best surfing anywhere, so be prepared for cars parked along the roads, and a lot of locals, kids, hippies, tourists and riffraff. The locals play on weekends, too, so be prepared for crowds. We did the Memorial on Sat. morning, arriving @ 7 am, and had to wait in line about 45min. It opens @ 7:30. There are cruise ship tours arriving at about 7:15 or so by bus load. The actual tour took about 3 hours. We did the Arizona and Missouri. This is not to be missed in my opinion. Bring your kleenex. We saw no whales (I'm an avid whale watcher) but saw hundreds in Maui after we left. The surf was high and rough, so they're hard to spot @ Turtle Bay. We took a couple of island drives in our jeep. We didn't have the top off the jeep the whole time due to rain. One of our tee times was canceled due to heavy rain. The conciarge service was fantastic. Our calls were returned within 3 minutes each time we required their services. We got spoiled with the filled ice twice a day, cookies on our pillow every night (except the first night???) and fresh fruit daily. The toiletries were OK. I'm pretty picky; I like my own from home. I'm not into fruit smells or peppermint. I also never used the tub, so I cannot comment on this.

We had the chef's pairing where each course is paired with wine. Wonderful! As it should be for $110 per person. The moral is: if extra money was paid for it then very above average.

We chose an ocean front king room and we were rewarded with a great view of the ocean from a small balcony. The higher priced deluxe ocean front rooms overlooked both ocean and pool area and had a larger balcony, but we were not at all disappointed with our choice. The room was huge, spotlessly clean and attractively decorated. Amenities included a small fridge, coffee maker, iron, etc. We had a lovely dinner at the hotel restaurant, 21 Degrees North, where we were given a window table and presented with a complimentary dessert honoring our anniversary. We later dined at another of their restaurants, Ola, which is equally good, and which is situated right on the beach. We also had lunch at both Lei Lei's at the golf shop and Hang Ten bar at the pool. All the food was tasty and well presented, although one should be aware that everything in Hawaii is more expensive than on the mainland. Since we aren't big breakfast eaters, we bought fruit, yogurt and juice at the nearby Foodland, stored it in the fridge, and avoided the pricey breakfast buffet. We also enjoyed the Friday night luau which, unfortunately, had to be brought indoors because of showers. The entertainment was excellent although the buffet dinner was mediocre. Still, the $85 pp tickets were worth it to us. The resort itself has two professional golf courses, the Arnold Palmer on which championship tournaments are played, and the Fazio course which is a bit more forgiving and which my husband enjoyed thoroughly. In addition, we walked several marked trails and later watched a glorious sunset over the water from just outside the Sunset Room. Besides the nice pool for swimming and/or lounging, there is access to the ocean where one can surf right at the resort. Outside the resort, just a few miles away, are the world famous surfing areas where the very big waves come in during the winter. Honolulu is just over an hour away by car -- a little more during rush hours -- so we were able to go there to visit the Arizona Memorial, the Missouri, and Waikiki Beach. We purchased a package from Orbitz, giving us 5 nights at the resort and a mid-size car (upgraded to a full size by Alamo) for 5 days, for a total of $1388, or approximately $278 per day for room and car. Frankly, I would hesitate to pay rack rate for the room which is in the $300+ range, but packages seem to be available from several sources.

Out on a windy point in the rural North Shore, the hotel and its many restaurants sit on an expansive property with amazing ocean views. Turtle Bay Resort is not a five star luxury resort, so don't be fooled when you book your stay. It's missing a few things, but if you can overlook some minor faults, you'll be rewarded with a relaxing stay on the North Shore. The property is incredible and the rooms are spacious, clean and well-decorated. Watch out - the resort charges a $20 per day \"resort fee\" that covers parking, wireless internet and snorkeling. They don't inform you of the fee when you check in, it only says on a printed card in your room that you will be charged a \"modest fee\" each day. The best part about the resort is the miles of walking trails along beautiful untouched beaches. A morning walk with a cup of Kona coffee in hand is a great way to start the day. The best place to \"beach yourself\" is the sandy beach on a protected cove adjacent to the hotel. The beach is small, but the cove has a soft, sandy bottom and is great for swimming. While beautiful, the resort's location makes the property very windy. The pool area was so windy we couldn't lay by the pool or enjoy a drink/food at the poolside bar. Eating at the resort can be a little challenging. There are several restaurants that serve expensive food that doesn't vary too much between restaurants. Expect to pay between $20-$50 per entree, no matter what you order. Ola, by the beach, is the best bet. Close to the crashing surf, the atmosphere far exceeds that of the resort's other restaurants. Lei Lei's, by the golf course, is also good. Again, both places are expensive. To save money, you can shop at the nearby Foodland grocery store (a few miles down the road in Sunset Beach) and stock your fridge with breakfast and lunch snacks. If you want a short drive to dinner, the shrimp shacks in Kahuku are amazing. The dinner is messy - and the meal is prepared in a questionable old truck - but it's worth it. Try Giovanni's Original White Shrimp Truck.

Photos included of the cottage 141 which is furthest from the hotel. We called a week in advance of our arival and requested our room be close to the water and far from the hotel and received exactly that. The room had a king size bed which was quite comfortable, light weight down comforter, plenty of feather bed pillows. Closet was well stocked with more pillows (hyop alergenic) and more blankets which were great for use in the hammock right out side the room. Robes and slippers and an inroom safe. Free wifi, (my computer hooked up effortlessly). Bathroom was well done, Very clean and spacious, plenty of towels in all sizes, lighted mirror, hair dryer and plenty of outlets for phone chargers and camera chargers. Thow open the large slider doors and let the sound of waves sooth your spirit. Lanai has ocean view, chairs, rocker and table for outdoor relaxation and a hammock is just a few feet away with ocean view. Staff: Service was excellent, from the concierge who greeted us and explained the services we would receive. Maid service daily, early newspaper, turn down service at night, which included home made cookie snacks wrapped in coconut leaves (nice touch), fresh ice twice a day and fruit of the day, usually exotic fruit. Room service was excellent all but one night (our last and a Friday night before a big golf tournament when it was 45 minutes late). The breakfast buffet was good its cheaper to order off the menu but it still comes from the buffett, Ola's excellent, Palm terrace good, We skipped 21 and Lei lei's based on reviews we read here. Location: The North shore can't be beat. Honolulu was big city noisy and stress full. The drive to the North shore is refreshing and what Oahu is all about. Beatuiful clean beaches, great waves. We rented a car as part of the vacation package and drove around the island twice. It's easy to get around, people are friendly and the food is great no matter where you go.

It was an absolutely perfect stay. We had never been to Hawaii before and friends of our recommended Turtle Bay to us. We arrived on a Saturday evening after 12 hours of flight time. The drive up to the North Shore was beautiful. After you pass Haleiwa, you start to see the ocean on your left. Beautiful views as the sun was beginning to set. We arrived at Turtle Bay and the view in the lobby was wonderful. They have huge glass windows that overlook the beach. I had read prior postings that the views are much better from the higher floors. Unfortunately I forgot about this upon check-in and we were given a room on the second floor. The view from the room wasn't great so I called down to the front desk and asked if we could switch to a higher floor. They said they were sold out on Saturday night but would move us on Sunday. Sure enough, we received a phone call from the front desk Sunday afternoon saying we could move to a room on the 6th floor. We did and the view was amazing! The grounds of the hotel were beautiful and we enjoyed walking on the trails that they have. We also did a horseback ride at the hotel that was a lot of fun. A rental car is a must if you are staying on the North Shore so that you can go exploring. We went to the Waimea Falls Audubon center one day which is about 15 minutes away. It's a nice walk up to a waterfall where you can go in for a swim. Beautiful flowers on the walk up and a very peaceful place. We also enjoyed Waimea Bay beach. Again, stunning views. We were there just as the high surf season was kicking off so the surf wasn't that big yet. The town of Haleiwa is also a great place to explore. We had lunch there a couple of days and did some shopping. We found the help at Turtle Bay to be awesome. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The only issue is there are a lack of dining options in the area. You are pretty much limited to the hotel unless you want to drive to Haleiwa, about 20 minutes away. We did have lunch at the pool one day(good), dinner at Ola's(very good) and Lei Lei's (not so good). There is also a coffee stand in the lobby that is a great place to get coffee and muffins, pastries, etc in the morning. There is a Foodland supermarket 10 minutes away that will make sandwiches and has salads etc. so we picked up lunch there one day and brought it to the beach. Also picked up snacks there for the room. We went to Waikiki one day and couldn't believe how hectic it was.

We took a trip to England and Paris last summer and booked every hotel based on Trip advisor recommendations. This worked out beautifully. So I searched for remote Oahu hotels and avidly read about the Turtle Bay Resort. The reviews were mixed. Some felt very under-served and others seemed to love their visit. We contacted a friend who lived in Hawaii and she supported the positive reviews. We were very glad she did. We had a 6 night visit to a wonderfully unpretentious but very affable and fulfilling Hotel. We stayed in a beach front Cottage - with the surf just tens of feet from out front veranda. That alone was an escape. The Hotel is almost as far away from Honolulu as you can get. And despite having a fine golf course - a good spa and a very good range of restaurants. The location was totally escapist. Empty beaches to ramble away from the hotel core for miles. Service was friendly -- and didn't run on \"island time\". While there we also made a point of looking at three different room styles that the hotel offers in it's main 6 story building. While some reviewers had complained of poor quality - what we saw were renovated and very acceptable rooms. We would recommend the higher the better for view purposes. With or without balcony's is a cost change. But has a value. We hit winter wave season. Which meant the ocean views where spectacular. Nearby beaches had many surfers. The hotel had a small safe beach. While the others were too wild for swimming. But he hotels pool was wells sized. Our gold standard for Hawaii hotels has always been the Mani Lani Bay on the Big Island. An expensive but very cool spot, which we have been to at least 7 times.

Oh boy do I have a lot to warn you about and brag about. First we rented a Pikaki Jr. Suite (apparently \"Jr\" means KIDS not smaller). So when we arrive for our HONEYMOON (which we had called ahead and let the hotel know that was our purpose for staying - hoping for a little extra service) we arrive to our room to find it VERY small and drab (big balcony though) with a stuffed animal on the bed (which you have to buy for $20!) Disapointed but feeling like there was nothing we ould do about it we began to get undressed (it's almost 11pm and we had an 8 hr flight) right in the middle of undressing house keeping WALKS RIGHT IN ON US. No knock, nothing. After they left I went to lock the door and I stepped on the carpet infront of the AC and it was SOAKED. I immediatly called the front desk and insisted they do something, \"after all, it's our honeymoon.\" Promptly they agreed to move us and sent the bell boy up. The bell boy came, gave us the new room key and then walked away, he didn't even help us with our bags! When we finally found the other room - on our own, we went in... another Pikake Jr. suite.. but this one had a TINY balcony, much smaller than the last with barely enough room to fit 2 chairs. Very mad with the bellboy situation and now feeling like we got DOWNGRADED I called the desk again and the man was very kind and offered to move us yet again, adding \"You won't be dissapointed.\" The bell boy comes, this time helps us, and leads us to \"The best-view room in the hotel\" Our new room was the \"Maile\" which is the 2nd best room there (2nd only to the Ali'l Presidential Suite\". Now THIS was better. Same size bedroom but now we had an adjoining living room/dining room plus 2 bathrooms and 2 HUGE balconies. (This is what I had originally expected for paying nearly $500/night!) So there is the first part of our experience, horrible but a great end result.... moving on.... (OH, and since the hotel sits on a penninsula, every room has an ocean view) EXPENSES: This is a pricey hotel, and everything costs $, even the water in your room is $3/bottle if you choose to drink it. I recommend going to Wal-Mart (There is only 1 on the island) and buying your own drinks/snacks to stock the fridge with. (Also maybe your own shampoo since theirs is very drying.) DONT FORGET THERE IS A $20.00/DAY RESORT FEE. That's right, when you check out you will recieve a bill for $20 every day you were there (For us that ended up being $100!!!) This is suppose to cover self-parking, 1 snorkel rental per day for 1 hour, a newspaper, and wi-fi. You get charged this even if you do not use the services. Room service is extremely expensive, breakfast for two was $45. Dinner was $115 (and that was us trying to eat cheap.) The Turtle's Den is a better option for breakfast/snacks (It's a cart down in the lobby.) The Lobby is great, awesome view and beautiful decor. Don't buy postcards, the front desk will give you some for free and they will mail them (This is the only free thing you get!) 21 Degrees North, hoity toity resteraunt in the hotel, great for dinner - only $110 for two and that was us not trying to eat cheap; Reservations are REQUIRED. Lastly, I would take advantage of the 1 hr/day snorkel rental since you get charged for it anyway, we did and it really was neat on the beautiful Turtle Bay beaches... high tide kept us pretty close to shore though. DISASTER: We went December 2 and stayed a week, during which time a record breaking storm hit the island. Power went out @ the Resort for TWO DAYS!!! No AC, no nothin'. What sucked the worst was the first day the police would not let anyone travel b/c of powerlines in the road so we were stuck in the resort. The staff tried very hard to be helpful, but I think they could have done better. For example, with everyone stuck, no AC, no lights, you would think they would at least provide you food or drinks or knock off the resort fee...NO. (We eventually did get the resort fee knocked off one day but we had to argue with them a lot.) Since you had to eat their that day they did a buffet and all they had was food like breakfast : cereal, toast, coffee, eggs, bacon, juice, danishes, donuts (until they ran out) and lunch: beef scewers, fish/rice, sandwich stuff, rolls, coffee, water (until they ran out) and they charged us $30 for (2)brkfst, and $60 for (2) lunch!!!!! OUTRAGEOUS considering the circumstances!! The Humidity is awful when there is no AC so everyone tried to stay outside, but since this happened the last 2 days we were @ the resort it was not a pleasant memory. Neither was having to lug all our suitcases down the stair well 4 flights in the dark by ourselves. NORTHSHORE: This hotel is GREAT for a true Northshore experience, stunning views and unbeatable surroundings, but just expect to feel a little jyped on the price and level of service. We went into Honolulu/Waikiki and compared to other Hotels this one absolutely LOOKS more like Hawaii, everywhere else is SOOOO Touristy and you feel like you are in Japan, not Hawaii. NorthShore is considered \"the country\" so it is secluded and romantic, however if you have any events booked you will likely have to drive clear accross the island to Honolulu/Waikiki to do them. A CAR RENTAL IS A MUST!! We booked events through expedia like a dinner cruise (horrible, overbooked), a submarine tour (got canceled due to weather-refunded), a scuba catamaran (got canceled due to weather-refunded), and a luau - pretty cool-decent food - loooong show. There is not much to do in NorthShore, and the homes are delapatated, but the natural beauty is stunning -great place for waves too because it is the windiest point on the island. Great sand, Great clear/blue waters. Pearl Harbor is a must see, we were there on the anniversery of it - increadible (get there before 2, tours sell out). ALL AND ALL: I would not go back. We have stayed at many resorts and this one, were it not for the perfect location, would rank @ the very bottom. Catch 22, if we DID go back I would probably would stay here again, but only because the options are pretty limited. If you rule out turtle Beach talk to people who have been to other resorts there and find the best one possible - if it is less than 4 star it will be a DUMP as much of Oahu is now overpopulated, over-toured, dirty and over priced.

We booked our 3rd floor Deluxe guestroom through Hotwire for $258/night + resort fee and taxes...a nice discount off what the resort quoted me. (Although Hotwire does not reveal the name of the hotel until after you've committed to the purchase, in this instance it's easy to be confident that it will be Turtle Bay Resort because there are no other \"4-star\" hotels in Kahuku, Oahu! However, a cautionary note--if you book through Hotwire, Priceline, or a similar discounter, be sure to call the resort well before arrival and confirm your reservation details. I'm glad I did, because I learned that Turtle Bay expected us to arrive a week later than what we'd reserved. Fortunately, we were able to straighten that out before we got there. At least they admitted that it was their error and that the paperwork from Hotwire was correct.) Our room was spacious, and the bathroom was possibly the largest hotel bathroom I've seen. It's true, as others have mentioned, that the Deluxe guestrooms do have some wasted space--there would be plenty of room to add a loveseat/small sofa--but it wasn't an issue for us. The room was spotless clean and, unlike what some other reviewers have experienced, the furniture did not look weathered. In fact, we did not have any of the accomodation problems reported by some reviewers. The bathroom fixtures could have used some updating, but again it wasn't an issue for us. Based on earlier reviews we read here, we chose not to dine at Ola or at 21 Degrees North, and we avoided the overpriced breakfast buffet. Instead, we ate breakfast and dinner at Lei Lei's Bar & Grill at the golf course, less than a 5 minute stroll from the main resort building. The food there was excellent and fairly priced (especially relative to what Ola and 21 Degrees charge) and the service was attentive. Perhaps this is because, as we were told, Lei Lei's is located on the resort but is not owned by the resort? In any event, the Double Cut Pork Loin Chop was one of the best pork loin chops I've ever had (and we know pork in North Carolina!). Overall, we had a very nice stay at Turtle Bay and definitely would return. Is it worth $450+ night, as many report paying? Probably not--very few places are in my opinion. But we paid significantly less than that, and at the lower price point we enjoyed, the Turtle Bay experience definitely was worth it.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "DZA_A", "ReviewID": "UR12344217", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights in August in a Junior Suite. I will state firstly that we did not prebook this hotel as we had made reservations at the Hyatt in Waikiki, but ended up not staying there even one night as their rooms were not satisfactory (I can't do carpet in the bathroom, but that is another review). We were in a desperate situation as other hotels were all fully booked, so we ended up here. We thought it would be ok based on the website. We were disappointed. However, it was better than the Hyatt. And it was a more relaxing location than Waikiki. This place was not really our cup of tea. We usually stay in 4 or 5 star hotels around the world (we travel frequently) , but prefer exclusive, boutique style hotels. Our preference generally is not hotels with hundreds or thousands of rooms that 'cater to the masses'. Turtle Bay Resort caters to the masses. Pump them in, pump them out. And the price is not that expensive so the hotel guests tend to be of an average quality, those not really looking for exclusivity. I have rated it 3 stars and not 2 or 1 mainly because the golf course was magnificent. My husband and I and our young son played golf a couple of times and really enjoyed ourselves. Also, the restaurant at the golf course (Lei Lei's I think) was very good. The rooms: Our junior suite was very roomy with lots of seating and the bed was comfortable. The decor was dated, but it seemed to be maintained ok. The carpet looked clean and on the website photos, looks fantastic, but my husband once took his shoes off and walked barefoot on the carpet and his feet were black after 10 minutes. The bathroom and dressing area was also spacious. The housekeeping staff were really slack (even though I left a $5 tip every day). There is one issue though that was a problem for us, and had it not been for the fantastic golf course, I would give this review less than 3 stars. Breakfast was included in our stay and we quickly realized that if we wanted to have a table by the window we actually needed to make a reservation, which we did every morning. The lady that ran the restaurant was completely rude, every single day. She was an older lady, and completely incapable of her job. Whomever hired her for that position really has done a disservice to the hotel. She not once EVER smiled, she would not look at anyone, she addressed people rudely. People in line waiting for a table would try and ask her something or get her attention and she ignored them all, every day. We showered her with kindness daily and said good morning to her, addressing her personally by name (from her name tag) trying to make a friendly impression hoping it would be returned. NO WAY, it never happened. This older lady has passed her expiration date and needs to retire, or else work in some capacity that does not involve other humans. We are not typically bothered by this type of behavior - everyone has a bad day from time to time, but she was unbelievable. In saying all that, there was another lovely young lady that was very helpful. She remembered us every day and would personally come out of the restaurant to get us as we waited in line as she remembered daily that we had a reservation. There seemed to be a line of people (probably 10 plus people) waiting to get a table every day. The hotel was very busy when we were there. Our son really enjoyed the pool area as it had a section with a small waterslide. The pool area was what you would expect at a resort that 'caters to the masses'. Lots of people everywhere, noisy, not enough lounge chairs. I would not call it relaxing. There are turtles in the bay, that was great. The snorkeling was not very good in the area. My advice. In all fairness, if you don't mind a 'middle of the road' hotel that caters to the masses, you are not concerned with service and loads of people and this type of hotel suits you, it is not a bad hotel. Just keep in mind that it is in no way exclusive and there is no class here. Overall, I would say we had a pretty good time, but it simply was not our taste. Indeed, the island of Oahu is not our taste. I would not go back to this hotel, nor would I go back to Oahu except to catch a flight to another island. Oahu was all new and hopping back in the 70's, which becomes obvious when you visit.

We just returned from 3 nights at the resort. Recognizing that it was New Year's weekend, I would say that the stay was okay....certainly there were not the glitches that others have reported. Our room (ocean front, king DELUXE) was clean, and spacious. However, at $450 per night, I didn't expect to see furniture that was so scratched and dented (this was not shabby chic) and carpets with stains. Bear in mind that ALL rooms have an ocean view, so don't think that you are some how luckier than others when you snag that ocean view room. We did have an ocean view once we looked beyond the roof of some large ball room/banquet room. The bathroom was clean but in serious need of some upgrading from the 70's or 80's. Like others, there was no comfy chair or loveseat to snuggle up in with a good book and at this time of the year, the weather in Hawaii is always a bit iffy. It was \"cold\", rainy and very windy on 2 out of our 3 days. I am not so bothered by the $20 resort fee because this is typical of many resorts though I do wish they would just include it in the cost of the room. When you check in, they give you a list of what your resort fee includes--it is helpful, I guess. One of my biggest complaints was trying to use the website to contact the concierge to make dinner reservations. The website's phone number for the concierge would just ring and ring and ring, so I attempted to use email to contact them. It became an annoying back and forth and it turned out that when we arrived, the reservations were not correct, but this did get resolved after beomg sent to three different people. I think that while the staff is very pleasant and tries to be helpful, there is a lack of training and follow up.Over all, it was great to escape from Waikiki, but since Turtle Bay is literally the only resort on the North Shore, it is the only game in town and has no competition. Ola's and 21 Degrees North were again just okay--we had just spent the previous four nights in Waikiki doing the fine dining scene so we had a standard that is tough to compare it to. I do find it sooo interesting that 21 Degrees North was not open on New Year's Eve--why? because they are ALWAYS closed on Mondays!

Unfortunately, it fell short of our expectations. First of all, let me say that we were there during some pretty bad storms so the power was out for almost 24 hours. This was outside of their control and we realize this. However, the experience during this time could have been exceedingly better and even after the power was restored, there were issues. The power went off sometime in the middle of the night. When I got up, I was confused about what was going on, but since I had booked a rather expensive private horseback ride, I got ready in the dark and headed downstairs to check in for that. When I got down there, I was told about the power outage and that there would be no riding as the concierge could not make it in. That was understandable. We heard that there would be a \"limited\" breakfast served in one of the restaurants. So, we went to that. The food was cold, many things were out, and there were no clean tables to sit at. Again, this is understandable given the situation BUT, the charge of $15.00 each for this was unacceptable. $5.00 would have been more appropriate for what we got. So, we ended up spending most of the day on the beach (don't need electricity for that!). I again, signed up for a private ride on the beach the next am, just in case power was restored. We were leaving the next day so it was my last chance to do this event that I had been so looking forward to. The power did finally come back on at about 9:00pm that evening so I was hopeful that I would be able to get that dream ride. So, I got up early again for the 2nd day in a row (not my style on vacation). Went ddownstairs and was AGAIN told that there would be no ride. WHY? Well, it was sprinkling a bit so not sure if no rides go out in the rain but was told that I should call later to see if they were taking the horses out. I tried to call MANY times. Never any answer. In my mind, there is no reason why they were not taking rides out and if they just wanted to wait until the shower passed (which it did about 30 minutes after) why didn't they call me to see if we could make it work out? They didn't. So, I was very dissappointed. So, we decided to go to the beach for a few hours before we needed to head back to the airport. This was about 9:30am. We went to the the hut to get towels and chairs (complimentary for guests) and found no one was there (this service is scheduled to start at 7:30). We waited for a bit and then had someone from the near by restaurant call up to see what the deal was. They were told, no towel/chair service due to \"high seas\". Well, there had been \"high seas\" since we got there with no impact on towel/chair service. And what does high seas have to do with laying on the beach? Nothing! We went up to our room and got our own towels so we could soak up a few last rays. Then, we went to our room and started packing to leave. As we looked down at the beach from our balcony, we saw that people were NOW getting chairs and towels. That was very frustrating. The power had been back on since the night before, the roads were clear and passable so there is no reason why FULL services should not have been in place that am. So, overall, the staff did a good job managing this power outage. My main complaint is about what happened afterwards. This is a beautiful resort and I was so dissappointed that I was not able to take advantage of all the amenities they advertise. On a positive note. I did talk to the front desk about my concerns and they did credit our room for the two $15.00 breakfasts and also removed the \"resort fee\" for both days.

I considered booking a room in the main hotel, but opted for one of the oceanfront cottages because I knew we just wanted to spend a few days relaxing in a surfside cocoon rather than have an active weekend of hiking, snorkeling, etc. I also was wary of the hotel rooms after reading numerous Trip Advisor reviews describing somewhat shabby conditions. We arrived late, around midnight, and the front desk clerk was friendly and helpful. I had requested a cottage with a king bed, but since only cottages with queen beds were available, she offered us a larger suite on the top floor of the hotel. I'm glad I stayed with the cottage, which was one of the nicest accommodations I have ever experienced. The cottages are like studio apartments, designed shotgun-style with a spacious bathroom near the door, a central sleeping area beneath 15-foot cathedral ceilings, a small sitting area with a desk facing the ocean and a loveseat, and then a veranda with a table, two chairs and a rocking chair. All that sits between you and the beach is a grassy walkway about 12 feet across. If you like the sights and sounds of surf mixed with the amazing tropical air of Hawaii, it's hard to imagine a nicer spot. There are 42 cottages, placed in 5-6 groups along the shorefront and apart from the hotel. We stayed in cottage 131, about as close to the ocean as you could get. There were other cottages set back farther from the beach for those who prefer more lawn between them and the ocean. The pictures and floor maps available on the hotel web site are accurate and I would suggest looking at them. [---] There's no question that the food and other services are very pricey at the hotel. In addition to the irritating $20 daily resort fee mentioned by other reviewers, all of the restaurants are expensive. We had room service breakfast one morning, which was an indulgence, but on the other days we just walked up to the hotel lobby and bought coffee from the coffee stand along with some fresh pineapple or other fruit. The coffee stand also had pastries, yogurt and protein bars. There is a sundry store in the resort where you can buy sandwich makings, soft drinks, milk, beer, wine, etc. and save some money. Even better, there's a Foodland supermarket maybe 10 minutes away where you can stock your fridge with food for breakfast and lunch and then splurge on dinner if you want. We had lunch at the poolside bar one day (a sandwich and fries will run you $15) and two meals at Ola restaurant with similarly high prices. We didn't eat at the breakfast buffet or try the special occasion restaurant on the property. The restaurant menus are on the hotel web site, so you can check out the prices and selections in advance. [---] I can't quibble with the food prices, which aren't that much higher than what you'd find at other full service resorts and which I expected after doing my research. I was, however, a little disappointed in some aspects of the service. There is a \"concierge\" assigned to the cottages, and he showed up the first day to promise he'd return each day with fresh fruit and water but we didn't really see him again after he dropped off those first two apples. When I ordered room service, I specifically requested a table setting for two, but only received one. In the bathroom, there were a few ants on the floor and a baby gecko that kept showing up near the sink (we thought he was cute, but others might not agree). These are small things, but when you pay these kind of prices for a room, there is an expectation that everything should be perfect. Due to booking during the off-season, we got a \"deal\" on the cottage booked through the hotel web site. Keep checking the Special Offers page and playing with the reservation engine to see what you can find.

Additionally, I fully disclose that I arrived at Turtle Bay with my wife on our Honeymoon after leaving the Four Seasons in Lana'i. Although I did not expect THAT level of service or attention to detail, the price did not match the value at all. Turtle Bay Resort is located on the North Shore of Oahu, about a forty-five minute drive from Honolulu without traffic. We reserved a three-night (convertible car included) stay for about $700 per night. We had rationalized the cost of our oceanfront cottage because it was the most expensive hotel booked on our three week journey. The North Shore is essentially a sleepy surfing destination and there isn't much to do in the area or at the resort. The views are truly spectacular, but that is the only thing going for Turtle Bay Resort. As stated in other reviews, the $20 daily fee is absurd. Why not just charge me $720 for the room in advance instead of angering me with a \"parking\" change when I have no other way to get to the resort besides driving Our room had been renovated within the last year or two but it was borderline filthy. The rugs and bedding were stained and our TV cabinet was broken with the door hanging off the hinge. As the icing on the cake, our screen door was ripped wide open and although maintenance \"fixed\" the issue, looking at duct tape in a $700 per night room was beyond annoying. The \"business center\" was dated and did not provide adequate internet access. I am quite sure they charge for access, but we couldn't even get the Commodore 64's to respond anyway. The included breakfast was pedestrian at best and it was during the meal (when I noticed stains and crumbs everywhere in the dining area) that I decided we would request cancellation of the rest of our stay. To Turtle Bay's credit, they did allow us to leave with no penalty or charges and were polite in accommodating us. To be fair, if we were paying $300 per night, Turtle Bay might have been manageable. That said, at this price point, the level of service and the lack of attention to detail was wholly unacceptable. Apologies for offending anyone who loves Turtle Bay, but there are any number of places to stay in Maui (or even Waikiki) that blow Turtle Bay away in terms of comfort, value and exclusivity. For $650 a night, Four Seasons Lodge at Koele or Manele Bay are beyond comparison.

If only we had actually paid that -- after fees (like the ludicrous $20 'resort fee') and taxes, we paid a little over $300 -- it would have been . . . okay. The grounds are gorgeous -- really gorgeous -- and our deluxe ocean view really was a full on ocean view; if I had a better arm, I could have chucked something in from the balcony. At first glance the room looked okay, but on closer inspection, it was just a little too worn. The mattress and bedding was more appropriate for a roadside motel -- cheap and rough -- and while there was a lightweight feather comforter, they chose to layer it between two cheap flat sheets, thus ensuring that all three flat sheets (obviously their bedding of choice) would come loose at some point during the night. In other words, the bed was a total uncomfortable mess. Not so great for a one night get away. The bathroom continued the theme of inexplicable cheapness -- toiletries that *looked* nice, but were utterly cheap and nasty, and the towels that went with them. We did have a great time walking around the grounds the next morning -- it's not like we could sleep in, in that bed -- but I did appreciate the something like *9* signs on one of the beaches, warning you not to go in the water because of rocks, strong currents, strong wave break, jellyfish . . . the list goes on. Of course I realize it's winter and the waves are stronger, but I'd really hope there's a beach somewhere on the resort that could be used by mere mortals. Then we made the mistake of eating breakfast at the hotel -- yes, they had a woman making omelets, but other than that, the food was substantially worse than even a cheap restaurant -- overcooked omelets, soggy hashbrowns, limp waffles, and fruit flies buzzing around the mandatory cheap muffin counter. Again, a nice view, but poor quality food that had been left sitting far too long. Hard to swallow at $25 per buffet plate; if you must eat there, order ala carte. I should probably say a word about the staff here: they were fabulous. The waitresses at the restaurant were kind and attentive (they even had a carafe of real tea) -- they were the ones who recommended the omelet over the scrambled eggs who had been sitting there for \"who-knows-how-long\". The valets, desk staff and pretty much everyone else we asked for help were just excellent -- they're one of the two stars I gave this review, the other being the grounds and view. The exception was the security hut, which required us to show them our room card every time we entered or left the grounds. This *might* make sense, if it wasn't for the valet pass in our windshield and the fact that the grounds are public access -- why are we being hassled *more* then if we had just come to use the beach? But this goes along with their general attitude of treating their guests like ex-cons -- you're given one towel car per person upon check in and you must trade it back and forth for clean and dirty towels. If you lose the card (or the towel) you'll be charged $25 per card upon checkout. Cups and the cutesy stuffed animal they leave in the room are similarly labeled with exorbitant fees that will be charged if these items go missing. I'm used to the little sign saying, \"if you'd like to purchase this, please take it home and we'll charge xx $\" -- I'm not used to them in such bountiful qualities. I've stayed at a variety of hotels that range from Motel 6 to uber-pricey -- Turtle Bay pretends to be the later but has all the amenities of the former. Basically: nice grounds & good staff vs. a resort run by penny pinching accountants who cut corners on everything that isn't the grounds or the lobby, and who charge countless fees designed to nickel and dime you into oblivion.

The location on the North Shore of Oahu was exactly what I was hoping for - a relaxing retreat. If you want wild night life and crowds, stay in Waikiki. Our room was on the 6th floor. A few days prior to us arriving I called and requested a room on the 6th floor because I read on TripAdvisor that the higher the floor the better the view. (The 6th floor is the top floor) When we arrived at check in they had my request and had honored it. We were in room 673 which overlooked the pool and the ocean. The room was clean and comfortable with a large lanai (balcony). The bed has all white bedding and was very comfortable. The pillows were a foam type, which I prefer. If you like down or softer pillows, you would need to ask for them. The bathroom was big. It had a separate shower and toilet/sink and then another vanity/sink area with a small refrigerator. They also had a decent hair dryer and a make-up mirror. They provided soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. The bath products are made by Gilchrist & Soames and are decent in quality. There was also a table with a coffee maker and everything you need to make coffee. There was plenty of closet and drawer space and a small safe for valuables. The hotel does charge a daily $20 resort fee on top of whatever your reservation price that you paid. This fee will get charged to your credit card that you put down for incidental charges. They do give you wireless internet access and you can use snorkel gear for an hour each day and some other benefits that are clearly explained to you at check-in. $20 a day did seem steep. The hotel staff were all very nice and very accommodating. The room was cleaned twice per day and I thought they did a great job. I especially liked the chocolate turtles they left on our pillow at night. I also liked the restaurants at the hotel. Yes, a bit pricey too, but it is Hawaii and things are more expensive and it is a resort and at this point if you are reading this, you have been warned. We had the Prime Rib Buffet and the breakfast buffet several times. We also had the Sunday brunch which was very good. We had dinner at Ola's which is right on the sand - this should not be missed! I did have one burger by the pool - the burger was good and it came with fries, but it cost $15 (plus tax and tip on top) - which I did find a bit over the top. We did go to Foodland (the market) early on in the trip and stock our refrigerator with water and snacks and beer. They have small bottles of Fiji water in the room for $3.50/bottle. We went to the market and bought a six pack of Dasani for $3.00. It just made more sense for us. The pool area and the beach were both kept clean. I did spend more time at the pool. The one day my boy friend went solo snorkeling he did see a big turtle - a definite highlight of his trip. While in the North Shore definitely spend time in Haleiwa the famous small surf town. We had lunch at Kono's in the North Shore Marketplace. The food was excellent and it is definitely a place where the locals \"hang out.\" We also had a couple of good breakfasts at Ted's Bakery in Sunset Beach - just a few minutes from the hotel. This is a wonderful bakery, but they also serve omelets and breakfast sandwiches. This is clearly a favorite of the local surfers too. We did try the famous shrimp trucks too. I had the garlic shrimp - they were peel and eat and my hands smelled like garlic for several days. They were delicious. One more thing - a car rental is a must have if you are going to stay here. Getting around the island is relatively simple.

We booked an Ocean View room and ended up technically being able to see the sea, but mostly a roof...they did offer to move us as soon as possible, but I didn't bother in the end because it's not that big of a deal - it's always warm enough (and more enjoyable) to be outside, either by the poolside area, or on the beach. They light up the waves at night, and combined with the fire thingies they have and a cocktail, it's very nice. Very nice indeed. The room itself was great, very clean, it has a decent fridge and coffee/tea making facilities, great shower etc. We paid about $1000 total for the 4 nights we were there, and I'd say we got good value. I wasn't pleased to see they'd tacked on $20 (which turned out to only be $15) a day onto our stay for certain \"amenities\" guests wanted to be included in the bill, such as parking, snorkel hire, internet access, use of gym and a few more....to me this seemed ultra cheeky, and upon checking the prices of the food, I was suddenly glad we'd saved money whilst in Waikiki by staying at a cheaper (but fine, nonetheless) hotel. It seemed we were going to need it....however... ...Coming from England and benefitting from a great exchange rate, I'd have to say the food prices wern't really that bad, or that different from anything else we've experienced on several trips to various places around the States. Expect things to be a little more expensive due to the location of the place, but it's not too bad. We didn't get to eat in the 21 degrees restaurant, but ate everywhere else. The place that serves the buffet (can't remember the name) was pretty decent, had a friendly waiter, and the food was really good (I had a full rack of ribs and a seafood chowder). For a starter, entree, and some beer, including a decent tip and tax, for me it was $50. Not bad at all, really. We ate at Ola's also, a very nice chicken dish. Great setting, down by the beach, i'd advise you to reserve. Again, not too expensive considering the setting. Another night we were looking for a quick bite late on, and the Bay Club had some chicken strips and fries for about $9, filled us right up...fairly priced. As for the area itself, it was absolutely stunning. If you want to see a decent sunset away from everyone else, head towards the WW2 bunker, gives you a nice place to sit. There are a few trails for walking around the area, which is nice. The snorkeling - an hour of which a day is \"included\" in the $20 daily charge, is excellent. You really do get to see a decent amount of underwater critters, and an hour is more than enough. The pool and 2 hottubs are both cool, and the beaches around the area are great - nothing like Waikiki, you could probably walk 10 minutes and be the only people on the beach. There is a small shop on site, which sells beer, cereal, chips, pot noodle etc....you're not supposed to consume cans purchased in here down by the pool, but who cares when you've so much beach to use? Whilst up on the North Shore, we went down to Haleiwa for the Shark Encounter, which was really cool, and we also went to the Polynesian Cultural Centre. You can get The Bus to both places pretty easily. The PCC is well worth a visit. I would say, however, that if you've been to the Beachfront in Waikiki in the evening, you don't need to stick around at the PCC for the Luau. The interactive activities available in the daytime are much more fun than the evening show, too. The Luau was fine, but it wasn't exactly sitting around a campfire talking to locals, it's basically just a buffet with performers down front dancing. Overall, the Turtle Bay is a great place to stay, and well worthwhile if you want to experience serenity after the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. In fact, I can't imagine i'd of been very impressed with Oahu had I just stayed in Waikiki and not been up to the North Shore. A notice to travellers not planning on renting a car: THE BUS DOES NOT ALLOW LARGE LUGGAGE! The hotel we stayed at in Waikiki let us store our luggage for a pittance compared to the $150 each way fare that a taxi would have cost from Waikiki. We simply packed up a smaller bag with everything we'd need, locked our luggage and had it stowed in Waikiki, and went about our business. We booked a shuttle back to the airport from the Waikiki hotel. It takes about 3 hours in total to get from Waikiki to the Turtle Bay using the bus, it's a long time but it's totally worth it for the money you save.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cThe best vacation of my life!!\u201d", "Author": "TofanelliL", "ReviewID": "UR10013161", "Content": "We just completed a 6 day stay at Turtle Bay...and I am so depressed to be home!

However, the resort is definitely not of a top caliber when it comes to service and food. The room next door to us, with whom we shared an adjoining door, suffered a malfunctioning door so that the poor guests staying there were locked out of their room. After spending all morning listening to the guests and hotel staff trying to get the door to open, they ended up accessing their room through the adjoining door in our room. They then proceeded to begin repairs to their door, calling it an \"emergency.\" The maintenance staff kept our door propped open, along with the adjoining door, so they could run power cords through them, and people kept walking in and out for about an hour, not to mention the ridiculous amount of noise all of these proceedings and repairs made. I cannot fathom why the hotel's first thought would not be to immediately move us and the guests from next door to new rooms before beginning all of this ruckus. We had to call guest services repeatedly to ask about finding us a new room. When they did find one, it took another set of phone calls (and about half an hour) to get a bellhop to come to our room to help us move all of our luggage, and more importantly, give us new keys! The next room was directly above the pool which perhaps some people would be ok with, but as we had liked to keep our balcony doors open to hear the waves crashing, it was a letdown to instead listen to alot of screaming children (I don't mind kids at all, and had alot of fun at the pool watching them play, but when I'm trying to take a nap it's a different story). They finally found us a new room, and did offer to deduct $50 from our final bill, but that's no excuse for completely mishandling the situation. I think when running such a large complex, malfunctions and accidents are bound to happen, and it's about how the management responds to such occurrences, which in this case was disappointing. On to the food, I would recommend staying away from the Palm Terrace and the Bay Club, which both served food ranging from mediocre to awful. Ola had nice food, but more importantly, a wonderful location right on the beach. 21 degrees was nice and everyone (about 6 of us) enjoyed their meal, but of course for the prices they charge ($50 for a ribeye entree!) I would expect no less. I did very much enjoy sitting on their beach, whose sand is a bit on the rocky side as beaches go.

We checked in, the lobby was OK, with a beautiful view of the water from floor to ceiling glass windows. Went up to our room, and here's where it gets bad.......... we reserved a Pikaki suite and got a room on the 5th floor, over looking the ocean. Walked into our room, and it was extremely hot and smelled musty and dusty. Walked over to the window to step out on the balcony, which could barely fit 2 small chairs on it. Went into the bathroom to freshen up, and it smelled like urine! Also, one of the towel racks was broken, but I could handle a broken towel rack, just not the urine smell! Talked to front desk, and told them we needed to change rooms and mentioned why. Even offered to down grade into a regular room if neccesary. Said they were completely booked up, but had one room left, and it was a handi-capped room, with 2 double beds instead of a king, like we had wanted. Also it was on the 2nd floor over-looking the roof and part of the pool. Definately NOT an ocean view! We took it anyways, as I didn't want to smell dust and urine for the next 3 nights. Turned the AC on high in our 2nd floor room, since the room was very hot, and went to the pool. Had drinks at the pool. Which were fine. Pricey as any other resort would be of this nature. Went to Ola's for a dinner. The food was very good! The service, not. The server never offered bread or a desert menu. The only reason we knew about the possibity of bread, is that all the other diners had some! Also, when we complimented the chef on his food, she happen to mention that the chef wasn't there and \"is never around much these days, as he just had a new baby\". Thought that was rather rude to mention. Got back up to the room, and it was only 2 degrees cooler than in the afternoon! AC did not work, and was very loud. Bed was very uncomfortable.

We had the fish tacos and hamburgers at the pool side grill which were great too. Try the Lava drink and the Pina Calada.......expensive ($9) but well worth it...they were fabulous!! We went hiking using their trails to the left of the hotel. We hiked to the beach way past the WWII bunker. We did get to see a turtle right on the beach! It was quite a distance and we really don't recommend going to that beach because the one right by the hotel is better! The WWII bunker was really great to hike to. I must warn you though that the trails are not well marked at all. They have trees occasionally marked with a small amount of spray paint on it...you could miss it. We had to turn around several times as the supposed \"trail\" would just end. We would suggest taking the guided horseback ride instead. The concierge was very helpful while we were there and the front desk too. Everyone was extremely friendly!! We did have the seaside couple massage. It was quite expensive but worth it! We went to the luau offered at the hotel which was a lot of fun. The only thing we didn't like about it is that they seat you. We were there quite early to get a good seat but they seated us so we didn't get to sit where we wanted. The food and dancers were fantastic! Definitely worth going to. Of course, the people on that side of the hotel just sat on their lanai and got a free show. So, if you are on that side just watch from your lanai for free instead of $85 each. (unless you want the food which was really good) We went snorkeling every day. Take advantage of the free 1 hour snorkel equipment (free because it is included in the $15 daily resort fee which they add to your bill). We didn't see a lot of different fish but maybe we didn't go out far enough. We did get to see a sea turtle which was awesome. It kind of scared us though because it was about only 2 feet in front of us! Very unexpected, but great!! Like I said before, the beach right at the hotel was fabulous! Get there early, as all the umbrellas are taken by 9 am, especially on the weekend! We were a little annoyed on the weekend as all the lounge chairs were gone by the time we got there at 10:00 am because a lot of the locals had taken them. I do think that you should have to check out the chairs with your hotel key like they make you do the snorkeling equipment. That way only the hotel guests get the chairs. We only had that problem once but it was quite annoying! Overall, I would definitely stay here again as opposed to Waikiki where we stayed 7 years ago. It is so nice and peaceful there.

I found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. The spa was resonably priced and their masseuse know what they are doing. I had mentioned that I was going to Pearl Harbor to the receptionist at the Spa and she was very helpful in printing out directions from the hotel to get to Pearl Harbor. Room service was delicious and cost just as much as dinning at the on site restaurants. Getting around the North Shore with a rental car was no problem if you want to find cheaper food. The shrimp shacks are about 10 minutes down the road on the east side. We ate at Romy's Shrimp Shack and you could see people fishing in the ponds behind. The food was delicious and you could buy 1 lb of freshly caught fish which they will cook for you for about $14, this comes with rice and two types of sauces. If you head west from the resort you will end up in the town of Haleiwa which has plenty of places to eat along with stores for shopping. Overall my stay at Turtle Bay was very pleasant.

There are kids of all ages everywhere, and some wake up early, so don't hope for peace even early in the day. Forget any peace near the pool before 8/9pm. Generally, if you stay away from the pool - which we did - you can easily have a relaxing time. SERVICE Service itself is true 4-star. The staff itself is 5-star.

ROOM We had the ocean front room. It is spacious. Plenty of closet space. Some wear & tear (aka lack of maintenance) put parts of the room into the 3-star category.

I was greeted at the cottage by a concierge with a glass of icy guava juice and fresh fruit and oriented to the resort's offerings. Peaceful \"yoga\" music was playing in the room when I arrived. Although there are many activities available, all I needed were the miles of connected beaches for exploration, a hammock tied to a palm tree for relaxation and some pampering. The cottage was spacious and nicely appointed. Wood floors. King bed with good pillows and comforter. Big marble bath with separate shower, huge soaking tub and nice toiletries. A split-level living area with a wet bar and refrigerator and desk/dining table. Internet included in the room charge. The room opens to a lanai which is just steps from the beach or the nearest hammock. [Note: These are not stand-alone cottages: there are three or four units per building. So you do have neighbors close by.] The resort staff were totally accommodating, from cottage concierge to room service to the front desk. I requested a cottage change on my second day and was accommodated. This saved the vacation. A noisy family with at least 10 members (at 10, I stopped counting) moved into the cottage next to me. Literally, moved in with sleeping bags for the extra guests and bags and bags of groceries (there is only a small refrigerator, no kitchen). I noticed one other huge group (mis)using a cottage this way. Happily, I was able to move away and continue quiet enjoyment of the property. The landscape around the cottages is beautiful, with exotic flowers, trees and greens. There were natural wonders everywhere. I spotted sea turtles in the water just outside my cottage. On a beach walk east of the resort, I encountered a sea lion sunning itself on a beach. Also to the east, I came across a beach with several lovely small shells. There was one secluded beach after another. The surf was tame and the water perfect. On the 4th of July, the resort put on a good fireworks show. Cottage dwellers had front row seats. After six days at the Turtle Bay cottage, I went down and spent a night at the Halekulani in Waikiki before coming home. My room at the Halekulani, while comparable in price (i.e. pricey), was small and the furnishings were old and tired. Waikiki was crowded and commercial. Who travels to Hawaii to eat at the Cheesecake Factory? I missed Turtle Bay. [In fairness, the Halekulani staff were every bit as good as the Turtle Bay staff; and the Halekulani's spa is much nicer than Turtle Bay's.] On previous Hawaii trips I have been to Maui and the Big Island.

What a blast!!! We visitied Halaiwea, Shark's Cove, Sunset Beach, Pipeline, Goat Island etc. We went into Waikii and shopped around and we went to Pearl Harbor, but got there to late to take the tour. Getting there before 12:00 is the key. One of the highlights of our trip was going to Aloha Stadium and visiting the swap meet. I highly recommend this for souveniors. We bought an album at the hotel for $20.00 and found the same album at the swap meet for $10.00. Bracelets at the hotels were $5.00 and at the swapmeet a $1.00 to $2.00. Terrific savings! The swap meet takes place on Saturdays and Sundays and is the place to go for your souveniors. It was a lot of fun!

I was a little disappointed and went to the front desk to see if it was possible to get another room. We didn't want to cause a problem but figured that we were staying for 9 nights and it would be worth a try. The front desk representative immediately changed our room with a smile and no questions asked. We had the most incredible view which overlooked the pool and the bay. We could watch the surfers from our balcony. We had the most incredible time. We went snorkling almost every day. There is a $15 resort fee for each day but we did not mind paying this because it includes 1 hour of snorkling and equipment, among other tthings. We saw beautiful salt water fish everywhere. In fact, one day we drove all the way to Haunanma Bay because we heard the snorkling was the best there, but we only stayed for 1 hour because it was better at the resort! There is a grocery store up the road, about 10 minutes away. We were able to grab things like chips and salsa to eat on our balcony. There was a small refrigerator in the room so we could store some snacks there. The restaurants are all very good in the resort but are spendy, which is expected. Our favorites were Lei Lei's and Ola on the beach. We often got drinks at Hang Ten on the beach as well and would drink them in the jacuzzi. The resort has a lot to do. There are many hiking trails and you can go on horseback rides or even a helicopter ride (we did not). We mostly had fun just hanging out and relaxing. The service was the best...everyone was so helpful and friendly. They were filming a Universal movie there during our trip, it was called Forgetting Sarah Marshall. We saw Mila Kunis from that 70's Show roaming the resort often. She always talking on her cell phone! They also filmed a tv show earlier in the week...it did not seem uncommon. I've heard of many celebs staying there. We loved the North Shore. It was perfect for us. We wanted nothing to do with Honolulu on our honeymoon since it was so crowded.

Drive into Haleiwa...it is the cutest town and they have Matumatso Shave Ice! It was delicious! The Thai restaurant was so yummy as well. There are many shrimp shacks around that are tasty.

That town is so full of high end botigues and dinning along with all the turisost that infist them, it was nice to come back to the north shore and unwind with a drink and a quick dip in the enormous pool and spa which have cascading waterfalls flowing for the cool slide..I definatley can't wait to go back!!", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cyberj10", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "Cyberj10", "ReviewID": "UR7849205", "Content": "My wife and I spent one week at the Turtle Bay Resort for our honeymoon during the last week of May and we had an amazing time. I have read a lot of the reviews here and while most of them are positive there are a few them that are negative. While I am not discounting anyone's negative review (everyone is entitled to their own opinion) I am definitely adding my vote to the positive column. First off, let me just say that if you're used to Ritz Carrolton type of service, chic, and ambiance this is probably not the place for you. While I do think the resort is beautiful and the rooms nicely appointed, this hotel is certainly not a 5 star hotel/resort. That being said our room was larger than I expected, comfortable, clean, and came with a FANTASTIC view (we were staying in a Deluxe Ocean Front Guest Room with a Large Lanai). I definitely believe that people\u2019s personal experience with this resort is largely based on their expectations. If you\u2019re just an average middle income to upper middle income couple or family you will have a wonderful time. Now that I got some of the caveats out of the way let me get to some of the specifics. My wife and I were not expecting as many families to be at the resort as there were (we thought it was more of a honeymooners location) but there were quite a few present. We however did not let this spoil our time and at no point were we bothered by someone\u2019s obnoxious children. We laid pool side just about everyday and the atmosphere was very relaxing and not the least bit noisy. Now, it was not as quiet as the pool scene you might find at an exclusive spa but if you\u2019re looking for total complete silence that is probably where you should go anyway. We found that the onsite restaurants had very good food (especially 21 Degrees North) except for the Palm Terrace. The food at this restaurant was completely sub par and couldn\u2019t hold a candle to the others yet it costs just as much. Speaking of costs, all the restaurants on this property are far from cheap but given that it is a HI resort isolated from just about everything else it is what we were expecting. If you\u2019re staying at this resort for any extended amount of time and have a rental car I strongly suggest checking out some of the local restaurants in the quaint little town of Haleiwa (pronounced Hel-lev-a I believe). This town is located about 10 miles south of Turtle Bay and I strongly recommend dinning Haleiwa Joe\u2019s. The seafood is out of this world and it is very reasonably priced ($20 - $25 average entr\u00e9e) compared to the Turtle Bay Resort. The whole town of Haleiwa is worth checking out and you can easily spend half a day checking out all the little shops and stores that are in this charming modest town. Also, a must on the to-do list is going to Ted\u2019s Bakery which is located about 5 miles south of Turtle Bay. They seriously have some of the tastiest pie\u2019s I have ever had and their food is fantastic as well. You know a restaurant is good when all the locals eat there as well. While the d\u00e9cor isn\u2019t by any means upscale this little deli-type eatery has food that is to die for and considering that is in HI, is down right dirt cheap to boot. Well, I hope my review of this wonderful resort has been beneficial to you all in helping you make your decision. During our stay we found the staff to be polite and courteous, the grounds exemplary, and the overall atmosphere breathtaking. This was truly a little slice of paradise and was the catalyst for us having an absolutely unbelievable honeymoon.

The resort is a major employer on the North Shore, which is still very rural.

Most of what they serve is from local farms and ranches. The food at 21 Degrees North is also excellent, but it's a dark room, and feels out of place to me here (plus it is very expensive). The lanais, rooms, and bathrooms are all roomy. I like the bathtub shelf for magazines -- parents would find it good for bath toys. There are always honeymoon couples, and families with kids of all ages, who all seem too find plenty to do. Beyond all the recreational activites, the site can't be beat for beauty.

I'm an attorney, my husband an engineer, so we had money to spend for something nice. Boy did we goof in booking Turtle Bay! It's a shame really because with some updates to rooms and the pools, a good exterminator, and some new chefs, this place could have the potential to be great.

There is also pretty good snorkeling in the bay as well as great hikes up deserted beaches - it's one of the only places on the island that you can have a huge stretch of white-sand beach to yourself (granted, the waves are pretty strong).

I was nervous about it because of the things I have read on here and even considered changing our reservations to stay at the Ihilani where a close friend of mine stayed, but decided to risk it. I was glad we did! We arrived to a bottle of champagne in our deluxe ocean front room and a lovely view though not as high up as I would have liked (3rd floor). The room was pretty though a tad worn but any hotel that isn't brand new and does the kind of business TBR does is going to show a little wear and tear. It was nothing horrendous though. My only complaint of the room is that the shower/tub is standard and small. The bathroom itself is large. The first night we ate at Lei Lei's...I got a fabulous shrimp cocktail and ceasar salad, my husband got a filet mignon he said was the best steak he ever had (the fact that he was starving didn't hurt I'm sure haha). The following day we walked to the Turtle Bay beach (good snorkeling), and went to Kawela Bay which is beautiful without a doubt but I found the water to be annoying because it is shallow unless you go VERY far out. Like knee deep shallow, waist at best. The thing I noticed is that nobody has really mentioned how close some amazing things are to TBR. Waimea Bay (you MUST go there!), Sharks Cove, and Sunset Beach are all a short drive (Waimea Bay Beach Park is about 8miles away and that's the furthest one). Also it always sounds like Foodland and other stores are so far away that it would be a chore to leave TBR to go back so you have to stop on the way in...not so, it's right down the road. Time here like anywhere depends on traffic which was rarely heavy on the north shore. We did the horseback riding morning ride at TBR and enjoyed it so much we went on the longer afternoon ride the next day. It was very enjoyable, the horses have their own personalities, so amusing. We also did a snorkel cruise with North Shore Catamaran that was arranged for us by the concierge. We turned out to be the only people signed up that day so we got a private trip that was a blast. Wednesday we drove to Ko Olina and had dinner at Roy's. Dinner was great and worth the trip, and while we were there I saw the Ihilani and the not so pretty area surrounding it and confirmed I was glad we chose TBR. Our package included breakfast buffet at Palm Terrace each day and I have to say if you can't find something you like on that buffet you must be very picky or just not like breakfast! I DO NOT however recommend the dinner buffet...gross and left me spending the night and following day very ill to my stomach. Breakfast is safe though and yummy. Dinner at 21 Degrees North was expensive but that is to be expected and still came out cheaper than I expected. I got the lobster, husband got the ahi tuna...it was fabulous. Also try the strawberry smoothies at the Hang Ten bar by the pool....sooo good. We went to Pearl Harbor and made the mistake of not getting there early, parking was a hassle and we had to wait almost 2hrs to go out to the Arizona Memorial. It's worth a trip to see it but get there early! Also if you stay at TBR definitely rent a car. We rented from Alamo and lucky for us we didn't have any problems like a previous poster mentioned. All the staff we encountered were polite and helpful, the pools were great. I would definitely stay there again especially to avoid the crowds of Honolulu/Waikiki.

I feel obligated to write one because I was absolutly obsessed with reading all of your reviews before embarking on this journey and boy am I sooooo glad that I decided to make Turtle Bay Resort for my romantic destination for my boyfriend and I. Renting a convertible (through Advantage rental cars) is an absolute MUST and so is bringing along 'Oahu Revealed' travel companion book. (This was like our Bible the entire trip). I also recommend not bringing very much clothes, you'll only use flip flops, swimsuit, shorts and a t-shirt the entire time you are there. SO pack light, and don't bring too many shoes, long pants or jackets/sweaters-you'll be lugging alot of extra unnecessary weight. Our arrival at Turtle Bay resort was absolutly breathtaking, not to mention the drive there on Kamehameha Hwy you pass by some of the most beautiful beaches including Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach and Turtle Beach. Keep the convertible top down and soak in the cool ocean breeze and sunshine. Valet staff were very courteous with helping with luggage and everyone greets you with a warm smile and 'aloha'. Checking in went very smoothly and we were given a great room on the 6th floor facing Sunset Beach, swimming pool and the cottages. I had heard that if you were a 'I Prefer' member, you could get an automatic upgrade to the suite, if available. Unfortunately, the hotel was booked and this was not availabe to us because of all the rooms that are booked for the film crew and actors that are staying there for the filming of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' but they treated us with a cold bottle of champagne and 2 flutes a few minutes after we got into the room. What a wonderful delightful treat! I also loved and fought over the coconut macaroons they put on your bed every night at turn down service. We had a large lanai with the most breathtaking view of all the swimming pools, sunset beach and the beach cottages. Room #622!!! I have heard that ALL the rooms have GREAT views unless you are on the 2nd or 3rd floor where your primary view is of the roof and the beach is obstructed by tall palm trees. Ask for an upgrade to the Pikake suite or at least a room on the 6th floor (best view on top floor). Bathroom was large with double sinks and large double wide closets. Room decor was very modern, sleek, tropical and relaxing. The ONLY qualm I have was of the bedding, I read about this in other reviews and I can confirm that I do treasure my nice plushy mattress back home with soft pillows which guarantees a good night sleep. The mattresses in the room were thin and springy and need to be replaced VERY badly. I also had to request 'softer foam pillows' because the 4 very large firm pillows were very uncomfortable and will give you neck cramps. Guest services are very gracious with providing these for you right away. Spa services were very expensive but if you have the money, very good Pedicure services and facials. In the facial I think they try too hard to sell you the products they are using and take away from the quiet serenity of your facial. They also have couples massages in a beach bungalow, very romantic. Book them ahead of time!!!! Perhaps before you leave for Hawaii. We utilized all the tips in the Oahu Revealed book regarding North Shore excursions. We ate at Ola's for both lunch and a dinner, both very good but as expected, expensive. They have a variety of seafood, steak and pasta selections with excellent service. Ola's is literally on the sand on the Kawela beach side. We also ate the breakfast buffet at Palm Terrace ($20/person) which has a good omelet made to order bar, smoked salmon and selection of hot foods and pastries. In my opinion the Palm Terrace Dinner buffet ($30-40) is NOT worth it, especially if you go later in the night, King Crab was rubbery and cold and prime rib was kinda fatty. Also the 'Hawaiian Fish' was tasteless as well as the Salmon filet. Best meal at the resort has to be at Lei Lei's, valet service will shuttle you the short distance in a golf cart to the restaurant. They had the most amazing seafood pasta, salads and very good solid service as well. The atmosphere was romantic, dim and candlelit. I would like to have eaten there again but didn't get a chance. Our last night we made reservations for 21 degrees north. Very formal dress and requested a window seat, but doesn't really matter at night because the view is black with night. $200 for 2 people including wine. They had a very good chef's special including a 5 course meal with wine pairings with each course. Very good service and courses come as soon as you're done with the previous one. The berry creme tart was very cheesecake tart-ish and decadent. The prime rib and crab encrusted mahi mahi was savory and satisfying. Overall it is alot of food but well worth the $76 for the 5 courses. We spent most of our days on the North Shore except the day we went to Pearl Harbor and the Aloha Bowl Swap Meet. You don't have any other reason to go back down to the south area because there is SO much to do in the North Shore. The North Shore is very secluded, quiet, serene and everything you would want out of a relaxing and romantic vacation. Don't waste your time with the Polynesian Cultural Center luau. Complete waste of money for bad cold tasteless buffet style food and a less than mediocre luau show. They pack over 600 people into a small area, you feel like a prisoner in a prison cafeteria. They do have a good Twilight Show afterwards with fire dancing and well coreographed dancing. Other MUST Do's include: Eat at the Kahuku shrimp trucks, Romy's has the best garlic prawns (except they're hot you might burn your fingers when peeling them). Eat at Haleiwa Joes- they have the best Lava Flows, can't taste the alcohol at all!, Matsumoto's Shave Ice, VERY good breakfast at Haleiwa Cafe. Order the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich at the Hang Ten Bar poolside while you're laying out and relaxing- VERY GOOD! I also saw actress Mila Kunis having a drink at Hang Ten. Shop for snacks at Foodland about 20 minutes away, and stock your refrigerator! Rent your snorkel gear from the Surf Shop across from Shark's Cove- $25 for the week for snorkel, fins and goggles. Snorkel at Shark's Cove and the cliff jumping side of Waimea Bay, you'll see alot of turtles and tropical fish! Shark's cove can be kinda reefy and sharp, be careful entering and exiting. Go Jet Skiing at the Haleiwa boat harbor. They let you jet ski around in the open ocean as oppossed to on a set track. SO MUCH FUN! Rent one of the RED ones that have more horse power. $65 for half hour, believe that's enought, it's more exhausting than you think! Also take advantage of the Catamaran snorkeling tours and Sunset Dinner Cruises out of Haleiwa boat harbor. Don is the owner of the company and has alot of good stories and is very enthusiastic about driving his boat and showing you a good time. Make sure he brings along a bucket of fish chum to hand feed the Galapagos sharks. They also have North Shore Shark Adventures, go in a shark cage and feed the sharks from your bare hands! Jump off a 40 foot cliff, snorkel and swim around the cliffs at Waimea Bay and basque in the sun on this beautiful beach! It is my absolute FAVORITE beach in all of Hawaii. If you have time go to the Waimea Bay Audubon Center and hike to the waterfalls, you can swim underneat them! Took the drive up Round Top and Tatulus with the most stunning and amazing views of the South Shore including all of Waikiki and Diamond Head. Bring a laptop and take advantage of the free wi-fi in your room, you'll use it to look up resources, make reservations for adventures and at restaurants. But the concierge would suffice as well. Other things I wish we would have time for in the very short 7 day trip was: surf lessons, horseback riding on the beach, kiteboarding, explore other sides of the island such as Hanauma Bay, Makapu Point, Sandy's Beach, Secret Beach, Chinaman's Hat, kayaking in Kaneohe Bay, jump off La'ie point, eat at Breaker's for good ol American food or at Cholo's for good Mexican food, and explore the secret caves at Shark's cove, scuba diving and wished we went to Germaine's for the luau instead of the PCC. that's all for now, have fun and use LOTS of sunscreen even when you think you're so naturally dark you won't burn, YOU WILL!", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Time at the Turtle Bay\u201d", "Author": "jycnyc7", "ReviewID": "UR7573190", "Content": "My husband, three year old son and I stayed at this resort earlier this year. We stayed in a beach cottage for two nights, but wish we could have stayed longer! The accommodations were amazing. The cottage was very roomy with high ceilings and had a lovely four poster king-size bed. There was a sweet sea urchin stuffed animal sitting on the bed when we first arrived, which was a gift for my son. That was a nice touch. The bathroom was huge, with a soaking tub and separate glass shower. A friend said that the tub was the biggest she's ever seen. But the best part about the cottage was the location. It was situated on a lawn right in front of a beach. We had the most amazing view of the beach and ocean from our room, and we also had a lanai where we could sit and soak in the view and listen to the sound of the waves. And the sun sets right in front, so we saw the most incredible sunset from the comfort of our cottage. The only drawbacks of the cottage were (1) not enough seating -- it only had chairs that you couldn't really lounge around on. With that much space in the cottage, they could have included a sofa; and (2) people were able to traipse back and forth in front of our lanai, so we didn't have much privacy and had to keep the curtains drawn in the cottage if we didn't want people looking in, and then we couldn't enjoy the view if the curtains were drawn. The cottage also included special concierge service which I didn't quite understand. The concierge greeted us when we first arrived with drinks and free t-shirts, and got us ice once. Other than that, we never saw him. The rest of the resort was mixed. The grounds were nice -- especially the pool area, the main beach (on the other side of the resort) and the views of the ocean from the path that ran along the resort. The public areas and restaurants in the main hotel looked quite ordinary -- it used to be a Hilton and they really haven't done much to upgrade the decor. I took a quick look at a junior suite in the main building. The room itself was nicely furnished and had an incredible view, but the bathroom was nothing special. We did not deal much with the resort staff, other than check in, requesting towels, and ordering food to-go at Ola's, the restaurant by the main beach (the food there was very good, by the way). The staff we did deal with were all very friendly. All in all, we had a wonderful time at the Turtle Bay. My son loved it the best out of all the hotels we stayed in Hawaii.

We discovered the Turtle Bay website when first researching where to stay, but thought we wouldn't be able to afford it, as we were originally planning a trip during the summer. But changing the dates to April made all the difference! We were there from April 22 - 27, and it was fabulous. The staff was fantastic, the food was great....the Ahi fish plate at Lei Lei's is WONDERFUL....and the grounds are absolutely incredible. There is a view everywhere you look. Our only complaint was the lack of transportation available -- we tried to coordinate an early morning deep sea fishing trip from the docks in Haleiwa, and didn't want to rent a car for the day just to have it sit in the dock....so we tried to hire a taxi, but it was nearly impossible to find a ride. The guys at the concierge desk weren't much help - - they had one number to call, and just kept telling us, \"He's not answering.\" We went on a tour to Pearl Harbor, and our tour guide, who lived in Kahuku, volunteered to be our \"taxi\" to the dock the next morning, which was so sweet (anybody needing transportation should call Walford \"Tui\" Lolofie at Island Transporter - - he's wonderful), but due to the strong trade winds, the fishing charter was cancelled. It was pretty windy the whole time we were there, but enjoyably so (it made the waves even bigger!) We went to the Polynesian Cultural Center for the luau and evening show.....both very good, although next time, we'll stay at Turtle Bay for their Friday night luau (we left on Friday, so weren't able to do it this time.) The walking trails are great - - we strolled along most of them, and there are private beaches all over the place, if you want to get away from everything, although the main beach at the hotel was never crowded. We had read in the reviews about the pool being too cold, but I didn't find that at all - - it was refreshing, and I have to admit I went down the slide in the kids pool quite a few times....what better time to act like a kid than on vacation! The mai tai's at the Hang Ten bar will knock your socks off....one is a must....and two is too many! We did order a room service pizza, based on other reviews written on this site, but didn't find it to be anything spectacular, although it arrived in less than 15 minutes! We had packed a bunch of snacks, etc., in our luggage, since we had heard how expensive everything was, but the little store by the pool had everything you could possibly want, and we didn't think the prices were outrageous - - higher than the mainland, yes, but that's to be expected. Basically, the things that \"cost\" are alcohol ($9 for a mai tai at the Hang Ten....$8 for a glass of wine at the Bay Club), and transportation (it cost $100 each way, including the tip, to get back and forth from the airport.) But, hey, it's heaven on earth.....and was worth every penny. We're already saving to go back, and when we do, we're going straight back to Turtle Bay!

We have been to Oahu many times before and I really like this resort. You get the feel of true Hawaii there. I didn't feel like I was in Oahu here. The resort is very big with it's own beach and golf course. I'm not a golfer but from what I seen the course is very beautiful. On this side of the island, the winds can pick up a lot. This is why on this side of the island, they have the famous north shore waves (the pipeline). Everyone there is friendly, of course they are, it's Hawai'i. We got the Local Discount (Kamaina Discount). The rooms are very room with a view of the ocean. The Lanai was big and my lil daughter love going out there. We also got them to put a crib in the room but the cribs are very small for a 22 month old. No problem, the bed was big that we all slept on the bed. The pool is big enough for those who don't want to swim at the beach. Food is pretty pricey but that is expected. There are small little places to eat outside the resort like the Island Shack. And it is what it is, a Shack. If you want some fancy dinning then stay at the resort. Plenty of restaurants there. But as others say, go to Foodland outside the resort and stock up on some food you can eat cold and drinks. You can even buy some pre-mixed Mai Tai mix and some rum that can last you a while. And drink some local beer.....your in Hawaii. Budweiser stays at home (Budweiser is nasty anyways). Back to the room, there is wireless internet there for those who have that power with their laptop. We stayed on the second floor where we thought there was a big wedding going on. They were actually filming a NBC Universal production movie called Forgetting Sarah Marshall staring Mila Kunis (That 70's show) and Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars). We found this out because they accidently slip a \"Shooting Call\" note under our door thinking we were one of those part of the crew. I saw Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell at the fitness center working out with their trainer. Got to talk to Mila Kunis real quick but didn't really wanna bother her. By the way, the fitness center is small but is it works. Some times it can can get pretty packed in there. So get there real early then you can enjoy the rest of the day. The beach by the resort was very nice. We actually saw a turtle about 10 feet off of shore. We ordered drinks at Ola and brougt them down to the beach. The pool has a fun slide and pictures of turtles at the bottom of the kids pools that my daughter loves. The shop next to the pool is very expensive for souvineirs.

Rather than visit another island as our time was only a week, we chose to spend a few days at the Turtle Bay Resort followed by the Outrigger Waikiki. Its very hard to add anything to previous reviews. The room was huge and beautiful, the view incredible; crashing waves, surfers, whales, rainbows. We found TBR to be perfect for our family with 2 teenagers. The huge dressing room with a sink was perfect for 4 people attempting to get out the door; not that we were in any rush to go anywhere. The view makes it pretty easy to wait on the stragglers; or to just sit on the balcony read a listen to the ocean. No one ever turned on the TV. The dressing room has a door, you can close it, the coffee maker is in there, and not disturb the rest of the family, big enough to bring chairs in if you wanted to read later. I loved being able to see the ocean from the bed! We had the buffet breakfast each morning in the main dining room. Yes, food is expensive, and it was excellent, we found it more reasonable to chose the buffet over the menu and we didn't need to eat again until late afternoon. It wasn't on the menu; but when our waitress realized a couple of us weren't wanting the hot things on the buffet, it was about $15 for the continental part only; which in itself was a huge amount of food. The full buffet was $22 (the beautiful Pink Palace on Waikiki is more in the $29 range). Sitting outside, enjoying the view, over a leisurely breakfast was heaven. We ate at Ola's on the beach and it was good too. A car is simply the cheapest way of getting to TBR; we only left once for the Polynesian Cultural Center; we choose to just do the later day admission and show. I would have preferred better seating and those options are there, they were sold out; book in advance. We stopped at the G shrimp truck, and yes they were good; but I've had yummy ones on the mainland too, and I'm not crazy about having to remove all those yucky parts first. My daughter loved the garlic hot dog there! The Resort Fee - self parking included - this is a bargain. Waikiki wanted $25 night!! I also liked the beach towel service. Each person receives a plastic card that you exchange for a towel. You return the towel, they give you a card back, however many time you want in a day. Very easy.

Probably won't stay here again, but will definately make the trip to North Shore on my next visit. Staff was very nice and all, it's just very expensive and to me you don't get much for it.

And this is really the only resort on the north shore. The customer service is fantastic. The resort is very clean. The views from every angle are fantastic. Access to the beach is super easy. There are lots of shops in the hotel if you forgot anything. We had a wonderful time at TBR recharging our batteries. We hung out there and also cruised all over the north shore exploring. You'll definitely need a rental car to do that. We are really happy with our experience. Having said that, I'm not sure I could have stayed there more than 5 days. It's just a tad more sedate and as lots of people have mentioned, the rooms are expensive and the food is expensive. While everything was wonderful, I\u2019m not sure we'll stay there again. We will definitely go back to the North Shore but we'll rent a house next time. ROOM Amenities: Waffle bathrobes, slippers, coffee (dried creamer kind of a downer), fridge, nice shampoo/conditioner/body wash/q-tips/cotton balls/sewing kit/bath cap, HUGE double closet, extra sink in dressing area, nice books and magazines (for the ultra wealthy who can afford what's in them or those of us who like to day dream), hairdryer THE UPSIDE Stunning view. Our room was less than 25 feet from the shore. Aside from the view, my favorite was the sharper image radio/clock do-dad that was set on a pre-programmed setting of Asian ambient music when we arrived. It also had a connection to plug into your iPod so you could listen to your own music. The room was updated and SUPER roomy. The entire wall facing the beach was a series of sliding windows with giant sliding wooden shutters which allowed controlling your environment. Nice. Nice comfy furniture Large patio Super nice housekeeping staff Great turndown service. The first few nights the put chocolate covered macadamia nut out for us, the last night they put homemade macaroons wrapped in fresh banana leaves. VERY NICE touch. ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT While the bedding looks sumptuous, for the caliber of resort that they portray themselves as being, the bed was kinda disappointing. We weren't uncomfortable but I have stayed more than my share of nights at Hilton and Marriotts who have upgraded their beds/bedding and are ultra comfy. The TBR bed was kinda springy, the pillows were disappointing. The down comforter was a nice weight but the duvet had sort of a \"been washed way too many times\" feel too it, and not in a good way. No full length mirror Have to call the front desk so they can unlock your account to order movies. The dried creamer DINING We ordered room service our when we checked in. I had the best burger of my life. It was also the most expensive at $18.00. The b/f ordered pizza which was very good also. Generally I'd say the food was good but like others noted, very expensive. We ate 4 meals at the resort. I think each meal ran us $100.00 with 1 drink each. Sunday brunch was good and they had a local singer there singing tunes. He was very good. Nice background music. Something to consider is that they are focused on wanting you to have reservations. We bought snacks and beer at a market that's nearby. That worked well. We ate at Giovanni's shrimp truck which is out of this world. My mission next week is to try making the garlic/butter shrimp myself. Bring your own beer (they don't sell it), order the garlic/butter shrimp and a side of hot sauce. You won't be sorry. (We also tried Macky's for a comparison and we were sorry. Giovanni's all the way). POOL The pool area (there are 2 plus a few hot tubs) are really nice and overlooking the ocean where the surfers take their lessons. It's really relaxing. It's not crowded and much smaller than hotels in Waikiki. BEACH The beaches near the hotel are of wonderful white sand. I've been to Maui before and was pleasantly surprised with how many wonderful beaches there are (seemingly EVERYWHERE) along the north shore. You won't be disappointed. The cove on the resort (near Ola's restaurant) has a sundries stand where the attendant will drag out reclining chairs to the beach for your sunbathing pleasure. If you get out early, there are also a several preset umbrellas to hide under. We had read about the $15 per day resort fee. I\u2019m not really sure why they carve this out separately from your hotel room rate. It basically gets you free wifi and towel service for the pool/beach. It may be that there are condo owners on the property and they want to charge them that rate also. Dunno.

This hotel I would recommend to would be consumers with the following points: -Read the other recent reviews of this hotel on Tripadvisor \u2013 they really helped -Don\u2019t book direct, go through an internet based service -You need a car if you want variety of cuisine / scenery \u2013 there are nearby towns (Haleiwa is by far the best for food, shopping etc) -The food at the hotel is ridiculously overpriced (around $45 for 2 burgers and drinks, over $30 for a steak etc). However the food is very good. Our advice: go to the nearby (5 or so miles West) store Foodland, ask for a free Foodland discount card and stock up your hotel fridge with nice stuff (champagne, deli, breakfast etc) \u2013 save lots of $. -Other prices are what you would expect \u2013 double the price of goods and services compared to prices in Haleiwa -The hotel will charge you an extra $15 per day which you have to pay (this covers coffee in house, parking space, access to the gym, daily hour snorkel rental etc and is based on their customer feedback (according to them). This is very annoying when you check in \u2013 we booked through Orbitz and this extra charge wasn\u2019t made clear to us before arrival \u2013 not a good feeling when you check in \u2013 however the free wireless internet (which the inexplicably do not market for some reason) helps to make up for this charge Plus points: -The room and views are great \u2013 I stressed that I needed a top (6th) floor room as the views would be great \u2013 we were not disappointed -The room is clean (my wife is pregnant so very important) and the staff are reasonably helpful (although some of the wait-staff are spaced-out) -Good pool / decent beaches -The location is superb \u2013 surf / beach lovers are close to Haleiwa, the Pipeline and Sunset beach. Waikiki is only an hour away for those that want the city scene for a while -Access to yoga classes several times per week (around $7 per class) The ideal people staying here would be late 20s+ couples who want a good base to explore the north shore and chill out for a few days. If you don\u2019t have a car, we feel this resort would get a little repetitive and very expensive after a few days of paying their prices. Other notes for beginner surfers: -Beware of the \u2018surf club\u2019 \u2013 this isn\u2019t affiliated to the hotel and does capitalize on beginner surfers \u2013 hourly rental for boards for beginners is $15 \u2013compared to $7 elsewhere and $10 for more advanced boards. I asked the unhelpful sultry chick behind the desk of the store why this was and she shrugged and said \u2018more business \u2013 experienced surfers have their own boards\u2019 \u2013 not a great attitude\u2026. Needless to say they didn\u2019t get my business -Beware of the surf lessons given by the Surf and Sea in Haleiwa \u2013 the $75/2 hour lesson I received was given by a guy who made us feel that he was doing us a favor by fraternizing with uncool novice surfers for the afternoon \u2013 maybe we just got unlucky with the instructor as otherwise that store was really cool and the staff were nice. My advice - ask to talk with the guy/gal who will give the lesson before paying for it. Parting note: We would recommend this to others with the above points in mind.

I knew my dad wanted to be on the North Shore and as soon as I saw Turtle Bay I knew I found our resort. The Resort is beautiful and as soon as you pull up to the indoor / outdoor lobby you are impressed. It is very secluded and quiet. The drive to the airport is great! The view from our room was awesome. Out our window we faced northeast at the ocean and could see all the way down the beach. The lush gardens and beautiful beach made this trip extra special. Our room was fantastic and very clean. My mother and I are neat freaks and it is very hard to get her to go on vacations but she had no complaints about the room or the hotel (5 stars). It was very easy to get anywhere in the hotel and all windows had supreme views. We were all very impressed. Plus the shops in the hotel had everything you need or just want. We ordered room service a couple of times and they were very friendly. Every one at Turtle Bay was so nice. One lady that worked at the hotel sat and talked with my mother about her garden and brought beautiful flowers to show every one at the resort. She was so proud of it. Now to the food\u2026. WOW!!! We had coupons for the breakfast buffet every morning and it was soooo good. Only draw back is that we were to full most days to enjoy any other food! It was different every morning and to good to be true every morning. We had dinner at the same restaurant one night and again it was great. I was a little disappointed on our anniversary night. I wanted to eat at the other restaurant they have there but it was closed. I think it was Tuesday. We also missed the Friday Luau because we had tickets for the Polynesian Cultural Center.

On our honeymoon 8 years ago, in 2003 and 2005. Each time we loved it.! We have watched TBR go from a 2-3 star to a 4-5 star property. Unfortunately, the price increased as well but it is well worth it. To experience \"real\" hawaii Turtle Bay is the perfect place. In fact as soon as my husband returns from Iraq in April we are heading out there again! A car is a must to visit TBR as it's approx 1 hour drive through pinapple fields and small coffee fields from Honolulu airport. The drive is peaceful and beautiful. TBR is on the famed North Shore by the Bansi Pipeline and Sunset beach. While there in Nov 2005 we were able to watch part of the Royal Crown surfing championships. The waves were so large that they occaionally spilled on to the roads. It's spetacular! They actually had to postpone the surfing for a day or two because the waves were so high. So if swimming is high on your list know that the North shore sports 30 to 50 ft waves during the winter months. There are plenty of other swimming sites closer to Honolulu. There is a nice cove for snorkling with outdoor showers to rinse off at the hotel itself that is protected enough to swim in during the winter. However, there are nicer snorkling beaches on Oahu. For example Hanamuma bay (spelling ?) is perfect year round. You won't find a better view of the ocean from any other hotel. TBR sits on a point in Turtle Bay, hence the name and boast miles of shoreline to meander through. Bring water shoes as sometimes the shore is rocky with coral and can cut barefeet. Yes, there are large sea turtle there and also laws to protect them so stay at least 5 -7 feet away from them and never try to touch them. There are several private coves around the resort so if your lucky you might find your self swimming with them. Don't be alarmed they mostly ignore humans. True, Turtle Bay is not in the same class as say The Orchid on Kona however it far surpasses a stateside Marriott or Hilton and never feels stuffy. The lobby was redone with an entire wall of windows facing directly out onto the ocean. On our last visit we stayed in one of the remoleded rooms and were extremely pleased with the decor. Wood and modern painting schemes, in white and spa green, made it feel cosmopolitian while new mattresses with down comforters made it comfortable. The bathrooms were redone in marble and are spacious and functional and the small refridgerator came in very handy. I liked the amenties so well I took some of them home. For those on a budget I recommend buying your breakfast items at the local grocery store and enjoy them on your lanai (balconey) each morning. Haliewa, a small surfing town, has some inexpenive and very good eating establishments and is well worth the visit. For incidentials avoid the resort stores and try Wal Mart or Ross instead. I typically will buy an \"Entertainment Book\" for Hawaii online prior to our visit and have saved hundreds of dollars on meals and attractions. When we leave I will usally leave the book for the maid or someone who has helped us during our stay. The North Shore is a wonderful place to experience the true Hawaii it is not rich nor fancy but real and beautiful. I have always found the locals to be friendly and helpful and as long a you respect them and their home, they will go out of their way to help you.

We loved everything about the resort, and I booked a return trip for 7/2006 as a graduation gift to my daughter. Turtle Bay is located on the North Shore of Oahu, which is about an hour north of the Waikiki/Honolulu area. Both visits were fabulous. I will point out some differences to those who might not be sure when in the year is best to visit this beautiful island. Our November trip to the North Shore was more crowded, both at the hotel and the North Shore area in general. This is due to the surfing contests in town. However, crowded is nothing like the crowds we experience here at the jersey shore in the summer, but croweded compared to my second visit in July. November seemed warmer to me, and less windy. There was rain almost daily in the fall, however a short lasting mist early in the day, nothing that stops you from going about your daily activities. The landscaping was lush and green, and we were able to visit Pearl Harbor in less than 1/2 day. July 2006: It was windy at the North Shore! You had to anchor your light items in place or they would blow away. In New Jersey we would call this \"gale winds\", in Hawaii they are known as \"trade winds\".. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was much much windier in July than in November and this seems to be the norm from what I was told by the locals. Because of this, it seemed a little cooler, however I did not notice the winds in Waikiki, and the winds did not stop us from swimming, it just seemed a little cooler and less humid than it was in November. The North Shore was nearly deserted too. There are no waves here during the summer months, so the surfers are not around and the traffic is practically non existant in this area. The North Shore is quiet compared to Waikiki any time of year, but in this little town with a two lane road, traffic in the winter months does back up. The North Shore area, including Turtle Bay Resort, seems to close down for the evening early. No drinks at the pool late at night because the poolside bar closes at 9 pm. Things get very quiet at night, so if you are looking for nightlife, you are better off in Waikiki. Waikiki incidentally, is about an hour's drive south of Turtle Bay Resort. We made the trip a few times in a rental car and it's not a bad ride. If I have the chance to visit this island again, I might stay a few days in Waikiki, then head over to the North Shore. That would probably be the way to experience the best of both worlds when visiting this wonderful island. About the resort itself: the rooms are large, clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. The down comforters on the beds are very nice. The beds are comfortable. The lanais are spacious and just about every room offers an ocean view, although the higher you are (floors 5-6), the better your view. The food is good, the service outstanding. The prices are what you would expect in a resort like this ie: $12 cheeseburgers, $8 pina coladas. My daughter had just come back from an all inclusive vacation in Punta Cana and said the food in Hawaii was so much better....everything about Hawaii and this resort in particular was classy compared to Punta Cana she said. There is a grocery store 5 minutes from the resort, where I bought snacks and drinks for the kids, there is also a little store by the pool that offers the same, and that is an option as well. If you are on a strict budget, the prices of the food and drinks might be intimidating, but if you look at it as \"I'm on vacation\"...then you realize you're in Hawaii and this is what you pay. We ate off premisis alot and those prices are similar to what you would find on the mainland US. Try the shrimp trucks and the surf shack in town for an affordable taste of local cuisine! Horseback riding is a must do excursion, the trail runs oceanside for much of it and the staff is wonderful. The slide at the kids pool was a big hit, and the poolside wait staff was excellent and very attentive. The hotel offers a Luau which is nice, there is also a fabulous luau at the Polynesian Cultural Center about ten minutes up the road. Both offer a unique experience, the hotel's luau is smaller and more intimate, the Polynesian Cultural Center's luau is a lavish display and it's an experience that takes all day between visiting the center, the luau and the show. I can't say I prefer one over the other, they are both superb and it's a matter of personal taste as far as what type of luau experience you wish to have. The Polynesian Cultural Center is worth a visit regardless of whether you purchase luau tickets, it was definately one of my favorite parts of this trip.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Niguel", "Title": "\u201cWonerful time\u201d", "Author": "famoffivelgnniguel", "ReviewID": "UR6582606", "Content": "My Husband and thre kids (14, 11 and 6) stayed at TBR for 5 nights.

Came from three days at the Halekulani. In short? There are ways to enjoy this place and ways not to. If you have the right expectations and work at getting the right room for your expectations you will be in good shape and really enjoy yourself. Otherwise? No. The setting is beautful - that is the shoreline is beautiful. The workers are lovely and very accomodating and friendly. The food at Ola's and the Palm Court breakfast buffet (only things we tried,) is average for luxury accomodations, meaning pretty darn good. However, the hotel is worse than people are letting on. First, the lobby has the feeling of a convention center. And someone had the terrible idea to put yellow light in the ceiling light boxes. And the breakfast place, the Palm Court, has no doors and is open at the end of the lobby which means that that awful industrial food smell is prevalent, not always, but often enough. Eek. Second, the hotel from the outside is also poorly designed. While the bay and cove are nice, to get to them when you walk outside the hotel you go down a LOOOONG concrete stairwell. And then you see the hotel trucks and storage area. And occasionally smell the garbage. And when you walk from the cove to the bay, you have to walk all around what is essentially a large concrete basement, with conference rooms and wedding spaces above that are kind of like walking near small city buildings. Needless to say, there are no photos of this on the website. But that wedding point they show? Fronted by a lot of 70's concrete. So even the lovely setting around the hotel itself is not perfect. Eek. Third, the rooms are spartan. And not spartan like the Post Ranch Inn or Hotel Healdsburg. Spartan like a slightly more tasteful and rural Marriott. Also, the king rooms just don't have enough furniture:). No arm chair, slightly scarred desk, etc. Bathroom with nice pale green marble tiles but oldish painted wood cabinets with no detailing and oldish tile and dirty grout in the bathtub. And no separate shower, yup, you are in there with the plastic shower curtain and it is not pristine. And someone, probably the same person who put the yellow lights in the lobby, has painted the walls a green that's supposed to be Restoration Hardware celadon but is actually more hospital. Eeek again. Now, if you play your cards right, as other people have said, you can get a room high up. Much more important than Deluxe, which gives you a bigger lanai but a view of the roof. Yes, we were in one of those first too:). So best in-hotel strategy is to spend as little as possible for as high a room possible that faces either the swimming cove or the surfing bay. Ask when you call. And, for those who can spend money, the Beach Cottages look great. I didn't reserve one because I was afraid they were too isolated for my teens. No. They are just across a little bridge. I didn't see the inside, but they sound pretty nice. And the big plus is that they have a lawn in front, look right at the surfing bay, and have hammocks and lawn chairs. Now THAT's Hawaii...And you rarely have to pass the concrete basement. and conference room areas, or the garbage, etc. Horseback riding is great, snorkeling is OK, there are secluded beaches on the property you can have all to yourself, the food is pretty darn good, and the service is very very nice. Really they ought to smash the conference rooms, and redo the lobby, and refurnish the rooms. But, as the only game in town, and all of us willing to pay $500 for rooms in high season, why would they. So either spend the big bucks for a Beach Cottage and eat at Ola's and go into Halaeiwa and go horseback riding, and take picnics to the secluded beachs,etc and enjoy the North Shore, or, wangle the lowest cost possible for a high floor room of whatever size, don't eat the hot buffet, and you can stay in a world class spot for a reasonable price. In case you need to know where I have traveled to put my review in context, Four Seasons Haulalai, Halekulani, Club Meds (yes why not), Hotel Healdsburg, Ritz Carlton NY, Jamaica Inn Ocho Rios, Royal Hawaiian, Post Ranch Inn, St. Regis Shanghai, etc..

Having just come from Kauai, we really enjoyed how remote and pristine the north shore of Oahu was (a trip down to over-commercialized, noisy, polluted Waikiki for New Year's Eve festivities confirmed that for us). I agree with the reviewers who said that Turtle Bay Resort is a 2-star hotel in a 5-star setting, but the setting makes it all worthwhile! Not only is the resort located on an amazing coastline (with monster waves the days we were there--not great for swimming but great for spotting 20-foot waves and surf champions), the North Shore of Oahu has preserved its laid-back way of life. Groups of surfers ambling along with their boards tucked under their arms, children bicycling alongside the road, fruit stands selling fresh pineapples and leis, homemade pickled mango stands and shacks selling burgers and hotdogs to famished beachgoers--staying at the North Shore is adopting for awhile the attitude that nothing is important enough to stress over. It was tough to get to from Waikiki due to the 1-land road, but I'm happy that is so, because I'll be very sad when the North Shore becomes commercialized. Turtle Bay resort itself was just fine. Not great, but not bad. The property is a bit older, and it is starting to show. We arrived late and were put into a very nice, large, clean room on the 2nd floor with the worst view possible--basically a slate roof, with a peek at the ocean beyond. I called down to the front desk immediately and was told (pleasantly) that they were full for the night, but if I stopped by the desk the next morning I could get a room on a higher floor. I did just that, and the sweet-mannered clerk immediately put me into a room on the 6th floor, with a view of the beach. When we transferred over, we saw that we had a much smaller lanai and the room itself was smaller and dingier, with dirtier caulking in the bathroom and (strangely enough) worse amenities. I think this is because the South Tower was renovated a longer time ago, so next time I would ask for a high floor in one of the other towers. Also, the housekeeping wasn't as thorough as at some of the other 4 or 5-star hotels I've stayed at. Nonetheless, the simply furnished room and laid-back, friendly Hawaiian style service was perfect for a beach stay. Who wants to stay at a stuffy ritz-carlton resort when the vacation is all about being sandy and suntanned and relaxing? Other things to note: we loved Ola, the restaurant on the beach, which had amazing views and great food, especially the garlic edamame. Lei Lei's was just okay (pretty ordinary and not a great location), and Hang Ten had terrible food but great drinks and amazing views of surfers/waves. Foodland market and Starbucks is about 10 minutes down Kamehaha Highway (take a right turn exiting the resort). There is an empty fridge so get all your drinks and snacks and store it in your room to avoid paying for expensive bottled water. Last, its not worth going to Waikiki!

The hotel is amazing. Located on one the most beautiful and secluded spots on the North Shore complete with surfers, sandy beaches, and (2) 18 Championship golf courses. Like others have pointed out, its pricey but in my opinion worth every dollar. Just for comparison, it was the same as the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu was for the same 10 nights. I know this because I cancelled my reservation at the Hilton and came out here. Best decision I ever made. Rooms: It's not the Venetian in Vegas folks so it is what it is. Similar to a Hilton/Sheraton standard room. I had a 6th floor room with balcony overlooking the pool and sunset beach. Outstanding 180 degree view of the pacific ocean. Maid service was excellent and room service fast and hot. Pools/Beaches: Incredible pools and beach. Ocean water was 78 degrees. Pool water was 65-75 depending on which pool you went in. Also they have (2) jacuzzis which were easily available and a small waterslide for kids and adults that dumps into a small pool with a waterfall. When you're not swimming you can watch the surfers ride the waves about 50 yard away or order food/drinks at the pool. People were partying which was nice. There is also a bar at the pool with plasma tvs too. Golf: I went for golf. Played both the Palmer and Fazio courses twice each, Place was empty so I had no problem teeing off whenever I wanted. I played either at 8am or 2pm to avoid the heat and strong sun of midday. Courses are really nice and really hard especially the Palmer Course. It hosts the Sr PGA in Jan. so its a challenging track. Fazio is a bit more open but still a good test. Tees, Fairways, Greens on both were manicured to perfection. Had a private lesson and it was perfect. Larry is a great Pro. Teahes to your ability and style and really cared about how I played after the lesson and was always offering help. Pro shop and staff were great and professional. Say hello to Andy and the rest of the guys who take the bags. Tip them, they deserve it. Food/Drink: I ate virtually all my meals at Lei Lei's at the golf course, Its cheaper, better tasting and a better value than the room service or the restaurants. That's just my opinion but you decide. Say hello to Ian, Tyler, Lalani (sp) and the rest of the staff who work the bar/restaurant. Lei Lei's is a great place to hang and share a drink after a round of golf or a nightcap. Summary: Turtle Bay was an amazing vacation for me. All I will say is that it can be pricey if you partake in everything here. Golf, horseback riding, spa treatments, at great restaurants cost alot so expect to pay for it. If you're looking for a Motel 6 value then this isn't for you. It's an upscale hotel in a very secluded part of Oahu. There is no reason to leave this place once you get there so sit back and enjoy it. Go for a swim, take a horseback ride and relax and stop worrying what it will cost.

All the fees and other charges to the room were too much I booked a long time ago for my honeymoon and for two night with all the fees I paid about $800. However the resort grounds was beautiful, Learned how to surf and it is hard. The room was average but spacious and if I were to go back I would visit but not stay.

We were rather disappointed with our stay. From the beginning, we were made to wait in line to check in, while there was just one person working behind the desk. This made for a slow moving line, especially when he was also required to answer the front desk phone. This was not a good start to our vacation, a comment that was shared by another couple while we all waited in line. Once we made it to our room, we were not impressed. We had booked a Deluxe Ocean View room, and while we could see the ocean, most of our view was of the roof below. The room itself didn\u2019t seem to have any of the amenities that one would expect from a resort. The shampoo and conditioner were no better than what you\u2019d see at a Marriott. The sheets and towels were low quality, and our shower wasn\u2019t cleaned properly. Also, the idea of charging $3 for bottles of water on top on our room rate is preposterous. And then a $15 charge to use the showers after we\u2019d checked out? While the grounds lived up to a bit more of the standards one holds for a resort, I would still call them far from stellar. The swimming pool was ice cold, it would have been a refreshing treat had we been able to bare the temperature. The towel cards were quite a nuisance, shouldn\u2019t a resort allow guests to the luxury of more than one towel at a time? Overall, we left Turtle Bay vowing not to come back, and to share with our friends who may be traveling to North Shore that renting a beach house is a much better route to go. It\u2019s a shame that TBR is taking advantage of its monopoly as the only hotel in the area, and giving their guests the bare minimum.

First off, this is one of the more expensive properties to stay at on the North Shore of Oahu. We arrived to find that while the hotel had undergone cosmetic upgrades, it was in somewhat run down condition. Other than new paint throughout there were many signs that the building was more than 25 years old. Cracked concrete, peeling wallpaper in the hallways, carpet seams that were coming apart etc. Behind the reception desk there were dirty handprints down the walls leading to the office, just odd for a 4 star property. The reception desk personnel had problems finding our reservation even though we had made it months before. When we finally got checked in we went to our room and found that the carpets and bedding were damp, likely from salt air making its way through the ventillation system. The room also had a musty odor. There was rust on anything that was steel in the room such as light switch plates,sprikler heads etc. When we complained we were offered two other rooms that were just as damp as the first room. It took us a full day and much effort to get this hotel to offer a refund for the second night. We were lied to by the night manager about who could authorize the refund (He told us that it would have to come from Expedia, not true!) Aside from one day manager, the front end staff in this hotel are not well trained. We had to pay an extra $ 15 dollars for parking, went out for dinner the first night and came back to find that there was no parking. In short, if you truly know what quality properties are like then you best avoid this hotel. If you don't mind 2 - 3 star properties and don't mind paying $200-300/night then this hotel is fine.

The first time we had a deluxe room in the main hotel, that was great, this time we decided on a suite. The 11th hour we decided up up grade to a cottage and so glad we did. Also, extended to five nights instead of three. The cottages are expensive, but well worth it. They are spacious, very clean and private, or so we thought. Several times when we were sitting on our back deck, enjoying quiet, hotel guests would stop and ask about the cottage. Fine. But, we were rather upset when someone walked into our cottage to see it. People staying in the cottages spend alot of money to do so and one reason is for selclusion, not be be bothered by other guests. People who want to view the cottages need to ask at the front desk. This is in no way a reflection on the hotel. Just beware cottage dwellers. We ate at all the restaurants except Ola's. All we very good, service was good. Giovannis shrimp truck, was not very good, would not go back . They run out of everything too. Go to the shrimp trucks early. Ted's bakery is very good. The Pipeline and Sunset Beach are wonderful. Make sure you have a car, convertable is the best and worth the extra $$. The pool water is rather cool, and I agree does need new tiles. Hot tub could be bigger and one was not working. We went to the spa and had a couples massage. Very nice. Back to the cottage, aside from the above noted problem, they are wonderful. Directly on the beach. Hammocks available for sunsets or just to relax. The private butler was awsome. They will fill your tub for a hot bath with candles and champagne. Bring you ice, make dinner reservations for you, anything. They arranged for a private dinner on our deck at sunset. Complete with white linen tablecloths, candles, flowers and champage. This is what TB is all about. It was very romantic. The luxury and service in the cottages are worth every penny. We will return in a couple years and stay in the cottage again.

We had room 620-try and request this room, BEST views from balcony. SEE PHOTOS. Sunset sun up every morning!! The balcony is amazing-the views even better!! ONLY DOWNFALL: Pillows-the pillows are bad. AND do not leave fruit in room, there are alot of fruit flys. Hotel-WOW! The lobby will leave you gasping for air!! Pools- AWESOME! Never crowded-one heated one refreshing. One pool slide, great drinks by the pool, great scenery! Resturants: Ate at them all, 21 definitly my fav but very pricy. WORTH IT. Lei Leis was our best meal. The pool bar had pool food, and the Palm Terrace is where we ate breakfast every morning. It came with our package-of you can get that buffet, do it! WOW, great selection and very tasty! It will keep you filled until dinner! STAFF: FRIENDLY, helpful ENTERTAINMENT: Well, there really is not any here at the hotel. This is our downfall on the Hotel. Friday nights there is a Lua Show. ADVISE: Rent a car! Once you arrive in Honolulu take the route up towards Halewai and the Dole Pineapple grounds-less sceneic, but NEED to see. Start your vacation off by stopping in Halewai (15 minutes from Hotel) and get a Matsomodos shaved ice--get it with ice cream and beans..OH MY GOSH! The best! One day (Full Day) take the scenic route, east on 83 in otherwards make a left out of the resort and spend the day at the Waimaile waterfalls. It is an all day affair-DO NOT FORGET bug spray and good water shoes! It is worth the trip. You can swim in the bath of the falls at the end. It is hard to find, one tip: When you get to a black bench towards the end, go down the steep stairs, go into the river and follow it left, there you will find the falls! One day drive to Pearl Harbor, well this is imporessive-brought me to tears! We left the Hotel at 7:30 Got there at 8:30 left at 3:00, went to the Dole Pantation and headed to Halewai for a sunset dinner at Jameson's by the Sea. WOW...Awesome! Great place to eat!! We also went to Sharks Cove for snorkeling, GREAT snorkeling...a little dangerous. Go to Turtle Beach to swim with Sea Turtles, that was neat!! Sunsets, Sunset Beach--- We tried Giovannis shrimp truck, I think we are the only ones that did not like it. For grovereies, go to FOODMART-there is one left or right out of the resort. There is a Starbucks on the one to your right. Get a card, free it will save you a bundle of money! Things to see: The \"Biouj\" somethingTemple-Dole Pineapple-Waterfall-Macadamia Outlet-Turtles- Lua-Polynesian Cultural Center...For a few drinks go to Breakers in Halewai--it is a little more hip, music dancing sometimes ect... The Hotel just put in while we were there many more unbrellas on the beach. The snorkeling is not good here, but the neach itself is breathtaking!!!

The tile around the swimming pool is cracked and in some places tiles are missing. Hotel staff are friendly and willing to please. Most of all, staying at Turtle Bay means you're captive to eating in one of the resorts restaurants. There are no decent restaurants in the immediate area. Yes there's a McDonald's 20 minutes away and several local places but nothing worth writing home about. Turtle Bay's restaurants are expensive. Expect to spend a lot for what I would term an average meal at any of the six restaurants. The best deal is the evening buffet for $28. It's offered 3 or 4 nights each week. In addition, if you can add on to your vacation package the free morning breakfast buffet do it. This will save you money and start your day off on the right foot.

After reading about the renovation and excellent reviews in the guides, and paying $580 plus per night for the cabanas, I was expecting similar experiences to maybe Parrot Cay or Banyan Tree or Amanyara or a 4 Seasons. It was not to be! The location is wonderful and if you like walking, you can get to almost-deserted beaches surrounded by forests right out of the main area. Yet the quality of service and the experiences would have been acceptable if I'd paid $150 a night, but not for what they charge. The company that owns the resort seems solely interested in making the most money as possible, and I also had a feeling (although not corroborated) that they do not employ many local Hawaiians. They sub-contract many of their services, which are sub-standard and nobody seems to know much about them anyway, their excuse always was that \"they are another company\". The rental bikes (at $16 for 1.15 hrs) were falling appart and the outfit that rents them very unfriendly. We had pre-arranged kayak rentals and was shocked to discover on the day that I needed to drive to another location 30 mins away to rent them as this so-called resort does not rent them. When we arrived to the resort, the check-in person failed to give us any information, or breakfast vouchers, and check-out took more than one hour as we had to cancel a charge. In themselves, these problems were minor and I would normally not be bothered by them, but they soon started to accumulate. The spa was another experience of sub-contractors being incompetent (we had 2 massages booked at the same time and they failed to tell us that the same masseur would be doing them, thus one having to wait in the corridor for one hour before getting the massage). And the spa's location feels almost like it's in a parking lot, not particularly relaxing. The gym is OK, but again, nothing compared to what you find in other establishments were you pay $580 per night. As for the cabanas, I liked the fact that you could walk directly to the door without having to get into elevators, etc. And, being directly opposite the beach was great (btw, the beautiful beach in front of the cabanas is very rocky and not safe for swimming). But I am not that sure that they offer that much more than the bigger rooms in the main building. In fact, the cabanas were quite strange in that they are huge but very dark. The bathrooms have been re-done and are lovely and comparable to nice European hotels, as is the amazing and superior huge bed. But everything else just looked like it belonged to a motel room. And they also charge $15 per day extra for services that most people do not use or that other hotels provide for free. So all in all, I maybe had a problem with expectations related to the reviews and the price. And there are some great things about TBR.

We loved it and I promised my husband and son that the following year we\u2019d stay here. This year we did. We loved it! We stayed for two nights and 3 days before finishing our trip at Waikiki. I wish we had never left to Waikiki. I could have spent the entire 12 days for our Hawaii vacation at TBR. When you check in you will see a beautiful lobby. When you book do it through their website for the best deals. Keep checking for great deals they change often. Our room was on the 6th floor next to the presidential suite with sweeping views of the ocean. My favorite thing about this resort is that you could sit on the beach or float in the pool and see nothing but ocean and trees on either side of the hotel. It is not like crazy wild crowded Waikiki. The sign on the TBR says the true Hawaii and it is true you feel like it is the true Hawaii. I plan on retuning next year. This time we will stay at least 5 nights. The stay here is like being in paradise. The restaurants were all great. We ate at 21 degrees north, Ola, Lei\u2019Leis and the Terrace for breakfast. They have 3 buildings.

We started off with one of the best Mai Tais we had. Extra strong and extra tasty. We had an appetizer but can\u2019t recall what is was now! Our son had the Lobster (from the adult menu) he actually had the most expensive dish on the menu. His lobster was $46 My husband and I had a wonderful Hawaiian fish that they prepare with an amazing yellow curry (Hawaiian Moi Filet Nori Wrapped and Pan Seared with Peanut Oil, Saut\u00e9ed Shiitake, Spinach, Jasmine Rice, Yellow Thai Curry, Coconut Cream Sauce 31.00 Nobilo, Sauvignon Blanc, New Zealand 10.00) I highly recommend it. We would sleep listening to the crashing of the waves. I recommend going to the Polynesian Cultural Center. It is great fun and worth every penny. My family and I really love all the cultural things and learning about other cultures. This is always a highlight for us. As you all know who have been there, the show from Samoa is great. The guy who does the show is also the star of the evening show \u201cHorizons\u201d. His name is Kap Teo and is very funny as well as very talented and the best fire dancer. At the end of the night we were very pleased to speak with him and purchase some of his art. He is a great artist. Dinner was wonderful. We did not do the Luau at PCC or eat there but instead went back to the resort to eat at their restaurant called OLA. It is on the beach and beautiful. We had Hawaiian fish (why eat anything else n Hawaii?). Miso Butterfish Saut\u00e9ed Hamakua Mushrooms, Wilted Spinach and Kabayaki Butter $25.95 with Suggested Wine Pairing: Merry Vale Chardonnay . It was delicious and the service was wonderful. Back to the incredible evening show \u201cHorizons\u201d. After the show it was short 10-15 minute drive to our resort. It was sort of funny after the show because everyone, and do mean everyone, clears out right after for the long drive back to Waikiki. The gift shops are deserted so we wandered around then had that great talk with Kap Teo. Breakfast at Lei Leis. We had the famous breakfast croissant which is delicious and reasonably priced. We took it to go and ate it at one of the tables of Ola on the beach, which is closed since they only open for dinner. After Breakfast we took a walk on the Kulima Cove side. Other must do\u2019s in North shore: Do not miss Romy\u2019s Shrimp Hut or Aoki\u2019s Shave Ice and Waimea Audubon Centre Gardens and waterfall.

We had a multi island trip (Maui, Big Island and Oahu). Everyone told me to pass on Oahu but I wanted to visit Pearl Harbor so we booked Turtle Bay to be away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu. Honolulu is fun to visit but I was glad we stayed in the country. We're not big on night life. Join the Preferred Hotels club and you will get a better rate on this hotel. Our room was very nice. I found the service to be acceptable but not as good as at the Four Seasons on Maui or Mauna Kea on Big Island. The laundry here is a plus. We found the tennis here to be so-so. We ate at Ola's and Lei Lei's. The ambience at Ola's was great but the food was mediocre. The food at Lei Lei is great. We really loved the North Shore and the trip up there - via either way. Haleiwa is pretty. We ate at Jameson's there one night. The food was decent and the location very nice. We missed seeing the Polynesian Center. It rained the afternoon we originally planned to visit and we thought we'd visit Sunday. Unfortunately, it is closed Sunday. Pearl Harbor is worth visiting. They are serious about not bringing any bags or pocketbooks. You can bring a wallet and carry your camera. Leave everything else in the car. When we visited in mid-late Sept there was no need to go early in the morning to get a ticket. We walked in late afternoon and jumped on a tour. One tip is to be very careful driving up to the North Shore. The highway is one way each way. It is easy to have a fender bender. Our rental car was rear ended when we stopped at a cross walk to let a lady and her baby cross. Be careful and try to leave plenty of room between you and people ahead of you and behind you. We saw lots of other similar accidents. Last thoughts...this would be a stunning place for destination wedding. They have a glass chapel at water's edge. We saw a beautiful wedding there one night.

Nice sized pools and Jacuzzi. Plenty of beach right on premise. Golfing very nice. Tennis courts very nice. Do horseback ride its beautiful at night during sunset. Surf Lessons at Hans Hedeman at hotel- ASh was our instructor we caught a wave and surfed on the first try. Explore the beachs they are beautiful. Waimea beach has cliff jumping, Pupukea beach is nice and not very crowded, Hukilau beach was also very beautiful. Shop- if you like to shop go to Waikiki and shop the strip and Ala Moana mall. By far the mist beautiful mall, with every designer store and tons of eating places not to mention the Mai Tai Bar for great cocktails. Don Ho Show- Funny show but hes old and does not sing much. Cute show though. Hawaiian Music- House w/out a Key at the Halekulani is outside with ocean breezes great cocktails, soothing Hawaiian music, and miss Hawaii dance to it. Soo relaxing. DINING outside of hotel LUNCH DUKEs Canoe Club- Yummy food and drinks with outside ocean view of Waikiki beach. Giovannis Shrimp Trunk- On the North Shore shrimp scampi soo tasty with tons of garlic. Look for the white truck and lots of people. Kui Aina- Haleiwa location- such big juicy fresh burgers and shoestring fries. DINNER Ciao Mein- Waikiki Hyatt- Awesome food and service. Chinese and Italian fusion. DK Steakhouse- Waikiki- The best steak you will ever have will melt like butter in your mouth, its dry aged. Try the blue cheese butter. Michels- Nice location, food overpriced better food at the previous to restaurants for half the cost. Pineapple Room- Macys- in Ala Moana Mall- yes its in a mall but its well worth the time to sit and eat. Everything from drinks to dessert is soo wonderful. Island Burgers- Ala Moana Mall- Great juicy burgers and chicken sandwiches. Large appertizers and large cocoktails. Haleiwa Joes- Haleiwa- Awesome view outside of Harbor. Great service. Great seafood and decently prices. Cholos Mexican- In the Northshore Marketplace Haleiwa- better more authentic mexican then from where I live and great mojitos and margartitas to boot. Also not expensive. Also try a Malasada, Portugese doughnut. From one of their many trucks randomly placed in Haleiwa town. HOTELS RESTAURANTS 21 DEGREES NORTH- Yummy 21 different martinis. Stephanie the bartender makes the best Mojitos on the Island, their strong too. The food is small so we ordered a lot but it was all very tasty. They are expensive though. OLA- My favorite of all. Right on the beach on hotel property. All open aired the ocean waves sing to you during your meal. At lunch its a great spot for munchies and margaritas. During dinner tieme the tiki torches light the beach. The Kalua pig nachos are the best get them. The Butterfish melts like Butter and the Salmon is sugarcane crusted with sweet corn. The dessert martinis are also very tasty and desserts are great as well. The service is wonderful, ask for Krissy if shes still there. She was super sweet. We went there four times in 7 days for lunch and dinner. LEI LEIS- By the golf course. The food was great. The drinks were great. The Chocolate Cookie dessert was soo yummy!!! PALM TERRACE- Great buffet, different theme nights. We loved it for a laid back night. The breakfast buffet is also great. HANG TEN- Pool bar. They make great Mai Tais!!! The Sashimi was great, the caesar salad good, the garlic fries yummy. The waitress service to your lounge chair was on point I never didnt have a drink in my hand. All in all I guess thats it!!!

That is what you are paying for:location. In contrast with Honolulu, there is no insane traffic and noise at all hours, here you will find privacy and peace (location wise). We saw black and white clown fish, seaturtles, and other abundant sea life. However, the rooms are lacking. The pictures shown on the hotel's web page put somewhat of a brighter glow on the condition of the rooms. We changed rooms because the first room we were assigned to had wet and musty carpet. The rooms are pretty dull and in need of another renovation. Amenities are strictly average. The best part of the room is the view of the ocean and the sound of the waves lulling you to sleep. Food was just ok. Service and food quality are best at LeiLei's. My major problem with this resort: COCKROACHES. They would crawl into the bathroom at night (we had to plug and block all drains), and we would find them in the room. The maids must not have done a very thorough job of cleaning because the dead bugs would still be there when we returned. We saw them in the hallways and in the buffet area on dining room chairs. On the last night of our stay, my fiance awoke to find one crawling on his face! When we approaced management about this issue, they vehemently insisted that it was impossible that there would be cockroaches as the hotel was regularly sprayed for bugs. Only when I offered to show the manager the pictures on my digital camera did he immediately change his tone. We were given a 25% discount off our stay. On a side note, definately check out Hanauma Bay when on Oahu. It is a beautiful snorkling spot and a great example of what nature can do when respected and left in peace. Please do not touch or step on the reefs, we saw many people breaking this rule and it was very sad....", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allen, TX", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay, with only a few negatives...\u201d", "Author": "sahdoggiemom", "ReviewID": "UR5790422", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Turtle Bay Resort September 1-4 which, in retrospect, was the worst time to schedule a romantic getaway. We had forgotten that it was Labor Day weekend and as such, the property was overrun (literally) with locals and their children. They dominated the entire property and made the pool areas incredibly stressful due to their screeching and yelling and rowdiness. This isn't the resort's fault, but keep in mind that in Hawaii, they like to get away on holidays as well and usually wind up at one of the local resorts. When we went back to the resort the following Thursday, all of the locals were gone and the resort was back to it's serene self. We'll remember this next time, and hope others can learn from our mistake. We did have a snafu at check-in, which always seems ten times worse at the time, especially after an 8-hour flight. I had reserved a king cottage, but when we checked in were given a double queen. While I understood bedding was not guaranteed, I indicated in the \"guest requests\" area of the reservation form and also contacted the Ho'okipa concierge (exclusive to the cottages) that this was a delayed anniversary trip (my husband had recently returned from Iraq) and we wanted one bed in our room. We finally were moved to a double queen (after way more begging than my husband should have had to do), and our personal concierge was great, but we only saw him once - upon reassignment to the new room. We did also experience a billing problem upon checkout, as it seems they forgot to check us out of the old room so we were being billed twice for everything. When we discovered this, we personally walked down to the front desk around 6 a.m. with the hopes of handling the issue in person, but were told it would have to be fixed later as the system wouldn't allow him to update our account. Huh? The cottages are beautiful and are well worth the price if you can manage to nail down a discounted rate, which we were able to do - $479 one night, and $541 the other two nights. Discounted of course, being a relative term and these rates did not count tax or the resort fee (please Turtle Bay, just roll that into the price so we don't feel like we're being nickle and dimed). The only other downside was the cottage next to us was occupied by no less than 8 people (locals), as we counted them coming in and leaving for half our stay. They weren't loud...but it just gave the place an air of tackiness as they played football in the green areas and ran around the area in front of the cottages like it was their front yard. I'd expect this in Vegas, but not in Hawaii. We immensely enjoyed our couples massage at Spa Luana, The facility is very nice, and the showers, steam room and open-air \"relaxation area\" were wonderful. Sure, it's pricey, but we felt we got more bang for our buck here than we did a couple of years ago at the Mandara Spa at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We dined at Ola two nights, and our only negative is it seemed like our poor waiter was the only person working. There were wedding receptions being held both times we had dinner and it appeared as though too many folks were assigned to the receptions (of no more than 20 people) and one person got the rest of the guests. Strange. A word of advice - if you see tables set up for a reception, ask when you arrive to be seated away from the reception. We did get a bit of a glare when we requested this the second night, but our first evening's dinner was bruised and the romance killed by dealing with hovering reception guests snapping photos and blocking our view of the sand and ocean and generally getting into our personal dining space. The food was very good, but the mai tai's were rather weak. Go for the local beer, and you'll be better off. We also dined at Lei Lei's twice for lunch...can't beat the view of a beautiful golf course, and the food was fantastic. We never made it there for dinner, but hear that's the place to go for dinner. Overall, we had a wonderful vacation and are planning on staying in one of the villas next time, if we can swing it. If you visit the Turtle Bay Resort, be sure to get over to the actual Turtle Bay and watch the turtles come in to feed each day. They wandered in around 12:45 p.m. each day during our stay and stuck around for about 45 minutes. They truly are amazing creatures!

All rooms are ocean view and the south wing rooms all have a slight view of a conference room roof and a small lanai with just one chair. But as I found out when I complained \u201call rooms in the south wing - Kuilima Bay \u2013 can see the roofs from the lanais but they have the better bay/water/sun views\u201d. They offered to move us, showed me the room on a map and we decided to stay right where we were. Good decision because after we walked around the resort we saw that the south wing had the better views for sure. The other wings do have larger lanais with two chairs instead of one \u2013 to some people that would make all the difference but to us it did not matter much as we just pulled one of the room chairs to the slider door and peace was restored. We further like our decision to stay where we were because each day at 1:00 the turtles came in to Kuilima Bay right in front of our room. They hung around 30 \u2013 45 minutes eating algae and then off they went. Everyday like clockwork. The rooms are not that great d\u00e9cor wise but they are quiet, clean and the views are great. The beds are very comfy but a big down comforter that we promptly took off the bed for the entire stay. There were extra blankets of a normal weight in the closet so we put that one on the bed and I am happy to say that each day when housekeeping came, they left our bed that way and thankfully did not put back the down comforter back on the bed. The waves that were crashing all night outside our slider (which we left open all night ) was so peaceful and romantic but when we got home we had a hard time sleeping because there were no waves crashing outside our bedroom. The staff was great, very helpful, very friendly and we had no trouble with the resort staff at all. I must say that the views at TB, as nice as they are, can not compare with Kapalua Bay on Maui where we stay when on Maui, and where we were married on a seaside cliff in 2000. It has been torn down now for timeshares and our hearts were broken by that news but thankfully they can not take away the cliff we were married on. If you cancel anything at TB, recheck your bill on the t.v. before you get ready to check out so that you don't have to wait for corrections. We cancelled our seaside couples Lomi Lomi massage due to the weather but also because the gazebo has no roof so everyone walking by looks right in on you. We were still charged the $240 and we also had $43.20 on our bill from the spa. We had no spas services on this trip but I am happy to say that they did reverse them right away. Also, one night free valet was included in our package, and then you could self-park for free. Well, we were charged for the valet for every night - but again they reversed. All in all a great experience at TB and the north shore is heaven \u2013 Here a few things that we did on the north shore: There is a great place when you leave the resort heading towards Foodland, etc. that will be on the left side, directly across the street from the parking lot for Sunset Beach I think. They sell ice cold coconuts and pineapples. Look for the sign. Get one, take it to your room, make a Mai Tai in it and make yourself happy. Be sure to hit the little shopping center, also on your left as you head towards Foodland from the resort, with the big totem pole and little shops. You can't miss it - probably about 2 miles and a huge totem pole. Cool place with great deals. There is a booth directly in the front with great bead bracelets for $1 each. Ted's Bakery - About 2 miles from resort heading towards Foodland on the left. Go for breakfast but you MUST go early or you won't get in - if that happens at least go by for pastries and good stuff for your room - OMG. Whatever you do DO NOT eat at the burger stand directly across from Sharks Cove. 99% sure it is called Sharks Cove Burgers - The worse burger I have ever had - it was cardboard on a stale bun, with old lettuce. Mayonnaise and Mustard packets sitting out in the sun, warm when put on burger \u2013 yuck. My hubby got the Ahi sandwich (or some fish sandwich - they only had one) and it was bad but he ate it. Such a guy. Snorkel Sharks Cove \u2013 lots of fish and turtles too. Crystal clear, beautiful water but not the easiest of descents down the hill to the shore. You should wear river shoes for sure and entering the water is a task also. Due to living in San Diego we snorkel a lot but even with all our experience you must be careful at Sharks Cove. The water is crystal clear, full of rocks, ledges, and people. It is safe but you must be aware. Waimea Bay \u2013 famous in the Beach Boys song \u2013 you must go. The softest, most white sand with sailboats anchored bobbing in the waves. Picture perfect with a great cliff top park too. Then go to the Waimea Audubon Society Nature Preserve directly across the street from the Waimea Beach parking lot. The hike is a short \u00be mile walk through the preserve, beautiful grounds and they have a great gift shop, as well as food stands. Big Macadamia trees right by the parking lot with birds in the road waiting to eat the nuts after a cars goes through and breaks the shells. I think those are the hardest shell in the world and my hubby used a vice for the nuts from our macadamia tree at our old house. We do not have a mac tree at our new home \u2013 sadness sets it \u2013 let us move on. I also bought 2 fantastic Island Scrap booking Kits that are all island themed, in at the gift shop. Shaved Ice from Matsumotos (not sure on spelling) or Aoki in Haleiwa- both on right as you come in to Haleiwa. Be sure to add ice cream and Azuki beans to the bottom to make a real Hawaiian Shaved Ice \u2013 can you say yummy. Haleiwa is a great town. Haleiwa Joe\u2019s gets rave reviews on this site so we went while in town. We sat 10 minutes without a glass of water, menu or acknowledgement from the waitress so we got up and left. Yes, they were busy but we were in the bar and the bartender was right there, seeing us and not even nodding a hello. There is not a place in this world that is worth being ignored and there are just too many choices to be ignored around the north shore. Garlic Shrimp from Giovanni\u2019s Shrimp Truck \u2013 They have 3 types of shrimp but they were out of their Lemon and their Spicy - but I hear they are incredible too. That was ok because we wanted the garlic anyhow. The Smoothie shack that is next to Gionvanni\u2019s is great and perfect accompaniment to garlic shrimp. When you get to the end of the TB driveway to leave going somewhere you will make a left heading towards the town of Kahuku and it is a mile or two on the left. You will pass other shrimp trucks and Romi\u2019s is good too from what we hear, but Giovanni\u2019s was so good we never made it there. Just keep a look out for the sign and the truck. Dinner - 21 Degrees at TB - make sure to have the peanut coconut curry shrimp \u2013 omg. All food, appetizers, drinks and service were perfect. Hang 10 Bar \u2013 poolside at TB \u2013 great Mai Tais, hamburgers and garlic fries - Tell Eddie hi and order your Mai Tai from him, he makes the best and we tried them all \u2013 LOL Helicopter tour with Josh at Paradise - on TB resort - do the 1 hour Oahu tour - take your camcorder as they do not offer a video for purchase. On the way out the coast will be on the person seated behind Josh the pilot for your picture/camcorder opportunities. Horse back ride - on TB resort - do the morning ride. Ask for Jerry the horse \u2013 he was in Open Range with Kevin Costner and my husband had him on our ride. I had Casper, a big, gentle sweet horse with mind of his own when it comes to grass! You go past the world\u2019s largest Banyan tree (larger than the one on Maui that is world famous) and is the Banyan tree that they hid in on the t.v. show Lost when the polar bear was after them all. A lot of the show Lost is filmed at TB and the whole series is shot on the north shore from what I understand. They had just removed the plane wreckage before we arrived but we can not wait for the new season so we can see that tree again. Just saw the tail end of Open Range the other night and saw Jerry at the end of the movie he is pulling a wagon across a meadow and then the movie ends. Lei Lei\u2019s \u2013 TB Golf Course \u2013 They will take you down from the resort in a golf cart and then you ask your server to call for them to pick you up. We went our first night and I did not like their Caesar Salad (ice box cold as if it had been made for a long time to get that cold, and it was slightly wilted) or the Coconut Shrimp which was dark brown from over frying as well as old oil and did not good taste at all but my hubby loved his seafood scampi. Believe it or not they had bad Pina Coladas but great Lava Flows and Mai Tais. We had to go back a second time and hubby had the seafood scampi again as it was all he thought about it all week. That is how good it was and I had the vegetable scampi, add grilled chicken and it was fantastic too. Ola\u2019s \u2013 on the beach at TB resort \u2013 really great food, great service, open air dining with no walls only a roof. Everything we ate was good and it is directly on the sand to the side of the resort. Their Yukon Gold mashed potatoes make you want a whole plate load they are so good. Their filet mignon is to die for. Palm Terrace \u2013 we never did any eating there except to do the breakfast buffet which was included in our deal but it was incredible and changed every few days. That was nice since we were there so long to have more choices for breakfast. They made one of the best made to order omelets I have had! The Bay Club \u2013 in the lobby of the TB resort had the worse Hawaiian Pizza we have ever eaten. Besides being cold it was not good. Came to find out they order it in from another place and have it brought it. Fun place though with pool tables, shuffle board and darts Having trouble with the pictures but I will attempt to upload again in this review. I was trying to upload 10 so I wiil try just the three in the spaces provided while doing the review. It did not work last time but I guess you get a link in the email from TA once they uploaded the review and i am not even sure it went through so I am doing the review again with this paragraph added.

After 40 minutes, Expedia finally picked up part of the tab. It was $20+ per person for brunch. Another annoying charge was the parking. We had a mini-van for the six of us that took ONE parking space. Since we had two rooms, we were charged for TWO spaces. It was $15 per spot per day. The resort charged a fee for tennis court and snorkel gear use for 2 hours. It was $12 per room per day. It did not matter that we brought our own gear and did not use the courts, we had to paid $24 per day for both rooms. Since we stayed for six nights, the extra charges added up to be $240. About the room, don't touch the stuff animal turtle. My daughter thought it was a welcome gift and took the tag off. I think we were charged another $25 for it. We had reserved rooms that were in the \"Premium Ocean Front Delux\" with 180 degrees ocean view. Don't bother doing that. Most of the hotel has an ocean view. Furthermore, even though we were on the higher floors (not too many floors at this hotel) we overlooked a patio cover. The hotel would not move us. Even though the property was nice. With the extra charges, tax and surcharges, we paid over $700 per night for two rooms. Even though it's not outrageous, the nickeling and diming aspect of the hotel was annoying. Local places, Waimea bay is nice in the summer. In the winter, the undercurrent can be dangerous for some-and definitely for kids. Lots of drowning so be aware. Pipeline surfing contest is fun to watch. For snacks and drinks -Foodland market is great. Waimea Park is great for first timers. Lots of birds and local plants and flowers. As for attractions and dining in Hawaii, pick up THE ENTERTAINMENT BOOK- HAWAII EDITION. We've visited the Polynesian Cultural center a couple of times. I think it opens at noon or one. The first time years ago, we booked the tour, luau, and show with the package price of maybe $100 per person. In 4-06, we used the entertainment coupon that saved us 25 percent per person for the Admission and show. I think we paid $35 per person. We left the facilities and had dinner outside of the center since there was a gap of about 1-1/2 hours between tours and show. A local recommended the L&L BBQ (fast food place) with great Mahi Mahi and, Teriyaki beef/chicken or burgers-$5 per person-no kidding. The food was great, but the place was a dump. Not a good place for people who want great atmosphere. When we attended the luau the first time, the food was awful-not worth the price. The dancing at the luau was a duplicate on a smaller scale as compared to the show at night-fantastic and shorter recently that when we saw it for the first time years ago- thank goodness. After a while it all looked the same. Other places to eat are at the hotel, prices were okay $30-$40 per person for dinner, lunch was reasonable $8-$15 for an entree. The town Haleiwa has a couple of good restaurants, $25 per person for dinner-great food. Other hot tips for Oahu with the entertainment book: PARADISE COVE LUAU: Cheaper to drive than to do the bus tour if you have a big party. The book gives a 25% discount up to four people. Only thing is that traffic is awful going to the west side of the island, so leave early. We booked the tour directly with the Paradise Cove and got the middle package (flower lei, 4 drinks pp, and preferred seating. Since most people booked through the bus tour companies, we had great seats-one row behind the premium group that paid a lot more. They reserved our seats so it was not a problem that we arrived late. Once you are there, get in line for the canoe ride if you have kids, otherwise you will not be able to do it. The tour on the USS Arizona and the MISSOURI- great prices with the book and save. Get there by 9am or you will have a problem with parking. Nautilus submarine: Buy one, get one free ($80+ per adult). This was great. Restuarants in the book - MATTEO'S (yummy), KOBE's TEPPAN- (like a Benhana's but 1/2 the price). I came here as a kid and had fond memories. My children love this place. If you get in before 6pm, meals are cheap $12 instead of $20 for the basics. You can also use the entertainment card and get one meal free for the fancier items. A bunch of places at the Hilton Hawaiian Village are in the book. Fun, great food but pricey. The card helps. For big families/groups you can use up to three if you are not too shy. Just hand the card(s) to the waiter at the end of dinner when you ask for the bill and they will adjust off up to 3 dinners/meals. Not in the book- The Shore Bird at the Outrigger fun for families. DON\"T MISS this place: JOHN DOMINIS Sunday brunch. $29 or $35 per adult and $14 for kids. We always come here. Amazing food. Dinner is very pricey $90+ per entree. Make reservations. STUFF TO DO: Go to Hanama Bay. Beautiful place to snorkel. The fishes will swim up to you. Parking can be bad so leave early. The attendants for the parking can be morons. They don't check to see if spaces are available and will wave you away. So park down the hill on the residential street and walk up- It's about 1/2 mile uphill. The price is $5 for entrance. For the windsurfers, Kailua on the East side is fabulous. The beach is beautiful. For the surfers or kids that want to learn, \"Mad Dog\" who owns a shop between the Hilton Hawaiian and the Outrigger was great. After my daughter's one-hour lesson with him, he gave her permission to hang out if she wanted to and get tips on surfing when he gave other lessons. One hour lesson $50 or $60. Another hot tip- The OUTRIGGER HOTELS: Before we bought our timeshare at The Hilton (due to the terrible experience at the Turtle Bay) we stayed at the Outrigger frequently. It was a little more than 1/2 price with the entertainment book depending on availability Instead of $225-$250 per night. It ranged from $139-$169. There are four restaurants on the premise. Good food for cheap. Call them directly or go to the web site under specials and click on travel club rates ( better than AAA by $$$$) Thanks for your attention. There are lots more in the Entertainment book. Get it on Entertainment(--)or stop by Borders on Nimitz HWY and pick one up when you are leaving the airport for you hotel.

We also had dinner at Lei Lei\u2019s and burgers, nachos and drinks at The Bay Club. Both were good. The large pool was rather cool and not many people used it but the smaller pools were warmer.

Could not get a shuttle nor a taxi to take us there. Getting around the island was somewhat of a challenge at times. There seemed to be road construction on EVERY highway we traveled.

Most of the restaurants had the same type of menu, however the food was good at all of them. We had a bad experience with Room Service when they messed up one entree and did not return with the correct one for 30 minutes. When we received the meal, nothing was done, not even a free dessert. After contacting the front desk, they apologized and took care of the bill. We had the breakfast buffet each morning because it came with our package. It had a nice variety of fruits, pastries, juices and hot items. If you plan to go snorkeling, we found a great place called \"Three tables\".

The Hotel was happy to accomodate us. Unfortunately, they sent us to a room that had gotten mixed up and had yet to be cleaned by housekeeping. I promptly called down to the front desk where the lady was incredibly appologetic. She told us they were going to upgrade us, free of charge, for the inconvience. The bell hop picked us up in from of the hotel with our luggage loaded into a beautiful golf cart. The beach cottage was amazing. Hard wood floors, veranda, huge bath tub, gorgeous shower, hammocks and tiki torches and the fluffiest beds I have ever stayed in... and I have stayed at some fabulous hotels! We also had our own personal concierge, who brought us local juices, water and champagne. That night the staff came and did a turn down service and left cookies by our bed. This hotel was absolutely incredible! Make sure that you book a beach cottage, it really makes a difference in your stay. - On the downside, there seemed to be a lot of children and families, and for honeymooners, not the right atmosphere in June. The Beach cottage offers a large amount of seclusion, which is fabulous. And the golf course was great. My husband played the Palmer course at twilight and I drove the golf cart and kept score.

The scenic views, beaches, and coves are among the nicest we've ever seen. There are hiking trails on the property which take you to sites you'll recognize from the television show Lost. Also trails will lead you to a gorgeous secluded beach (Kalewa Bay) where you may find yourselves the only people on the beach. There is also a very nice cove at the resort (Kuilima) with great snorkeling. The onsite restaurants were for the most part very average. Ola's had the best food and drinks, however service can be very hit or miss. We had better luck in Haleiwa at Haleiwa Joe's, Cholo's, and Pizza Bob's. All of the previous postings which refer to the seclusion of the resort are correct. It doesn't take long to explore all of Turtle Bay and if you have an active family you may want to explore other beaches in the area, eat out, and shop. If so, then you absolutely need a rental car. We used Turtle Bay as our base and spent each day at a different beach on the North Shore, ate and shopped in Haleiwa. Lai'e Town is nearby, and has restaurant's and a Foodland Grocery Store as well. Everything is fairly convenient but you need a car to access it all. Now with all this said let me express what a disappointment the actual hotel itself is. We had a Deluxe Oceanfront room and I was hoping for something special. The view from our lanai truly was spectacular, however the room itself fell short. I knew that it was an older property, but heard that it had undergone a major renovation just a few years ago. I don't know where the money was spent, but it sure wasn't in the actual hotel guest rooms themselves. The beds were old and not comfortable. The furniture itself had all seen better days. The rooms are all painted an institutional shade of green with two unattractive pictures of what looks like a science book depiction of bacteria. Old lamps, old carpet and a general look of old and tired. Housekeeping trys very hard to keep things tidy, but it is run-down. There are large glass windows everywhere that offer panoramic views which are marred by the stips of tape over the cracks. The lobby furniture is stained, and all the carpet in the public area has stains. I was very disappointed in the general look and feel of the hotel. The hotel will never be a world class resort due to the inattention to details. I also didn't like the fact that guest parking which is included in the $15 daily resort fee is not guaranteed. You are directed to a general lot that is shared with public access, so many times you will circle the lot or be forced to go pay for valet parking because there is no actual 'guest' parking. It is also some distance from the hotel, so plan on this if carrying heavy items. The hotel also 'includes' in the fee complimentary snorkle gear. Well the fine print limits this to one hour a day for up to two people. Plan to rent elsewhere for your stay, or purchase. Either option is cheaper than the extra $ at Turtle Bay. Also, the tennis courts were closed during our recent stay, so that may be worth inquiring on if you plan to play. The most irritating thing of all is the infamous 'Towel Card'. Each guest must have a towel card in order to obtain a pool or beach towel. Once you return the towel you get the card back. Lost cards are fined $25. This policy is widely derided by the guests and staff alike. The towels used are worth no more than 50 cents each, so your $25 will buy Turtle Bay alot of new towels. It's the little things like this that differentiate quality lodgings, and Turtle Bay's management needs to work on that.

I called reception and they changed us to a room across the way on the same floor (6th). This seemed fine until night fall when the noise started again, and kept me awake. I called for a manager this time and asked for the noise to be investigated, the engineer explained that the extractor fan for the kitchens ran through the walls of both the rooms we had stayed in. This clearly wasn't good enough and I expressed this to the manager so she suggested a smoking suite for us, however on inspecting this room one on the shutters was derailed on the balcony so this wouldn't do either. We finally settled into a great suite on the 6th floor again, we stayed here for nearly two nights. On the second night the bugs in the bed that I had seen the night before reappeared and bit me!

Back to the hotel, it is a very tired, seventies looking building, made from cinder blocks and is totally without any character whatsoever. The rooms are boring, with only two non descript pieces of artwork over the bed. Guys get a clue, some hawaiiana throughout the hotel might help a little! The bathrooms are motel quality, the tile in the shower /tub combo is painted with pastel green epoxy paint, nice touch! I know they have spent a lot of money on the place in the last couple of years, but I can't figure out where it went. The lobby is huge and vacant, the hallways institutional and everywhere is in need of maintenance. Just look around and there is rusted paint and crud everywhere. Check out the huge picture windows outside of the elevators on each floor, fantastic views of both beaches, that is if you could see through them, I don't think they have been washed in years, gross! The Hang Ten pool bar is a prime example. The bar is without any sense that you are in Hawaii. No palm fronds, Koa wood, music etc. All the bartenders and waitresses are mainlanders, not a local among them. As another reviewer pointed out, they even re-use the plastic food baskets without washing them, which by the way they also serve food in at the Bay Club, nice touch guys. If you go to a similar priced resort such as the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island, you get a beautiful open pool bar, with sand to wiggle your feet in, tropical feel etc. with locals with a smile on there face, food on plates, with cloth napkins and silverware. And talking about the pool here, you will have it all to yourself! That's because the water is so cold almost nobody will dip their toes in it. That is except the weekends when the pool is overrun with non paying locals and their kids which the hotel seems to feel is fine. Stupid! The management is really dropping the ball big time at this place. The breakfast buffet is ok, but not of the standards at other hotels I have stayed at, I want some lime with my papaya! Lei Leis is a nice restaurant as is Ola's. What's up with the crappy reggae music at Ola's played by two young guys that have written the same song twenty times, when every night there is a great father and son Hawaiian combo playing to nobody in the lobby! Want a massage outside against the ocean? Sure thing, but everyone and their uncle can see you, no privacy whatsoever, and get this, the massage table is at the windiest part of the property, and you get to have a ugly dead, half cut down coconut palm stump right next to you! I have never seen another hotel with dead palm trees. Replace them dammit! Again, the management is braindead here! If it was'nt for the fantastic 5 star location, which is really what you are paying for, I would rate the hotel 2 stars. On the other hand if you want to see Oahu, I can't think of anywhere else I would stay, Honolulu is a zoo! Improvements needed: Lei greeting would be nice at checkin Hawaiana Artwork throughout, especially in the hallways Heat the pool Maintenance needed everywhere Spice up the landscaping with more color Rebuild the pool bar Put loungers on the lawns around the property so people can get some peace and quiet Hire more locals or at least more friendly mainlanders Replace the management!", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cTurtle Bay Resort was truly \"Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "JDenise", "ReviewID": "UR5022648", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from six nights at Turtle Bay Resort. I was not sure what to expect, as I had read mixed reviews from \"hating it\" to \"loving it\"! We asked friends and acquaintances who had been to Oahu where they suggested we stay, and every answer was \"Turtle Bay\". Our flight arrived late, so we opted for the first nights' stay closer to the airport in Waikiki. I can truthfully say that had we stayed in Waikiki the entire time, I would have had a miserable time, rather than the wonderful time I experienced at Turtle Bay on the North Shore. Our \"ocean view condo\" in Waikiki was smaller than our bedroom at home, and the ocean was blocks away. There was not a lot of \"lushness\" in the skyscrapers, shops and wall to wall people in Waikiki. The beach was crowded, and you could not tell where one hotel started and one hotel ended. It was just a big city and a crowded stretch of beach with no real personality. We left that afternoon for Turtle Bay where we passed through quaint towns and villages, and the further north we got, the more tropical it became. I had read a negative review about all of the signs saying to boycott Turtle Bay due to employee problems, but we passed only one such sign, and we witnessed no evident employee problems during our stay. We pulled into the resort and were greeted by valet help, concierge clerks, bellmen and more! No one seemed unhappy about working there as one review had said. They were all cheerful, helpful, and very pleasant. We arrived at our room which was on the second floor and it did not have as great of a view as I had hoped for. The bellman immediately called the front desk, and they moved us to an upper floor which had a fantastic view of the bay, open ocean, mountains, and pool area....couldn't have been better, with a large balcony to sit out on and relax and take it all in. The room was immaculate, the bathroom was large, and the view was spectacular! There were hiking trails, lush foliage, beautiful beaches, a great snorkeling bay, and just about every amenity you could ask for. The Ola Restaurant on the beach was very good, and after long days of exploring the beaches, and swimming in the pool or the ocean, room service was great to come back to! We travel often and I consider myself \"picky\". I found Turtlle bay to be a relaxing, beautiful resort that I would recommend to all! We saw huge sea tortoises barely off shore on our daily walks, and we enjoyed watching the surfers from our balcony each evening.

The hotel and our room and bathroom were clean and the staff accomodating. We were surprised to have a very small lanai with one chair outside in what was supposed to be one of the better rooms. And although nice, the room was just nice, a clean place to lay your head and beautiful view of the ocean, but (for the price), inside, nothing overly exceptional. The trails at the hotel were fun, provided a glimpse of a mongoose, a monk seal sunning himself on the beach and yes, sea turtles. We had the buffet breakfast at the Palm Terrace which was 19.95 a piece. The food was good but depending on what you are used to paying for breakfast, we thought kind of high. We also had dinner at Lei Lei's and the staff again were very accomodating and the filet mignon came with a very healthy leafy salad and sliced squash with mashed potatoes or rice. Each dinner ran around 35 dollars plus our drinks. We had drinks at the two outside bars and 21 degrees north, mai tais ran $7 and beer ran $5. We chose the place because we wanted a quiet laid back atomsphere, I don't know if it was the Easter holiday or what, but there were many families with children. No problems, but just not what we expected. We had and would advise a rental car because of the location and worth it to see the island and sights.

I would have left after the first day, but since there is nowhere else to stay nearby and my meetings started at 7am every day, we were stuck there. Thank God we had a rental car. We had reserved a Pikake suite and needed 2 beds and were confirmed for that. On arrival, we were told all they had was a suite with a king bed, or they would be happy to charge me $75 more a night to go to a beach cottage as it had 2 beds. I told him to guess again and recheck his rooms, that I should not be charged any more than I was already paying because they did not fulfill the confirmation that they had guaranteed. I had 3 adults and a teen with me, and I was paying too much to have to bring in 2 rollaway beds! When he realized he couldn't cheat me by trying to make me pay more for a cottage, he suddenly found a 2 bed Pikake suite. He still cheated us though as it was a handicapped room with a gross bathroom- very slanted tile floor, only 1 sink, no bathtub. For the price I was paying, I should have had a tub and a shower, and definitely 2 sinks. Th bathroom was VERY worn and dated. They never ran the air conditioning in the hallways to save money. Resort was not grossly dirty, but not sparkling clean either. It is truly showing its age. Spa was just okay and overpriced and small. No ambience. Food was overall good, but quite overpriced, even for Hawaii. Nothing for teens to do there as we were in the middle of nowhere, and even having a rental car, any other activities are nearly a full day trip, which cuts into beach or relaxing by the pool time. Hard to relax outside anyway, due to the extremely small area around the pool for lounge chairs, so of course there were tons of people having to sit on the wet grass (we had soaking rains while there) on towels as there were also not nearly enough lounge chairs for the number of guests. Not to mention constant jackhammers all day long around the pool area replacing a walkway. The Hang Ten bar by the pool was also dirty, and I noticed the waitresses dumping the plastic food baskets that only had paper liners inside the trash cans to empty them, then not cleaning them and reserving these contaminated baskets to new diners who ordered food. All they did was place a new paper liner in them.(Hope the paper was not recycled from ealier diners!) I could go on and on, but it just makes me nauseous. The closest town to the resort, Haleiwa is described as rustic. It is just gross, run down and dirty and so were the restaurants there. The only reason this hotel survives is on conferences and honeymooners and school groups invading the breakfast buffet in the morning. Parking was also a nightmare If this had been my first trip to Hawaii, I would not have known any better, but I am very familiar with all of the islands and this is the worst trip I have ever had there.

We have a mixed review and were fairly disappointed with several aspects of the hotel. First, the Good parts: The setting is spectacular! The views are amazing and there is plenty of access to the beach. Nearly every room must have a great view. We got an Ocean Front Deluxe and got a great rate on Expedia (even when the hotel said it was completely full). The sound of the waves crashing was so loud that we couldn't hear the TV if the door was open. The hiking trails are great and take you to secluded beaches where you can swim, kayak, or sun bathe. The daily resort fee of $15 includes parking, one hour on the tennis courts, an hour of snorkeling, and other extras. The food at the Palm Terrace was very good and inexpensive. The food and service at Ola was exceptional (possibly because it is not affiliated with the hotel). There are also several other great places to eat in Haleiwa. You don't have to spend much money on food, unless you want to. Now, the Bad parts: This hotel is OLD and DATED! Although the room had new paint, carpet, and linens, the bathroom was really old and dark and a little creepy. The room also looked worn and the doors actually had rust showing on them. There isn't much furniture in the room so there are lots of empty spaces. Someone else referred to it as \"the bowling alley,\" we thought it was \"room enough for square dancing.\" The resort itself doesn't look well maintained and the whole place just felt a bit dirty and unkempt. We saw alot of trash all over the property - in the hallways, outside, on the hiking trails, in the common areas - and it remained there day after day after day. The worst part was the fitness center that was just a big joke. It might have been okay for a moderate hotel in a city, but not for a \"luxury resort.\" There wasn't much equipment, it was shoved in a small room, it wasn't clean, and it was very obvious that no one maintained it. There were only two treadmills and one was broken the entire 5 days we were there. The two elliptical trainers squeaked and rattled, but we didn't dare say anything about them or they'd slap an \"Out of Order\" sign on those too. There also wasn't any disinfectant to clean the machines. The bottle was empty. When I asked for them to refill it, I got several nasty glares from the employees who disappeared and never returned. The next day, the bottle was half full - with straight rubbing alcohol! The weight machines were rusty and didn't move well so we didn't bother. The equipment just wasn't safe to use. Now, for the Disgruntled part: I read the reviews from several months ago when making our reservations and saw something about \"labor disputes\" and problems with employees. Since they appeared to be resolved, we decided to stay there. Based on our experience, the disputes are NOT resolved and there is a definite tension here. You can feel it. Although we had very good service at Palm Terrace and at the hut where you rent snorkles, the other employees were not pleasant and definitely did not go out of their way to be pleasant or helpful. They are definitely unhappy and I think you have to ask why. The waitresses at Palm Terrace were wearing red buttons that said \"Unified\" which apparently refers to the labor squabbles. These buttons matched red signs we saw posted on the way there that said \"Boycott Turtle Bay Resort.\" I also saw \"trash\" on the beach that was actually a couple fliers telling people to boycott Turtle Bay. I didn't read all the details, but saw one statement that said they'd only received 70 cents in raises in the last 10 years. The whole situation made us feel a bit unsettled and interfered with our enjoyment of the resort. It was a marked contrast from our stay at the Hapuna Beach Prince Resort on the Big Island in September. At that resort, the employees love their jobs and go out of their way to be pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. Bottom line: We were glad we went to the North Shore. It is beautiful and restful and totally unlike Honolulu and Waikiki.

The main bedroom was the only one with a small AC unit and the loft was uncomfortably warm at night. But it was quiet and peaceful. Not too far from Sunset Beach and other destinations. Our only complaint was upon arrival there was only one clean towel for our party of four. We arrived on a Sunday of a holiday weekend and no one was available on the grounds to assist us and the off-site office was closed. We found our towels wet and in the washer. The floors were grimy and had to be mopped on the first day, the VCR was broken as was the clock in the kitchen and the screen door to the lanai was broken and off the tracks. The showers ran cold on a consistent basis. The porch light was also broken which made it dangerous at night in the rain, not to mention unsettling because the grounds are not well lit. Upon contacting the management (about 20 min up the road) we found them less than helpful and unpologetic when we explained the problem. She grudgingly gave us more laundry detergent (said we were responsible to buy more) to wash the towels but offered no apology and blamed us for not calling the office. Frustrating. Overall, we thorougly enjoyed the convenience of our condo which included kitchen, W/D, sofa, etc. - a quiet, homey place to get away from the hustle of Waikiki and day-tripping. Oahu is absolutely breath-taking. If not for the inept management and maintenence on the condo, I would highly recommend staying on the North Shore if you want a feel of the small community.

As you drive down the Kam Hwy through the middle of the island you pass valleys and view rainbows and homes on the mountain sides. One word: Gorgeous! As you drive you enter miles of pineapple fields. Again beautiful views. You pass the Dole Plantation. I recommend a visit there just for the experience. The maze was fun and the Koi pond is great. After passing the Plantation you come to a fork in the road and you have to turn left to go towards Hale'iwa. As you go into your turn you drive up a hill and as you crest the top pull over there is a spectacular view of the ocean. As you drive past Hale'iwa there is a beach just past the turn off on your left. Park your car on the right side of the hwy. (You will know you are there because there are cows in a field usually.) I recommend time near sunset. My wife and I sat there taking pictures and watching the turtles come to shore. As you leave Hale'iwa you will pass the North Shore beaches and then there is a sharp left turn. To the right of the turn is Waimea Valley and Falls. Recommend two hours spent wondering. The TB it self: As you turn off the road and enter the resort you will notice how beautiful and well the lawn and shrubs are maintained. The lady at the gate just asked my name and said to enjoy our stay. From that point on she always greeted us by our names whenever she saw us. Parking was fine. You have to consider you are on a resort and other people stay there also. The lobby is huge and beautiful with a huge glass wall facing the ocean with comfy couches. The front desk staff was courteous and new our names and greeted us with the Aloha Spirit. The staff was courteous and seemed genuinely happy see to us. We had a deluxe ocean front room. The room was clean and up to date. The lanai was large enough for us to have two chairs and sit and watch the waves. The bathroom was clean and mold free. Our room was always cleaned by 5 PM everyday. Perhaps it was because we tipped the house staff $5.00 a day or maybe not. I called and asked for more towels on our third night there and maid was there in 10 minutes. Again I tipped $5.00. Wow $5.00. Big deal. I recommend drinks at the pool in the evening. The bartender was great. I also recommend you and your loved one go to the beach at night and sit in one of the caba\u00f1a chairs and just sit with each other watching the ocean at night. But be careful walking back to the hotel because of the little sands crabs. My wife is afraid of small crawly things. Shocker it is a beach and there were crabs. We ate every morning at the Palm Terrace. The buffet was included with our room. Service was great. The food was great. Loved the omelets. Again $5.00 or $10.00 tip works wonders sometimes. Think people. We recommend getting a map and doing the tours yourself. Do not take an organized tour unless it is the Shark Dive in Hale'iwa. You will save a bunch of cash. Example: Drive to Pearl Harbor and parking is the only thing you pay. You have a car anyway so use it. Another example when we went to Waimea Valley and Falls the tour would have cost us $60.00. We drove and parked and it cost $18.00. Here is a shocker people prices of everything there, food, gas, restaurants, etc. are the same there as in most of states. We live in Northern Virginia 20 miles from Washington DC and found prices the same or cheaper than here where we live. Restaurants we recommend: Pizza Bob's great deals and great food. The Crouching Lion on the Windward side of the island. The Hanohano Room at the Sheraton Waikiki. Make sure you go at sunset and watch the sun set against Diamond Head. The House Without a Key at the Halekulani lunches were expensive but hey you are on vacation. Take an afternoon or morning and walk Waikiki and people watch. Browse and shop. The main thing is you are in Hawaii. Enjoy it. Experience it. Love it! There is so much to do. The North Shore Shark Dive $120.00-The Valley of The Temple $4.00-The Punch Bowl National Cemetery Free-Waikiki Aquarium $12.00-The Bishop Museum $36.00-Queen Emma's Summer Palace $10.00-Pearl Harbor Free-Finally just drive around and enjoy!

Like most of you out there, after I booked I read many negative reviews over the six months prior to my departure and I became quite worried that I had made a mistake. As it turns out, it was not a mistake at all. Turtle Bay Resort has a fantastic location on the North Shore. We checked in 3 hours early and then went for a walk to familiarize ourselves with the resort, when we returned there was a bottle of chanpagne on ice in our room which was a nice touch. The Room: Our room was an ocean front deluxe. It was big with a large lanai and a big comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was also large. The safe is a great addition to the room and is included in your resort fee. The room comes with a small fridge which is great to hold a few beers, orange juice, etc. The maids do a great job on a daily basis. The Pool Area: I disagree with those who say the large pool is too cold. It is perfect as far as I am concerned...a little warm according to my wife. It is not crowded, but then again we were there in low season. The hang ten pool bar is great with very friendly bartenders. I found the wait staff around the pool to be a little slow, but they were friendly. The smaller pool is warmer and great for a dip in the evening when the slide is closed and the air is a little cooler. The Food: We found the food to be good but a little overpriced. The Palm Terrace was ok and I reccommend ordering off the menu for breakfast instead of the buffet. The food at 21 degrees is quite good but way overpriced. Go there once if you must and sit outside and watch the sunset and the surfers. As many people have mentioned before me, Lei Lei's is where you want to eat the majority of your meals at the resort. Good service, good food, great fish.....and yes, a little overpriced. Activities: For those who say that Turtle Bay does not have enough for you to do, I disagree and suggest you go to Disney World if you feel that is the case. We had no problem filling our five days with different and fun activities. The tennis was free every day for an hour, I golfed, she spent time at the spa, horseback riding, hiking, swimming and sitting on our balcony with a bottle of wine watching the sunsets...we were exhausted after each day. Final comments: I would recommend Turtle Bay to anyone, but especially honeymooners. It is a little quieter than most resorts but that is part of its charm. As far as the service goes, we were quite happy with all the staff. Don't worry, you'll have a great time!", "Date": "September 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cape coral fl", "Title": "\u201cLOVED TURTLEBAY\u201d", "Author": "don_anneCapeCoralFl", "ReviewID": "UR3933777", "Content": "we loved our stay at turtle bay,pools and pool bar are excellent, nice restaurants, lobby view is spectacular with entertainment,the resort is quiet and relaxing-this is truely hawaii at its best-room view was excellent and staff very nice-will recommend this hotel to all we meet", "Date": "September 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, wa", "Title": "\u201cCompletely different side to Oahu\u201d", "Author": "seasue", "ReviewID": "UR3925960", "Content": "We stayed at the condos at Turtle Bay for a week.

We had pizza one night at the Bay Club which had live music and good service. Another night we had the buffet at the Palm Terrace and our teenage son loved it, but we thought it was overpriced for the quality of food. Our best meal was a Lei Lei's at the golf club. Service, food and the setting were fabulous. Haleiwa had some good restaurants as well: we liked Cholo's, Pizza Bob's and Joe's. We also enjoyed shaved ice with ice cream at Matsumotos and Aoki's (didn't see a difference between them). I would highly recommend a visit to the Waimea Audobon Park.

They have a sign on the resort that sayes \"true Hawai'i\" and I would agree. It is not a busy resort, with lots of action and crowded pool or beach. Just come and enjoy weather and views and relax. We found a deal through costco travel for a 5 night vacation with Air and Car. You will need a car in this location. Would be great if you can get a deal that included breakfast each morning, because there are not a lot of options close by and then you don't have to worry about spending the $20+ on the breakfast buffet. We were treated very nicely during our stay and did see any signs of the \"labor\" issues that other reviewers discussed. Only thing was a few of the \"Palm Terrace\" restuarant worker did wear a \"settle now\" button. They seem to be the least pleasant of the employees. We had an OceanFront, small Lanai, room, which had 2 Queen beds. The room was very nice with down covers and pillows. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a dressing room that included a large closet (could store all your luggage away in there), Table with coffee maker, Fridge, Sink and vanity. Then another room with Toilet, Sink and Shower/Tub. The soaps were premimum and had a nice scent. This made it easy for someone to get ready in the morning , while someone else had to use the shower or toilet. The Lanai was very small with room only for 1 Chair. But we rarely spent time in the room and when we did, we had the door open so we all could enjoy the view and sound of the ocean. For several days we could see Turtles in the water right outside our window, but when the surf picked up, then the water became less clear and we could not see the turtles. So yes, turtles do exist there. The pool area was very nice, with a large pool (cool water) (went from 3 to 11 feet). It had a good view of the ocean and the surf. You could watch surfers from the bar or large pool area. Then another smaller pool area that was about 4 feet (warmer water) with a waterfall and a slide that the kids loved. They also had a small hot tub, that could hold about 3 couples. The pool area was never busy and the bar staff does not come around bugging you too much as a matter of fact, they tend to forget about bringing you the bill, but they will call your room and ask you to come and sign for the bill later. We only ate a few places, your choices are limited in this area Hang Ten (good Fish Tacos) Palm Terrace (not that good, only there for breakfast and Lunch a few times. Not a resort quality restuarant) Shrimp stand outside the turtle bay gate (excellent, coconut shrimp and the lemon pepper shrimp). $11 for a good size plate of shrimp, rice, salad. Lei Lei - Good and much better dinner menu than Palm Terrace. Very limited menu for Breakfast (3 items - French toast, fruit plate and Egg sandwich). Limited lunch menu Papa ole's for breakfast - just on the southside of Poly Cultural center in a strip mall. Good quality and value. Cheeseburger in paradise - Cheeseburgers work in this chain. Very busy We were hungery and down on the strip. We did look for a luau and missed the one at the resort. It is only offered on Friday nights. Really did not want to go to Polynesian Cultural Center, because of some of the poor reviews I had read online and was not in givening out a hugh amount of money to a church run estabishment (LDS). Every other Luau was so far away and would require at least 45 minutes of driving. We finally elected to go to the PCC for their twilight Alai Luau. This would be our 4th Luau in the past 10 years. It was very good and the Luau was short and Dinner well run. Now as far as the food goes, it is like every other Luau I have been to and maybe just not as much Poi or raw fish, but they know the average tourist will only just taste these items. Nothing really special about the food, except the staff was on top of things in the buffet line. Nothing was ever empty and the area was kept clean after each set of guests when through the line. They offered the same corney jokes and same \"family\" atmosphere, just without the drinks and sexual humor. The Luau is only about 1.5 hours with Dinner. Then you can go to the evening show, which has more of the performances you are use to an a Luau only with better view. This was a good show of what we saw, we had to leave after intermission.

Haleiwas Joes ( much Better) and at Haleiwas Eats Thai ( the best). Things we did that were well worth it... Shaved Ice at Aokis and Matsumotos and the tour at the macadamian nut farm , this was excellent. It does not look like much, but the tour (12.50 per person) is well worth it. We played golf both at the Palmer course and the Fazio Course. Very wide open on Mon, Tues , Wed and Thurs. If You start early like 7:00 or 7:30am, You can replay either course with plenty of time for $30.00.Palmer course is harder due to the blind pins. Fazio is pretty straight forward. We did take a ride out to Coral Creek and to Ko OLina. Coral Creek personnel was on the rude side. Course looked average. Ko Olina similiar to Kapula or Poipu. Very resort course. Seemed to be a bit more crowded. Dole plantation tour was so so. You can either read the signs for the tour or take the train with a verbal tour. Only if time permits would we recommend this tour. Waikiki is crowded. We went to the Magic show at the Beachcomber. For 44.00/person we thought this was worth it. The Beaches are not as great as Kauai or Maui. We went to Hanaumu Bay. Go early.

We did a little hotel hopping and are so very glad we stayed here. We heard some mixed reviews about this resort..but let me tell you- If you are looking to get away to a place that is romantic, beautiful and relaxing, then this is the place for you. We stayed for four nights in the oceanfront cottages. The room is spacious, with a king sized poster bed, high vaulted ceilings, a soaking bath tub, private lanai, mini-bar with sink,etc...everthing looked fairly new. (the room is exactly like the picture shows on their website) The view was magnificent, a huge grassy yard behind our cottage was filled with hammocks scattered throughout the trees...just an unbelievable ocean view, which you were able to get to just by stepping out your back door. The resort has a nice pool, the water by the beach is pretty much all rocks, so that made it hard to go in the ocean water. (I don't like the ocean water anyway, so I didn't mind) We walked on the rocks, which I think were lava formed....did the horseback riding trail, which was excellent! We saw turtles in the evening poking their heads up for air in the water. As far as the food...it was good, nowhere to really eat besides the hotel and a nearby town. (which we didn't try) The service was excellent! In the cottages you have a personal concierge, ours was Eric, he was awesome...anything we needed, he was a step ahead of us! (so delightful) Everyday we were greeted with complimentary water, fresh squeezed juice of the day, and a fruit of the day.

We reserved a Pikake suite at $495. per night. On arrival, we were given room 431 that looked nothing like the Pikake pictures that the resort has on the web site. The suite was moldy smelling, had dirty carpet, some of the furniture was obviously missing, and the bathroom needed a good cleaning. I complained to the front desk and was told they were sold out, so check back tomorrow to see if another suite was available. I did, and met wonderfully helpful Melissa. She worked for about 30 minutes to find us another suite and came up with room 256---truly the best suite in the resort. It has a huge, fully furnished, direct ocean-front balcony where we enjoyed private dinners and amazing sunrise breakfasts. Each time we saw her, she asked if everything was O.K. and could not do enough to make sure we were comfortable. Even our housekeeper, Violet, bent over backwards to get everything we needed. This was our second stay at the resort. The first time we stayed here, it was a Hilton hotel and none of the employees was as helpful as Melissa or Violet. On our next to last night, we decided to have a final dinner on the balcony which turned into a disaster. The server, Jarel B, arrived with a single tray piled high with some of the food we ordered and the bottle of wine. 1 entry was missing and the dessert was uncovered . I asked what hapened to the table with table cloth, napkins, candle, water, bread service, etc. He looked at me and smugly advised that the order was not big enough to bring a table and all the extras to the room: that type of service was reserved for \"higher dollar\" orders. Now, for all of us room service types, you already know that with a bottle of wine, this dinner was a \"higher dollar\" order. I was speechless yet furious, and simply signed the check. We called the in-room dining manager who sent someone to complete the service. In fairness to the resort, the next morning, we received a call from the Private Dining manager, Allen, who wanted to \"make it up\" to us, but because we were checking out the next day, there was nothing he could do. I imagine that Jarel B is operating as usual. Maybe this is nothing, but that incident put a very bad taste in our mouths. As we left Turtle Bay, we decided not to go back.

An added bonus is that you can park your car right behind the bungalow so that you don't have to worry with valet parking. Service was very good and everone was friendly. The kids had surfing lessons which were provided at the resort. The pool was nice and chairs were readily available. Most of the beach near the hotel was rocky, but you could walk to some very nice, private beaches. My wife and mother-in-law golfed on the Palmer course. They were impressed by the course, but surprised that few of the holes were on the ocean. We ate a few meals at different restaurants at the Turtle Bay. Overall, the food was very good - much better than I had expected based on some of the reviews. Compared to other places where we stayed in Hawaii, I didn't think that the food prices were that bad. (E.g. fish taco at lunch was $10; nice breakfast buffet was $18.) If you plan to eat at both the hotel and in Haleiwa, I would eat at the hotel on the weekend and eat in Haleiwa on weekdays. Haleiwa was very crowded the weekend that we were there. On Tuesday, the traffic was much better and we didn't have to wait for a table at the restaurant. If you reserve a bungalow, you should be aware that some are closer to the ocean than others. Also, there are quite a few of them so you should consider asking for one closer to the hotel. A few miscellaneous points. The hotel had washers and dryers on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Intenet access was free and available to children, an important feature for my 12 and 14 year old kids. The mini-bars were half full so you could stock them with beer, milk, etc. They also have a little convenience store - prices at the store are high but not outlandish.

The resort grounds are utterly amazing! You could stick a Motel 6 on this property and it would be 4 stars worthy. Location: Seemingly a million miles from civilization. The nearest town rolls up the streets by about 9 p.m. This can be a curse or a blessing based on your vacation expectations. This place is for rest & relaxation. Look elsewhere for any type of action or nightlife. Property: As picturesque as any hotel you can find. The surrounding beaches are some of the best and are nearly empty most of the time. Turtles are easy to spot at a variety of areas throughout the resort. The sunset and sunrise views are unsurpassed (actually caught a double rainbow one morning). The pools are good and large enough to accomodate everybody. The bigger pool is absolutely huge and very deep (a little cold, but refreshing). Nice that kids generally stay in the kids pool which is really warm and has a short slide for a little entertainment. The grounds were clean and generally well maintained. The hiking trails are fantastic and not to be missed. Rooms: Nothing to get excited about but far from poor. Rooms are large and easily accomodate a roll-away. A little sparse in furnishings and a little dated in the bathrooms. Water pressure in shower was absolutely pitiful. Nice to have an empty mini-fridge to store some drinks & snacks. Bed was quite comfortable. Carpet and furnishings were in good shape. Lanai was good size with great views. Service: Mostly friendly and responsive throughout our stay. The folks staffing the pool seemed preoccupied most of the time but it didn't really matter much. Food: Lei Lei's was quite good. Their prime rib is really excellent for a golf course restaurant. The place is definitely not a secret and does a brisk business nearly every night. A little expensive, but no more so than any other typical resort restaurant. Room service was better than average and reasonably priced. Keep in mind, that this resort could take you to the cleaners on food bills if they wanted to since the nearest food is a minimum of 20 minutes from the resort and even that is of limited selection. Overall: I felt like I got my money's worth which is not often the case in hotels costing $300/night. This resort must have been unparalleled back in the '70s.

I'd read many of the previous reviews and have to admit I was prepared to keep the suitcases packed and ready to jump to another island if the resort was as bad as some have suggested. I also have to agree with a previous reviewer that some of the other reviews could not have been written about the Turtle Bay Resort we just visited. My wife and I spend a vacation every year on one of the islands, more often than not on Maui at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua or the Four Seasons Wailea. They are both grand resorts with first class amenities. This year we decided to revisit Oahu and Turtle Bay Resort on the North Shore. First the location: Neither the Ritz Carlton nor the Four Seasons have the spectacular grounds, views or number of close, easy to access beaches that Turtle Bay has. A short 1/2 mile walk away from the resort and we were on clean, white sand beaches with not another soul in sight. Sea turtles floated by right at our feet, occasionally bumping into us (so much for not disturbing the turtles) as we waded in the crystal blue water. The waves around the hotel were not as big as we're told they are when the winter storms roll in but we enjoyed watching the surfers ride whatever set happened to catch their fancy. It was 89 every day, sunny with light trade winds. The Resort Staff: Everyone from Ricardo our Bellman, to Malia at the spa, Virginia at the Coffee bar to the front desk, housekeeping, restaurant and pool employees were very polite. The Hotel: Our room was on the 4 th floor, Deluxe Ocean view. It was very clean, large and had a good size balconey perfect for watching the sun set. The furnishings were in good condition and decent quality although the amount of furniture and quality weren't up to Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons standards. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Restaurants: We ate most of our meals on the property, Lei Lei's was as good as advertised with excellent service, the Palm Terrace food was fair but again service very attentive and we liked the buffet breakfast. We ordered room service dinner a couple of times and found the food to be very good. Spa: I had two massages and my wife a facial and Scrub. While the Spa is small compared to many others we've been to you didn't feel rushed as you sometimes do at the big resorts, where you are just another body going for a treatment. I can highly recommend a massage from Malia. Sightseeing: Since we've been to many of the islands, we didn't do much sightseeing. Visited a number of the local towns and beaches and went to the nature center. The nice thing about the North Shore is you feel as though you're experiencing old Hawaii. Golf: We played 3 rounds of golf. Two on the Fazio course and one round on the Palmer course. Both are entertaining but the Palmer course was alittle more challenging and in better shape. The pro shop staff was polite and while our golf was fair the rounds were fun. Summary: If you are looking for a mega size resort with malls and shopping go to the other side of the island or to another island. If you want to enjoy some of the most beautiful, unspoiled scenery, white sandy beaches at a clean, comfortable resort try Turtle Bay.

We loved this place. Of all the hotels on all of the major Hawaiian islands that we've stayed at, this was my absolute favorite. First, the location of this resort is unbeatable. The views from our balcony were exceptional. Theres'a beach on each side of the hotel, one perfect for swimming and snorkeling in, and the other primarily for surfing and turtle-watching. Both were relatively uncrowded, but by walking along the beach for less than 10 minutes on either beach, you'd have the whole area to yourself. Standing on the lanai (balcony) we had the most spectacular sites, and the floral scents that the winds brought each day were better than anything out of a perfume bottle. The resort itself was very well landscaped. Beautiful palm trees everywhere. Low key luxury seemed to be the theme. Nothing to take away from the natural beauty. Some well placed hammocks and additional plumeria trees would have been a welcome addition, but other than that, it was perfect. We read a lot of reviews that were critical of this resort, in particular the unfriendly staff. Overall we've stayed at places in Hawaii that had friendlier staffs, they had the aloha spirit where it was most appreciated, in the pool area. The pool staff consisted of very friendly young women and men who all seemed to enjoy their jobs and were great with kids. Most of the time the servers from the Hang Ten Bar were very prompt, and we rarely had to wait for very long, even in the kid pool furthest from the bar. The musicians and performers that appeared nightly were very gracious and interactive. My daughter's favorite part of the resort was of course the pool. They had a terrific keiki (kid) pool area, with a slide and very warm water. We had a tough time dragging her away each night. There were also two jacuzzis, one in the general area, and one tucked away in some bushes that was probably ideal for honeymooners. Our one complaint here would be the food. The primary restaurant, the Palm Terrace, served bland food and the buffet was selection was very boring. Strangely, though, we found when we ordered from room service, the food was much more flavorful. One money saving hint for families - the Keiki menu offered a nice selection, the portions wer HUGE, and most were around $6. We ended up splitting two items from the kids menu (the chicken pieces were yummy) and dessert, and spent about $30 for dinner each night, a tremendous value for this area. We heard people raving about the upscale restaurant and Lei Leis which was on the golf course, but never made it there. For anyone looking for the perfect place for families, this is THE place to go. There were lots of honeymooners there too, as the sunsets at the bar were very romantic, and the proximity to deserted beaches would be a nice draw for this set, so it's a great resort all around.

The rooms were beautiful and the maid service was the best ever!!!! Also the coffee cart lady was THE BEST EVER. She had been at the hotel for 20ish years! She loves working for these people so don't even try to say anything bad about the hotel. I loved her! The grounds are beautiful. I just wished for a bathroom off the trails somewhere, its a long walk back. There are two laundry machines on each floor. I think it was $1 each and $1 for detergent. Don't believe anyone about the hotel staff. The people of Hawaii are the nicest of any place I've been. (side note...the redhead waitress at the bar is not a hawaiian person, she must have been paid extra by one of the Wakiki hotels to be rude to Turtle Bay vacationers). Speaking of Waikiki. Why anyone would want to stay in that dirty town is ....... Might as well stay home then stay there.

I think the people who posted negatively on here are just big complainers!! How can you complain about a heavenly vacation like this! Ugh, people are just negative. We kept the door open the entire time, and spent many happy content hours just staring at the waves and best of all, listening to them crash against the shore. It was spectacular. We stayed on the side opposite Kuilima Cove, just over the lobby and I understand that is the better side to stay on because the other side has construction... Our side also had a longer expanse of ocean and views of the cottages too. The pool is right below that side, so if you think that traffic will bother you, think about the Kuilima Cove side. We however really liked being able to people watch if we wanted, and then for the majority of the time look over and past the pool and bar, out into the horizon. You just get hypnotized as the waves crash against the shore! Anyway, it is a beautiful place and worth every penny. It actually wasn't super expensive, ( I thnk we paid around 250/night through Costco) I considered that a great deal!! I was so surprised how nice this place actually was. Casual and unpretentious, but still elegant. It was clean and modern. Our room was great, with a fridge and a very comfy bed.. Bathroom was great.. Yes it's true there are a lot of kids around, to be fair--- if that is a problem for you, just know it in advance. But Hawaii is one of those places people take the kids. It just is! The fact that families are there enjoying a vacation together shouldn't get in the way of your own personal ability to have a great time. I just don't really understand that. We don't have children and didn't especially sit around thinking, gee let's go to a resort that has a lot of kids staying there, but the fact that there were kids around didn't get in our way at all. Again, I think people are just complainers. But anyway. We ate in the fancy restaurant one night (21 degrees) and it was great. My husband requested a table with a view as it was my 30th bday. When we arrived they had a booth right next to the window for us. The waitress wished me a happy birthday right away, they had made a note of it. And she brought me a delicious souflee as a surprise, on the house. The food was EXCELLENT. We can be food snobs and we were not disappointed. It was expensive but not overpriced. We would have eaten there every night if we could have afforded to. We also ate at Lei Leis and the food was awesome. Highly recommend it. I snorkeled in Kuilima Cove daily despite the fact that it was windy and rainy. I saw plenty of fish and I was usually the only person in the water! It was a great place to snorkel. We loved going for walks around the property. And my husband isn't particularly a \"Let's go for a walk\" kind of guy, let me say. But he was saying that when we were there! There is so much to explore. The Hang Ten bar is the best place ever to sit and sip a Mai Tai-- They make a great Mai Tai and they don't skimp on it either. After one you definitely feel it! The sun is setting, people are surfing, it is quiet, beautiful and the Aloha spirit abounds. The staff were so real, not overly kiss ---- just nice and pleasant and helpful in a genuine way.

Turtle Bay is your best choice on the North Shore. Although it won't compare with some of the most exceptional resorts across the islands, it offers many pleasures on the North Shore, and will certainly be popular with golfers. First, know that the North Shore is a little wilder, more surf-town than busy Waikiki or polished Maui. During the winter, the waves will be rough, water colder than you might be looking for, and wind fairly constant. If you will love surfing, or watching the surfers at Sunset or Pipleline, it's great. Riding, hiking, and some swimming depending on weather is also good. But you might be looking for another kind of Hawaii for your vacation. Turtle Bay resort sits on a stunning promontory with two coves, one on either side. As a building, it is not visually compelling, but pretty much every room will have a view of the ocean. Watching the waves and the sunsets from your room may be the most wonderful aspect of the place -- perfect for relaxation. The rooms are simple and soothing; restaurants are adequate, but not fabulous, and priced like all resort restaurants. (The North Shore is more the place for eating roadside shrimp or packing a lunch for the beach.) Like other reviewers, I recommend room service on your balcony or LeiLei's at the golf course if you eat onsite. There are two pools, one heated; two hot tubs seating about 8 each; and good snorkeling in one of the coves when the weather is good. Note that summer on the North Shore brings very calm water, so plan when you travel based on your preferences.

I'll call you @ noon with the time. I had to call her, needless to say no Thanksgiving Dinner there. If I wouldn't have met Brenda @ the beach snack bar, who got my family in to Lei lei's , we would have had no Thanksgiving and no one cared. Yes my room had mold in the closet as well .

The property has a spectacular location, albeit in winter time, a windy spit of land. We found the rooms very pleasant, beds comfy and views spectacular. We had to change rooms however after a malfunctioning air conditioner unit made the first night unbearable. After it was \"fixed\", we moved up one class of rooms the second night as it went on and off all night long. The large pool is sadly not heated so you have many people lounging poolside, but over the 6 nights we stayed, I saw two children get in it for about 5 minutes. Otherwise, no one used it. The smaller pool is comfortably heated but not configured for those who want to swim laps or use the pool for exercise. The worst knock is the food. While the Hang 10 was good for outdoor light eats, the hotel's other restuarants were WAY expensive for the quality. The food at dinner at the Palm Terrace was no less than horrible, the service, abysmal (and this on a slow night) and though I'm sure it was just our bad luck, a dead fly in the wine glass did nothing to warm our hearts. When management only credited back the glass of wine and threw in a free desert, we knew we were done. The sports bar is apparently only open on weekends which is a big faux pas as there is nowhere else casual to eat in the resort. Plus no place open for breakfast without spending a load on an overpriced buffet. Lei Lei's was also shut for renovations the day we tried to eat there, though it seemed to be open later in our stay. It is also not in the main complex but near the golf course. We checked out a day early after the surf competition we came to see was scratched for a second day, and returned to the warmer envirorns of Waikiki. My husband golfed both courses. The Palmer was a good challenge. Tough and fun. The Fazio is much easier, wider fairways etc but they had sanded the greens which is not much fun. Haleiwa had some great spots for eats, mainly the Heleiwa Cafe, Breakers and the Coffee Gallery. We just got used to making the 12 mile drive for meals. All in all, I expected more from such a pricey resort.

We usually stay at the Kahala Mandarin but wanted to try something new this time. It's not a five-star hotel by any means---but once I focused on the positives, the charms of TBR slowly grew on me. First, the positives---even though we had an \"oceanfront room\" (vs. the more expensive \"deluxe\" ocean front)---the view was simply amazing--you could look out of the hotel room and onto the ocean with a view stretching to forever. The oceanfront rooms had a balcony for only one chair (vs. deluxe where you get 2 chairs and a table). To get a room with such a view anywhere would have cost 4 times as much! The rooms were very clean. The bathtub was small and leaked, with low shower pressure. But, it did have cool amenities (the shampoos/conditioners/soaps are made in hawaii with hawaiian ingredients!) No mini-bar, which was ok with me, since I usually don't use and are overpriced anyway, but the hotel provides a mini-fridge in the room, which is great because there's a Foodland about 15 minutes from the hotel, and we stocked up on fruit juices, milk, beer and bottled water. Also, there are washer/dryers on the premises---a necessity when traveling with messy toddlers on a long vacation. The pool area was fun--try to go on a weekday when it's not crowded---when it's crowded as it was on Saturday and Sunday, it's not as much fun because all the chairs are practically touching and it's uncomfortable to sit so close to strangers and hear their mundane conversations. The large pool was chilled (?)(according to the manager when we complained) and it was to the point of being uncomfortably cold. My husband couldn't swim in it---it was that cold. So, most of the swimmers converged on the smaller heated pool and it was too crowded to do any swimming, while the larger pool even on the crowded days had only 3 or 4 swimmers at the most. The jacuzzi was also crowded and the water was tepid and on the weekdays, when there was less of a crowd, wasn't heated at all. The ocean was swimmable but it was rocky with sharp coral---and the sand was littered---I think they should spend some money to have staff groom the sand every now and then. Unlike some of the other hotels, there is definitely friction btw. the management and the staff---and it shows by the attitude of the staff. They all seem unhappy. They are polite and cordial but unhappy. The staff would even vent out to me about it (how mgmt are subcontracting employees and how the staff has to pay for meals when practically good food from buffet have to be thrown out, etc.)(it's not an aloha spirit at all when the staff is being mistreated and as a guest I feel badly about it. Foodwise---very limited. The poolside had the typical cheeseburger/french fries/greasy selection. We had breakfast vouchers for the buffet every morning which saved $18.95/pp (ask for it if you are booking through costco's)---and there was so much food (fresh fruits, made to order omelettes, etc) that it got us through pretty much most of the day).

We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 4 days and then we were really excited to head up to the North Shore for 4 days and stay at TBR for some quiet relaxation. Instead - we should have just gone home... Turns out, there was a Miss Hawaiian Tropic Beauty pageant going on at TBR the exact days we were there. This would have been nice to have known about. Upon our arrival (and that of the 200 others who were there as either participants in the pageant, family members, or photographers), we were greeted everywhere by signs promoting the pageant, flyers posted all around with their daily schedule on it... Overun... it basically felt like an MTV beach party meets college dorm... not something I would have paid what I paid to be there for. We should have left the hotel and gone somewhere else, but I kept thinking it had to get better, a hotel like this wouldn't let this event interfere with the stay of their guests. Little did I know there were only a few other people NOT there for the pageant... I started out with an open mind and kept giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt, it is a beautiful location, but this event and what it resulted in is more to the liking of a cheaper hotel chain... absolutely terrible. And the few guests, like ourselves, that were there vacationing, were not treated in accordance with the prices we paid and the ordeals we suffered. The pools were overrun every day by around 1:00 with 50 models doing photoshoots. Music and loudspeakers and never knowing what to expect at any moment. It was all in very poor taste. Dinner in the restaurant was a zoo every night since the groups just took up huge tables and walked around mingling at all of them. Made it quite noisy. It was a very negative experience and after talking with management, we realized how ineffective this hotel is and the reason for its lower rating. It is not at the level it prices itself at. But as the only hotel on the North Shore they get away with it. North Shore wasn't as spectacular as that. We should have left - but for sure we will never return to this hotel again. The price wasn't worth it for the service and staff, and the prices should have reflected the event because certainly, the folks there for the pageant didn't pay the same rates and yet the hotel bent over backwards to protect the 'event'. Very disappointed in this hotel, even if the pageant hadn't been going on, the hotel is less than spectacular. The views are great, but you can get the same thing for the same price on Maui and it's much more relaxing and the service on Maui has always been terrific everywhere we've gone. The rooms were not cozy, although the bed was comfortable there was no sitting chair or couch and there was plenty of room for it. The decorating is done in a rather cold manner and overall could use some updating. We ate in the really nice restaurant, Lei Lei's. It was really pricey, and not very full. The food was good and frankly it was worth the money to get away from the pageant people. This hotel could be first rate, it's the only one up on the North Shore and has the structure and location to be a first class operation. But it doesn't have the leadership to effectively carry that out.

Good drinks to. --I could watch the waves all day long, from my room or somewhere else on the grounds. --Leis Leis was a good selection for dinner (about the only choice-see below). It was raining that night and they had a covered golf cart running people back and forth. --One on One surf lessons are truly worth it! Lots of fun and an experience you need to have on the North Shore. I had Drew, nice guy who helped me out when I got tired! You never realize how much paddling is involved. --Staff is very friendly. Negatives: --The beach bar (Sand Bar) is horrible. My wife and I had lunch there while lying on the beach. We both got sick from the chicken wraps. They were disgusting! Beach and beach bar are also being overshadowed by a large resort construction project. Not easy to relax with the sound of power tools and with construction workers staring at you and your wife while you eat and relax. --The beach area in general stinks. The sand is porous and the atmosphere is not that of a beach. Waikiki and the Big Island had much better beaches and were a lot more fun. --You pay a lot of money for what you get, and then they close \u00bd the resort b/c it is \u00bd full. The Palm Terrace was never open for dinner while we were there. The Sports Bar always had a \u201climited menu.\u201d Hang Ten closed early. 21 Degrees North wasn\u2019t what we were looking for, as this was the end of our 2 week honeymoon and we had eaten at plenty of 5 star restaurants. We just wanted a casual meal. We were forced to drive into town each night. --Filming of the \u2018North Shore\u2019 television series can get in the way, especially in the pool area. Again, you pay a lot not to get pushed around by some producer\u2019s schedule. It wasn\u2019t too bad when we were there, but I can see how it could be. --Resort fee is stupid. We stayed at 5 different places while on our honeymoon. Most were nicer than TBR, all were less expensive. No other place had a resort fee. Unnecessary and I consider it gouging. --Room was in need of some spackling and fresh paint, especially around the air duct. The view from outside the room is awesome. Again, you pay a lot of money and expect the inside of the room to look better than an older Holiday Inn. All in all, the North Shore is a must do while on Oahu.

Truly, we wish we had stayed at Kona Village the entire time as Turtle Bay did not meet our expectations. We stayed in Cottage 100; the one closest to the main resort complex. It was beautiful. While the hotel is generally rated as a 3 star, the cottage seemed much more in line with other 4 star accomodations in which we have stayed. The bathroom was huge and beautiful, and the room, with its vaulted ceilings, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and excellent location directly on the beach was spectacular. Sadly, that's where the good part ended. I'll give a brief day by day replay of our experience so you can understand what I mean. None of our problems were that huge, but the total impact of them has left us unwilling to stay there again... Day 1- We arrived at about 4 pm. Check-in went quickly. We were told, however, that the bellmen did not deliver luggage to the cottages. Not particularly a huge deal, we didn't think, until we had to spent about 15 minutes looking for a place to park and ended up lugging our stuff about 1/3 of a mile to reach the cottage. The surf was up you see, and on the north shore, that means surfers. So many of them that even the fire lanes of the parking lot had cars parked in them. The parking lot for the cottages even had cars blocking one of the two entrances. Trust that I have no grudge against the locals' use of the beach there, but the hotel should certainly reserve SOME space for the guests and enforce it. That night we were completely over it, had a pleasant meal at Lei Lei's and were looking forward to our stay. The next morning I was awoken at 5:30 by voices outside our room. Turned out there was a surfing competition planned for that day and the registration tents and PA system apparently had to be less that 30 feet from our door. I don't want to complain too much about this, as it was interesting to watch the competition, and I had a few interesting conversations with the competitors' moms. I imagine some people would have been furious, though. The hotel would have done well, I think, to have given us some type of a heads up. The rest of the day went well, and I really didn't mind sharing the pools and spas with the competitors and their families. The next day, we explored the island, so no complaints until we returned to the hotel for dinner. As cottage guests, we had been invited to a 4 pm tea in the lobby. So, we cleaned up for dinner and headed for the main part of the hotel to attend. When we got there, there was an employee with a little cart of liquor and various wines. We told her we had come for the tea. She then explained that they had decided to stop the tea receptions that very day. So, we asked if we could have a complimentary glass of wine instead.- No. Ok, could we charge a glass of wine to the room?- No, it was cash only. Please! A little frustrated, we headed over to the Palm Terrace for the Buffet we had read about in our in-room folder. We were told that the hotel was only at about 50% occupancy so they would not be having the buffet, and that we'd have to order off of a limited menu instead. We were hungry so we stayed. The meal was so, so. The service was very good, though. Day 3- The next day was extremely rainy. After breakfast at Lei Lei's, we managed to sneak a hike in before the deluge hit. Being on the North Shore in the rain is no fun at all as there is absolutely nothing else around to do that is indoors. So, we gave the kids money for the arcade at the hotel before eating lunch at the Hang Ten Bar (which had glass walls for protection against the wind and rain). Sadly, we had to endure the staff complaining about management; a regular occurence there. Heck, by that time I had a few complaints of my own! We returned to the cottage and paid for a couple of in-room movies to keep the kids and ourselves occupied. Then, around 4 or 5, it dawned on us the the World Series was going on and we could watch the game and grab a bite at the hotel's sports bar, The Bay Club. Thus began a series of small diasappointments which ultimately left us VERY ready to move on to the big island the next day. We got to the Sports Bar, had a drink and enjoyed the game for about an hour. Then, when we asked for a menu, we were told that they were not serving food that evening due to the occupancy rate of only 50%. Pretty dumb considering the rain had stranded so many of us and, duh, the World Series was on! We were pretty hungry, so we proceeded to the Palm Terrace hoping for the buffet but figuring we'd get the limited menu again. NOT! We were told that due to the hotel's occupancy, the Palm Terrace was CLOSED entirely, leaving only the expensive 21 Degrees North open. That's when we began to get pretty frustrated. The kids did not want a fancy, expensive dinner and neither did we. We decided to run across the parking lot to Lei Lei's. We arrived, soaking wet as the hotel had no umbrellas for us to borrow, only to discover that we would have to wait for a long time to be seated. (Duh, again. The hotel had closed all but the most expensive restaurant! Lei Lei's is independently owned which is why it was open, I imagine.) By that time, we were so hungry that we decided to go back to the room and order room service instead. Running back to the cottage, we all decided that a simple pizza, as was listed on the room service menu, would suit us just fine. Can you guess what happened next? That's right! They weren't serving pizza that night due to the occupancy rate. In the end, we were forced to go off property, in the rain, for a meal! Ridiculous. To sum up: The accomodations were great. The management is pretty darn unsavvy, though. It shows in the attitudes of the employees and in the experiences of guests like us. In the end, 50% occupancy or not, we were paying full price for our cottage room- over $400.00 per night. If they are going to slash the the availability of food, they should have also slashed the price of the room. Won't ever go back unless I hear that the management has changed.", "Date": "November 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Beautiful Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2800565", "Content": "The staff was wonderful, very nice, helpful and friendly.

We also had fantastic food at Haleiwa's Joe's - lots of local things and a great deal of variety with nice salads, appetizers and smaller items, although wonderful large dinners too if that's what you want.

We had just come from Maui where we stayed at the Sheraton and were thrilled so we weren't horribly sad to leave Maui as we knew we were headed to Turtle Bay, but we ended up being disappointed. Our room was oceanfront as promised but was over a ugly roof and the balcony was zilch.....you could stand out there but it had no room for a chair. The room itself seemed to be missing furnishings. By the balcony door there is usually a chair to sit in but there was just a big space with nothing and the walls seemed blank with just one picture. I thought I was just being girly about it but even my husband mentioned it so I knew something wasn't right. Also the room seemed dark. Weird. Anyhow- other than that, I know the property was just fixed up and it is....the rooms are clean, the hotel itself and the restaurants are all nice. The pool is OK. The whole property is just missing that extra \"wow\" we thought we would get for the $$ we were paying each night. This place is a place to stay for people that just want to stay put on a property. For others like us that like to leave and explore, get ready to see not much....well, other than great surf. If you are a surf freak like my husband you will be fine, if you aren't you will get bored with the outside surroundings of the property. We left alot and went to the only near town South of Turtle Bay for dinner and one day while exploring in another direction we accidentally ran across where \"Lost\" is being filmed on the beach.

This place is great and what a perfect location. The North Shore of Oahu is true Hawaii. In planing the trip we did a lot of reading and research and decided that Waikiki was probably not for us. If tropical New York City is what you want then by all means stay in Waikiki but if you like peace, solitude and beautiful surroundings then go to Turtle Bay Resort and the North Shore. The resort staff all went out of their way to help make the stay wonderful and everyone we encountered was friendly and cheerful. In planning the trip we were torn between spending the extra money for one of the cottages or to just go with a room with the large lanai. After having been there I can say we made the right choice by not getting the cottage. The cottages are not individual cottages but actually quad-plexes. Being that they are all single story and ground level the view is much more limited. We had room 626 which is on the west side of the south wing and the view was incredible but all the rooms have good views. All the extras at the resort are expensive but the kids program was reasonable at $55 and they got a meal, a visor, a tee shirt and a very nice turtle backpack. The only meal we ate at the resort was the evening barbecue (grilled items) at the Sandbar on the beach. The food was very good and the atmosphere being right there on the beach was wonderful. The meal was reasonable at $18 which included appetizer, main course with rice and dessert. Our other meals were at locals hangouts on the North Shore which saved us big bucks and we had some very good meals. Be aware that staying on the North Shore requires a lot of driving to get around and see the island so if you're accustomed to having everything within 5 minutes of the house you might not be happy here.

There was free poolside entertainment every night, the lobby is magnificently decorated. I can't say enough about the courteous staff at the desk, and at poolside, where fresh towels were provided at a moment's notice. Yes, there were some local people in the jacuzzi and pool, but they were very friendly. Oh, also, the food/chefs were phenomenal, providing great variety, and fresh food nightly. Perhaps some people might not like locals, and require a mint on their pillow, or help within one second of their request, and perhaps I am more laid back than some of the reviewers, but I found everyone to be happy, courteous, and friendly.

The beach was nice and water was ok, lots of coral and rocks. The rooms were very nice and the restaurants were great. The one complaint I would have is that they claim EVERY room (and I quote) has \"picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean\"....not exactly true. We had a Delux Ocean FRONT room, but when we got to our room, the view was pointing back towards the mountains and overlooking the bay infront of the cottages, you couldn't even see the open ocean or the sunset for that matter (we were assured on checkin that it was a sunset room). We tried to switch rooms and no one went out of their way to help...we waited in our room for calls back from managers and the front desk that never came. We were completely ignored when it came to having a problem, we were extrememly frustrated, especially having been assured on checkin that this was a perfect room with full ocean view and sunset view. Finally the next day a new manager was more than happy to help and got us a better room. The funny thing about this resort is that all the Delux rooms face the pool area and the mountains, and all the Premium rooms (with a smaller lanai) face the ocean and have much better views.

They took over the pool area during the day so chairs and room to play were scarce, and they completely filled the two hottubs every night despite signs all over the place that said \"hotel guests only\". Once, a staff member came by and asked if we were all guests and what room number we were in, but the nonguests just made up room numbers and snickered after the guy left. It was annoying to come all the way to Hawaii and spend a fair amount of money to not be able to use the pool and hottubs at the resort. Some of the staff were genuinely friendly (chefs and front desk people), most were \"forced\" friendly and some were just plain rude. For example, there is a desk at the pool area where you can acquire towels for the beach/pool. When I asked for a towel around 8:30am, the two women at the desk gave me a dirty look and curtly told me that they were in the wash, then they \"dismissed\" me and rolled their eyes at each other.

So we waited another 10 minutes while they fumbled around with the phones. They did not offer us another drink coupon ( they should have). They finally gave us our keys and we were off. We had to walk thru the parking lot to get there, no transportation offered. At least they delivered our luggage. When we got there, the cottage was still being cleaned! Had to wait on the grass for another 10 minutes. But once we got in the room, everything got better. The cottage was very clean and spacious. In fact I would say it was great. nice beds and decor. We had a butler (more like a on-call conceirge), He was very cool and not pushy. Service was definitely much better now and would continue to be. We had cottage #111. very close to the water, nice patio. We had the last cottage in the building, so we only had 1 neighbor. There was a grass and plant area to our other side. very private except for one thing. There was some foot traffic between our patio and the bushes in front of the water. Instead of walking on the beach, they would walk infront of our patio. not alot of traffic, but enough to mention. We ate at the restuarant by the club house. It was good and reasonable. The grounds are nice. The pool is nice and deep. A rarity these days. Although, the deck area is small and was crowded. The drinks at the bar are reasonable as well. The bay is very nice and the water was clear. We saw lots of turtles. The beach is not so good. In fact, we would leave the resort to go to the better beaches just west of Turtle Bay. The parking area is bad. It is a free for all. They should have assigned parking near the cottages. I believe this is the only resort in the North Shore area so you don't have alot of choices.

This is great, however the bandwidth got a little bogged down around 5pm, so FYI - A couple of great servers by the pool, especially Taryn & Lisa, very friendly, good Customer Service, Also the bellmen were very helpful. - Pool Convenience Store: Prices were low like ABC stores, which suprised me as you are basically isolated at the resort, so this was a nice suprise and snacks & drinks & beach gear were reasonable. - Close to all the North Shore Beaches if you want some variety. - \"Hang 10 Surf Bar\" by the pool is a great place to relax and watch the sunset. Also, on Wed & Fri's at sunset there is a 15 min luau type show from the Polynesian Cultral Center, so it's good if you don't have time to catch an luau.

Also, b/c the larger pool is closed so is the \"Hang 10\" Surf Bar :( If you are a pool person & would use the main pool area between now and the 17th this may be a big deal for you. - Customer Service Level really varied from staff member to staff member. Front Desk staff overall were very complacent, so don't assume anything and ask if you are unsure on anything. - Restaurants: A little $$-$$$ and the food was ok.

It was big and spacious compared to other hotels that I have stayed at with a large bathroom and closet area. We loved leaving our window open at night and listening to the waves breaking. Clean and spacious. The only problem we had was we had no safe in our room. We brought it up with Guest Relations and they said that we could switch if we wanted to. We decided not too and in the end they waved the $12/day resort fee! Everyone there is super nice and accomodating. Always a smile on everyone's face. We didn't eat at the resort too much. We had complimentary breakfast buffet vouchers to the Palm Terrace every morning since we booked through Expedia and it was so nice.

In Halewia you have to eat at Cholo's Mexican Restaurant in the North Shore Marketplace. We loved it so much, we ate there twice! Also try Jameson's and Halewia Joe's for dinner and to watch the sunset. I loved being at Turtle Bay because you were so far away from the hubbub of the city life.

There are three pools at the resort. A large pool, a kid's pool and a medium sized pool with a super fun water slide that even the adults were trying! There are also 2 jacuzzi's. Everywhere you look while at the pool area, you can see the beautiful surf and landscape. If I know of anyone that is traveling to Oahu, I would only recommend staying here.

There is a lot of walking because the property is so big, but we don't mind that. However, you can always call for a golf cart ride form the beach cottages (Ithink we did that twice). Highlights: Turtles feeding every evening infront of our cottage. They are at the waters' edge about 25 feet from our patio door. Hiking was great. The beach was good, and we loved the pools- we thought there was a good separation for adults w/o lids-there is a separate pool and Jacuzzi away from the kids pool. Pool slide was great, and pool temp was perfect! Our beach cottage was beautiful. Houekeeping weas great, tropical fruit each day, and macaroons wrapped in tea leaves each night. Food at the resort was O.K. I did not think it was any more expensive than most resorts. Breakfast was excellent, and included in our room deal which made it even better. We ate at 21 Degrees one night while our kids were at KeiKei camp- the food was pretty good- apps and salads-excellent, the fish dishes we ordered had a little too much going on. Too many flavors, not really fused together. However, the hawaiian ceaser and lobster bisque were excellent! LeiLeis was good- the food was very good, it is a bit noisy, but OK with the kids. We found our best eats in Haleiwa (pronounced ha-LI-va). Haliewa Joes is great! Sunset Pizza on the road just outside the resort is amazing!

Giovannis Shrimp truck has phenonmenal shrimp scampi-don't be put off by the \"truck\" style ktchen and picnic tables- it was a wonderful dining experience!

Also, the buffet was a bit of a \"cattle-call\"- I would eat at their stands around the park, or get the menu dinner, although I don;t know if it was any better. The guided tour was O.K. You may be better off getting there when they open at 12:00, and taking yourselves around- you would probably see more, and get to do more of the hands-on things- our guide steered us mostly to the dance demos- which you get plenty of at the evening show.

The resort has beach cottages that are a short walk to the main resort amenities like the pool and restaurants (when the walking bridge is finished it will be even better). Even with two kids, we had more than enough room with a huge space with 2 fluffy queen beds and wood floors and hot towels when you checked in.

You do see some \"Boycott Turtle Bay\" signs in front yards along the highway near the resort though.

Huge grounds to walk, plenty of things to do - snorkel, horse back ride, golf, hike - it's just a georgeous place to stay. Well worth the drive from overcrowded, overrated Waikiki. CONS: Pool hours are far too short. The pool/jacuzzi closes at 7:00 so forget sitting in the jacuzzi at sunset. When it is open, it's filled with screaming kids most of the time, so forget about swimming any laps too. Don't get me wrong, I like children but it would have been nice to have some \"adult only\" hours (like 8 to 10 PM) so you could go relax in the jacuzzi without someone doing a running, screaming cannonball 5 feet from you, or wailing that their brother won't stop splashing them, etc. NOTE: Rooms come with two different lanais. The deluxe has a lanai the width of your room with two chairs with a wide ocean view; the next step down is a smaller lanai with one chair that overlooks the ocean and public beach/snorkeling bay. You can save yourself some money and go for the smaller lanai if you don't plan on spending hours out there. It's more than comfortable to sit and read, but for laying out you'd be more comfortable on the beach.

In response to some of the neg. posts, not sure why some would let a lil construction disrupt their vacation experience, but the closed pathways that the other poster described only meant you had to step a few feet away onto their lush lawns to get around in some areas. To be honest, the hotel, the coastal scenery, the pools and the beach were so beautiful we didn't notice the construction going on. As for the resort fee, well how hard is it to pretend that the room was $212 instead of $199, etc. Every other hotel charges the extra $10 for parking and time to use services like internet, etc. anyway, so it's a wash. The rooms were spotless, modern new decor and the beds were the most comfortable we slept in on the trip. Some of the lanais are very small but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. For food options, 2 adults and 2 kids spent one day at the pool, had a lunch from the poolside bar and grill, including a few Pina Colodas and Mai Tais (which were really good), along with some beers, the tab was $80, not bad considering all the cocktails. Because the Resort's restaurants were expensive, the rest of the time we went to nearby Haleiwa for dinners and bought our own breakfast and soft drinks at the nearby grocery store (10mins away) and kept it in the mini-fridge.

Pool: The smaller heated pool is filled with kids, and has but a few places to sit. The larger pool (relative term) is unheated, and just a concrete patio. Beware the pool nazi's. Many Hawaiian resorts ensure you are a guest in order to obtain pool towels. This place also makes sure you return them. Apparently we were off by 1 towel during the stay, and they charged us for it.

Also-if you need to leave early (our flight was at 6:00 am and the airport is an hour away)-bring your own alarm clock as the room alarm clock was broken, we requested a wake up call and never got it. When we woke in a panic-we could not get a bell hop to answer the phone to help obring bags down, and the end of our story was crawling over the front desk in the empty loby to go wake the night desk clerk up-he was sound asleep-and could NOT stay awake to check us out. We still dont have a final bill-this was upsetting to say the least. Nice location-the turtles are really there-beside Anna and Annie and the lovel woman that serves at the coffee kiosk (these three staff members were execellent, world class) the service otherwise is terrible!

We had no problems with check in, check out, bell or valet service. Rates are high however, but its worth every penny.

You will have to drive out and search for other things to do if you arent the stay-in-the-room type. Hollywood celebrities such as Adam Sandler, Jennifer and Brad, Bruce Willis, and Ricky Schroeder are all frequent guests. There are 2 pools; one is heated and contains a very fun slide for kids.

I had a very reasonable Costco package that gave me $205/night for 7 nights, with the 5th night free and complementary breakfast buffet (way worthy breakfast food). The rennovations are superb - glorious room accomodations, new pools, jacuzzis and cabana chairs, with building facelifts inside and out to reflect a Hawai'ian seafaring feel. There are many new little shops to browse with unique items, not just the usual touristy fare. The new spa is awesome, and so is the fitness center. and they still have the 2 parrots in the lobby! There are 6 places to eat, and most are very pricey, so it was handy to have the breakfast in our package deal and then go out for a late lunch/dinner, or make sandwiches in our room and eat on the lanai. The staff were so sweet to us! Our lady from housekeeping, Adela, was so great and remembered me from my previous visits - she's workded there 25 years. All the desk people, concierge and Palm Terrace restaurant staff were gems. After reading some of the reviews, people should remember: aloha is like a boomerang - show aloha and it comes back to you. The drive to the resort is a real treat - take the H3 East and connect with the Kam Hwy and enjoy the beautiful coastline and tropical fruit roadstands along the way.

The pool/hot tub area was really cool, with the ocean waves rolling in just 20 feet from the pool...great view. Word of warning however, the pool is extremely cold. Maximum shrinkage factor. I found the ocean to be warmer. Tip...if you are interested in scuba diving for the first time, they offer a free course every Friday morning in the pool area at 9:30 to learn the basics and get used to the equipment. From there you can decide if you want to do an ocean dive. My wife and I did our very first dives from there and loved it. Stu the instructor was the best.

The service at the pool bar was sort of sloppy at times and it seemed like the workers where some of the original people that worked at this resort when it was a Hilton. This caused most of the children at the resort to swim in the smaller pool that the slide dumps into. This was sort of disappointing that the crowd could not really swim in the larger pool. Getting our chairs by the pool was difficult until we learned that after breakfast we needed to go out an claim our spot. Problem with this process is that there were chairs by the pool that no one used most of the day but they left their things there to save their spot.

Well, I know this business and apparently the management company does not. The staff is friendly as ever, and clueless.

The Bay CLub is still a dump, the Palm Terrace is so huge you could get lost, but I liked the food and service in 21 Degrees, just too expensive for every evening.

The hotel has several restaurants, but not a lot of variety in the food selections. It was either extremely pricey dinner selections, or overpriced burgers and pizza. Quality was a real issue. We ordered several meals that came to the table (or our room) cold, undercooked, or overcooked. Better bet for food, drive to Haleiwa to eat, or drive into Honolulu for special dinners.

I would definitely recommend this resort for a couple who wants some relaxation. I would NOT recommend this resort for those traveling with infants or toddlers -- like us! We were too confined when it rained. There was no where to go for shelter and the resort really did not cater to the very young. They advertised babysitting services, but we never were able to utilize one. As for the restaurants, the food was good and there was a large selection. The prices were occasionally fair -- if you could locate the price beforehand. We enjoyed the Sunday buffet at the Palm Terrace, but did not enjoy the price at $30 per person!

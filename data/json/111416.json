First of all, the power went out which meant cold showers, dark rooms and walking up 14 flights of stairs. Next, the lack of communcation on the part of the staff was unbelievable. We had no understanding of what had caused the power outage, when we could expect power to be restored (basically were told 4:30 then 8pm then 12midnight, etc...) to no avail. The staff gave out water and glow sticks if you happened to be \"hanging out\" in the lobby that also had no power or internet. If you left the hotel you had no idea about what was being offered guests. One surprise was that now that the light is on, I realize that the granola bars given to me were EXPIRED (1/12). I guess since it was dark we shouldn't notice, right? The noise in the hallways was loud as well as from the stairwells and outside. I would recommend the Hilton if you come to this location. Although Marriott may have a good name nationally (better than the Hilton chain which can be quite variable), the mgt at Hilton worked to have generators restore power, internet, hot showers quickly AND put guests up at an alternative Hilton locations (with free transportation) that had power. You might wonder what the guests at Marriott were given for the trouble? A $100 discount TOTAL for 3 nights stay (~ $33/night) on a $237/night room rate. Even with power this hotel is not worth it. Yes, the location is convenient to the convention center, but this property does not live up to the chain's reputation.

I asked for a different room and was given a much nicer, recently renovated room on the 24th floor, where we stayed for a week. The rooms are reasonably spacious, with the usual comfortable Marriott beds. I found the rooms a little noisy, with the doors between rooms letting sound through from adjoining rooms, and the window letting a bit too much noise through from the outside for my liking, despite being on the 24th floor. I spend half my life in a hotel in London and it is much quieter than this. However the staff were helpful and courteous, and the food at Champions, bar one night, was very nice. For Europeans travelling to this hotel, bear in mind that typically the US does not provide free alcohol in the Concierge Lounge, and this is no exception.

No need to worry here though, as we received very good service from the offset and a new large room on the 8th floor. As we were on our first visit to Boston, we were a bit nervous, having heard how Bostonians can be loud and abrupt. Certainly wasn't the case at this hotel, or in Boston in general. The front of house girl was very friendly and helpful in dealing with our reservation. In fact everybody from the bell hops up were always very friendly and approachable. The hotel itself was situated on the edge of the Back bay area- just great for seeing all the sites around this lovely city. We pre-booked a Olde Town Hop On/Hop Off bus tour- always the best way to explore a new city. One of the stops was actually in the entrance bay to the hotel! We also pre booked a bus trip to Wrentham Village Outlet Centre, with Boston Common Coach. Picked up and returned at our hotel foyer. We had a transit style minibus with 7 in total traveling, with a helpful driver and plenty of room for shopping bags Don't listen to any negative reviews about Wrentham- if you are looking for bargains make the trip- really good discounts on cheaper than UK prices! Not many bargains to be found around Boston city centre, that we could find- apart from Marshalls, in Bolyston street, but Wrentham is a much better experience! At the end of our trip to Boston we got the Amtrak train from Back Bay station (just through the attached shopping mall and over a road) to Penn station, New York. Would really recommend this journey along the New England coast- a good way to part of the country. Boston was great to see at this time of the year, mostly because we were very lucky with the weather (dry, sunny and cold when we were there- ideal for all the walking we did) and as it was `off season`, there weren't so many tourists about.

All in all, it's a great hotel. The rooms are adequately sized and very clean. Housekeeping was very good. The location of the hotel is terrific; part of the Copley complex and connected to Prudential Center. Dozens of stores and good restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, Legal Sea Foods, PF Chang, a good food court) are steps away. The hotel's own sports bar, Champions, was always busy and appeared very, very popular (it certainly was lively!). The service staff was helpful. As a Gold Level Marriott Rewards member, I believe this hotel a very good choice. Is it perfect? No. The rooms are clean, but somewhat dated (smallish bathrooms and standard sized tub/shower combinations). The hotel is remodeling floors one at a time. One morning their work woke me a bit earlier than I would have liked that day (8:15 am). Yes the concierge lounge is closed Friday afternoon to Sunday night, but most lounges are. Yes room service dishes seemed to hang around longer than most, apparently because retrieval is directly handled by room service and not by housekeeping. Yes, several times I had to wait two minutes or so for an elevator to the 28th floor. That said, I found the positives far outweighed any negatives. The location simply cannot be beat. The gym was particularly nice, with good, well maintained equipment (and plenty of it), and a nice pool. The lounge was very nice and I did not find it overcrowded. Housekeeping did a good job keeping my room clean. The in-room climate control worked well - so if I wanted to lower or raise the thermostat, it worked fine.

This one night stay exceeded my expectations, and my only regret was that we couldn't have stayed longer to enjoy the exceptional service provided by this property and staff! Let me explain ... Although reservations were made weeks before, I phoned the front desk the Thursday before our arrival to request an early check in, and arrange for a birthday cake gift to be delivered to our room. The Marriott associate politely explained that my request for an early check-in would be noted, but could not be guaranteed due to the fact that the hotel was booked the night before yet assured me that cake would be waiting and asked what flavor was preferred. Nice touch! As we were driving into Boston on the 12th, approximately 30 minutes from Copley Square, I phoned the front desk and inquired about the early check-in since it was well in advance of the 4:00PM standard check-in time. The voice on the other end recognized my name, and responded \"This is Grace, we spoke earlier this week. I'll contact housekeeping and see if the room you have been assigned is ready, otherwise I'll find you another room.\" I thanked her for her assistance. Upon arrival (2:00pm), the lobby was a flurry of activity and being a Elite Rewards member, we stepped up to the Elite check in and found that our (high floor, riverview) room was awaiting us. Way to go Grace!!! After a short wait at the elevator (yes there are different elevators for different floors of the hotel - this is NOT uncommon for high rise buildings, so those who reported this as confusing, I must disagree), we found our way to the 32nd floor, and found that our room 3232 was a spacious, nicely decorated, two room (LR/BR) suite with wonderful views. Additionally, all of my profile requests were honored - extra towels, refrigerator. Way to go GRACE!!! Shortly thereafter we heard a knock at the door, and housekeeping delivered two white, fluffy, comfy terrycloth robes. Another nice touch! After getting settled and having some time to relax, we decided to explore Boston, and found that the 2nd floor of the hotel was directly connected to the Copley Place Mall, with plenty of high end shopping. Another nice benefit was that this mall was connected to the Back Bay \"T\" station, which meant public transportation was available without having to step outside. The hotel also had a enclosed skybridge over Huntington Ave, which connected to the Shops at Prudential Center, where you could find even more retail and dining! At this point it was obvious to use that the Marriott Copley Place got it right with Location! After taking in some shopping and sharing Oysters at Legal Sea Food, we returned to our room to get ready for dinner and discovered an 8\" chocolate cake! It was exactly what I requested. Since we had reservations at Top of the Hub , we decided not to ruin our appetite and resisted the temptation. Although after dinner, we did slip into our robes and enjoyed the decadent birthday treat. Candles and matches were delivered with the cake also; this tells me the kitchen also knew to pay attention to the details. Yet another nice touch! After an excellent day and a wonderful night, we slept comfortably. Room darkening shades allowed us to sleep in much later than we should have, but I can't blame Marriott for that. Having a Starbucks in the hotel allowed us to enjoy SMC, sit and watch the world go by. One final request to have check out extended by one hour to 1:00pm, was met with a smile and agreed to. Since we weren't ready to leave Boston, we left our bags with the bellhop service while we took in more of the city. After plenty of walking and enjoying ourselves we returned to the hotel, retrieved our bags, and retrieved our car from valet (both hassle free) and set out for home. We loved our time in Boston, and realized a big part of that was due to the comfort and quality of our stay at the Marriott Copley Place.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bonita Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service\u201d", "Author": "CaribeAzul1", "ReviewID": "UR120522816", "Content": "Problem #1: When we arrived at 7 PM, our concierge level room was not available anymore.

We are business people at a convention. We are paying the rate, but not getting the service we are paying for. I could care less about the fact the wonderful personnel who take care of the Congierge Lounge need a break on weekend. Use it to train others. The least you can do is to open it and allow access to coffee and soda pop and water. Is that too much to ask, cheap hotel owners?

The fitness, swimming,spa area has been renovated and is greAt. The rooms are just OK and haven' changed much in the last decade. One of my other peeve is the lack ofnsheets and blankets.

With that said, of the myriad of hotels around the Copley area, the choices are abundant. The location of the Boston Marriott Copley Place has been it's prime reason for being filled with guests day 365 days of the year. It's connected to the Prudential building at Copley Place and the the Westin Plaza. It's right smack on Copley where it's a short stroll to most of the best places to see in Boston. The T is right at it's front and back. And even on a day when the weather is at it's worst, you can always run home to the Boston Marriott at Copley because it's so accessible to wherever you're coming from. So that's the good side. Now the down side. If there's a pet peeve I have, it's carpeting in a room that doesn't offer complimentary slippers. It's unhygienic to have a room covered in dark-colored wall to wall carpeting and there are no complimentary slippers. You can't see all that murk, mug and dirt covering the floor. While I understand they vacuum the carpets each day, it's still not good to have the floor covered with carpets unless you're offering slippers. There are no added bathroom amenities. With all the other hotels offering better amenities, it's sad that the Marriott has simply Body and Bath lotion, shampoo, conditioner and soap. This is also the first time that I've stayed in a hotel that has an envelope in the room for maid service. While it may not be mandatory, it's such a turn off that even the maids require a tip nowadays. Leaving an envelope in the room for tips for a job that is part of the job description is bad taste. The concierge is cold. Very very cold. They're not the kind of people you would want to ask for help or directions or anything at all. To say they are \"impersonal\" is being kind. The hotel should be more family and tourist friendly. But you won't get much help from them. Internet connection is $12.95 a day and they offer no packages for 3 or 5 or 7 days usages. Unless I was living inside the hotel room, this is a complete rip-off! Many hotels all over the world offer internet service for FREE nowadays. The hotel is expensive enough as it is and charging for added internet connection for a few hours at this rate is outrageous. Finally, Marriott should strip down the pictures it posts about hotel rooms. Don't get deceived. This is NOT what the rooms look like. They are old, weary and are (I believe) being renovated still. The elevators are enough proof as to the age and state of the hotel.

The central location was great and we enjoyed being able to walk to the Prudential Center Mall without leaving the hotel. Our only complaints were: - We chose the hotel bc it had a pool which is a huge treat for our 7 year old. However, we couldn't enjoy the pool bc it was very cold. I guess that's ideal for real swimmers who want a workout in a lap pool. Not great for kids and their parents who want to splash around. Next time, we'd go for a place with a smaller, warmer, more family friendly pool. - There was a large bank of elevators but only two or three seemed to be operational. Therefore, there was usually a 3-5 minute wait for an elevator and they were very crowded -- like a sardine can. Not fun for us or other passengers when getting on dripping wet from the pool, or smelly and sweaty from a workout. It was strange bc there were so many elevators; we couldn't figure out why they only had 2 or 3 in service. Also escalator to ground floor was not working so you had no choice but to use the elevator from the second floor where the restaurant, shops and entrance to mall is located. - Missed having a fridge in the room. There IS a \"cooler\" that looks like a mini-fridge, but it is not cold. There was a note in the room that said it would keep things cold, but wouldn't chill something not already cold. I found it kept nothing cold. Perhaps that's a cost-cutting measure for the hotel? - Restaurant was good but pricey. Really good breakfast buffet, but for a party of two adults and one child, it was a whopping $50 bucks! It should either be free or discounted if you're staying at the hotel, in my opinion.

It's air-conditioned in the hot summers and heated in the cold winters - and very safe at night. The staff were very professional, but genuinely nice. If you stop at the concierge desk and tell them what stores you plan to visit, you might luck out and get a coupon. Be sure to check out the theater district. That was a lot of fun and there are some great shows. I didn't rent a car either time. With moderate traffic it took about 20 minutes one-way. Supershuttle was cheaper than a taxi, but neither was very expensive. Of course if you are in a hurry or don't like sharing a ride either rent a car or take a taxi.

However, the location is excellent for shopping, sight seeing, or dinning out. The front desk and bell station seems to be poorly organized and checking into the hotel was difficult. While it was not busy, at check-in, it was understaffed leading to delays. Also, although my profile states a WSJ is the be delievered to my door, this did not happen, evern with reminders. Extra towels were not left in room as requested. At check-in I was told the club longue was closed, however it is open during the evening. Wirless InterNet is available only in lobby or 2nd floor.

Issue three - the air conditioner would not stop running after the second day there. Maintenance would have fixed it but we were leaving the next morning anyway and didn't want to bother with it. Issue four - when I reported the mattresses and the air conditioning, the response I got was \"Oh, sorry about that. Hope your stay is better next time.\" ARE YOU SERIOUS?

Especially if they are standing right in front of you. We finally had to ask the concierge for help. Not one of the suits could be bothered to stop their personal conversations.

When we arrived we were disappointed to find that we were located in two separate areas of the hotel neither of which came close to meeting our requested general area. One room was acceptable but the other on a different floor didn't even come close to meeting our approximate location and view. I wasn't prepared to look at the top of the air conditioning/heating system on the floor below for our 4 night stay and especially at big city Marriott prices. The staff at the check in desk was helpful in making the change to a more desirable location. The lesson for me is not to expect reservation requests to be honored even at a Marriott and be prepared to check out the room and request a change if needed.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "BrooklynCarolT", "ReviewID": "UR115295835", "Content": "Perfect spot for the heart of Boston.

Even the staff handling our bags were fabulous. *Concierge level amazing with offerings. *Connected to the Prudential and over 300 shops. *Valet parking. *Amazing view of the Charles River and Hancock Building. *I will certainly stay here again. *Lots of closet space. *T to Prudentail vs Copley stop so you can stay inside vs walking outside. Neutrals: *Small bathrooms with sink in the bathroom. Though functional, despite several women and girls having to get ready at the same time. *First fridge smelled like sour milk and made all our snacks and beverage smell. Though a replacement was obtained quickly. *Housekeeping overly wanting to get into our room. We put up the do not disturb sign our second night. *No table and chairs in living room area. Negatives: *Valet parking cost $44 a night. *Torn wallpaper in adjoining room bathroom. *Not warned about handicapped room. *Biggest pet peave - hallway filled with dishes, etc throughout each day of our stay (3 days). These were not picked up until later in the night, I would say after eight pm. I think this should have been monitored better. One night it was an awful site to see the number of dishes in the hallway, especially when our breakfast dishes were in the hallway later in the evening. *The pool looks like it's picture on the Marriott website, except the view is not the same as the picture - they must have photoshopped the buildings. The picture view from the pool was an exciting one for us, but the reality was nothing like the picture on the website - I think this was very deceiving by Marriott. The view from the 32nd floor was amazing and worth staying in our room for and having a few drinks.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haddonfield, NJ", "Title": "\u201cLike staying in a shopping mall\u201d", "Author": "Medstrike", "ReviewID": "UR98442820", "Content": "If you want the feel of staying in a shopping mall, this is the place for you \"Just OK\" was used in an earlier review and that was our reaction after two nights here over President's Day Weekend.

I left my luggage with the one and only doorman and headed for the adjoining self-park garage. My daughter began the check-in process.

It is in the Back Bay area, and is part of the high-end Copley Place mall. The views of Boston and the Charles River from the upper floors are nice. This is what you are paying for. My room was nice -- slightly above average but not that much different from some of the other Marriotts I frequently stay at, including the Courtyard and other lesser lines within the Marriott chain. The bed was very comfortable, and I slept very well. A nice flat-panel TV and coffee maker were in room. The bathroom was standard size, but nice and clean, and everything worked. Besides the location in the Back Bay area, the hotel is also close to the Back Bay rail and subway station. I did not have a car, but I doubt that parking is anywhere close to free. Internet cost about $13 a day; expensive, but typical for a hotel like this. The front desk staff was a bit confused with my room assignment, but after patiently explaining my situation several times, they overcame their reluctance to listen and finally realized that I did indeed have a problem that needed to be straightened out. However, every night when I would walk through the lobby, I'd see a line waiting to check in. On my last night there, there were at least a half-dozen people waiting in line. This should not happen at any hotel, especially one as upscale as this Marriott. For a hotel this size (there were well over 30 floors), they clearly need to put the customer first and hire more front-desk staff. The fitness center, which is on the 5th floor, was very good, and was one of the best I have seen. There seemed to be plenty of treadmills and ellipticals, some strength machines, and even a small pool. I was on the 28th floor, and would often have to wait a while for an elevator.

For Christmas this year and last, we have stayed at the Marriott Copley Place and have been very impressed. We have stayed at other Boston hotels rated four stars or better on Tripadvisor, but the Marriott is our favorite. I will review our most recent trip, but our 2009 trip was basically identical. Check-in was quite easy and courteous. On each of these visits, I had booked through a major travel consolidator and paid an absurdly low rate of under $100 per night - tax included. Yet treatment at check-in was as if I were inner circle paying full price. I was asked if I had any requests. I asked for a non-adjoining room. I was given a corner room on the top floor. I was given a corner room the previous year, also. The room was of a good size and in good condition. Though it has been some time since the last refurb, it was obvious that maintenance was done regularly. Repeated use keeps any room from being perfect (our room had an iron burn on the carpet from guest use). Three examples point out care to me. First, the HVAC vents were clean, obviously vacuumed. I find this a rarity in hotels. Second, caulk and grout in the bathroom had been maintained. Third, no scuff marks on walls. These are just three indicative samples. One minor complaint - towels were average at best. Good bedding, TV, safe, good coffee maker, and fridge/chiller. Good desk set and separate lounge chair. The room was quiet by hotel standards. Service - The front desk has been covered. Our room safe could not be opened and our fridge seemed warm. We called the desk. The units were replaced within 15 minutes. Housekeeping worked at a stealth level. They did not make noise in the halls as they worked. We had a late start each morning and they had already done the first shift in our wing and moved on to another wing. Each day we would go out in the late morning for about one to two hours and the room would be done - done well each time upon our return. Vacuuming each day. No hand prints on the floor-to-ceiling windows. Well done. Bell staff we encountered within the building would always say hello. Doormen were a bit more stoic. Facility - There are different areas in Boston one may wish as a starting point. The Marriott occupies an excellent one. As mentioned in most reviews, it is enclosed attached to two malls, very advantageous as we were bombed by the recent blizzard. One allows access to a branch of the MBTA Green line; one to the Orange line. Public transportation got us to our terminal at the airport in 40 minutes for $3.40 for two, and this was the day after the blizzard. A large Shaw's grocery store is directly across the street for supplies. In good weather, most all main attractions are within walking distance. The second floor of the lobby has a giant sports bar/restaurant complex. It serves better than average bar-style food. Slightly pricey, but not too bad. Our servers have always been good. Starbucks and a candy kiosk there, also. There are two computers and printers in the lobby for boarding passes only. Very convenient. The elevators to the upper floors can be a bit slow in arriving. *Of special note - the indoor pool, hot tub, exercise facility, and locker rooms are phenomenal and well cared for. A year had passed since my last visit and there was not a single sign of additional wear and tear - very well maintained. We noted that there was an attendant there who WORKED. In the hour I was there, I saw him straighten furniture, collect and distribute towels, dust workout equipment, and dust windows. I read one reviewer's complaint about the hours of the gift shop. I noticed the unpredictable hours, also. When the reviewer was told by a front desk worker that she could not be sure if the shop was open, I can understand. It strikes me not as a lack of knowledge by a Marriott employee, but rather the unpredictability of what is probably a privately leased facility. One final note. The blizzard ground things to a halt in Boston the night of December 26. Marriott put up their employees that needed to stay that evening or were stranded. I know that some might say that it was also to guarantee staff at the hotel the next day, but I see it as a quality gesture on this Marriott's part.

From the 20th floor you get a superb view of Boston, but your room is box-like with thin walls and noise can carry from the neighbouring room. The decor is smart and pleasant but the rooms have no character. Internet isn't free (which I think many holidaymakers find infuriating) and costs around 12 dollars unless you use the lounge area where it is free. There is no proper residents' lounge - it resembles an airport departure lounge and at around midnight an officious hotel employee shouted at my sons (aged 18 and 21) to leave the lounge because it was closing. There was in fact little sign of respect or consideration for the customer - we might as well have been at an airport. Lots of people on conferences were drinking and networking and maybe it's ideal if you're on a conference with an expense account. For a family on holiday it felt unpleasant and unwelcoming. Breakfasts were excellent and there was plenty of good food. Valet car parking at 40 dollars a day but I hear it's worse in some other US cities.

We arrived a little bit too early and parked our car in the Prudential Center Garage. First, it was not so easy to find the right way to the hotel from there but we found it quickly. The staff at check in were very nice, it was no problem that we were there before the official check in time. I asked for a room on the upper floors with a view and the woman at the reception gave us a nice room on the 31th floor. Although we booked the hotel via Priceline, we did not get a typical Priceline room (e.g. behind the elevator). The room was not that spacious, but had a great King bed with 6 pillows, a desk and an extra relaxing chair, a LCD TV with variuos TV stations and a nice bathroom. The room was absolutely clean and as a welcoming gift we received a plate with cheese and fruit and a bottle of wine - nice idea. We saw the Prudential Tower from our room, also some not so nice roofs but we liked the view. Some reviewers wrote about the slow elevators, I would say the waiting time is average, depending on the time of day. They were not exceptionally slow but if they were on the first floor and you called them to the 31st - well, it takes some time, even for an elevator ;) I liked the connection to the Prudential and the Copley Mall, everything was so near, e.g. the food court in Prudential Mall and the Au Bon Pain in Copley Mall, which I can recommend. We never ate at the hotel, but the Champions Bar looked nice and there is also a Starbucks. Newbury and Boylston Street are a 5 minute walk away and there is a Shaw's supermarket right across the street. The next T-station (Prudential) is about 3 minutes away and the Old Town Trolley stops right in front of the hotel (tickets can be bought at the Concierge or the special Trolley counter besides the entrance). To the Trinity church it's a 10 minute walk and another 10 minute walk to the Boston Common. Everything that you need is right in the neighborhood - liked that a lot. What I did not like so much was that you had to pay for the internet in the room, okay, but that's common. At least there was free wi-fi-connection in the lobby, but the sitting area there was always crowded. Until 4 pm we could sit in the Connexion loung on the second floor, which is much more comfortable, but they close at 4 for paying audience. All in all I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

Although the area and lobby are very busy, the rooms are very quiet, comfortable and well appointed. We stayed in a king room on the conciere level. An excellent hot breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks, soft beverages and bar were available on this floor only. Ahhhh, the beds....if we weren't in such an interesting town, we could have slept in them 24/7! Incredibly comfortable. I have a bad back and they were not too soft, just right! Beautifully appointed rooms w/ appx. 42\" flat screen t.v. w/ plenty of channels. We had a view of the Charles River (downside-costs $30 extra to face river). However, you can request view of the bay for no extra charge. Bathrooms clean but small for two people. Safes in room, good visible security ie: cameras, guards...good section of town. Excellent large workout facility. Many cardo machines each had t.v.'s ie: incline ellipitals & treadmills, had everything you could want including free weights, fitness balls, mats, etc. We used it every day. Nice pool w/ separate lap lane. Large hot tub. GREAT customer service everywhere in this hotel. Bar had dozens of large t.v. screens. Although very busy, it was a great place to watch your favorite sports games. Got this room on Priceline for $120- a steal! You just enter the different amenities/the area: Copley Square and you'll get this Marriott or the Boston Sheraton which also gets rave reviews. (We were upgraded to the conciere rm. because other wasn't available). The Old Town Trolley -Hop on-Hop off, was great for seeing the city on the first sightseeing day. Guides were entertaining and informative. The second day is free which is perfect for going back to the places that interest you the next day. Stops just outside the door. Buy tickets on-line to save money. Duck tour is across the street-would recommend for families w/ young kids. However, it is a non-stop tour w/ no free second day. Kind of silly for adults only. The \"T\" subway is 2 or 3 blocks away. We took it from the airport ($2) and back to save the $30 cab fare each way. Very good for getting to Waterfront, Freedom trail, Cambridge, USS Constitution, North End (Little Italy-be sure and have dinner, pizza by the slice for lunch and Mike's Pastry's Cannoles here!) and other outlining areas. Busline is confusing for visitors. Downsides: Internet in room $12 a day, 59 cents a min. in business center. However, there is a Kinkos in adjacent mall for about 26 cents a min. Must pay to park. We did not rent a car as Boston is too busy to navigate....parking almost impossible to find and then parking time very limited. Plenty of taxis and great public transportation. Besides, this hotel is centrally located, just a few blocks from Isabella Gardner Museum, Museum of Art, Fenway, Trinity Church, Newberry Street Shopping and public transportation. Best location for vacationers. Oh, the AMAZING mall connected to this hotel by walkways... has hundreds of excellent stores for every taste. Plan a day for shopping here and on Newberry Street, a few blocks away. Ask the front hotel desk for a complimentary refrigerator brought to your room....there is a huge grocery store/deli across the street. Has everything imaginable. We got hot meals from the deli, snacks, water and wine/beer and brought back to the room. Be forwarned that alcohol in bars is very expensive! Glass of Beringer wine-half full= $8.00, beer $6.00 or more almost everywhere in Boston. Only reason you may not like this hotel is if you prefer quaint, cozy boutique-like hotels. Or if you are traveling with small children and are primarily visiting the aquarium and other child oriented venues and need a hotel with complimentary breakfast. I would recommend you stay nearer to Freedom trail, child museum or the Aquarium in a chain hotel which offers complimentary breakfast. Military retirees and personnel can stay at The Constitution Inn for $99 per night. My military son-in-law/ daughter stay there and say it is great for the price.

Loved being attached to the mall and the Pru. When we wanted to get off of the busy Boston streets we just hopped through any door nearby. The parking was easy and self park was less than valet ($35/day). The rooms were plenty big enough for the 3 of us. Having the fridge made life easier with leftovers. The beds were big and comfy. We had breakfast at the restaurant on the 2nd floor. The buffet looked good but for $18 was too pricey for what I'd eat. The kids were only $5 so that made more sense for them. I ordered off the menu and was satisfied. Loved all the elevator options. Never seemed to wait more than a couple of minutes.

The bedding was really comfortable, but the mattress sunk a little (not exactly uncomfortable, but noticeable). Housekeeping was excellent.

We took the Downeaster from Maine and a taxi from North Station to the hotel. You can easily take the T or subway, but we didn't want to deal with luggage on the T so we treated ourselves to a taxi. They are right there outside North Station and the fare was about $15 for the 10 minute ride. Luck was with us and the room was ready when we arrived at 11 am. We settled in and found the room clean and up to Marriott standards. We ate a very pricey breakfast buffet at the hotel on the first day because we were hungry and didn't know where else to go yet. The next day we found a great little restaurant further down the street called Thorntons. (Take a left out of the hotel and walk down Huntington and you can't miss it) The hotel is connected by an enclosed walkway to the Prudential Center mall and considering it was very hot when we where there, it was nice to stay in air conditioning as long as possible. There is a Starbucks right in the Hotel, and a Dunkin Donuts across the street. In the mall is a food court and a few sit down restaurants . From the mall you can access the Prudential Skywalk and the Top of the Hub restaurant and Lounge. You can also buy tickets for the Duck Tours. Tours depart across the street from the hotel. The Shaws across the street was a great place to get water and other snacks for the room. The theater district is about at 15 to 20 minute walk down Stuart Street. The Wilbur, Wang and Shubert are all right there when Stuart and Tremont intersect. The comedian we saw at the Wilbur theater was hilarious as expected. The Wilbur is a grand old theater and they are doing a lot to restore it. However, the air conditioning could not keep up with a packed house and it got extremely hot. As is the case with most older theaters, the seats are small and very close together so be prepared to get very cozy with the person sitting next to you.

The internet charge is $12.95/day and if you want to use your computer in the restaurant or other areas of the hotel, you have to pay an additional charge or go to the Sheraton where it is free (according to Marriott personnel).

Our room had a nice, large flat-screen tv with several high-definition channels, but the tv was tucked away in a corner and difficult to view from most of the room (I think on account of the room shape). Our room seemed pricey for a conference rate, but after checking, any decent hotel in Boston is in the $150-$200 range. I probably would not have stayed here on my own, unless I got a much better rate. The conference facilities were very nice, although spread over three floors. Fortunately, there are several escalators in a large atrium, which makes accessing the various conference facilities very easy. The hotel is linked to two shopping malls, one of them upscale. There are also plenty of restaurants nearby (try the crabcakes at Legal Seafood!). Also, if you venture out into the neighborhood, there are several nice shops and restaurants within a few blocks' walk to Boylston Street and Newbury Street. Be sure to walk the extra block over to Newbury, as it turned out to be full of quaint shops and restaurants in some very neat old buildings. The hotel is also close to Copley Square and the beautiful Trinity Church. Finally, the Duck Tours board right across the street (also highly recommended) and there is also a large Shaw's grocery store across from the hotel. My only complaints about the Marriott were 1) charging extra for in-room Internet access. While we were checking in, someone else was complaining to the front desk and asking to have the charges removed from their bill. This service is an extra $12.95 a day and considering the cost to stay here, should be included. We stayed at five other less expensive hotels on this trip, and NONE charged for Internet service! I was able to pick up some weak unsecured wireless networks in our room, but barely enough signal to check e-mail; and 2) for all of the elevators in this hotel, waits for an elevator were often long and then the elevators were often full to capacity.

The location of the hotel is also wonderful--there is a supermarket across the street and it is connected to two shopping malls that provide many shopping and dining options. It is also accessible by both the Green and Orange T lines. That said, I have to say this was the most unpleasant four-star hotel stay I've ever had. I went with a group of people from work for a conference, and each manager had three rooms reserved on her corporate credit card. We all checked in together, and even though I asked the (very bored, very nonchalant) desk clerk to put my Marriott card on my room for incidentals, he did not bother to register me or my other colleague as guests of the hotel--all three rooms were registered in the name of the person whose credit card paid for the room. Subsequently when my key card got demagnetized the next day. the clerk demanded that the one registered guest accompany me to the desk and show her id before they would issue me new keys! Unfortunately, she had contracted food poisoning from eating at Champions Sports Bar in the hotel the night before, and couldn't leave her room, let alone come to the front desk. The clerk finally had to have a security guard accompany me to my room and I had to recite the contents of my room before I could gain admittance--and even then, I could not get a new key card until the next day when my colleague's condition improved and she could visit the desk. No one apologized for the inconvenience, and instead multiple staff members scolded me for not registering myself as a guest!!! On the day we were scheduled to check out, many people in our group were attending a symposium that ended 30 minutes before checkout time, and when they got back to their rooms their keys had already been deactivated and they could not get their luggage. By that time there was a huge line at the front desk and again, a security guard had to accompany them to their rooms and let them in to their rooms. I think the most annoying thing about this hotel (if there is anything more annoying than food poisoning) is the double bank of incredibly slow, overburdened elevators that service floors 1-27. We regularly waited up to 10 minutes to take the elevators during the day, which is maddening when you are attending a convention and need to run upstairs during breaks. I would definitely recommend requesting a high floor, because the single bank that served the upper floors was much faster. I have many concerns about the security of a hotel that allows unregistered people to occupy its rooms; I also wonder about the safety of such a system, and worry about how they would account for guests in the event of a fire or other emergency. I suppose in that situation they would just shrug and say it was the guests' fault, and not their problem. But if you don't mind making the extra effort to deal with a hotel that doesn't care about you or your comfort and safety, and you can get a good rate here, I guess I would say go for it.

For example I requested a late check out, however my card key was expired and I need to refresh it. Worse is someone crash in to check room while I changing. Definitely not to stay there again. By the way, so many other choices around there, right?", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cJust another hotel.

The wife and I stayed there for 5 nights. I have no real complaints about the hotel, save for a couple of quibbles. Check in was fast on a Sunday. The bell hop was very friendly and offered us a complimentary refrigerator for our room. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. There were only 2 bath towels, which I thought was a bit surprising, but the maid gave us more whenever we asked. The shower drain was a tiny bit slow. It wasn't slow enough that you were standing in a pool of water during your shower, but it did slowly accumulate. The TV remote was worn and the buttons didn't always work. There was also no tv guide on their menu to figure out what was playing. You had to just flip through the channels. That was a bit annoying, but I wasn't there to watch TV. The room wasn't spacious, but it wasn't cramped either. Check out for us was on Friday at 10:00. We asked for a late checkout, but they only granted us until 10:30. In my previous experiences at other hotels, I have always been given noon as a late checkout. The hotel is connected to a large mall, which is nice. And you could actually walk from the hotel through the mall to the John B Hynes convention center (where my conference was) without going outside. That was very convenient. And the wife and I could also walk through the mall at night to save walking distance on the way to whichever restaurant we were going to. The rates were a bit pricey, but so were the rates of all comparable hotels in the area. It was cheaper than the nearby Sheraton, by about $50/night. Non valet parking was $35/day, valet parking was $42/day. The parking at the Sheraton was a bit more expensive. Oh, and there's no business center with free internet access. You can, of course, bring your own laptop and pay a daily fee. Amusing sidenote - When I asked the concierge to recommend a restaurant for lunch one day, he tried to direct me to the hotel restaurant. Thanks, but no thanks. (Maybe he gets a commission.)

I personally wouldn't pay $18 to workout there, but as a Hilton Diamond dude, it was comped. Anyway, the real purpose of my review is to publicly commend the housekeeping staff. I left a straightening iron in the bathroom upon checking out, and didn't realize it for 24 hours. I called and left a voicemail with housekeeping on a Saturday. I called again on Monday and while placed on hold, someone actually contacted housekeeping.

The only thing missing is a hotel bar but there are plenty of those close by. You are able to buy beer and other drinks from the hotel lobby fridge which is a plus. Except for the 4:30 unexpected wake up call by the fire alert system which directed us to please leave the room and take the stairs to the lobby to be met with Boston's finest fireman (mind you a false alarm) we highly recommend this hotel when visiting Boston.

The bellstaff and doorman are great to work with! Charles and Tony were especially helpful during my stay, especially when I had several heavy boxes that needed shipping due to the conference I was working. As one review mentioned, this is very much a conference hotel, so the hotel layout can get confusing. There are two sets of elevators, one for floors 1-27 and another for floors 1-5 then 27-38. The elevator chime is soft, so for someone hard of hearing like myself, I missed a few elevators at first. Once I got the hang of it, though, I was OK. My room was on the 17th floor and faced the Prudential center. I had a king bed and the room was very nicely sized for a hotel in the downtown area. the bedding was the newer collection and the television had been upgraded to the flat-screen. There was a small fridge in the dresser, which was nice although your items had to be cold before you put them in there. The bathroom was decently sized and for a 6-day trip, it was nice to be able to spread out. The water pressure was OK, especially if you enjoy the \"rainshower\" type of shower heads. If you're looking for a hard-driving shower, prepare to be disappointed. The rest of the staff was very pleasant to work with and the bellman were very helpful in getting packages/items from the meeting rooms down to shipping/receiving or the UPS store. This is the first hotel I've stay at that has had a UPS store located inside (usually, it's FedEx or an independent company). While the staff was OK, it was very frustrating to learn that packages insured for over $999 were not accepted and that the packages would have to be taken down to shipping/receiving. The bellmen were very nice about it (obviously used to this little caveat), but I found it very frustrating. Regarding the restaurants, yes they are a bit pricey and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. As a solo business traveler, I tend to default to the hotel restaurants because of safety concerns. Champions is decent and serves typical Marriott sports bar food; the Terrace Bar is a bit more upscale but has a smaller menu, and on Thursday and Friday nights, has live entertainment. Gourmeli's is decent as well. BONUS: Shaw's 24-hour grocery store is located across the street, so you can bypass the expensive gift shop for sodas and munchies (as well as toiletries). My biggest complaint is about the internet service and Marriott's continuing insistence on charging $13/night for service. This is frustrating for a business traveler who needs the connectivity.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Silver with Marriott, and successfully begged for one of the corner rooms mentioned in other postings. Yes, much larger, and had great space for Kiddo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollaway. We had Concierge Lounge access, which is helpful for morning beverages and munchies. The room was an ok mix of Marriott 1.0 and 2.0. They still had the Desk That Works, which is great when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on solo travel, but not helpful with multiple folks in the room. The bed was the new Revive bedding, which was nice, and the bathroom vanity/counter/mirror was new. Carpet, wallpaper, armoire with tube tv, all still waiting patiently for their kiss at the pig. A small fridge was brought in for Kiddo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuff, and no charge, so that was nice. Internet is wired, and strong\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 happy here.

LONG REVIEW\u201d", "Author": "alli565", "ReviewID": "UR14563141", "Content": "We just returned from four nights at the Marriot Copley. We (it was my husband, my sixteen year old and myself) booked this hotel based on its proximity to BU and Northeastern University, Newbury Street shops, the malls, and historic Boston. We also used three nights of Marriott points and then paid $229 for the fourth night. We chose these dates because of Spring Break in Virginia. We had an excellent stay, and let me say that there was an initial aghast moment when we checked in along with thousands of Anime Conventioneers! Check in was simple (we arrived two hours late due to the tardiness of our flight out of Reagan National), we were given our request of a top floor (room 3045)--this was a corner room and at the very end of the hall which was great since it meant that the only people heading down to our end of the hall would be us! In retrospect, I wish I had asked for an even higher floor, or even tried to get club level or an upgrade, but what I was given was perfect at the time. Before critiquing the hotel too much, I will say that I am a Marriott Timeshare owner, so when I go away for either a night or seven nights, it has usually been in a Springhill Suites-style room, or a timeshare (apartment-like). I haven't stayed in a Marriott Hotel-style room in a very long time, so this took some getting used to (without a sitting area or kitchen, so to speak). There is a chair, small table and lamp against the long wall with the window. The bathroom is small. I didn't love that there wasn't an exhaust fan, the spray of the shower (pressure), the yellow staining on the wallpaper (near the floor and possibly glue coming from behind the paper), or that they turned the water off Sunday night from 12-6am (this would have been okay if our sink water had come back on at six am...instead when we called downstairs at seven to report that there wasn't any water running after an initial try of getting black water, we were told to just keep it on and it \"will eventually come on\". It didn't, we brushed our teeth using the tub water, and reported it to maintenance (it was on when we returned to the room that afternoon). And there was a letter slipped under our door letting us know the water would be cut off for those six hours (someone else on this post had written about this during his stay as well). There could be much, much better lighting in the bathroom and a better hairdryer (not turbo enough for long hair). But it was clean, enabled two people to stand next to each other and put on makeup ( a bit cramped, but possible), and provided us with the dryer, toiletries, etc I didn't love that I had a full wall of windows plus more once rounding out the corner (about three feet of the next wall), but the bottom half was \"foggy\". I did love that the top half was BIG enough that the bottom half could be avoided and I got tons of great pictures of the Charles River and beyond. I didn't love the double beds (I would have preferred two queens), but I really do love those Marriott pillows! I didn't love the fee for the Internet for the cost of the room. Yes, it did seem like it took a while for them to clean up the dishes from the halls (a few coffee mugs and wine glasses) like another poster wrote. But the cleaning crew were always working (remember we had a full house of ANIME people...look it up if you don't know what they are...or perhaps you are one of them?). We ate at Champions the first night since we arrived late and wanted to get acclamated to the area. I loved that the malls were attached, and since I left my hairbrush at home (!), I loved that Shaws is across the street (snacks, hairbrush, sodas, EVERYTHING you need). The restaurant was good, but I tried not to go to any other chain while in Boston. We were touring colleges for my daughter (mission accomplished), saw Boston (never been before), took the Trolley Tour (can get tickets right at the Marriott and pick up Trolley there), explored the \"T\" (very easy--get everyone put on the Charlie Card and it is even easier), tried many great restaurants (listed below) and did a lot of walking! If I didn't have the points to use for a free night stay, I would probably comparison shop and look into the Westin as a possibility. Just for a change. The Marriott has always done right by me. And the fact that this hotel is connected to the malls, the convention center, extremely close to the \"T\", has a grocery store across the street, the Duck tour boats and Trolleys right at the entrance.....so many pros and very, very few cons. We ate breakfast at Brassiere Jo (three minute quick walk away), Mike's City Diner (fifteen minute even quicker walk away--it was chilly so fast walking was easy for us!), and Thornton's Diner (two more mins past Brassiere Jo's). Had wonderful waffles and you have to order the double hot chocolate at Brass. Jo's. Thorntons had excellent crepes and we liked the home fries/potatoes there the best. And Mike's had phenomenal waffles (cinnamon walnut). Brass. Jo's is french so the waffles tasted a bit different than what you'd expect (wheat?) and the hot choc. was thick and came with small crocks of whipped cream on the side. We ate lunch at Bartleys Burger Cottage (near Harvard)...if you can get past the nasty, rude girl passing out menus outside (and yes, we had a ten minute wait outside on a Saturday at two pm, and we placed our order right there on the street with a man that was taking the orders outside and then having them run inside for a head start!), the people inside are very nice. EXPECT cramped quarters! Small and dark inside. The burgers weren't anything spectacular. They have many choices, a huge menu, and it is the ambience/atmosphere/age that we went for...and Rachael Ray recommending it had me curious. We had Easter Lunch at Upper Crust since many places in Little Italy had special menus or weren't open yet (never made it to Giaccomo's due to timing on our part). I loved Upper Crust's pizza. And we also ate lunch one day in Little Italy at Caffe della Sport (it was very, very good...paninis and pizza and very good). Finally, we ate dinners at The Pourhouse (on Boylston and maybe ten min walk from hotel). It is a pub, and we had good wraps, wings and cheesesteaks. Dark though and the service wasn't great. I would go again, because of the size of the menu and the proximity to the hotel, but it wasn't \"all that\". Firefly was AWESOME. It is on Dartmouth and literally twenty yards maybe from a mall entrance (so you aren't outside for very long if you walk through the mall). I had Pumpkin Lasagna (!), my daughter had the special (ravioli---very good), and the steak was good as well. I enjoyed that restaurant a lot. Easy to get to, quick, efficient and good service. JP Licks was endured since we walking Newbury Street and just had to stop in for some odd flavored ice creams (we just had to). We had gelato in Quincy Market, and of course we ate many cannoli's in Mike's Pastry. We also gave in to one other chain and had cheesecake in bed from the Cheesecake Factory.

I stayed here for four nights in February. The location is hard to beat- in the heart of the Back Bay area, about 15 minutes walk to downtown along lovely streets with lots of shops and restaurants close by. There is a Subway stop very close to the hotel. The nice thing about the hotel is its connection to two shopping centres (Copley Place and Prudential Centre): if it`s raining or snowing, you don't even have to step outside. You could litterally spend days in this huge complex, shopping in mid to high level stores and eating at the numerous restaurants (mostly food court type of places but also a good number of \"sit down\" restaurants). I took a cab from the aiport to the hotel, which cost about $40 (note that although the hotel is actually very close to the airport, there is a $12 toll fee for every car driving through the Logan Aiport and this is added on to your cab fare). At the end of my stay, I returned to the airport via shuttle bus, just as quick as a cab and only cost $15. The shuttle leaves the hotel for the airport every 20 minutes. Check in was very quick and easy. My room was located on the 26th floor. The room was a good size and absolutely spotless. There's a refrigerator in the room, so that was quite handy for keeping my water bottles cool. The best part of the room? The bed! It had a pillow-top mattress and was very comfortable. I slept like a baby (also helped that the room was very quiet- I was not once disturbed by noise in other rooms or in the hallway). Service at the hotel was very good. The concierge was quite helpful as was front desk personnel. I asked for a late check-out (flight in late afternoon) and this was no problem whatsoever. There's a Starbucks on the second floor which was handy. I had the breakfast buffet one morning at the restaurant on the 2nd floor. Although a tad pricey (about $20) it was worth it. I'm not usually a fan of buffet anything (usually large quantities of disgusting food) but the food was actually really good. I didn't have dinner at the hotel but ate a few times in some restaurants in the Copley and Prudential Centre. Legal Seafood- pretty good for a chain-type restaurant, nice atmosphere, great service and decent seafood. California Pizza Kitchen- give this a miss- worst pizza I've ever eaten.

I would say that it's mainly because I don't have much more to say beyond what others have already said. Five of us shared a room on the 24th floor, facing the river, and really enjoyed the hotel. I do agree that the lobby was a bit chaotic. My other gripe would be that the elevator situation just was not great. There was an AAS (I believe) conference at the hotel the same weekend we were there and at one point we had to wait about 20mins for an elevator. It seemed like only 4 of the 6 elevators to the 1st 26 floors were working and it was really a pain to get up to our room. Also with 5 people in the room we showed up in our room that had 2 double beds to find 2 towels. That's just a silly number of towels for a room with 2 beds. My other complaint would be the collection of beer caps under the beds and the two 40oz Corona bottles behind the curtains. That to me either says they didn't clean very well, or the maids were getting drunk in our room?? (2nd part is more of a *wink**wink*). Other than those issues, the hotel was really nice. The ability to walk via Skywalks to places in the area was really convenient since we were there in February & it was quite cold. Also, the Shaw's grocery store across the street from the hotel was really convenient for picking up snacks, bottled water, etc. I'd definitely choose the same location again, probably even the same hotel. The T line stops were very close. We actually avoided the sky-high parking at the hotel by parking off of the Orange line on our way in from Manchester Airport.

My husband and I were traveling with our 11 month old son who had some appointments at Boston Children's Hospital. We always do some research before booking our hotels and found this one to have great reviews. We had a wonderful experience here. We had a corner room on the 17th floor and had a nice view of the city. The internet connection was good and the room itself was very spacious. The bathroom seemed a little smaller than most hotels, but still very nice. The beds are super comfy too! The staff was very helpful with the baby. They brought up a baby bed with the works (crib, bumper pad, sheets, baby blankets, etc.) They also brought us a warmer to use for the baby's milk. We really appreciated this. I believe this is the cleanest place we have ever stayed. The housekeeping is superb. Each day we were out, we came back to a very clean room with fresh bed linens and fresh towels. As we walked down the hallway to our room, my husband and I always commented on how clean it smelled. The staff is very nice also. Check in was very smooth. We are not sushi people, but food from the sushi bar looked and smelled very good too. One important reason we decided to stay in the Back Bay area was to be close to restaurants, shopping, etc. Since we had an infant, we needed things to be as hassle free as possible. We also didn't want to have to drag the baby in and out of the cold so the walkway to the Prudential and Copley malls were nice. We did eat at Legal's Seafood (at the Prudential.) It was very good. I had calamari for the first time and it was very delicious. We also ate at the food court quite a bit inside the Prudential and the variety was very nice. Having a grocery store across the street was nice as well, since there is only one snack machine (on the 31st floor) in the entire hotel which was usually empty. There are soda machines on every floor though. The only thing we didn't like was the elevators. There are plenty of them with hardly no wait, but only some of them go to floors 1-27. The others go to higher levels and didn't go to our room level (on the 17th floor.) We accidentally got on the wrong one and had a difficult time getting back to the right one. We had it down pat by our second day. This was a little bit confusing. But other than that, we loved this place and definitely plan on staying here again when we return for more appointments.

It was my in-laws' first time in the USA - suffice to say that Boston made a sufficiently good impression for them to be considering returning there next year ! As for the Marriott, I would recommend it on a number of fronts. Firstly, location. We arrived to heavy snow - a wonderful way to arrive and very atmospheric at Christmas time, but a bit of a pain to navigate on foot. This is where the Marriott location excels - right in centre of Back Bay with easy access to T stations and connected to 2 malls - upscale Copley Place and the Prudential centre. This meant, despite the cold, we could shop & dine without the need for a coat. Our allocated rooms were on the 35th floor and we were lucky enough to be in a corner room - with fantastic views of the Prudential Tower, Hancock Tower, city and Charles river views. I'd recommend asking for a room on a high floor for this reason. There are also dedicated lifts for floors 27 and above, so we didn't encounter any of the delays reported in previous reviews. Previous reviews have commented on the quality of the beds and I absolutely agree. Boston's a fantastic city with lots to see and do, but it was difficult at times to leave the supreme comfort of the Marriott beds !!! Staff were also very friendly and professional and the breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was good, with a great eggs station. Only slight downside is that no special effort was made on Christmas day - the breakfast buffet was the normal fare with no variation and most of the hotel dining options closed for the day, so unless you wanted to spend Christmas Day in the (rather loud) Champions Sports Bar, you had to find alternatives. It wasn't a major issue for us - we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, a stroll through Boston Common and the Public Gardens, found a nice bar en-route back to hotel (Sola's), then headed to Legal Seafoods for Christmas dinner. In summary, I'd thoroughly recommend the Marriott Copley Place - it's a huge hotel, so it's unreasonable to expect personal service (in addition th the sheer size of the hotel, the fact that it's connected to 2 major malls, means it also gets a lot of through traffic), but that aside, the rooms are extremely comfortable, the facilities and staff great and the location is perfect - easy access to all the sights, the option of staying indoors if the weather is inclement and great sound insulation both from other rooms and outside.

We couldnt asked for more in the sense of services that were shown to us during our short stay. The room were big enough for 4 of us and the view from the 27th floor was breathtaking. We didnt request for a floor so high up but the lady at check in was more than happy to assign us to the 27th floor...that's\" walking and extra mile\" for the guest. Boston Marriott is located close to all major attractions. The duckboat tour was just acrossed from the hotel. The Boston City Trolley has a desk in the lobby and the hotel is one of its many stops. Now that's convenient ! Major shopping malls are walking distance and so as the many parks around Copley Place. Best in location,services and friendly staffs... as far as my family is concerned. Boston Marriott is TOP notch all the way ! We'll be back. One of our family members was interviewed by your Marketing Sales Manager name \"Brooke\" (hope Ive the right spelling) when we were waiting to board the DuckTour. I think he was very impressed with my sibling. My sibling did not only received not only 2 luggage tags but a t-shirt from TRIPADVISOR...that's was the highlight of our trip to Boston.

The lobby has only a small area for sitting around and the couches are so worn and old that you can see them sag even without anyone sitting in them! You know when you see an old couch that's been on a front porch exposed to weather - they have that look. Also everything looked kind of dirty, for instance in the elevators, they didn't vacuum the edges only the center, so the edges all looked dusty and there was old dirt. Just sloppy. We stayed at in a regular room for a few days and then a \"suite\" which is just an extra large room with a sitting area. We found an old grape, a bottle top and some old vegetable right in the middle of the floor - it obviously hadn't been vacuumed and that I would say sums up the way it felt. One had the feeling that instead of providing you with new water glasses and coffee mugs each day that they wiped out you used ones with one of your old towels and put it there as if it was clean. The furniture was okay but not great. The rooms appear to have been renovated within the last 10 years but it just didn't feel nice. Also the bathroom isn't really renovated, they saved money by leaving the bathtub area so it has an old bathtub and wall tiling from the 60s I guess, pretty depressing. Two pet peeves - they only give you 2 sugars and 2 creams for your in-room coffee maker which makes 4 cups, I can't imagine why they try to economize on such an insignificant detail when it makes one so annoyed. Also they ask for you only to put towels you need washed on the floor to save water etc but they don't give you any racks to put the towels on! The only towel rack is in the bathtub - hardly a practical place to put one's towel to stay dry when someone else will be taking a shower.

Our room was located on the 35th floor with a prime view of the Prudential Center and other buildings. Room was nicely appointed with new bedding. The bed was super comfy and the room was of good size. Bathroom was updated with a rainfall shower and larger size bottles of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash. The concierge floor is WONDERFUL. The lounge at 3pm when I went in to grab drinks had home made cookies, tea, coffee, and fresh fruit at that time. The selection of complimentary drinks was amazing. Diet pepsi, pepsi, ginger ale, Sierra Mist, bottled water, Red Bull, Snapple Green Iced Tea, and Snapple Diet lemon iced tea. Of course they had the honor bar open as well. When we went up at 6pm they had crab cakes, potato puffs, veggies with dip, crackers and cheese, and a few other things. The best part of that floor was the unbelievable view of the Charles River from the enormous windows. Beautiful. In the evening they were serving brownies, cookies, and truffles. It was a nice touch and more extensive than some of the other Marriott concierge floors in other properties that we have been to. We ordered room service for dinner and were happy with the food and the price. It wasn't too bad for a hotel in the city. Dinner with salads and soups ran us $60 with a dessert to share. It came within 35 minutes and was better than expected. There is a Shaws supermarket right directly across the street from this hotel. I ran over there to grab a few items that I had forgotten. If you are looking for snacks or drinks, buy them here and skip the gift shop. It is a very nice market with everything that you could want at a fraction of the price. This hotel is right at the entrance to the Shops at Copley Place, it is nice to be able to walk out into the mall with all the great shops and then head back to your room. Finally in the lobby there is a UPS business center that has internet access that costs $5/15 minutes along with other business services. My only complaint with this hotel is that the hallway on our floor was always dirty - dishes left outside the doors and they remained there for a while. Also, the valet charges $39 a day. I know that parking in Boston is expensive, but that seems a little steep, especially when there is no other option for parking. No self park in the garage or anything. Not a huge deal, but if you are not expecting it, then it can be a surprise. All in all, I would definitely stay here again. This was not my first time here and it won't be my last.

Nice linens and towels, overall the room was basic but very clean. Great insulation too, I never heard any noise at all and I was only on the 8th floor!

I was accidentally booked into a smoking room the first night and they told me that even though the hotel was sold out for the convention, they would try to move me to a non-smoking floor the next night, which amazingly enough they did. Minuses: don't eat at the hotel restaurants if you can avoid it. Not the worst food, but there are so many other places nearby that are great (Brassiere Jo just down the block is fantastic, there is a Smith and Wollensky walking distance if you want a great steak, Summer Shack is also walking distance for great lobster in a very fun and lowkey setting). As far as the location, I think this is a great spot if you like to shop, which I do. Copley Square Plaza has a Barney's and a bunch of other shops, but for the best high-end shopping experience you must go to Louis at the corner of Newbury Street and Berkeley. That place is the bomb!

Originally was going to stay at the Copley Park Plaza and it was suggested that hotel might not be so great for kids, and someone suggested the Sheraton near by with the outdoor pool. I booked the Sheraton, but then cancelled after reading too many poor reviews. Someone wrote they wished they'd gone down the road to the Marriot so I checked out those reveiws and all were positive, so I booked there. The hotel was easy to get to, with parking right there. We were early, 11am or so, and I left the luggage in the car thinking it was too early to check in, but no problem, they gave us keys to a room right away. The room was a reasonable size for a big city hotel, clean and modern, included a fridge with plenty of room to store supplies. The location was great, a half block or so from Copley Square, near the underground and attached to a huge Mall that we wondered around during the odd evening. It's a bit of a walk from the downtown area and the Freedom Trail, but we walked there several times, walked to the theatre etc. instead of taking the T, a pleasant and safe walk. Now this is not a small cosy hotel, it's one of those big city hotels, huge in fact, attached to the mall, so all sorts of people are wondering around the lobby area - not the type of hotel I'd normally choose. However, the staff were very helpful. The Trolley Tour has a stop right in front of the hotel, and you can buy tickets in the lobby, so that was handy. The concierge people were excellent - they had details and directions for everything. One gentleman in particular even knew which track on the T to take when switching trains on the subway. They also had nice little printed cards on driving routes out of town. One eveing when returning late and hoping to have a light dinner in the Sports Bar, we found that it was not open to children after 8pm. Neither was the Terrace Bar, and the restaurant looked a little boring for what we wanted. No problem, at the Terrace Bar they had a few tables outside the actual bar and offered us one of those, and treated us very well. There's also a sushi bar and a Starbucks in the lobby area. The hotel has an indoor pool and exercise room which we used a couple of times early in the morning or at the end of the day.

We wanted to be near some shopping and it definitely met our needs in this regard. In fact, given the current construction along the waterfront, this is really the best area to stay for tourists. We were a bit disappointed with the room. It was non-smoking, but the designation must have been in effect just for that day because it was definitely a smoker's room. The room itself was average. It was small, and the bathroom was small. This is not good for families who need to \"multi-task\" in the bathroom! My biggest complaint about the hotel was the fact that room service must have gone on strike when asked to clean up the dirty trays in the hallway. We checked in at about 5 p.m. and there were probably 10 different breakfast trays laying in the hallway. Scrambled eggs everywhere. It was terrible. We went out to dinner, came back late, and they were still there! Thankfully, they had been removed by the next morning. So to anyone who reads this, I like the Copley Place area, but would suggest a different hotel.", "Date": "August 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfasts\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3721229", "Content": "We had 4 nights in the Marriott.

Staff great from early check-in at the front desk to concierge, bellman, housekeep, and dining. Impressed with the super clean room and bathroom, as well as the neatness throughout the hotel! This is a property that has been kept up well. Very quiet room, despite size of hotel and on-going conventions. Room was a good size with awesome views of Boston and Charles River. You cannot beat the location with the subway, buses and commuter rail at the door. Plus you have 2 malls connected, Boylston/Newbury Streets, and a Shaws Market across the street. Beats even a stay at Faneuil Hall or the Ritz and Hyatt, as there is always somewhere to grab a bite, unlike Faneuil, when that closes, there is nothing available. Also walked 10 minutes to Fenway.

This is a quality, very large business type hotel in a nice part of the city. Note: it seems like every large hotel chain has an offering in this neighbourhood. Things I noticed: There is a full-size Shaw's grocery store right across the street - very convenient. My std. room was spotless with a very comfortable bed and quality linens. One thing I appreciated was the type of ice machine they use - it dispenses the ice much quieter than the ones I have seen before. Good news if your room is nearby. The hotel is part of a complex with a high-end shopping mall...

There is a swimming pool, gym etc on the fifth floor.

We had a great room with a great view (34th floor)! We arrived pretty late (well, 7pm) and didn't have much time to venture through the city, so we went downstairs to the Champions Sports Bar for dinner. Boy, was it crowded! The bar was showing the NYY-BoSox game, so it was full of energy. Because there were only 2 of us, we got seated pretty quickly. The drinks were expensive (but it is the city, so what should you expect? Cosmo was $7, beer $4.50). We loved the casual menu (cuz we're casual people). We ordered the nacho platter. The serving was so generous, it was enough for two and we didn't need dinner afterwards! I believe they cost $10, if memory serves me. The room was very spacious as well. See if they have a corner room available when you check in! The view we were afforded was specatular. The bathroom was simple, nothing fancy. Check-in and check-out were smooth as silk.

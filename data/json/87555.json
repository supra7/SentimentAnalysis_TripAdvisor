Everything about the hotel is disgusting. The \"maintenence guy\" walked around drinking a beer before the game, and when we returned, just as another guest noted, he ran up to us when we tried to enter our room and used his key to open it. He was clearly drunk. After calling every hotel in Champaign with no luck, we asked to switch rooms. The next room was somewhat better but we were still worried that there were bugs in our bed! The place should be torn down. If you have no other place to stay, I would suggest driving 40 miles to Decatur, or sleeping in your car.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cfit for the price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3102785", "Content": "I stayed for a couple of days , given the price and location I found the place a good bargain and they also have a lounge with live music on most weekends.The staff was helpful", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appletown, MD", "Title": "\u201cGood value for price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3026549", "Content": "We had a pleasant stay and the staff and service was very attentive.

Stayed here in May of 2004, as all of the other Champaign hotels were booked for graduation weekend. Rooms smelled moldy/mildewy. Whole place looks run down. Some rooms didn't have numbers posted. Fixtures have been painted over brass finish. Shower mat is caulked to the floor of the tub. Tub didn't drain very well at all. Stains on the carpet. Walls are painted-over wallpaper. Satellite dish on one of the exterior stairways, hooked up to nothing. Leave a deposit at the front desk if you'd like to have a phone in your room. Surprised they didn't have hourly rates.

At check in the room we originally had was terrible. The wallpaper was stained, dirty and pealing off the walls, there were holes in the walls and doors that had spackle slapped over them. The room was very dirty and had suspicious white stains on the carpet. The bathroom was completely stained a yellow color. We were forced to switched rooms since all other hotels were booked due to the Bears playing at U of I. The other room wasn't as bad but still next to terrible. The pool water wasn't anywhere next to clean or clear and the hallway floors were disgusting. Plus the staff was very rude. After coming back from the Bears game we found that are room key wasn't working anymore and the manager just came up and used his key to let us in our room. Once we were in we discovered that one of our credit cards were stollen. That isn't even all but by now you should deffinately know NOT to stay here.", "Date": "August 11, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Premier Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d87555-Reviews-Premier_Inn-Champaign_Illinois.html", "Price": "$40 - $105*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1505 North Neil Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Champaign</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">61820</span></span> (Formerly Howard Johnson)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87555", "ImgURL": ""}}

Pike's Market, shopping, and dining are easily within walking distance and the bus and light rail easily accessible within a couple of blocks. Great location. The rooms are large and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is small but there is a nice walk in shower and make up mirror with good lighting. The suites have a cushy sofa that pulls out to a comfortable bed. The lobby is warm and welcoming. I appreciated the fireplace coming in from the cold weather. Our check in was delayed due to linen arriving late which was disappointing after a long flight. We were finally given keys to a room that other guests were clearly occupying. The staff was quick to get us to another room and get us settled in. The front desk staff was very friendly, helpful, and efficient, however, two of the doorman were often too busy talking to actually open the door. Internet connection is not free.

We had a great experience at the hotel and in Seattle! We stayed 3 nights in a Luxe Suite and feel like, compared to \"normal\" prices for a downtown hotel room, we got a good deal at $169 per night. Andra is close to EVERYTHING downtown. It's an easy 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, 2 blocks to Westlake Center for shopping, and there are outstanding restaurants all over the place. You can also take the monorail from Westlake for a 5 minute trip to the Space Needle and the EMP. The Sea-Tac train is across the street from Westlake as well so you can take it from the airport and back if you don't mind taking your luggage two blocks. We had carry-ons so it wasn't a big deal. You don't need a car here! Everything is close! :) We were met by the front desk employees for check-in and it went very smoothly. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area and the city. They also did things little things for you like hit the \"down\" button on the elevator for you as you walked down the hall if they happened to be standing close by. The lobby is great for sitting and visiting with friends or colleagues with nice furniture and a fireplace. There is easy access off the lobby to the bar area as well. The place is decorated beautifully with contemporary furnishings. The room was a typical two-room suite with a living area and separate bedroom with a french door entry. There was a couple of flat screen TVs and a desk for work if you need it. My wife liked the sitting area for putting on make-up, and that was needed considering the bathroom was a little on the small side. This is normal for older hotels that have been remodeled and it wasn't an issue. The entire room was roomy, and comfortable. There was ZERO wear and tear on this place. The upkeep seems to be really good and they take great care in making the place very clean. It's even nicer than it looks in the photos. My wife commented that it \"looks better than the web site\". The turn down service was great too as they put on nice music and leave delicious dark chocolates. Restaurants: Eat at Lola in the lobby! Great eggs benedict! Across the street is Dahlia Lounge which was good. Serious Pie (pizza) is across the street on Virginia Street and is SERIOUSLY good. We had it twice! Ralph's Grocery is at the end of the block on 4th Street take a right out of the lobby and it's on the corner. They have a really good wine selection, groceries, food, etc. I was actually really surprised how nice it was inside. Of course, go the the market on the water, and don't miss Etta's for AMAZING crab benedict and Cafe Campagne for some of the best French food I've ever had!

The hotel admits that it has a security video of a professional thief stealing my bag off its bellhop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luggage cart, but it will not compensate me. The wonderful consumer advocate Chris Elliott investigated and confirmed my version of the incident, and you can read his blog about it at his website, [--] for all the details. Now I am just getting the word out to everyone else. So the short version of events is that back in August, the bellhop unloaded my things from the rental car onto a cart, whisked it away, and as it turns out, parked it in the lobby. When the luggage came to the room later, my backpack (including eyeglasses and medicine) was missing. Only after I yelled at the people at the front desk did the hotel review its security tapes and sure enough, a week after we left, it confirmed that a man is seen on the tape stealing my bag. The hotel said he looked like a professional, but the hotel never even bothered to call the police. Meanwhile, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insurance company denied coverage because the bellhop was so stupid as to leave the bag unattended in the lobby, a public space. The only correct response from the hotel should have been, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are so sorry. How can we fix this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nope. Instead, a month after the incident, I was told that the clerk behind the counter says she offered to move my luggage to a more secure location. That is total nonsense. Why would I possibly refuse such an offer if it ever had been made? The same clerk also said she tried to call my husband on his cell while he was returning the rental car. Of course, there is no cell record of this because she never actually did that. So the director of rooms refunded the first night of our hotel stay when we checked out because the hotel had given me the runaround and treated me so poorly while I was there. The manager later refunded our second night, while specifically denying the hotel was responsible. How could it not be?! And the refund covers only half the value of the bag.

Rooms were up to date in decor and in technology and tastefully done. The bathroom is kind of small, but still nicely redone. Free Wi-Fi if you ask. My only pet peeve -- when we asked for a taxi to be called, we were told that their car service was about the same price as a taxi. Believing what they said was true, we climbed right in. They gave us a business card to call for a return pick up. Since a taxi was already available when we were ready to go back, it made more sense to take the taxi than wait for the hotel car. Much to our surprise, the cost of the taxi cab ride back to the hotel was LESS than HALF the ride back WITH tip. That was not cool.

We booked the Northern Neighbours Package that included free internet and 50% off parking and a complimentary room grade upon arrival. Before leaving home I decided I wanted to guarantee the suite, so I emailed the hotel and asked to be moved into a Suite, the told me there were not any available. So I checked Hotels.ca and there were suites showing as available. I phoned the Hotel and was told that there were suites, so upgrade my reservation. Then later that same day I received and email saying there had been cancellations so a suite was available (this email from the person that had earlier said there were no suites until I asked via email why Hotels.ca was showing them). So all that was a bit confusing for me. In the end we got the suite as a complimentary upgrade for the misunderstanding and miscommunication. First, I love small boutique hotels, I am not a fan of mega hotels. I loved the lobby and the design. I loved the furnishings in the rooms, a mix of contemporary decor within a historic building. One issue though was the lighting in the room was horrible. I could not see in the closet, I could not see in the dresser and had to feel around for my clothes, even with the lights all turned on and the drapes open. The bathroom was surprisingly small considering the size of the rest of the suite. We had also asked for housekeeping to put the pull our sofa away during the day and make it up again at night for our daughter. This never happened as requested. We also arrived back one afternoon at 4:00 to find the room still had not been cleaned for the day. This was quite disappointing. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and treated my daughter with respect and kindness. The location was great for walking pretty much everywhere. The TV in the elevator - they have to go.... I don't watch TV and I don't allow my daughter to watch TV so I am very disturbed when I see TVs in public spaces where I have no control over what she sees. And even if I was not traveling with her , I don't want to be bombarded by marketing and the negativity on the news in every public space I visit.

The room was partitioned into a living room and bedroom, creating an almost apartment-like atmosphere. The living quarters was of a very modern decor, consisting of a glass coffee table, glass desk, orange ottoman, funky rug, and suspended flat-screen. The sleeping quarters were equally appealing, as it had two sets of blue lights draped along the bed's headboard. Overall, the room felt new and fresh. The amenities were very sufficient. The shower actually had three dispensers fixed on the wall: luxury soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Perhaps one of the biggest letdowns, however, was the fact that there was no bathtub. One would expect to find a tub in such a serene and romantic atmosphere. The lobby is just fascinating, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. One of the housekeepers mistook my champagne glass for the hotel's and took it along with the rest of my leftover room service. Needless to say, it was literally returned within minutes of my calling the front desk. I highly recommend this place.

Downsides were many. the bed was so bad, there was a huge dip in the middle where literally, you had to either hover on the edge of the bed or roll into the big hole in the middle. My husband and I had the worst sleep ever. We complained, no change, no reply. Ditto about the shower. It did not drain. About three minutes into your shower and you are standing in ankle deep water. That to me, is disgusting. We asked three times for a plumber to fix it. No luck. It remained that way for our entire stay. Room service only has Greek food on the menu. It was from Lola's.

It's fashionable but it's more trying than executing on the urban chic measure. The location is pretty good - just a short distance to all the fun in Pike's Place, shopping on Fifth Ave, and tourist entertainment near the Space Needle. It's also right on the edge of some dodgy blocks and alleys too - I had the opportunity to breath in urine, pot, BO and garbage on the several short walks I made to the nearby attractions. My room was spacious, modern, clean and comfortable. The hotel is about 9 stories high (the exterior, by the way, is nothing special) and many of the rooms are on the busy streets, but the city traffic noise is muffled. The king bed was great and there was a small fridge and sink as well as an office desk space and small couch with coffee table. If you like a bathtub, you don't get one. Also, there's no shower door or curtain, just a partial glass covering, which I think is chilly! The bathroom generally was small and the lighting on the moody side - flattering, but difficult for applying makeup. I'd say the room is nice, the bathroom just average. The Lola restaurant in the lobby serves up great Mediterranean food and you can get it to go for your room if you like. I give the 4 rating because I didn't think it quite hit the mark on the hipness, location is good but near some seedy stuff and the bathroom was average. A few other things that make it fall a little short - the service is funny (there's plenty of help but they don't necessarily get the door or offer to deliver your luggage) and the details were missed (eg my ironing board legs were smashed and broken; my toiletries and coffee supplies weren't refilled; I had to call at 2pm to get my room cleaned).

The warmth and friendliness starts the moment you pull your vehicle up to the front door, from the valets to the front desk reception. The front waiting area of the hotel is understated elegance and simple but yet exudes much comfort. The understated elegance and simplicity is carried forth in the rooms and overall in the hotel. We got a great hotel rate and stayed in the king suite, which was a comfortable size room. While it was a hotel room, it did not feel like a hotel room. It felt more like a comfortable personal space that one might have in their own home. But the wonderfulness of Hotel Andra does not stop there. Attached to the hotel is a place called Lola's, owned by a renowned Seattle chef. My husband and I had a drink there the afternoon we checked in and breakfast the following day. Both times, the service and food was impeccable and delicious! (I highly recommend the made-to-order donuts!) Location wise, Hotel Andra was a perfect spot for one wanting to close to downtown venues and activities. We were within walking distance to the 5th Avenue Theatre, Pike's Market, close to all the main shopping downtown and a whole lot more. It was actually really nice that we didn't have to drive around to different places. (Oh, and did I mention about a little bakery across from the hotel, the Dahlia Bakery? Delicious breads and \"I'm in Tropical Paradise\" triple coconut cream pies??) The only negative about the whole experience is that I can't find any negatives! (not that I am looking but usually there are always some...) So, there you have it. Hotel Andra is that little piece of heaven in Seattle! We can't wait for our next stay and outing at Hotel Andra/downtown Seattle!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSmart, comfortable hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Shellsf", "ReviewID": "UR117297585", "Content": "Desk staff was friendly, the contemporary decor was attractive and functional,and the beds were comfortable.

After quickly describing what type of food we where looking for he pointed us to an amazing little restaurant. He was so friendly we immediately felt good about our choice of hotel. After lunch we wandered back and check in was quick and painless. Our room was clean and modern. Layout was much nicer than your standard hotel. Robes where very comfortable. My only complaint is that some light is let into the sleeping area of the room at night. The lights in the hall are very bright and shine in all around the door. We had to lay a towel down to block most of it out. We also could not find a way to turn off the under-shelve lighting in the bathroom, so if the bathroom door slid open the room was bathed in a blue light. That being said, we slept great, the bed and linens are so comfortable! Check out is at 1:00, and that gave us plenty of time to have breakfast and explore pike market and the aquarium before we needed to be out. Check out was just as easy as check in.

We called the desk & were told they would bring up keys for a different room. The 1st room faced the back & definitely had a rather cold, un-welcoming feel to it. The bedspread had a stain right in the center. The 2nd room faced the street & was far more welcoming & comfortable. The street is noisier, but we prefer that to looking out on brick walls & industrial roof tops. The bed was exquisitely comfortable & the towels & linens wonderful. I loved the down pillows & comforter, & the warm, comfy bathrobe, & I enjoyed a power nap under the soft, extra blanket. Rather modern styled furnishings in a classicly styled room & it worked. Nice little bar area & bags of ice at the elevators fit right into the ice bucket. The downside -- the small bathroom. The toilet barely flushed. The sink tilted the wrong direction so the water would not drain out of it. Pretty yucky. Watch your elbows when sitting on the toilet -- a bit cramped. Lola's bar & restaurant is trendy with a nice atmosphere, good drinks, fun place. We didn't eat there -- we walked accross the street to one of my favorite haunts, The Dahlia Lounge. But we did have a bite off the bar menu -- lamb kabobs & pita with cauliflower & anchovy spread. I wouldn't do that again. The lamb was very tough & chewy & the \"carmelized onions\" were barely warm. The pita triangles were good, as was the spread, but there was not a hint of anchovy in it, and that's a taste that's pretty hard to hide. We had a great weekend escape & a very comfortable nights sleep, so if this is what you're looking for, Hotel Andra will fill the bill nicely. If you're looking for something really amazing & over the top, I'd look elsewhere.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn", "Title": "\u201cI surprised my wife with a getaway here and now I am up for husband of the year!\u201d", "Author": "RCskier", "ReviewID": "UR54932624", "Content": "My wife and I had a wonderful time, the staff were helpful and the rooms were nicely appointed, comfortible and clean.

Huge bed, writing/pantry area, huge walk-in closet, and beautiful bathroom that kept the historic features, but had all the latest updates. I especially liked the \"dimmable\" lamp they had in the bathroom, as well as the architectural features. There was a large flat screen TV, and wide full length mirror. The windows opened completely, if that's what you want...I was awakened the next morning to the birds singing in the trees right outside my window on 4th Avenue! That street is relatively quiet at night, so ask to face front. I didn't have time to sample the lounge, and restaurant, but they looked interesting and active.

The concierge was always there and helpful with my questions. The location is just fantastic, I was able to shop and drop stuff off at my room, and then go back out again. Westlake center is a few blocks away, with connections to the bus, light rail, and the Monorail out to Seattle Center. There's a Bed Bath and Beyond just across the street that has most anything a traveler could want. And you can spend a whole day shopping around Westlake and Pacific center - lots of nice shops and restaurants. Just past the Westin on 5th Avenue, there's a street car - http://www.seattlestreetcar.org that takes you out to a beautiful lake with a whole complex of shops and beautiful restaurants - It's a great way to get away from the tourist traps downtown, and see where the locals go..Get off at Lake Union Park station.

One concern was that the doors between the two rooms of the suite are not solid, they are open slats. So if you are in one room and want to watch the TV while someone in the other room is sleeping, the sound gets through. Unfortunately, I've found most suites are like this these days. The room was new and nicely decorated. Rooms size is decent, and the closet is huge -- like small walk in room. Hotel seems well built and the rooms are quiet. The main bed was great. The fold out bed was not so good. Very saggy. An adult might not be happy with it, but the two children were fine. Valet parking is available. Not cheap, but about the same price as it costs to self-park in Downtown Seattle so a good deal. One concern we had was that the windows could be opened all the way. This was a huge worry for us since the hotel is on the 8th floor. We watch the boys but you never know -- and it is a LONG way down. The air conditioning works well so we did not need to open them. I mentioned this to the front desk, not expecting anything to come of it. But, surprisingly, the next day a guy came to our room and attached some brackets to the windows which blocked them from opening at all. He said the manager had sent him, and that he would come back after we left and take the brackets off. This just blew me away.

The $60 oxygen bottle, an option like a water bottle \"to revitalize you\" is purely ridiculous, as is the extra small Voss water by the bed.

But W hotels are understaffed with jaded 20 year olds, all the halls are unforgivingly dark, and the Voss water is $10 (but it comes in the glass bottle.) So there the comparison ends. Hotel Andra is what W Hotels should be. Period. So what was bad? The valet lot must be a city away as it routinely took 10 - 15 minutes to get the car. $35 a night for that honor didn't help.

Nice! At any rate, the hotel was an old building that had been beautifully remodeled. It was very mod. Our room was gorgeous. The bathroom was small but you could tell exactly what it must have looked like \"back in the day.\" In other words, they had kept the character of the room, and this was most evident in the bathroom, where the totally new & modern fixtures were updated versions of the fixtures that were likely there in the hotel's original heyday.

Our bed was very comfortable, there was a nice flat panel TV in the room, and the bathtub was huge, I am So happy I indulged in a bath before I left. The shampoo and other products were from a company called Face and they were White Tea fragrance. They smelled so good I wish I knew where to buy them. The view from our window was unfortunately pretty crappy because the building across the street was under construction. I would imagine that this will be a really cool view once it is done. But I don't spend much time looking out the window when I'm in a hotel anyway. :) The location was EXCELLENT. The hotel is located on 4th avenue- we were planning to see a show at Demetrious Jazz Alley on Saturday night for my birthday. This venue is on 6th avenue- as it turned out, we were in Easy walking distance of the show. Just a couple blocks. Perfect. We also met up with my husband's cousin Saturday afternoon at a place called Brasa- also just a few blocks away. This was a lounge that offered delicious food & drink. Great place to hang out and chat. Attached to the hotel is a retaurant called Lola. We went there for brunch when we got into town and for a cocktail after the show. The food at this place is Amazing- Greek-inspired cuisine by chef Tom Douglas. When our friends found out we were staying at the Andra, they demanded that we go to Lola, and we are damn glad we did. Also, the hotel is located across the street from the famous Dahlia Lounge, which is also a Tom Douglas restaurant. However, we did not have time to check it out. Regarding service: I had received a birthday gift of champagne, and the manager on duty (Kyle) called me to let me know. I appreciated that he called in the afternoon well after we had settled in even though he already knew about the gift when I got there. He asked when a good time would be to bring up the gift, and I said anytime. He said he would chill it first then bring it up in about 45 minutes. At precisely then, he arrived. When he got to the door, he asked if I wanted him to come in to set down the package. (Now, this may seem like an obvious question, BUT the last time we stayed somewhere, we ordered room service, and when it arrived, the guy literally just walked right in without asking! I was sitting there in my underwear, so it was really embarrassing.) Anyway, Kyle set down the package, wished me a happy birthday and was on his way. He was just a cool cat all around and a class act. In fact, I can say that Everyone we encountered at the Hotel Andra was very attentive, nice, friendly, and helpful. When we checked out on Sunday, they were pretty busy, but our car was brought promptly by the young valet, who asked us if we needed any directions. We actually did, and he provided very helpful directions for us. He was so nice and genuine that we talked about him when we got in the car and joked that it would be nice to have a son like that instead of the ones we do have. ha! I would highly recommend the Hotel Andra. As the construction around the hotel gets completed, I think this hotel is only going to become more desirable. I think we got an amazing deal, and I only wish our visit was longer- next time it will be!", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cVery chic, very comfortable\u201d", "Author": "s_w_on_the_road", "ReviewID": "UR27214839", "Content": "Excellent location, excellent rooms, excellent area to sit in entrance.

Overall, we were satisfied with our stay, as we got a deep discount, but I'm left wondering how or why they are listed with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. We had a Lux King corner suite, and the suite itself is quite spacious, and very quiet, we did have a restful sleep. Beds/linens were soft and comfortable, and they brought up extra pillows as requested. There was plenty of storage in our suite -- 2 closets and a set of drawers, plus the generously-sized night tables were a plus. However, the sofa was disappointing -- of cheap construction, and sagging in the middle; fairly uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv. The armchair seriously needed recovering, as the edges were worn, dirty and frayed. The suite is due for an overhaul soon; we noticed chipped paint throughout, plus chipped and scratched furniture. The carpets felt a bit grimy -- there was an overall feeling that the room could have been cleaner. The bathroom is small (I knew this going in, having read past reviews). This did not bother me much, as there were adequate shelves and storage. However, if you like soaking in the tub, forget it. The tub has a very low overflow drain, obviously designed by someone who hates baths. I'm 5'2\" and not very big -- the maximum water level came up to my lower abdomen. As I reclined trying to soak, the water kept draining off, and I gave up after about 5 minutes. Shower pressure is good and tons of hot water any time of the day. The Face Stockholm amenities are a delicious subtle white tea fragrance; however the bottles are the size of postage stamps, which seems cheap for a \"luxury\" hotel. The staff are happy to send up more, but it was tiring to request this on a daily basis. The staff were mostly 20-30 somethings and very pleasant and eager to please. However, I still feel they have not achieved a \"luxury\" level of service. We had a simple request that we be sent a Seattle Times, v. a New York times as we like to read local news. On a daily basis we received a New York times, which to give them credit, was swiftly replaced with a Seattle Times on request, but we shouldn't have had to keep asking for 4 days in a row. Another time we asked a desk person to reconfirm a reservation (the concierge had left) and he looked at us like we handed him a dead fish. It may seem that I'm nitpicking, but I would expect this from maybe a Motel 6 v. a \"luxury\" hotel. I would actually place the Andra slightly above a 3 star hotel, not at a \"luxury\" level. The staff for the most part, are accomodating and pleasant, and the room was ok. We would stay again if we got the same low rate; however, we would not stay if we had to pay the high season rate of approx $480.00 -- we felt the service and room would not be worth it.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jackson, ms", "Title": "\u201cokay....not amazing...and they lost my bags.\u201d", "Author": "nedo134", "ReviewID": "UR21981805", "Content": "Stayed here for a friend's wedding.

In planning for the trip, Hotel Andra was at the top of a short list of hotels, and we booked directly with them. The room we booked was a standard Andra Room with a King-size bed. In general, everything was pretty good to great -- you can see the various reviews that cover the modern, clean decor, helpful (usually) staff, and great location. So, let me get the negatives out of the way first. The bathroom was a little dirty -- some mildew on the tiles. Not much, but for a 4-star hotel, I figured that would be covered. Also, a feature Hotel Andra offers is your choice of free paper every morning. I asked 4 separate times for the Wall Street Journal to be delivered to the room, but only received it once out of 7 days at Andra. I even watched as the various staff and managers scribbled it down on paper to make the change. It didn't happen. I see on their website this feature has now been limited to just the Seattle Times or the New York Times. The street noise is a little loud -- I requested a high floor (which they graciously obliged), and was on the 9th floor out of 10 total. I thought the first night that the windows were open for all the street noise (engines, sirens, etc.). The wireless internet was a real pain to set up -- it's essentially a T-Mobile hotspot, so you have to pay an extra $10 a day. The front desk was no help when we asked about it though -- they just told us to call T-Mobile. Now for the good stuff -- I love modern decor, and Hotel Andra definitely has it. Everything is function-oriented, but still very comfortable and easy to use. Outside of the mildew, the room was very clean -- no carpet stains, clean sheets, no trash, dust, etc. The granite-topped bar in the room was a nice addition and the sink came in very handy when the other was being used. And, of course the FACE toiletries were nice for my wife (although we both brought our own anyway). The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. It was a fantastic point to start off each day to a new part of the city and beyond. And, outside the points mentioned above, the staff overall was fantastic, helping us at every point -- housekeeping was very responsive and courteous, the doormen were always able to help, the concierge and front desk gave us great ideas where to get pizza, and more. I'd definitely recommend Hotel Andra if a modern, convenient, boutique hotel is in your plans.

I have never checked out of a hotel early in my many years of travel. I booked a room at the Hotel Andra almost 6 months before we went to Seattle. I booked directly through their website for a room described as \"2 Queens or 1 King\". I made a note in the reservation that I wanted the 1 King, as I was going with my boyfriend. When I got my confirmation via email, it said \"2 Queens\" but the note was on there about the 1 King, so I didn't worry about it. When we arrived, I verified with the front desk agent that we were indeed getting 1 King, not 2 Queens. He said only the 2 Queens room was available. Obviously, we did not want to spend our vacation time sleeping in separate beds. The only thing available with 1 bed was a Queen. In other words, we were downgraded. There was no offer made to lower our rate, though. I blew it off at first because we had received a great rate anyway. After we spent one night in the room, we were both miserable and grumpy with each other. The queen bed was just way too tiny after being used to a King at home, and the room itself was also incredibly small. The bathroom was hardly big enough to turn around in. And our view? Construction and another apartment building. I complained to a manager, who said they were completely booked so there was nothing he could do. We went back to our room, looked online, and were able to book a much nicer room beginning the next day (we were in town for 5 nights). I told the manager I was going to check out the next day. He told me I'd have to pay a $75 cancellation fee! When I balked, he said he'd have to talk to the reservation manager to get that waived, and he'd call me in the morning. We checked out and I told the woman at the front desk that I did not want to be charged the fee. She said ok, and didn't charge me. So, this was the only positive part of the experience. The reservation manager never called me. Aside from all this, I still wouldn't have liked this place- the neighborhood is really sketchy, even though there's a bunch of nice restaurants. We got asked for money every time we walked out of the hotel.

The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures. And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep. The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small but never had a problem getting in for late drinks. The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away. Lola onsite is good, but the Dahlia Lounge directly opposite is fantastic.

I prefer something that offers a distinct personality but also a calming sense of familiarity. That said, I hereby declare that the Hotel Andra in Seattle is the Tina Fey of the hospitality industry - alluring and cool and quirky and fun, all rolled into one. It's a rare find that offers exceptional design, ample space, distinct character, and stellar customer service. I came across the Andra via my secret weapon, aka my friend Steve who just happens to work for the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau. With a prime location in the heart of Seattle's Belltown area and moderate price range (under $200/night), I knew we were off to a good start, and after poking around their website, the vibe and decor seemed like the right match too. I was instantly drawn in by the sleek lighting, clean lines, and tasteful color palette of muted blues, greys, and taupes, with touches of Scandanvian inspiration. The Andra was our last stop during our recent honeymoon vacation, and prior to checking in, I had just made my detour to Cupcake Royale. So as I approached the reception desk with a box of treats in hand, in lieu of the standard welcome, the person behind the counter launched into a bit about how nice it was for me to bring him cupcakes. I played right along - I love it when people loosen up and goof around like that, especially people who work in the higher end of the hospitality world, where more often than not you'll encounter some pretty stiff attitudes. The front desk staff seemed to think they were in a improv group, with me as their special guest star, so score one for the Andra. Score two was finding out upon check in that we'd been upgraded to a suite (thanks to the little Upgrade Fairy, also known as my friend Steve who had put in a call to the manager). Also, the timing couldn't have been better in terms of being granted additional space - we'd accumulated a lot of goodies over the past week, and found ourselves in a serious repacking situation, which meant needing some room to spread out. Wish granted: a corner suite with a spacious living room area that included a flatscreen TV, giant desk, and full length mirror, along with another flatscreen TV in the separate bedroom. The bathroom was also really cute and stylish, and the stash of Face Stockholm products made me a very happy girl.

The location couldn't be better. The first night we were there, we stayed in the Andra Suite. The room was moderately spacious and well designed. The mini-bar was well stocked, but a price list was no where to be found. Room service was from Lola the restaurant in the lobby. The food was very good, and the prices were very high. Overall we had a great experience. We unexpectedly decided to stay at the hotel a second night. After our great experience the first night, we decided to save some money and get the smaller Andra Studio because we didn't think we'd mind a simple size change, we expected everything else to be of the same quality. I can tell you the room size was pretty much the only physical change, but the service the second night didn't reflect it's four star rating. First, the window didn't open. Now this isn't a big deal to us, but when we called the front desk to see if there was a trick to getting the window open (because the windows in the suite opened), the gentleman told us that it doesn't open because of fire code, and all the windows on that floor were sealed shut. I know that's not true because we had stayed on the same floor the night before. We didn't appreciate being lied to. Next, we went to turn on the TV. It didn't work. We checked the plug, it was fine. We called the front desk. They said they'd send someone up to check on it. Forty-five minutes later, a girl from the front desk arrived, announced that maintenance was unavailable and that she was going to check it out. She walked over to the TV, pressed the same power button we had tried and checked the same plug we had checked (just like we told her on the phone). After she was unsuccessful, she told us that she didn't know what was going on, and that she'd try to find maintenance. Another twenty minutes go by, and she calls to tell us that eminence wasn't working and wouldn't be until morning. I told her that was unacceptable because we had plans to stay in for the remainder of the night and were going to watch TV. I requested a new room with a working TV. She told me there were no rooms available and that we'd just have to wait until eminence arrived. I explained that I found it hard to believe that they were sold out all of a sudden, considering we had checked in two hours earlier and they had all kinds of other room options available (including the suite we had stayed in the night before and the mid-range Andra Room). She then told me she'd have to call me back. They ended up moving us and the new room was just across the hall, the Andra Room (and by the way, the windows opened in it, too). This was the second lie of the night. In the morning, we hit the valet key on the phone, to request our car. The front desk answered and said that she'd be happy to have the valet pull the car. We waited ten minutes and walked downstairs (that's about how long it had taken them the day before). When we got down there, there were two valets standing around having a personal conversation. After we stood there for ten minutes, holding the blue valet ticket and tip money in my hand, one of them comes over and asked if we needed our car. I explained that we had called and the front desk said they were going to call out and request the car. He said they hadn't and it didn't surprise him because \"it had already happened a few times that morning\". All in all, I can't say much bad about the hotel, the rooms or the restaurant. I don't mind little things like the window not opening or having to change rooms because the TV doesn't work.

Daily paper - offerred choice of NY or Seattle Times - chose Seattle Times for local content and news. Received NY Times - every day! Six complaints (I was there 7 nights) but never did receive the right paper... Room was in good condition though housekeeping erratic. Bathroom small but adequate, but would look much better if the stained and worn tile floor was replaced. Food Smells - every now and then, usually late afternoon, but the A/C (noisy but very efficient) seemed to take care of it easily. Traffic noise - yes (I was on 3rd floor) but not particularly loud. Didn't bother me. Restaurant - did not try Lola's (but friends who did liked it). Assiago's next door very good. Bakery across the street (Dahlia) a great place for breakfast goodies. This hotel is certainly on my list for a great place to stay in Seattle.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely Room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3725261", "Content": "Hi, We stayed here as the Second part of our honeymoon, prevously at the Hotel Omni in San fransico.

The hotel lobby, bar and rooms are decorated in a hip, modern, yet welcoming, Scandanavian style. The bar/restaurant is a happening place, spilling over into the lobby at night with stylish, mostly young people drinking and talking. Quiet, though; no boorish behavior. Our party booked both a suite at $299/night and a double at $159/night. Suites are indeed two separate rooms, as advertized, but don't expect a lot of privacy as the door between the rooms is louvered. Still, if your group is a family or merely good friends, there is an adequate degree of separateness. Rooms are a comfortable size, very clean, well-furnished and without noticeable wear and tear, although the bathrooms are a bit small. The beds are super-comfortable and guests are provided with a great number of spa-type towels. Flat-screen TV in the rooms, too. The business center is small; one desk-top computer and one printer which did not work during part of our stay. Online e-mail is free, however, and there's another desktop in the lobby for use by guests. The entire hotel is WI-FI, $10.00 per day. As they say in real estate, the best part of the hotel is location, location, location. It's three blocks to major shopping, four blocks to Pike Place Market, and many great restaurants are within walking, too. Also, there's a Ralph's on the corner and, 40 yards away, the Airporter Connector bus ($17 roundtrip compared to $56 for a taxi) picks up and drops off every 30 minutes or so. The monorail to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project is only a few blocks away, too. I recommend Hotel Andra without reservation.....Ooops, maybe that's with reservation.

I speak of the the kind of toss-off of thrift-store-potpourri or the hyper-self-consciously modern style featuring austere curved shapes of polished metal. But the work done on the Hotel Andra truly impressed me. The choices made in design were, to my eye, very intelligent and finely tuned. The first thing that stood out to me was the choice of carpeting in the halls. The usual flavor of mass produced homogenous pattern that screams volume discount above all else in most places (even luxury hotels) is abandoned for a dark purple field with modest framing lines on the margins. In addition the monotony of most hallways is broken up by a few subtle, long, thin, curved shapes along one margin. The subtlety of the lines, like modest scrollwork, that eschew the mundane and base inclination of symmetry achieves an effect that is stimulating but far from overbearing. For the weary traveler who may not have the energy to actively appreciate the other appointments this touch is quite uplifting. The rest of the build is a great succcess in reclaiming an aging building with modern design. Along the center of corridor ceilings a section of perforated brushed sheet metal reveals only to close inspection the space that holds pipes and conduit as well as overhead halogen lighting. It is a laudable design statement that refuses to simply veneer over the old with the typical staple-on finishings that are the hallmark of mass-market remodeling. The rooms blend the old building with tasteful understated elegance of modern furnishings. The bedding is lush and generous in pillows and blanketing. The bathroom was nicely reclaimed from the buildingd previous exixtence with modern fixtures that emulated the old, like a new pedestal basin. This choice leaves only a shelf along walll over the sink and a pedestal side stand for personal effects which might create a space shortage for travelers with a lot of personal hygiene and cosmetics. The old floor that was the familiar 1 inch hexagonal tiles was reclaimed by sanding down the old surface. This effect was obviously efficacious but, not my favorite technique. The random fade of the original borders of the hexagons seemed too haphazard. I would have looked for some other treatment in addition to liven up the old floor but this is a minor criticism. The overall effect inspires me to say \"Kudos\".

Unfortunately, my stay did not live up to the hype. Things started off bad right off the bat due to the awful valet parking situation at this hotel. The valet parking attendants were not to be found so we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to show up and give us a claim ticket. Throughout the three days we spent there, the valet parking situation was a constant hassle. Sometimes no one was there; sometimes there was no space in front of the hotel to drop off the car because limos and other cars were parked there for the adjacent restaurants; sometimes even when someone was there it took them over 15 minutes to get the car brought around (and this was after calling them from the room ahead of time to have the car brought around). We discovered that the hotel is contracting this service out and will not be providing valet parking service on its own until the beginning of next year. This was a really annoying aspect of the hotel. We tried to check in at 3 p.m. Mind you, we had called ahead of time since we were out shopping and asked if the room would be ready at 3 p.m. and we were assured that it would be. We got to the hotel at 3:15 p.m. and sure enough, the room was not ready. It was not ready for another 30 minutes. The front desk staff was aloof, unhelpful and lacking in social skills. There was only one front desk employee during the course of the three days that actually seemed like he enjoyed helping the clientele. The rest just sat there chatting with each other and barely looked up when anyone passed by. One night we discovered that the valet parking attedant was not outside to take our car because he was inside chatting and laughing with the two girls at the front desk. Needless to say, I was not amused. The previous comments about the hotel smelling like onion is absolutely. . .TRUE. At night when the restaurant in the lobby gets cooking, you will smell onions throughout the hotel. We were on the NINTH floor and we smelled it in the hallways up there. Luckily, the smell did not travel into our room, but every time we walked through the lobby I thought I was going to hurl. It was that strong. Perhaps the front desk people at night were so much like zombies because they had to inhale that awful stench all night long. As far as the room goes, I was very unimpressed. The bathroom was tiny and very hard to get around. The bath products were average at best. I decided to use my own that I had brought from home, and I almost never do that. To their credit, the bed was extremely comfortable. The pillows could have been fluffier though. We had a junior suite, so we had some extra space. There was a couch, coffee table and a small bar area in the living portion of the room. The room had absolutely no view, so we did not spend much time in the room at all. The air conditioning worked well, so that was a saving grace for the room. The location is very good. It is central to shopping and the sights. Personally, I prefer to stay closer to the shops. I definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Elliott Bay as a wonderful 5-star hotel with impeccable rooms, service and location. The Hotel Andra was very disappointing. I kept trying to be optimistic and find positive things about the experience. But, quite frankly, there were very few things about my stay there that leave happy memories. I would definitely never stay at this hotel again. I just can't express how truly disappointed I am.

I must say, I left being a little obsessed with the place. 1. I was upgraded to the suite, which of course is just a larger room with a couch. However, it was a very snazzy couch. I asked to see a regular room so I would be able to see what I paid for. It was a standard size room, but... 2. The blue and beige Scandanavian-inspired color scheme is quite striking. I understand that in five years it will need to be redone or it will look both dated and frayed, but for now it is a cut above similarly priced entries. 3. Fascinated by other problems with restaurant smells, I am almost disappointed to say I had no such problems. However, I did have breakfast at Lola. Expensive, but delicious. No octopus for me, but the smashed potatoes were scrumptuous. 4. I cannot abide a hotel that doesn't have a computer room with free acccess. The Lola provides. There is also a workout room. It's small, but I overheard a staff member saying they are planning to move it to a larger space. 5. My local friend told me they pumped a ton of money into this and it shows.

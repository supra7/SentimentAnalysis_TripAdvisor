After a long day at DISNEY, we checked in at 10\"30 pm. First off, we did not get connecting rooms but had two rooms next to each other, which was fine. However, when we pulled the bedspread and blanket down on one of the children's beds, it had glitter and lint all over it. I called the front dest at11:05 to request new sheets and was told that housekeeping was gone for the night so I could not get another set. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? SOMEONE ELSE COULD'NT HAVE GOTTEN ME SOME?? I ended up taking the sheets of of my bed and sleeping on top of the bedspread all night- fully dressed. The bathrooms were disgusting. peeling paint above the showers,dirty wall paper, bugs in the lights and vents full of hair and who knows what else. The air conditioner would not shut off and had to be unplugged, the phone would'nt stop beeping because someone before us apparantly had a message come in. It also had to be unplugged, the volume button on the TV did'nt work and the room smelled musty.. The pool had an area that was taped off for who know;s what reason. The worst part however was the initial walk to our rooms. We were poolside, which meant that we had to walk past inner corridor rooms. The paint was peeling off many of the doors and upon passing one room in particular, the drapes were pushed up up against the window and were fuill of large stains. It looked to us like someone could have been murdered there. Not a very welcoming sight. The next morning I called and asked for the manager on duty. I requested that he come to our rooms but told that he was busy, so he sent housekeeping in his place. She was very friendly and apologetic as I guided her through our complaint list. I was told that a new owner had taken over recently. Well, they certainly have their work cut out for them! I was told that the stained drapes room was only used for storage. I asked her to look at it through the eyes of a guest and she agreed that it was bad. Upun checking out (and cancelling our second night's stay,) I asked for their corporate office phone number. I was told that it wouldn't matter because this hotel was independently owned.. I have contacted them anyways and was told that any franchisee must maintain the Day's Inn standards or risk losing the franchise. Good luck with this one. We booked rooms at Disney where the rooms were clean, had a usable pool, restaurants that were actually open late, and wonderful activities for the children.

The entire property is in a SERIOUS state of disrepair. Walkways and walls, ceilings, etc. show signs if long-term and serious water damage. Our room, for the most part was clean. (bedding, bath, carpets. etc.) But here too were signs of major water damage, musty odor, etc. Unfortunately, there were many events going on in the area last weekend, and after spending about an hour looking for another room, we decided that since the bed and bath were clean, we could stick it out for the night. The pool was clean and in good repair, so we spent most of the evening there. I took my 10 yea old upstairs at around 6 to watch some tv and settle in. They do not even have the most basic of cable! 3 network stations, Univision and a couple of tourist info channels. There is HBO- fine for me, but not much kid appropriate on a Saturday night.

Most rooms are dated and smelly, beds are not comfy, pillows are a nightmare, it is quite noisy, tv has limited channels and the worst (at least for me) there is no internet connection (no a port, no wifi, no nothig) so we had to park at the Holiday inn parking lot to use the computer. We checked out at the second night even though we had 2 more nights paid in advance (we used priceline). I guess it depends on how picky you are and on what things are important for you in a place to stay. I would never stay here again nor recommend it to nobody", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Room\u201d", "Author": "GidgetTexas", "ReviewID": "UR19342044", "Content": "After reading the reviews, we came prepared with frebreeze, air purifier, cleaning supplies, our own bed linens as well as pillow top comforter for sleeping.

The hotel as a whole is way past its prime. The walls in my room were beat up, the walpaper in the bathroom was peeling, revealing mold underneath. The toilet was loose and if you leaned it would lean with you. The balcony between the rooms and the stairway/elevators sagged alarmingly when I dared place my entire 145 lbs onto it. I would hate to think what more weight would do! The much-touted TikiBar poolside was merely a bamboo shack which was closed, and didn't look like it had been open for a long time, something the webside failed to mention. The area of town was also less than appealing, and didn't encourage walking around to explore much. I was also approached by a local \"merchant\" shall we say, trying to sell me something I wasn't interested in. While I did have HBO, I only had about 12 channels total, and luckily I had my cell phone, or I would have been charged $1.50 per local call, and all but the 1st floor ice makers were broken. The beds were small and there was a nice little sign telling me if anything came up missing I would be charged. The arcade was about the size of a tool/utility room, and had about 3 old video games in it. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. You get what you pay for, and I got it on this trip.

I am a backpacker so the priority here was low price above all and they included shuttles to the parks in orlando. After reading some reviews I got a bit concerned, though others were recomforting so I assumed it was a bit of luck with the rooms and service. The Hotel The hotel looks old and needs a lot of maintenance, the same for the rooms, which also need deeper cleaning, I guess daily cleaning is not performed throughly. The Room Smells like a motel i guess this is standard in old carpet rooms. Since our arrival there were yellow greasse drops on the bathroom door, the wallpaper is peeled off and stained, so is the carpet. The bed was fine, clean sheets and pillow (as far as we could see). The tv works with about 20 channels. The coffe maker was broken. The towells look really old, but clean, except for the last day, one came with hairs. The pool I guess this is the best part of the hotel, very nice with a deep area. but open only until 11pm. Area Old Town Kissimmee is a small town, looks like a small town and you should not expect more. Lots of Souvenir Shops and the Old Town street has Fair-Like rides and attractions, you can drink beer along that street. We found a nice Pub with live music on the weekends, don't remember the name but is big... a live rock band perfomed really good on friday(Red Hot, Incubus, etc). Restaurants in walking distance and City Bus to Walt Disney World accors the street ($1.50us) The Shuttles I crossed emails wit the GM of the hotel before arrival and I was told there were 3 shutles in the morning and 3 in the afternoon for ALL parks. Once I got there found out there's only one ONE in the morning and ONE in the afternoon, except for Magic Kingdom. The shutles are from a different company, so the customer service is just acceptable. Late Pickups; a shutle didn't show up so we had to wait for more than an hour and take a taxi, luckily the hotel reimbursed it; Schedule changes with no advise, so we showed at the front desk at 11am but the shuttle changed the schedule to 9am the previous day, so of course, we missed it. Once the trip from Universal to the hotel took us 2 hours, the driver didn't know the way, got lost and was unfriendly with the people. The shuttles stop at many hotels before the parks and on the way back and only once we were the first to be dropped, so expect a 30min to 90min ride. The City Bus passes in front of the hotel and brings you to Disney central Station in 30 min for $1.50, from there you take free the Disney Monorail to any Disney Park. We found this to be the most convenient. The Breakfast Buffet It's 3,99 plus tax plus the beverages. Well, it's a buffet, eggs, one kind of bread, one kind of sausage, one kind of cereal, and awfull muffins. For the same price you get a way better breakfast buffet at La Ponderosa, which is within 5 minutes walking distance, and next to a nice souvenir shop. Cleanliness If you care about the cleanliness of a hotel, spend some more and go to a better one. I cared mostly about budget so I decided to stay here, but will never come back. Even though it's only for sleeping, it does not fell comfortable. So next time I wanna stay budget I'll go for a 3 star at least and rent a car... cuz in shuttles we wasted at least 3 hours per day... plus the no-show! One more advise, in Kissimmee most hotels are budget and it's a Budget-Turist town, so they'll try to go cheap on you and to get you to buy useless stuff... when apparently there's no catch, you end up caught. I thought I would bypass all the things I read in the reviews, but they made my vacation a hassle. On the last day we rceived a letter stating that the carpet was to be cleaned, and eventhough they trusted the cleaning company we should store our value goods in the safe... WTF? If you wanna stay budget think about this... are you going to Hawaii... or to Disney? The answer might ruin the Magic or the Dreams Come True thing.

But for some reason the hotel gave us a room with microfridge. Thanks Days Inn. Tip # 1 If you plan on using shuttle services make sure you're on time cause the buses fill up quickly. Thankfully Days Inn is the second hotel picked up from the lane 52 Bus Company... And if you end up being one of those unfortunate people that has to stand during your trip to Magic Kingdom, please remember that the bus services are FREE. If you have a problem with that then just rent a car. Tip # 2 The Mircofridge is a good thing to have in the room. A little side note most of the vending machines in the hotel are sold out. I dont thnk they replensh frequently. Tip # 3 The Laundry room gets hot and the coin machine was an issue when i was staying there. Just go to the front desk get change and then wash the clothes. The Bottom dryers work great. Theirs one top dryer that the door opens when drying if you must use that dryer make sure you have tape to keep the door closed. Tip # 4 Across the street to the right theres a flea market great for souvenior shopping. Tip # 5 We didn't see this supermarket until our 5th day but theirs a PUBLIX across the street where the Dunkin donuts is. Right Behind it.

Well, not with the Days Inn Maingate East. IT WAS HORRIBLE!

The pictures they show online cannot be a room at this hotel. The beds were falling apart and the bedspreads and drapes were disgusting. Now, I understand that the rates are cheap and I wasn't expecting a five-star hotel. HOWEVER, there is a standard of cleanliness that all hotels should have. This one did not. They moved us near the pool and it was loud, kids were knocking on our door, and there was garbage all over the grounds. The hotel offered a shuttle service to Walt Disney World, but you had only one time to leave each day, the service was not good and the buses were poorly maintained. We checked out early because it was so bad and stayed at the Quality Suites next door. It was obviously more expensive, but it was very clean and well-maintained. I would recommend it.

The street appearance is very deceiving, and the staff are friendly enough. The room smelled so badly of mold that I had to open all the windows during the night. I was afraid of leaving as the room was pre-paid from online site. There is no high speed internet in the rooms, and the kiosk in the lobby is a piece of outdated garbage that didn't even work when I attempted to contact Days Inn to complain. If it was not 2:00 am when I checked in, and knew the area a little bit better I would have gladly forgotten about staying and moved on. Not a good experience, and moved onto better rooms the next day. If Days Inn wants to keep their reputation of good hotels, I would strongly recommend dropping this site from their properties list.

My room was poolside, which means you don't have to look at the parking lot, but can be noisy when a lot of people are using the pool. I'd suggest trying for a room on an upper floor. In the lobby there is a person handing out welcome kits that tries to get you to take a time share tour. She wasn't very pushy and the kit has some useful samples. The room was clean, particularly the bathroom. Lots of soap, shampoo and towels with good hot water. I thought the bed especially comfortable. Normally I have trouble falling asleep in a different bed. Not here. My only complaint is that the TV was crap. Not a great picture and the volume control was disabled forcing me to listen at a slightly higer volume than I liked. Old Town is next door and is a good place for an evening stroll. It's very quiet early in the week, but picks up on Thursday & Friday. The A&W has decent hot dogs if you don't feel like a full meal. For much less than the least expensive room at WDW, this place was great.

If you're looking for a well located, decently priced and fairly clean hotel stay here! I say fairly clean because the building was obviously built in the late 60's early 70's and shows some signs of average wear & tear. If you're used to staying in 12 star resorts and have a Seinfeldian neuroses about cleanliness, don't stay here. If you're an average working stiff with a wife and two kids and your own house doesn't look like \"Lifestyles of the rich and famous.\" you'll be fine. The staff was very courteous and the hotel's proximity to Disney, Old Town, Walmart, Cvs, Walgreens and lots of cheap eateries, more then make up for any wear & tear the building has. We were there during hurricane Wilma and the hotel was great, very solid & the staff sent around daily bulletins of what to expect and what to do when Wilma finally hit.

I don't know where these other people are staying who have given it a bad review, they must be getting it mixed up with the Days Inn suites next door. We booked in late Saturday afternoon and service from reception was excellent. Within 15 minutes of booking in we were in our room. Yes, the rooms are basic, but what do you expect for the price. We were not planning to stay in the room that long, we are on holiday!! The rooms were clean, consisiting of two double beds, three chairs, table between the beds, side board with TV ect, bathroom with toilet, bath and shower and a seperate wash basin in the room. Enough for what we wanted. It may have that 70's feel about it but like I said, I have not travelled nearly 2,000 miles to sit in a room and watch tv. There is a large swimming pool with sun beds and chairs and a kids play area next to the pool. Location is fantastic, only a ten minute drive to the Disney parks and 15 to Sea World and Universal. Old town is only a minutes walk away where there are plenty of old style shops, bars, entertainment, pubs, eating houses, and rides. Perfect place to relax after a hard day at the parks. Close enough to walk to but far away enough to not be noisy. Just across the road are plenty of shops and reasuarants, with the Western Sizzler opposite that does a great breakfast buffett for $3.99. We were there every morning, stuffing our faces and that lasted till be returned from the parks. I can not praise this place highly enough, and can not understand the moaners who pay a cheap price but expect Super Gold standard. We are already planning to come back here next year. Looking for somewhere to stay so you have more money in your pocket , then this is the place to come. All the staff are very friendly and helpfull.

We arrived at about 11:30 p.m. after a long (and very hot day at Sea World) and a visit to some old neighbors in Windermere. The check-in is located in a strip mall and the area is a bit seedy, imho. The room was relatively clean (thank goodness), however it was in serious need of a paint job and new carpet. The paint in the bathroom was peeling (about a 2x2 foot area was stripped to the drywall) and several other walls were pretty badly scuffed. At least the air conditioner was working.

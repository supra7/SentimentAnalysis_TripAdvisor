We looked around at hotels in the area and they had the best rates and the rooms seemed nice so we booked 20+ rooms for our guests that weekend. Let me first state the positives of the hotel: the rooms were clean and a decent size. The pool was nice, and the location is excellent for being close to everything downtown. That being said, I have NEVER had a worse experience with a hotel in my life (considering my personality is more on the relaxed, go-with-the-flow side it takes a lot for me to get irked)! We set the block of rooms up several months before the wedding, so I was not anticipating any problems, but when I went to check into the hotel a few days before the wedding they informed me they had overbooked the hotel accidentally and didn't have a room for me. Needless to say I was angry - I am the bride of the wedding for goodness sake! And what is the point in setting up a block of rooms in advance if you are going to bump guests!? They also said that knowing it was my wedding, they meant to keep a room for me and bump guests of mine but they got confused when someone checked in with my last name (well... hello! It's a wedding for goodness sake lol) and they gave the room they were holding for me to my parents. Anyways, I was very upset that I wouldn't be able to stay in the same hotel as my guests. The best they could offer was to book me at a hotel several blocks away that had rooms available. That hotel was more expensive and they tried to tell me that they would only pay for the price difference the first night and the other 2 nights were up to me. I had to argue with the manager for some time for them to agree to pay the price difference for the entire time! I don't think that is unreasonable at all, and was frankly appalled that they were trying to make me pay for their mistake! Then I learned the next day that Springhill had also bumped my in-laws to the hotel down the road and were refusing to pay ANY of the price difference for them! I had to go back to Springhill Suites and argue AGAIN with the manager for them to pay the difference! My final complaint was that we had called ahead about 2 weeks before and asked to book a conference room one night for part of the bachelorette party. Everything seemed fine and then the night of the party we went to get the keys to the room and they said they had no record of us booking it and there was nothing they could do. I had to argue with them again! And finally I asked for the manager - I think by this point he was scared to argue with me again lol! So they let us use the room, but it was way too much hassle! Especially when we had booked it in advance. All in all I think this hotel is ok for someone who is not part of a large party. If you are planning on getting married in the area (we were married in the Starlight Room) and want to book a hotel for you and your guests I would STRONGLY recommend going to a different hotel.

I stay at Marriott's as much as possible because I am a member of their rewards program and there arent very many hotel choices in downtown Dallas. I was scheduled to be in Dallas for two weeks (which would earn me alot of nights toward elite status and points) and I chose this Springhill Suites because a few coworkers had stayed here and had decent experiences, so I may just have been unlucky but I will never return to this hotel. I checked in Sunday evening and I didn't find the staff to be particularly friendly. They didn't do anything to acknowledge my Gold status with Marriott. I was given a room on the 3rd floor (I generally prefer higher floor rooms) and upon arriving in my room I found a coffee pot with brewed coffee in it covered in a layer of mold. I understand that things like this happen sometimes so I called down to the front desk to politely ask if something could be done about it. The woman informed me that she would send someone up to swap out the pot so I said that was fine and was promptly told \"i mean is there something else you want me to do about it?\" I thought that was pretty rude and was also surprised that I received no apology at all. The maintenance man who came to swap it out was very apologetic and promised to show it to housekeeping so they could be made aware. That made me feel a little bit better so I settled into my room for the night. I found the heating/air conditioning unit to be extremely loud and it blew hot air directly onto the bed. (I'm a light sleeper) I tried to turn it off, figuring that I could sleep with it off all night and I understand that this is not in the staff's control. At about 11:30pm the city began power washing the sidewalks right outside of the hotel. I went down to the front desk because it was impossible to sleep, to see if I could possibly be moved to a higher floor or the other side of the building. I hate complaining and being an inconvenience but I could not sleep. When I went to the front desk to ask if they knew what was going on and if they knew how long it was going to last. They handed me ear plugs and acted surprised when I wanted to switch rooms. They moved my room which I appreciated but I still had a very hard time sleeping due to the air conditioning unit and I checked out the next morning and moved to the Magnolia.

The hotel is clean, but seems a little older. When you exit the elevator, instead of carpet you are greeted with older tile which transitions to carpet. Also, there were minor issues with my bathroom (e.g., chipped tiles, water temperature control not functioning well as it was mostly scolding hot, and only one light which did not extend into the shower very well - I felt like I was showering in the dark). The room was spacious, with one (older) TV and couch. The internet is free (and fast) and the refridgerator was chilled and ready to be used. There is a nearby CVS that you can use to stock up on items. My room did not have a view, but the room was quiet.

With that in mind, I rate all hotels as if I had paid what appears to be the going, discounted rate that others paid. We stayed in this hotel for two nights over spring break. We had two sights we had to see: obviously, Dealey Plaza was one. The other was the Museum of Art, which was hosting the King Tut exhibition. This hotel was three blocks from one, a half-mile to the other. Very convenient location. Also, you are right off the highway, with easy access to just about anywhere. When you first arrive, you will probably do what I did: cruise right past the place where you are supposed to enter. There is a cut-out in the building, about the width of toaster, where you are supposed to pull in to register! I would think it was just me, but I watched others go right past it when they arrived also. They have valet parking, with full in-and-out, for about $20 / day. However, across the street and down one block is a six-level ramp, with parking for $5 per day. As a matter of fact, the first day we got into the ramp before 10AM and it was only $2.50 for the day. Can't beat that in a large city. We arrived early, and they found a room for us right away; even watched the car for us while we went up to the room to drop off our bags. From beginning to end, the staff was always looking out for us, asking if we needed anything, offering advice on which restaurants were great, which ones were overpriced, where the great shopping was, etc. Again, we didn't feel as though we were in a large city hotel. I have stayed downtown in many large cities and was expecting the small, cramped room, which is the norm. On the contrary, the room was huge, with a full work area, mini-kitchen, good sleeping area, and a wonderful view of the great Dallas architecture. Very clean and the HVAC system allowed you to run the fan continuously, which we like because it blocks out the hallway noise. Amenities were OK; the pool was small, no spa to sit in. The exercise room was basic, but it did have a couple of fabulous new treadmills with built in flat-screen TV's. They did have two computers for free web-access for those of us who don't like to lug around our laptops with us. Breakfast was very good.

The room was so clean, as was the rest of the hotel. The location was good, near restaurants and bars. If I ever go back to Dallas, I will definitely stay here.

This hotel was in an excellent location in terms of local restaurants - a plus. In terms of proximity to the Convention Center, it was a good 15 minute walk and a $7.50 taxi ride back - a negative. The hotel had indicated on the phone that they had a free shuttle but it did not operate on the weekend. The room was large, well maintained, included a kitchen area/table and the wireless free -- big pluses. But, the room had a strange layout that included having the sink in the same area as the beds, meaning that turning on the light to use the sink disturbs any still sleeping. Further, the air conditioning was good but incredibly loud. The TV was relatively small and hard to see from one of the beds. The included breakfast buffet is very nice -- a plus and an excellent value, particularly for families. Except when the worker responsible does not show -- a negative. On the Saturday when the worker did not show, a staff member went out and bought about 200 take out egg sandwiches from McDonalds to put out -- OK but not a breakfast buffet. There is no manager's reception on the weekends. Staff ranged from very helpful and friendly -- a plus -- to rude and indifferent -- a negative. Sometimes, cheerful greeting. Sometimes, the front desk did not answer the phone and staff monitoring to ensure food did not run out at the buffet was missing.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, OK", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place!\u201d", "Author": "modcon", "ReviewID": "UR8394327", "Content": "What can I say? This was a great experience. The rooms were clean, large and comfortable. I can honestly say I haven't stayed in a nicer budget style suite hotel. Plenty of towels and quick response to requests. The staff was efficient and VERY friendly. They had a free wine/beer hour every night, as well as a karaoke night while we were there (which turned out to be a lot of fun!) The included buffet breakfast was fresh, hot and well tended in a clean, area with pleanty of tables (an unusual situation with this type of breakfast.) And the selection had something for every taste. Parking is an issue - as it is in any downtown area. You can pay $20/day for valet parking with unlimited in and out service (and they are very quick with the cars - and careful about parking them - no door dings!). Or you can park it yourself in the garage or lot across the street and pay each time you pull into the lot. Which you choose will depend on how long your stay will be and how often you plan on moving your car. We stayed for two nights to attend a concert at the American Airlines Center. This hotel was within walking distance. The West End has not fared very well the last few years, but it still has some decent restaurants and there is a whole group of new places opening around the West End proper. Highly recommended if you are attending any events near the West End.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel is Exactly What Was Expected\u201d", "Author": "CJKatl", "ReviewID": "UR6596484", "Content": "This hotel delivered pretty much everything one should expect in a Springhill Suites.

Same for the desk clerks, who allowed me a very late check-out. Cheerfully. The location was great. I woke up early and took a walk through downtown Dallas and the West End. Later, I walked to my meeting at the Adam's Mark. I also needed to buy a new razor, so the drug stor across the street was a big plus.

The staff was friendly and helpful with directions. My only complaint is the loud air conditioner. It's the same as I had in a Springhill Suites in Rockville, MD last summer.

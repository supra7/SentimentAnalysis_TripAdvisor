The hotel had online special offering 3rd night free which allowed us to book a two room suite. The suite was great with a large king bedroom, bathroom and flat screen TV in an area separated by frosted sliding doors. The \"living area\" had a massage chair (which the kids loved) another flat screen TV and a day bed which was great for sitting but wasn't that comfortable as a sleeping bed. The bathroom was a bit small with not much getting ready space but the living area had a desk which worked out great. The staff was accomodating and made our day bed quickly and were quick to respond when I accidentally broke the glass shelf in the bathroom (watch out - not anchored too securely). The lobby/bar area is modern and they had a trio performing during happy hour which we enjoyed. Champagne at check-in was nice touch and the location can't be beat. We had a street facing room and it wasn't' too loud at any time. There's a Dunkin' Donuts a few doors down which was good for a quick breakfast and parking, although $$, was convenient in a garage next door.

Possibly because I booked the \"superior queen\" on a third party site I was initially given un unacceptable a room....on a lower floor, very small with one small window looking over a bank of NOISY air conditioners. I complained and this was rectified immediately. Second room was actually far better, on an upper floor, no street view but VERY quiet. Window opened for fresh air. Bed was extremely comfortable, great sheets and pillows. Everything worked perfectly...massage chair, free WIFI, flat-screen TV, BOSE sound system. Not a lot of room in bedroom but great bathroom, walk-in shower/no bath. Spotless. Eveda amenities. Fluffy white towels/no bathrobe. This accommodation was perfect for me....but I can understand that it will not be satisfactory for others. Not a lot of storage space and no desk to speak of...just a narrow workspace. The hotel is in two adjoining buildings with two entrances. Modern design...lots of citrus colours, greens and greys....odd common areas, not really functional. I rarely saw a doorman/porter. The building where my room was located had an entrance near a bar/restaurant. There was never a doorman present and you did not have to walk past the front desk. I did not use the bar/restaurant so cannot comment. The location is absolutely PERFECT....you can not beat 5th Avenue and 55th Street. This hotel is located next to two major five star hotels....so you get the picture. Lots of food options just outside the hotel door. Great access to subways/buses. The front desk staff were helpful, once the initial room situation was settled. The housekeeping did an excellent job. Great free expresso machine on ground floor in one of the buildings. So, if you book here....especially through a third-party site, make sure you check out the room before settling in. I have the impression that some are MUCH better than others. Would I stay here again....definitely.

Room was worth the extra $. BTW, we didn't eat at the hotel, so we can't say how good the food was. Pros: room was larger than most NY hotel rooms and very clean; great king-sized mattress (real king, btw, not the shrunken king at some hotels) that was just firm enough. Separate oversized shower & tub combo. Larger bathroom. Outdoor patio access via glass sliding doors, lots of natural light, quiet (room was at back of hotel); efficient & courteous staff - extras we asked for came promptly. They stored our luggage with no hassle. Easy booking a car to the airport ($85 one-way transfer, plus tax, tip). And, great location! The hotel is on a quiet street but it's only half-block away from shopping on 5th ave. and both high- and low-end restaurants. It's also only a few blocks from Rockefeller, Times Square, Broadway, MoMA, Central Park, Trump, subway, etc. There's also a food mart around the corner at 55 & 6. We tried out different delis, and as the Peninsula is half-block away, and we splurged on their breakfast buffet twice - yum! Never had problem catching a cab at front of the hotel. cons: bathroom door does not lock! There's limited counter space around the sink, and only one hard chair and the massage chair in the room. There's a tiny desk and very little room to put your things away. The patio is lovely, but it's shared with the suite next door w/o a privacy wall/fence. Also, the vents would emit smoke odor into our room (I suspect this happened when someone on our floor was smoking in their room). Honestly, if it wasn't for the shared patio leading to lack of privacy/security, I think I would have given the hotel 5 stars - but it freaked me out that whoever was staying next door could walk over anytime to the glass sliding doors and look in. Further, I noticed the patio isn't enclosed - it seems to encircle the roof level all around the building - we heard someone (we hope/assume it was the hotel security) walk past the glass door at dark, so we assumed others (staff, etc.) had access to that patio area at all times. The sliding glass door didn't look all that secure to me, so that was a major concern as well. If they can fix that, I'd give the hotel 5 stars.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longmont, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWeekend in the Big Apple\u201d", "Author": "ColoradoJilly", "ReviewID": "UR123922641", "Content": "We stayed at the Shoreham because we got a really good deal online. 3rd night free.

The only issue I had with Price Line will give you one of the cheapest rates, but there is a catch to it, you get what you pay for. A one small room with one bed.

It was apparent to me they are poorly managed. The front desk is actually amazing and clearly places operational convenience over old fashioned good hospitality. We requested consideration for an early arrival when making the reservation, but upon arrival, found no one had even read it. The nice folks behind the desk are friendly...\"You guys\" check your luggage (Robot Response). \"We don't guarantee the room will be ready until 3:00pm\". So, we checked our luggage and left to enjoy the city. Arriving back at 3PM, the desk clerk attempted to verify the availability of our assigned room by making calls over a fifties something walkie-talkie. Now we were thinking this looks like a \"used car lot.\" In most hotels this is done out of the site of the guest and much more efficiently. Incidentally, the clerks are not in uniform, open collar shirts looking more like someone you would find in your neighborhood hardware store, not a New York hotel. The clock behind the desk was missing the dials. Then there is the game of who will be offered a glass of champagne or water, but that appeared to be sheer luck, we were not lucky. Now, onto the room a \"Superior Plus King\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Very spacious two room jr. suite Room 803. The bed is GREAT... LCD's in both the parlor and bedroom and a Bose radio a real plus.... Good recessed lighting. Room appeared to be recently decorated and had some nice features like the milky white glass doors throughout. Pathetic lack of attention to guest conveniences... drawer space, closet space and the worst the bathroom. Although very pleasing to the eye, the bathroom is hardly big enough to breath in. There is no room for even the most modest needs for a guest to shower and dress. My shaving kit had to either placed on the floor or in the nearby bedroom. The rain forest shower head was a welcome find. The carpet is old and worn. The mini bar fridge had no space to keep anything cool. The guest room floor hallway is about half as wide as normally found in hotels leading me to think this building must be an apartment building trying to be a hotel, but failing in most areas. There are nice touches... the complementary new paper in the Sunday New York Times and the coffee/tea station off the lobby. The location is great and an easy walk to Saint Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Fifth Avenue Shopping, MoMa, and Rockefeller Center etc. The would be a really great hotel to come to for a one night sleepover after a night at a club or out partying. We are over that phase of life and desire more attention to creature comforts over flash and dash. Just go without expectations and you could possibly enjoy the experience. Good luck.... we may go back if the rate is really great and for one night only. Just one last note, the bellmen can be both good and bad.

For midtown in October this was reasonable, but I feel sorry for anyone who paid above that rate for their small, poorly designed room. It began with an un-friendly lengthy check in, no doorman, no offer of help with luggage, and the maze-like lobby. I arrived at one p.m. and hoped that, given their 3pm check in time, my room might be ready a bit early. Understandably it wasn't, so I asked about their business center as I had an important call to place that afternoon before the room would be ready. The front desk noted that the business center - if two small computers placed in a nook of the lobby can be called that - was open but probably not a good spot to make a call. They directed me to the restaurant. Fortunately, the restaurant staff were very hospitable to my presence and even reminded me before the kitchen closed in case I wanted lunch. I asked a couple of times about my room, just in case, but evidently they are very strict about 3pm. For a small, \"boutique\" hotel, I would have expected a bit more leniency on this. For example, I've stayed at many other small boutique hotels where I have been able to check in as early as 11am in the city. I had booked a Deluuxe Luxury Queen, not the cheapest room in the place, but I was very surprised to see that there was no desk present in the room.

Also, the tiny ironing board was broken and barely big enough to iron a shirt on. And, since there was no desk to place the ironing board on (it was not a stand alone), I had to iron on my bed which was interesting to say the least.

I have stayed here twice, once in Aug 2010 and once in Aug 2011, and both stays were for 3 nights. Both stays were for a shopping trip with my girlfriend. Check in is efficient and friendly. Valet helped with my luggage upon check in and check out. For my last stay, we had room 805 - a single queen room. The room was right outside the elevator, and a little noisy (can hear everything going on in the hall), so I wouldn't get this room again (I'm a pretty light sleeper). Also, I think it is a little too small for 2 girls with lots of luggage. The bathroom was relatively spacious for the size of the room. The drain in the shower/tub was a little clogged up, otherwise no issues. The biggest issue with this room was really the temperature -- the room didn't cool down very well The A/C which was on full blast. It took about 4 hours to get the room to an idea temperature (the temp outside was in the 80s). The first night of our stay, I was up throughout the night sweating until the room finally cooled off. Last year, we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. For the price, I would definitely book a 2 bedroom suite next time i stay- well worth the extra money. It felt spacious, was quiet and there were no issues with the temperature in the room. Like all the reviews say, this room is in a great location.

The Shoreham is our hotel of choice in NYC for business due to it's location and boutique feel. A tip though is try and do anything possible to get at least one room upgrade from the basic room, since the basic room is very small particularly for a couple. Realizing that many rooms in NYC are small and generally expensive, if your stay here is going to be that big NYC trip you've been waiting for - spend the extra money on a room upgrade. Sometimes I have gotten the basic room, and a few times I've been upgraded and I can tell you I have much enjoyed this place with the upgraded junior 1 bedroom suite. The rooms are pretty spartan but tasteful. Some of the upgraded rooms have massage chairs which is well appreciated after a day of meetings or walking around NYC. I haven't experienced the noise issue from the fans, or the noisy hallways but almost all hotels have big heavy doors for fire blocks - they aren't that good for soundproofing so you are going to hear the hallway everywhere. NYC is active 24 hours a day so you're going to hear street noise all the time - since they do a lot of construction and streetwork at night, and the garbage trucks are always active at night. If you're a light sleeper bring earplugs - for anywhere in NYC not just this hotel The bathroom situation as described in other posts is confirmed - the basic rooms have a decent size bathroom (i.e. you can walk in and around) but really small room. The upgraded rooms (at least one or two levels above a basic) have a really small bathroom - like you can step in and brush your teeth with the back of your leg hitting the toilet. So keep that in mind. You are going to get this pretty much anywhere in New York so if you are used to space, be prepared and appreciate it when you stay in a place that isn't so crammed with people. There is a designer lobby bar which is a good place to get a drink before going out, and doubles for the breakfast option. But keep in mind you have so many other options nearby - you don't have to pay the big dollars for hotel food and drink if you don't want to. Your location is great for proximity to shopping, subways and Central Park. Another tip for some reviews I read from people who try and check in early and then get miffed the room isn't ready at like 1pm - are usually the people who want the late checkout and then don't understand why the hotel can't clean 200 rooms in like 90 minutes. I often arrive well before the usual 3 or 4pm checkin time and usually phrase my discussion with the front desk as \"i know i'm early but just wondering if by chance the room might be ready...\" and am nice about realizing they really aren't under any obligation to have the room ready. I'd say they find me a room about 75% of the time. The Shoreham will call your mobile when the room is ready if you do arrive early and they don't have anything yet, although many times they find me a room they've already turned over. Sometimes the room rate even for the basic room can hit close to $300-400 depending on occupancy and time of year - so for the people that get online deals or special offers in the $150 range, that is pretty good value.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Groton, MA", "Title": "\u201cWelcoming boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "sandie1947", "ReviewID": "UR115025419", "Content": "Upon arrival and departure, the front door was opened for us.

So if you're carrying a lot of luggage, seek help. Or you will have to make two/three trips. Cab fare to this location from LaGuardia was 29.00 including tolls and tip. We had three people in my group with checked luggage so we had a trunk full of bags. We had to upgrade to a Jr. suite to accommodate two adults and one teenager due to no basic rooms with two beds. Something I will discuss later in my review. The room was small to be called a \"Jr. Suite\" even compared to other hotels I've stayed at in midtown at the same price. The bathroom was standard and the \"jacuzzi\" tub did not work. So the only upgrade we received for 100.00 more a night was a European sofa so our teenager would have a place to sleep. This hotel is a great choice for the couple seeking midtown location to stay for leisure. Business travelers would also benefit by this location with business in the midtown area.

I used priceline (sorry TripAdvisor!) and was awarded a price of $235.00 per night at this location. Because priceline states that the price includes only 2 adults - I contacted the hotel directly to secure a room with two beds. Of course they didn't have any basic rooms with two beds at the price I bid through Priceline. So I was pretty much a hostage of using the hotel and was forced to pay an extra 100.00 per night for a sofa. Priceline would not help me in any way. Needless to say this is the first and last time I will use Priceline, Net result is that I don't know if the hotel took advantage of my situation or whether they were full. The front desk acted like they couldn't understand English. At this point I really had no choice but to pay for the upgrade. So even though my experience with this hotel started out badly, I still would probably stay at the Shoreham again if I were traveling alone or traveling with my spouse. Unless you book directly with the hotel and secure the necessary bedding, I would not recommend this hotel for families. During this trip we only ate breakfast at the on-site hotel. Breakfast for three people was $60 US. They offer a continental menu option but with tip it would still be $16-$20 US per person. Sorry to say we did not try any other meals at the hotel. The breakfast choices we made were good. Service was ok. But I think the service staff and kitchen staff were having a bad morning the day we dined. Overall I rated this hotel average because I've stayed at other hotels in midtown and had more room for same or less cost per night. The only selling point of this hotel is the location in my opinion if you want to or must stay in midtown. The boutique aspects of the hotel were nice but they are due to update the property. I rated the value of this hotel low due to the size of the room vs the price charged.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "charlie_nl", "ReviewID": "UR104011821", "Content": "We had a long weekend in Ny - and stayed at this nice hotel.

The location was perfect. It was near great restaurants, close to the major art galleries, concert halls, Central Park and the subway yet it was surprisingly quiet, especially in the evenings, given its proximity to major thoroughfares. It was also only a couple of blocks away from the subway for the D train which is the line that takes you straight out to the new Yankees baseball stadium within about 25 minutes. And all the staff, from those on the main desk to the porters, the cleaning staff, the bartenders and waiters were simply fantastic. All were genuinely friendly, helpful and polite. We arrived at the hotel considerably later than planned due to delays at the airport and were concerned that perhaps the hotel might have given our rooms away. And because of traffic our taxi couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t park right outside the hotel. But as soon as we got our luggage out of the taxi the hotel porter came straight up to greet us in the street and took our luggage into the lobby and then straight up into the room while we checked-in. At the check-in desk we were immediately offered complimentary cold drinks which were life savers as we hadn't had a drink for a few hours and we were very hot and tired by the time we arrived. We stayed in their Junior Spa suite and when we got into the room it was lovely and cool as the air conditioner had been left on in advance of our arrival. The bedroom area was comfortable and the shower room was quite large with great water pressure and super clean with lots of towels. The only thing I missed was one of those extending wall mirrors that has a magnifying lens on one side because I don't have great eyesight and because of the sink I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get close enough to the main mirror. But there was lots of lighting in the bathroom which was helpful. The air conditioner unit was easy to operate and relatively quiet for an air conditioner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was a slight hum but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep us awake. Before arriving we'd read some reviews which said the decor was a bit tired. And it was as there were a few scuff marks here and there on the skirting boards and the furniture in the lounge area did look a bit worn in places but that didn't bother us. There was plenty of room and it was spotlessly clean. The bed was reasonably firm with nice linen and there was lots of good lighting by the bed. There was no wonderful view as the room but again that wasn't a priority for us. The elevator was big enough for 2 adults and 2 suitcases but no more. The room was also quiet and we didn't hear our neighbours except when they were outside in the corridor. We ate dinner at the hotel a couple of times, on our first and last night, and both times we were impressed with the standard of the cooking and the quality of the food. The bar and waiting staff were great and mixed great cocktails - my husband said his Manhattan was one of the best he'd every had. And as one of bar tenders had just recently finished his doctoral thesis in American history he was very interesting to talk to and a really nice chap. Before arriving we were concerned about tipping especially as we'd heard stories from friends who'd stayed elsewhere who said they always had to have their hands in their pockets ready to tip everyone. But at this hotel the policy is to automatically add on a service charge to say the food or drink bills, which is what we're used to in the UK, which meant we didn't feel obliged to be constantly tipping within the hotel because we knew staff weren't relying on tips to survive. On the ground floor of the hotel there is a lounge area behind the bar/dining area which, when we were there, had a great display featuring all the best 'on trend' clothes, bags and jewellery as picked from Harpers Bazaar magazine. It was closed when we came across it and I only wished I'd discovered it earlier as it would have been nice to have gone in to have a closer look at all everything before hitting the shops. Although I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible but the window display was still pretty slick so you could see lots of very nice things which really wetted the appetite. Security was very good in the hotel - visible but low-key - the staff on the main door remembered us from Day One so we came and went as we liked and we felt very safe all the time we were in the hotel. In fact security in general was pretty high in the whole area because while we were there the UN General Assembly was taking place which meant large numbers of diplomats were in town and staying at nearby hotels. There were teams of police practically on every street corner and police cars were constantly patrolling the area. The only downside was that we couldn't get in to visit the UN at any time during our stay. So if the UN is somewhere you want to see don't visit New York during the last two weeks in September when the UN General Assembly are in session. Another tip is that the hotel has very good complimentary maps and also stocks complimentary copies of Time Out New York magazine. And their 24 hour coffee/tea area is a great amenity too. They have two internet screens in the downstairs lobby which you can use whenever you want and there's a printer which is also free to use. And once you get a password from the main desk you can also access WiFi. We never got to try out their gym but we had a look 'round and the equipment was what we were used to back in the UK and it looked very clean and well lit with lots of mirrors. The hotel also arranged our airport transfers to and from JFK. The cars we both clean and spacious. However, when we arrived we took ages getting through immigration and consequently the driver charged us more than we'd been quoted because of the extra waiting time so bear that in mind if you pre-arrange a taxi pick-up. There seemed to be plenty of taxis at the airport but it was nice to hop into a large air-conditioned car on a hot day. Lastly, like other trip advisors we found that booking direct via the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website was more expensive than booking via a specialist travel website. We used a site called newyorkcityluxuryhotels.com who were excellent and able to get us the Junior Spa suite for the same price as a standard room at the hotel. All in all we had a great time in New York which was due, in no small part, to staying at The Shoreham. If it were a publicly quoted stock we'd be buyers! My husband is already planning our stay there next year. We hope you find the above information useful. Please bear in mind it was our first stay in New York so we don't have any other New York hotel experience to compare it to but even still we really enjoyed our stay at The Shoreham and hope you do too - the staff really are pretty special here.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel but (with typical for NY) small rooms!\u201d", "Author": "neilthestooge", "ReviewID": "UR85378769", "Content": "Great service at this hotel and within a few minutes of time square, just incredibly an small room (which was on the 2nd floor so the view was dreadful!).

Here are some notes about our stay: ---very modern looking futuristic furniture inside lobby with a large t.v. monitor built into the wall; very low ceilings throughout lobby and lounge: I could touch the ceiling easily and I am 5'9\". ---service was good, albeit very business-like; we were able to check in 2 hours early and were offered champagne or Voss sparkling water upon arrival. We chose water because it was so hot and humid. ---The hotel building has two facades: an older one on the East side of the building, a newer one on the West. I had read on Oyster.com that the rooms on the East, older side had higher ceilings and since we chose a basic Superior Queen room anyway, I figured to just request a room on the East side. However, the lady after checking her computer said that those rooms were all booked (even though the hotel inside did not seem to be very busy with a lot of patrons) so instead we were assigned a room on the newer West side of the building--room 911. Of course, I immediately noted the irony when she casually informed us of this, so in response, I said playfully, \"oh thats a little disconcerting\". She then reassured us that it will be fine, so off we went with our luggage as we declined an offer for the bellhop to bring them up for us. ---The good thing about the West building is that the 2 elevators are much roomier; enough to fit 2 people, 3 carry-ons, and 1 large suitcase. The other elevator on the East side is a phone booth sized lift, which we never needed anyway since we were on the newer West side of the building. ---the elevator ride was pleasant; dimly lit with small colorful club lighting near the ceiling of elevator and good dance music playing, but very quietly; ---the hallways to the rooms are very cramped but its normal for a boutique hotel ---The room itself was surprisingly roomy and very clean! It had a low ceiling mainly due to the design of the room, as the bed's headboard extended across the ceiling, but very modern looking and sleek and new! ---There was in fact, a large window with ample light coming through and a view of the tops of buildings next door and further away, views of much taller buildings which appeared to have housed businesses inside. You could see easily through the window so not much privacy, but there was a shade to pull down plus a curtain so no worries there. ---The bathroom was pleasantly large for a boutique hotel room! A regular sized bathtub with a huge mirror on the wall of the bathtub. Tiny sink but ample vanity space for toiletries around the sink and above the toilet. ---we noticed right when we walked in to the room, the toilet was making flushing noises, so I walked over to it and saw that it kept flushing itself every 3 or 4 seconds. This turned out to be only a minor problem as we quickly called front desk and they sent up a maintenance worker who resolved the issue in 10 minutes. ---In the room, there was some very ingeniously placed lighting, terrific shade of light green color, a good sized closet with a mini safe, a little bar inside the dresser with some snacks for sale, which we never needed, as well as an LCD 32\" LG television which had poor reception on a few channels. Again, this didn't bother us since we didn't come to NYC to watch t.v. ---Sleep quality was good although the bed is smaller than a standard queen size bed, the pillows and mattress were terrific. The AC worked most of the time but there was a constant humming of the AC during the night whether it was on or off and we couldn't tell if it was coming from the room or the building next door. Wife had a problem with the noise as she slept with pillows covering her ears, but it didn't bother me much. ---there was a bench at the end of the bed which I promptly moved off to the side to create more space and placed our 1 large suitcase on top. I put one carry-on in the closet on top of the fold-out suitcase holder. I put the other carry-on on top of the window sill and scooted the little circular glassy bedside table over a few inches to give the carry-on more surface area and I still had enough room to place a bottled water on top. ---Curiously, there was no alarm clock and no bath robes in the room although if you were to request bath robes, it would be available. You can just use your cell phone for an alarm as we did or call front desk for a wake-up call. ---the location was great for us! Since we are in our early 30's, we were able to traverse the streets of Manhattan easily and willingly to see many of the exciting attractions the City had to offer. The hotel's block (W. 55th between 5th and 6th) was very busy with your typical hustle and bustle of NYC. There were a few restaurants and bars that were crowded in the evenings. There was a Dunkin Donuts and a Five Guys burger place right next door. The Shoreham's own low-ceilinged lobby bar was crowded only 1 night we were there; a great speaker system throughout lobby and the bar but the volume was kept at a minimum the whole time. They have a great breakfast menu, their Eggs Benedict was delicious albeit around $15. Their continental b-fast was $17 which included cereals, pastries, multi-grain toast and juice. They have a wonderful FREE selection of tea packets, a coffee, espresso, cappuccino machine in a little room off the lobby in which you can take with you on the go which we did each morning even in the searing heat and humidity. ---by the 2 elevators at the end of the lobby, there was on-going construction of a room that was to house \"The Willow Club\" a private membership club in which The Shoreham as well as other hotels in Manhattan are involved; Luckily however, this construction did not interfere with our stay at all as far as dust and noise level was concerned. --Overall, I would recommend the Shoreham on 3 counts: 1) If you like the positives I stated above and don't mind the negatives (of which there were not many), 2) If you are a young energetic couple who like walking anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes or more to see the major attractions including museums and Harbor cruises (the MoMA was only 2 short blocks away, conversely, the Circle Line cruises were many many blocks away, a half-hour walk at least) 3) Lastly, if you can get a great deal online from an outside company and not from the Shoreham website; do your research and book in advance! For example, try Easyclicktravel.com. We bought through their website a few months in advance and paid up front in full. In the end we spent a total of $609 for 4 nights, which comes to about $152/night and this was Wednesday through Sunday. It was a great deal considering how difficult it can be to get a quality hotel at this price during tourist season with a decent location (Central Park only 4 short blocks away, Rockefeller Center 5 blocks away, Times Square 10 blocks away). If I can get 4 nights at this price again, I would definitely stay at the Shoreham. ---Last note, if its your first time in NYC, get the Citypass. You can see 6 major sights for $79 including the Statue of Liberty, Circle Line cruise, Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center and some museums like MoMA and the Met.

We were moved two days after in a room with the view on the street and it was much much better. The same tiny room, but better as a feeling. The staff at the reception was great and found as the room to switch, although it was fully booked during our stay.

Maintenance had to turn on the heating in the basement to warm the room. Heating pipes banged and clattered all night. I couldn't turn off heat or even adjust it down, and it became unbearably hot. That night had to crack the window open to keep the room livable. Cooking grease odors flowed in through the window. Big gap around room door not only let in light, but allowed me to see feet of passersby. Room's only phone was cordless and lost signal every few seconds, so was unusable. I carry cell phones from two carriers (Verizon and AT&T) and neither got signal, so I was effectly out of touch with the world. I tried to change rooms the first night but was told hotel was sold out. Morning of Feb. 2 a water hammer started in the shower, banging and rattling rhythmically, so loud that I couldn't stand it. Several of us in the fifth floor changed rooms. Feb. 2 moved to room 208. Same heating problem; couldn't turn down heat so had to crack open windows. More cooking grease odors, plus a new problem: tobacco smoke stink from employees smoking just beneath my windows. They wouldn't leave. Heating pipes banged incessantly. Light bulb burned out in ceiling reading light over bed. Desk lamp switch wouldn't work and lamp was on when I arrived. Had to find plug and yank out the cord to turn it off. TV remote didn't work and maintenance promised replacement but it never came. Room had no hair dryer, although one was brought after I stepped out of the shower and called. Between pipe banging, heat and stink, was up and down much of the night opening or closing window. There was, of course, no pen to use in filling in the comment card.

There was also free wifi / internet (2 pc available for the guests + printer). There was also a gym but we never used it. The staff was polite and smiling. Upon check-out (12 noon) we had our luggage kept for a few hours at no extra cost.

I did not have any problems with the water temperature as I read in another review. The hotel was pretty quiet which we liked. We never saw anyone on our floor and were mostly by ourselves in the elevator. The cappacino station on the 1st floor was our favourite part. You can get hot chocolate, latte, coffee, tea, etc. It helped in the morning to wake us up when we were rushing to get our day going. We just grabbed something to drink for our morning walk to whereever and it tied us down until we got something to eat. The first night I found the noise from the street quite loud and seemed as if the window was opened although there were no windows, but the rest of the nights I slept find, probably because we were so dead tired. We didn't get bathrobes in our room - Superior Queen. I thought our room didn't get it but I just read now that we should have gotten them.

When we walked into the room, we were greeted with 3 pieces of fresh chocolates on a designed plate (not just pre-wrapped chocolate) along with a handwritten note from the hotel manager, which was a nice touch. Also, since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, I called ahead to request that a small card with a particular inscription be left in the room upon our arrival, and this was nicely done. I requested the same of 60 Thompson in Soho, but their reply was that they were a boutique hotel and couldn't do it. The bathroom was luxurious, with 3 shower heads, although for the 3 days we stayed, we always had variable-temperature water. It would go from hot to cold to lukewarm back to hot - all very quickly so as not to scald or freeze, but the water temperature never stayed constant. At first I thought this was from other guests flushing toilets, but that doesn't explain the range of temperatures nor the frequency of change. Also, with all 3 shower heads on simultaneously, the drain rate was not fast enough and water began to accumulate and rise in the shower. Shortly after arriving we went to The Bar for an afternoon cappucino pick-me-up, and when we returned to the room, we had turn down service and 2 brownies on our bedside! Housekeeping was always quick to respond to our needs (ice and extra sheets). The free internet on the lobby floor came in handy when we wanted to confirm subway directions to the Brooklyn Museum - 2 computer stations with 1 printer, although the printer was out of service. The elevators were small, but there were 2 and each fit 3 people with 3 suitcases comfortably, and they were never overcrowded, which was nice for a boutique. Also helpful were the displays on each floor letting you know where the elevator was (sometimes the little things make a big difference). The midtown location is very convenient.

The lobby is very strange, very unobtrusive from the street, nice idea but it was a mess and the very low ceiling is just weird.

Upon arriving to the hotel we saw about 15 people waiting at the lobby, so we simply went to the modernish restaurant they have facing the street and had a late lunch. The doorman took care of our bags and after about an hour of having lunch we approached the front desk to check in. The first issue that came up was our credit card not being read by their system, then our room was not ready even though it was 4pm and check in time is advertised as 3pm. Then, once the very cold concierge gave us our room keys, our bellman helped us to our room, which upon arriving to it was not clean. We went back to the lobby with the bellman to sort this out and we found ourselves caught in the very uncomfortable position of listening to a manager talking down to one of the front desk people. The bellman tried to get this manager's attention but enough time had already gone by and enough had been said that made me and my girlfriend realize that there is no personal touch in this hotel whatsoever. Once the manager realized we were waiting, he turned on this strange smile and directed us to another person at the front desk. The lady who finally helped us get into a clean room was very quick and efficient, though we realized that the level of stress at this lobby was making us very uncomfortable. We have been very lucky to travel around the world and we have always left tips for employees, specially for maids, but after running into these uncomfortable situations, we decided to write a review online so that hopefully true honest sincere service does become a reality.

There is one chair parked beneath a narrow table surface (about 18 inches wide?), between the bed and the table surface. If pulled out for sitting, the path from the door to the window is blocked.

The bathroom is small with a stainless steel sink which drained slowly so we called the engineer to fix the stopped up pipes - he came up immediately and fixed the problem forthwith, so we thought, until it started plugging up again, so we just let it go as it was not a major issue.

Shoreham offers the Spa package, but before booking I call and ask specifically if we can book the package but in a king superior room, but still get the spa package deal, with champagne, chocolates, some body scrubs or whatnot and spa treatment. 1st thing, they book us in the junior suite. nOT a king bed. Very uncomfortable for us, we are not obese, but not petite, and, the point is, I specifically requested the king. When I called the front desk I was robotically politely informed that there were no other rooms available and that I didn't want them anyway. No view. Shower ran water ALL over the floor (they should add a lip on the door to prevent this - should cost them all of 25 bucks.) Shower was awesome though (many heads in this suite) although I would have given them all up and the jacuzzi (I told them this when I called to book it in the first place) for the KING SIZED BED.) Free breakfast is continental, not the hot menu. Bar is nice, and bar staff was nice in the evening, snooty in the morning. Didn't get the chocolates or the bath spa stuff. the spa treatments were across the street at a nice little place, and very nice. SPoke to concierge?

He promised some female manager whose name escapes me would call. No call. I called many times. no call from the mystery woman.

The best experience at the hotel was the check in, after midnight. So fast it was amazing, perfect after a long flight. Well, that was it, because we get to the room and it has only one small bed, obviously not what we had booked. We decided to simply show up at the lobby in the morning, so I go to take a shower and my brother is already trying to sleep. I happen to pay attention to the water which is draining towards the bathroom floor but I think nothing of it. Unfortunately, the water got all the way from the shower, onto the bathroom floor and then to the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carpet. I had to use a few extra towels to dry out the carpet and the bathroom floor, of course by now my brother was helping me, I had already made too much noise and that room was, to put it in a nutshell, a \"tiny walnut\". The next morning when we are heading for the elevator, we run into someone who seemed to work at the hotel . He was a handyman and he already knew about this specific issue in this specific room. Now there was no question about it, we needed a room change. Not only two beds, but please a bathroom that does not drain onto the bedroom. Luckily Daphe, the reason for this review, took care of us immediately. She asked us just two questions and said she was setting things up, so we tell her that we would like to talk to a manager, to which she nodded as making a call and continuing to work. She said that the manager would be with us shortly and that our new room would be ready in less than 10 minutes, so we decided to wait at the lobby, which by the way has very low seats. After about five minutes Daphe calls us to the desk. As we are standing up she gets interrupted by another phone call. At this point, out of the clear blue sky, a person who introduced himself as Ireki, while handing us a card, let us know that the general manager was not available. I was about to let him know that we were not in a rush, specially given the fact that our new room may now be ready, but he did not seem to know this. He started telling us how sorry he was about the incident and how this never happens, contrary to what the handyman had told us a few minutes before. I decided not to make him feel uncomfortable and I simply ask to leave a message for the general manager, which I did. I then try to go back to Daphe but I got once again awkwardly approached by Ireki who was asking for a confirmation of my booking, which I had already shown to her. At this time Daphe, who was still on the phone, hands me a new set of keys and waves to the bellman. Ireki was now in silence. Our bellman, Zaty, helped us go from the tiny walnut to a two beds real size room, he was ever so kind. After our few nights at the shoreham I must admit that I was impressed by the level of cleanliness and the professionalism of Daphe and Zaty, but we did not get a call back from neither Ireki, apparently the head concierge, nor the general manager. Daphe saved our trip, we asked for her upon leaving, but she was not around. We did not feel comfortable leaving a tip for her during our check out, they seemed to be very busy and somewhat disorganized during that sunday morning. All in all cool bar and bartenders, the entire lobby is all white and marble, extremely minimalist. The flower arrangements were very sophisticated and chic, although they did not match the cheap looking, low seats at the lobby. Also, the coffee machine that is literally two steps away from three public restrooms, definitively not a good choice for location. The Hallways on the floors were not air conditioned, neither were the elevators, extremely hot. Room type booked was not at all what we were given. Very clean rooms, excellent location, good rooms with two beds, tiny rooms with one bed, some showers leak onto the bedroom, no discounts nor amenities given nor offered, no answer from management, so thank God for Daphe.", "Date": "June 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice, hip hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "SteveUrq", "ReviewID": "UR7976799", "Content": "We just returned from our weekend at The Shoreham and we were quite pleased with the hotel and our room.

The place had grown shabby, noisy and threadbare. Now, I'm happy to report the Shoreham has made a terrific recovery. I believe all of its rooms have been thoroughly overhauled and updated. Its capacity has more than doubled with the addition of a new west wing. And, although still pricey by national standards, the Shoreham - for its location and amenities - is an upscale bargain in midtown Manhattan. I've stayed in a lot of different rooms since the remodeling, and they are all more or less stylistically similar: neutral beige walls offset by mildly tufted, patterened, sea-green fabric wall panels. Furnishings and wall decorations are blonde wood with simple, modern lines. The beds are high and very comfortable, with a generous array of pillows. Lighting is minimal, but all dimmer-controlled, and the room can go from bright and cheery to shadowy and romantic. Here too are thoughtful touches such as individual reading pin spots over the bed, and headboard lighting controlled from bedside. Each room is equipped with a nice LG flatscreen TV, with a remote that actually lets you adjust the screen dimensions so that regular broadcasts aren't elongated and weird-looking; the Shoreham is the only hotel I've ever found that gives you that option. My only problems with the TV are 1) a limited selection of channels, and 2) no in-house movies or games. There's also a Bose clock radio/CD player with a remote, a couple of phones, and a generous number of well-placed wall outlets. Wireless internet is free, fast, and easy to use. There are two free computers and a printer near the lobby on the ground floor, which seem to be busy all the time. Each room has a little refrigerator stocked with costly little sweets and drinks. I've not checked out the fitness center, but from the literature it appears to be well-equipped and available around the clock. There's a decent food and snack menu available 24 hours, and a convenient (if pricey) valet car service at the front door. Although not quite a \"scene,\" the Shoreham Bar is colorful and comfortable in a futuristic way, sort of like The Jetsons' rec room. The location - around the corner from the heart of Fifth Avenue shopping and touristing - is a huge asset. You are within easy walking distance of great restaurants, the subway, buses, Madison Ave. businesses, and Central Park. You can walk across the street to rub shoulders with celebs and the rich at the Peninsula's bar, or head a block south to attend that conference at the Hilton. If you must, Times Square is ten short blocks away (although why you would remains a mystery to me). While not exactly bustling with activity at night, this Sixth Avenue neighborhood - once a ghost town after dark - is slowly coming into its own, with a number of comfy bars, late-serving restaurants, a Starbucks and a few expensive convenience stores. On warm summer evenings, the post-theater tourists and local happy-hour lollygaggers mingle to create a diverse street scene. My only quibbles: many rooms are spacious by New York standards (and especially by comparison to the dinky broom-closet rooms at the Hudson or the Paramount), but the bathrooms are so small they look like they were designed for the Space Shuttle. Forget about two of you in there, just one of you at a time, and even then you'll be bumping into the walls. The multiple-nozzle shower is cool, but its cubicle so tiny that it's hard to keep the showerhead from spilling over onto the bathroom floor. This is a major flaw in the redesign, especially when the bedroom has enough floor space to hold a square dance. Also, after throwing all that money at the hotel's re-do, would someone at the Shoreham please please PLEASE wake up and equip each room with a full-sized ironing board? The little desktop doohickey they provide is a royal p.i.t.a. to use!

We booked our trip through TravelZoo at $199/night rate for the weekend and also stayed our 1st night through their MOMA package. While we were supposed to get early 12PM check-in with the MOMA package, we were told at 2:45 when we arrived, that our room was not ready. As far as the early check-in, I was told, \"We have no record of that. Your room is not available.\" After coming back after 3PM, it appeared the initial front staff person had no clue what she was doing while the other people in the front staff did. Our room was the standard queen room. It was very clean and an okay size for NYC standards. The bathroom had a pretty large shower which they could have probably made smaller and made the rest of the bathroom bigger. The bed was very comfortable. The room was extremely quiet although part of that had to do with the fact that we were on the 9th floor not facing the street. The room had a mounted plasma. The only complaint was that the A/C was very cold and the vents pointed at the bed. Since the room is smallish, it would tend to get stuffy if the air wasn't on, but when the air was on, it was freezing cold. Keeping the fan on (without the A/C) helped with the problem but then made the room somewhat noisy. We got free continental breakfast one morning with our MOMA package which was very nice. However, we discovered on check-out that we got charged for the breakfast. The front-desk was polite and took off the charges. The hotel is located just off of 5th ave next to all of the fancy shops. It is 1/2 block from a subway station (F line) or about 2 1/2 blocks from 2 other subway stations with more line choices. It's also close to a small supermarket and drug store.

The lobby was fun, the bar up front was open to the street and although we did not have drinks there at night, we did enjoy the continetal breakfast which had been included in our rate.

The Italian restaurant recommended by the front desk a couple doors to the East was one of the best up town restaurants I have been to and very reasonably priced, not cheap but not ridiculous.

On 55th Street between 5th and 6th so right in the centre of Manhattan and close to Central Park, Times Qquare, shopping etc etc, handy for everything. Hotel General: Trendy, modern, contemporary and boutique. The ground floor area is lovely, great bar and the free tea, coffee, hot chocolate machine in the foyer is a nice touch. The fitness room is great and there's free internet access. The bar makes this hotel (be warned though you won't get a drink past midnight). However when you get past the trendy ground floor you can see why this is a 3* - it's just a little rough round the edges, although nothing to complain about. Check In: My partner arrived before me at 3pm in the afternoon (after an 8 hour flight) and the room wasn't ready. When I arrived in at 11pm - check in was quick, and the free glass of champagne on arrival is a nice touch. However, I wasn't offered any help getting my bags taken to my room so struggled with a suitcase, laptop bag, handbag and glass in my hand as the reception staff stood by and watched. Staff: O.K but a little -- and could do with being more helpful! I say this for the following reasons: 1. Check in as detailed above. 2. The door to our room was left open by the cleaner one day (you could clearly see it was open) and when I told reception I didn't get much of a response or apology! 3. We were woken up at 3am in the morning by the fire alarm and had to climb down 4 flights of stairs on the external fire escape of the building in the early hours of the morning (in the dark and rain) - no staff were on hand to explain why and when the fire crew said we could go back to bed the staff member who had turned up could give no explanation. The same night 30 minutes later we were woken again 3.30am - forced to go down the external stairs (again in the dark and rain) and again no explanation. When I mentioned to the staff the next morning that some communication would be nice I was given just a blank stare and the guy shrugged his shoulders and looked at me blankly - he clearly didn't care! 4. At 12pm one evening I asked for a drink at the bar and was told they were closed up - I explained I was a resident and was told too bad. This place could do with some customer service training. Rooms: We had an 'exec' room - good size, clean and tidy and functional. The room did smell a little damp I thought and I think this is to do with the fact that the bathroom has no fan so the damp from the bathroom circulates round the room. But all in all great (although the cleaner did forget to leave the complementary Aveda toiletries one day)! Overall - if you get this one on deal and can avoid the staff then it's a good place to stay.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Unique Modern Place\u201d", "Author": "babyface123", "ReviewID": "UR5722886", "Content": "The hotel was very nice and very artsy!

How about the welcoming glass of wine handed to you at check-in where you are cordially ushered into the lush lounge while your luggage is swiftly delivered to your room.

I've saved the best for last...the UNBELIEVABLE friendly staff...each and every one of them as beautiful on the \"inside\" as they are on the outside. They will become \"family\" before you leave! The location can't be beat with access to everything needed for a memorable New York visit...theaters; restaurants; Rockefeller Plaza; Lincoln Center; Central Park; window shopping on Fifth Avenue; the Museum of Modern Art...You name it, you can walk to it! As a Convention Assistant, I am well aware what separates the \"mundane\" from the \"wow\" features in a hotel and, after two visits to the Shoreham, I would find it unthinkable to even consider a stay at any other New York hotel!

Unfortunately, the Shoreham isn't what all the \"positive\" reviews described. Well it turned out to be a bit of a saga. We arrived and spent the first night literally rolling towards the middle of our queen bed. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep. The bed was way too soft and actually showed quite a bit of wear. We were surprised because this is the first time we've experienced this in NYC. We try to go at least twice a year. We've stayed at the old Empire, Pierre, Barclay, Drake, to name a few, and never had any problem. The next day we asked to change room and were told on the phone that all the rooms were booked and the best they could do was to change or flip the mattress. Well, after they changed the mattress, we couldn't detect any difference. We then went directly to the front desk and asked to see what could be done. All of a sudden, 3 rooms came available! The first 2 rooms had the same problem----the beds sloped to the middle. I guess for one person it would have been okay but not for 2. Finally, we were offered a handicapped room with a king bed. Hooray, it was a firm bed that didn't show the same kind of wear. The rest of the room was okay. There were other small things that became bothersome especially if you want NOT to have to think about your hotel while vacationing. The bathroom door didn't close properly. The sink, faucets and toilet were so loose we were afraid they might come apart if we were not careful. On Sunday morning, we couldn't get the water warm enough for our shower. The bottom sheet for 2 days were too small and kept bunching up during the night. We knew there wasn't going to be a coffee maker in the room (which was fine since most hotel room coffee is so borderline anyway) and instead a coffee machine was available on the 1st floor. The problem was that the machine was broken for 3 days. We asked for a wake up call twice and we finally gave up. The first day was fine. The second morning the phone rang 45 mins. earlier then the appointed time. The third day, which we didn't request for a wake up call, we received a call at 6:30 AM! We liked the location and the staff was friendly but very young. That may be the problem---experience!

But that's ok, not their fault. What is their fault is that they don't tell you that 70% of their rooms are not refurbished and actually really small! I stayed in a unrefurbished room for 2 nights, it was awful. $300+ for this is a rip off. Smelly, old, bad soundproofed, small etc. Furthermore, I requested a non smoling floor, but the woman in the room opposite mine was chain smoking all the time, and despite my multiple complaints they did nothing... so I had to threaten the hotel to report them to relevant authorities for them to investigate the issue. Then they moved me to the refurbished wing, which is nicer, w views on the interior courtyard (awful, but at least quiet). Lastly, the room service is appalling: I wasn't able to eat the chicken, had one mouthful and tasted rotten, brerakfast was really bad, and although some of the staff are nice, most of them are either incompetent or rude (or both).

It is a clean, comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Staff was friendly and helpful with reservations, etc. We spent $400/night for a pretty small room, and apparently we had a deal b/c we booked well in advance. Similar rooms for around $6-700/night for that weekend. That seems excessive for what we experienced. The bed size was a simple double, not a queen, and the bedding was rough with pillows like cinder blocks (we did get feather pillows on request instantly...). The small size of the hotel with boutique atmosphere is a plus. Stays at the Sheraton and Hilton previously felt like a cattle car ride, whereas this stay was more personal and memorable. Note that when you roll out in the morning, the spartan continental breakfast (fruit, yogurt, and granola)--which looks complimentary--is actually $16/person, which is a bit insulting when you're paying $4-700/night. The free access to a nice espresso machine is a plus. Also, a gym will be opening soon, but presumably will require a \"donation.\" I would stay here again, but might be tempted to try a different hotel for variety.

I booked a twin room room for three people online (three months in advance) and specified that I would like a room in the new wing. On arrival, I was informed that I couldn't have a room in the new wing as they didn't have accommodation for three people there - something I found very odd considering that we were given a room with two double beds (does this mean they only have single bed rooms in the new wing???). Anyway, while the room itself wasn't too bad, the bathroom was absolutely horrible. Our toiled was blocked and we had to call reception three times to have this fixed. I know that they have since started or even completed renovating the old wing so things may be better but be aware that the bathrooms are still TINY (airplane toilet size - and no, I'm not kidding)! The reception area and lounge of the hotel looked very nice - even better than they did in the photos (!) but the quality of the rooms did not match up in comparison! Anyway, after an OK stay things really started to go wrong when after returning to London I checked my credit card bill and found TWO charges made by the Shoreham on my credit card statement. There was the correct charge relating to my stay AS WELL AS an incorrect charge equivalent to a 4-night stay. As if that wasn't bad enough, after ringing the hotel to get to the bottom of this I was told that the charge was made 7 days prior to me arrival in New York. I'm not kidding but it took over 4 weeks to get this matter resolved. I sent a detailed letter, credit card statements and flight coupons to prove that I had not been in New York at the time the incorrect charge was made, and had to make countless phone calls to a lady called Melissa Bourne. Miss Bourne was the most unhelpful person I have EVER encountered in my life. Every time I called her, she put me on hold while making numerous enquiries. At the end of every phone call she promised to call me back but did not ring me once! I gave her my work, home and mobile numbers as well as my e-mail address and fax number but being totally incompetent she did not ring me back once. It was only when I threatened to take legal action that she said she would arrange for my credit card to be refunded. However, a week later, I still had not been reimbursed. When I rang Miss Bourne again to find out what was going on she had another silly excuse. After yet more phone calls I finally got confirmation that the money had been charged back to my credit card. The Shoreham may be an OK hotel - especially after the new renovations - but I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone.

We have all traveled to the city many times and have never had a bad experience, but there is always a first time for everything. Upon arrival, which happened to be one of the hottest days in the city (and we're from Florida), 8 of us walked into the low-ceilinged, closed-in lobby of the Shoreham where losts of tiny halogen bulbs burned brightly, making the small room even hotter. It is definitely decorated in the modern, minimalist style, but the attention to comfort is minimal, too. We were offered Champagne and water from the desk clerk, which was nice, but not the big deal it is made out to be. As we checked in, it appeared they lost one of our reservations, and only one of our rooms was available. We took our luggage down the very narrow corridor to the elevator that could only fit 3 people at a time (without luggage). The elevator, too, had the bright, hot halogen bulbs in it, which I imagine in the cold winter months probably feels nice and cozy, but only made us sweat even more. The one room that was available, had a very small bathroom even by NY standards, and a window AC unit which was not working. At this point, it was hotter in the hotel than it was outside. We left the hotel and came back an hour later to learn our other room was still not available, and the first room had not cooled off at all. One member of our group discovered a hole next to the AC unit large enough to get his arm through. We were told they would send maintenance up to repair the AC unit and waited around another 45 minutes. By this time we figured out we were obviously in the \"old\" section of the hotel I had read about. We asked if we could be moved to the new section, but they could not accomodate us there. After our 3rd inquiry to check into our other room, which was well after the 3pm check in time, we decided this hotel was not going to suit our needs. We then took it upon ourselves to re-locate to a larger, more comfortable and better hotel located in Times Square. Perhaps if you can guarantee a room in the \"new\" section, and travel when it is winter, and get a really low rate, it would be worth staying in this hotel, but I won't take my chances with the Shoreham again.", "Date": "July 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!

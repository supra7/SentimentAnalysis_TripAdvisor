We ordered off of the menu but the buffet looked good. We stayed there while waiting to take a cruise. Our room was on the 10th floor. The morning of our cruise, I could look out the window and see our ship. The location was great with a lot to do nearby. Across the street is the Bayside Market Place with shopping, food and entertainment. (You can catch a water taxi to South Beach from there.) The hotel was clean and the staff friendly.

Bayside Mall is right across the street; it has plenty of food and shopping options. However, I wouldn't have selected this location if I were in town to hang out at the beach. It's about a $25 cab ride over to South Beach (or a kind of long bus ride). There was 3 of us in my group and we had one of the larger rooms with two double beds and a fold out bed. There plenty of room for us. Beds were comfortable; there was mini-fridge in the room, which was a nice convenience. My only complaint was that there just wasn't enough electrical outlets to plug all our devices in. There's a pool at the hotel, which I didn't try out.

This review refers to my last stay in February 2012. I find the location of this hotel very good, just in front the bayside and short ride from the port. I was also pleasantly surprised that downtown Miami has developed for the better, making this hotel due to the proximity to downtown, more interesting. Many shopping possibilities at downtown Miami, even a large store called Ross, which has good value for money. Across the street there are plenty of restaurants. I also like that there are live entertainers and a relaxed atmosphere at Bayside. Concerning the hotel itself, it has been renovated and it looks much better. The room was good and I had a nice view of the Harbour. There is however room for improvement. For example, the room safe should be replaced by a digital one and higher placed not so close to the floor, which is difficult to access. It should also be more control in relation to people distributing flyers at the hotel, who are they? I have received flyers advertising for food under my door during the night. I do not think this is appropriate in a hotel because it means people are just walking in the hotel unsupervised. What I have found annoying was that access to the bathrooms in public areas was only possible with a room key. Since most of us are arriving before chek inn time or leaving afer check out time, I think it is not nice to have to look for somebody to open the restrooms for you. A nice touch was the free apples and water onthe lobby. Also the free wifi. I have found that Holiday Inn Port of Miami has overall improved since my previous visits.

We arrived after dark but felt safe walking across the street to the Hard Rock Cafe for dinner.

The breakfast was really nice, being in their actual restaurant and a buffet. However, everyone else seemed to have breakfast included with their hotel, but not us. Our 2 children were free (12 and under) with our paid breakfast, so it ended up only being around $20 or so. So check that out as you book. I felt very unsafe in their elevators. Upon arrival we tried the first elevator which just sat there and didn't move. That scared us enough, so we switched elevators. The next one did the same, so the man taking room service up actually yanked on the door to get it to close! My heart skipped a beat watching him do that. The third elevator had yellow tape across it, \"out of order.\" We used the stairs the rest of the time even with our luggage headed to the taxi to go to the cruise ship. Our room was really worn down. I imagine since they are remodeling the lobby (it was gorgeous) the rooms will follow next. For a one night stay, it was fine. Just nothing to say \"wow\" I'm starting my vacation well. Yes, it was a 28.00 plus tip taxi ride from the airport.

I read on one internet site that you could leave your vehicle in this parking lot. THIS IS NOT TRUE AND YOU WILL BE TOWED! There is very limited space for parking in this hotel's lot.

Great location. Renovations were in full swing which made the lobby somewhat chaotic, but we were given a discount card for $5 off each meal in the dining room. Chaotic lobby was really not a big deal as we had no intention of hanging out in the lobby anyway. We requested an early check-in and a room on a high floor with a view of the port. Both requests were granted and it was particularly fun to see the cruise ships in port. The room itself was fairly basic, but clean and spacious enough. We were able to walk across the street to Bayside Marketplace and grab some dinner and take in some live entertainment. There is a CVS a block away which was perfect for replacing the sunscreen that security confiscated from our carry-on bag at the airport.

After several times of logging in to only get booted a few mins later, I remembered I was supposed to be on vacation. I took it as a sign to log the hell out and relax. Great decision. We ate breakfast in the dining room and it was a fairly good breakfast. We intentionally went downstairs with all of our luggage, ahead of the rush, as we had heard that things get really hectic around 10:00 - 11:00 AM - crowded elevators, pushing, shoving, gnashing of teeth, shedding of blood and the occasional beheading.

The carpet I am sure was clean, but I rather kept my slippers on. Bathroom was nice and clean -albeit small. You could tell the hotel was very old from the mortar-work and the paint - a few spruce-ups to that and it would be just fine. Perhaps it is just aesthetics, but it does make a world of difference. But the beds were very neat and comfortable, the coffeemaker worked, the tv was fine and there was hot water. The closet was large and we are always happy for an in-room safe. There is a sweet small Italian restaurant downstairs Marina Bistro Cafe. Nice for breakfast and ravioli. The location cannot be beat! The Bayside Marketplace is less than two minutes walking and filled with places to eat (a food court and restaurants: http://www.baysidemarketplace.com/), have a drink in the evening and live entertainment at night.

The hotel is undergoing construction and hopefully gets ready soon. The hotel is very well located, in front of an outdoor mall where you can do a lot of shopping and find plenty of restaurants (hard rock cafe, cuban, steakhouse etc). If you drive be ready to pay $13 a night for your car....and arrive early as there's only space for about 40 cars in the lot, which, by the way, closes at midnight (so if you don't arrive by that time good luck trying to park). The rooms were clean, neat, just your standard room as any hotel.... However, the quality of sleep was terrible: The windows are not soundproof and the walls and doors are so thin that you can hear everyone walking by at night....One of the nights this was horrible as three persons arrived late (2 AM) and woke all the floor because of their talk on the hallway while they were trying to open the door (I saw 3 other persons with their doors open trying to get these guys to shup up - horrible). The wireless internet in the room didn't work at all and it was S.L.O.W ---------- aweful since I actually had to work. I went to the business center and it was worst: The system log me on and it started a timer (20 minutes / person) but it took me 18 minutes to log into my email account (that's how fast it was)...by the time I was starting to check my first mail the system log me out and I was so upset that left the business center immediately....So business center: 0 stars. On Sunday night around 8 pm, while I was at the bar, the power went off in this hotel: the rest of the block had light and power but something failed here (maybe because of the renovation/construction?) and we were without power for almost 1.5 hours. Since the staff didn't know what was going on and kept repeating that the power was going to be back pretty soon, and I had to work on presentations but couldn't because there wasn't any power or internet, I decided to check out and move to the Hilton which had rooms available (by the way, rooms here at the Holiday Inn were $190/night and only $159 at the Hilton; so think about that when booking).......But before I was able to do that, I had to go to the CVS two blocks away, get a flashlight, and go to the 6th floor to start packing.....and oh boy, I was scared now for my safety as none of the EXIT signs or emergency lights was working at all...the halls were in complete darkness. The other travelers thought I was with the hotel because of the flashlight and I had to help some people to get into their rooms during this time. After I packed and carried my bag 6 floors down I check out and got out of there ASAP.....(By this time, it has been 2 hours without any power and was very concerned that some of the folks there were going to be there in complete darkness for the whole night). The staff was very worried about the travelers during this situation but they were really unprepared for it....safety was a concern for me and at least this nothing but a power outage...but what if there is a fire in the middle of the night?

All in all i'd say the size was \"fine\". One problem in our room was the bathroom door didn't stay shut. It didn't even line up with the doorframe. I'm guessing this has something to do with how buildings slowy shift over time, but this should be fixed. In a hotel room a bathroom door that doesn't close isn't acceptable. Also, one of the towel bars fell off when I touched it. I carefully hung it back up - something that i'm guessing every guest and housecleaning person has done for a long time. Cleanliness-wise the room seemed decent. If looked in corners behind doors I could find a little grime, hair and stuff like that....but nothing too crazy. The main thing that hindered the room was the simple fact that it came across as dated. So clean or not...it was never really going to wow anyone. We were right next to the dreaded ice-machine room but I have to say I heard nothing. So either it was a dead night on the ice-getting front...or the room has decent soundproofing. Either way, the ice nor anything else woke us up...so kudos to that. The concierges were friendly...as were the front desk staff. None of the staff in the restaurant were overly pleasant though. Overall i'd say it's a decent place to lay your head for a night. But if you're staying for any more that 2 nights and/or want something \"nice\", this probably isn't it.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFALSE ADVERTISING\u201d", "Author": "luv-2-cruise71", "ReviewID": "UR96083729", "Content": "I booked this hotel for the night before our upcoming cruise in March.

On the morning we were checking out we went downstairs to get breakfast before heading to the ship. We were only out of the room for about 30 minutes. One of us went up to the room first and walked in on a man who said he was \"in the wrong room and thought it was his friends' room.\" When my friend went to the phone to call the front desk the wires were ripped out so that the phone had no dial tone. The rest of us then got up to the room right as he was trying to call and he told us what happened. He then ran down the stairs to find the guy and/or go to the lobby and tell the hotel to call the police. We had a watch, ipod, laptop, and cash stolen, a total of about $2000. It took the hotel a while to call the police and the front desk manager kept asking my friend if the man was wearing a uniform (as if asking did he look like he worked here). He was able to give the police a pretty good description of the guy. While dealing with the police, we figured out that the only two cameras in the hotel, in the front lobby and the back staircase to the parking lot, were not working. Our room was on the top floor, right by those back stairs where the guy ran out. When we went to check out after dealing with all of this for about 2 hours, the front desk manager informed us that she did not have the authority to give us a free room. She said that only the general manager could do that and the general manager already spoke with the police and had left for the day. I asked her to call him so that I could talk to him, but he did not answer his phone. She said that she would temporarily not charge the room, but about 2 weeks after the stay my credit card was charged the full amount of the room. I have called and left at least 5 messages on the general manager's voice mail to call me back and he has not made any attempt to do so. The front desk manager from that day did however call me back after I had left a few messages and asked what I needed. I told her that I had already talked with her and she said she could not help me, so I would like to talk to the general manager. She said that he was gone and she would tell him to call me. He still has not and I continue to leave messages for him. When I explained the situation to her she seemed to not remember the guests that stayed in the hotel and spoke with her all morning in January after being robbed. It's scary that a hotel would not remember a robbery, especially when she is the one who spoke with us and the police. I have since tried to leave more messages for the general manager and have still not heard anything. This was a horrible start to our vacation and the worst part about it is that the hotel did not even care that people staying at their hotel had their room broken into and were robbed. They only seemed worried about making sure to cover up any possibility of fault. I would advise anyone looking for a hotel not to stay here.

We arrived at approximately 3 PM and were treated with a lot of courtesy and efficiency. They had a small sign at the check-in desk that was kind of funny considering how cold FL has been. \"Sorry about the cold weather. Please be advised that our hotel isn't heated.\" There was no need to use the AC that night and it was quite comfy. Our room was on the 5th floor facing the Bayside Market and port. We could clearly see two Carnival ships berthed there. The Bayside was right across the street and VERY convenient for last minute shopping and finding a good place to eat. Just 2 blocks from the hotel was a CVS in case you forgot sun tan lotion, etc. Our room had two full size beds, was clean and comfy. Check in and check out was handled with a smily by the desk personnel. The hotel offered a breakfast buffet on Sunday for just $12/pp. They had a great selection of food with friendly staff. Unfortunately, they didn't have a shuttle to the pier so had to take a cab for $5. Not too bad and we weren't jammed into some sort of shuttle with lots of other people. Others have mentioned how slow the elevators were. Both were working perfectly for us and were rather quick. The 3rd elevator was a service one and not for general use. To sum up, a nice, clean, relatively inexpensive, convenient place to stay pre-cruise.

We asked for, and were given, a high room, 9th floor overlooking the bay & port. We found the hotel to be fine, albeit dated in structure.The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms functional and again clean. The large bed was as good a bed as we have ever slept in .The room overlooked Bayside Market, and the Port in the distance. It was lovely to awake the first morning and look at the cruise ships whilst the sun rose. We didn't eat in the hotel as we wanted to eat in Bayside, but we looked at the menu and the choice appeared quite adequate and several guests ate both breakfast & evening dinner. The prices were in keeping with many of the local restaurants and if you are a Priority member you will get $5 discount. It is possible to order food from delivery services as flyers are put into each room and local calls are free. We bought a bottle of wine and nibbles from Walgreens ( a couple of blocks to the right as you come out of the hotel. There is also a CVS Pharmacy closer, but we didn't use it so cannot comment ) and drank it in our room before, and after dinner, whilst enjoying the views from our comfortable chairs. We agree with others that the elevators could be a problem, but we have to admit that we didn't encounter any. There is a sign stating that during peak times, 10.30 - 12.30 the elevators will be busy as check out time is 11.00. We were fortunate that when we checked out on both occasions we did not experiemce any problem. The reception and concierge staff were all very pleasant and helpful. On our post cruise stay, we arrived early,( 09.15 to be precise ! ) and were able to check in our cases to a secured luggage room and also complete all paper work so that when we returned later, we just collected our key card from reception. The location of the hotel could not be better for the Port and as we said, is opposite Bayside Market which hosts numerous shops, restaurants, of varying standards and bars. There are free open air concerts twice daily and we sat and enjoyed various performances which would put many a so called artist to shame. The best was probably a Brazilian group, or should we say,a female singer with a backing male group. This is obviously a very popular performance with many locals turning out in great support for them. On our last day, we stayed 2 nights post cruise, after going to South Beach ( SoBe), by 'C' or 'S' bus, the stop is opposite the hotel ( $2 each, no change given ) we decided to spend a couple of hours by the pool, which was a great sun trap. Although we did not swim as the water was too cold, we did sit at the side with our legs in the water as the sun was hot. We arrived at the pool about 14.30 hours and until we left at 16.30, we were the only people there, although those who used the car park at the side of the hotel walked through the bottom end of the pool area......no real problem.The concierge staff obtained a taxi for all those who required one and although we did not experience any problem getting to the Port ($12 ) or airport ( $25 ), trying to get a taxi to take us from the Port to the hotel ( $10 ) was a slight problem. Most of the taxi drivers want a long fare, such as the airport from the port, so we had a bit of a hassle getting a driver to take us to the hotel, but we did manage after a few failures. Listening to others in the line at the port , we found we were not alone, but we all managed to get a taxi eventually, just be persistent !! We have stayed at various Holiday Inns in the past and although this building is not the most modern, we really could not justify any complaint apart from the sound proofing in the rooms. We had a connecting door, which we do not like, but our view was too good to give up, and we could hear people in the next room, but to be fair, could not make out what they were saying, it was mostly laughter we heard. This hotel seems to be used mostly by cruise passengers, mainly due to it's location and therefore the rush seems to be as stated in the elevators. On our second departure there were no cruise ships in port, so check out was trouble and hassle free. We can only say that our perception of the place was favourable and really, we wanted a clean and comfortable place to stay for a few nights, not a fortnight, and this hotel fits the bill.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cAn Expensive Mistake\u201d", "Author": "cmg2101", "ReviewID": "UR57167684", "Content": "We stayed here in December after Christmas. I was disappointed in this property in almost every facet. To begin with, the parking. If you are driving there, a small lot in the back is all you have access to. It is always filled and if you park there, drive to the beach and return there is a good chance there the spot will be gone. The security guard attempted to shake us down for some extra $$ to \"hold onto our spot\" which I found to be quite awful. The pool is in the shade almost the entire day. The photo online does not do it justice. The pool area is small and sandwiched between the parking lot and the restaurant. The elevators are slow enough to get you frustrated. Really. Also there are no stairs that they allow you to use. This was an issue when we were there. I repeatedly asked if we could use the stairs and were met with rude, short answers. Well Murpheys Law --- we got in an elevator that got stuck and the fire dept had to rescue us. There was no apology from management and the whole episode was quite surreal. I kept saying, I am paying for this? There were bugs in the bathroom. Small little guys walking around. When I commented there was no reaction. Then we had the pleasure of visiting friends down the way at another hotel equidistant to the American Airlines Arena in the other direction. Oh my. For the same money this place was 400 times nicer, with a pool deck with a bar and bartender which faced the sun with no obstructions. Buyer remorse? Yes. Will I be returning? No. I wrote to management about the elevator, bugs and parking. I got a auto generated response.

The hotel also has a swimming pool and a business center, and I also believe there was a gym. All these were free of charge for guests. The main problem with the room is the noise, the walls seems paperthin, so everytime someone talks in the hallway outside or close their door, you can hear it like they stood next to you. Not a huge problem for us, but for someone more sensitive I belive it would be. Another problem we experienced was that our bathroom wasn't clean, there were stains all over it and the last guests used toiletries were left, resulting in us having to clean the tub before using it. Of course we could have called reception and asked for a better cleaning, but since we only stayed for one night we didn't.

We were looking for a decent hotel near shopping and dining and since Bayside is directly across the street it seemed like a good choice. We booked using the Advance purchase rate and when the rate dropped the hotel refunded us the price difference with no hassles and no problem. (Hilton did not extend the same courtesy but that's the chance you take when you book that rate type.) We booked a King Suite which was very spacious and more than adequate for our needs. It had a living room separated from the bedroom by louvered doors, a small bathroom (hardly any counter space), a separate vanity area (again, small), and small closet in the bedroom. The entryway into the living area had a small kitchenette with a mini fridge (worked wonderfully!), small sink, microwave, and plenty of shelf space for storing food etc. There as also a coffee maker with all the necessary supplies to get your morning caffeine. I believe the King Suite rooms are corner rooms - we had a view looking north on Biscayne Bay and another view looking directly across the street at Bayside. I had read reviews of hearing music from Bayside on weekends but we didn't hear any at all. There were some street noises and I did hear the tour bus that stopped in front of the hotel every morning at 5:30 to pick up passengers for Orlando day trips, but other than that it was a great room in a great location. Our room was only on the 4th floor so we were not high enough to see more of the port area and the ships. We could see most of the Royal Caribbean ship but not any of the Carnival ships. There were a few signs of wear and tear in the hotel; most notably in the hallways with old, tired looking carpet and in the bathrooms where there appeared to be layers and layers of paint and patch jobs. This wasn't anything that bothered me, just an observation. We used the hotel gym daily while staying there - it is small but had all two treadmills, 1 bike, an incline bench, and a multi-purpose weight machine for chest, arms, and legs. It had clean towels, a water dispenser, two TVs (one quit working after the 1st day), and a balance scale. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant every morning. If you are a Holiday Inn Priority Club member you receive a \"gold\" room key that entitles you to $5 off any meal in their restaurant. (They only serve breakfast and dinner.) There is a continental buffet for around $8.99 and a full buffet with hot selections for $12.99 (drinks included). My husband had the buffet once and said it was good. I ordered off the menu every morning and would go back just for that experience. The cinnamon french toast was amazing! We requested the same server, Raquel, every day since she was so friendly and provided great service. An extra touch she provided was sending us extra drinks in \"to-go\" cups when we were leaving. Keep in mind that Miami restaurants already add a 15% gratiuty to the bill. We didn't use the pool (directly behind the restaurant in a walled courtyard) or pay for parking since we didn't have a car. There is a concierge also which we didn't need. The elevator cars are a bit on the small side but we didn't ever have to wait too long for an elevator. Taxi's were easy to get just outside the front entrance. There is also a new CVS drugstore just a block down the street to the right of the hotel. There is a McDonalds behind the hotel (not such a clean one but we ate there...) a Subway around the corner and then dozens of places to eat at Bayside.

We didn't have time to use the pool area, but it looked safe and clean. There was an ice and soda machine on our floor and would think they would be on all floors. Ice buckets, glasses, coffee maker was provided in the room. If you expect consumate luxury then go and stay at the Mandarin Oriental, but if you are happy with a large clean comfortable room (with free Wifi) and friendly staff then I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for a pre-cruise stay. The Byside Marketplace accross the road has bars, restaurants (Hard Rock, Bubba Gump Co., etc...), shops and stalls.

The positives: directly across the street from Bayside Marketplace and close to Port of Miami. If you have port view, you can see your ship in the morning. Perfect location for cruisers. Easy to get a taxi in the morning. The negatives: The hotel is getting older. Many people paid less for the much nicer Intercontinental a few doors down. The staff wasn't too friendly or accomodating. There is plenty of noise from the street below and the music at Bayside Marketplace. Housekeeping was lacking.

I booked kind of last minute, so I ended up paying about 160$ for a 'king bed room with queen sleeper sofa'. For me as a solo traveller I felt the price wasn't exactly cheap. But the room although looking old was very spacious and clean and would very comfortably house a family of four. Or even four grown ups, if you cosy up a bit. So for families or people say on a party trip this is an affordable, very conviniently located place to stay. Plus I am sure if you book a little more in advance you're bound to get a better deal. My check in was a very smooth and friendly affair. And although I stayed on a weekend and the hotel was obviously brimming with pre-cruise guests my room was ready despite me arriving early. My only complaint: The aircon although I turned it on warm was freezing at night as the temperatures had just dropped and couldn't be turned off. They also put some water and a few chocolates into my room, which was a nice touch. The room also has a coffee maker, a microwave oven and a fairly big emtpy fridge and even a freezer, again ideal for families. So if you're going to be on the cruise of your life and you want to start or end it in style, go to the Intercontinental across the street.

I had booked the room about 3 months in advance and got the Sail Away Package. I had requested a room on the highest possible floor and with a view of the Port. I was not disappointed. Our room was on the 8th floor and looked out over the Bayside Market and the Port of Miami. Our room had 2 double beds, usual table and chair, desk and chair, and coffee pot. There was a large window in which we could watch the people coming and going from the Market as well as watching the ships leave and enter the port. This was the reason I had booked this hotel. I wanted to see the port and to watch when the Victory came in. Check-in was a breeze and there was a bellhop to help with our luggage. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and provide menus for those restaurants that provided delivery. There was a business center that offered free internet access, however this did not work the day we checked in. Before checking out, I did step into the business center and was able to check online the status of the ship and departure time due to Hurricane Wilma making it's way to Florida. Breakfast was great, a wide variety of things to enjoy and the wait staff was very pleasant. Was fun to watch and see all the people who were staying there getting ready to cruise. After we finished with breakfast, the wait staff offered us foam cups to take coffee and juice back with us to the room. I have read some complaints about noise, but did not hear any. Our room was located near the end of the hall so that may have been the reason. The only noise to speak of was the firework show that happened Saturday night about 9:30. This did not bother us and we actually enjoyed it. There was a RCCL ship in port that was getting ready to set sail so it seemed like a great send off for them. As, I said, the reason for booking this hotel was to watch the ships come in. About 3am I woke up and decided to take a peak out the window, sure enough, the Carnival Valor was arriving. Talk about fun to watch as it made it's way in to the harbor and turned around before docking. I got up several times and was able to see the Carnival Victory as well as RCCL ship arrive. Check-out was again a breeze with several cabs waiting at the front door. We checked-out about 9am as we like to be to the port early. This hotel is not a newer hotel and there are signs of wear, but it is in good shape and was clean. I did not smell any weird smells, nor saw any bugs and I am one to take notice of such things.

They placed the luggage in a secured room. We went across the street where there is the bayside mall. We were able to listen to free music at the pier and have our pick of many places to eat like Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gumps. If you go to the Hard Rock and are a AAA member you can get 10% food and t-shirts. They have boats where you can take a 1.5 hour boat ride to see the sights. I think it was about 15 a person.

The king sized bed was comfortable enough. There was a safe in the closet and the AC worked fine. There was a seperate sitting area with an additional TV and telephone. A microwave, fridge and coffee maker. They provided popcorn, bottled water and coffee at no charge. My only complaint about the room was the toilet. It rocked back and forth. This was a livable problem so I didn't care. We were given a voucher for a free buffet breakfast the next morning. The dining room was crowded so I'd suggest that you would go earlier than we did which was around 10am. The food was decent. They had hot food and danish as well. You could order from the menu if you wanted. AT this holiday inn as at many kids eat free. We thankfully were able to travel without our kids this time so it didn't apply to us.

They had a nice exercise room with two treadmills, an elliptical trainer and a bike along with some weights and a scale. The equipment was fine but the readouts on the elliptical were not correct. Our cab fare to the cruise ship pier was less than 10 dollars and was a very short ride. All in all our stay at this hotel was very pleasant and comfortable.

We were on the top floor (10th) but not facing the harbor. We faced the pool. The room was not large, but well appointed and had a nice little full bath that was very clean with granite counter top, wall mounted hair dryer and tub/shower. It all looked recently renovated.

Just walk outdoors from the baggage claim and the stand is right there next to the cab stand. We will definitely stay at this hotel again prior to a cruise.

There is also a Walgreen few blocks down if you need something else. 9th floor doesn't have a vending machine or an ice machine but just go down one level and you should find it easily. I agree with the other critics.. you can hear the slamming of the door. If that doesn't bother you, then this is a place to stay. For less than $100, there's nothing to complain about. We paid $10 going to the port the next day and taxi is so easy to get. They are always outside of the hotel waiting for passengers. I guess they know that people use this hotel to go on a cruise. I really can't say anything else bad about this place cuz we only stayed there for one night. We never tried the restaurant because there are plenty of restaurants across the street and the atmosphere down there is more lively. I would definitely come back to this hotel for our pre-cruise stays.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cGoing on a Cruise? - GREAT Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Zacloed1", "ReviewID": "UR3899784", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in large part based on the reviews we found here. We stayed for 2 nights before our cruise. Check-in was hassle free. The room was smaller, but really - it was nice. Granite countertops and nice shower head in the bathrooms. Huge closet (all those cruise bags, right?). Bayside was right across the street - there were numerous restaurants - including Hooters, Bubba Gump, Chilis. There were also traveler shops, food court, standard shopping, etc. Near the hotel is also a Walgreens for any last minute things you need. Taxis are out front waiting to take you to the cruise port.

We booked the hotel thru the Holiday Day Inn website, and requested for a room away from the elevator (from the reviews here about the noise) and 6th floor and up. However, we got a room that's on the 5th floor, right across the elevator! We requested a room change but was told that the only room that's away from the elevator has no view of the port...so we stayed. The hotel room is decent, great for a 3 star hotel. Sheets & the washroom are clean, about 30 channels on TV, and got all sorts of things you'd expect ie. coffee maker, safe, phones, etc. However, one of the phones didnt work but there're 2 in the room so that's ok. Also, one of the lights didn't work so it made the room darker. Although we stayed right across from the elevator, the noise didn't bother us at all - just a slight \"ding\" sound when it arrives. However, I agree with others that the doors are very noisy when shut, and the walls are very thin that you can hear your neighbours. However the real noise is from the traffic below - at 5th floor with windows shut, I'd still hear the cars passed by below...as well, there was noise from the toilet - as if it flushed by itself. Had to close the lid & bathroom door...took a long time to fall asleep. If noise didnt bother you, this is a great place to stay. Price is reasonable, and the location is great - Bayside is just across the street..2 minute walk. Staff were very friendly and helpful too! $23 tips included for a cab ride from MIA. On safety, it's better than expected - it was a concern since we were 3 female travelling. But we arrived at around 6pm and went to Bayside, walked back at around 9pm...the market & street were lively with lots of ppl still, so dont need to worry about walking back at night. However, you do see homeless ppl on the street (as with every cities' downtown) but it's not as scary as I thought. All in all, a great place for pre-cruise but mind the noise! Would recommend staying at least higher than 5th floor.", "Date": "September 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "WNY, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in Downtown Miami\u201d", "Author": "Michina", "ReviewID": "UR3813725", "Content": "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Port Miami in the middle of August. This hotel has an excellent location right across the street you have one of the most visited spots \"Bayside\". The hotel is nice, not too fancy but has all of the elements to make it a 3 star hotel. The staff is pleasant and \"Hugo\" the Concierge is very helpful... The rooms are big and some are renovated. Beware, if you reserve here try to ask for the rooms that face Bayside they are more spacious and updated. I've stayed here in June and was given a room facing the port. Those rooms were much nicer than the rooms on the back. This time around, they put us towards the back of the hotel and the view was nothing to write home about. Also ask for King size beds... the double rooms have full size..who fits on a full size nowadays??? We paid $120.00 for the night, that included breakfast for two.. so in the middle of August thats a great deal. Also bare in mind that parking is extra.. I don't understand why, but that is Miami for you... The parking is limited on top of that so you may not have a spot secured if you arrive to late.. oh and they also close the gates after midnite, so ask if you will be arriving late. There's much to do at night right across the street so you may just want to park and walk... they have bars/ restaurants/ and live music every night... The hotel's pool is not big, if you want to get some sun you need to wake up early as the sun disappears quickly over the building. Some of the rooms need improvement, but overall clean... the hotel has a great location and price which is better than staying at the hotels in SoBe.. Oh another thing if you are not driving, save your money on cab fare as they will charge you about $25.00 each way to take you there. Ask Hugo, the concierge, about the bus they only cost $1.50 each way and that is a great savings...", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPretty decent....But......\u201d", "Author": "Jeff_at_Greenhills", "ReviewID": "UR3675137", "Content": "My friend and I chose this hotel due to its close proximity to the port since we were going on a cruise the next morning and because the Bayside Marketplace was across the street offering shops to explore and several nice restaurants to eat at. The hotel was nice. We were very pleased with the room itself, especially the bathroom. Just off of the lobby is a nice dining area and bar. I had a delicious breakfast the morning we checked out to leave for our cruise. Our ONLY complaint was that it was very difficult the sleep because of all the slamming hotel room doors. All of the doors have automatic spring closers, which cause them to slam shut. We stared at the ceiling for hours unable to fall asleep because of all the noise it was making up and down the hall. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for this I would give this hotel 10 out of 10 points.

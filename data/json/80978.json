This was not one of the best overnight places to stay in S.F.The building had a very bad smell, my husband described it as having an onion in a headlock. Luckily there was a Walgreens across the street and we were able to buy some disinfectant/air freshener spray. We stayed at this place because a representative from AAA recomended it. I have two small children and our room had large windows with no screens. I was very tense about having a toddler in this room because she kept wanting to look out the window. Also Lombard Street is very noisy at night making it hard to sleep.There was no A/C so the room was very stuffy. Another family we came with had no hot water in there room for about 20 minutes. There was no continental breakfast in the morning only coffee and juice.Our family was very disappointed and will never stay at this place again.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR285556828", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Lolo05"}, {"Content": "Horrible Customer Service!! Horrible room!! My wife and I arrived the evening of June 13th only to find a hole in the ceiling of our room with water dripping from it. I went to the front desk to inform them of this and request another room. I was told flat out in a very rude tone that no more rooms were available and if I didn't want that room I should go somewhere else. I was also told that, for the rate I was paying, what did I expect!! Unbelievable!! I told them that the room was totally unacceptable and, since it was late and we didn't know the area at all, I asked if they would help us find another room. I was immediately told a flat out NO and that we should leave in a very rude tone again. After a very brief shouting match concerning their totaly lack of customer service, we left. Fortunately, we found an excellent room at the Chelsea Inn just a couple of blocks from where we started. They had fantasic large rooms and unbelievable Customer Service at only a few dollars more than the dingy, dirty Alpha Inn and Suites. Finally, we ended up getting a refund thru AOL@Travelocity after they called the Alpha Inn and Suites to confirm our complaint....", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR857444988", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "tfourment"}, {"Content": "Terrible       disguting chair", "Date": "Jun 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551801986", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "puce3"}, {"Content": "Bed bugs bed bugs bed bugs!!!!!

The guy on the front desk was friendly and helpful (even if English wasn't his first language), and he gave us a huge room, from which you could see downtown, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.The main building is accessed via a locked gated door which you access using your keycard. The room was clean and had a comfortable bed, walk-in cupboard, bathroom, TV, telephone, fridge, microwave, table and chairs, 2 sofas, and coffee maker. It was about 4 times the size of the hotel room my husband stayed in last time he was in SF. The noise wasn't too noticeable considering we were on Lombard Street! The main negative for us was that there was no safe, despite the website saying 'safe in every room' and the keycard saying 'keep your valuables in the safe'.Some other things to note: There's no lift \u9225?so make sure you can carry your luggage up and down 3 flights of stairs! Breakfast consisted of 1 small chocolate muffin. However, there's a Walgreens right across the road, and a diner further up Lombard. If you're not a fan of thin towels, bring your own!The area seemed fairly safe, and the location is good \u9225?just walk down Divisadero and you end up at the marina district. If you're feeling energetic you can have a very pleasant walk 2 miles to the Golden Gate Bridge (turn left), or Pier 39 (turn right). Having researched SF hotels on Tripadvisor, we weren't expecting to get a lot for our money (especially on Fri/Sat, booking only a few days before our stay). While the whole place would undoubtedly benefit from a spruce-up, we had a comfortable stay.

He looked on a sheet of paper and said we were not on it and then turned around and walked back into the back room and would not come out again when I buzzed again. I returned to our car and my wife called the hotel. This same man answered the phone and told her that they had canceled our reservation because we were not there at 8:00.

Hands us a sheet with no explaination (apparently guest registration sheet), asked us to fill out information and sign first before he starts filling out the length of stay and room rates (which of course were higher than the web reservation). When I mentioned that the rates (only approx. 10 dollars more for two days in comparison to web reservation ) will not be accepted by us and that this is a problem he should take up with EconoLodge Headquarters, he said plain and simple ...then go away, we don't serve you, you are rude, go away! Leave now! At no time were we rude. At no time did we agree to pay more regardless of the amount. We asked for the registration sheet to be torn up and he refused. Bottom Line:1.

He said he could store them in the laundry room across the hotel complex. I asked him if he could show me where that was and he refused. When I said I was uncomfortable leaving the bags somewhere he would not show me, he tried to assure me that it was locked except when the employees were doing laundry (this did not seem all that secure). I asked again if he could store my bags in the office, and he refused, and then said, Now I won't store your bags at all. I said What? He said, Take your bags with you, I won't help you. We went back and forth like this a couple more times, until finally I had to beg him to take the bags, and even then, I had to lug the bag with my computer in it all around with me, since I decided only to leave my garment bag.

First of all, they let us check in much earlier than our check-in time which was extremely helpful for our itinerary. The staff there was the most friendly and hospitable team of people I have ever encountered in a hotel environment. They genuinely seemed happy to [\u2026] have us as guests. The rooms themselves were extremely spacious and accomodating. They had a refrigerator which was great since we had brought snacks. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable and the bathroom ammenities were outstanding. Every time we ran into someone they seemed super happy to help us. The complimentary breakfast was incredibly ample and was much more than muffins and juice. They had waffles, variety of breads and fruits. Cereal, juices, coffee, etc.The internet speed is so fast.

Room 212. Upon check into #212, there was a missing lightbulb on desk lamp, and the clock radio was not working. Called front desk and someone came up to replace the bulb & plug in the clock radio \"behind\" the bed. Saw some kind of small insect fly in front of the TV screen that night. Did not realize until the next morning when I went to shower, that there was NO shower curtain, once again had to call to have someone bring it up. No Wash cloths or Bath Floor mat, had to go down to front desk to get them. Noticed water dripping on the floor at/under the sink, leaky fixtures, reported and was finally fixed TWO (2) days later. The Tub/shower fixture was corroded & difficult to operate, the wallpaper was peeling & had Mold traces on it in several places. I made coffee each morning, and the Coffee maker was not cleaned the 2nd day, and it also broke. The little girl who was at the front desk was No help at all just told me I had to call the manager during the day. Unable to get any replacement. On Feb. 26th, there were TWO (2) Barking dogs (German Shepard & Chihuahua) in room 223 across the hall. The replacement towels were \"worn\" and frayed. The electronic keys did not work on 2/27 so I had to go back downstairs to get them reactivated. Then on 2/27 & 2/28, there was very little/ NO water pressure for the sink faucet. I left it on so \"housekeeping\" could see it & report it but it NEVER got fixed. I also bumped up against the wall by the sink and a Tile actually fell off the wall & onto the floor!!! When I got a \"form\" letter a week later stating they were \"sorry\" for what happened and they would credit me $85.00 (which was LESS than what I paid per night with tax). I called the property & tried speaking with the G.M., and he would have nothing to do with me and threatened to add the $85.00 back onto my card, he began yelling at me over the phone, so there was no way to have a civilized dialog or discussion. Tried calling Choice Corp. Guest Relations & not tooo much help there either as it has taken some time for someone that can actually DO SOMETHING to call me.

We picked it because it was the highest rated hotel within our budget. I wish we had increased our budget. The non-smoking floor smelled like very stale cigarette smoke and our room smelled very bad. Basically it stunk! It took us until the morning to figure out what the smell was. The shower was backed up (for how long, who knows, probably quiet a while) and the smell was rotting water, almost a sewage smell from the standing water in the tub. We decided to not use the shower at all and left as early as we could to get out of that stinky room. Upon checkout (we stayed one night) we told the front desk about the room odor and they didn\u2019t offer us any refund (we didn\u2019t ask) but they did offer us a can of juice. They were basically very nice at the front desk and since the hotel did not look full, we probably could have changed rooms if we ask, but we didn\u2019t ask \u2013 entirely our fault there. The location of the hotel was dismal. It was in an industrial part of town, all gray and brown. Though, it was literally right on Hwy 10, so it was really easy to get going to our next destination. The breakfast was the typical Fruitloops, Cherios fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs and a waffle making machine for fresh waffles. Would I stay there again? Only in desperation or if it was really late at night, I could get a room that didn\u2019t smell and it was just a place to sleep for the night.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cSeedy\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4726172", "Content": "If you check in after 11:45PM you have to do it through a bank teller-like contraption while standing on the sidewalk....except the blinds of the window were down and I never actually saw a person on the inside.

Small by LV standards, about 9 floors. One block from Planet Hollywood, Harley Davidson Cafe, Cosmopolitan Hotel, etc. We paid only $630.00 for two people for airfare (Southwest) from Salt Lake plus four nights lodging. Our room was very clean and very attractive---apparently remodeled recently. We were on the fifth floor, right at the tops on the palm trees on the west side, and loved having birds chirp us awake in the mornings. Another plus is that the window actually opens, albeit only about 4 inches, so you can get fresh air instead of using the AC. If you want more flesh air, bring a small Vise-Grip or set of square-head nut drivers, and you should be able to remove the screws holding in place the wooden bar which prevents the window from opening fully. The outdoor pool was great: very clean, with a jacuzzi, loads of pool towels, showers and bathrooms. The pool does get shady about 3:00 p.m. thanks to the tall hotel to the west. (A plus if you want to avoid skin cancer; a minus if you want a tan.) Also, the staff was great. I went to iron a shirt, and found the face of the iron had some sticky substance on it. I found a maid in the hall and gave her the iron. Three minutes later, she was back with a brand-new iron, still in the box. Another example: On my way to the pool one day, I went to the ice machine on the ninth floor. It konked out after giving up only a cup of ice. I told the desk clerk and when I returned from the pool 30 minutes later, the ice machine was fixed. Our room had two queens, a kitchenette, flat screen TV, steam iron & board, and in-room safe. In the lobby is a concierge who can book shows, etc., a small selection of groceries and drug store items, two computers, and a TV room where they serve coffee etc. in the morning. A tennis court next to the pool. For us, we loved NOT having a casino or restaurant in the hotel. (No food smells or obnoxious slot machines, either.) The only negative was the typical hotel styrofoam pillows. If you want quiet, convenient, attractive, friendly, STAY HERE!!!! ----signed DT, your picky traveler from Salt Lake.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Red Deer, AB", "Title": "\u201cA comforatable, quiet boutique hotel just off the exciting Las Vegas Strip!\u201d", "Author": "CanuckRedDeer_AB", "ReviewID": "UR126497987", "Content": "Our family party of four adults stayed at the Carriage House Deluxe Suite Hotel from March 4 to March 7, 2012. The unit was located by researching Trip Advisor. At that time the Carriage House was listed as 6th of over 250 hotels in Las Vegas. This surprised us and made us wonder about the rating. We need not have worried as the Carriage House lived up to its high billing. It\u2019s a fabulous place to stay! Small compared to some of the 6000 room behemoths but very quiet, comfortable and friendly and great value for the money. We were upgraded from a one bedroom, sleep four unit, to a two bedroom sleep four for the price of $99.00 per night. The units had recently received a renovation and looked like new. One unit had a sleep comfort queen sized bedroom while the room we were in had a Murphy bed which was a great upgrade from the standard sofa-bed. The Murphy bed was very comfortable. Both units were equipped with a kitchen with new appliances and had updated flat screen TV\u2019s. Complimentary Wi-fi in the units and computers in the hotel lobby were available. Although air-conditioned, the AC units need to be balanced so as to have an even flow of comfortable air. We either got warm air or freezing cold air. This really wasn\u2019t an issue for the time of year we were there but could be in the hotter summer months when the AC would be on for great length of time. Coin operated washers and dryers were located on each floor. Maid service is provided each day. In-room safes are located in each unit. A small maintenance issue in one of the bathrooms was dealt with very quickly. A heated outdoor pool is available to guests as is a fitness center. Complimentary parking is provided. Although there isn\u2019t an on-site restaurant, a small Mini-Mart with snacks and personal items is available. However, the Carriage House is only a 5 minute walk to the Las Vegas Avenue with a wide variety of casinos, restaurants and shopping opportunities, as is The \u201cMiracle Mile\u201d in Planet Hollywood. It is also just across the Avenue from the New City Center development. The Las Vegas Trolley, which runs just behind of the Carriage House, is available either at the Bally\u2019s/Paris or MGM stations for easy navigation up or down the Avenue. The Carriage House Deluxe Suite Hotel will certainly be considered on our next visit to Las Vegas.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cVery Please\u201d", "Author": "highdesertbadger", "ReviewID": "UR126334222", "Content": "I stayed here years ago and wondered how the property had stood up to time.

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this hotel. This recent trip is my second time staying here. The first time I stayed here, they gave me a loft type set up where the bed was separated from the kitchen by a seating area. This time, they gave me a larger corner unit where the bedroom has its own door and is completely separated from the kitchen. The unit was clean and spacious...I can't think of any complaints except for the fact that the wifi was slow. I was on the 7th floor, though. The hotel does have nice amenities: like a market area downstairs (convenient if you don't want to walk to CVS or Walgreens), a gym (though limited b/c there are only a few machines), a whirlpool, swimming pool, and tennis court (I did not try these out). There was also a computer area downstairs where you can print out your boarding pass for free. Anyways, I think Carriage House's best attribute is its location. It's less than a block from Las Vegas Blvd, the Strip. I've never stayed at one of the Strip Casino hotels, but being the type of traveller I am, The Carriage House is enough for me.

I mean, come on, you have the entire LV strip to choose from, full of hotel rooms that range from Circus Circus to Mandarin Oriental. Yet, you keep coming back. You weigh the price with the amenities, you think about the dreaded parking at mega resorts, the atrocious resort fees, and the long walks back to your hotel room. Perhaps you're a seasoned Vegas visitor, or it may be your first time and you're smart enough to get the most from your dollar. Regardless of your situation, the Carriage House serves the needs of smart travelers. Snuggled in a small lot between the Signature MGM Grand and the Marriott Grand Chateau on Harmon Blvd. east of the strip, the Carriage House is a diamond in the rough. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and you'll probably miss the entrance the first time you visit, but a similarly equipped room at any CET or MGM property would easily cost three times as much. You can read the other reviews to find out about the details. I like to list the pros/cons that others miss. Pros: - At check-in, you are given the option to disable pay-per-view billing. Seriously, how common sense is this? This is the first time I've actually seen a hotel give you the option to SAVE money. - I was given an entry into a $50 drawing when I checked in. I didn't win, but if I did it would have been nice. - The WiFi is FREE and is FAST (youtube friendly). (but, see below) Cons: - No deadbolt on the door. This isn't a huge deal since the hotel is very secure, but I'm just so used to it that I tend to ding any hotel that doesn't have these. - The WiFI, while fast, also employs a really absurd content firewall. I'm an avid target shooter and frequent various forums about such, and these sites were all blocked the day after I visited them on the Carriage House WiFI. - The room's AC/Heating system is central (not a unit mounted in the outside wall), but is quite loud. The reason this is an issue is, if you're watching television, you'll naturally want to turn up the volume. Since you are in a hotel with rooms that share walls, this tends to cause a chain reaction of noise complaints and whatnot. Overall, this is a great choice for the self-reliant, money-saving traveler.

Being able to store and cook cereal, snacks, milk, cheese, fruit, and even frozen meals (MUCH cheaper than eating out all the time!), was really nice... especially nice when you want a snack at 11pm while watching a movie (hot popcorn and a soda or glass of cold wine is great!)

Person standing in doorway can see the whole room including the bed and if you are not properly attired you have nowhere to hide. -Realised after a short while that not much natural light coming from the one window, had to have lights on during the day time. -The bathroom was very small with a shower that you had to lean back under in order to wash hair, and I'm only 5'3\" and don't know how my husband managed! Once sat on the loo, you can't shut the bathroom door as there is not enough room, so remember to shut it when you first go in! -The air conditioning unit was so noisy every time it kicked in, that if we were asleep it woke us up with a start. It doesn't help that the ac unit is in a locked cupboard in the small studio. We asked for it to be checked in case there was something wrong with it. We don't know if it was checked, but we did request and receive a plug in box fan to at least move the air in the room. The window only opened about 6 inches but we understand that is for safety reasons. -The kitchenette area was perfectly adequate, although a freezer would have been nice. Plenty of crockery and cutlery enough for 4 people. -The bed was firm and we both slept really well on it. The pillows were a bit high for me, but I found undoing the zip on the protector cover under the pillowcase released a bit of a vacuum - strange I know but it worked for me! -Housekeeping was really good and came in to make bed and empty rubbish, change towels if needed on a daily basis. They even did our dishes for us a couple of times, (there is no dishwasher) which they are not supposed to do. -A washing machine and tumble dryer are located on each floor, costing $1.50 and $1.00 respectively. Single dose Tide for the washing machine available in reception for $1 and 2 Bounce sheets for $1 -We loved the swimming pool and especially the hot tub, both of which we used after dark, it was a shame it closed at 10pm as there were a number of times we could have really done with the hot tub after a long day. -Check in and check out was a breeze. We didn\u2019t use the concierge or go for the usual timeshare meet and greet, and there was no pressure, which was lovely. -Everyone we met at the resort, employee or visitor was very pleasant. We had a no smoking room, but there was a nice clean smoking area on the back patio with table and chairs, which is where we met and chatted with some really friendly people. -If you want to spend some time away from the strip the following are all great places to visit, and can be done in day, some may be a long day, but worth it!

There was an uncomfortable smell in the room, an odor of stale cooking, which is unfortunately a problem when you stay in a hotel where guests are cooking in their rooms. The small kitchenette was nice, but not very functional. I guess someone could use the stove and oven, if you needed to, but it is not very practical. The hotel staff at the front desk and housekeeping were very friendly. However, they keep trying to sell you timeshares while you are there. When we checked in, they asked us if we wanted to attend a timeshare meeting in the morning for free tickets to a show. We all said no, but they called us again at 9:00 the next morning (it is Vegas after all and we were still in bed) to try to get us to attend the timeshare presentation.

I paid $59 for my room, which is great for the location. All in all, not a bad place to stay if this is your first time to Vegas or if you are a non-gambler.

This property has a nine story building with a lobby, two room-key-secured fast elevators, a tennis court and a pool. TCH was booked as an RCI timeshare rental. I used a Laundromat, not the laundry room available on each TCH floor. Heavy construction on the east and north parking lot area did not affect my stay. On site there is no restaurant and no gambling. I had a rental car and free parking was always available. I last stayed at TCH in 2005 and have stayed at 5 other Las Vegas timeshare rental properties. Pro FRONT DESK \u2013 The staff was competent and friendly, and internet savvy. No checkout surprises. LOCATION - 5 minute walk to the best part of strip. The nearest casinos and shopping were City Center (Aria and Cosmopolitan), MGM Grand, and Planet Hollywood. ROOM \u2013 Everything was in good condition. My 8th floor no-smoking one bedroom corner unit was big, almost too big. Bathroom with tub and shower. Dressing area with sink, walk in closet, iron and ironing board, and free safe. Bedroom had king bed with lots of pillows. Three windows in the bedroom. One window in the living room. Dining room table and 4 chairs. Telephone. KITCHEN - Full refrigerator, sink, dishwasher, toaster, no ice maker. Microwave and stove top with no oven. Coffee maker. CLEAN \u2013 daily maid service, if you want it. TECHNOLOGY - Flat TV in the living room and bedroom. The living room TV had composite video input. In-room free, unsecured, login required, wireless G with good performance (all rooms had wired DSL in 2005). Each WIFI device needs a login ID. The bedroom had a clock radio with iPod dock tethered to the wall. There was a DVD VCR in the living room that I did not use. The lobby had two free internet terminals and a color printer that worked. HVAC \u2013 The AC, heat and thermostat worked. Con NO BALCONY \u2013 Unfortunately, even some of the new timeshare properties in Vegas don\u2019t have balconies. The windows could be opened a crack, but otherwise you are in a box with windows. NO LIVING ROOM RADIO \u2013 I wish the tethered radio iPod dock in the bedroom could have been moved to the living room. TECHNOLOGY \u2013 The two flat screen TVs displayed analog low-def TV and often at the wrong aspect ratio. DIM LIGHTING \u2013 Lighting (except kitchen) was dim incandescent bulbs. I should have replaced them with bright bulbs.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cgood value\u201d", "Author": "georgiaapple", "ReviewID": "UR111522408", "Content": "Stayed 1 night.

It is one block closer to the strip than the Signature. The location is good if you prefer to be a bit away from the busy crowds on the strip, yet close enough to walk there whenever you please. Blissfullly, there is no casino, therefore it is quiet and completely non smoking. We had a one bedroom unit, in case a family member would visit. There are two different floor plans for the one bedrooms. We chose the one with the bathroom easily accessible from either the living room, with pull down murphy bed, or the bedroom with king bed. This unit had a small kitchen area and a small living room-everything rather tight, but adequate. The larger one bedroom, with larger kitchen and dining area, and larger living room has a bathroom with a snazzy stall shower; the bathroom is right off the entry foyer. The units are decorated simply ; some are in need of updating, but everything was in working order and the bed was comfortable. The lobby is austere, has a check in desk and a stand that has some individual snack items for sale. There is also a small business center area set off to the side with a computer and printer for guests, right next to the desk selling timeshares (no pressure; no one ever bothered us.) There is a small fitness room, but only two of the three machines were working. Aside from the bags of chips or pretzels for sale, there is no food available at t his hotel. There is an outdoor swimming pool and hot tub which we did get to enjoy before leaving Las Vegas. Check out is early; we had a late flight. The staff was kind enough to allow us to use the pool facilities, even though we had checked out of the room. There is a bathroom by the pool to change into one's clothes, or one can use the bathroom off the lobby. Parking is free for hotel guests. WiFi does work in room, but it took quite a bit of effort to get it working properly. There was a lot of communication back and forth with the front desk before it was operational. We much prefer staying at this type of hotel in Las Vegas; no casino, but near the strip for eating and shows. We love the elegance of the Signature at MGM and The Hilton Grand Vacations at the Flamingo. They are more expensive though. The Carriage House was a pleasant stay for the one night, and reasonably priced for a 1 bedroom during what ended up being a very busy time in Las Vegas. We ate at Mon Ami in the Paris Hotel and Sea Blue at MGM Grand. Both were good. In September we saw Cirque du Soleil's performance of \"KA\", which was the most spectacular show we have ever seen. This trip, we saw Cirque du Soleil's \"O\". It was very expensive, no two for one tickets as a tripadvisor review talked about, but had some wonderful effects and amazing circus acrobatics,synchronized swimming events and high diving, all on one small stage. I would recommend seeing \"O\" first, and then KA.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Las Vegas Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NewZealandMolly", "ReviewID": "UR107303936", "Content": "The hotel is 2 blocks from the strip and is very quiet.

We spent 3 nights there and on the last unfortunately there came a group of at least 6 who did not stop drinking and talking loudly going in-and-out of the room directly opposite to us. Lucky that it's a suite and although it was very noisy at the kitchen area, we could not hear them when we slept in the bedroom. Not sure if there's free WiFi in the room but I just could not use it. There are two PCs at the lobby and they work perfectly OK. We bought a $7 day pass for the deuce bus and we had no problems travelling often up and down the Strip. Yes, it sometimes took more than 15 minutes for the wait. As long as you plan for longer travelling time (you would better in Vegas), it's OK.

I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel. Being a former Housekeeping Manager for a pricey resort on Cape Cod, I can ALWAYS spot something unclean from a mile away- but everything was well taken care of at the Carriage House. The only thing I would say its that certain things were a bit outdated. For example, our room had a great new bed and flat screen t.v, however, the bathroom seemed in need of remodeling. But for the price- and in Las Vegas- I could not ask for more. During our stay we felt as though we had the place to ourselves, never heard any sounds from anyone else, and the lobby never got to crowded - never a wait for using the computer, or needing to speak to a hotel representative. This would not hold true at any other Vegas hotel in my opinion. We also felt very safe, as there were security and personnel working at all hours. I notice many comments on here about the location. The location is perfect!! We were easily able to walk to and from the strip all day-- very very close. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis in my knees and ankles, so if I think it is an easy walk- it must be! The other great thing about the location is that the BEST sites on the strip are throughout the middle of the strip- which is where Carriage House is tucked behind. When you check-in, ask the representative the short-cut to the MGM- us and some other couples learned about it after we had been there a number of times. We stayed in a studio with a partial kitchen. This was the perfect size for two people to stretch out and relax after a busy day on the strip.

She even negotiated with Budget so we could get picked up at the hotel to go to the rental car place--and drop it off at the airport later without extra charge. We checked into a lovely room, had nice attention from staff, and the location is superb--a street off the strip, so it's a little more quiet. But within a quick walk to everything. My only complaint was a noisy fan in our room and the fact that we couldn't leave the bathroom light on at night as a nightlight for our kids because the light came with a loud extractor fan automatically. Other than that, a very nice hotel and nice stay.

Two of us had been to Vegas before so we knew what to expect. We were looking for a fun, relaxing weekend away in Vegas. Overall, I was not thrilled with the Carriage House. Make no mistake, this is a very utilitarian hotel. If that's what you're looking for... then you won't be disappointed. Location: The Carriage House is located on the corner between two very busy streets and about 3 blocks from the strip. It is across the street from a mall and a few hotels. Although it's not bad for walking... it is impossible to get a cab from there. Because of the location, we took a cab to a few places (for shows and for night life) and we always had a wait. We had to wait for almost an hour for a cab back to the airport in 100 degree heat. Not fun! Room: The room we had slept four people: two on a bed and two on a pull out couch. I was on the pull out couch... which bowed in the middle and made my back hurt. The room had a kitchen and a small bathroom. Everything was very basic and terribly out of date. Overall it was clean and got the job done. Ammenities: They do have a pool on-site and it does the job. Just don't be fooled by the photos... this is a very small pool. There was no wireless internet... we were given a cord for the modem but couldn't get it to work at all (one of us works with computers for a living so it wasn't us!). They did offer a few computers downstairs that you could check your email on for free. Useful for email but not useful if you need to do any work. The workout room is very small and only offers a few treadmills. People: The women at the front desk were always a little rude and curt with us. Other hotel guests were friendly and helpful. Although having a kitchen was convenient, I wouldn't stay there again. There are so many other inexpensive places to stay on the strip that are much nicer, offer more/better amenities, and are more convenient.

I agree with other reviewers that the staff was great - friendly and helpful. We had a one bedroom studio suite and it was as big as my first apartment. There was a living room separated from the bedroom by a vertical shade. There was a small dining table and then a pretty good sized full kitchen. It was very quiet there, we never heard anyone in the other rooms, even though they were full. If you're looking for glitz and glam, go somewhere else. This was a very clean, comfortable apartment-like setting, and we really enjoyed it. We didn't opt for a grocery store, but didn't really need one (they said it was $15 each way by cab). The lobby had lots of food items at surprisingly reasonable prices, things like eggs, milk, bread, peanut butter. Everything else we needed we got at the Walgreens which was a couple of blocks away. The rooms have coffee and they'll give you more if you want. I'm pretty picky about coffee, and I thought it was really good. They have a lighted tennis court and very nice pool. They give you the tennis equipment to use, and have basketball too. They have a big selection of dvd's and videos, also complimentary. They're mostly older titles, but some good ones. Someone else complained about the internet, that the cord kept you and your computer at the counter. They gave us one that was about 10 feet long, so we could use it anywhere in the room. We walked everywhere, but if you don't like to walk, you should probably get a car. It's not too far off the strip, but it is a couple of big blocks, and most of the casinos are a mile or two away. The Planet Hollywood shopping mall is almost right across the street. When we first arrived, they sent us to the concierge to 'enter a drawing', which was code for 'sign up for a timeshare talk'. The guy was really nice, but we were tired and just wanted to put our stuff down and he wouldn't stop talking. We did sign up for the timeshare talk and it was not bad at all. It was about an hour with a very nice, non-pressuring woman. She asked us questions about what we already own and what we like to do, and it was clear that we were happy with what we have. We told her we weren't going to buy anything more and she was very gracious about it. For doing that, we got a $100 voucher for a Brazilian restaurant across the street. TIP: What they don't tell you until after the presentation is that the $100 doesn't include alcohol or the 15%gratuity. The dinner buffet is $49 each, so there's your $100, plus whatever you drink, plus tax and tip. We thought that was pretty misleading. So here's what we did: We went for lunch. The buffet was $29 each, which left $40. We ordered three entrees to go and took them back to the room. Our bill came to just under the $100, and we paid another $20-25ish for the tax/tip, but had a couple of extra meals from it. (very good meals!)

The Carriage House is an older hotel that needs a lot of work. My husband and I had booked an eight-night stay, only to cancel seven of those nights, in favor of the Paris Hotel on the Strip. The most overwhelming issue my husband and I encountered when we walked into the Carriage House's tiny, claustrophobic elevator and our floor's hallway (floor 8) was the smell of what I can only figure must be air deodorizer to mask possibly the scent of times when Carriage House allowed smoking. If that's not what the smell can be attributed to, I'm not sure what it is. It is very unpleasant. The room we stayed in was dingy, for the most part. The decor needs updating, as it gives off a dark, yellowed feel to everything, but more than anything the rooms need to be cleaner. The small bathroom in our king bed suite, which might possibly win the award for World's Narrowest Doorway (good thing we aren't fat!), has very old faucet fixtures that look like they need a better clean. The grout of the handicapped shower, which I assume comes automatically when you get the king bed suite, is very old and moldy, if not completely wearing away. The Carriage House is really not nice enough for me to want to stay, and I don't even think it is good value for money. For only $10-$20 more a night, on average, you can stay at one of the nicer Strip hotels for a longer stay of, like, a week. Add to this the fact that, while the Carriage House does sport an unbelievable location, it's not that great at the moment (as of Oct 2009), due to the extensive roadwork being done on Las Vegas Blvd. With pedestrian walks being blocked off in numerous areas, it can actually be quite tricky to navigate back to the Carriage House from certain places without walking a long distance; you get trapped in pedestrian walk areas that have been set up for construction purposes. In other words, what the Carriage House has most going for it, its location, isn't worth the money, either. The Carriage House could be a good place to stay, if they update it more and clean it a bit better.

The lobby is fresh and inviting. There is a small pantry of items that was enough for us to avoid a grocery trip. The location is as expected. It is directly across the street from the side enterance to planethollywood's end of the Miracle Mile. You must walk about 200 ft to the stop light to cross. There is heavy construction so the side walk is torn up, but they have created a temporary walk way. You can continue the full block to the Strip, or walk through PlanetHolly wood to get to the strip. We usually walked down the back street along the monorail line to the back enterance to MGM. This is about 200 yard easy walk. We then could easily walk through the MGM to NYNY, Excalibur etc. The main concerns I had with our stay was the quality of the room. We had a 1 bedroom suite. The furnishings were fine and the beds comfortable (as comfortable as a sofa bed can be). The linens were of good quality. However, the upkeep on the room itself was poor. The wall paper was old. The ceilings are very low (especially in the hall way). The kitchen was very poorly stocked. We only had one spoon, no forks, no bowls, a couple small plates. We used the cooking pots as bowls. The room overall was dark and didn't feel inviting. The bathroom/shower is very small The biggest issue was that the A/C wasn't strong enough to keep the room cool. We were just two people going to vegas for a vacation. However, if you are bringing a big group of people, this would be a fine hotel as the layout of the rooms allows for multiple families to stay near each other and have the ease of a kitchen.

We also had a 1 bedroom apartment which was large and could sleep 4, the bathroom was huge with everything you will need with 2 tv's. The hotel staff are excellent, including the concierage lady and the reception staff, they were happy to help anytime for taxi's and car hire. Also when I asked for a member of staff to fix my bath tub, a man came up within 5 minutes to fix the problem! The best part about the carriage house is that there is no casino, so you dont have to walk through a huge casino to check in or go to the pool.

The staff was always friendly and courteous, and greeted us as we came and went and made us feel at home. The rooms are very large - like a typical one bedroom apartment. They feel a bit worn out, but still are well decorated in slightly worn and outdated furnishings. The kitchen is reasonably stocked with cutlery and glasses. The cleaning staff didn't clean dishes - which isn't unusual in suites we've stayed in. The rooms did a good job with noise, but it was still possible to hear the monorail going by - and one night someone nearby had their TV turned way up and we could hear the muffled sound through the walls. Another reviewer mentioned theft - and, while I don't doubt him/her at all, we didn't have any problem with this. We left both of our laptops out while we were out during the day all four days and didn't have any issue with them or anything else going missing. Overall, the rooms are a bit aged looking, and it's definitely not a glamorous hotel, but the rooms are large and comfortable. Parking wasn't a problem. It's easy to walk everywhere.

For US$100 - $120 per night you can't go wrong. Even a laundrette on almost every floor which proves extremely useful. Location was ideal - one block back from the strip. Close to Planet Hollywood and Paris Casinos. Reception was fantastic - the staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful when we had questions. Louis Mas on reception is one of the best operators in the business.

I bit on a $69 rate over the Thanksgiving weekend after seeing the overall excellent reviews of this property. Carriage House is certainly reasonable at a low rate such as $69, but there were some quirks and the hotel is somewhat dated. Although the word \"suite\" is often thrown around to describe CH rooms, they're essentially standard size hotel rooms with a kitchenette (and no counter or seating associated with the tiny kitchenette either). Bathrooms are standard tub/shower combination; in my room, the drain was super slow and I needed to have the property come fix both the drain and the shower head, which was of an annoying needle-spray type. While the property did fix both issues, the slow drain should have been picked up by housekeeping or via the hotel's room PM process - it's not something a guest should have to report. The room is a late 80s vintage, with blond woods, floral print bedspreads and almond fixtures. The AC in the room was loud and loved to kick on obnoxiously, run for 2-3 minutes, then kick off with a loud sigh. Watching TV during an AC cycle meant constantly turning up and down the TV volume to compensate. When the AC was off there was definite noise from traffic and the monorail on the south side of the building. These days, Carriage House is virtually encased on all sides by large high rise condo buildings, so there is no real view from any room. TVs have been updated to flat panels, but there is no HD content available, and the TVs are recessed too far inside the armoire \"hole\" to allow for reasonable viewing from anywhere other than the bed. Hallways are low-ceilinged with old style drop ceilings, leading to a claustrophobic atmosphere. Most annoying was the inability to connect to the room's wired internet access. While many wireless signals (for a fee) were easily acquired, the hotel's system seems finicky on certain laptops such as ThinkPads. The hotel responded to my complaint by bringing up one of their HP laptops, connecting successfully, and then washing their hands of the issue by directing me to the wired internet provider. Two phone calls and 25 minutes on hold later, the CSR claimed their \"keyboard wasn't working\" and could I please call back later. I ended up paying an additional $12 to connect via one of the wireless providers. Given the overall value proposition, at $69 weekends this property can still be a reasonable choice.

The hotel lobby was under construction when we were there, but even so was still clean and well kept. Security in the hotel was also very good as you need a keycard to get in to the hotel after 10pm and you must have a keycard to use the elevator.

I told them that we had to have a non-smoking room (the problem was we were leaving on a Saturday and the system would not let them give us a room as they were booked for the weekend).

We had a room with a separate bedroom and a pull out sofa and a roller bed. the kitchen was like new with all the new utensils it offered.We enjoyed cooking two of the nights we were there. We also found that this hotel was great and well suited to families as there was no casino. it was one big block to the srip and very central to most things. Miricle Mile shops a block away.

First, Management at the Hotel claimed to have no knowledge of the upgrade.

Second, it became very apparent that the Carriage House had booked the second week of the 1 bedroom 1 bath style accommodation with another party. As such, they were unable to move us as requested. In order to dissuade us, front desk staff and management advised us that we would have to clear our room, wait in the lobby for six hours with our luggage, and see if the room was available, notwithstanding the fact that we had written confirmation from Interval International.

Like so many people I did not want to pay $200+ per night for a room in the new mega -deluxe \"resorts.\" Going midweek is usually much cheaper, but they only charged an additional $27 for the Saturday night. I stayed at this hotel about 7 years ago and was happy to see that it has been kept up very well. With all the construction going on around it, the pool is closer to the hotel and the parking lot is smaller. But that is all for the better. This is a great location. Only 1 block to the New Planet Hollywood shops, 2 blocks to the strip. Rooms were very clean and staff was great. They took time to answer any question in detail. I like having the kitchentte in the room. I'm not a big breakfast person so the first day I stock up on some food. It is great to have a relaxing morning instead of having to get dressed just to go get something to eat when you get up. I had read some reviews about construction noise so I took ear plugs with me. Maybe it was just my room location, but construction noise was not a problem. I thought the noise would be bad while trying to relax by the pool, but that didn't bother me either. The air conditioner would be my only minor complaint...that was annoying. So I was glad I had the ear plugs. This is an excellent value for the size of room and location. It is by no means elegant or luxurious. It is a very good hotel. I hope it doesn't get squeezed out by everything going up around it.

Very conveniently located near the strip, it has free and ample parking. There is no casino in this hotel, so access to your room is quick and easy. All access into the hotel is monitored and the keycard must be used to enter the building after 10:00 p.m. and at all times to access the elevators. Great security! We had a king room with small kitchenette. Perfect for our needs! Came with everything we needed to cook simple meals which was a nice break after eating out for seven days in row. The hotel supplied everything needed in the kitchen, including coffee pot, micro, stove stop, fridge, towels, dish soap, etc. We received a room on the third floor away from the construction which is taking place around this hotel at an amazing pace. We were only disturbed once by the construction noise. Otherwise, it was a small buzz in the background, but nothing to disturb us. The room was immaculate. The beds were comfortable and had a cotton waffle-weave blanket instead of the velour blanket all hotels seem to use. The front desk employees were always so helpful. The pool was open until 10:00 p.m. and we enjoyed that several evenings after a long day on the strip and before we went back out for evening touring. They have a snack vending area which supplied us with ice cream treats at a very reasonable price (75 cents to $1.25). After paying $3 for bottled water on the strip one day, I could really appreciate the value of a ice cream treat for 75 cents!!) I would recommend this hotel whoeheartedly to anyone.

We enjoyed being near the Strip and almost across the street from the nonsmoking Desert Passage (Aladdin/Planet Hollywood) shopping area, which also gave us an alternative walking route to the Strip, connecting us right to the crosswalk to the Bellagio. One evening we walked from the Carriage House to the Monte Carlo, and down to Treasure Island. This is all within about 1 mile of the hotel. For our family, being able to park right outside, not having to walk through a casino, and having a kitchen are all strong recommendations for staying at a small non-gambling place.

The first week we stayed at a casino/gaming hotel (see my review about the Orleans Hotel & Casino) and upon our return from a trip to the Grand Canyon, we checked into the Carriage House. The staff were very friendly and even remembered that it was our wedding anniversary (I had mentioned it when I did the booking). We had booked a suite, and it was absolutely wonderful. There was a box of chocolates awaiting us on the dining table with a card which we thought was a very nice touch. The sitting-room area was really huge, with a big comfy sofa and large coffee table. There were 2 tv sets in the suite, one in the bedroom and one in the sitting-room area. The bedroom has a king size bed with good quality linen and spare bedding in the large closet. There was also an ironing board, iron and vacuum cleaner! There is a round dining table with 4 chairs, a breakfast bar with 2 stools and a fully equipped kitchen with full size oven, electric hob, dish washer, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. All the cutlery and crockery were spotless, and the frying pans, pots, bowls etc were reasonably new and in very good condition. They supplied us with dishwasher powder and washing-up liquid, tea towels etc. The only fault I could find with the suite is that the bathroom was small compared to other places we had stayed at, and there was no bath but a large walk-in shower instead. We weren't planning on spending more time than we had to in the bathroom anyway, so it wasn't that much of any issue. There is a pool and hot tub situated just across from the lobby and you need to use your room key to access the pool area which means nobody can just wander in from off the street. The pool was heated so we were able to use it even though the pool area was shaded for the large part of the day. There is also a tennis court, and although we did not use it personally, we did see some couples enjoying a couple of sets. The Carriage House is within easy walking distance of the Desert Passage at the Aladdin, where there are loads of shops and places to eat. A few more minutes walk takes you to the Strip and for those wishing to buy show tickets, it is advisable to get to the large Coca-Cola shaped ticketing booth around 10.15am. The shutters open at 11am but you will find that lines start forming very early. There is currently building work going on EVERYWHERE in and around Vegas, I have never seem so much construction work happening at the same time. This also means a lot of dust, heavy traffic and congestion in certain areas. There are also two large construction sites adjacent to the Carriage House and the workers start very early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper you may be disturbed by the noise, so much so that you can ask for a free pair of ear plugs at the reception desk. I did find, however, that after the 3rd night I got accustomed to the noise and it did not bother me that much after then. Otherwise there is really nothing to find fault with in this hotel. There is a laundry room with coin operated washers and dryers, and there is an internet access terminal in the lobby if you do not have your own laptop/notebook to connect in the room. I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who does not wish to stay in a busy, smoky, gaming hotel.

However, there is some concern over the construction noise going on across the street (in that whole area).

The room was large and comfortable and very clean, well stocked with towels of all sizes and shampoo/lotion etc. The pillows were great, very fluffy for hotel pillows and the beds were firm but comfortable. There was lots of closet space, an iron w/ ironing board and enough hangers for both of us and our multitude of outfits for going out. The shower was GREAT! Hot water and lots of water pressure, better than my shower at home. They even had a real bathmat in the bathroom, not just the towel ones. The kitchenette was nice for eating leftovers for breakfast (PF Changs in the Aladdin has take-out which is great for next day or late night munching). Overall I was very pleased and will most likely be staying there again when I go back to Vegas with my husband. I would highly suggest this place for families with kids.

Our first impression was that the studio room was beautiful. The king sized bed was comfortable and the decor was excellent. No flower drapes or bedspreads in sight. The kitchen was well-equipt. The strip was definately in walking distance, 5-10 minute walk, but found that there was much more action at the other side of the strip, so we tended to park our rented vehicle at a hotel and then tour the closest ones each day (parking is free at all hotels). Problem with the hotel? There were a few. First, housekeeping is definately lacking. Hairs were left in tub and on sink numerous days. Carpet needed a good shampoo, and I don't believe it was vacuumed more than twice for the week we were there. I spilt some pop on the sheets day 3 and they weren't changed until day 5. Second, though most of the staff where very nice, one night we decided that we would like to rent a movie so we called the front desk. The lady told us that we decided to not have access to movies when we checked in. When we told her no one meantioned movies to us, she basically said that we were lying because it was right in her computer. (why would we do this?). Anyways, we thought it would be pretty easy to flick a switch, but I guess not, since she rudely told us to turn the tv off and wait a few minutes. We did this, the movie didn't come up, and we gave up, rather than call her back and deal with her. Thirdly, the pool really lacked cleanliness, used towels were constantly piled to the brim of the bin, ash trays not emptied, etc. Construction seemed to be a problem for some guests but not us, since we were on the other side of the building. The nicest thing about this hotel was the lack of casino and the fact that you didn't have to walk miles to your room. It was very quiet and we did not hear any noices, people, etc. in the hallways late at night or anything like that. Overall, a good hotel if your looking for a cheaper stay in Vegas, but don't expect anything glamerous.", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "fanman1965", "ReviewID": "UR4117280", "Content": "Stayed at this fantastic hotel with my husband in november 2005 for 5 nights.

The rooms were very clean and well furnished as was the hotel in general. The staff were very friendly and helpful and check in took minutes as we were the only guests checking in at the time. This was great as during our stay we witnessed check in queues at other hotels which were miles long! The hotel is minutes from the strip and a great location. The construction work around the hotel is still ongoing but we were on the other side of the hotel so we never heard a thing. It is worth requesting a quiet room when booking. There is construction work going on all over Vegas so hard to avoid really. The hotel had no casino which suited us. Walk into the lobby and straight into the lift, no having to walk miles through a casino to the room. I have stayed in strip hotels previously and can honestly say \"never again\". The carriage house offers a fantastic little hotel in a great location for less than the strip hotels, most of which are no were near the standard of the carriage house! Lastly i couldn't leave without a mention for Joey's bistro in the hotel. It tends to close around 9 if not busy and most diners seem to go for dinner then head out so its busy earlier on and well worth booking a table at. Superb! We dined there twice in our 5 night stay. On one visit we met a couple who live in vegas who were regulars and knew the waitresses by name. So if the locals dine there its good enough for me.

There was easily enough room for the four of us and the facilities were excellent; microwave, cooker, fridge, coffee maker, dishwasher (very important!) etc. with dishwasher liquid and coffee re-filled each day. Both the bedroom and the living room (where the kids slept on a large sofa bed) had TV\u2019s, meaning we didn\u2019t have to watch Sponge Bob all the time. We were on the second floor directly facing the construction site at the rear. Ear plugs made a big difference, but it was still possible to hear the beeping of the forklift trucks early in the morning \u2013 I couldn\u2019t hear anything else though, not even the kids! However, it must be said the construction of the extension to the MGM is very much ongoing. One building was nearing completion, whilst another was only just beginning, with the piled foundations about half complete (poured concrete, so no pile-drivers) but probably another 9-12 months to go until full completion (my wife gave me a hard time for taking an interest, being a civil engineer!!). The staff are very professional and friendly and were always on hand to help. There was never more than one or two people being served at reception at any time, but always two staff on duty, meaning you never had to wait long to be seen. We arrived at 5.30pm on a Saturday and check-in took less than 10mins. We needed a car for a couple of days, so the staff arranged one through Budget (they actually pick you up at the hotel and take you to their depot 10mins away) which was $20 dollars cheaper than the same quoted by the Budget counter around the corner on the Strip and we also saved on the higher airport tax! Being a family with kids (11 and 8) meant we couldn\u2019t enjoy all the slot machines and gambling (one of the reasons for choosing the Carriage House, since we didn\u2019t want to walk though acres of machines to get to our room). What we liked as a family was the Desert Passage at the Aladdin, with its shops and family friendly restaurants, which really is, less than five minutes walk away. The kids liked the swimming pool which was never too busy. The pool is across the hotel access road (very quiet) in front of reception, but you need your room key to get in, so is quite safe. Also, next to the pool is the tennis court, which the kids really loved (they have smaller racquets if required) Since it's elevated, they managed to lose all their tennis balls, but the staff didn\u2019t seem to mind \u2013 they probably enjoy going into the swimming pool to retrieve them! Other things we liked about the Carriage House; laundry on every floor with washing machines and driers (essential for families or those with few clothes); internet access ($5 for 20mins or $10 for 50min) \u2013 We used it every day with 10mins being the longest wait; Joeys Bar \u2013 it was busy with a wedding taking place when we visited, but afterwards was quiet enough for everyone to get a window seat for the great view. Kids meals were good value at $3.99 and we enjoyed ours, especially with a bottle of house wine (a good accompaniment to the ear plugs!!).

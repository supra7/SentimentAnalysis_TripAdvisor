It was a routine weekend stay in Indianapolis for me from a Friday night to a Sunday morning. I was not made aware that the gym closed at 10pm leaving me only 20 minutes (at best) to do anything before the deadline. The pool towels are held hostage at the front desk so be sure to grab some before jumping in otherwise you will be soaked and freezing through the unheated glass encased breezeway that connects the poolroom to the hotel. I never got to enjoy the pool or hot tub anyway since the hotel was so insanely over crowded compared to the facilities available. The free breakfast is non-existent unless you get out there on the double, by 9:20am everything is gone (save a lone brand muffin) and the cleanup crew is working diligently. The main hallway stinks of mildew and the carpet visibly needs replaced. On the day of checkout (9:30am) the maid knocked twice very quickly and was halfway in my room through the locked door before I yelled 'hello' and she retreated apologetically.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cClean rooms is always a plus!\u201d", "Author": "TexShel", "ReviewID": "UR125144362", "Content": "I had a nice stay.

A couple of notes. We were here over superbowl weekend. So we paid way too much for this room (although I can't think of a price I could pay that would make me feel good about the stay), and the hotel was sold out. Some of this might not apply as much if there were fewer people in the hotel. Clean: The sheets and towels seemed clean enough, but the rest of the place was pretty gross. The blanket on the bed was really beat up, and there was a chair in our room that looked like it came from someone's dorm room. I'm not exaggerating. I added a photo of it which if you zoom in you can see it. The black mark at the top is ground-in dirt from people's heads. The arms and seat were stained with ground-in dirt and other unidentified things. Pretty disgusting. Staff: Really friendly and helpful. To be fair, everyone in Indiana seems this way. It was a really nice surprise to find so many friendly people around you the entire trip. I would imagine most hotels in this area would have friendly, helpful people so while this was a plus, I'm not sure it would be unique. Facility: Pretty run down in general. Dingy was the word that kept coming to mind. It has a pool which seemed unique for hotels in this area. We didn't use it. Location: It is located in the north-northwest corner of the indy circle. It was an easy drive into the city (25 minutes on highway), but if it wasn't superbowl w/e you can stay in the city if you like. Noise: Unbearable. Let's start inside the room. The refrigerator goes on and off about a dozen times in the night. When it starts up, it sounds like a car starting. Same with the heat or A/C. Once they are going they are just a very loud hum, but the on/off is pretty loud and they are not synchronized so you will have to deal with this from one of them about 20 times an night Outside the room. In a hotel there is always the occasional noise from the hallway or the slamming of a door, but this hotel in particular seems to have the thinnest walls/doors I have ever encountered. Every noise makes it into the room. We had to call the front desk all three nights because our neighbor liked to fall asleep with the TV on. It doesn't have to be loud because once things settle down, we could still hear him breathing in his sleep. We were also awoken one morning to our other neighbor in his bathroom. It sounded like there was just a curtain between us. I won't get into details, but it was a really awful. Again, if you stayed here normally maybe you wouldn't have neighbors and would just have to deal with the inside noises and housekeeping. The housekeeping folks come down the hall talking as loud as they can around 8am. They do this for about 15 minutes before they start cleaning the rooms. They will also ignore your do not disturb sign and knock on the door around 8:30-8:45 and if you don't answer, try to come in. We heard many other people yelling at them to get out. In the end, you start to look forward to the refrigerator and heating noise to drown out all of the other stuff. The problem is they go off so then you hear it all again, as well as the loud noises when they start up. Oh, and we also ran out of hot water on Sunday so there were no showers. Again, it was sold out so some of this might not apply on normal days, but why take the chance. We travel a lot and stay in everything from motels in the sticks to 5-star places. I like to think we are pretty open minded and appreciate the context we are in, but with all of the choices for hotels in this area I can't think of a single reason you would want to take the chance on staying here. There has to be a dozen better choices you could pick. This hotel needs a major upgrade to fix the dirty and noise issues. It doesn't seem like they have put any real money into this hotel for a decade.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "dougers79", "ReviewID": "UR121890086", "Content": "Found this on hotwire and got a good deal.

This hotel had a rude lady working the front desk. When we arrived at 3:30pm we were told by her well let me see if we have a room ready. I said I hope so it is after 3:00 which is check in time. She said well listen we were busy today and I will see if I can give you a room. I said we have reservations. She said that does not mean we have a room ready for you so just hush and wait. Unreal! Tell me to hush. After a few minutes she said well you are in luck I have one ready. We got to the room and the room was very dirty. 2 towels and no washcloth or soap. We went to the desk to get them. Then the TV did not work right. It was fussy and could not watch it. I called the desk and the same lady said why don't you check the cable connections on it we are too busy. I said I am not a TV tech and please give us another room with a working TV. She said you are lucky you got a room. I said I will check out then. She said wait a guy will check it. About a hour later a man came and he fixed it. We then left to dinner. When returning the hotel there was about 20 motorcycles parked in the underneath of the front enterance. There were about 10 bikers standing outside the door smoking and drinking beer. I was afraid to get out of the car. My husband said lets stick together and go in. Inside the front lobby was a big party of bikers drinking and yelling and talking loud and blocking the way into the lobby area. It was very frightful. We made it to our room and I called to complain at the front desk and was told so what they are guest too and your in your room now so don't worry. We tried sleeping but could not straight through because of all the noise in the hall from the people screaming and yelling like it was a big party out there. I am so upset and talked to the lady in the morning when checking out and was told nothing she could do about it. So this is why I am writing to be compensated for the nightmare at the hotel. Please call my husband or write me back and hope to get this settled.

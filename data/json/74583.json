The room was on the first floor and was very quiet. The hotel has a guest laundry room. We had a bunch of dirty clothes so I ran a load. The machines were coin operated, but the price was reasonable and the hotel provided the laundry soap and dryer sheets. The laundry room was clean too. I stopped by the front desk several times for little things like a stapler, change for the laundry, some tape, drop off some letters for mailing, ask about location of a drug store, ask for an envelope to put all of my receipts in. I always received a smile and a helpful response. We stopped by the front desk and inquired about dining options. The desk clerk gave us a list of recommended restaurants and let us know that the shuttle driver could drop us off on Mill Street in Tempe so we could eat at one of the restaurants in that area. We took her advice and had a great dinner at a Greek restaurant. We called the driver when we finished dinner and she arrived in five minutes at a prearranged pickup area. We asked for a wake up call and received it. We were up too early to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast so we do not know what we missed. We rode the shuttle to the airport for our early flight. Everything was smooth and everyone was great. All in all this was a good experience. We would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to everyone. Oh, yeah - cookies. They make cookies every evening. Mmmm. They were good too. My husband says that this place is first class.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cJust what we were looking for\u201d", "Author": "CaptainPlanIt", "ReviewID": "UR22387208", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Phoenix airport Fairfield the first night of a week long vacation. We worked a half day, drove to our east coast airport and flew across country, arriving at 9 pm local time and 11 pm to our bodies. We were tired and all we wanted to do was sleep. We called the hotel from the courtesy phone in baggage claim and although we had some trouble getting someone to answer, when they did they told us the courtesy shuttle was right outside the door - and it was. How great is that? The driver offered us \"free bottled water\" from a cooler in the front seat, also very nice. The ride to the hotel was short and painless, as was check in, and in mere minutes we were sound asleep in the comfortable bed. If I was a really light sleeper I might be bothered by planes taking off and landing at this hotel, as we would occassionally hear the dull roar of a plane passing by overhead. But we did not need to turn the heat or air on, and I imagine if we had, any sound from the unit would have been greater than that of the planes. If I was a really light sleeper this hotel might not have been the best choice. We woke up early, our bodies still being on east coast time, and enjoyed getting in the outside hot tub. Unlike a lot of other hotels, the pool and hot tub here are open 24 hours. We had a cup of coffee while soaking, watching the sky brighten. It was a good way to start the day. Breakfast was the standard Fairfield fare, with Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast sandwiches to microwave, cereals, muffins and some fruit. The girls restocking the selections were friendly and efficient. We took the hotel shuttle back to the airport to go get a rental car, and the driver took us directly to a line of rental car shuttle busses, we hopped out of the one we were in, onto another and away we went. Painless. My only complaint with Fairfields is the lack of counter space by the sink in the bath. We had about seven square inches, hardly enough room to even set down one toiletry kit let alone two, and not near enough room to unpack. This is an issue I've seen at several Fairfield's, not just at the Phoenix airport, so it is system wide and not this property. All in all we had an entirely satisfactory experience at the Phoenix airport Fairfield, and I would gladly stay here again should our travel plans cause us to stay overnight near the airport.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cMANAGEMENT NIGHTMARE\u201d", "Author": "photoguyLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR21347682", "Content": "My friend reserved two rooms for our overnight before flying out of Phoenix.

I had to call the hotel four times in one day since the voice mail I was given was for someone not at work that day to fix the billing. 3. A security guard knocked on our door at 2:30 am the day of our departure asking for a receipt he was told to collect as the wrong receipt for identical price rooms was switched by them at the desk. 4. Their website states that they have shuttle service to the airport. The problem is that it starts at 6:00 am so forget about making a morning flight and using their shuttle. Answer from the manager was \" Well, we didn't say 24 Hr. shuttle service\". I guess this is another thing the savvy traveler will have to ask about....live and learn. 5. My friend was billed for her room and a more expensive room for the same day. Another double charge problem....with the added insult of a higher price. 6. The hotel alleges that they didn't have my friend's credit card numbers but how I asked could the erroneous billing show up on her credit card statement? 7. The room was neat and clean but this was the most mismanaged hotel I have ever been in.

The only downside for a longer stay might be the distance from any decent eating places. We just wanted to grab a quick bite before going to bed(as it was about 3am according to our body clocks by the time we checked in) so drove a couple of miles down the road to a Burger King. There certainly didn't seem to be anything you could easily walk to. It was not a boutique hotel or friendly B&B and didn't have much character, plus the setting wasn't particularly interesting or pretty - but that wasn't what we needed nor wanted to pay for. I think it was excellent value for money as the quality of the accomodation was better than I thought we'd get for the price - which is why I'm giving it a rating of four and not a three (i.e. in my view it was above average for this price range).

The bed linen looked new. The beds were very comfy, and helped up get a much needed good night's sleep. My teenaged son loved the free in-room wi-fi. We needed more towels and bathrags, so I went to the lobby to ask for them. The clerk handed them to me on the spot so we didn't have to wait for them to be delivered. I could go on and on about the breakfast. 3 or 4 juices, water, coffee, hot and cold cereal, donuts (not a great selection), boiled eggs, yogurt, bagels and cream cheese, but the BEST was waffles. They already have the batter mixed up and in cups. You just pour it in the waffle maker, read the directions, and 2 minutes later you have delicious waffles. YUMMY!!!

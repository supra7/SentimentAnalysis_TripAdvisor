The room we had was on the second floor, which was a little further from the street. This was good because we could hear the sirens very often, though not loudly. If it were a room near the street, I could imagine it could get quite noisy. We especially want to thank Jasmine and Nazneen who were extremely helpful with tips and directions to various sights and attractions in LA. Bravo! Jasmine and Nazneen! However, the same thing cannot be said about Samantha, who said she was not from LA and was new on the job. Whenever we approached her for help, she never made an effort to help us, not even by searching the Internet or asking somebody else who might have the information. To be fair we didn't expect her to know everything, neither did Jasmine nor Nazneen, but Samantha just wasn't helpful at all. It was very frustrating for us because we were very new to LA, having flown almost 19 hours from Singapore. Anyway, our experience and impression were not marred by her.

I felt assured to get that information. When I was assisted to place a call to arrange the shuttle bus one day upon my checkout, I was quoted with a fee of US18 + tips (about 2.00), so I asked the clerk on duty that day (Nazneen) for clarification. The 18+2 price was new to Nazneen too, so she took over and talk to the bus call center. I was very imprssed that Nazneen negotiated for my interest (or of all residents at vagabondinn) with very solid and presuasive reasons, although my original intention was to clarify rather than negotiate. As a non-native travellers in USA, I really appreciate that vagabondinn has clerks who are willing to volunteer important information and negotiate for their cumstomers' interest and can handle things nicely. The only thing I'm not used to is this: to get your breakfast you need to travel from your room to another building where the front desk is located.

We booked the Vagabond in September. The price and location cannot be beat. It is HANDS DOWN superior to the nasty Radisson down the street. It is literally a block off the northern most part of campus. You can park for free and walk to the game. We stayed here last year. The place looked cleaner this year. The rooms are just basic with reasonable furniture and a fairly comfortable bed. NO BUGS. NO SMELLS. The bathroom is also quite basic but there was plenty of hot water. No exhaust vent in the shower area so things get a little steamy. Keep the window open. AC works well. The folks at the front desk were very nice to us. We used the printer to get boarding passes. Coffee in the am was decent. There was some major rave party going on about a block away one evening that literally shook the floors and the walls. This is beyond their control and had nothing to do with the hotel. It was hard to believe that LA allows permits for 40,000 random partiers. But hey, it's LA. Tip: bring ear plugs, then you won't care about any noise. Overall, you should use common sense when running around at night in the area. The hotel does have security (who were quite visible) and security cameras. Tip: Ask for extra towels when you get there because they are a tad small. And with all that steam, you need more drying power. We will be staying here again for sure. The great change over the last year is that the University Gateway apartment complex is now complete and features many decent fast food restaurants and a CVS within a minute walk from the hotel. Things are definitely improving around the whole area. You cannot beat this hotel for a game weekend or any other USC event. It is not posh but it's so worth it not to waste time in the car trying to get to campus from downtown LA (not to mention waiting to get your car out of valet at say, the Biltmore), And you don't have to pay to park on campus which saves time and lots of money on game days.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cNot a rave review\u201d", "Author": "daisygirl59", "ReviewID": "UR120398665", "Content": "This Vagabond Inn has one overwhelming asset--it is next to USC and one of only two hotels in the area.

It is close to USC and downtown. All for about 1/2 the price as hotels within a half mile. You are walking distance to USC and a 25 cent Dash Bush ride to downtown, about 5 minutes away. For business travelers, there are nearby copy services, several banks, UPS, and computer stores all within a short walk.

If you are into dive bars, the 901 bar is across the street, which is a fun time. Dry cleaners are a short walk, A laundromat is about a half mile away on Jefferson. The motel does not have a breakfast restaurant within the compound, but you are an easy walk to 5-10 inexpensive restaurants on Figureroa. Most rooms in this area will run you $225-300. Rooms at the Vagabond will run you about $100 with typical discount cards. Perfect if you can forgo hand-holding, free breakfasts, and chocolate mints on your pillow. If you need that extra special service and hand-holding, then hit the JW Marriot at $299 a night for the cheap rooms. It's about a mile up the road near LA Live.

There were ants in the \"kitchen area\" - where the sink, fridge, and microwave were, but the management is taking care of it--the fumigator was there during our stay. At night, the neighbourhood is generally quiet. The continental breakfast begins at 6:30 a.m., which is great for those of us who are early birds. We were able to get to the Convention Centre by bus - the Dash for only 25 cents per person. The Dash and other bus services are available within a block from the Inn. There are lots of eating places in the vicinity - McDonalds, Subway, Mexican food, etc. If we visited LA again and needed to be close to Downtown, I would definitely stay at this Inn.

Our room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything was in working order. It was nice to have a refrigerator and microwave in the room and to park (for free) just outside our room. Only negatives - we did request an extra pillow but was told none were available (which is plausible considering what appeared to be high occupancy). Also, don't let the \"free continental breakfast\" be a selling factor. It's less than basic; one or two types of pastries, some coffee and that's it. The surrounding area is a mix of college-oriented businesses, some commercial ventures and several fast food restaurants. We walked the two blocks from the Vagabond to USC several times at night and never felt threatened although caution and common sense should always be exercised.

If you have a lot of bags, try to get a ground floor room because there is no elevator and you have to lug everything upstairs. The first night we were here the hotel was full of kids going to a ball game so it was kinda noisy, but that was okay with us. There was a homeless man with a bicycle next to our room and the manager/security persons told him to leave. The diner on premises gave bad service, but perhaps it was a bad day for the girl. LAPD (Police) eat there every morning & we found that to be reassuring. The grounds have pretty flowers with a pool next to the parking lot.

The rooms were larger, the parking was free, the kids loved the pool (warm and no one else used it much, but not the cleanest), and the breakfast was quite good--decent bagels, and a variety of other options, including excellent croissants, donuts, and sticky buns (not all available every day). Also juices, coffee, hot cocoa mix, etc. At the desk, a sign advertised free wireless in some rooms, and the person at the desk said that it was available in every room, but we couldn't get it to work in our room. Then they said it wasn't available in every room. My techie husband got a cord to connect to a land line in the room, but this probably wouldn't work for everyone. My mom and sister's room had an ant invasion and an odd smell -- the management responded quickly to the ants. In our room, we could hear our neighbor's TV through the connecting door, and they could probably hear our kids. We had requested that our two rooms have a connecting door, but they weren't able to put us in adjacent rooms.

When we refused to pay the large amount of money they claimed was the cost of the items, the manager became violent, threatened to call the police and charged our credit card anyway.

The hotel is located in a very nice area, right off 465 on the north side of the city and is convenient to restaurants. The parking lot feels extremely safe and there is a pretty little lake right in front with a gazebo. The lobby is nice, however, on the second floor, the hallways were musty and the air conditioning blew all night. The hall was very quiet, the only sound I heard was the refrigerator trickling. Other than that, we were very pleased with the hotel. The breakfast buffet was adequate, but nothing to write home about. My only complaint would be that the hotel needs to hire a separate person to work the buffet in the morning, because the poor woman in charge of refilling everything was running back and forth trying to answer the phone at the front desk between buffet refills! Also, a little more fresh fruit, like bananas and apples, would be nice -- all that was available the morning we left were oranges.

I can't imagine how it can operate with the total lack of management we observed: We arrived at 10 p.m. with a paid reservation and were given a room key -- to a room where an employee had locked himself inside! -- and peeked out thru the security lock.... He claimed to be working on the door lock -- isn't that on the outside of the door??? Said he wasn't finished, it'd be a half hour.... So we asked for another room. The manager gave us a key to a room with a king bed -- for the 3 of us. So, we headed downstairs yet again for a different room key. (There were only about a dozen cars in the lot, they were FAR from booked...) No appologies, no concern for my exhausted 79 yo mother standing in the hall... This room had 2 queen beds, a ceiling lined with mold, distinct mold smell, hot, humid, stuffy, a bathroom door that was literally falling apart and wouldn't close, and a towel rack that was sitting on top of the toilet below holes in the wall. There wasn't even an exhaust fan in the bathroom -- who in their right mind builds a bath without an exhaust fan??? We were too exhausted to see what a 4th room would offer. We turned the ac on high and went to sleep despite the extremely noisy arctic blast which was finally defusing the mildew smells. Then @ 4 a.m. the alarm went off. 10 min. later the radio came on... Then there was the \"breakfast\" -- rotten apples, a good orange, the only non-white bread or solid starch offering was raisin bran. While a woman was \"stocking\" the \"breakfast bar\" very slowly (tho it was high breakfast time) many things were empty (raisin bran and milk...). At least they had tea. We usually stay at the Jameson on Kelly St., which is fine, but I simply got the wrong one when booking on Expedia because they are so close. Kelly St. isn't a glamourous address, while this is, but managment here must be totally absent.

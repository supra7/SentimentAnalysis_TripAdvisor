This property is part of the Hyatt chain, and we purchased our travel packages through Golfpac, who took care of all the details as an experienced tour company should. The Nicklaus-designed golf courses were immaculately manicured and challenging, but not impossible for high handicappers (I'd probably be a 30 if I had a home course, and the best player in our group is about a 10). Service is SUPERIOR -- at the course, the pro shop, the grill, and the room staff. Everyone goes out of their way to be friendly and make sure you're taken care-of... I thought this was a lost art, but The Villas of Grand Cypress have it down. If you're going for golf, you must must must play the \"New Course,\" a links-style course with symbolic touches to resemble, ironically, the Old Course at St Andrews. Yes, there are pot bunkers, and yes, you will hit into them. I've rarely had more fun on a golf course, though. It's about time for the five of us to start begging our wives for a repeat visit.

From the start, upon booking our rooms through our visit and up to our departure, the staff was extremely helpful. We had special needs due to medical issues and the reservations department went beyond the scope of their property to find us the things we needed to help us get the additional items required. Upon arrival - from the gate to the desk - everyone was very friendly. We pulled into the property after a 20 hour car ride and the bell staff encouraged us all to get out of our cars and enter the lobby for a complimentary beverage and snack of our choice. The bellman - John - assisted us with an escorted ride to our Villas and gave us the grand tour of our accommodations and the available amenities on property - Very nice! We also had 10 boxes delivered prior to our arrival and all were found and delivered to the room without any problems. Pre-ordered a crib and is was in the room upon arrival as requested. We rented (2) Villas - that had 4 bedrooms each with two double beds - (2) rooms a bit smaller but ample room for 4 people and (2) a bit larger with an additional seating area - great for families. One larger and one smaller located upstairs and one larger and one smaller located downstairs. Each family had their own room with their own bathroom and an exit to an outdoor balcony or patio area that overlooked the various ponds on property. Bathrooms were large and spacious with separate shower and separate bath. Only 1 of the 4 bedrooms (upstairs) did not have an additional outdoor access which was great for the family with small children so they did not have to worry about the additional door. We had a kitchen complete with china, glass, silver - full size refrigerator, dishwasher and washer and dryer in each Villa - great when you have a large group and want to pack light. Living room was sunken with working wood fireplace - long dining room table that would seat 8 to 10. We did build a fire on two nights. Patio area had table, chairs and chaise lounges for everyone to enjoy as well. Kids and adults did take advantage of the free bike rentals (full range of sizes for adults or little kids), the fantastic pool with spa pool and great Fruit Colada drinks. Several did get fishing poles from the front desk and tried their luck at fishing in the ponds outside our Villas. Great bike trails and running trails all around the property. The night guard at the entrance was a god send - giving us special directions to and from the airport that got us there and back several times in 30 minutes or less - avoiding I-4 - and the heavy, heavy holiday traffic that would have created and hour or more drive - thank you very much for that. Did not golf but the courses looked amazing - Did eat breakfast in the Grill at the club house - very nice setting. Comfortable with good food and great service. A quick call to the bell staff provide transportation for the elderly members of the family over to the club house for their meal. Needed assistance with boarding passes from the concierge and they had them all printed and bound in nice package for easy access. Thank you concierge. The night front desk clerk on New Year's eve, and on New Year's day was very nice and helped us several times with additional keys for the various rooms and she always had a smile. Housekeeping staff friendly and efficient. Helped us with a few requests again due to medical needs with no hesitation. Needed to rent a DVD player and the bell staff was at our door with the machine within minutes of the call. Great and quick service - as Villa's were fully booked for the holiday. We hit the all 4 parks at Disney and Universal and found easy access to and from the parks via car however there is a shuttle service from the Grand Cypress Hyatt - so you could take a shuttle from the Villas to the Hyatt just across the street and to the parks from there if you did not have your own transportation. Parking for all our cars was directly outside our Villa. We did have access to all the services at the Hyatt as well that included the tennis courts and the basketball courts which the teenage boys used during our visit. We really enjoyed Disney but found the Villas great because it gave us the opportunity to get out of the craziness of Disney and relax in the great surroundings of the Villas. The property exceeded all our expectations and was a great place for a family with diverse needs from 1 year old to 84.

The property is gorgeous and a golfers heaven but the villas need serious updating. The kitchen area looks like a kitchen in a 2 star hotel. The carpet was dirty and stained and we did not feel comfortable walking around without our shoes on and the large roach climbing up the wall upstairs did not make us feel good either. The downstairs bathroom was leaking water onto the tile. The brass accents suggest a mid 80's build. It just felt old. We thought that it would be a great place to stay because it is part of fine hotels but we were extremely disappointed to say the least. If this had been our first time booking through fine hotels we probably would not book again as it was under par. The service at the restaurant was horrible, as the servers would stand around watching television while our glasses were empty on 2 different days. We had two strollers and there were steps in two sections of the restaurant and no one ever offered to help us get the strollers up and down the steps in our 3 days dining there. When we arrived back at the villa from Magic Kingdom at 12:30 am after Mickey's Christmas Party there were no parking spaces available at our villa. So we had 2 babies and everything goes with them to unload after being gone all day and no where to park. The front desk responded by saying to park anywhere around the property. Someone from the front desk did come over the parking lot but only to say I'm sorry and instructed us park on the curb. Nice way to get your car hit...now we understand why the parking is free. We told them at check in that we would like the 4:00 checkout (guaranteed to us by our fine hotels booking) but on the day we were checking out, housekeeping showed up at 9:00 to see what time we were leaving.

Cons: Mgmt is prone to bumping your group around, and things do pop up... All things considered, this is a good spot for a big group. The villas are really quite nice. Probably one of the best we have stayed at. Close proximity to the club house is a bonus. However, I will say the resort does a decent job of making good on its promise of delivering a good golf experience. Here's why: We were supposed to play a lot of this facility. The New course, South, East and North over three days and 36 holes a day. However, we got bumped because they had a bigger group. To make up for it, they gave us free golf for that day. OK - that works with me. HOWEVER - when you end up playing the South back to back and the LPGA is coming to town and every pin is illegally put 2 feet from the edge of the green you kinda wish you were paying the money... With regards to big groups - some years they want you and other years they don't. I called last year to book and they turned us away because we didn't want to commit to 20 golfers. This year, they were more than happy to take our group of 16. I can't explain it. With regards to \"other things pop up:\" Our first day we were to play the New course, but they wanted us to start on the back nine. Fine - we can do that. However, when we made the turn (2hrs after we tee'd off) - we were greeted by the starter \"Jeez - you boys play fast\" and a healthy 30 minute wait to tee off on the front. We made it known that we were not happy about the situation as we were supposed to be able to play 36 a day and that wouldn't happen if we had to abandon our first 18 to make our next tee time for the afternoon. Well, they got on the phone with someone and worked it out. A ranger came out on course and kept us in the loop. Again - they made what could have been a bad experience into a good one, and one that we didn't forget. At the end of the day - this is a good spot. You'll be happy you went. Don't forget to grab a complimentary drink when you check in! Oh - the villas - very spacious. Plenty of room for your buds. We asked for a grill and they brought one down. Very nice to be able to cook in for this group. They also have room service (its pretty quick too). The villas could use a better equipped kitchen, but it was serviceable.

It wasn't - it was better. We decided this time to just spend 2 weeks in Orlando rather than our last trip of 8/9 days in Orlando followed by a week relaxing by the coast. This proved to be a great choice as the Villas/the hotel have a lot to offer for adults and kids. We booked a 2 bed villa, specifying the same one as we had last time if possible. We were given a different one which proved to be much better as it was all on the ground floor with no-one above so nice and quiet. The villa was very clean and I was a little worried beforehand that the Villas may look tired but they weren't and the gardens and golf course remained perfectly manicured. Decor is american in style but generally light and airy and has plenty of space for clothes (and all the purchases). The kitchens are well stocked with utensils so cooking (we tended to have breakfast and some evening meals there) was fairly easy. The cleaning staff were excellent. The villas have their own pool with jacuzzi, bikes and a bar which served food. The pool was never busy but we tended to go to the hotel pool for its facilities (see below). We ate one breakfast at the Golf clubhouse which we really enjoyed but was a bit too big for us so we generally then ate in the villa. We mixed our trip up with parks and down-days where we'd relax and we tended to go to the hotel pool which is large and has a slide. The resort fee includes the use of boats, a climbing wall, a pitch and putt golf course, tennis courts, (not sure about the driving range), table tennis - plenty to do. This kept our boys busy and made for a relaxing time by the pool where the service of food/drinks was great. There is also a games room which the boys enjoyed, plus a gym which we didn't quite get round to using. There is a hotel shuttle bus which can be used to get around but we tended to drive. The hotel pool got very busy at the weekend and it was difficult to secure an umbrella but there is some shade from trees. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants at the hotel or by the Villas as we tended to eat a larger lunch when in the parks and sometimes out for dinner. The location of the Villas are excellent, being just outside Disney and near to the I4 (although it was just as easy to travel parallel to the I4 to get to, e.g. Universal). One of the outlet malls is very close, just the other side of the I4 so we also went there a few times, plus a trip to Florida Mall to get the kids next year Abercrombie and Hollister. There is a good selection of restaurants within a short drive of the Villas (a bit too far to walk).

Not sure it would be my first choice if left to my own devices, but if I was going to Orlando with a golf foursome, I'm sure I could do a lot worse!", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delta,British Columbia, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreen as far as the eye can see...\u201d", "Author": "raingirl4", "ReviewID": "UR113707984", "Content": "The Grand Cypress was a wonderful place to stay.

The carpet was badly stained in several spots and the decor is going to need refreshing soon. However, the french doors which opened to our private balcony where it was green as far as the eye can see was spectacular. It was peaceful and quiet and very relaxing.

Prior to booking I kept on looking for a comparison between the Villas and the Hyatt and never found one on Trip Advisor so here goes. For a couple weeks in May I had bookings at both hotels/villas at a similar rate with breakfast included and had a hard time making up my mind so I'll try to help out anyone in the same situation. Start with breakfast ok? The clubhouse/Villas breakfast is awesome but only one entree included plus beverages can be ordered. However the portions are huge and the service is top notch. But the Hyatt's breakast buffet is legendary. So if you get breakfast thrown in at either place you have to give the Hyatt the edge. So ok, I finally chose the Villas this year and it was a the perfect decision for us as we were looking for serenity at the time. Ok with that out of the way let me compare the two places. As anyone who has stayed at either place knows, if you stay at the Villas, you also have free access to all the Hyatt amenities. The Villas are beautiful, serene, attuned to nature, much more roomy, quaint, needing some updating, but still better than any others in Orlando. The service is impeccable. Wildlife is right outside your door and you are right on one of the most beautiful golfing venues in the world. Tthe food at the clubhouse is above great. The sevice is exceptional. So why consider the Hyatt if you have an equal deal at the Villas? Now remember the carrot for staying at the Villas is that you can use all the Hyatt's amenities and they are far and away the best in Orlando. But why not just stay at the Hyatt all things being equal? Well it all depends on the kind of vacqtion you want. Serene and laid back but elegant as well - at the Villas. Or energetic, electric, and at times frenetic - at the Hyatt. One of the Hyatt advantages is that you are actually right there every single day with the best customer sevice people anywhere. And it feels more like you are on vacation with all the hub bub. The hotel offers a ton of amenities including it's natural and man made beauty. The rooms are second to none but not as roomy as the villas and not as attuned to nature with their serenity. . But remember if you are basing your choice of the Villas on being able to use the Hyatt amenities, you wll be spending a good 2 hours a day going back and forth, packing and unpacking, even with the free shuttle from the Villas. So it all depends on the type of vacation you are looking for. That is the key. Ok some things to consider at both places. A refrigerator in your room in todays day and age is a must. The Hyatt rooms include it free. At the Villas it is not, but you can easily negotiate the 15 dollar charge down to free of charge and also get them to throw in the micro. Also, at weekend time, in order to access the Hyatt pool you have to get down to the pool by 7AM because people get there and put their towels down on teh chairs, and then take off for a big chunk of the day. It doesn't seem fair but it's reality. And remember the pool area is the best in Orlando and is a huge attraction in itself. So if you stay at the Villas you are at a disadvantage for accessing the pool at weekend time. Also, the fitness center which is fantastic is right at the Hyatt's three lagoon pool. No fitness center at the Villas. The Villas have a very nice pool, but the water is very warm and no comparison to the Hyatt. They also have a snack and drink bar at the pool. Remember although I chose the Villas this time around my mind is not made up for next year. And also remember, every resevation rate is negotiable. You can make a reasonable offer and ask the resevation taker to take the offer to the manager. My wife and I look forward to once again being at the Villas-or the Hyatt next year at this time although right now we may choose once again to go with the Villas if the price is right. We absolutely loved everything at the Villas except for having to travel back and forth to the Hyatt.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Worth", "Title": "\u201cLoved staying here!\u201d", "Author": "juanp2", "ReviewID": "UR110038858", "Content": "Great place to stay, very quiet, has a gated entrance.

The pool didn't open until 8 and it was very annoying and I felt like it was the amazing race to get a chair. Anyway, the towels at the villa pool were like oversized dish towels. They used to be the same towels as the hyatt and now they were changed. This made it somewhat uncomfortable and they were very rough and too small. They need to have the same towels as the Hyatt pool towels so that they are more comfortable. That being said, everything else was perfect.

I've been an active traveler since I was a child, and I've stayed in many places, and I'm typically not one to complain about a stay. Generally, I know what to expect ahead of time based on price, brand, past experiences, etc. I'll break down the stay in three categories; the good, the average, and the bad. THE GOOD: -The location is ideal as it's super close to Disney, and easy to get anywhere you want in Orlando. -The grounds themselves are quiet, and beautiful as the villas are situation in the golfcourse. -The pool is huge and \"resort style\", and one of the hot tubs even has a waterfall flow into it. It's also open until 11, which is great after a long, hot day at the parks. -The price, we ended up getting our Villa for 97$/night off of hotwire. It was my first time using that site and I was hesitant, but I couldn't beat the price for the location. THE AVERAGE: -The room itself. While the pictures on the website seem to make the rooms like nicer than they really are, I can say that it's mostly on the average end. I say this only because this is supposed to be a 4 1/2 star property, and so I'd expect a little more from the rooms. They were most likely \"modern\" when the Villas were built, though some updating (esp. in the bathroom) would be good to correspond with the rating. Also, the AC system is dated, and as such, takes a while to kick in. The wood that was at the bottom of the door to access the terrace was rotting, and while the bathroom was huge, the layout was quite weird. Fridges are available, but for 15$ a day. Finally, while the golfcourse setting is picturesque, you can't forget that since you're \"in nature\", you WILL see possums, big spiders, mosquitoes when you exit the pool, etc. THE BAD: -One word, the SERVICE. I do not say this lightly, and I'm aware that things can happen, miscommunications, etc... but this is the service errors that we encountered: -The MOST awkward check-in attendant I've ever had. He was nervous, unsure, and I have honestly never dealt with someone who seemed scared by me. -The website talks about a complimentary courtesy shuttle to all Disney and Orlando parks. What they DON'T mention is that you are shuttled from The Villas to the Hyatt down the street, to then be shuttled to the parks on what I would call a very limited schedule. For Universal, there was only ONE pick up time, so we just decided to drive (good decision). We called the front desk to ask to be shuttled to the Hyatt, they said that they may not be able to make it in time, so they would call back to find a solution. The desk clerk calls back and says we can't make it in time for the shuttle, but that the hotel would pay for a taxi to bring us there, which I accepted. A few minutes later we have another call saying that the manager said that they couldn't pay for a cab for us and that it was our own problem, to then have a ring at our door, it was a shuttle driver. Talk about not knowing what's happening! - I called room service shortly after 10:30 to order a pizza, only to be told that there was no chef on duty. If there are room service hours, someone should be around to be working. -When returning from the shuttle to the Hyatt, we had to get them to call the Villas who said that there was just 1 bell hop working right now, and that he would come get us when he had time. Eventually, it was a shuttle and not a bell boy that arrived (again, get your act together) -Since there was no chef, we ended up ordering our own pizza. We got a call later saying that the delivery guy was at the gate, and he wasn't being allowed in. So I had to drive to the gate to pick up my own \"delivery\". While I was gone, security had actually called the room and demanded to know why we didn't \"clear\" this delivery with them. (One BIG exception to the service was our valet Bernie. He was completely friendly, helpful, and dealt with two requests that we had promptly!)

The clubhouse/golf courses were excellent, but there are no gyms or spas onsite (they have in-room services or you can go to the Hyatt) and the pool isn't great (much better at the hyatt but again, you need to take the shuttle). In my view, this resort is NOT up to the standards of most Amex Platinum hotels and service was a bit inconsistent. The good: 1. Location: A calm, quiet resort away from the hustle and bustle of Disney but very close to parks (10-15 min drive). 2. Spacious villas: Our 3 BR villa had a large living room with wet bar area, working brick fireplace, patio/\"backyard\" overlooking the lake, full size dining room w/8 chairs, 3 nice-sized bedrooms with bath, and a full kitchen w/dishwasher, microwave, range, etc. as well as a washer/dryer. 3. Good value: Compared to comparable hotels on Disney properties, this was a MUCH better value for the space and amenities. A full breakfast was also included in our rate through Amex FH&R. 4. Clubhouse: Breakfast food was pretty good, though service was slow and inconsistent at times. The bad: 1. Upgrade/renovation: The villas need it. The furniture, carpet, etc were clean and well maintained, but they look like they would have been \"modern\" 10-15 years ago. We were definitely not impressed by the brown tile bathrooms with brown tubs and gold hardware (again, clean), bad lighting in the bathrooms (florescent bulbs), decent but not great linens, etc. 2. Saw a cockroach scurry by in the kitchen. We were on the ground floor, but still ... 3. Our key cards kept getting scrambled/de-magnetized so we were left standing in front of our villa late in the evening while one of us drove to the registration building to get new keys. And yes, we kept them away from cell phones and credit cards. 4. The shuttles to Disney run pretty infrequently and on a schedule -- we ended up driving rental cars there. 5. The $18/day/room resort charge is annoying. I'm happy paying it for the services, but it should just be bundled into the room rate!!! The ok: 1. Generally, customer service was good (esp. the concierge and bellmen, front desk was ok and restaurant was inconsistent). 2.

I did get the upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite but had repeated issues with cleanliness of the bathroom and also the place had a bad odor. Since it was just me and the wife not sure we needed the space but could see benefit on booking if you had a family as it was roomy assuming you don't have same issues that I had. Also, I saw on previous comments a mention of a shuttle; however the shuttle will only take you to the main hotel so if you want to get ride to WDW be prepared to spend $15ish each way for taxi's. We had a car but did not want to drive as we wanted to have a couple of adult drinks at Downtown Disney. Also, my wife had an opportunity to get a massage at main hotel, but the facility was lacking. They have since moved the spa rooms from the work out center to the Hair Salon and the room walls are paper thin and not in a spot that is not very relaxing. There were some positives though and perhaps I just got the wrong room and wrong people addressing my issues. The property is beautiful and if you into golf, the courses appear to be good (I don't play). The pool at the main resort is also great for kids. The location is close to everything Disney but away from the hustle / bustle of the area. Lastly, upon check out the person asked how my stay went and I said I had issues.

The environment is quiet and gets you immediately in touch with nature with its lush golf courses, trees and ponds. The resorts provides transportation within the resort Pros: I cannot praise this hotel enough. The customer service is one of the very best that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced anywhere. The staff were genuinely friendly, caring and very efficient. From the moment we reached the gate of the hotel, we received personalized service. The check in desk made it look like they were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpecting' us. They were very professional. Guests could help themselves to complimentary coffee, tea, liquor and other stuff at the lobby. The porter to take us and our luggage to our room was already waiting for us. This was done as efficiently as he gave us a brief overview of the resort. Our room was a club suite, spacious and beautifully furnished. Our bathroom even had a Jacuzzi with top quality toiletries and other bathroom amenities. Room service was excellent. Tasty and quickly delivered. I strongly recommend the salads and also the salmon with vegetables. There is a shuttle service from the villas to Hyatt and then to all the major theme parks. This is very efficient and saves a lot of money on cabs. We were never stranded or had to wait. Our dear friend Mr Dale (the villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle driver) was always there to transport us from the Hyatt to the Villas. The front desk lady, Rachael, the concierge, Mary and Gareth were very helpful to us during our stay. The resort also has a pool (which we did not use).

My view is that our family came to Disney and wanted a nice condo that will give us some room without expecting a high price (in comparison to what is available) nor a luxury room. Why I write this is because I feel this hotel is trying to a classy fancy hotel and charges for that but it is not truly up there. It may be nicer than many condos in the area with an attempted look of high class but it is missing details: Price: It was higher than other condos to start but we did not mind and wanted to try something differant. What irked us bad is the $18.00 per room room per day fee that did not show up on our reservation with Expedia nor is spelled out on their site until you book direct online or show up and pay for an expedia trip. This adds $36.00 per day for our two room villa which brings it up in comparison and does NOT make it worth while to us. They should be upfront on costs and perhaps learn from Mickey who although is expensive does not hide any costs or surprise you in any way. Rooms: They are nicely decorated but missing amenities if they wish to compare to luxury places. Little details but for example holes in the trim or missing pieces of trim, blinds that do not close, the toilet seat that is missing pieces, the shower head that is removable but does not have an adjustable head, the kitchen which is tiny. Again all small details but when I pay for a luxury place I have differant expectations. I hope this makes sense. Parking: Not enough and you are not gauranteed a spot. We came home to zero parking in our area and got told by the front desk that sorry we are very full so you will need to try the other lots. For this price each villa should be gauranteed at least one spot!! Again details. Service: I will end with saying the service from the staff was great. They smiled, greeted us and followed up wonderfully. They made us feel welcome and by the looks of the reviews make people happy. Alright I hope this helps some people. Again this is a nice hotel and it made us happy but I am writing this review from the standpoint of the price and how it holds itself.

The Villas are about as close as you can get to Disney without being at Disney (10 to 20 minute easy drive, depending on which Disney park, Magic Kingdon the closest!) Still, once you pass through the front gate there is nothing Disney about the Villas--it is a luxurious resort community situated on rolling golf course(s). Although we don't really play golf, the setting was magnificent! We had just returned from a week in a drop-dead gorgeous place in the Bahamas and we were still impressed. We had a two-bedroom villa, which was a one-bedroom villa with full kitchen, living room with wide screen TV, bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower and bedroom with sitting area and wide screen TV, and then another one-bedroom villa attached with same bathroon and bedroom. All rooms were huge and had french doors/windows with fairway/greens views. The Villas' pool was a short walk away and was very nice with a nice bar/snack stand. We ate dinner at the clubhouse sports bar one night and it was great! There is a great Winn-Dixie very close to stock up on groceries--it was nice to have breakfast in the rooms. Also, every, and I do mean EVERY, chain restaurant you have ever heard of can be found in Lake Buena Vista within a mile or two of the Villas. As a guest of the Villas, you can charge things at the nearby Hyatt, which is a huge complex. We went to their pool one afternoon; it has a rope bridge, water slide, swim up bar. The kids actually preferred the quieter pool at the Villas. Also, the Hyatt has paddle boats you can take on the lake. You can check out a bike at the Villas (easy to ride cruiser) and ride to the Hyatt or just around the Villas. My older son liked to do this, while rest of us were at Disney. He also liked the putting green, which is complementary. We were going to spend a night in Cocoa Beach when we went to the Kennedy Space Center, but cancelled that once we got to the Villas and saw how great they were (we just drove to Kennedy and back in a day--easy drive).

It was great to come back to a washer and dryer, never had to worry about clothes that needed to be washed, room service was excellent on the nights we came back too late to eat at a restaurant, excellent key lime pie. Our room was on the lake and golf course, beautiful views, we could see the fireworks at closing at Disney World from our patio every night. Housekeeping was excellent. We would not stay anywhere else on a return trip to Orlando. So relaxing after dealing with the theme parks all day. The grounds of the hotel with the golf courses and everything else are gorgeous.

If you are an able-bodied golfer, you'll enjoy yourself (unless you're expecting something in addition to the golf..). I broke my ankle a couple of days before we left (Europe) for 3 weeks in Orlando. I'd considered cancelling the trip, afraid mobility issues would turn me into an albatross around my husband's and daughter's necks. Of course, Orlando is the home of the wheelchair and a week's stay at the Portofino Bay went without a hitch. Then we arrived for an 11 night stay at the Villas. Though I had advised them a week prior to our arrival that I had broken my ankle and would need a disabled-access room and a wheelchair (and called to remind them the day before our arrival, as I'm obsessive), when we arrived - no wheelchair. Finally a Shrek-sized wheelchair was delivered later in the day which weighed more than the rent car. The concierge had ordered a giant sized chair. Finally, a day later a smaller chair was delivered and Shrek's chair picked up. The smaller chair had broken brakes. We asked for that one to be replaced and got the answer \"there were no wheelchairs free in Orlando\" (they should check out the Disney parking lot after hours..). Finally, 3 days later another company delivered a wheelchair which the hotel receptionist noticed was broken (the brakes again) - and still they delivered it to our room! All this took up our first 3 days at the hotel where I was stranded with no means of getting around, waiting around for somebody to either pick up or deliver a wheelchair. And of course, the 3 days were punctuated by numerous phone calls to the concierge/front desk/wheelchair company. We finally rented one ourselves at Turner Drug - a 5 minute drive down the road from the Villas. I informed the concierge of where we found a wheelchair and I hope in the future the concierge will know where to find one if a guest so requires. When you have a broken ankle, you are stuck at the Villas. You have to drive everywhere, except for the golf courses and a swimming pool, neither of which I could use, there's nothing to do. The atmosphere is somewhere between comatose and moribond. Being a noble sort of person, I let my husband go off golfing while my daughter and I spent our days quarreling over what to watch on TV. When my husband had an early tee-time, I ordered room service for my daughter and myself for 8:30 so we would have something to do waiting for him to play his round. At 9:45 I called room service to enquire where our breakfast was, they said they had forgotten to pick up the orders the night before and what did I want them to do about it? No apology of course. Otherwise, the room should sleep 4 in 2 queen beds. The beds are comfortable beds, but they aren't double beds, they are so narrow and short (even the passionately amorous - and short - couldn't sleep 2 in one of those beds), I kept expecting Snow White to show up looking for Grumpy (me) and Sneezy (me, too, the air conditioning would kick in at 3 a.m. and you'd wake up to arctic conditions in the room). The hotel did quickly deliver a folding bed so our daughter (good-naturedly) accepted sleeping on that so my husband and I each got a \"double\" bed to ourselves and avoided divorce. My husband loved the golf courses and found them in immaculate condition so at least somebody was happy.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAn unforgettable stay.

I noticed another website that was offering a better rate and when I emailed the Grand Villas to cofirm the other website was genuine I received an almost immediate reply which was also a very polite one. Some staff at expensive hotels when contacted about better prices they give you the feeling they would rather not deal with you. The staff at Grand Villas was very polite and very helpful from the start. They matched the rate and they also advised to make the most of the resort fee by describing what activities the resort fees cover. The lady that took the reservation also asked whether we prefer a lake view or a golf view room which I thought was very thoughtful. One thing that always dissapoints me in 5 star hotels is the room. All 5 star hotels have fairly average rooms unless you pay exorbitant amounts for a penthouse. However the Grand Villas exceeded my expectations. The villa I got which was the cheapest of them all had the following: a large living room with a pullout sofa and additional arm chairs as well as a huge plasma TV and a fire place and mini bar. There was also a completely separate dining room. The bedroom was in a sense a double room. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room had a huge kingsize bed with another huge plasma TV in it. The other room which was in a sense part of the bedroom was actually a split level room located a few steps down from the bedroom and it had another pullout sofa as well as some armchairs. There was also a full separate kitchen which also had a closed which had a washing machine and a dryer. The bathroom had a huge shower and I mean a huge one which had glass doors (not your typical shower with plastic curtains) and there was also a deep jacuzzi bath. And I forgot to mention my favorite: there were bath robes in the closet in the bedroom. All the rooms had doors leading to the outside garden which was surrounding the villas we stayed in. There was also a table with chairs outside living room which had great views of the lake and was undercover under some part of the villa. The car was easy to park, just outside the villa which was only a few steps away from the door. So we arrive at the Grand Villas. There was a security booth at the entry and after giving our name the guard was raised and we drove to the check in villa which is a separate building. On the way there were these great views of this magnificent golf course which impressed even a non golfer such as myself. At the check in they asked me if I want a complementary drink and that is when I noticed a bar full of ice with various alcoholic drinks in it. I don't drink and was early in the morning anyway. They advised the room wasn't yet ready (we were there early in the morning) but they would take our bags and take them to our room and upon our return all we would have to do is pick up the key and go to the room. Anyway, to save time I decided to leave the bags in the car and hit another amusement park. When I returned to pick up the key they sent two porters in a golf cart to show us the way to our villa. We followed them and as I described above the villa was stunning. Anyway, these were the best porters I have ever seen. I just got the sleeping kid out of the car after opening the boot and by the time I took him inside I noticed all the bags were already inside the room along with some separate items. These porters/bell boys or whathever you call them were amazingly fast. Even now I can't believe how efficient they were. So we established the vilas had great rooms. In the evening we went to check out the pool. What was great about the pool was that it seemed heated and even at 11pm it was not cold at all for a swim. I think the pool was heated though I am not fully sure. What I liked about the pool was the fact it was only a few steps away from the villas. Some other hotels you have to walk a lot before you reach the pool. The pool itself was not something special and yet the fact the water seemed heated and it also had two separate jacuzzis made it all seem great. One of the jacuzzi had a waterfall falling straight into the jacuzzi which was spectacular. There was also a nice garden close to the waterfall so it looked good in the photos. There were plenty of fresh plushy towels near the pool and there was also a ping pong table under a pergola near the pool. There was only one casual restaurant on the premises at the club house which was serving decent food. Another nice touch was the free internet access from the computer located near the concierge desk at the clubhouse. Of all the luxury hotels I stayed, I must say this is the one that impressed me the most. To be fair the kitchen was a little average and perhaps not so modern looking and the bathroom has some signs of getting a little old but these are extremely small defects especially when comparing with the overall great experience. Please note there are no shuttles from this hotel to the parks. It didn't bother us because we had a rented car (a must whenever you're staying in Orlando). The only shuttle is from the next door Hyatt and you do have to be there at a certain time. We were going to stay at the Grand Hyatt and we went to see it because they allow you to use the pools at the Grand Hyatt but we were much, much happier to stay at the villas. The rooms were cleaned daily and the nightly turndown service was also a pleasant touch. There was also a free inroom safe. If you can stay at this place do it.

Golf Course - My husband was amazed at the quality of the courses and was especially happy with the New Course which is a copy of St Andrews. The buggys being part of the price as well gave you that extra little touch. Location - The hotel is a ten minute drive to disney and minutes away from a great selection of restaurants.

General facilities - the pool at the villas is large and was not very busy during our stay. Sometimes we had it all to ourselves.

Our primary reason for booking our vacation here, in addition to the excellent tripadvisor reviews, was so that my son and husband could play golf and yet as a family we would have plenty of options for other things to do. This property was perfect for that. As mentioned in other reviews, the Villas has a quiet, more residential feel. There are 5 buildings located directly on the golf courses and with a central pool area. We booked a clubhouse suite on the second floor. This is basically a large room (bigger than the typical hotel room) with a large bathroom and balcony. I requested a minifridge which they provided for no extra charge. Throughout our stay, the service was excellent - very friendly and accomodating in every way. On our second day, as my daughter and I were biking, the bellman who had met us on check in greeted us by name. Our housekeeper was friendly and chatted with us as well as asking for our preferences about the room setup. On our last day, we also requested a slightly later checkout time, which they granted. On the premises of the Villas they have bikes (and helmets for kids). The on site pool was quiet with a bar on site. Most of our family afternoons, though, were spent at the affiliated Hyatt which is a minute drive away (or the shuttle will come and bring you there any time, on request). We parked in the self parking lot which leads right to the pool area - the Hyatt pool area is much larger with 2 pools, one more heated than the other, waterslides, rock climbing wall which is open from noon-3pm, more bicycles, and a sandy \"beach\" and lake with paddleboats, kayaks, canoes, and one person Sunfish sailboats. There is also a 9 hole pitch and putt course right there (clubs available at the poolhouse). There is no additional charge for any of these activities (I was told that there is a daily $60 resort fee, but this fee was included in our package, so it is worth double checking with whomever you book with about it) . It was great to have such a range of things to choose from. Golf- the North course is currently being renovated, so my husband and son played many days on the New Course and South/East course. (they told me that the greens were challenging, the New Course is like Scotland links courses, but I'm not experienced enough to give more accurate golf details!) The week we were there, it seemed very quiet and there was no trouble with tweaking tee times, and they got to go out as a twosome the whole week. Though the courses are clearly professional level, the overall feeling was relaxed and welcoming, even to our kids. What we most enjoyed was their 3 exhibition holes (no charge) which my daughter and I could play - it was quiet at the end of the day and we had a great family golf experience on several afternoons without the pressure of having to play 18 holes. Overall, though, there were no other children, perhaps a handful of teens, so serious golfers don't need to worry! Equestrian Center - down the street from the Villas - my daughter took 2 private riding lessons there which were very good - not just a pony ride, but she learned real skills even though she was a beginner. Dining - at the Villas itself, just the clubhouse for breakfast/lunch, and the toney Nine18 restaurant which had great food (no kids menu, but they made whatever our kids wanted - then again, no other kids were there the night we ate!). Salon - we also had pedicures at the Hyatt Salon (not sure I would call this a full blown \"spa\" though) which were great and the people were very friendly. I loved the Lake Buena Vista location of this property - it was very convenient with lots of restaurants nearby, and close to International Drive. We did not go to Disney at all, but the entrance to the Disney area was basically down the street from the Grand Cypress Resort. I felt that all of the previous reviews of this property on tripadvisor are accurate - this property has a very quiet and secluded (anti- Disney madness) feeling. If you were not interested in golf at all, however, the primary reason to stay here would be to have a 1 or 2 bedroom villa. With younger children or the need for more amenities right on site, you might consider the Hyatt itself (I didn't see the rooms, but the grounds are really beautiful and the whole pool and recreation area was great) since that is where kids will have the most fun. In response to one review about the rooms being dark - our 2nd floor suite was a little on the dark side but we had a lot of natural light in the bathroom where there were skylights. Perhaps a first floor unit might feel darker. The room decor is a teeny tiny bit dated - not at a Four Seasons/granite counters/lush bedding level, but extremely clean and comfortable nonetheless (and I'm pretty picky). We never heard (or really even saw) many other people there, even on days where we were told the property was full. There was some ongoing noise which was most apparent in the bathroom; I think this was the air conditioning units outside. Didn't bother us at all, but could be annoying to someone sensitive to sound.

A call to maintenance promised a fix the next day, but no one came. Hyatt credited us one nights room for our trouble. At a very reasonable $179 rate this was OK.

How I wish I hadn't! We arrived at about 1pm and were taken straight to our villa, which was very near the pool. The room was large, but the facilities (with the exception of the TV) were rather dated. The keys we were issued didn't work, so had to go back to reception to be re-issued. By the time they were sorted it was about 2ish so we decided to head over to the clubhouse for some lunch. Unfortunately it was full of children, running all over the place and shouting - not condusive to a nice lunch - so we took the free transport over to the Hyatt. By the time we got there it was nearer to 3pm and there was nothing open except the sushi bar (not an option when your husband is allergic to all fish) the pool bar (pre-packed salads only) and the little shop, so we got some chips and crackers and took the transport back to the villa. We went back to the clubhouse for dinner, choosing to sit at the bar. I ordered the chicken wrap and a salad and F had the kobe burger. I will say, the bartender made me the best marguerita I'd had all week, and I'd sampled a fair few! F's burger looked really tasty, but my chicken wrap was not just cold but chilled almost to the point of being dry - as if it had been pre-made and sat in the fridge all afternoon. That night, at 2am, I was woken by F trying to swot an annoying insect - I put the light on to see a HUGE cockroach crawling out from under his pillow. It was so large they could have charged us for triple occupancy! We had planned on ordering room service breakfast the next morning, but before 9am some men began doing work on a neighbouring patio and it made so much noise we decided to venture back to the clubhouse - once again full of the loudest children I've ever come across. After a morning in Orlando we arrived back at the villa to find that once again our keys were not working - again, back to reception to have them re-issued. On our second and final morning we did order room service and were told it would arrive within 30 minutes. Actually it was closer to 60 and then the bill had to be sent back as it had the wrong room number on it. During our wait for breakfast, housekeeping knocked on the door to ask when we would be checking out. We said at about 11.30 - at 11am there came another knock, followed immediately by housekeeping letting themselves in! By now we were feeling rather hurried and not having the leisurely final morning we had planned. All in all, except for the roach, these were only minor issues, but they all added up to a rather annoying stay - not at all what we expected when we booked what (then) was the number one rated hotel in Orlando.

This property is very close to all the Orlando attractions, but once you enter the grounds you do feel like you are a hundred miles away from the bustle of the tourist strip. The fact that it shares many amenities with the Hyatt Grand Cypress across the street is a plus, as it gives you more to do on property.

If quiet pool side time is your goal, stay at the pool at the Villas, otherwise get the free shuttle across to the hotel. The lake and boats, the bikes to travel around the grounds, the pools, the nature trail, the jogging trails, the horse back riding- all make for an excellent unwinding spot within a short drive of the attractions of Orlando.

We still feel this way despite a gliche in our first nights accomodation! Upon arrival we came to find out that our 1 bedroom suite was not available, and needed to spend our first night in a club suite (no kitchen, washer/dryer). We were disappointed at first, but were able to laugh later. Needless to say they (management) went out of their way to rectify the inconveneince and making the remainder of our stay great!!!!! We also love the availability of the Equestrian Center next door and the tremendous facilities down the road at the Hyatt Regency Hotel! We both agree along with many other guests that this resort is a true diamond in Disney's neighborhood!! No need to even consider staying at any of the Disney properties!!!! You are literally next door or 5 - 10 minutes from anywhere in Disney!

The maid service was excellent, with a turn down service at night as well. They provide everything here, dishwasher tablets, washing powder, washing up liquid, tea, coffee,shampoo,soap etc... The grounds are immaculate and kept extremely clean and tidy, the gardeners are out every day tidying up. The pool area is lovely with sunbeds and tables and chairs. There is no childrens's section to the pool but they do have a hot tub, the deepest the pool goes to is 5 feet. They have a snack bar here as well where you can get cocktails, coffee, snacks etc. We visited the Hyatt which is about 3 miles away, you can get the courtesy bus or just take your own car. We were glad we had chosen the villas as it is a lot quieter, certainly the hotel was lovely, the pool area looked great with waterfalls and slides, more to do for older children here. We ate in the Hemmingway's restaurant one night, it was ok, better restaurants outside i felt. All in all a truly wonderful holiday here, if you are thinking of going, DO, I certainly didn't want to leave. Oh forgot to say, the ducks visited us every day for their daily feed of bread from our 3yr son, he loved it. I'm already planning to go back, I did a lot of research for our accommodation in Orlando and I'm so glad we found the Villas of Grand Cypress, we normally stay in 5 star properties, travel 3 times a year so I'm pretty hard to please, I would have no hesitation in recommending this property. The only negative was at the registration desk, the staff didn't seem very welcoming or friendly, shame as this is the first contact with customers.

First, our expectations were: 1) Practical, reasonably priced resort with romantic tones. 2) A place not connected to Disney and/or not greatly effected by Disney crowds, traffic, kids, etc. 3) A place not too far from the International Airport in Orlando (MCO). We got all this and more. Before you read on, keep in mind that we came down in the middle of May, which seemed to be a bit of an off-season for Orlando. Hardly any Disney traffic on any of the major highways and smaller crowds. I hear in July it gets pretty jammed down there. Also, the weather was PERFECT during this time, upper 70's and lower 80's with no humidity. This also changes in July, so again, bear that in mind. And lastly, we stayed from a Monday to a Sunday, so the majority of our experience was during the week during an off-season. Once Friday came around, we saw a slight increase in the amount of people on the resort. Which isn't a big deal of course, but like I said, just keep it in mind. Ok let me get the bad stuff out of the way: 1) The grounds seemed to be under a lot of construction. This was, 99% of the time, around the golf course, so if you're not a golfer, as I and my wife are not, then you won't care much. 2) The rental bikes were pretty banged up so make sure if you rent them you get a good one. 3) There was a $25 a night fee they tacked on to the bill. This fee covers the pool, bike rental, and some other things they have there that are \"free\" to the Villas residents and is reasonable, but I just didn't like that no one said anything about the fee. It just gets added on to the bill. If you look close on some of the paperwork they give you, it mentions something about it. But this is after you've already booked the room. Not a huge deal, I just like to know what I'm expected to pay up front. 4) The pool water was strangely salty. I don't know if there is a new tasteless pool cleaner out there, but when pool water tastes like salt, it kind of gives me the willies. Not that I had a straw and was quenching my thirst with pool water, but if you are a swimmer, either casual or pro, you understand what I mean. 5) We stayed in a Club Suite, which was awesome, but it lacked a real fridge. You can kind of use the little honor bar fridge but there wasn't much room in it and it wasn't too cold. We got a foam cooler and kept ice in there. That's all the bad stuff. As you can see, none of that really should keep you from staying here and it certainly did not stop me from giving this place the highest rating. Ok on to the good stuff... 1) Aside from the construction, grounds overall are fantastic. It is a golf resort, so the majority of the landscaping is either golf course or golf course inspired, but if you've ever seen a golf course, you know that they are typically well groomed and beautiful. This place is no different. The area where the actual Villas lie sports brick roadways, a simple but beautiful pool with two hot tubs, and a pay bar with snacks open during the day. 2) Check in was painless and fast. We walked in, were offered free drinks (beer, even!) and our checkin couldn't have been faster. Then one of the wonderful staff members named Randy lead us to our Villa, a Club Suite. Randy was fantastic and friendly, took our bags, and bid us good day when we were all ready to settle in. 3) Once in our room, in a Club Suite, the only thing missing really was the fridge, as mentioned above. Other than that though, the place was fantastic and perfect for a honeymoon. For the price, you can't beat it. Big LCD TV, roman tub with plenty of room for two, seperate shower, HUGE bathroom, King Bed, patio overlooking a lake, nice closets, etc. The room was perfect for the money spent. Can't beat it. Housekeeping was great as well. Just make sure you leave a nice tip every night, it's a big room to clean. 4) Since the Villas and the Hyatt are together, you can explore the Hyatt grounds as if you are staying there. They have a HUGE pool (more kiddy attractions, so keep that in mind if you go there) and a game room, and their own bar and work-out room. We didn't use these much, but when we return to Grand Cypress (which we will for sure) we plan on using these more. The bikes were better at the Hyatt too so if you want to rent, rent them there. 5) Eat at the Black Swan at least ONCE. Very expensive but the food is outstanding. I recommend the souffle. Here's the summery: This place is VERY practical for the regular, average, everyday working folks like my wife and I. It's affordable, and they make you feel like a king and queen. It's a perfect location, just make sure you rent a car, as the shuttle service they provide is very limited. Fantasic honeymoon, didn't want to come back, reasonably priced, what more could you ask for?

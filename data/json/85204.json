Food in the restaurant was wonderful and the breakfust buffet is quite good. The only two issues I had during my stays in January were the quality of one of the rooms I had to stay in for one night and the temporary location of the Club Lounge. The hotel was sold out for my first visit and the room I was given had to have been given to some pretty rough guests as the furniture was broken and the carpets were badly stained. Dave, the hotel manager, had the room cleaned before I returned from work the next day and still moved me to an upgraded room for the inconveinience. He also treated me to an exquisite dinner in the restaurant (the warm duck salad was incredible). I truly appreciate the quality staff at this hotel who go above and beyond to provide excellent service. I can't wait to experience the new Club Lounge when it is finished. The current set-up in a suite and the previous set-up in the bar are nice but neither has had any hot food which was a great feature of the old club room.

The staff at the reception desk was exceptionally helpful, sorting out some problems for us and printing out maps when we wanted to walk beyond the hotel/airport area. The small downside is that there are no other restaurants within a short walk. It took us about 15-20 minutes to walk to a small shopping plaza nearby. That said, the restaurant on-site is appropriately casual and quite acceptable. When booking, check the web site for their \"specials\". We got the \"pay your year of birth\" for one of our nights.

My expectations for the Sheraton was low - given other airport hotels I've stayed in. Cons: The front desk staff was unorganized and not that friendly - even though I was a platinum member. When I arrived at the front desk, the attendant didn't notice that I had booked a promotional rate that included an amazon gift card and some coke products, and a plush polar bear. I had to bring it up, and then he began telling me there was no notice of it in my record. I double checked my reservation online at SPG and sure enough, it was there. Another attendant immediately took over - who said he couldn't access the promotional goods right then but told me to check in again in the morning. He was a lot more helpful - I was wondering why wasn't he working with the preferred customers - the other guy seemed indifferent and defensive. When I went to get the products and inquire about the amazon gift card in the morning the attendant told me the 'room where the products were was locked and only the manger could get them' and that the gift card would be emailed to me in 6-8 weeks - not right after my stay as I understood. I told her to not bother with the drinks, but if she could get me the plush coke polar bear I'd appreciate it. I waited for 15 minutes, and had to leave to catch a shuttle for my flight - without the plush polar bear for my daughter. I didn't get my bill print out either - Not a huge deal - but I was really looking forward to taking it home to her. I spent 15 minutes the night before, and another 15 minutes the next morning to no avail. I'll be surprised if I get the amazon gift card as promised. Pros: For an airport hotel, if you are lucky enough to get a room on the rear side of the hotel, you look over a golf course and the city skyline in the distance. If you get a room at the front of the hotel you're going to have a view of a busy street, and parking garage. Also, the rooms have a fresh decor, and the hallways and common areas were clean and well maintained. This hotel use to be a Wyndam and ithe fresh and light filledd theme compared to a lot of the dark and stuffy Sheratons I've stayed in before, was a nice change. The airport shuttle was great - both the pick up and the return went without a hitch and were really quick trips. The driver couldn't have been nicer. I had early meetings and missed breakfast. When I returned to check out and head to the airport I checked the dining room about breakfast. They had just shut down, but the waiter and the greeter got me a big bowl of fruit and some juice - and couldn't have been friendlier or accomodating. Also, I noticed the pool over looks the golfcourse and river - and loked like pleasant setting if you had a little daytime to catch a little Florida sun between flights. Overall, the building and facilites and shuttle service were better than expected - especially for an airport hotel. I wish the service at the front desk was as friendly and efficient as the staff in the dining room and the shuttle. I really wanted to take home that little polar bear to my daughter and didn't have 30 minutes of limited time trying to get the front desk to honor the promotion as promised. I'm not very hopeful regarding the amazon gift card given all the confusion at the front desk.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay near airport\u201d", "Author": "TravelerAlways1234", "ReviewID": "UR121774089", "Content": "Everything was clean and neat.

The airport transfer is efficient, but do keep in mind that the property isn't in walking distance to the airport, so you need to add time to get to/fro the airport. They bumped me up to their 10th floor (Starwood Preferred guests). It's a construction site, so I had to walk over plastic sheets of some sort to get to my room. The room was typical Sheraton, I can't complain about the basics (great bed, wireless internet access reliably worked and was complimentary for a change, excellent coffee making facilities). The trouble is that the air conditioning unit is seemingly quite old, so it made sufficient noise to wake me up several times throughout the night. What's the point of staying in a hotel room over night if the aircon wakes you up all the time! They also added another unit aimed to clean the air in the rooms (they make big hay about it, so there's an explanatory card and whatnot). I switched it off to decrease the noise levels in the room just a little. I had dinner in the bar. What a disaster. The French onion soup was ok, the chicken caesar salad an unmitigated disaster. I ended up paying over 50$ for what turned out to be a mediocre meal. The wine wasn't drinkable to be honest. I agree wholeheartedly with various guests' comments on the friendliness and professionalism of hotel staff. Everyone I met (even the guy who served the lousy food in the bar) was truly pleasant to deal with and helpful as far as that was feasible. Beware, some of the buttons on the phones (eg 'Wake-up Call') are actually dead, nobody will respond when you push the button.

I should probably wise up and quit staying at MIA airport--and stop complaining about the hotels there.

From leftover food in my room from the previous guest, to checking into a room with someone already sleeping in the bed---I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve pretty much seen it all at this airport. Maybe for that reason I was excited by the spiffy reviews for the MIA airport Sheraton. As my business often dictates, staying in the city was inconvenient so the airport it was. On first look, the Sheraton was clean, renovated and well thought out. Nice common areas, reception, rooms, gym---in truth, the entire property is good. I believe this hotel used to be a Wyndam so a refresh was obviously done. But despite the new look, the same service prevailed that is common at the local hotels. My first day they did not replace any towels and it took a few phone calls to get linens before I could take a shower. This was complemented by leftover grounds in the coffeemaker, no replacement of cups and amenities (club level) and an overall lack of cleanliness in the public areas. It seems every surface I looked or leaned upon had leftover food crumbs or something sticky slopped upon; the place was unkept. This was the case in the temporary club lounge and in the restaurant. The valet parking was the real treat as it look around 20 minutes each morning to get my car. Lots of chaos, lost ticket, lost car and twice brought me the wrong vehicle. Ever since somebody took the MIA airport Hilton and flushed it down the toilet, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a dicey proposition getting a good hotel at MIA. Maybe this is the best of the lot and I should not be so picky. As I will inevitably be back at MIA, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably end up staying here again.

It was nice the room has a robe inside with all the normal shampoos and soap with the addition of shower gel, shaving cream, and mouth wash. My only complaint was there was two sets of single serving coffee, it would be nicer to have a pot that makes two cups, but beyond that there were only enough cream and sugar for one 16oz cup, If you have two cups, let us have enough condiments for each cup :) I was very happy to have complimentary bottled water in the room, and they were drank immediately. My husband did go to get ice and the machine was out of order, other then that everything was great. And lets face it machines break down from time to time, really no biggy. I would totally stay again.

While waiting for our luggage I called the hotel to inquire about the shuttle. I said I was in baggage claim and the woman lectured me that the baggage level was not the pick up place and that I needed to go up to the departures area. She was very rude. The shuttle driver was very nice and came down and assisted my husband with the luggage. He called ahead to say that Starwood Preferred Guests were coming in on the shuttle. They rolled out the red carpet (literally) and put us in the SPG check in line. The woman at the desk said she was leaving and we would have to wait for someone else to check us in. Someone finally came. I was irritated when he told my husband that as SPG members breakfast was on the house when in reality we paid for the bed and breakfast package. We got our keys and headed upstairs. We previously stayed at the hotel when it was a Wyndham. It appeared that Starwood upgraded the furniture and TV and the King bed was very comfortable, but the bathroom was not clean and there was mildew on the old, worn tile.We paid extra for a room with a view, but the windows were filthy. We went down to the pool, but it was overrun with screaming kids so we just sat in the sun as far away from the noise as possible. When we returned to the room we noticed that my husband's credit card was not returned to him at check in. We found the person who checked us in and he had the card and gave it back to my husband. We did not have a car so we ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food and service were good. The presentation of the cheesecake and key lime was very nice and both were delicious. We also had breakfast the next morning and our server Francisco Roche from Brazil was excellent. We had the buffet, which had a nice selection, and Francisco kept the coffee, juice and water filled and we enjoyed talking with him. Francisco was the highlight of our stay at the Sheraton! We walked across the street and picked up our Hertz Car. The doorman at the Sheraton kept the key while we retrieved our luggage and checked out. The line for check-out took forever. There were only 2 people at the front desk and there were at least 5 other guests waiting to check out and at least 10 people waiting to check in.

I called the hotel and talked to someone at the front desk, who assured me that they would set my bathing suit aside for when I return to the hotel a few days later.

The Club was great with a variety of breakfast items, dinner appetizers, beverages, complimentary internet access, comfortable seating, and flat screen TVs.

We were able to keep our car there like we booked ahead of time, but they had gotten rid of the free shuttle service. No one could tell me why I called two days before check-in to confirm our reservations and shuttle, and everything was fine then. They were \"kind\" enough to call us a taxi when we asked and quoted us $24, but instead, they called us a private car service which we didn't notice there was a difference until we had to pay at the ship terminal. Thanks to Sheraton, our Free shuttle cost us $80 for a 3 mile trip!!! When we got back from our trip, we hailed a taxi at the terminal and were told AND charged $15 for the ride back to the hotel to get our car.

The maintenance man was very friendly and traced the problem to what was likely the prior guest trying to hook up something to the television. So about 30 minutes after check-in, I could finally relax. As for the room....it was just average. Standard size, mini fridge, small bathroom...nothing stood out as being extraordinary..which with the Sheraton name, I sort of expected. I should note at this point that I booked this room via Hotwire, so truth be known, I have little to complain about. The reason I review rooms is not to condemn, but because I know that hotel management reads these reviews. By sharing my experience, other guests can gauge their reaction to my troubles and perhaps report back with more positive experiences as a result. All in all I suppose I'll get a good nights sleep.

After another :15 the second bus actually stopped. The driver got out and said he was full, that I'd have to wait for the next bus (with no assurance IT wouldn't be full). Made my way through the cesspool that is the Miami airport and found the taxi line. After quite a wait in the oppressive heat I got a cab - $13 ride. At hotel. This should be good. So I give my information and confirm my preferences for quiet location and all that goes with that. I said \"is it a Pure room\"? It wasn't, even though my reservation clearly states that. I ask for a refund of the cab fare. They were about to deny it (because the driver hadn't filled out the receipt) and then Stanley appears. Stanley was doggedly determined to save the day but I had been pushed too far and was ready to leave the property and go to another. Despite my protests about not wanting something for nothing, he put me on the club level and offered me breakfast. I said \"I have two full American breakfasts on my reservation.\" Alas, like my Pure room confirmation (I had the paperwork, from the booking I had made on Starwood.com), their records didn't reflect this either. Stanley persevered, showing me the hotel amenities and graciously taking my luggage to the room. He saved the moment and did so with total professionalism, a dose of empathy, and a great sense of humor. So while I wish I could give the property a four rating, here's why it's a three - the room is quite pleasant, but the a/c is a little weak for such a hot climate. I have been in on airports hotels with better soundproofed windows, but these are just good. I had trouble getting connected to the wireless internet - when I tried to call downstairs, using the \"guest services\" button on the phone, the dialing is by pulse (vs by tone) then goes to a fast busy. I had to resort to calling \"0\". And I am set up at the desk looking for a place to plug in my laptop. Nada. I love the belt line outlets offered by so many properties. While I often stay at Starwood properties, it's been quite a while since I stayed at a Sheraton. I don't know if it's the locale, the generation, or the brand, but this experience didn't stand up for an intrepid business traveler. So to be fair, the hotel is solidly good, but Stanley does deserve FIVE STARS for his awesome handling of a frustrating situation. Commendable and a level of service that we wish was the norm, but simply isn't anymore.

The rooms are a good size, very clean with very comfortable beds and bedding. Among other things, I was impressed with the free bottles of water that are provided in the room. The bathroom amenities include most anything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need for an overnight stay and the front desk provides other essentials if needed. You can get room service if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like your breakfast to arrive as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting ready for the day. You can print boarding passes and check real-time flight status, although sometimes the computers are occupied and sometimes the printer isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t responding. There is a business center on the second floor if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a problem at the computers in the lobby. The staff is very friendly and unhesitatingly offers help when you have a need. We have not eaten in the restaurant, mainly because we usually arrive past dinner-time and instead we grab a light meal in the Vin Fiz Lounge. The quesadillas here are very good and there are other tasty options on the bar menu. We have been fortunate to be waited on by Yury Fernandez who was tending bar during most of our visits.

The hotel is OK - the only reason I stayed here was because of the proximity to the airport, it was a Starwood property, and the pool looked decent. I got a very good deal, so I think it was decent for the price. My room was somewhat dated - a good size, but everything could use a refresh. I ate a dinner and a lunch at the restaurant - the food was OK, nothing spectacular. Other guests seemed to be doing a conference or a stopover like I was. The service was pretty good - had some good help getting over to a nearby restaurant to watch a basketball game (odd that I couldn't watch it at the hotel...) - and the food at the restaurant ended up being good too. The locals are friendly and happy hour was very fun. The second day, after looking at the golf course, I decided to head down for a round. Got a great deal on the golf - rentals, plus cart, for about $60 or something like that. It was twilight pricing, but I easily got a round of 18 in. The course is called Melreese Country Club or International Links Miami - and has the distinction of being the first course Tiger Woods played as a Pro, I think. I was paired up with a gentleman in his fifties and his son-in-law - very friendly. The fairways and greens were in good condition - rental clubs were decent (Tayler made Burner irons and woods). The course was not as challenging as I thought it would be - I hit in the 90s, which reflects that it played pretty easy for a mediocre golfer (high handicapper). So - if you're in the area, and not inspired to work - go hit a round. Twilight rate was a good deal, but their visitor rate is not very good for a regular round. Overall, an OK stay - hotel could use some upgrades, but proximity to golf and airport are positives.

Check in: We did wait but not more than 6 minutes, what do you expect from a high volume airport hotel, I think the girl at the desk was proficent, informative and genuine in our check in process.

There are free snacks, internet, huge tv's, a pool table and couches. It seemed to be the gathering place which overlooked the golf course and the tarmack as well. Dinner: The restraunt threw me for a loop, I had the pasta my daughter and husband had the pork and my father had the steak. The presentation rivaled something out of a 5 diamond establishment and the taste left us wanting more, you could see the others in the restruant as well were enjoying their service. The chef came around to everyones table numerous times to see if there were any questions and how everything was. I give a thumbs up to our waiter, whom i wanted to recruit for my property, his guest service interactions were seemless!

Overall its a nice place and you can see the progress in the renovations that are SLOWLY taking place. POSITIVE: I have come across some staff memners that are truly great. Most of those work during the day hours, but if its a PH shift the seem to be quite rude. I guess its becasue the managment is not there to supervise. The hotel is without a doubt the closest property to MIA Airport. The only other hotel that is closer is the MIA Airport Hotel that is located inside the terminal. But that property is old, outdated and over priced. So at the end of the day, this property is a better option. The hotel recenly went back to the Sheraton brand and has been going thru some updated and renovations. Most of the work being done is coming out nicley and the hotel lobby looks new and fresh. But it also looks cheap and not very upscale. Perhaps when its all done it will look/feel more plush. The beds here are incredibly soft and delicious. The rooms are also very clean. There is anewly renovated finess center and a refershing pool with towels and plenty of lounge chairs. The hotel does have dedicated SPG rooms for Elite Members as well as the new Respire rooms. Internet works very well and is provided free of charge. There is also a nice work desk in all the rooms along with an ergonomic chair in the newer rooms. NEGATIVES: The property is older and has been thru several names. In the process it has lost its identity, and so, when you walk in, you dont think \"Im at the Sheraton\" . The arrival area is busy and not very nice since there is so much cionstruction going on in front and around the hotel. The parling lot is ugly. needs painting, landscaping and better signage. The entrance to the hotel is at the moment VERY dangerous as there is construction and shutle busses everywhere trying to get in and out of the airport. If you are a tourist arriving in your rental car at night. It can be quite dangerous and confusing. The valet attendants are sometimes there, sometimes not. Do not expect 4 star service here, as valet at this hotel needs some training. I used it the first time and never again. The other times I self parked. The parking lot at this hotel is outdated and ungly. It also suffers from bad signage. It is also of an extremly non guest friendly design. As if you park on the 2nd level - you need to go to the end of tha parking lot to go in to the hotel, then go up a set of small stairs (No ramp or elevator) and then go thru a LONG and non air-conditioned corridor that runs almost the entire lenght of the hotel. Where finally you can go inside the doors that open up into the Mezzanine level. Where you can then take the elevators down to the lobby for registration. The rooms are very nice and if you get a corner room (The 02 line in particular) those are very spacious. But the ones in the middle are on the smaller side. The rooms are very ncie if you get a newley remodled room. If you dont, then the rooms look and feel like 1987 all over again, including vintage popcorn ceiling and vintage dark brown wood paneling on the doors. The bathrooms have only been \"Refreshed\" even in the newr rooms and could use a complete renovation. The tiles used to be white 15 years ago. Now they are yellow ish and have layers of scum and caucking that have been accunulated over the years... The countertops and vanity are new and very nice. With black granite and excellent lighting. The towels are also of good quality as are the amenitys provided. If you get a SPG room, they provide a nice assortment of upgraded amenitys in those rooms. Front desk agents smoke at the hotels entrance and it looks terrible. The agent that checked me in one night was smokig outside and he came inside to help me. He still smelled like smoke so bad that it made me sick. This should not be allowed. Shame on the managment here for not enforcing a non smoking policy with employees in front of guests. Lasllty. there is nowehere to eat withing walknig distance. They also do not offer 24 Hour room service. This is unacceptable in a major city like Miami, in a full service airport hotel. Lastly, they charge way to much for the food and so they take advantage of the sitaution. The breakfast buffet, for example, is $21 !!! I was at the Intercontinental Hotel in Tampa, FL 5 days ago and had a much better breakfast buffet and it was only $16. Overall the place has potential. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Stay here for the location, but not the property itself. At least not until they finish the upgrades.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service\u201d", "Author": "dawil41", "ReviewID": "UR114405420", "Content": "This trip was very special to me, came down for my girlfriends birthday.the hotel was beautiful great service everyone was very nice at The front desk.food was great and I want to take the time to really thank ms.nicole carmenate for making mine and my girlfriends stay extra special.my next trip to miami I will definitely book my room with you guys again.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cwe enjoyed our stay and Geo Zeledon as great, wonderful guest service\u201d", "Author": "Bam1515", "ReviewID": "UR114232022", "Content": "My family enjoyed our wonderful stay at the Sheraton.

The Sofitel won the comparison hands-down. Tthe facilities at the Sheraton were not quite as nice (generic lobby, cafeteria style restaurant, dingy beer-soaked sports bar, and musty room), but the major failing of the Sheraton was the poor customer service. Perhaps we should not have stayed during a time when the NBA finals were in progress, but nearly the entire staff was more interested in watching the game than helping customers. We waited for the shuttle for a considerably long-time and then things only got worse. Check-in lines were 8 people deep because only 1-2 people were assisting guests and 2-3 were watching the t.v. behind the counter. The bellhops/concierge staff were also lounging around watching the game with the exception of one individual. He helped us with our many bags and told me the restaurant was open until 10:15 (we had been traveling all day and arrived late, tired and hungry). We briefly settled into our so-called \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" room and then went downstairs for dinner. We arrived at 10pm and the restaurant staff told us they were closed. Disappointed, we walked back through the lobby and mentioned to the bellhop that previously helped us we thought the restaurant would still be open. He said it should be and went to mention it to someone behind the front desk who looked to be in charge. This person turned away from the t.v. to listen, shrugged his shoulders and told us to go eat in the bar then turned back to the television. Recognizing that the beer-soaked bar packed with basketball fans was no place for my 7-year old daughter we dejectedly returned upstairs. After hunger won over and realizing that this hotel does not have room service, I went back down, waited a very long time to be served and then carried a plate of nachos (there were only 4 items on the bar menu) back to our room.

Upon my arrival, I was disappointed with a few staff--Ernesto, Sissi and another young lady on the wait staff for the CPA Conference. As a guest, I was in the Mezzanine Lounge, where there was food prepared for hotel visitors for a conference. I wasn't there to eat the food, but rather to relax while completing some school work. As such, one of the gentleman asked if I was with them at the conference to which I replied no, and he simply asked if I had eaten, and again I replied, no. Well, he then offered me the opportunity to eat with the group and I capitulated for after their time of eating. I was approached by the wait staff and told not to eat the food that they were readily going to throw away. I was livid, and told them that I was invited to eat there, and I'm certain that the hotel staff wasn't suppose to be there eating for that matter. I was approached again later in the day, and just got frustrated with the predjudice. I am a gold member, and it was just out of place to be treated that way. However, I promised to write for 5 wonderful people who made my stay grand, and they are the most outstanding staff that any resort hotel could employ. They are Scott Goldberg, Allen Crawford(?) Anna--the morning Guest Lounge Host, Jennifer, the Concierge, and Chris the security. I would be remisiced if I failed to mention the young man who works the 2nd Shift--I want to call him, Addi, but that may be wrong--He has a dog, lives in Adventura and cares for the guests on a more personal matter. He came at the very beginning of his shift around 2pm-6pm to always make sure things were okay with me, and I appreciate that. I also believes he works at the Front Desk. He'll know who I'm speaking of. I think this is a great location. It is very clean, quite and quaint. It has the ambiance of luxury hotel, but the softness of affordability and family-friendly atmosphere. After I experienced the undue treatment from Ernesto--more than once, I was grateful that Scott, Anna, Allen, Chris, Jennifer and the other young man at the Front Desk went out of their way to make me--as the customer, feel warm, welcomed and treated me with the respect that I deserved and, not to mention, paid for.

The reviews here are by and large, positive. As a result, did not expect any hiccups. In hindsight, probably weighing up the comments, people tend to stay for 1 night and often, as distressed passengers via an airline. Check in was smooth and efficient. Allocated a queen sized room. The room was large and the bathroom ample. In terms of fittings, it's a concerete building that Sheraton have added their brand to. It does not bear any resemblance to a city location. In my mind, fitting with a much cheaper brand. My horror came when I noticed the sheets and pillow cases were not ironed. I pulled back the sheet to find pubic hairs. Clearly the maid service felt the last guest had stayed only a few hours and did not bother to change sheets. At the time I noticed this, it was beyond midnight and I was not in a position to call house keeping nor the front desk. The following morning I reported this to reception who appeared shocked but made a note of it. When I returned the same evening from my work, I could not guarantee they had been changed since they still did not look freshly ironed. My second gripe. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to/from the airport only. This is no different to any of the other airport hotels. A trip to the mall is $10 with set timings. Finally, food and beverage. $22 for a doble vodka?! Seriously ! Get over yourselves. I don't pay that at the Palmer House Hilton!!! Take a look at the cost of Smirnoff Red in a grocery store. Factor in your buying power, add a reasonable mark up, but $22?! The dinner buffet. One choice of meat. What does the pasta go with? Chicken What does the mashed potato go with? Chicken A la carte was expensive, but the food enjoyable. Breakfast : Are you kidding that you charge $3 for coffee and $4 for orange juice?!?! So : 2 eggs, 1 coffee and 1 juice = $19.00 + 15% service charge + tax = $23.56 So a family of 4 having the same breakfast, staying one night between flights would expect to pay $94.24 It's an airport hotel !!!!! I hired a car : Got to/from the malls and opened up a variety of restaurant choices in the vicinity and no doubt saved - if not necessarily in terms of $ then certainly in terms of freedom and choice. A friend came to visit me from Tampa. My friend, coming to visit a paying guest was expected to pay $18 parking. Despite contacting the front desk, this was the charge. Coming to visit a paying guest? Yep. If they stay an hour, yep - $18. I was not going to argue with the front desk, because English is my first language and I don't need someone repeating my question or responding to me like I'm an idiot. Would I recommend the hotel? If your airline is picking up the tab for 1 night - Sure. Be mindful of what lurks in your bed. If it's your choice and your $? There are other options. Would I use the Sheraton Group again? Absolutely.

This Sheraton has Club lounge and they are worth every penny. Being close to the airport, there's a lot of turnover traffic with day stays and cruisers, so the lobby can get busy at times. Being SPG members helps since they maintain the SPG Gold/Plat line specifically, unlike some other properties. The room was spetacular. The beds are better than 'heavenly'. Completely supportive with individual springs so the kid's movement didn't bother at all. Plush pillows abound (4 per bed!). We had a Pur room which had an air purifier in it. Wow. Very nice touch and appreciated from my allergy prone kids. Didn't hear a plane either. The sound proofing was done very nicely. Anyone in Miami can tell you the flight path goes right over the hotel....yet only time we heard a plane was walking outside. Pool: kept extra warm....a little bit too much, but the kids loved it. Good views of the golf course and peripheral canal--which had jumping fish no less to entertain the kids. Garage: a bit of a walk, but covered and goes to the messanine level, bypassing the lobby (nice touch). Park on the 2nd level to minimize steps (4 steps) on the luggage. The parking system is a bit of PITA as it kept losing the coding on the key to let us in/out. They are used to it and the valet attendent comes running down the ramp without 30sec to assist. Extras: WiFi: free. Nice touch for a Sheraton. Fast too. Complimentary water in SPG rooms. Again, the staff is superb and friendly. Access: Road construction stinks--thanks to Miami's 10+ year airport white elephant. Best way to get here is via douglas rd (NW 37th Ave). Avoid Le Jeune unless you want to add 10min to get here.

Of primary importance is the staff, ALL of whom, from the General Manager on down, provided excellent and caring service throughout my stay. I was treated as if I were 'family'. Special thanks should be given to Lucas, Sirle, Stanley, Lorraine, Sarah, all of whom were wonderful to work with. Compliments to Raul (the hotel manager) for his generous assistance. The hotel facilities are first class. I was given a beautiful suite which far exceeded my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the rooms are, considering the proximity to Miami airport - never heard planes landing/taking off. The pool area and fitness center are inviting and are much more than adequate to satisfy my needs. The hotel's public areas are nicely designed and quite pleasant. There is a club lounge which provides breakfast and evening snacks. The evening selection is one of the best I have come accross. Thanks to Chef Frank for providing an interesting array of choices. Finally, the hotel's location provides easy access to the Miami area and beyond. I look forward to many more stays.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot that bad, but not worth any significant amount of money\u201d", "Author": "lebelgo", "ReviewID": "UR96090458", "Content": "I actually stayed at this hotel after flying into Fort Lauderdale, not MIA, because this hotel had an incredible deal for SPG points. That being said, when I rate, I try to take into account what I would have paid for the room. First of all, the hotel is convenient only to MIA airport. If you are coming from somewhere else, you better have a good GPS handy, because access is rather tricky, especially when coming from the west. I felt it was a bit chintzy to charge $20 for parking in an area where parking is very much not at a premium. No big deal, though. The greeting a reception were nice. I felt my room was perfectly nice looking, unlike a number of other reviewers. Perhaps as an SPG gold member I got a refurbished room? Everything was clean, spacious, and in working order, except the TV checkout at the end of the stay. My main complaints were: (1) The rooms were not insulated sufficiently for an airport hotel under a flight path. There was more airport noise than most airport hotels I've stayed in (which is quite a few). (2) We ordered room service breakfast which never came. We weren't charged for it, and just ended up eating out, but how difficult is it to get that right? (3) Pool area was small and claustrophobic. So for the small number of SPG points I was charged, I can't complain, but for the price they want to charge, I feel one should probably be able to do a lot better, especially if one needs to park.

I had my doubts as we pulled up outside the hotel. When walking in to the lobby it did however look very nice.

Coming up to the floor we were at the 'fresh' and new feel from the lobby was all gone. The corridors were long, dirty carpets and the roof was very low giving it a very cramped feel. The sign with the room number outside our room had also been replaced with a piece of paper with the room number on. The room was probably modern some time during the 90s but now it felt in desperate need of refurbishment. It had more the feel of like a Motel8 or something like that than the Sheraton. All the necessary things were however there (such as TV, coffee maker, desk, chairs, iron etc) so it was functional. The best thing about the room was the bed, it was comfortable and big. Other good things about the hotel was the shuttle bus (running every 15 minutes) and the location close to the airport was also good.

The hotel and the rooms are nice enough, I suppose. My husband and I had to catch a plane the next morning, so we pre-ordered breakfast, set our alarms, and thought all was well. When we got up to take showers, before our cross-country flight from Miami to Alaska, there was NO HOT WATER! I would never have guessed that a hotel that size could be out of hot water at 4 AM. We tried again later, with the same results. Then our breakfast never showed up. We tried repeatedly to contact room service and never got an answer. Five minutes before we left for the airport, the kitchen called to ask if we still wanted our breakfast, saying they had just gotten the order we put in the night before.

Also convenient is the fact that the Dolphin Mall Shuttle makes a stop at this hotel, so for those interested in shopping, that's an added feature. I am told that the hotel recently changed hands, and they obviously kept some of the fixtures from the previous ownership, but I do hope that they will address this in the short term, as things like the stained carpets in the hallways are a bit of a turnoff and detract from the overall aesthetics of the hotel.

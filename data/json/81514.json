I selected their \"Perfect Parking Package\". From my very first call to make the reservation, I could tell this hotel was extremely guest friendly. They suggested I sign up for their guest loyalty program and gave me a $10 \"Raid the bar\" voucher and asked what location of room I enjoyed, what type of pillows etc. When I arrived, I was able to easily pull my car in front of the hotel. There was a baggage person to immediately unload my luggage for me and a driver to take my car to a secure location. I was greeted at the front desk for check in by one of the friendliest agents anywhere. I was allowed an early check in as we had made good time in traffic and had somewhere to be before the usual check in time. They noticed I was in their guest loyalty program and bumped me up to a nicer room at no charge. I was given a corner room, as preferred with an amazing view of the city. While settling into my room, I heard a knock at the door and there was a kind man bringing me the type of pillows I preferred. The room was super clean and there were niceties such as a robe to use. I wasn't sure I would like the \"artsy\" decor but it was great although I understand they are remodeling. I was invited to have warm cookies in the lobby and a complimentary wine tasting in the evening. There was coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning. The most amazing part of this hotel for me was that every single person who worked there was very interested in making my stay pleasant. The valet, the baggage man, the \"pillow\" man, Scott, the front desk manager and everyone else was so professional and friendly that I will never forget that place. It is right at the gates of China Town and there is a great Irish Pub just around the corner. It is close to everything I wanted to see and do, including booking a great facial at the Aveda Institute just around the corner. For the price, I expected a clean room and parking, what I ended up with was an unequaled experience from their amazing staff. I hope to return there and also visit the other Kimpton hotels when I travel, I have a feeling they have mastered the guest experience at each of their locations.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pacifica, California", "Title": "\u201cFun + Swanky + Pet Friendly in the Heart of SF's Shopping District\u201d", "Author": "2beemo", "ReviewID": "UR127218151", "Content": "I've recommended this hotel many times to friends & associates because most all travel with their pets. Not only is Hotel Triton very pet friendly, it's super fun, super swanky & hip to boot, with a killer location. When I say they are very pet friendly, I mean it. They just don't TOLERATE pets, they warmly welcome them. If you love to shop, stay here. It's in the heart of all the shops. Also, their adjoining cafe has the best Parisian style pastries & coffee (and fashion mags!) It was my friend's birthday, and we wanted to get away from the beach for awhile, so I knew exactly what to do. I booked us (and his dog) a \"Pet Pampering Package\" room at Hotel Triton. From the minute we arrived until the minute we left, we received excellent customer service. Actually, even after we checked out, we received amazing customer service. I forgot my favorite jacket and a couture sweater there. I inquired about it after I arrived home. The staff searched the hotel & within 15 minutes, found the pieces & called me back. I had dresses for the weekend overnighted from NYC directly to the hotel, and when I called to ensure they arrived, they told me right away without even having to put me on hold that my package safely arrived. When we arrived, Vilen checked us in. All the front desk knew the name of my friend's dog (she's a retired racing greyhound). It felt to us like they were really looking forward to her arriving. Everyone came around to meet her & pet her. Vilen was so friendly & really cool. He assisted us all night long with where to go get a drink... getting us a cab etc. My friend is very particular, and Vilen got us in the most perfect room & even sent up a birthday present from the bar! When we arrived back to the hotel from our night out, Tawny warmly welcomed us back. I crashed in the most COMFORTABLE bed (omg). There even is a MP3 type stereo that plays calming music (ocean waves etc.) My friend was dealing with family drama, so he was up most the night in the lobby on his cell phone not to wake me, so he got to know the night staff pretty well and only had wonderful things to say about them. Despite his complaining about me packing 1 suitcase full of shoes & 1 suitcase full of makeup + his family drama, he ended up having the best birthday ever. Thank you, Hotel Triton!! We can't wait to come back. For the reviewers that complained about their small bathrooms, this is SF. Like NYC & Paris etc, you need to pay more for more square footage - so if you like big rooms, book a suite.

When I stumbled on the Triton during my extensive online searching, it seemed like a funky risk - either it would be completely awesome or an overblown and poorly executed dud. Talk about the former! Totally amazing, amazing, amazing! I think it is the best hotel we've ever stayed at - and we've stayed at quite a few nice ones. I joined Kimpton \"In Touch\" (their free loyalty program) when booking the room to guarantee free internet (a program perk). What a good and lucky move on my part! We arrived in the room to find a $10 mini bar coupon for In-Touch members. Moments later a hand-written note from the manager and a free bottle of wine were delivered to the room simply because I was an In Touch member. It didn't cost a thing! Talk about an awesome loyalty program. If I wasn't loyal before, I am now! The room was very cool. Small, but to be expected in a hotel located right next to the Chinatown gates in the middle of the Financial District. Still it had room for all of our things and we were pretty happy with it. Unfortunately, we didn't notice until we lay down in bed at night that our room was right next to the air handling units on the seventh floor. Talk about loud! The noise was at just the right frequency to be really annoying AND to rattle the headboard. We thought we might get by, but two seconds with our head on the pillow and I was calling the front desk. No questions asked they got us settled into a new room. The next day another hand-written note appeared in the room offering us free ice-cream for our troubles! Problems happen, but the true extent of a good hotel is how they were handled - and this was handled flawlessly. We missed the free wine happy hours because we were out exploring the city, but made good use of the very funky, artistic, lobby, enjoyed the art in the mezzanine, and asked lots of questions of the staff, who were very helpful. We loved the little hotel dog, who would stop by to greet you in the lobby. And the location was great...walk out the door and you are in Chinatown and within blocks of all the Cable Cars and a bunch of museums. The card store next store was a great and convenient place for postcards and the cafe a fine place to stop for a cup of espresso. The last night we tried to find a late night hangout and failed miserably, so instead we returned to our hotel room, opened the free wine and rang the front desk to see if we could still get that container of free ice cream. They brought it right up and we sat in the room enjoying the comfy atmosphere and our perks. I would definitely come back to this hotel and now, whenever I'm in a city with a Kimpton in it, I'll be staying there. They've made me a loyal customer. NO other hotel chain has managed that.

I'm a germophobe and used to be a hotel maid back in the day, I can tell if someones taken shortcuts when cleaning & I know most people aren't as OCD about cleaning as I am. I pulled back the sheets and checked the mattress and it was clean and in new condition. No dust flew when I did this. Again, cleanliness is important to me. It passed all of my inspections. I always carry clorox wipes and I wiped down my remote, telephone and door knobs, as a habit, but had I not, the remote still passed my visual inspection. Due to business, I always missed the wine social, however, I came in a few minutes late one day and was offered a glass before it was shut down. Which was a nice way to end the work day. The staff would hit the automatic door opener when they recognized me approaching the front door from both inside and outside. The staff greeted me each and every time I was in the hotel lobby. Asking me about my stay and if there was anything they could do for me. The staff also printed a document for me and offered to fax/scan/email it once I signed it. The Hotel Triton is located very close to Chinatown, in fact, you couldn't get any closer, it being 1/4 block from the entrance. The Hotel Triton even has umbrellas for guests to use on their outings. I wasn't in SFO for pleasure, so I was always in bed by 10pm and up at 5ish. I was located on the 5th floor and found the hotel and surrounding areas to be very quiet, the only time I heard anything was when I was in the bathroom. I did have the air conditioner on, but it wasn't clanky or loud, so don't think it hid anything. All that being said, the only thing I would change if I could would be to lower the desk. I'm petite; and if I raised the chair, my feet dangled. If I had my feet on the floor, my laptop was just a little higher than I prefer. This did not impede my ability to work at all though.

New room was a king on the front of the hotel and our girls stayed in a double nearby. Neither was big but both had all the \"right stuff', were very cool and ultraclean. Of course the lobby is very chic, passerbys peer in all day long as its so cool, wine from 5 to 6pm, great coffee and tea in the morning and a location that literally is in the middle of everything. GREAT shopping, lots of walkable restaurants, easy access to the street cars, trolleys, BART (Montgomery stop) and of course, Chinatown. What made it a '5 \" experience was the service. The 'Live like a local\" campaign is actually a grass roots effort to identify great places the workers like to be part of locally and they had great hints on what to do, We spent a good deal of time asking directions, chatting uo the wine servers, playing w/ the cute dogs in the lobby, accessing info the whole time for hints and finally a really comfortable town car ride to the airport at a taxi rate. Loved the beds and linens, the bathroom shampoo and conditioner, the $10 raid the mini bar certificate, the easy and free wifi for being a Kimpton's member and the family felt pampered, We had fun and we stayed in a very COOL place so Dad had made a great choice....", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely love this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Theresa M", "ReviewID": "UR125036887", "Content": "Recently stayed at the Hotel Triton for the 2nd time and enjoyed it even more this time!

Also, the beds are insanely comfortable. Everyone at the hotel was super friendly and helpful.

To me, it is natural that such a busy area that attracts not only tourists and other business activities would be noisy -- I don't enjoy loudness but it is normal and to be expected. It is true that oftentimes you can hear the traffic outside but I'm a sound sleeper and that didn't bother me.

Taxi drivers know it which is always a bonus. The nearest cable car stop isn't too far away and the city sightseeing hop on / hop off buses stop right outside. There are plenty of decent shops and bars close by and there's a Starbucks opposite if that's what you need to start your day. There's also a bistro on the side of the building which served decent food and drinks. The lobby is great - it's well designed and has a warm, friendly and welcoming feel when you first arrive. It was bustling and there was always plenty going on. I'm afraid that's pretty much where the positives end. The staff were friendly but not overly helpful, we had an issue with our booking that wasn't handled well by the hotel team - our booking via Expedia didn't correspond with the booking they had received and as the hotel was full we were stuck with a small twin room on the third floor, rather than a king suite. Not the end of the world but it wasn't our fault and after a long drawn out conversation, we turned down the offer a bottle of wine in the cramped bedroom and accepted their offer of a complimentary breakfast next morning. Not what we had booked, or paid for or expected. Maybe not the hotel staff's fault but certainly not mine either and I expected better handling of the situation by the staff, especially based on Kimptons reputation. I'm not one for complaining - anything for an easy life in fact - but this wasn't on. It wouldn't have been so bad if the third floor we were stuck with didn't smell so bad - kinda like how your grandmothers house might smell, y'know stale overcooked cabbage. We couldn't wait to leave if I'm honest. There were venetian blinds on the window that didn't keep the light out, the air conditioning unit was incredibly noisy and the sink wasn't in the bathroom it was in the bedroom which was both very odd and became an irritant. The beds were uncomfortable and needed changing and I'd have been more comfortable sleeping on a sack of potatoes than using the pillows. Maybe we were spoiled having just stayed at the brand new Aria Hotel in Las Vegas but this room was $60 more per night than we'd paid there and to be totally honest, if we'd only paid $60 p/night at Triton, we'd have felt that too expensive. The free internet access wasn't strictly accurate, you had to register in order to get it. Not the free high speed service we had experienced at other SF hotels. Who wants to register? Just let me get online. So, all in all if your choice of hotel is more about comfy beds than artwork on the walls of the lobby, prefer a pet-free hotel and staff that put the needs of guests first, you might wish to stay elsewhere, but to be balanced, if you want a hotel in a decent location, a nice lobby with a dog to greet you and guest house style rooms with lumpy pillows, book away, i doubt you'll be disappointed.

I went to reception and asked to move and as soon as I showed them the bites, they not only moved me, but moved me to a king suite. Great, if I wasn't now paranoid about bed bugs! I know SF is known for having a bed bug problem but I was really disappointed that even the Triton had them. That the receptionist didn't seemed shock at all is also really disappointing. In the morning when I checked out, a different receptionist commented on how few people tell them when they see bed bugs. Sorry, but that's not really much of an excuse for having them and not keeping your rooms clean!

Aparantly they have small rooms described on their website as \"perfect for the solo traveler\" that have a small full bed. I had signed up for Kimpton's rewards program to get free WIFI and I asked if we could at least get upgraded to a king room because I was a memeber and they wanted to charge me $15 more per day....there was no way my husband and I would sleep comfortably together on a full bed. After 10 minutes of arguing and getting lectured about Priceline, they finally conceeded and gave us the upgrade for free. Call me crazy but if you were going to do that why not just do it in the first place and make everyone happier....this review would have been glowing but instead they made their first impression on us a very negative one. Other than that, the stay was nice. Clean room, the front desk people were mostly friendly after that. Only thing I would suggest is to bring ear plugs if you want to sleep in because the hotel is in a great location but because of that there is a ton of street noise.

Our first impression was that of the great mural wrapping the walls of the lobby. Bright colors with amorphous designs depicting the history of San Francisco's beat, hippie, cool and cosmopolitan history and cultures. The hotel is on Grant Avenue near the city's Chinatown Gate. Good restaurant and shopping are just steps away from the hotel's big double (and heavy) double front doors. Wine and juices are served each afternoon between 5 and 6. Because Kimpton's is a pet friendly hotel chain we were entertained during the happy hour by the antics of the bell man's well behaved pet dog. Vintage movies and classic MTV videos play on the lobby's big TV screens and as soon as we walked in the hotel the vibes were set for an entertaining and fun experience. After taking the light show motif elevator to our floor the experience calms down to to reflect a more conventional older, but well kept up property. The hallways are painted in subdued colors while the hall carpeting gives thought to a wild Las Vegas casino style pattern. Sounds like a culture clash so far but believe me the designs seem to work. Our room was small but every amenity was provided. One wall was a deep red and the other three walls were painted robin's egg blue. Hotel room colors never interested me before but with this hotel chain I have learned to look for the unusual in decor. The rooms main lighting fixture was a three pronged, three color globes or orbs. I won't try to elaborate further. Service was great. Location is right down town. The room rate was very reasonable for the quality of the experience and for the location. Although we here on an entertainment only basis the hotel is just a short walking distance to the city's financial center, and a weekday morning shuttle service is provided from the Triton to the financial district. Anything negative? OK, because there are water flow devices on the bathroom fixtures the toilets run slow and the water pressure is a little low.

Also, the A/C didn't work well - the room was pretty warm and the windows opened, but not enough to make a difference. That aside, the room itself was fabulous. There were 3 different cool light fixtures in the room and everything was colorful and very funky. They managed to find room for a mini-bar and we got a $10 credit because we are Kimpton In-Touch members. The bed was comfortable and the foam pillow that I requested was waiting for me. The closet was surprisingly large - it was actually bigger than the closet in the suite we had just left in L.A. The evening wine reception is a big plus at Kimpton Hotels. The lobby of the Triton is simply groovy - it was a great place to hang out during the wine hour. There were lots of friendly guests hanging out.

In our case every room in the hotel was booked, and we were stuck with the one we got. The room was a tiny hole in the wall, clearly intended for a single person. There was only 1 robe and set of towels. We asked for a rollaway bed, in case we couldn't sleep on such a small bed. We were told we would get one, but when we returned from the theatre the rollaway bed was not there.

The decorations are bright and fun, but not tacky. The lobby is large and has a nice seating area and TV (which they played the World Cup games on, which was nice). We checked in at about 11pm, and the young man at the front desk was very nice and upbeat. In fact, every time we walked by the front desk, whoever was there would always say hello or welcome back, and seemed quite genuine. We also ordered a cab the night before we checked out, and the young man who did that for us was also very helpful and friendly. Check out was a breeze and only took about 30 seconds. When I made my reservation, I signed up to be a Kimpton In Touch member (free), which gave us free internet access and a $10 gift card for the mini-bar that came with a note from the manager. Nice touch. We booked directly through the hotel website and got the \"Stay 3 and save\" deal, which saves you 30% if you stay 3 nights or more. This put us at $135 a night. I thought this was a good deal. We were in room 721, a Deluxe Room with a queen bed. The mattress was soft, the blanket was dreamy and the pillows were feather (can be foam on request). I almost always have trouble sleeping, even at home, and I slept great in that bed. The room had two closets, a desk, a nice looking flat screen TV, dresser and mini-bar. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo and nice Aveda soaps. Another nice touch is the artwork by local artists in the room. I really liked the atmosphere and design of this hotel.

The hotel location is convenient and the staff friendly, the common areas and the rooms are slightly worn out but acceptable. The main problem is that the rooms are equipped with \"window-type\" air-conditioning units which are noisy when operating, and gives no fresh air. [N.B.: Travellers who read this review may trust my judgement as I have been belonging to the property discipline for many years.] After switching on the units at night for 2 hours, the room becomes nothing but noisy and stuffy, lacking oxygen. To open the windows for fresh air means 2 other problems: firstly, my room (and may be half of the rooms in such hotel) faces the side lane where the refuse rooms of the hotel and other adjoining buildings are located and can catch such \"unforgettable\" smell; secondly, the service vehicles and refuse-collection vehicles in US operate at nights, with their dumping and travelling noises throughout the night-time. So, the result is: \"shallow-sleeping people\" like me cannot sleep. Fortunately, it was only for one night stay, and I presume I would not be returning again unless they install some centralized ventilation system with treated air. One point worth mentioning: the hotel's web-page didn't show any \"window-type\" air-conditioning units in any of their rooms' interior photos, and \"experienced people\" like me would return to the website and find from the exterior night-view photo some ideas of the \"window-type\" air-conditioning units along the dim facades.

Doing various web searches for budget-style hotels (I'm typically a budget traveler, even staying in hostels around the world), I found the Hotel Triton to have an incredible sale. For ~$100 / night, I figure I couldn't go wrong considering the truly great location in central S.F. I wasn't wrong. Triton fulfills some major requirements that I look for in hotels: Proximity to public transit to/from airport (only a few blocks walk from Montgomery St. BART Station and even close to cable cars and certainly many bus lines), price, and wireless Internet (it's even free). It's central location is the major bonus for me. The hotel is a small-ish boutique hotel right across the street from the Gates of Chinatown, and within walking distance of North Beach, the Financial District, Tenderloin, etc. It is a bit of a haul on the electric trolley or Muni to the Castro - but I only went to the Castro once or twice. Most of my time was spent sightseeing the central areas of the city, and happy hours in North Beach (Vesuvio is an absolute must). Yes, my room was small and my window looked onto an alley - though I didn't spend much time in my room. I was visiting San Francisco to explore the wonderful city, not the insides of a hotel room. In fact, the staff let me bring a bike that I had rented into my room for safety. The afternoon wine reception was nice (and free), though the wines were, of course, not the best quality (read: free). One complaint - the 2nd day I was there, the maid did not replace my bath towels. I only had one towel out of 2 left. Not the end of the world, but I had rented the bike and needed to shower when I was done with riding for the day (riding up and down those hills can make a guy sweaty), so I had to use my last towel to shower that evening and then use the same one the next morning.

Cafe de la Presse next door did a good hearty breakfast, but here's a tip for those of you who can't take a big meal first thing - we would often trot down to the Westfield Centre on Market Street and buy a yogurt from the Bristol Farms store in the basement, and a Peets coffee to accompany it. There's plenty of seating and it's a good place to plan your day ahead. Some more tips: the MUNI pass was fantastic value. Buy yours from the Dick Dale fan in the booth near the cable car turnaround on Market Street. Go to Sausalito on the ferry if you can. What a gorgeous place.

We loved the bright, fun, but tasteful decor, zany bed heads and furniture, light fixtures, and exhilarating bathroom with good powerful shower. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the two double beds with their luxurious pillows were the most comfortable hotel beds we've experienced in a hotel. The bathrobes were also a nice touch and although we didn't buy one, we were sorely tempted! We liked being able to open the window to fresh outside air as well as having access to an air conditioner, and appreciated the obviously environmentally-friendly policies (recycling, \"green\" products, re-using towels if willing, etc.) the hotel follows. They even welcome pets! As we drove through the night and then spent the entire day walking our feet off in the city prior to checking in, the Triton provided just the comfort and fun atmosphere we craved. True bliss! Crazy-bright decor and furniture in the lobby with complimentary wine in the late afternoon and good coffee in the morning, a bustling cafe next door and a Starbucks across the street, the entrance to Chinatown a few steps away, and helpful staff on reception at all hours made our stay most memorable.

Usually we object to the high cost of valet parking in the city and choose to leave our car in the Union Square underground parking garage and walk to our hotel, but this time we made the right decision, leaving our car with the Hotel Triton valet staff. For only a couple of dollars more (plus tip which they deserved!), our car was whisked away, in an out privileges were available (not available at Union Square at the less expensive 24-hour rate), and they even let us park outside the hotel on the street for a little longer so we could walk to the Museum of Modern Art area where it's really hard to find parking.

My husband wanted to try somethong new and quirky for our friends 26th birthday (we usually stay at the mark hopkins) so we chose the Hotel Triton, because we had walked by and knew its in a GREAT location, and its a kimpton and weve stayed at The Hotel Monaco in Seattle many times...So we get two \"Celebrity Suites\" I think they are $359 per night each. After viewing the rooms online, we request the King Triton suite and the Hagen Daz suite....So we get to the hotel at 11pm or so and check in, it is me my husband and one memmber of the other party. The guy was really nice and told us all about where to eat and drink nearby, and the lobby is cute and they have rubber duckies ion the fountain. So the three of us and the hotel worker go up to our room (the other room comes later) and we get in the King Triton suite (supposedly the BEST room they have) and it REEKS like smoke....and someone had put plastic wrap all over the smoke detector...so he brings us air freshener and opens the windows (which look out on some weird wooden scary platform and other rooms) anywayz the room is BEYOND tacky (i have stayed at an adult theme motel before....and really it was better) there are mirrors everywhere, and a bright red light in the tub room (also tub is small one person jacuzzi like the size youd have in your bathroom at home). Also as we walk down to meet the other person, we start to nitoce more and more how the whole hotel is so obviously a former crack motel that they tried hard to make pretty...sagging floors, peeling wallpaper and paint....dirt in weird spots...weird staircases...So its like 1145 now and our friend has parked in front of the hotel and is getting out....we all walk back in. No employees in sight, finally my husband searches one out, and they check her in...she has the hagen daz suite....we go into check it out...MUCH BETTER ROOM than the kinf tritin suite.....much newer and much more care put in (still some uneven paint etc) has very cute fully stocked (free) freezer....the bed rattles tho every time you move even a bit....definitely a nicer room though....so she realizes the pillows are all down and she needs foam...we take the elevator of hell (it randomly goes to unrequested floors and stops) down to ask for some.....\"sorry we gave them all away\" were told.

No street noise, but I did turn on the fan for some \"white noise\". The room was pretty modest in size, but very quaintly decorated. I loved it. The bathroom needs some shelving/wall storage next to the sink. The bathroom is small and counter space is minimal, so shelving would have helped. Towels are great - plentiful and fluffy. The TV is pretty small. Someone in another review mentioned a flat screen TV being a good addition and I agree. The honor bar had some good stuff in it, but high prices as typical for something like that. The business center is a desk next to the check-in counter. Very fast and nice computer though - at $5.99 for 15 minutes of internet time. Doooh.... In the morning, there is complimentary coffe/tea in the lobby. No food.

This stay was business for my husband, but pleasure for me, so this reveiw takes both perspectives into account. We are in our mid-thirties, used to live in SF, and like staying at nice hotels, but not stuffy hotels - so we chose the Triton over the W or the Clift. As previous locals, we would have stayed in another neighborhood if it weren't for the conference (staying downtown can be intense), but since we were here for business for him - it worked out great. Positives: -The Triton hit our criteria of staying where other folks our age stay, not being stuffy, and being within walking location to transit (great bonus for heading out to dinner in other neighborhoods) and the convention at the Moscone Center - perfect. -Our room was between a maid's closet and a stairway, so was very quiet. We were here over a weekend and during the week and I never heard anyone partying or being loud. -FREE Coffee in the morning in the lobby was awesome. When you travel a lot it is a pain to have to shower and run down the street for coffee every morning for a week. It was so nice to bop down to the lobby to get some free organic coffee that tasted pretty good. -Small fridges in the room so you can get yogurt and water, etc. and keep it in the room is a huge plus. Nice to have breakfast for yourself to cut down on the eating out 24/7 (even though it is heavenly SF). -Staff was nice and helpful. One thing though - they forgot our 3:00 am wake-up call and 4:00 am taxi, but it worked out. -Huge bed - I barely knew my husband was there. Negatives: -I took an earlier review into account and asked not to stay along the alleyway (good call), but our room was facing the courtyard and had absolutely no view. I think I would prefer to be along Grant or Bush. -We didn't book for the decor - which online looked obnoxious, and it was, but that's okay. -Our room was small. We looked in some other rooms which seemed a bit bigger, but we decided it being quiet was a trade off for size. -The decor needs to be updated. The room seemed worn. This hotel could really be served well to update itself. I hate it when the bathroom grout is grey/black and all the floorboards are beat up, the wall paper is peeling, etc. Though our housecleaning was great - the room just seemed like it could be cleaner. We stayed in an ECO room and the carpet is the same we have in our house, but it was time to replace it. The little rugs were kind of nasty. If you are walking around SF you really need to take your shoes off in the room, they should have a shoe tray by the door to help emphasize that. Overall, I would stay here again because the positives outweigh the negatives, but I would investigate other places first. We like places that are a little cleaner and a little better updated. If you are used to the Ritz, don't stay here - if you like a funky edge, the smell of cannabis floating through the halls, seeing healthy young American's and European's, and an overall good location for downtown business, then stay here.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIf you want to sleep don't stay at the Triton\u201d", "Author": "BARNESLONDON", "ReviewID": "UR6940709", "Content": "The Triton is awful - shockingly bad. Having read Time Out's review and some on this site we booked for three nights. Arriving in San Francisco with our young kids and full of high hopes, we stayed for just one night and couldn't get out quick enough. OK, it's in a good location, has a quirky reception and groovy carpets, but that doesn't make a good hotel. It's cramped, dated, tired and ill-equipped. The idea you may \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bump into Cher or Courtney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here is laughable. Perhaps they did once stay here a long, long time ago but I bet they never came back.. Pete Doherty would probably like this place. Here's five things we particularly hated about it. 1. Small rooms - the first room we were shown had two small beds (double double) crammed in, leaving no room to even open a suitcase. All the bathrooms we saw were tiny. 2. Grotty decor - we were then moved to the 'Gerry Garcia suite' for an extra $100, which looked like it was last cleaned 15 years ago. Gerry must have been very stoned when he 'designed' this room, as the only 'design' was a poorly painted nicotine brown chequer board effect on the walls. It looked like a crude stage set. Were the floral curtains and (greasy) headboard borrowed from Gerry's mum's house? Gloomy lighting, chipped paint, knackered furniture, worn carpets - it had it all. We accepted because we couldn't face moving again with young kids after a long journey but it was pretty grim. What constitutes a suite? This was one medium size room with a double and sofa bed. 3. The noise from the rubbish trucks at 10pm, 3am and 4am, right outside the hotel was deafening and unbearable. It woke us all up, and just as we got back to sleep another one would crash around, reverse lights beeping, crushing glass bottles just below the window. It turns out that the street next to the hotel houses all the bins for the street's shops and bars, but god knows why they needed to empty them so many times during the night. And why the hotel doesn't invest in triple-glazed windows to keep the sound out is beyond me - I can't believe anyone would experience that level of sleep deprivation and stay a second night, let alone come back or recommend to a friend. They knew full well about this but still proceeded to put us in this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 quite happily. 4. The staff - nice and well-meaning but not great on service. We asked for a babysitter, and the guy at the desk spent an hour looking before giving up. Only he didn't bother telling us that he hadn't found one, and when I went back to ask him if he'd found one he said he'd been looking on Google but couldn't find one! At this point it was too late in the evening and we had to take our tired kids out to dinner with us. Maybe they're not used to children, but they're part of the Kimpton Group, so all he had to do was call a sister hotel for their recommendation. Also, our DVD player didn't work and the guy they sent up couldn't fix it and really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what he was doing. And the wireless log-in didn't work, so I had to call the support line. At this point I was getting pretty cheesed off with the place. When we complained about the noise the following morning the manager nodded knowingly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ah, yes, the garbage trucks..beyond our control I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 5. There's no bar, and no restaurant. Yes, there's a bistro next door, but it's hardly the same as being able to pop downstairs for a drink at the bar. The 'wine-tasting' comprised a few bottles of cheap Banrock Station (Australian!) Chardonnay and a couple of bottles of Zinfadel - hardly the introduction to Californian wines I was expecting! After our night of disrupted sleep we stumbled down to reception to make our complaints, and to their credit they reimbursed us the extra $100 we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d paid and moved us to the (excellent) Argonaut, a sister hotel and part of the Kimpton Group. This we highly recommend and was great for the kids. The Triton needs some serious investment to bring it up to scratch.

The hotel remedied that when I requested for them. The hotel was a good value- great location (next to Chinatown, steps from shops, close to the BART/MUNI/cable cars), nice perks such as morning coffe & tea, newspapers, fresh apples, cookies.

Music plays in the lobby, but it was inaudible in my 2 nd floor room. At the intersection outside my window, the crosswalk has a textured pavement, so there was a rough grinding noise every time a car went by, but the air conditioner on low speed provided enough white noise to mask the traffic noise.

My family got a taxi couple of times. The hotel staff was courteous enough to hail a taxi for us. Also, the cafe was closed during our stay but we had easy access to some very nice breakfast places.

Upon a few conversations with the staff, I was upgraded to a room with two double beds and one with a king bed without any problems. The rooms had a view of chinatown and did not have any noise issues. Upon reading previous reviews of this hotel, I had requested them not to give me a room that faces the alley and my request was met without any hesitation. The hotel staff had already told me that the rooms were about 14 by 11 in size so the size of the rooms was not a surprise to me. I admit that the rooms could be a little more updated.

Made the reservation with a very personable woman at the actual front desk of the Triton. Personally, I much prefer to make reservations with the actual property which I intend to stay, as opposed to the move by hotels recently to have to make reservations thru a central reservation service which is usually not at the property at all. [How I came across the Triton was because of the lock-out that several of the major hotel chains have imposed on their once-striking workers. After booking a suite at The St. Francis, I found out that it was involved in the lock-out. Given that I will not cross a picket line of workers who have been locked-out of their jobs because I agree with the workers, I had to find an alternate hotel which was not involved in it. Fortunately, thru internet research, I came to hear of the Triton.] Upon checking in, the same woman, Andrea, who had assisted me in booking our reservation, was at the front desk. She was quite helpful in describing the accommodations at the hotel as well as the surrounding area. When we arrived, there were fresh, hot cookies at the front desk. The hot cookies appear twice a day. Also, they host a nightly wine tasting in the lobby, along with Tarot card readings. Fun way to interact with some of the others staying there, if you so desire. We then went up in the funky/modern elevator to 'The Graham Nash Suite,' which was delightfully decorated using Mr. Nash's own personal memorabelia from his career with Crosby, Stills, Nash (and sometimes Young!) as well as being one of their eco-friendly rooms. Wonderful idea! There was a bottle of mint infused water on the desk at no charge. Glad I tried it! Pleasant change from the usual bottled waters! The only downside was that the suites that I am accustommed to staying in have two separate rooms...a bedroom and a living room. This suite was one large (compared to the regular sized rooms which we saw while passing the housekeeping staff when they were in cleaning them) room with a couch and chair, etc, along with the bed all in the same room. The Gates of Chinatown are directly across the street, so we had an incredible...and inexpensive...meal of dim sum that evening. We were so pleased with the quality of the ingredients that we ate at various restaurants there throughout our stay. I've never eaten so well for so little in any city before! We never ordered any room service, so can't comment on that aspect. The central location of the hotel was a plus. Union Square is right there one street over. Our trip to San Francisco was to check out different neighborhoods and apartments for my daughter, who is planning on moving there. When the staff heard that we were looking into where best for my daughter to live, they gave us their personal opinions concerning the city's various neighborhoods, etc. That was most helpful, as we were not familiar with the difference in the neighborhoods there. By the end of our stay, my daughter had found a lovely, albeit small, one-bedroom apartment in a secure building with a fabulous view. The room was just fine, the bed very comfy, the decor definitely one-of-a-kind, good shower pressure (an important point for those of us who frequently stay in hotels!), and the staff was the best! I reccommend the Triton for anyone who tires of the usual \"same ol' same ol\" hotels. The only down side was the lack of a view, as our 'suite' was not facing a street, but rather an alleyway. However, since we were gone most of our stay, it didn't matter much this time.

It looks great from the outside and the lobby. It is right at the entrance to Chinatown, and next to Cafe Presse and my favorite card shop, Advantcard. The decor is really fun, in a funky college student kind of way, and there are some nice touches like candybars in the minibar-like offers in a tray in the room. But: The room was terrible. It was one of the inner rooms facing a rather depressing courtyard deck. (I never saw the outside rooms so I don't know if they are any better but San Fran is usually cloudy so the more light the better I say). The room was very dark and extremely tiny. The window AC unit blocked a lot of the light coming in the small window. And the room was very small, so small the bed dominates most of the room. Even with the 2 of us standing with a weekender suitcase each, the room felt very, very crowded. The room (not including the bathroom) was literally the size of 2 office cubicles. I'm really not kidding here. There was absolutely no space to open a suitcase. There was a luggage rack but no place to unfold it, unless you blocked the door to the room or the door to the bathroom. The bathroom was also very tiny and a little worn looking also however they did try to dress it up a bit with some luxury anementies. But the thing that I didn't like the most about the Hotel Triton is, unfortunently, the service. They just didn't care. Our room had a connecting door to another room on one side and there was not any insulation between the rooms, these are just standard doors. There were a bunch of guys, and gathering from the conversation, from Iowa for a few days having a bachelor party for a guy named Steve marrying someone named Robin. We could every single word of there conversation through the door and across the courtyard since we shared the corner together. Even heard them break a glass and set another one down on a tabletop. Its not like we were even trying to hear it. We put the AC on, the TV on, and were lying in bed. It was very uncomfortable. All the other stuff, we thought we could live with but this was a bit much. We went down to request getting moved. And the desk person said that she wouldn't move us and that the Hotel Triton rules doesn't allow parties. We told here there was definately a party. After arguing with us about if this party actually exists, she told us she would tell them to clear out. We didn't want that, after all the guy was getting married, and again, we just asked to be moved. She called the manager, who said that they couldn't move us, wouldn't tell us why, just something about booking rooms in advance. Very puzzling. Anyway, we decided to live with it and stayed in the room and spent our San Fran trip avoiding going back to the room until late at night. That's fine, plenty to do in San Fran. One last suprise, on checking out, there were 2 phone calls on our bill! Considering that we both carry cellphones and knowing the cost of hotel phone service we honestly NEVER made one phone call from our room didn't even pick up the phone to call the front desk, just walked on down to the lobby. Weird. The girl at the counter argued with us about the phone charges! My husband and I kept insisting that we didn't call anyone in San Fran (my friends all live in the East Bay). She said well maybe you called a restaurant. But we didn't make any reservations either. Finally my husband says, we didn't make ANY calls, call the number and see, maybe it was the person before us. She, rather angrily calls the number and nobody answered. Finally they just take it off our bill. But the whole time the women looked very mad like we were trying to scam her. When the taxi came to pick us up, my husband says \"I tried to be a good sport about this hotel room but that was the last straw. Why would we want to scam her out of $4.00?\" A few other things: The doors used real keys, not electronic cards and don't keep changing the door locks so there is the security issue. The chocolate chip cookie in the lobby were very good. The location in hindsight isn't the great for real tourists, in my opinion. Fisherman's Wharf although garish, is probable the better choice, all the tourist activities seem to begin and end there and because its full od tourist its busier at night time. Our hotel's street was full of homeless people at night. Anyway, FYI, we are both 33 years old. We heard mixed reviews about the hotel before we went and I can see why. We found it to have a cool glamourized Youth Hotel vibe. Great for college students, I think but NOT great for more mature adults. I would have been ok staying there with a friend for a night but not with my husband. My parents would have hated it, not for the decor but for the cramped quarters and other issues, not worth the price. I suggest instead, staying at The Argonaut Hotel, which is another boutique hotel, in Fisherman's Wharf. Our friend's stayed there and it looked very nice. It's got a nautical theme, its newly renovated, the rooms are bigger and it seems to be cheerful and cleaner. Hope this helps everyone out there make an informed decision.

However.. the hotel was centrally located for excursions into Chinatown and Union Square!", "Date": "June 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cYes, that bad!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2132785", "Content": "I visit San Francisco at least 10 times a year for business and I always stay at the Hotel Palomar which is under the hotel group, Kimpton. The Kimpton Group usually meets my standards when it came to Hotel Palomar or their restuarants. I decided that I would stay with the Hotel Triton because I saw all the great reviews coming from this site and when I checked their website I was impressed with their theme and their style. I was automatically greeted at the door. It was early morning and my eyes were focused on their breakfast set up (coffee, tea). No one was at the frontdesk. I waited for a couple of minutes so I got some coffee first. Once someone got there they were ready to get me out. Alright, I understand that it's fairly early and \"we\" have yet to wake up, but come on! The lady was too quick and I'm sure she wanted me out of there as fast as possible. I go up on one of their two elevators and go to the room. I had a great room with the most comfortable bed. The room was very simple with a splash of pizazz. I was satisfied with the rooms. Thoe housekeepers were very attentive and helpful with additional ammenities I requested. When I called downstairs for a wake-up call they didn't answer till I called the 3rd time. When I checked out a few days later in the morning I had the same young lady help me. She seemed to continue the same attitude as she did when I checked-in. A lot of blank stares and I felt as if I was pushed out. Throughout the day I the staff was perfect. If I decide to stay there again (not likely) I would come in the afternoon. I enjoyed the cookie!", "Date": "June 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Triton - a Kimpton Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81514-Reviews-Hotel_Triton_a_Kimpton_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$184 - $369*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">342 Grant Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81514", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/55/c2/55c2aa142b2fe7ccd0c93f9eb5f13e2d4large.jpg"}}

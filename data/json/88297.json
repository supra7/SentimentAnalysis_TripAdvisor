From the minute we walked in throughout the week, everyone from the people working at the front desk, the cleaning staff, maintenance staff and activities people. ANYTHING we needed they provided with a smile, and even offered to add additional activities when it was raining, to keep the children entertained. We had 3 two bedroom units with 10 adults and 7 small children in our group. The rooms are a little small (except for the master), but we figured for being on the beach we didn't need huge rooms because we spent most of our awake time outside. VERY cleanm units, and comfy beds too. The kids (big and little) enjoyed the hula hoop contest, water balloon contest, corn hole, slushes and ice cream (small extra fee for the slushes and ice cream ) by the pool. We missed many of the activities while swimming, but many more were available. The Dive in Movies was a hit with the kids and the Beach Party with DJ was GREAT time. Being that I am a late nighter, I can tell you it was very comforting to see security walking the property at all hours from the floors to the pool to the parking lot. No free Wi Fi in the rooms, but there is in a couple areas of the hotel. The ladies at the desk said when the hotel was last renovated it wasn't wired for Wi Fi but will be during upcoming renovations. I am a very picky person when it comes to hotels, and I would happily stay at this one again. :) Italian resteraunt across the street was pretty good, and Crabby Joes on the pier, and Aunt catfish's was REALLY good and not too far, but expect a wait to get in.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Vacation Spot\u201d", "Author": "Anne M", "ReviewID": "UR133426641", "Content": "We stayed at the Dayton Seabreeze in June 2012 (week of tropical storm Debbie).

We stayed in both a one bedroom and two bedroom for the first leg of our trip. Our 2 bedroom was on the 4th floor with great views, the walls must be thick as we did not have any noise disrupptions (nor did we cause any). The one bedroom on floor 2 did have a bit of a musty smell but this could be caused by humidity as well (the water pressure was great on the 2nd floor and OK on the 4th). The property has free laundry facilities located throughout and we were lucky enough to have one right next to our 4th floor room. The elevators were a little slow so we opted to use the steps whenever we could. Everything you neeed is fairly close restaurants, CVS/Walgreens, groceries at Publix. Daytona has a great bus and trolley system as well. Be sure to check out Crabby Joe's on the pier (less than 2 miles on the A1A) for breakfast surprisingly inexpensive and very tasty. One bedroom was a little small as we had 3 sharing, but it did the trick.

The Activities Director, Starr, was also very friendly and helpful. What we really liked/appreciated: *clean, large, beautiful, private beach just a few steps away! *pool/beach toys & boogie boards available in a poolside box - awesome perk! *beautifully landscaped pool & grilling area - felt very tropical & fun *great kid/family activities *pleasant decor *very comfy king-size bed *pool & deck very clean; lots of chairs *separate kiddie pool * pool towels available (but they didn't tell us until the 4th day we had to let them know when we returned them into a dirty towel hamper. they actually mark it on your account that you returned them.) *free computers/internet access in the small library *located away from the \"busyness\" of Daytona Beach but only a couple minutes to drive to shopping/restaurants *family friendly atmosphere *close to Harbour Lights restaurant - fantastic & fun place to eat! *good selection of cable tv channels What we didn't like/appreciate: *master bedroom was largest room in the unit - everyone tended to congregate there *2nd bedroom extremely small *sleeper sofa extremely uncomfortable *only a 2-burner stove top & no oven (we have food allergy issues so it is best if can cook our own meals. difficult to cook for family of 5 w/2 burners. there was a convection oven/microwave combo which was a pain) *had a brief thunderstorm and ended up with 2\" of water in the entryway and front bathroom. it came in under the front door. used all our bath & beach towels trying to keep it from soaking the carpet in the living area. husband ended up having to get a mop from maintenance to clean up. *bathrooms both small & only had pedastal sinks. no space to store anything except one small shelf above the sinks. *game room was not worth going into (which can be good or not, depending on whether you like to spend money on that kind of thing.) *laundry room located on only 2 floors. luckily, we were on a floor that had a laundry room. Overall, this is a great resort for families who want a low-key vacation where you can relax and enjoy spending quality time together in a comfortable atmosphere.

The check in process was smooth and quick. They told me about the resort, amenities and local attractions that all came in handy. I had to book my vacation in 2 different reservations and they were so accomodating in helping my room be a stayover instead of moving rooms midstay. The lobby was beautiful and spotless!! As soon we entered the lobby I knew this was going to be a wonderful vacation. I was greeted by a friendly sales staff that was not pressuring at all to tour. If i had more time, would have loved to hear the presentation however I dont get that much time from work and was going to take advantage of every minute of this stay. However, they did greet me with refreshing lemon water. (plus while speaking to them, all I could see was the beach in the view behind them that was calling my name!) Our room was close by the elevators which i loved the easy access to. Upon entering the room, It smelled fresh and clean and felt light and airy with the sun shining in from the 2 balconies! I really liked the new decor. The room was spacious and slept 6 comfortably!! The king bed in the master bedroom was sooo comfortable!! I slept like a baby! The curtains blew up from the AC but I solved this by placing towels on the ledge so i could sleep in without the sun shining in. Although, a few mornings, I slept with the curtains open to see the sunrise from bed!!! AWWWWW perfection!! We spent most of our time at the beach in front of the hotel and met a wonderful business owner named Tom from Greg's Beach rentals (email me and I will give you his info if you want it) They provided umbrellas, chairs and even a tent if you wanted it!!! We used them every day and it was all set up by 9am each morning!!! The pool was great too!! We loved the entertainment!! that was the best and the activities team did a great job!! So much enthusiasm!! My only sadness was missing the dive in movie that is my favorite at Bluegreen properties but I had to leave so that was my fault! I did enjoy the smores at the bonfire !!

It has been updated somewhat but I would have to say the interior of the units are just average. Nothing special. We had a two bedrm unit with two baths. The master bedrm is very large and the secondary bedroom is very small. The living rm had a sofa sleeper. Our son slept there and didn't complain so I guess it was fine. The other beds were comfortable but the problem for me was that the unit was easy to cool down but the humidity never left the room. The rooms have the a/c units like a hotel (under the window.) They do not remove the humidity very well. The kitchen is a full kitchen with a two burner cooktop but very small. My major complaint is that the bathrooms have pedestal sinks with only a small shelf above the sink to sit items. Both bathrooms in the unit were exactly the same. Not much room for all your bathroom stuff. It was just a nuisance. The only other thing that bothered me was that the living room was interior meaning no windows. It was nice to be beach-front but the windows and balconies were both located in the bedrooms. Kinda felt like a dungeon when you were sitting in the living room. Not that we stayed in the unit much but when you were in there, you didn't get that \"being at the beach\" feeling. The location in Daytona Shores was the best part. There are many places to eat and shop if you go North. The Ponce DeLeon Lighthouse was very nice to visit as well. Be prepared to climb many stairs and if you don't like heights, don't tackle it! I've posted a few pics. As far as the value, we traded thru RCI to stay here. I was amazed to see that they have it listed as a Gold Crown resort.

There was quite a bit of small debris in the water that was never skimmed out that we saw. The housekeeping staff is great except they kept bringing us hand towels instead of wash clothes.

This resort is in an excellent location and is away from the busier part of Daytona. This is a bonus for the resort because the hub of Daytona seems more crazy for families with children. The Seabreeze is located on the south end of Daytona shores and is close enough to Ponce Inlet and other major roads, as well as some quick drives to many restaurants. The beach outside the resort is often uncrowded and it is obvious this is a family friendly part fo Daytona. The resort itself is great for its location and the resort staff are very friendly. When you walk in the lobby you will notice several sitting areas and the activities desk, front desk, and manager's desk. In addition, the game room, library with internet access and activities room are all on the first floor. The pool is also a short walk around the corner and teh front desk will provide towels if you ask. The nice thing about this pool is it was never too crowded to enjoy and the resort allows the use of pool toys (they also have a tub full of pool flotation toys and boogie boards they allow you to use). Adjacent to the pool is the tiki area, equipped with grills, several areas to sit and eat, and the fire pit. This is all lit at night and at any time you can request the grills to be turned on for your use. The rooms are very nice, however, one must not be too quick to compare them to the Fountains in Orlando. Each Bluegreen resort offers something different and the Daytona Seabreeze's selling point is the beach. That being said, the rooms are spacious enough and are equipped with a full kitchen. This is an added bonus for saving money, as eating out every night gets expensive. One word of caution though, if you are going to purchase groceries for your stay avoid Publix (unless you like spending alot of money). Winn Dixie is not as pricy and is only a few minute drive past Publix. Anyway, the rooms in this resort are either one or two bedroom. We had the one bedroom and even with the 5 of us we never felt cramped. The bedroom has a king sized bed and its own tv and a balcony. The living area has a pull out sofa with a tv and a smaller sofa to the side that could easily sleep a small child. The kitchen is small and sits 4 but if you are like our family, we did most of our eating on the balcony enjoying the beach. Also, all rooms are oceanview. Overall, this resort made for a great family destination for us. Previously we had negative feelings about Daytona because of being in the busier section but our stay here changed that. We loved the location, the friendliness of staff, the resort feel, and above all the beach. The only negative we could find is that the pool and tiki area closes at 10pm.

Beach was nice, clean, not at all crowded. Take advantage of umbrella rental on beach to keep cooler and extend time in sun ($25/day for umbrella, 2 chairs, table). Fun kid activities available as is game room for tweens/teens. Pool was great for young ones still learning to swim - 3 feet deep in shallow end. Very pretty too, with tiki torches lit up at night. Also a grill area. Only yuck factor was having to go to the 'time-share salesperson' to get your free parking pass so they can try to schedule a sales pitch appt.

I was disappointed though, that the pool closed at 10:00. We never got to enjoy the hot tub in the evening because it was always close to, or after 10:00pm, when we got back. I always forget when we go to Florida, that you must buy your liquor at a liquor store, and that most of them close fairly early. Being from Michigan, we are used to running into CVS and being able to buy all of the beverages we like to have on hand (milk, pop, juice and liquor) It would be very nice if the resort rented or had even those cheap $12-$16 folding loungers to take out on the beach. The Maverick in Ormond Beach had them and it was sooo nice to be able to use them and not pay a fortune. I believe all condo's should supply certain things like salt & pepper, & more than one days worth of sugar & creamer. The one bedroom condo we stayed in had one of the largest balconies at the resort and a very nice view.

The water pressure was excellent. Lots of hot water! And everything was clean! The \"library\" where the computers were was very nice, too. We just put our dirty towels outside the door in the laundry basket and new ones were supplied. We only had to do this once, as there were plenty of towels for just the two of us.

There is a firepit, grills, a pool and hottub outside. You can't drink out of glass bottles at the resort outside or on the beach. The pool and hottub closed at 10 while we were there and the security walks around a lot on the resort to enforce this and the beach patrol on the beach enforce it there, too.

We stayed in a 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit for one week, and enjoyed our stay very much. We found the Sea Breeze to be very well-managed with friendly, helpful, professional staff. I didn't see any mold or rust anywhere, although there were some water stains (?) on one bathroom door. When Bluegreen bought the Surfside Inn a few years ago, they gutted the interior and rebuilt it with larger suites. Hurricanes in '04 stole some of the beach, and the Army Corp of Engineers was scheduled to come and replace some sand from offshore - but Katrina changed those plans. However, in the past two years, 20 feet have already been naturally replaced. We thought the beach was quite wide, with a nice very gentle slope. During our stay, we compared beaches to our north and south. To the south (New Smyrna), the sand was grittier and there was much more traffic, people. To the north (Daytona), the sand might have been softer but there was more trash and people. Our sand was \"perfect\" and clean, and there were never very many people. We had a lifeguard right behind us, from 10 to 6. My only complaint about our beach was that several non-stinging jellyfish-things washed up just before we arrived (looked like clear silicone breast implants!), and one morning there were several sandcrab-things and little fish coming in with the shallow waves - ugh! At least nothing stung/pinched, and our kids enjoyed catching/releasing the sandcrab-things. The day before we arrived, a man had to be rescued from a rip-tide, so be careful!! We were told most dangerous rip-tides occur in the spring (?). It was nice having the grassy lawn, and the shaded pool in the afternoons. The resort provided several toys and floats for everyone to use, along with towels. The swimming pool was warm, and the hot tub was HOT. In the evenings, the fire pit and torches were lit, and music was always playing. Across the street, there was a Drive-In Christian Church (interesting!) and a great beach/souvenir shop where we purchased umbrellas at a good price. A Wal-Mart Super Center and a Super Target weren't too far away. The resort offered several daily activities like crafts/bubbles for children, pampering sessions for women, sand-castle contests or root beer floats, breakfast buffet for families. It is in the process of adding a library, and (I think) an exercise room. There was a small room with a few arcade games and an air-hockey table, and there were \"secret\" decks on the second and third floors. Due to water conservation laws, each suite did not have its own washer/dryer for clothes, but there were free laundry rooms on each floor. I never saw a bug or mosquito! Our suite was roomy enough, but there didn't seem to be enough storage space for things like our groceries in the kitchen, toiletries in the bathrooms, and our sandals/towels/cooler in the entry-way. Water-pressure was okay, not great but not terrible. Our master bed was very firm, and the bottom sheet/pad kept persistently slid off the top corners (grr). The balcony railings were safely-spaced about four inches apart, and very secure. However, the dining table/chairs were not good for small children, because they have no backs (we moved our set to seat the children against one wall). The resort didn't have high chairs - but they did bring us a crib, for the baby to sleep in. We had 3 TVs and 1-2 stereo systems. Each bedroom had its own air-condition unit under the window, and a regular door out to its own balcony. The master bedroom was the size of the second bedroom and living room combined. We never heard any neighbors - good walls! Our kitchen had a large set of pans, dishes, glasses, electric can opener, blender, etc. The microwave doubled as an oven, for real baking. The bathrooms had hair dryers, and we had an iron, ironing board, vacuum cleaner, etc. There was a trash chute at the end of our outdoor hallway, and whenever we needed new bath/kitchen towels, we set our hamper of dirty ones just outside our door. There were two elevators, centrally located, but they weren't very speedy. The front desk had some board games and movies to check out, and there was a little area/table in the lobby for children to color with crayons. We have been Bluegreen owners for six years, and have never regretted joining. Resorts like this have really spoiled us. On our way home, we stopped along the Gulf Shore at some timeshare places which are partly owned by Bluegreen, but the beach there wasn't nearly as nice as Florida's, and the staff/facilities weren't even half as nice as the Sea Breeze.

We chose Daytona Seabreeze and could not have had a more wonderful and satisfying stay. Not only were the accomodations fantastic, but the ocean view and beach were superb. We arrived Saturday at about 11 AM and although checkin was not until 4 PM a room was available and we checked in immediately. This used to be the Surfside Inn and it was purchased by BlueGreen Corporation for vacation club rentals. We booked this room through a 2nd party internet site and received a fantastic rate of $104 per night for a King size Suite. The room far exceeded what we expected. Decorated in the 50's-60's motiff, it had 1 King sized bedroom with a full bath, 1 Queen size bedroom, a second full bath, a living room with an L-shaped sleeper sofa, a full kitchen with all amenities and both bedrooms had balconies which overlooked the pool area and ocean. The view was well worth every penny! Starr- the concierge, was so very helpful answering any questions and suggesting dining options. The first night we were there, Starr arranged for us to be picked up and shuttled, free of charge, to \"Views\" Tavern and Grill. This is located on Seabreeze Blvd. in Daytona Beach. The food was excellent- 3 of us chose the special which was baked flounder with sauce and diced tomatoes and came with mouth watering vegetables and carribean potatoes. The other meal chosen was Shrimp Teriyaki and it also was very delicious. The atmosphere was great and the Sangria with real fruit really hit the spot. The 2nd day we dined at a small riverside eatery and had Grouper- you cannot visit Florida without having this. Starr also recommended this place and we liked it because it was casual and quick before we were picked up by the free shuttle to go on the SunCruz Casino Boat. It was a great time, although I came back with a lighter purse. The beach was fantastic! If you want to visit Daytona Beach and want to avoid the crowds, August is the time to go. We would walk out of the elevator, pass the desk, walk by the pool and down the stairs to the beach. We rented beach chairs and umbrellas both days of our stay for a nominal fee- but would not go any other way. Watching the sunrise from the beach or our balcony was a sight to see. The beauty of the ocean is something that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. We even got to see dolphins swimming within 50 ft of the beach. It was a memorable weekend- awesome accomodations, friendly and courteous staff and beauty all around. Thanks to all at the Daytona Seabreeze for making it happen!", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, Ca", "Title": "\u201c5 days at Daytona Surfside\u201d", "Author": "Ishmayel", "ReviewID": "UR2482492", "Content": "My son and I had to stay in Daytona Beach from 7/29-8/3/04 on family business. I chose this place because of oceanfront location, internet access, available kitchen, and exercise room. It was fine, no problems. Our room was on the top floor. Everything was neat, clean, and in working order. The staff were all friendly and helpful, except the night clerk who slept through our 3:30 AM wakeup call. Thank goodness for the alarm clock that worked! And except for a little rust stain on the refrigerator, I have no criticism of the room or facilities. It is not a luxury property, but for an oceanfront location, it is a bargain. The \"beach\" at Daytona Beach, is remarkable for its width, flatness, hardness and cars, often occupied by smokers and drinkers who pitch their butts and cans out the window. Not my idea of a \"beach\" in any sense, except for the fascinating shorebirds and pelicans.

Partner & I came over from England on US timeshare package. Allocated this HOTEL - HELL HOLE. Even American's had same opinion. We were on top floor; the balcony rail was crumbling concrete. Looking along the balconies you could see they were all the same, and you could see where concrete had fallen off the roof. Pigeon droppings festooned the balcony rails and floor, and were never cleaned off. During our stay the pool was never cleaned out. Each morning before it was open, you could see the dirt at the bottom of the pool. The size of the twin room was ok, but we had been given a room for the disabled, so had grip rails around the toilet, and bath. Waiting for the lift, was a nightmare, as the air-conditioning motor blew out constant hot air. It is possible to prevent persons from the next balcony coming over and entering your room, HOW!? Well, you can not lock the sliding doors; you have to \u201cput the bar across\u201d. In NO WAY WOULD THIS HOTEL MEET THE HOTEL STANDARDS SET FOR EUROPEEN destinations.

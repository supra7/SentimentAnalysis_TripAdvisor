I paid ~$95 a night booked through a popular travel website which was on par for several other hotels nearby. The Good: Friendly and helpful staff, clean room, comfortable bed, good room cleaning and service during the day while I was out, plenty of hot water and standard hotel amenities, lap pool and hot tub were nice and not crowded with kids. The Bad: Wireless connectivity sucked all three days (slow, dropped connections, flaky DNS). If you need to get serious work done that requires high-speed internet, I'd stay somewhere else. No free breakfast (they wanted $10.95 for cafe style breakfast), dirty hallways, bad layout (you had to go outside through the courtyard to get to the elevators or walk all the way around the side of the hotel - in November), and don't expect any privacy in the business center, which is literally inside the concierge/grocery store/coffee area. The hotel was also difficult to find if you're not from the Indy area and familiar with some of the side streets.

I feel sorry for the staff who are really friendly and doing their best with a hotel that's obviously suffering in this economy.

Our group of ladies from Alpha Zeta Beta sorority had a fabulous time at your hotel. Even though we were a small group, your property made us feel as if your entire staff was dedicated to only us, contrary to the fact that there were other guests staying in the hotel. Stephanie at the front desk was friendly and accommodating with every request I made from her. House cleaning staff cleaned and then came back around most afternoons to make sure everything was ok and did we need anything. Ramon was efficient and friendly whenever he was serving us in banquets or the dining room. He made sure we knew if we needed anything to just ask. Kyle the bartender is a gem. I say this as I have 20 years experience in the restaurant business and he knows the meaning of guest service. He made us feel like we were walking into his house each day when we entered his bar. Zac the manager was a man of many hats during our stay, he was visible and available all day. I often found myself wondering if he slept at all during our event as I saw him first thing in the morning and last thing at night. He even went above and beyond by driving one of our ladies to the local Mejjer store to pick up a few things when no one else was available. Finally, Derek the chief engineer of the property did double duty as our van driver and took us wherever we wanted to go and happily picked us up when we were ready. It was so refreshing to see a group of individuals work so well together and wear so many different hats. They all did whatever job was at hand and needed tending to, and with a smile on their face to boot. You should be very proud of them as they exemplify the true meaning of guest service. Please extend my deepest appreciation to all of them for making our 86th National Convention a roaring success! I hope to have the opportunity to stay at your property again in the future as I know it is a place where I can feel at home.

Lateia at the front desk, Kyle and Kevin in the bar and Zack of the managerial staff were all phenomenal and extremley helpful. I would say that the hotel might even be short staff in some areas like the cafe' wait staff or banquet services in that one or two people are constantly working in the areas and are obviously doing the work of two to three people. This was very obvious on Saturday morning with the arrival of another small group and weekend travelers. We watched as one woman was expected to bring drinks, bus tables and cash out patrons for more than 40 people. She was a tropper, and was taking on the challange with grace, but several of us were half way through our meals before she was able to take our drink order. Some guests might have been less understanding and taken that out on her which would have been unfortuante and not her fault. Also, I have to comment on the food service for the banquets. Our group conducts this event annually in many hotels across the country and almost every person in attendance was impressed by the quality of the banquet meals. Every single meal was very good. As for the facilities. The hotel rooms were nice and comfortable but I was a bit shocked that the rooms are still furnished with tube TV's instead of LCD or plasma considering that the lobby and business areas seem to be updated with some of the most recent technology. The rest of the hotel was clean, comfortable, and cozy even with the damage from the recent fire. I didn't get to utilize the lap pool or fitness equipment but I heard from others in our group that they were clean and updated. I do think that the hotel with it's distracting location next to the interstate might attract more businees by putting in a standard size outdoor pool. As we expected, that was the one complaint of those in our group.

I had the opportunity yesterday and was very disappointed. This was *not* booked on the cheap, due to the last minute nature of the trip, I paid almost a rack rate via SPG.com The good - my check in at 2am (late flights) was friendly and considerate. The lady on reception explained that due to some recent fire damage, the property was not in top shape, but the stay would be warm and welcoming. So far so good. The bad - The rooms at rear of the property are about 75' from the freeway, there are tractor trailers rumbling by all night. The Iron did not work properly, there was a nice big black unidentified hair to greet me on the bathroom seat and there were no extra pillows in the room. Okay, put in earplugs, have creased clothes and wipe of the toilet seat with a wet wipe, not the end of the world, but disappointing nevertheless for a 'premium' hotel. The unacceptable - As it was approaching 3am I decided to book breakfast in the room, as I had an early start. Filled in the form, stated a time and hung it on my door. I woke up about an hour later as the door handle was rattled by somebody picking it up (seriously!) Next morning, surprise surprise, no sign of breakfast. Called the restraunt, no reply and time was running short so I had to go. While waiting for the elevator, coming up, I was treated to two of the houskeeping staff, f-ing and blinding to each other as the elevator approached. I was then treated by the 'thousand yard stare' as I attempted to get myself and my bag onboard. Not nice. I got to the desk and enquired about my missing breakfast and more importantly whether I had been charged for something I did not receive. The young lady behind the desk went immediately into 'attitude' mode and told me straight away that I hadn't put my room number on the form. Probably true, but you see as I explained, I filled it out at 3am after 12 hours of travel and I may have overlooked that. Wait, wasn't it collected off my door? Her response was it was not her problem nor the staffs responsibility to check if the room number is on the order as IT COMES OFF THE DOOR!!!!! By her immediate response, I'm guessing this happens a lot (I for one missed where the number goes), but rather than spend two nanoseconds checking on the form it's much easier not to make the effort. How many breakfast orders can there be? 20? 30? 10? It's not hard. I was really offended by the whole head swaying 'talk to the hand' attitude. I would have been so easy to fix this - 1.) Sorry about that sir 2.) Next time you'll notice theres a room number space on the form 3.) Do you have time to eat in the dining room? 4.) If not, how about a cup of joe and a danish to go? I asked to speak to the duty manager and she said 'fill in a feedback form' or the dining room is over there if you want to speak to the manager.

After waiting an extended period of time to start the check in process (with no one else in line mind you), she receives a phone call midway through the process the conversation of which was trivial. If this hotel wasn't as convenient to where I wanted to be I would have left. There were issues with the wireless connection as well... can't say that is a hotel issue, however there is a lot of confusion that frustrated other conversations further based on the hotel name.... raddison vs. sheraton.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable, clean, but loud expressway noise in south facing rooms\u201d", "Author": "MaireadWisconsin", "ReviewID": "UR57577777", "Content": "We stayed two nights, there was a large convention of builders, check-in clerk kindly put us away from the group and said to call if anyone was loud. Very nice service, new carpet, sofa, bedding. The biggest drawback was the extremely loud noise from the expressway (TV small and old but I don't care about that with free internet available here). This hotel was built maybe 13 years ago as a Wyndham. The negative reviews on Tripadvisor scared me, but I was very happy (if I had remembered the expressway noise warning I would have asked for another room, but I travel with a fan to cancel out noise and it worked in this case). I had an excellent rate from Priceline, I may not have been happy to pay the regular rate.

It does not seem like good business to not inform a caller that his reservation is made as if online. If that was what I wanted I would have made it myself.

This hotel was alright. Nothing fancy. Quiet. Tiny fitness room. Tube TV's from the 90's. Overpriced food. Most of all it's all by itself. Make sure you have a car if you go here. There is NOTHING in walking distance. My review is for their incredible lack of customer service. I called the GM to solve an incorrect charge to my account ($650!! worth of incorrect charges) and he didn't bother to get back to me. To be fair he did call at 745 AM on a Saturday, 2 days after 2 calls and corporate complaints. The supervisor agreed it was their fault but could not change it until I solve their problem myself. Corporate customer service has been no better. They charged my account 4 days after my departure, without notifying me.

Overall, I can't compain. Had a clean room, clean bed, and clean bathroom. But everything seemed slightly off. It's out of the way in a corporate area. However if you check-in after 11pm you have to use the buzzer to get in as if you were checking into a hotel in the ghetto. The hotel is doughnut shaped. The check-in is on one side and you have to walk all the way around to the other to go up the elevator. It was 30 degrees outside and the AC was on high in our hallway. Fortunatly the temprature was fine in the room. I can't really complain about the place, but there were things that just didn't feel right and were quite distracting.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAvoid\u201d", "Author": "Sgoes", "ReviewID": "UR2445109", "Content": "After looking through the AAA book (3 stars) and trusting the Sheraton name, I booked this hotel through a web site.

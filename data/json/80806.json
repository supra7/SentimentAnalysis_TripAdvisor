{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fine, close to attractions, but needs some TLC We stayed at this hotel for one night. My friend and i were headed to a conference and we decided to get there a day early so we wanted central accommodations. This place was good for $59.00. It is about 2-3 blocks from Union square to the east of Union Square. There is a Starbucks two doors down to the left and a Jack in the Box two doors to the right, a theater in front of the hotel and some great Chinese restaurants next door, along wth Colibr\u94c6 Restaurant also next door, but it seemed a bit to pricey for Mexican food.The hotel is tiny, but everything works well. We checked in quickly and they were nice. When we got off of the elevator, there was a smell of the Chinese place next door, but our room didn't smell. The bathroom had a faint smell of having been cleaned with a dirty washcloth (that was the best description we could find for the smell), but it was clean. Truthfully, the hotel rooms need a good painting, but we did NOT experience any bugs. I'm big on checking the mattresses for bed bugs, etc, but there were thankfully NO issues.The only thing that I disliked was the ceiling which needs repair. When I was working on the desk in the corner of the room, a tiny piece of drywall fell on my head. No biggie, but there is water damage.Overall, if you're going to San Francisco to see the sites and want something cheap in the center of town, this is a great option. My friend and I agreed that we would stay there again if we didn't care about any luxury. Closest BART/station was on Powell about four blocks away.By the way, the next night we moved to the MArriott on 4th and Market, and paid a reduced rate (which was truly a bargain for SF accommodations) of $130, so, in comparison, the Union Square is a bargain for the place.Finally, because this is downtown SF, you WILL see many beggars on the street. Just keep your distance, don't be rude, and they'll leave you alone.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR953781087", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shell_217"}, {"Content": "Great location but the rest is not great If you're in a town like San Francisco you are out all day and you just need a central room to spend the night.

I am used to staying in budget accommodation - especially on a weak dollar - but this was pretty ordinary even by those standards. Room was clean and the blokes on the front desk for the early morning shift and the night shift were pretty friendly and helpful. That is about the best that can be said. The day shift front desk bloke was unhelpful. Seemed more interested in his iPod than attending to guests. Room was incredibly noisy - so much so that I had to brave the San Francisco beggars and run up to the pharmacy at midnight to buy earplugs. The room had no remote for the TV and no alarm clock. The hot water was temperamental at best and there is no air conditioning. There is no room directory, the phones have no little sticker on them to assist you with dialing out or room-to-room, so I had to run down to a pay phone on occasions. Needs more than a lick of paint and the elevator is so slow that it's quicker to take the stairs! Dodgy locks on doors. Will take considerable work to get it up to acceptable - even complimentary ear plugs for the rooms facing Geary Street would be a start!

A couple of cockroaches paid a visit to us in the shower in the morning and rather let the side down, though they did appear quite friendly. Car parking is at an underground and rather dodgy garage a few blocks away - the hotel said the rate was $20 overnight but strangely we were charged $25 and they expected a tip (in vain!).You think the car is being parked there, but in fact it is driven to a lot elsewhere in town, as we caught them out. Central location for hotel but rundown area rife with assertive beggars - my wife waiting with our luggage outside the hotel was hassled/propositioned 5 times in the 15 minutes it took to retrieve the car from the garage, and had to take refuge back inside.

I went nuts reading mixed reviews on hotels and safe/unsafe areas until I was forced to book something immediately for there were only a few hotels left with rooms available - I booked a room at USPH because it is very near Union Square, because they were cheep and they offered not more or less than what we needed in a room ( two beds and a private bathroom - we were visiting the city, not the hotel room) and because they were the only people that didn't try to make me book another room for myself or pay extra for a third person in a 2bed room (odd number travel groups are discriminated big time :-)LOCATION:The hotel is on a perfect location (for tourists that care about, both, shopping and site seeing). If you go just a block farther away from Union Square, you are getting too close to Tenderloin area which I wouldn't call dangerous but not a pleasant area to have to walk through either, especially with kids or elderly people.Union Square is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel and that's where all the stores are (and the entrance to China Town). There are bunch of breakfast places around and you'll be on a perfect start point to walk to the places you should definitely walk to/through/around or take a ride to the places you\u9225\u6a92l have to take a ride to anyway.If you don't care about shopping, still try to find a place east of Van Ness (even Hyde) and north of Geary, excluding Tenderloin - the Union Square area is very shopppingtouristy but other areas are too residential to me. If you really hate touristy avoid Fisherman's Wharf like plague. And one more thing about locations: I don't think you should avoid hotels on Market Street if you find a good deal - that street seems to be dividing fancy from sketchy, but it is still half-fancy and steps away from completely fancy.HOTEL:The hotel itself is ridiculously worn out. Yet, the room was surprisingly decent: it didn't smell like a garden in bloom, the windows have never-ever been cleaned, but the bathroom was clean and I didn't see any insects or stains on sheets and towels (honestly, I didn't search for them either, but I didn't see any). To cut the long story short, I was not afraid I was going to get a disease from a little dust on the joinery. The rooms have no AC (July/August???). It is also very noisy (it is down town), but we were so tired from walking that it didn't bother us at all.The hotel stuff is rather strange - they were not unpleasant but they are not professionals either, kind of like locals that you ask for direction on the street, very casual :-)If you organize months in advance (unlike me) you could find a cute bb or a nicer hotel for the same or a little more money and in a nice city area. If no, this hotel should do fine.In conclusion, my clueless fellow travelers - BOOK WAY IN ADVANCE, STICK TO THE UNION SQUARE AREA IF POSSIBLE (even if you are an anti-touristy adventurer), don't be afraid of this hotel and ENJOY SAN FRANCISCO!!!", "Date": "Jun 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR823561299", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RubyRemorker"}, {"Content": "Very convenient, friendly staff, basic amenities I stayed at the hotel whil attending a conference.

TVs could be heard blaring throughout the night. The walls are paper thin. Creepy to see some worn-down looking people roaming the halls that might have lived there? A few of them looked homeless. We loved San Fran- but this place was more like a hostel. The only good thing was consistent hot water in a new bathroom. And don't get me wrong- this place COULD be charming in the European sense. But it is NOT, by any means. Sad and seedy was how I felt about it during my stay. It totally lacks charm and warmth. It could be cool if they redid the awful rugs, updated the lighting, replaced the delapitated, broken furniture, cleaned the haphazard stains everywhere, and fixed the peeling paint. AND- I thought the guys at the front desk were very ODD, I don't know why anyone is raving about them. I've stayed in some very low budget b  b's, hotels, and hostels all over Europe and am not a snob when it comes to hotels - and this WAS a great price for that area. That being said, this place was one of the worst places I've ever stayed in. I will never stay at the Union Square Plaza again...Pay a little more if you can and stay somewhere decent.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR729103168", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Facci"}, {"Content": "Great Value Good Location-just a few minuites walk form the BART Powell St. station, easily accessable from the airport.Large room- at first i thought rooms are small because of the price, but actually much larger than expected.Friendly staff- I have stayed at many economy class hotels,and some people are really rude.

Well the saying is certainly true you get what you pay for and we absolutely found that to be true at the Union Square Plaza Hotel at $79 dollars a night in this very sought after very expensive SF district. I knew it wasn't a boutique hotel or anything close to that but I thought it would be crust free. We (my hubby and I) were in SF for 4 nights, had reservations to stay 3 at the USPH, we decided to stay an extra night but at a different hotel the last night , couldn't take the grim anymore. It's such a shame too cause the front desk staff and location is so wonderful. But if you want an overall more pleasant experience you'll search for a little nicer hotel in this area. I know I know I said the same thing We won't be spending very much time in our room, there's so much to do in San Fran and we can save money for other things if we get a cheaper room. But you do want a clean room right? Shabby but clean would be just fine right? I'm just going to say it, this was the dirtiest hotel i've ever stayed in and i'm no snob i'm not snooty,fussy or a high maintainance traveler and I'm certainly no neat freak at all ( for me to complain you know it was pretty bad hahhahahahah!) but our room was covered in filth and crust. from the floor to ceiling on the walls and counters. ewwwwwww! I am young and I don't mind staying at 1 to 2 star hotels. I mean that's usually how we travel. but my gosh this place forgot to do it's spring/autumn/winter/summer cleaning. It was hot. So hot we had to go buy a small fan from Walgreens. I asked for a fan but they said we have already given out all of our fans, we even had to go buy a few more. Well la dee da for the guests that beat us to it, but it didn't change the fact that we were sweltering. Yes sweltering in San Fran. I have proof!! and they have no fans or air conditionion in their darn rooms and we had a street front room I pity the folks who had an alley room.....Ewwww I have to say it again their rooms were dank nasty!!! Shabby we can handle, rundown and just old looking we can take, but grimmy and dirty and hot was too much to bare. 30 minutes with a sponge and some windex, bleach and a fan is what that room needed and I would have been fine. We still had an awesome, wicked, rip roaring time in SF, SF is a wonderful city. It was so filthy it was comical to us after a while( sounds kinda gross but we didn't wanna hassle with cancel fees and finding a new place and packing our stuff up so we just dealt with it). So do yourself a favor and stay at a nicer hotel. not a foofy expensive one but at least a clean one. Well I must say again the front desk staff was very helpful and kind, so kind I almost feel bad writing a bad review., but not bad enough cause their cleaning crew needs to be replaced or payed more to do a better job or something. So whether or not you choose to heed my warning or not, travel safe and don't let the dust mites bite.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR907660646", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "StarZip"}, {"Content": "Great value for the money, excellent location I have stayed twice at this place in the last 2 years now, and have been very very satisfied.

We did not take pictures as we did not want to be reminded of how awful the hotel was we tried to spend as much time away as possible.I would not recommend this hotel for couples with children i dont feel its safe to walk around in the area the hotel is in at night there are alot of tramps and they really do bother you and it can be quite scary.The only advantages of this hotel is that it is in a decent location (if you want to be right next to union sq) and is very cheap. If you are doing alot of sightseeing then being near union sq is not essential as nothing is within walking distance apart from shopping. You still need to use public transport to get around the best form is probably the bus or tram.

However the location is superb; close to all modes of public transport, excellent shopping, many types of eateries and restaurants, and all of the sights and sounds of San Francisco. The room was quite large and the bathroom was also large and very clean. We had four large suitcases with us and we found no trouble storing them and still having plenty of space around the room.This is a very old building and it shows. There is a 'dank' smell throughout, especially in the corridors. Water pressure is non-existent and aesthetically it's not great. However, in my opinion, you get what you pay for. My partner and I stayed four nights at this property and we enjoyed our experiences there. We found the bed (king size) to be very comfortable indeed, and we slept well every night. We were awoken early each morning by sounds of traffic and the general goings on down on street level. But this was not a bad thing for us and we were grateful to get an early start to each day.The staff on the front desk were always friendly, chatty and helpful. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy. The desk was 'manned' by three different gents that we saw throughout our stay. When we were leaving for the airport the man at the desk organized a shuttle for us and gave us a $10.00 discount voucher for the shuttle service, so it only cost $20.00 USD for the two of us (about $4.00 USD more than getting the train, which is how we got from the airport to the hotel when we arrived).All in all I would recommend this hotel to people who are planning full days out and about in San Francisco. We really only spent an hour or two each night in the room before we went to sleep, so for us it was terrific value.The only negatives we found were:-Water pressure is terrible (although I doubt if it could be helped in such a large, old building).-Towels are tiny and only two are provided (a girl needs a separate towel for her hair!!!)-Pillows are small and very thin. I'm sure more could/would have been avaiable had I asked, though.-TV reception is not great.In conclusion we were very happy with the price, location and service at Union Square Plaza Hotel.", "Date": "May 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR644773653", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gkets"}, {"Content": "Great, Convenient and Decent Hotel in SFO This hotel should be choosen by those on a budget but at the same time looking for a good time stay at a prime district located less than 5 min walk from Powell St. Everything from the reception to the day of checking out, it was truly smooth, friendly and pleasant.

Bring your own toiletries, as the only amenity supplied is bar soap. Good coffee is available in the lobby and there are lots of restaurants nearby. The location cannot be beat, just a block from Union Square and the trolley. The neighborhood is noisy, especially the garbage pick up during the wee hours.

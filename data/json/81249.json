I picked it for the good reviews and its proximity to the Wharf, where we enjoy walking at nighttime. It's an easy 6-block walk from the hotel to Ghirardelli Square. Also just up the road (literally) is the top of Lombard Street, the world's windiest road. We stayed in room 38, which is on the 3rd floor directly facing Lombard. There are exterior stairs and an elevator close by. The room was clean enough and had adequate facilities, including a shower/toilet separate from the vanity area; a refrigerator; and a TV. You pay a deposit for room keys and the TV remote. The staff is friendly and always available. When our toilet stopped up they had a guy up to fix it within 5 minutes. They also offer donuts and pastries there at the front desk in the morning, which was nice and unexpected. They have free Wi-fi, not even a password, though it is extremely slow. The fridge makes a loud-ish rattling sound so I unplugged it at night and propped open its door. Also due to its location on Lombard, there is traffic all night long outside and this is fairly noisy. Walls are thin, as expected for a lower-end motel. The morning we checked out, there was no hot water at all, so no showers for us. They said the hot water heater had stopped working for everyone, for some reason. Many places charge for parking but Redwood's is free, and they guarantee you a space; if you come back from somewhere and there are no spaces they say they will take your keys and double-park you in the lot until a space opens up. They are also close to bus lines in case you like using transit to get around. Our stay was okay, and for $110 in that location we felt it was a good deal, outside of the hot water problem.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart", "Title": "\u201cnice\u201d", "Author": "Maya_on_tour", "ReviewID": "UR127060008", "Content": "Free parking, WiFi, nice staff, good location.

One night there were drunk people outside and we could not sleep, they were so loud. But I guess it can happen anywhere. The price is very good.

The Rates where great, also the special rate over NYE, with everything booked we left for San Francisco.

Bed was comfy and everything had its place, towels were on a rack and toilet was clean and inviting. Toilet flusher was broken, but you could flush it manually so we decided to notify the front office in the morning and started out on the adventures of San Francisco. The toilet was fixed when we got back to the room, and everything was now in order. Also the cleaning had been executed and very though. The Redwood Inn is perfect if you want to stay fairly cheap.

Just make it up 3 blocks of Lombard St. (steep) and you have access to the Cable Car for Downtown. Only negative thing to mention is that sound travels well in the rooms, Lombard St. is a busy Street, you can hear that, as well as other neighbors of the Redwood Inn.

This place is a standard motel. But clean and comfortable. Be sure to ask for a room in the back as Lombard st. is very busy, even into the late hrs of the night. Mai at the front desk was just wonderful! She helped us out so much with directions and suggestions. You can take the stairs to the roof and see part of the Golden Gate Bridge. This location is away from Union square and fisherman's wharf, but only a short busride. They have free parking but the parking lot is very tight. Thank goodness we ditched the car the first night back in SF. All rooms are non smoking and they do not allow pets. However,There is a doggie day care down the street. As far as accomodations, the room has a/c, a nice size refrigerator, coffee maker,tv, but no alarm clock. (I found that odd.) Free internet, and HBO. They do not provide toiletries like shampoo or conditoner. That was no biggie to us since we always pack our own anyway. One thing that did irk me is, they never bothered to throw away the tiny sliver of soap that was now half the size (and we all know how BIG those motel soaps are..lol) that we used to wash our hands with by the sink. You would think they would have replaced that. We diddnt have breakfast there so I cant comment on the continental breakfast. I really have no complaints about the motel. It served our needs as a family of four. We diddnt stay in the room much anyway. Would I stay here again? Probably. But first I would like to try some other places in San Francisco. This place is good for families.

We thought staying a night in San Francisco would be exciting. I was looking for a moderately priced hotel that would accomodate four people comfortably. I found the Redwood Inn while searching the internet for a hotel that would meet my needs, and reserved a room based solely on the reviews of other guests. Making the reservation was a challenge because it does not have a website or published e-mail address. There was no way to make my reservation online. Also, there were no pictures of the hotel on the internet. When we arrived in San Francisco, after 6 hours of driving, we found the hotel relatively easily. It's a little tricky with the rules on Lombard street. While the front office staff were friendly and helpful, to the point of offering concierge services for tourists, we were a little dismayed at being charged a $50 deposit and assigned a remote for the tv in our room. The one elevator on the property is small and confusing to operate, but we made our way to our room and washed up before walking several blocks down to Fishermans Wharf. The room was adequate, but nothing special. We had a double queen bed room, with a table & chairs and a small refrigerator. The other amenities of the hotel included free parking and pastries for breakfast. There is also a small observation deck on the roof. Overall the hotel served its purpose, but I think it's seen better days. I definitely would not recommend the room to a family of four.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Jolla", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5425722", "Content": "My traveling companion and I spent $110 per night for 3 nights, and this was for 2 queen beds. I must say, this is the best bargain I've ever had in San Francisco - and I have gone there several times over the past 14 years. First of all, the staff are very friendly and polite. On the first day I got there, I noticed that one of the light bulbs in the bathroom was burned out, so I notified the front desk. Not more than one minute later, one of the maids was knocking on our door to rectify the situation. Now, this is my idea of prompt customer service, if it still exists anywhere! Without asking them, we were given an upper floor room towards the back, away from the traffic noise in the front. I slept very comfortably all 3 nights I was there. The hotel room itself was kept very immaculate by the maids. Also, a great plus for the room was the mini-fridge, as mentioned by the past reviewers. The reason why this is convenient is because some of you may not want to have their free donuts and small muffins for breakfast (this limited choice is their only downside), and may opt instead to buy stuff like yogurt or juice. My friend and I walked to Fisherman's Wharf with no problems. The neighborhood seems nice and quiet, safe enough to walk around at night. If you're game for an uphill walk, you can even make it to the crooked street to take pictures. (I would avoid driving to the crooked street by car in the late afternoon or evenings, because there always seems to be an endless line of cars stretching for blocks). I took the advice of one of the past reviewers and took in the amazing views at the rooftop of the hotel. I was so impressed! Overall, this is quite a gem of a hotel.

The good points: -the location. It was a little off the beaten path so in general was quieter than, say the Union Square area, yet it close to Van Ness Ave. where you can catch a bus to Fisherman's Wharf or to Market St. We actually walked from this hotel to Pier 39 and found it to be a pleasant walk. Also there were no homeless people as there were near hotels in other areas. -the room. It was a good size and the beds were comfortable. It was also very clean, as was the bathroom. -the extras. The room had a mini-fridge, which came in handy when we decided to buy milk and cereal at the gas station food mart down the street. Also, it had A/C. I know people say that it doesn't get hot in SF, but when we were there it was quite sunny. The rooms would get stuffy so we appreciated being able to cool them down with the A/C. -free parking. After spending a few days walking and using MUNI, we spontaneously decided to rent a car to drive over the Golden Gate Bridge and see other areas. It was nice to know that we could park for free at the Inn. -the elevator. Although we had a room at the fourth floor at this exterior hall motor inn, we had no trouble getting our luggage up there because of the elevator. The only negative was the Internet service (which is free). My husband needed to check e-mails and found the connection rather slow. Also, he would lose the connection if we turned on the TV. If you need Internet, we advise you to ask for a room near the front where the wireless connection is better. However, we expect that many vacation travelers would not need the Internet so much, in which case this would be a good hotel choice. (It isn't a business hotel, after all). As I said, overall we were happy with it and would stay here again if ever we needed a downtown SF hotel again. We paid $100 for a one queen-bed room and felt it to be a good value.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cExcellent find!\u201d", "Author": "sdtravelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR5406994", "Content": "Walking around Lombard street we happened upon a great little hotel.

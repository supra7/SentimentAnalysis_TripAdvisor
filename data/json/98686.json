They are always there now, parked in the parking lot every night. I had a couple of days to kill before I moved into my apartment and I had a pleasant stay a year prior. This time, all hell broke loose the two nights I was there. Several drunk dierct tv guys really caused a lot of problems. One kept me up all night screaming at the poor front desk clerk (who was obviously scared to death of this jerk) and punching walls/ breaking beer bottles. Another guy thought he could \"get a massage in my room\" ....because he held the door for me. I spent all night wishing I could go get in the pool and hot tub. Honestly, I didn't leave my room until the morning because I thought any of them could be rapists. They were highly drunk and inappropriate.

The doors are angled towards each other and seem to transmit a lot of noise when being closed. Of course it didn't help that I had someone with possibly a psychological disorder that was leaving and entering his room every 15 minutes during the night. While in his room he would yell profanities and would storm out of his room periodically and let the door slam shut (the doors close very hard). I asked to be given a different room, but the clerk called the man and asked that he calm down. Well he did calm down somewhat but he still kept me up for another 30 minutes.

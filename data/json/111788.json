They don't call this area the Beverly Hills of Hawaii for nothing. The resort is beautifully landscaped, just as you would expect from a resort with the Waldorf Astoria badge. Just bear in mind there are a lot of families at this resort. During the day it seems there are kids everywhere. I would rate this resort higher, but the price of food and drink was so high. I understand this is a top-quality resort, but this was insane. For example, my friend and I stopped at the cafe and bought a bottle of Dasani water and a bottle of Mountain Dew: $12. A bag of Sun Chips: $8. At the bars it's $14.50 for a cocktail. Also, at the time, the reusable plastic tiki cup seemed like a good value when the bartender explained it. Don't bother. It's $22 for your first drink in a tiki cup, and the rest are $14.50. There's no discount, but the bartender will make it sound that way. Don't fall for it. Fortunately there's a mall within a 5 minute walk of the resort grounds, which has a handful of eateries. I recommend Cheeseburger Island Style (it's not a Cheesburger in Paradise, which we originally thought). I was hoping to get in a few good runs during this trip since I'm training for a marathon, but the sidewalk network in the neighborhood is incomplete. There is a nice path that follows the shoreline for about 3 miles.

We extended our stay after the rewards trip at the Marriott next door to the Grand Wailea. (see review) Overall the Grand Wailea was amazingly beautiful. We read some negative reviews on this hotel and overall it was a 4-star hotel. We were with an all-expense paid business group so it was all amazing - however if we were paying ourselves - the drinks ($15+) and food were expensive. The food was really great for buffet food - we had a luau and the food was really very impressive (I have been involved with the James Beard foundation, and highly involved in the gourmet food industry for many years) - great quality Ahi, and top notch tempura and sushi. All of the cooked food was close to perfect. Great morning breakfast buffet \u2013 we ate at the buffet everyday b/c it was included as part of the group \u2013 but expensive (I think $26pp) but worth it if you are a breakfast person. I've been to about 12 Luau dinners and I think this was the best one ever. Due to the weather our luau was indoors, but the fire show was outside; and all in all it was an amazing show with very talented performers. The pools are ethereal \u2013 and extensive. There are rope swings, slides, winding rivers, a grotto bar and multiple hot tubs. We did not have an opportunity to use all of the water features. There is even a water elevator \u2013 (the original owner\u2019s son was paralyzed from the waist down and he wanted his son to have access to the slides, so he built a water elevator.) We never sat at the adult only pool. There are plenty of chairs and the staff is pretty good about not letting people put their things on a chair for several hours to reserve it while they are on a whale watch. It seemed like most people complied with this rule; and finding chairs was not a big issue. There are many cabanas that you have to rent. We did not rent one personally, but our company rented the big one by the main pool. The slides close at 4 or 5pm (I forget) but it did seem a bit early as the kids still wanted to use the water features. Specific helpful details on this hotel: * They make you pay for the cabanas \u2013 I think the umbrellas on the beach are free. * Many people put towels on chairs early in the morning to \"reserve: them for use later in the day. The hotel has a 1 hour reserve limit and they seem to be good about that, so no one can reserve a chair in the morning a leave for a boat excursion for several hours - it seems to work very well -we always followed the rules and were able to find a chair when needed. Some of the chairs are broken; so be careful as I sat on a chair a fell through it. This is not what you would expect at this type of upscale resort, but I noticed several chairs with lose fittings after I fell through. *There is a zero entry sand pool for handicap accessability along with chairs for water entry in each pool area. *They have complimentary water stations with fresh cold water through-out the pool areas \u2013 very nice when you need a quick cold drink of water. * If you are looking for a \u201cW\u201d type of contemporary hotel this is not for you. It is basically a family upscale resort, with a great pools and slides for kids \u2013 with pool side restaurants and a grotto bar for adults who want to play and have a great tropical drink at the same time. This hotel has and elegant, detailed European ambiance; rather than a chic, minimalist feel. *There were many life guards and the pools were well attended. *The rooms were a bit dated, but very comfortable beds and elegant bathrooms that were perfect \u2013 this is not a chic hotel, so no dark wood shutters opening to the bed area. More ornate than chic. In summary this is a beautiful upscale resort \u2013 perfect for families, corporate events, and weddings. The grounds are amazing and this is likely one of the most beautiful places to have a wedding (with the chapel on the grounds). Great food \u2013 probably the best buffet style food I\u2019ve ever had. However, it may not be the perfect hotel for a romantic honeymoon; (have the wedding there). A great place to go back once the honeymoon is over and you have kids. We felt guilty that our kids were not with us.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Beautiful!\u201d", "Author": "Roxiematilda", "ReviewID": "UR126325187", "Content": "We recently visited Maui and had the pleasure of staying at the Grand Wailea. The entire place is incredible. Every where you look there is something to see. The pools and all of the grounds were filled with lush, tropical foliage. It was a feast for the eyes! We really could not stop taking pictures. The beach was gorgeous as well. Our room was great. Bed was super comfy. Soft fluffy towels were always plentiful. The food was pretty good as well. Had the sushi several times and was always super. We did have dinner at Humu one night and while that was very good, I thought the food could have been a tiny bit better. The ambiance and service were spectacular, so I would still recommend it. The only little complaint that i had was that it seemed no matter how early you got to the pool (7 AM) there were still no lounge chairs available, they all had towels claiming them. Same on the beach. The hotel does have a strict use them or use them policy and we did see them \"unclaim\" chairs. You just have to ask, and they will help you find a spot. Used the Spa, and that truly is world class as well. For those that just want some coffee in the morning, next door in the Shopping Plaza is a Honolulu Coffee Co. Coffee is great, and reasonably priced. There is also a convenience store where you can purchase beer, wine, liquor, snacks, sunblock - again reasonably priced. At GW, things are expensive.

We stayed a week. My wife and I read many reviews here before the trip, just to get some ideas on how we might make our experience more enjoyable, and what to watch out for ....if there are issues, better to know about it ahead of time. We had some concerns having read a few very negative reports, but we had a great time,and we were very impressed by the whole operation. Let me start by saying that everyone we met in Maui was very friendly...not just the Grand staff, but everyone. It was remarked upon by us at different times. People were just as helpful and nice as could be. I stopped to get instructions at a hardware store..it was on the Kula highway. The guy was not only super nice but knew exactly where we were going and had a little map he gave me that took us right to the spot. The first thing that you do when you get to the hotel is let the valet team take care of your car. The valet system worked great! Then step into the lobby of the Grand...if you could call it a lobby...it was awesome! It made me smile being there. We have done some traveling and stayed at some nice hotels, but this was beautiful. Nothing kitschy like you would see in Vegas. Even my daughter was impressed....she said WOW. That says it all. The only ding was that we were early and the check-in time is 4, so we had to wait for a couple hours. But waiting in the open lobby area was pleasant. Next time we will have a change of clothes at hand and go walk on the beach or swim. They took our cell number and called. I had to go to the conference while my wife dealt with getting the baggage moved to the room. It was no problem, and she texted me that the room was 'lovely'. We were on the chapel garden, and had a beautiful garden and ocean view. The room was very clean and the maid service was excellent...no chocolate on your pillow at turn down, but fresh towels every evening were nice. The grounds and the beach were gorgeous! The weather was a little windy, but otherwise perfect....it is a dry area, so they don't get bothered by much rain. We did eat at the hotel on a few occasions. The pineapple upside down cake is not as good as at Roy's in Waikiki, but we found Roy's to have been our lucky find of the trip for food...the best. We tried to have dessert at Humahuma one evening, but made the mistake of telling them we only wanted dessert before we were seated, and then they didn't have any available seating, which we could see was not true. So we went to the Bistro and had dessert there. We did the Luau one evening and really liked it. The food was good, and the show was enjoyable and not too long. Plan ahead and buy your ticket through Costco...I understand you can save about $25 per person that way. Get there at 4 for the seat assignments, and you will have a much better table. We were toward the front in the middle. I could go on, but more would start to become tedious, and you will want to find out some things for yourself. We loved it at the Grand Wailea!

Its a huge resort (we like that ... others might not) with the most amazing pools. We loved the pools that all join up by water slides ... was lots of fun for adults and kids! The grounds are beautiful and are well maintained. The whole place is great, kept very clean, the rooms were great with a huge bathroom. We stayed in an ocean view room (3rd floor) which had beautiful views over the pools and the ocean as well. The food options were very limited unfortunately. We had buffet breakfast included which was good (but i've had better). When it came to lunch, there were a couple of options, but we felt dinner was a bit of a let down. There were only two restaurants open for dinner. Menu's are not extensive so after eating there a couple of nights, we didn't want to keep eating the same foods. It would be great if they had a change in menu every night, would have kept us coming back. If you hire a car - you can drive to other nearby places with a LOT more options for dining. One thing that really put a damper on our vacation is the service at the front desk. We had prepaid for 1/3 of our accommodation months in advance, however when checking in the hotel put a hold on our credit card for the full amount of the accommodation - which meant that we were unable to use our credit card for the rest of the entire holiday! Tried to understand why they would do that when they already received that money - but front desk couldn't explain anything to me. I've stayed at many resorts in the past and have never had them do this. I pay for the accommodation in advance so I wouldn't need to worry about having the money for it while staying there - backfired in the end. I'm home now, after checking out of the hotel a week ago - and they still haven't released the money on the credit card.

Of course, we had heard that Grand Wailea is the place to stay which is why we booked this hotel, but we did not know all of the little things this hotel had to offer that will keep us coming back here over any other hotel on the island. The grounds are truly beautiful! I was apprehensive about staying at such a large hotel at first, but it is so easy to navigate around the property and all of the different pools and slides all connect to one another. The grotto bar (in the water) is our favorite!The beach is not only beautiful on this side of the island but literally a few steps away from the pool, so it is super convient to go back and forth. They have this program at the hotel where we rented unlimited access to kayaks, paddle boarding, snorkeling gear, etc. for four days and it was totally worth the money; especially compared to the cost to purchase these types of activities outside the hotel. We also took advantage of the beautiful spa and fitness center which I only have good things to say. All of the staff were very professional and friendly from the bellmen to the maid service. After our bed was turned down at night, they would turn on the radio so you had music playing when you came in. We even didn't mind the mandatory daily valet parking, bc we could just call for our car when we knew we were leaving and it would be at the front when you arrive along with any directions you need. When we compared that to the time it would take to get to your car if you self parked, we felt like it was worth it. We got breakfast buffet included when we booked our package which was really useful, so you should check into the current promotion when you are booking your reservation. Next time we return, we will be excited to try the new restuaurant with chef, Alan Wong. I think it is opening in April and sounds great. Again, wonderful experience!

The facility is very large and a little flashy, but our room was lovely and overlooked the ocean. Maid service was excellent and towels were changed twice a day. We did not see hoards of people milling about inside of the hotel - no lines at reception or crowds of people in the lobby or bar areas. There was an entire bank of concierge desks to help you. We never had to wait for an elevator. We called ahead for our car, so it arrived usually when we did. We did not see lines of people in the front of the hotel waiting for cars or taxis. They are very efficient in that respect. The hotel itself is quite peaceful inside. However, once you get outside to the pool and beach areas, all of that changes. It becomes another world. The beach is overcrowded, with people sitting practically on top of each other. You really must get out there by 8 or 9 am to insure that you secure chairs on the beach, and after the attendants set you up, the service ends. No one comes around to take a drink order. Also, unless you pay $94 a day for a cushioned lounge chair with a canopy, there is little shade at the pool. There are several places to have lunch outside, but the food is like airline food and you are served unceremoniously on paper plates. One presumably comes to Hawaii for the sun and beaches and not to stay inside, but I found it much more pleasant to sit on my room balcony and look out over the ocean instead of being herded below. The inside of the hotel is quiet like a spa, and the pool and beach areas are like Macy's at Christmas.

Overall the hotel is nice. The grounds are beautiful. The pool area is awesome. My only complaint is that they are not very accommodating. Considering how much we paid a night to stay here and it is a Waldorf Astoria hotel, I figured the service would be better. The security took my wedding photographer and put her in a security room for about an hour. She has shot photos at this resort many times and has never had a problem. They told her I would have to pay $500 for her to take any pictures of me on property. She had to sign a form stating she would be fined if she took any photos. This is ridiculous. I am a guest of the resort. Since she was held up with them for a hour, that was a hour of getting ready photos I did not get. Then after my Trash the Dress shoot I asked the concierge if they could clean my dress and ship it home for me. He told me they don't clean wedding dresses and could direct me to where I could get a box to ship it myself. Normally I don't rely on hotels to do things for me but this was wedding related so thought they would offer these services. Especially since they have a million weddings here. The pool was overly crowded. They have a sign that says they will remove your belongings from the pool chairs if you have been gone for longer than an hour. I'm not sure they were keeping track of this since we could not find a single pool chair that didn't have a towel on it. We ended up in a grass area away from the pools.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let its singular name fool you, though, the Activity Pool is actually nine pools, seven waterslides (two of them are both long and fast for the thrill-seekers in your family), a white-water rapids slide (a short, wide, fast ride), a spectacular array of man-made caves and grottos (one nearly hiding a large hot tub and one housing a swim-up bar), tropical landscaping and a water elevator. Before my visit, I read about the Grand Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water elevator and was very interested to see it in action. It seems it is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and, in my opinion, a brilliant way to turn the process of collecting water to supply the waterslides into an attraction. At the lowest water level, a water-proof door allows guests access to a circular water silo cleverly disguised in rock. Riders can climb up onto a giant inflatable tube and be lifted up as the water level rises. Onlookers can watch their progress through windows placed every so often up the rock. At the top, guests can hop out and ride down the waterslides. Other fun water attractions here are the adults-only pool, the Tarzan rope swing, the lazy river and the baby beach. The layout and variation of water rides enables families with children (and young-at-heart parents) to all have an equally good time. The rope swing is extremely popular with the 8- to 13-year-old crowd, but I saw a few dads try it out as well. The lazy river is less lazy than any I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve personally tried; the current is delightfully strong and will carry an adult around the pools easily, even with a child in tow. The baby beach is another exceptional idea. This man-made mini beach has sand without the pesky waves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect for babies to sit and splash in while their parents look on. During both days I played at Grand Wailea, I saw both kids and adults (even grandmas and grandpas) thoroughly enjoy the waterslides, elevator, lazy river and all that this wonderful pool has to offer. The Wailea Canyon Activity Pool is a fantastic family vacation find. THE HOTEL Beyond the pool, the hotel and spa are beautifully designed. Tiles and stucco finishes are just beginning to show their age, but the overall tropical ambiance is still intact. Rooms at the Grand Wailea are decorated in a Hawaiian plantation style using pale greens, yellows and blues. Shutters are used instead of drapes at the large front sliding door to the lanai. From my comforts of home checklist, the robes are cozy, rooms have clothes hampers (amazing), and the bathroom has double sinks. Coffee is available in the bathroom (unusual), but much better coffee can be had in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee shop (at a price). Several shops here do a great job of providing for last-minute retail needs and wants.

The bar in the centre of the resort (near the front desk) does some fantastic drinks - easily the best Mai Tais we had in Hawaii and the coconut chill martini was absolutely gorgeous! Kudos to the barman too! The Volcano Bar near the pools was ok - the kid's lunches were awesome and come with a little pail & shovel - very cute! We got a couple of tiki drinks - you pay USD$22 for the drink container and they are very flimsy plastic - the pineapple container didn't last a day. Which isn't that much of a drama but it seems a bit of a rip-off when you are paying $22 for it. Spa Grande was good if not a little awkward. Maybe I'm a prude... but I've never done communal baths where people are wandering around naked. When I've done mineral baths previously I've always been in a room by myself. Although the mineral baths are excellent! And the roman showers - almost as good as the massage I got! Marilyn was a fabulous masseur - I highly recommend her. I enjoyed our experience at the Grand Wailea and I'm happy we got to go.

Very much enjoyed the focus on artwork. Service and staff effort was first rate - except for my concierge experience I'll note later. Until the new restaurant opens, the resort only has 2 full service restaurants and both are oriented for ocean views. Its impossible to get a reservation for either resort restaurant from open to 8pm every day without advanced reservations as they are fully booked with sunset viewers. Both restaurants are good and my dinner at Humuhumu was a highlight of the trip. I'll note that this was my first trip to Maui - a place that was recommended by friends as THE island to experience a slower pace and quiet relaxation. My rooms lanai was great. I watched the sunset from there every night and I loved it. But the resort itself is busy - with alot of families with children, business conferences, etc. I saw the amenities before I arrived so I cant say this was unknown but I hoped for more in the way of adult quiet. My experience with the concierge service was much poorer than the Waldorf Astoria name would imply. I visited twice. Once inquiring how to order and ship fruit and flowers to the mainland. The other was to book a restaurant reservation for my birthday - which at that point I saw as a necessity as, previously noted, restaurant reservations in the Wailea area are tough. For the fruit and flowers inquiry I was handed a brochure that I could use to order from a local company. As much as I tried, I was looking for the concierge to understand I wanted them to arrange the order to my home address. Instead I walked away with a brochure. For my birthday dinner, since the Grand Wailea concierge doesnt appear to have access to preferred tables at their own resort - I was sent offsite to the Four Seasons. My dinner at Duo was very good - and that time at the Four Seasons resort next door showed me that it was likely the place I would visit next as it was more adult oriented and was more responsive to service requests. The Duo staff presented me with a birthday desert. The Grand Wailea, after telling the concierge I was there for my birthday, didnt present me with any greeting at all. I wasnt in Maui expecting birthday freebies but something, anything would have been nice. As many have posted, the additional costs ie parking and resort fees seem unnecessary. Include it in the room rate and be done with it. I'm a Hilton Diamond member and the lack of Diamond amenities was disappointing. The rooms are showing signs of wear, ie dented walls, chipped bathroom tiles - but these are small details. The room itself was very fine.

The pools close at 10pm so there is no problem iwth noise and the slides close at 5pm, so pretty much after that the pools are really quiet. Loved the grounds, the luau was very nice, but expensive. The spa (according to my wife) was great. Concierge and Rose (one of the greeters) were extremely helpful and friendly. If you can, take a trip to the Maui tropical plantation and go zip lining!!! The family loved it, including my 9 year old daughter. Say hi to Alex, Jerimiah and \"Sasquatch\" (that's what they called him, I can't remember his actual name) for me. They were great and they put my daughter at ease. The prices in the Grand Wailea gift stores were comparable to the shops in Lahaina, so you can do some of your shopping there. But definitely take a trip to Safeway and buy your snacks and drinks. You'll save a ton of money instead of $14 drinks at the pool. And the hotel provides an empty fridge to put stuff in - no forced mini bar junk. As my title suggests, the hotel is pricey.

We loved it so much that we joined the member program. Just finished a trip there this week and must say we were disappointed. Here goes: 1) We stayed in Napua tower which we have done several times over the years. Our room, which was attached to a suite, was mismatched in decorations and paint, very tired looking, chipped furniture (bedside table missing a handle), mattresses were horrible. One mattress was so broken down there was a giant valley in the middle of it. Rooms just look and feel like they have been neglected. Cleaning staff did nice job of keeping room clean. Napua tower no longer a value. Breakfast very limited in selection with plated fruit (apparently so you don't take too much), and the appetizer selection in the evening also plated cheese and one, maybe two hot appetizers. Definitely not worth the extra room rate to stay there. On a positive, staff in napua tower very friendly and accommodating. 2) Forced valet parking at $30 a day is not cool. I am more than happy to park my own car and walk. 3) Food and drink prices throughout the resort are obscene. So much so that we now purchase all food either from the grocery store or the general store in the mall next door. By the way, the general store has a fantastic lunch selection for cheap. We can afford to stay at the Grand Wailea, but don't appreciate being literally robbed for the price of a meal by the pool. $75 for a sandwich lunch for two is stupid. It's food, people! You only get to keep it for a few hours, if you know what I mean! 4) Beach umbrellas are free, which is a plus - you used to have to pay for them. However, they are in such poor condition that it makes the beach area so unattractive. They are faded, broken, lopsided. Look awful and not 5 star quality. 5) Pool area feels dirty. Bathrooms stink, pathways are filthy. We's given up on pool chairs during busy seasons because of the incredible hassle and lack of seating. 6) Napua tower rooms very noisy. People singing and drinking in bar in the middle, (one night large group drinking and toasting until midnight. Constantly yelling \"Salute!\"), and then large groups have dinner/luas on the lawn. Noise in stereo. Not relaxing for two adults not with a convention. 7) The general feeling is that you are being repeatedly violated. Absolutely nothing is free in this hotel and that makes people like me feel as if they have been taken advantage. It's a shame. Grand Wailea would do well to take lessons from the Ritz in customer service. The little free things make people feel welcome and special. So, Overall, just disappointed and saddened that this hotel feels like it is falling apart and that we are nickel and dimed at every corner. The rate you think you are paying is not really the rate. Add the valet, the resort charge, the resort tax and you've increased your rate by 150 a night. We are returning to Maui in June and for the first time in 18 years, we will not be staying at the Grand Wailea, but a neighboring hotel. Still absolutely love the area, but for the five star price, we are choosing to actually stay in a five star resort.

Some complained about the size. This is a very large resort; that part is true. What the complainers failed to say is to walk any distance at this resort is to be treated to stunning views throughout. There are sculptures, hidden waterfalls, secluded thatched huts, exotic flowers, green foliage of all kinds, palm trees, paintings ... everywhere that you look. Just the hotel grounds, without seeing any other part of the Island, delivers on the visual expectation and fantasy of what you hope to see when you visit Hawaii. I saw reviews about rooms not being up to par. We have had different types of rooms during our different stays at this property. Some have been average and others outstanding. None have been dirty or run down. Our last room was clearly remodeled and fabulous. Our room this time was older, very clean and also wonderful. The views are great. We've had pool views, garden views, ocean views... all great. I read some reviews that complained about not getting enough wrist bands for the pool, or having to pay 'too much' for wrist bands for non hotel guests. I can see that if someone is trying to \"sneak\" in a few extra people, that the hotel would hold to its policy and that does not bother me at all. The staff will ask for room numbers and names in order to provide bands. Once you see how easy it is to walk into the pool areas at the surrounding resorts, you change your mind about wearing wrist bands. It keeps the pool available for paying guests. The hotel fee is a fact of life as is the valet charge. No one likes fees. However, the car was delivered promptly and with fresh, cold bottles of water each time we called for it. Frankly, you really do not need a car. We always rent one, but for the first time this year, we took tours of some of the better known sights and it was well worth it. We were picked up at the hotel and returned to the hotel... no car needed. The food is great. My in-laws traveled to this hotel two weeks after we did. They had the opposite reaction: we loved the food at Humuhumu; they loved the Bistro Molokini (both restaurants at this resort). Our favorite restaurant used to be the Italian restaurant next door at the four seasons where table are outside and face the ocean. However, this year, the service and food at that venue disappointed, while Humuhumu outdid our expectations. We were also pleased with room service selections and taste. About a year or so ago we found that the Humuhumu fare was tasty but more like standard Hilton hotel fare. We can now say it is excellent. If you have children, the multiple, cascading pools, slides and rope swing will occupy them for hours. If you have small children, the little baby pool with little fountain and nearby sand covered pool entry where children play in the shallow water (which looks like a beach) will entertain you and the baby. From your chairs, you will hear the ocean surf in the background. There are lifeguards everywhere. This year I was at the foot of the big slide waiting to capture my husband on camera when he came hurtling out, when an older woman came down the slide first and then appeared disoriented as she stood coughing at the bottom of the slide. The lifeguard did not hesitate, he immediately was in the water, at her side. Her husband was laughing and she appeared embarrassed, but I was very impressed the rapid response as other resort staff also appeared to make sure all was well. We did not have children with us and have never traveled to this resort with children. However, we used all the pools, the slides and the lazy river just like the kids did and found there was room for all of us to safely and respectfully use the multiple pools. A bonus was the option to use the large sized adult-only pool with two large hot tubs. I was pleased that when children entered the adult-only hot tub or adult-only pool area, they were gently encouraged to leave. We debated staying at the four seasons this year, but the property just cannot compare to what is offered by the Grand Wailea. Even at its most crowded, when we returned from a tour late morning, we never had trouble finding two or more chairs together. There were also plenty of shaded areas. This year we noticed Super Cabanas with flat screen TVs and other amenities. The staff was very friendly. Housekeeping services were prompt and efficient. All the staff members were very friendly from housekeeping staff to groundskeepers, to the front desk and wait staff. Iced water was offered at the adult pool area. Are there any cons? It depends on who you are. If you like small, you can find private places there, but it is a large resort. If you want shiny and new, the resort is an older property, but there were signs of ongoing improvement throughout. The pool has some chipped tiles in places. Our room was a bit older, but beautiful. Our in-laws raved about their newly renovated room. All the rooms have giant bathrooms which is you like tiny bathrooms, could be a con. Is it expensive? Yes, it can be very expensive, but no more so than other luxury properties. Believe me, we looked at the other resorts.

I doubt we will travel to Hawaii again during this period since it is so much more crowded than what we are used to for Hawaii in April or October. Our main question for this trip was Ka'anapali beach on the east end of Maui or Wailea on the west end? The slight weather differences aside, go for Ka'anpali Beach. Our biggest complaint against the Grand Wailea, and this may be trivial to some, is the music ambiance & personnel - seriously. The swim up bar tender plays REO Speedwagon and Freebird....Freebird on Maui? Really? I'm paying premium money per night and per mai tai to sit in a bar to listen to Freebird?!?! With all the great Hawaiian Slack Key guitar Masters, John Cruz, Jack Johnson, etc. none of that is played here at the hotel. You hear U2 and old Police songs in the hotel restaurant (Molokini) which could be anywhere in California. For some reason, a lot of the personnel here are disinchanted haoles from the mainland, and not locals. Ou bottom line is - Ka'anapali gives a better overall selection of ambiance and is better located closer to Lahina for activities in Maui. Better LOCAL music scene on the east end of the island.

The shower had mold in it, the air vents were black with filth, and there was dirt on the walls itself. I know we paid the local rate but that doesn't give anyone the right to do such a poor job. When we complained to the manager, Hilme, he implied that since we shouldn't expect much since we were getting the local rate. Just because I was a savvy shopper and knew people on the island is no reason for their standards to be lax. Then, we found that the valet parking (which is mandatory) is pretty ridiculous considering they are charging 30 dollars for parking. Then, I found out that 30 dollars is not total for your stay but PER DAY, which is not mentioned anywhere, which is fraud by the way. We complained and the valet manager reversed the charges after apologizing for the \"miscommunication \". When we checked out, we complained about the many problems and the manager, Hilme again, told us that \"A hundred off is more than generous considering you got the local rate.\" Now, not only is that being prejudiced against the local Hawaiian people, that is also showing bias against their guests for being savvy shoppers. That's not even remotely approaching the level of class that we were expecting from the hotel for something that was not our mistake. I expected our stay to be comped and apologies abounding. Instead, I got apathy and rudeness. Now, I work for the Bellagio in Las Vegas and when I booked our stay, they told me that the Grand Wailea was the Bellagio of Maui. Unfortunately, from what we saw, the cleanliness and professionalism of the hotel is comparable to a low-class Days Inn. I am extremely disappointed in the level of service and customer care that we received and I will be relating that information to every guest at the Bellagio who asks for the best place to stay in Maui. I will now be referring people to the Kea Lani from now on. That \"should be more than generous\", as the manager put it. They should have cleaned the room thoroughly. They should not have defrauded and deceived people about the price of parking and if they were gonna charge for parking, they should have offered the option of self parking. It is a Waldorf property, and I expected impeccable cleanliness, style, and charm. Instead, I got attitude, mold, dirt, and a poor attitude.

First the great: We booked this hotel through Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays and got a bargain rate. When we checked in we were automatically upgraded to a ground floor, corner, large suite, with two large lanai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, containing two lanai loungers, and table and chairs. We had ocean and pool views. The suite was gorgeous! There was a large comfortable sitting area with flat screen, free WiFi, and separate dining area with refrigerator and sink. The large beautiful bedroom had another flatscreen and a huge marble bathroom with separate tub and shower. There was an additional half bath off the hall. This was a five star suite that we got for a three star price. The hotel itself is stunning with a beautiful lobby, gorgeous grounds, multiple pools, water slides, and a wonderful beach with great snorkeling and beach loungers and umbrellas for hotel guests. Wonderful shops for browsing in the hotel as well. Now to the down points, our room was a corner, ground floor suite, which we liked very much, but it was directly across from the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool so it was much like Disneyland all day, with shrieking children running all around. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like this quite as much! They were quiet at night though, which was a blessing. The hotel in general is very crowded even mid-week in February, with lots of families with young children. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide the quiet relaxed ambience we look for in Hawaii, so people seeking quiet relaxation may want to look elsewhere. This would be a great choice for families with young children though. The kids were all having the time of their lives! We generally prefer to eat in local restaurants over hotel restaurants, but we did take out one meal to eat on our lanai from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s casual Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kula. This was a mistake as the Asian themed food we ordered was dry, tasteless and seemed like it had been stored for a long time in the frig. Do not recommend Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kula. In conclusion, the room was stunning as was the hotel and grounds. The staff were friendly and helpful. The crowds and children were not really our cup of tea and the one meal we ate at the hotel was disappointing.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeyond Amazing\u201d", "Author": "totraveller12342", "ReviewID": "UR125074916", "Content": "The fabulousness of this hotel starts from the time you pull up and are greeted by a multitude of friendly staff and receive your welcome lei.

Over the years we have visited all of the Islands (that you can access) and this is our favorite spot. Our perspective is that of a family with grade school aged kids. The 3 reasons I would recommend staying here are the beach, the pools and the location. When you close your eyes and picture the perfect Hawaiian beach you are thinking of Wailea Beach. Very wide and long, golden sand, shallow entry into the water, small waves and there are reefs for snorkeling on both sides. The hotel staff will set you up with a large beach umbrella and lounge chairs. The water is warm, the bottom is sandy, boogie boarding with the kids is a blast, lots of room to build sand castles, its clean and kept immaculate by the staff. There is good snorkeling with turtles at both ends of the beach. You pay a lot to stay here, but it is so valuable to have access to this beach, to not have to drive and fight for a parking spot. It is about a 5 minute walk to the rooms. Tip: Buy a boogie board at the ABC store, don't rent one if you want to use it more than one day. Next are the pools. If you have kids or are young at heart you will love this. There are a series of pools built at different levels and connected by slides. There are 2 longer slides, one rapids, a fast river and a slow river, caves with hot tubs. My kids and I never got tired of it. Always clean, always warm, rarely crowded, most people seem content to lounge instead of play. A tip is to go out at night under the stars and enjoy the pools and hot tubs. Hardly anyone ventures to the pools after dark even though they are beautifully lit and tiki torches light the grounds. Third is Wailea. Oh my gosh, this is the best place to stay in Hawaii. The crowds of Kanapali make me claustrophobic. It is so much more relaxed in Wailea. The beach path connects the resorts which are widely spaced apart. Kihei is close by. We recommend the Kihei cafe (go early to beat the breakfast crowds and also keep track of what the cashier charges you, although the food was the best I don't think the overcharge was by accident) and try Da Kitchen for local food for dinner. Get takeout and eat on your Lanai watching the sun go down. If you want to get out and explore nearby we recommend Big Beach and Maluaka Beach with good snorkeling at the south end of each. Big Beach is amazing just to stop and behold it with your eyes. The valet parking staff were fast and friendly and loaded us up with towels and water. Negatives about the Grand Wailea. It is very expensive and the holiday rates are obscene. The restaurants are expensive too, but at least they are very good. Cafe Kula charges something like $14 for the banana taro pancakes but they are ono and enough for two people. Another tip is that it is only a 5 minute walk to the shops at Wailea. There are all kinds of cheap deli and prepared hot foods for takeout. Take the food back and eat on your lanai. The view is so much better. We ate at the Humuhumu one time. Really good but too expensive to go back. Never ate at the breakfast buffet, instead we bought cereal, muffins and milk at the ABC store next door. Concerning the rooms. We had a deluxe ocean view on the 9th floor. So we were kind of far back from the beach. But from what I could tell just about all of the rooms face the ocean. You pay more to be higher up. The four of us did fine in one room. There is a fridge and closet space. The bathroom is quite large and ours had a good luck gecko. I called to report that the next door neighbor was smoking on their lanai and hotel security came after them within minutes. All furnishings and beddings were top notch. Nothing shabby in our room. Maid service was great and they always made sure we had extra towels. In summary this is a beautiful resort, on a primo beach, in a super location. If you want to go out, drive around and explore everyday, then there is not much point in splurging on the cost of the Grand Wailea. On the other hand if you want a hassle free, idyllic beach vacation with your kids then this is the spot.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quincy, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSome good some bad not worth 400$ a night\u201d", "Author": "Babyjordan23", "ReviewID": "UR124772988", "Content": "Me and my wife decided to stay at The Grand Wailea after seeing it on the movie Just Go With It.

After changing clothes after an 8 hour flight we were starved and it was very hard to find somewhere to eat after 8pm and just getting out of the lobby needed help from Magellen only one elevator was working that you had to take to get to where the food was and that was a pain. We booked a kayak snorkel tour through the hotel paid a month ahead of time upon day of check in they had no record of it and said our credit card was not charged so we paid again and found out once we got home we were in fact charged twice. The tour was great though our tour guide brought me an octopus from the ocean floor to hold plus a sea urchin among other things. The grounds near the pool area were awesome we got many great pictures we also enjoyed the luau. The shops at wailea were nice with an abc store for cheap snacks and a restaurant called longhis was great we ate there 3 times and one of the waitresses was the best looking women ive ever seen. The pools were great and we never had any trouble getting chairs the walking path down the beach was also nice a good place to run. Complaints were the elevators broke the long walk to our room the quality of the room and the price of food was just unreal the first day i was ready to leave until i learned my way around then i really enjoyed it. We took 3 tours that all picked us up at the hotel that was nice.

Truly unbelievable what some hotels can afford ! We were shocked... I travel 200 days a year in always stay in 5 star accommodations, though was from far one of the worst experiences I had. We stayed in the Napua tower which is definitely not worth the money. Just a few examples : * internet in the room was down. It took nearly 24 hours to get it up and running again. The only workaround was to log on to the wireless network of the Four seasons hotel. At their reception, you can buy a voucher and log on, also from the Grand Wailea. * the toilet was broken (water). We reported it to the reception and it took more than 4 hours to get it fixed. * the room is old and is a typical example of gone glory with spots on the carpet, on the cushions of the terrace chairs. The paint of the wooden blinds is peeling off. When you open and close the blinds, the carpets looks white of all the pain which is dropping off. The taps in the bathroom has once been in gold. Probably a loooong time ago. You can still see some traces of it :). Which is a nice example for the rest of the hotel : once it was probably a nice resort, though only very few traces are left. * the Napua tower has a kind of exec lounge where you can take breakfast. In all honesty, the evening drink is nice with a good selection of cocktail, wine and beer. Though, the breakfast is awful. And you should see how the waiters are throwing the food in the trays. My God !!! The juices are just sugar water served (self served) in plastic cups. * when waking up during the night, I noticed that the mini-bar is empty. How do I get a quick drink ? Calling room service ???? We stayed before at the Four Seasons which is a paradise and an example of efficient service and style. Prices are very similar, though quality is day and night difference.

It is a lovely property and is well kept and very clean. When you first walk into the lobby it is very impressive and is as nice as any hotel we have been to. Room was large and very comfortable with spectacular views of the gardens, the ocean and the island. It is a busy place with many children having a lot of fun in the pools. There was a lot of laughter from the kids and their parents and everyone was having a good time. I think this sums up the property...if you are a family it is wonderful place to have fun and connect with your kids. What more do you want from a vacation! Although we enjoyed watching the children (who were generally pretty well behaved) we are long past those years. We probably would have enjoyed the place more if it had been a little quieter. The beautiful lawn in front of the adult pools was quiet and away from most of the hustle and bustle so we enjoyed that. The hotel does a large convention business but they have done an excellent job of keeping the conference activities (meals etc.) in a separate area from the main hotel. A separate entrance for conference goers keeps the main entrance clear of piles and piles of luggage when masses of people check out at one time at the end of the conference. We thought the food could be better and although it was well presented it reminded us of food in an upscale chain restaurant. It was a little mass produced and sometimes looked thrown together. The staff were friendly and competent but some looked like they were bored and in a rut but others were some of the nicest people you could ever meet. There have been a lot of comments about the prices of food etc. but we found that the prices were only a little higher than restaurants in the surrounding area.

Our check-in experience as a Hilton top-tier hhonors member was very poor and they provide no benefits at this property for the HHonors members (not even daily bottled water or newspaper). We were not given any information on the rate for the daily resort fees, the fact that there was a house keeping gratuity automatically charged (and we left one in the room every day for the house keeping staff since we didn't know this). Check-out was also not accommodating nor helpful. My conference negotiated a great price and special resort fee that included the valet parking (but I didn't find out the correct information on the resort fees until checkout). The valets were very efficient, friendly and provided suggestions and advice on local attractions and restaurants when asked. The concierge desk didn't seem familiar with hiking opportunities on the island, but unlike us. most people probably come for the water sports. They did mainly try to push arranged tours and packages. Also, they suggested leaving the hotel by 2am to make it up to Haleakala summit for sunrise (which she claimed was at 6am)-- that would have meant waiting several hours in the cold for the sun to rise. We left the hotel at 4:30am and arrived in the overflow parking lot at 6:30am with 30 minutes before sunrise (since it was actually at 7am) with only a few people in the overflow lot and a great view.

On top of that, the photographer from Amity Photography (who was recommended from the resort) could not have been worse. She never responded to emails, phone calls or requests to meet before the wedding day. She showed up at the Bridal Suite more than 30 minutes late looking like she just came in from the beach. Very unprofessional lady and dressed so poorly for a five star resort. When my cousin said \"I was so stressed, I thought you were not going to show up\" the photographer said nothing. She just started taking pictures and laughed it off. The bride was close to a meltdown. She was already in her wedding gown and there was little time to capture the moment with photographs. The photos we received were nothing like the images from her web site. One saving grace was the amazing Videographer from The Artistry Video Company (also recombined by the resort) She arrived 30 minutes early & captured all the details (that the photographer missed) The Video DVD looks like a motion picture-truly a work of art. The Florist from Bella Bloom (referred by the resort) was also wonderful to work with. She was professional and her flower arrangements were beautiful and fresh! After the wedding day, we attempted to contact the lead coordinator in the wedding department but we were told she was not available and would return our call. Of course we never heard a word from her. Upon our departure, we left a personal hand written letter at the front desk for the resort Manager Mr. Daily and Mr. Brian Lynx, Director of Marketing.

The manager was rather unfriendly, and was minimally interested in giving us even a token compensation for the inconvenience of relocating us the next day. To their credit, the new room featured a much better view.

We were also somewhat disappointed with their approach toward the Hilton Honors program. We were offered few extra amenities for our Diamond status - although it may have been because we booked the room through the convention, instead of doing it through our own account. This is a good resort for people who have children - the extensive pools and the ready access to the beach were a plus here. There was also a nice area for an adult pool. The restaurants were predictably pricey with average quality food. The food service at the pool was slow and spotty.

We paid a conference price (which, despite a number of negotiated reductions, was still not even close to cheap), and this is a very nice hotel. The room and bathroom were nice, well equipped and spacious; however, for a 5 star hotel, this place was seriously lacking (or at least inconsistent) in terms of service. The pool was open until 10pm at night, and we decided at 9pm one night that we wanted to go for a quick dip. We erred around the pool area for 10 minutes to get some towels, but none were to be found (and no life guard or any other staff), so we ended up going back up to our room after the swim dripping. We were able to get beach towels (from an utterly disinterested lady) at the towel counter the next morning. In our room, there was a nice card that said \"Service with Aloha\" and \"In anticipation of your receipt of our emailed satisfaction survey, we'd like to know what we can do *now* to make your stay more enjoyable. Please share your comments or special requests with us on this card which we will retrieve during our next service.\" I noted the lack of pool towels on the card, which I was able to take home because room service never bothered to retrieve it. There was a coffee maker in the room, and we made coffee the first morning (we cleaned up the coffee grinds that were all over the machine from the previous occupant) and the second (we re-assembled the machine correctly after room service had re-assembled it incorrectly after cleaning). By the third morning, we had run out of the two packs of coffee that were in our room when we arrived. We asked at the front desk for a refill, and when we came back to our room after dinner, we had six (6) packs of coffee - wow. The telephone was really dusty, and we were charged a long-distance call instead of the local call that I made (they took it off the bill when we mentioned it at check-out). At check-out, the lady did not bother to ask whether we had enjoyed our stay, whether we had found everything alright, or anything like it. Don't get me wrong, these are all little things. For an expensive 5-star hotel like the Grand Wailea, though, it was quite disappointing to see such spotty service and disinterested attitude. Everybody can build and maintain a nice hotel with nice rooms and large bathrooms; it is the service that sets apart an excellent hotel from an average one.

On New Year's Eve, while I was walking at the hotel's main entrance, I almost got kicked out of the grounds because I didn't have my room key when security stopped me. It was unsettling and unpleasant. Despite the service issues and the crowds, the resort is as fabulous as ever. I sincerely doubt there is a resort in the world as beautiful as the Grand Wailea.

It seems that these areas don't really fit the size of the hotel. Food is a real problem in this hotel. There are several restaurants but all were quite disappointing.

Some quick tips: 1) before you buy all the toys and boards your kids desire check lost and found. People leave a ton of toys behind and there were boogie boards and sand toys left on the beach almost every day. We gave away our board and toys the last day of our stay and many others do the same. 2) there is a Pizza Hut that delivers and it was probably the dinner our kids enjoyed best :) 3) the drive to Hana and the drive up the volcano are a problem for those with motion sickness...", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGrand but expensive\u201d", "Author": "amb614", "ReviewID": "UR122886516", "Content": "A vast hotel and with extensive grounds, so it's very difficult to find one's way around at first, and we often felt we were in a maze.

One of the other guests, a frequent visitor, told us to get a good spot and make sure to lie on the lounges at least once an hour or the hotel would remove our stuff and give the lounges to someone else. I had never heard of such a crazy scenario, but it did indeed happen to us. I guess we lost track of time at the beach. When we returned to the lounges someone else was sitting there and our things were gone. My first reaction was that it was all stolen but then I remembered the cautionary tale from earlier in the day. I went to the towel desk to tell them what happened and was treated like some sort of criminal. I didn't know how to react, so I just didn't. Security came by moments later and apologized for the rules and gave me back my stuff. He was very polite and professional. From then on we just sat on the beach - the pool was too competitive. I can understand the reason for this rule as the hotel is tremendous and caters to large groups and conferences. There just are not enough lounges for every guest. Though we did not sit at the pool, the kids loved the pool. There is a water elevator, several slides, waterfalls and rivers. Great fun for them. Our room was super.

From the moment we checked in, I started having second thoughts about staying here. The front desk staff seemed mildly annoyed that we were bothering them to check in. The room we had requested was taken and we were led to a room that was not nearly as nice as the one we remembered, and we paid even more for it this time. The second day of our stay my husband and I were having a good time going down the slide. On my last run, I felt a thud on the side of my head, but didn't think too much of it until one of the other swimmers yelled at me that I was bleeding from my head. Apparently, as I popped out of the slide chute, I slammed my head on one of the boulders outlining the pool. The hotel security took me to a back room where they called medics to look at my wound. Thankfully, I didn't have a concussion, but I did need to have stitches. Once I was deemed healthy enough to walk, the security guard pointed my husband in the direction of the nearest medical facility and we drove ourselves there. Eight stitches later, we returned to the hotel. We never heard from anyone at the hotel to check in on how I was doing - no phone call, no note, no nothing. I didn't expect anything from them except common courtesy and compassion and perhaps a call from the manager on duty. Two days later we checked out and again, the front desk was less than friendly. We've told this tale to several people and have been told that the hotel does a great job of marketing to reel the people in, but their customer service is severely lacking once you check-in. Needless to say, we will never return to this property and tell people all the time to stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay at the Grand Wailea. . . especially during XMAS\u201d", "Author": "JCTraveler1104", "ReviewID": "UR122533524", "Content": "Just got back from Xmas week at the Grand Wailea and I will NOT go back. I simply cannot comprehend the postive reviews this hotel has received. And, if one person who reads my comments decides against the Grand Wailea, I will be happy because I will have saved someone lots of money (and time!). Perhaps if the room were $200.00 a night and my expectations were lower I could accept some of the failings but even then . . . I must begin by describing the most ridiculous aspect of this hotel, which, by the way, is not the poorly decorated, dirty, dated hotel rooms, but rather, the line for beach chairs. As another hotel guest stated while waiting on line for chairs, \"the system is demeaning.\" Be prepared to be on line well before 7:30 am and to wait for at least twenty minutes to half an hour. Then, be ready to be told sometimes (this was not the case each day), you can only get two beach towels even though there are 5 people in your party and you have paid for two hotel rooms. Then walk to the beach, give your ticket to the men placing the beach chairs, and be sure to be armed with extra t-shirts, magazines, books, etc so that you can hold your place while you run back into the hotel to grab breakfast (and this is not quick feat either as there is a wait here too) or wake up your kids! Even these steps won't guarantee you will have seats when you come back. Twice, two of our unmanned chairs were \"stolen.\" As for service, it's average to non-existent. The front desk people were uninterested and other than a server here or there in the restaurants, nobody seemed at all as if they cared about your stay. I guess I can't blame them. The hotel is HUGE and has many rules; I assume they have no choice but to enforce them. If you are used to staying at more service oriented hotels, do not even consider staying at the Grand Wailea, you will be disappointed and annoyed. Last, I expected the restaurants, the spa, and the stores to be expenisive but it seems as if everywhere this hotel is trying to charge for something (i.e. fitness classes other than 7:00 am yoga). In fact, upon checking in you are told that there is $20.00 per day charge per room on top of the room charge and taxes and on top of valet and on top of the $50.00 a day connecting room charge, should you want connecting rooms guaranteed. And, one tale I must relate was when I asked for a copy of my bill the night before we checked out and I was told by the front desk person that there would be a $2.25 charge to deliver it to my room. (I actually hadn't asked for it to be delivered, just that it be ready but she obviously wasn't listening, like the people at the pool who kept aksing me for my information to get a bracelet when all I said I wanted was a towel.) To spend hard earned money on a hotel with so many flaws and one with a general vibe of disinterest just doesn't feel good. It was only once I accepted all the problems (though it was hard to get over the bathroom) and reminded myself that I was lucky to be in beautifu lMaui, that I was able to enjoy myslef.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place for our family of 4\u201d", "Author": "MikelikesDisney", "ReviewID": "UR122516775", "Content": "It is the hotel that other family hotels should be compared.

We got the wrist bands when you got the towels, my one daughter never got one but it was no issue. I am a HH Gold member and used points, they gave me an upgraded room, the room was large and had an awesome view of the chapel and ocean, ground floor near the spa and workout facilities (I did not try the spa but the workout room were super nice; smoothies for after for free, towels in ice for your face, flowers on the desk, wood paneling; you get the picture).

We ate in Kihei otherwise which is close with many excellent choices. The lobby was decorated super nice for the holidays and the drive up to the hotel with the trees all lit up was also stunning.

The beds were very comfortable and its still some of the greatest sleeps that I have ever had. The bathroom was also very nice. Definitely the best bathroom I have ever had at a hotel before. It was great to really nice to open the front door to the room every morning and have a view of the mountains and swaying palm trees. The balcony on the other end of the room had a great view of the ocean and gardens around the property. The pool was nice and surprisingly quiet when I was there. Only certain times of the day would the pool be crowded and the adult pool is quiet all day long. They had a great walking path along the beach and I really enjoyed taking daily walks along that path (which lead to other nearby hotels including the Four Seasons right next door. The landscaping and dramatic views along the path were something that you would never experience outside of Hawaii! There were a few negatives though... - The food was not good at Humahumanukanukaapuaa. Something must have burnt in the kitchen so the entire restuarant had a burned smell to it toward the end of my dining experience. It really was terrible. The food at the bar in the lobby was very good though and there are some nice restaurants nearby. - There are not a lot of chairs at the beach. Get to the beach early. If you wait until 12am, there is a good chance that most of the lounge chairs will be gone. However, the beach is not that crowded even though it is technically a public beach. - The water current gets very strong after about 1pm. I went canoeing along the beach one day and the current was so strong that in just a matter of minutes I could barely see the beach. It was diffucult to paddle back and a bit scary knowing that there is nothing but 1000s of miles of ocean beyond the beach. However, if you are just swimming along the beach and you dont go out too far, you should have no problems with strong currents, expecially early in the morning when the water is actually very calm most days. - The location of the hotel, while beautiful, was a bit out of the way of everything. The area where the hotel was, was far away from any major cities. It seemed like the area mostly had large mansions, other luxury hotels, and some decent shopping areas. It would have been a bit more convienent of the hotel was nearby to a larger town. I highly recommend this hotel.

The rooms are okay, but nothing too special considering the price and the constant nickel and dining that guests receive ($25 just to park there).

The property is amazing with beautiful gardens, paths with sitting areas and peaceful streams fed by waterfalls. The pool complex is phenomenal; the most impressive I've seen in all my travels. Excellent for my 6 yr old. Love the fast slides, water elevator and rope swing. There are ample seating areas and we always found vacant chairs. The pool service is terribly inattentive for this level of resort, you need to order for the next hour as you won't see them for another 45 minutes. They could learn from Vegas or Bali. Food and drink prices are high, but you don't book a place like this and expect $3 beers and $5 burgers; it is what it is... Beach staff is fantastic, and I highly recommend getting one of their \"all you can use\" packages. Great beach for kids. Suggest you hit the beach before the winds pick up in the afternoon. Restaurants are good. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet and happy hour at Humuhumunukunukuapuaa. Their butterfish is fantastic. Prices are high, but once again that's to be expected. Kula Cafe was decent and more affordable, but they need someone on their staff that speaks English (I grew up in HI, so understand this is no slight against Pidgin but a comment to 1st generation foreign workers in the service industry). They screwed up every order. Be sure to double check your order. The shops are good, but Kula definitely screws up the flow of retail continuity and should've been put at the end of retail row.

The waiter staff on the lawn serving the Bisto are outstanding. Friendly and super-hardworking!!

I was a bit worried after reading reviews that the hotel would be overrun with families. Was this going to be the Chuck E. Cheese of Maui beach hotels? Far from it. Yes, there were a lot of families spending their holidays at the hotel, but because the property is SO big, there were pockets of respite from kids. Reflecting now, it's odd that as we didn't want to be surrounded by kids, we never spent time at the adult only pool (though we did walk through a couple times and never heard the kids at the kid pool). We were able to control our kid exposure. Went down the slides and lazy river, had lunch at the bar and then on to the spa. While this was only my second spa experience and I'm not the best judge, my wife (a spa regular) thoroughly enjoyed her time there. Other comments: - All the staff there were pleasant and friendly. - We had a deluxe room on the top floor (9) and it was perfect. Would not have wanted anything smaller. View of sunset was awesome. We liked that we could see the ocean from our bed when we woke up. - The shopping center was a close 5 minute walk away, which was nice when we had to pick up forgotten clothes, snacks and other sundries. I only wish we could have had our act together and done it all in 1 trip. - If I was going to be super judgmental, I could probably remember 1 or 2 things I saw that stood out as being less than great in the room. But they were so minor in the grand scheme, I moved on after seeing them, and enjoyed the rest of the room. - Humuhumu was pretty good. Our 5-course meal was part of the package we booked. We enjoyed our meal. My steak had more pepper than I prefer, but it didn't stop me from finishing it. It was actually too much food. We opted to have dinner after the sunset (6pm), but I can see how that would be a great place for dinner during the sunset. - The concierge was very helpful in arranging a snorkel excursion for us with an outfit outside the hotel. At first we asked if they could help us schedule the kayak and snorkel tour at the hotel, but then suggested and external option for a little more money. So worth the extra cost. It was definitely a highlight of the trip (the snorkel trip, not the concierge experience). - A ding on the sleep quality only because I was woken up every morning to the sound of a cart rolling by outside on the tile hallway.

In the short time since our previous visit I was disappointed and dismayed to find how much the Resort has slipped in its appearance and performance. Housekeeping is truly less that thorough with dirty bathroom floors, furniture surfaces left soiled and unclean. The rooms are showing their age in terms of dinged and damaged furnishings, broken lamp shades. chips on walls and scratched, soiled painted surfaces. Cupboards not closing properly and calls for repairs unanswered. We even left the \"repair card\" which is deposited in each room by the staff to notify them of any problems and this was never tended to nor answered. The breakfast buffet has simply lost its quality and execution. Most foods tasted bland and were either under/overcooked. Mediocre at best considering the hi price you pair for breakfast each morning in the Grand Dining Room. My biggest grip and huge shock was to see the mistreatment and disregard for guests at the main pool area (adult). 14-16 casabellas each morning with eight louge chairs a piece usurped by the staff with white towels as \"reserved for paying guests\" . Well at $1000 a day it was no surprise that only 2-3 three of these casabellas were ever rented during our week stay. This in turn left approx 96 poolside chairs unavailable to the rest of the guests who were inconvenienced and displaced out onto the lawn when the few chairs that remained poolside were grabbed up by guests as early as 7a.m. Not a person in sight to assist guests when they had to shuttle chairs out onto the lawn since nothing was left poolside and again only 2-3 casabellas occupied with 8 chairs each UNUSED. This is ridiculous and a slap in the face to paying guests who are already shelling out a minimum of $500/nite to stay here. 96 chairs left unusable ALL DAY LONG just in case someone MIGHT rent them and NO ONE did. This is completely unacceptable, bad business and the poorest way to treat guests. We all understand the economy is bad, but should paying guests be put out, put off and displaced by the uncertain hope/wish that maybe just MAYBE someone will rent a casabella and take the 8 chairs, or should they make a policy that unless one is reserved by the night before or 9a.m. that morning the rest should be left open and the 8 chairs they contain available to all guests . This has left a huge distaste in my mind and feeling that we will not be returning let alone recommending others to visit.

From the moment we arrived (at night) with the tiki torches lit and drove past the waterfalls near the main entrance we knew we had made the right choice. The hotel itself is beautiful and serene with huge public spaces open to the soft winds and enchanting views. The grounds are expansive with hidden gardens and water features everywhere. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably read about all the art at the hotel, yes its everywhere, but well integrated and tastefully displayed. The room we stayed in had a great ocean view and was generally very quiet. The ate at all the restaurants and the food and service was great - to bad the main dining room was closed for renovations as we would have liked to try it also. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly and not at all pretentious. The pools and beach are we always well maintained and we never had any trouble finding a lounge. If you have kids this is the place to go - the water park with its slides and river pools is fantastic. My wife even went on the water slide several times and loved it. They even have a little kids beach area at one of the numerous pools - neet. We spent most of our laying about time (so much to do on Maui that we were almost always on the go) by one of the hidden pools which was quiet and peaceful. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pool was too frustrating - what with all the phones, tablets and laptops and b.s. - you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on vacation people. The shops of Wailea are a short stroll away, lots of places to spend your money and a few really good restaurants. There is not much nightlife at the hotel but Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the SoW has a great happy hour from 10 pm onwards. And there's nearby Kihei with tons of dining and nightlife. Ajacent to the Grand Wailea are several other beautiful hotels (within walking distance) with more upscale dining options. Overall we had a fantastic vacation not the least due to the wonderful friendly people of Maui and knowing that after a full day of touring we had this beautiful resort to come back to.

The stay was widely shaped but the warm and welcoming front desk person that checked us in. I cannot remember his name as it was over a month ago - he was a wonderful Filipino gentleman that has been with the hotel for many years. Given our Hilton status, he upgraded us to one of the most gorgeous ocean front rooms we've ever seen. He threw in a number of extras as we were celebrating our anniversary and have a baby on the way. We actually decided to stay an extra evening thanks to his hospitality. We stayed at the Four Seasons for our honeymoon 5 years prior. We were nervous about the Grand Wailea because we thought it would be flooded with kids and not comfortable for a couple. We were pleasantly surprised. Luckily, the pool area is so vast that there is an area for everybody - an adult pool area (which they strictly enforced), a pretty beach area, and a large pool area full of waterfalls, slides, and the like (this area is well-maintained and clean minus the bathroom - yuck, that could use a bit more cleaning). It could have to do with the fact that we visited in October, but we never felt overwhelmed with kids. This sort of resort certainly attracts jerky adults (we had to move away from overly indulged businessmen on vacation a few times, and if you scroll down to the woman that refused to wear a wristband review, you'll get a sense of what I mean), but our enjoyment of the grounds, the outstanding customer service, and overall beauty of the property more than made up for a few sour apples. Our room was top-notch from the extremely comfrtbale bed linens to the highly luxurious bathroom. They skimped on nothing. We had a lovely dinner at the Humumumu (if I recall correctly) - great service althought the food was standard hotel food - nothing to write home about.

We had a wonderful stay. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by \"Rose\" with a fresh flower Lei. Our check in was great with Christina...we were given a roon in the \"NAPUA tower\" which was wonderful. Our room was beautiful with and ocean view although not a sunset view which would have been even better but we are not complaining as it was still wonderful. The rooms are large with comfortable beds, a large Lanai and a large bathroom with a huge tub and seperate shower. In the Napua tower you get complimentary breakfast and happy hour every day. Both were very good. The breakfast always offered at least one hot item and plenty of fresh fruits, breads, cheeses ect. the happy hour we really loved...in part because of the Hostess 'Zenith\" after the first night she knew us by name and would bring us fresh drinks without even having to walk up to the bar. She was so cheerful and fun! again there was always a hot appetizer and lots of finger foods. The lobby at the Grand Wailea is amazing...open air with a main bar that we went to every night. The bartender \"KEONIE\" was fantastic...so much fun and so welcomimg and again knew our names and drinks by the 2nd night. the managment should be very proud to have employess like him and Zenith among others. THE POOL...Huge and fun...I don't know if i would be so enthusiastic about it during high season but we were there when it was not horribly crowded and there was always a chair to be had and we had fun on the slides. I would say it is a little overwhelming but still fun. We loved the grotto bar and the bartender that was there most days..i can not remember his name but he was great. A downside...we had friends staying on different parts of the island and we wanted to have them over to ''show off\" our resort! We totally understand the wrist band deal..we were told there was really no exceptions and no guests were allowed w/o a hefty charge. They said we could rent a cabana and then have the guests. the only cabana that would accomadate all of us was the \"super cabana\" the charge for the day was $1000.00...YIKES! After some talking we were given a price of $800.00 for the day (still..YIKES, especially because it was not crowded and there were plenty of empty cabanas!) With this price came, water, soda and a platter of sandwhiches...it was difficult to get service from the cabana people but the pool bar waiter \"Adrian\" waited on us for drinks we purchased and he was fabulous! Next time we will just know that we will not invite any guests!!! We ate dinner one night at Humus for our anniversary and we LOVED it! We can't wait to go back to the Grand Wailea! i know I have missed some things but all in all a great vacation! (beautiful beaches, less crowded then kaanapali) Eat breakfast next door at Lohngi's at the shops at Wailea..really good and the shops are amazing. pretty walk as well. The whole beach walk in the front of the reorts is just lovely. We went next door to the four Seasons for dinner one night..VERY expensive and not as good as Humu's in our opinion!

We went to Maui Dive Shop and payed 125$ for a two-tank boat dive per person. Shop around ! Grand Luau: although the dancers are very good, the show is really basic. No decor and simple dances.

The staff there were very friendly and accommodating. There was confusion regarding our reservations in terms of how many individuals were in our hotel room and they handled it with the utmost of professionalism, making sure we all had breakfast included with our room and also waived the per person / per day resort fee. The staff at breakfast remembered us every morning and chatted with us like old friends. The grounds are breathtakingly beautiful. The Grand Wailea obviously takes a lot of pride in making sure everything is perfectly manicured and landscaped. The pools are immaculate and the areas around the pools are also clean and inviting. I also liked that you had to get wrist-bands to get towels and use the pool areas; considering there are a lot of resorts in the Wailea area, I like that the Grand Wailea keeps a close eye on making sure that the people using the pool are registered hotel guests. Our room was also a pleasant surprise. The bathroom was huge and updated, and the bedroom itself was incredibly roomy, even for U.S. standards. We were upgraded to an ocean-view room and were not disappointed; it was lovely to watch the sunrise from our linai every morning! The room was clean and modern and they brought us extra towels, pillows and other amenities within minutes of calling the front desk. Plus, the beds were extremely comfortable! The Spa Grande was to die for. My girl friend and I booked massages for our first day and they were incredible. Afterward, we received a complimentary body scrub and then spent a good amount of time in the soaking tubs. I could have spent all day in the spa. The whole resort is very quiet and peaceful which made for a very relaxing time there. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the prices. Obviously when you go to a very upscale resort you expect high prices but the Grand Wailea really gouges you. I'm talking $20 for a drink by the pool and they also have higher prices at the pool-side bars than in the restaurants. I've lived in a big city for quite some time so my husband and I are not shocked by $15 glasses of wine or $20 cheeseburgers, but the Grand Wailea seemed pricey even to us.

Is worth to say that these were just amazing !!! Now the review......The Grand Wailea is located at the wonderful beach of Wailea, where you will see some of the most beatiful sunsets of hawaii (maybe just below the ones at the Mauna Kea in big island). If you are looking for a good place with a nice beach and some fun at the pool you will do the right choice of staying there. Nevertheless there were few things that I dislike. First, I was in low season and there were a lof of space and very few people. But I can not imagine how that would be in high season. There are not too many chairs by the pool (at least way less chairs than rooms). Second at 5 pm everything dies at the pool. The really damn nice waterslide dies at 5 pm so does the pool bar (Which was just great !!!) but not just at the pool also the chairs and umbrellas will be picked up at the beach. Besides that and the terrifying high prices, I paid for a Scuba diving (1 tank) as much as I paid for a boat trip with 2 tanks and an underwater scooter elsewhere !!! The room was just amazing !!! The ocean view was just awesome and at least the one I had was clean, everything was working and the bath was georgeous. It is worth to say that the ladies who does the cleannin in the room deserves an A++++ my room was always clean and in order. Which really amaze me. I am a mess and I had everything spread all over the room. They really took timne to place everything in order. The best thing is that you have twice a day room service. In the morning and somewhere around sunset. Fresh towels and refill of the things you used in the morning (cream, shampoo, etc.). The Spa was just nice. I had a visit for a massage. I could do it all over again, it was so relaxing always fresh fruit and water (BTW the pineapple juice at the hotel, near the front desk, is just delicious). You can relax at the different hawaiian salt water jaquzzi (not sure if is well written). The people at the Spa also deserve an A++++ Contrary to the people at the front desk. On my very first night I had a trouble with my credit card and I had to contact my bank (in Germany) the people at the deskt (at night) have no idea how to an internationall phone call !!!! I was shockedd, they just couldn't do it. Also they did not provide any solution at all. They were like you can call using your card (but my credit card was not working !!!!) they seemed not to understand that, and I couldnot charge it to my room becuase they couldnot manage that. So in few words I was really disapointed that they did not even offer some kind of solution,. While they were at the pc on the front desk looking for the phone of my bank I asked her If I could go over and look it myself (I know there I find it) they refused !!! Hard to believe no..? Else the ladies (two) at the entrance of the buffet breakfast are quite rude !!! No good morning no ALOHA spirit just nothing, good for me in my 6 days I went just twice, the other days I went diving and had something in the boat. The valet parking as you may read in few other reviews it will take around 20 mins. So the best thing to do is before going out call and ask for your car. Then most of the time by the time you are there the car will be arriving. It happend to me few times (5). Anyways in case you do not want to read the complete review I will just tell you this. If you are going with your kids in a low season holiday make yourself and your kid a favor and stay at the hotel.

The hotel is truly stunning and the location and views could not have been more fantastic. We are seasoned travelers and have been all over the world in many kinds of hotels. Our travel philosophy is that you make your own fun wherever you are, and if you don't have a good time, it's your own fault. But being experienced travelers, sometimes it's the small things--the annoying things--that you remember the most. And in a 5-Star, First Class resort like the Grand Wailea, the little, negative details seem spotlighted more because you hold this kind of resort to a higher standard. As with other reviewers, we found the chaise lounge situation around the Hibiscus pool to be problematical--most were \"taken\" for hours--and those that were available were \"cheek by jowl\" with others. And then there's the colored wrist band deal to get towels (not terribly classy), especially when, after bringing our towels up to the pool from the beach (where we did not need wristbands) were were ordered by the pool staff that both my husband and I had to go in person back down the stairs to the activity desk to get wristbands. COME ON!! It was hot, my husband is 90 years old and was a bit tired, and I explained this to the young man on duty. No dice! \"Both of you have to go back down and get wrist bands.\" I did find check-in to be less than welcoming or helpful. We were told our room was not ready and they would call our cell phone when it was. Fine . . . we'll go have some lunch. But after nearly 2 hours, no call, so we went back upstairs to find out ourselves the room was ready; and it was a fine room with a beautiful view. But there was no explanation by the check-in clerk as to where anything in the hotel was located--just a perfunctory check in, sign here, here are your keys--.and the Grand Wailea is a BIG property! This would have been helpful. One final comment is the price of food and drink. Just expect to be astonished--no matter how deep your pockets are! I opted to have a \"proper\" breakfast in the Grand Dining Room our last morning--and I was both underwhelmed and overwhelmed. Underwhelmed by the cold potatoes, cold sausages and hard scrambled eggs. This was no lavish buffet breakfast as one might expect. And overwhelmed by the $30+ price.

Could have done with some information from reception (how to get to pools, restaurants etc - a map of resort would have helped) (turned out there was a map in the key folder but I didn't notice for a few days). However, the kids and I loved it - thought the pools were great, loved going down the water slides which are the best I've ever experienced at a hotel) and the water was beautifully clean and kept at the perfect temperature. We only ate poolside or at Bar Molokini and would only recommend Bar Molokini, however, that might reflect that we are not American and don't really like some foods like that really yellowy-orange melted cheese that comes with nachos. Bar Molokini's kids' menu was fine for my fussy eaters and they both seemed perfectly happy with what they had (chicken, pasta and the pizza). My food was fine. The service is very efficient, but I did find I had to seek out help once our food had appeared, there was no follow up to see if all was ok with the meal etc. (Meal was fine, I just wanted to order a drink). Staff all nice excepting one un-smily woman at reception. I wanted to book another night, and she gruffly presented the tariff sheet - I said \"yes, but that's never what is charged\" (can't remember what the price was, but am pretty sure the original ocean-view with 2 queen beds rate she showed me was either $699 or $1100 (I only glanced before doing my \"I don't think so\" routine) and when I mentioned another staff member had quoted me much less she said \"okay, $369\".) She was just one of those bitter and twisted types I think, as her manner was certainly from the resentful of other people having a holiday brigade, but everyone else was perfectly lovely. Ordered a cab from my room but it obviously hadn't been ordered when I rocked up to hop in it. Took a bit of encouragement but it was only when I mentioned that if we were late for our planned activity and missed out that I'd have the hotel pay our expenses that they felt my sense of urgency. That being said, when I ordered a taxi directly from them the next time, it was seemless and very well executed. Did appreciate the plentiful towels in the room, and getting heaps of towels for the pool area was no problem either. One real highlight was the nighttime Camp Grande - my 2 kids (7 and 10) absolutely loved it - more than any other kids club they have experienced anywhere. That is a real reflection on the wonderful staff manning Camp Grande - I can't thank them enough for that. It's not cheap ($95 per kid with 15% discount if you have 2 enrolled) but they certainly loved it. It only operates if 3+ kids are enrolled though. Overall, I'd have to say that it was a seriously good destination with the kids.

It is definitely a splurge though and wished there weren't extra resort charges and valet only parking but we expected that given it's status as a luxury resort and a Waldorf Astoria resort at that.

Lush and they experience the best weather on Maui. The hotel is well maintained and the gardens are gorgeously attended to. The staff are warm, friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms are very nice, kind of that timeless classic - not too modern or too outdated. The spa is fantastic! The best I've ever been to. They make you feel right at home and offer a very nice bath variety and pool sitch for you to lounge before your treatments. Your treatments are kicked off by a total body loofah scrub. The spa was worth every penny! The room service was just ok, but what do you expect from room service? It was prompt and had all the amenities and more to make a nice evening in. Yes, there is only valet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast, super convenient and friendly. And each time you get in, there are cold bottles of water for your drive. Resort fee includes unlimited wi-fi with no limit to number of devices. The pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so fantastic! So many water slides, tarzan rope swing, water elevator (I know, right!?) and swim up bar complete the twisty pool path through the amazing gardens. Truly a well done pool environment, not at all boring. Something for everyone. The Huma Huma (hut) restaurant was very good. They open at 5:30pm, but to get in perfect view for a sunset you need to get there at 5?? There were people already in the best tables when we arrived at 5:30 (again, when they officially opened\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), but the food was still good and the sunset was still awesome, even if we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the front row to enjoy it. There is happy hour in the lobby bar from 5-6, which helps kick start your evening in an otherwise pricey drink environment. You simply must use the shoreline path to get next door to the Four Seasons for Duo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a most terrific steakhouse which does a fantastic breakfast buffet as well. Seriously, the rooms are 3x the price, so stay at Grand Wailea and crash Four Seasons for the great restaurant.

We stayed in the Napua Tower in room 9055 overlooking the pools, ocean, and mountains. We had a great two room suite with a great living area and bedroom. The best part though was the lanai with a table, four chairs, and a lounge chair perfect for relaxing in the morning and enjoying breakfast and a cup of coffee or guava juice. The Napua Tower offers it's own complimentary continental breakfast in the morning as well as cocktails in the evening. Zenith at the cocktail reception is warm and welcoming and very friendly!

Upon arrival, we found out that due to a large conference we would be upgraded to a condo across the street at Ho'olei. Therefore this review focuses on all the amenities of the property, but not the rooms. For starters, this property is quite impressive. The grounds are huge and extremely well maintained. I couldnt get over how clean everything was. When you walk in through the main entrance, the place is palatial and beautiful. Check in was a breeze due to our late arrival, and we were happy to be given a voucher for a complementary bottle of champagne at one of the property's restaurants. We were given lei's upon our arrival, and everyone was extremely helpful, but not overbearing. The majority of our time was spent at the pool and beach while we were on the property. The beach staff was great, and we didnt have to wait more than 5 minutes to be setup with our chairs and umbrella. This could very well be a result of us coming during the off season, and that the majority of the guests on site were part of a corporate conference. There were very few children on the property during our stay, so we really were able to enjoy some relaxation. The beach is pristine and the water is calm. I do wish there was drink service on the beach, however. The pool area was also great. I had read so many horror stories about not getting chairs etc, but we never had a problem. Even if we showed up after 10am, finding a spot was a breeze. The number of pools is mind boggling. We let the kids inside of us have fun on the slides, tarzan swing and even took a ride on the very cool water elevator. We were lucky and never felt forced to go to the adult only pool, which honestly seemed boring compared to the main pool area. As far as dining options, we wish there were more. The poolside cafe is extremely limited, so you're better off going to the Bistro Molikini, which has a better menu. Both places are pretty average. The best food (and of course the most expensive) is at the Humuhumu. It was so great we went there twice. The shops area offers another cafe, but we did not try it. The gift shop is well equipped and you can buy some basics there like chips/soda/beer etc. I'm sure many people can come here for a week and never feel the need to leave! Wailea is probably the nicest area on Maui that we came across. No other city compared. You are a bit further away from some attractions in Maui, but its worth it for a true luxury experience. The staff is excellent, and i was impressed at how CLEAN everything was. At many hotels, i am scared to walk around barefoot in pool areas, but the staff here kept it spotless.

The room was quiet, it had plenty of light, and it was easily accessible from the (less busy) ballroom entrance on the side of the hotel. Regarding all of those fees, I have to say that I felt like I did get something extra for them. The housekeeping at this hotel was--hands down--the best that I've ever had while traveling. The housekeepers showed up twice a day (normal + turndown service), and they would exchange towels/empty trash/etc on both visits. We were also appreciative of the fact that the staff would actually attempt to pick up the room a little, instead of just changing the sheets. In addition, the valet parking was quick and efficient, and the parkers would always bring the car around with cold bottles of water waiting inside, along with a clean windshield. The pool area was great. I would never admit this in public, but water slides and lazy rivers never get old, even for adults.

The room we were given (Deluxe Garden category) was pretty dumpy. The sleeping area was an ok size for a king size bed, but was a bit small for two beds.

It was mostly clean except for a dead bug on the floor and some dusty spots in the corners, but it was also run down.

The hotel staff was supposed to call our cell phone when the room was ready so we headed to the pool. It was so crowded; talk about nowhere to sit and nowhere to go.

We couldn't find a single chair in the adult pool area or in the grassy area below that pool. We went to the regular pool and it is too crowded to even walk. They have the chairs placed with just a few inches between each along the entire pool and lazy river area. We headed to the beach. That was the only place to get a little room between us and the nearest neighbor. They never called about the room. I finally called at around 5:30 because we had a dinner event at the hotel at 6p. They told me when I called it was ready. Not sure when it was really ready since they never called. The views of the whales (we were there in early March) were the best part of the location of the hotel. The crowds at the pool were beyond annoying and were that way for the entire stay. This is not a review for parents. I think they would love this place for the sandy area for kids to play, waterfalls and waterslides for kids. For such a high star rating I would expect to be writing about the exceptional staff, knowing staff members name to refer to in this review, but I had not one experience that was above average. Felt like a \"number\" getting in line at a waterpark to get towels each day. Service from the pool bar was beyond long wait times - the average time the three times we ordered at the pool area was at least 40 minutes. The one food order took over an hour. You had to get at the pool at 8am to get a chair in the adult area and they always had people with towels across multiple chairs for hours at a time and no one sitting there. There was not a single experience at the Grand Wailea that made it worth the price per night or made it worth the annoyingly crowded resort and hotel. Oh wait. The gym was nice. Equipment was nice and clean. We have a convention at the Wailea every four years, but in four years, we are going to stay at one of the other hotels that are within walking distance of this property. Views will be similar but hopefully the crowds and overall experience will not. Select the Marriott next door or the four seasons. Not worth the money when you can spend that on excursions or great dinners.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGrand Wailea is the place to stay on Maui\u201d", "Author": "trvlgirl13", "ReviewID": "UR118023451", "Content": "Beautiful hotel -- we stayed in the Napua towers which entitled us to complimentary breakfast, snacks and cocktails.

And just a word about the spa -- amazing! If you can spare the time away from everything there is to do at the hotel, definitely take the time to book a spa appointment. The hydrotherapy room is one of the best I've seen, compares to Canyon Ranch. And the treatments are well done and priced in line with comparable spas, nothing too outrageous. The restaurants are very good but again a bit pricy. If you have a rental car and are willing to drive a bit, it's well worth the drive to Mama's Fish House or Hailemaile General Store for lunch or dinner.

Pros: - Plenty to do for the 5 yr old and 3 yr old. Swimming pool mostly appropriate for the most part, for them. I say mostly because there's only one (sand-floor pool) that's actually 100% appropriate. But if your kid can swim or doesnt mind hanging out with floaties for a large chunk of the time, pretty much all pools are appropriate. Shouting and craziness is a given at this hotel and the slides (most, anyway) are appropriate for the wussiest and the youngest, as well. - Food (namely lunch) appropriate for the younger ones as well. Pricey, but decent. - Rooms (standard ones) are spacious and plenty of space for us all. - Location - your'e within minutes drive of dozens or reasonably priced, good food. Definitely worth having a car. This is not a resort I would plan to stay at for all meals with younger kids. Not just the price (although it's extremely pricey onsite!) but also the selection of the food was not particularly up the kids' alley for dinner. Cons: - Lounging chairs were ridiculously scarce. We literally set up an alarm starting the 2nd day, to head to the pool and reserve a couple of spots - every day. And we'd stand in line starting 15 minutes before the \"chains\" opened and still we'd be 10th in line sometimes. Kinda ridiculous.. you'd think when you pay $600-700/night, you would be able to rely on a chair or two for a family of 5. Shaded chairs? Pff - virtually no chance at all. So few of them (we needed one with a newborn but there were others like us that did, too..) - Pricey food - Distances --the downside of the gorgeous endless manicured gardens is that you walk. A lot. If I needed a quick visit to our room for baby feeding or forgotten floaties, I'd be gone for 15-20 minutes just for back and forthing to the room. We stayed for 7 nights through a Costco package and had a blast. Would definitely go back again.

We checked in and it was fabulous and just as I had hoped considering the resort was a Waldorf property and all. It is GRAND, it is BEAUTIFUL and it could have been perfect in every concievable way THEN they began arriving. Little by little over our first three days things began to change and by day four all hell had broken loose. We were at the hotel at the same time as convention, a huge 800 room check in in one day convention as I soon learned. I am so sad to say our dream trip was soon turned into watching a re-run of my Spring Break trips to Cancun from my teenage years. This very beautiful and wonderful resort was taken over and I do mean completely taken over by hundreds of people that apparently don't need to abide by ANY rules either by the hotel or even worse by society. I tell you it was as if caged animals were let loose by the pool. This resort with these supposed strict pool rules of one hour saving policys nope, apparently the pool chair saving rule DID NOT apply to this group (only to regular guests) as I saw rows of chairs being held by only a stray towel here and there for HOURS sitting empty when other chairs being held by family type items were swooped up and taken away by the pool staff. The staff was just standing back and letting these people have free reign at the ENTIRE hotel. The pool, the gym, it was awful. You could not even walk around the pool area to escape because there were so many of these conventioneers cheering on the company volleyball games the entire area was blocked by drunken, swearing, whoo-hooing, yelling, screaming people. I was just waiting for the WET T SHIRT contest to start. It was honestly THAT bad. Even worse I did try to speak to someone anyone but NOBODY cared. I went to the front desk THREE times. I was actually crying the third time I was so frustrated. The response was I will speak to ther manager. I promise you I did not even get a phone call. NO RESPONSE FROM ANY MANAGER. Nobody cared. The front desk acted annoyed by me and couldn't have possibly cared any less. I didn't really expect anything but I was really expecting at least a telephone call from someone, ANYONE. I did encounter a person that cared and his name is Gilbert. Gilbert remembered me from my first day and addressed me by name and was completely wonderful and exactly what you would expect from a Waldorf property. I found three people at this resort that were actually wonderful and deserve to be mentioned here. First Gilbert at the front desk second Keo the beach chair guy and third Dan the 8th floor bartender. These three pepole were just as wonderful as can be everyone else from the frint desk to the pool to the concierge were far too busy with this horrid convention to bother with my little family. It is clear to me that quantity is more of the focus here than is quality. My one family didn't mean a thing to this management. Not when they had just filled 800 rooms with drunken covention attending guests. To not receive at least a phone call from management after three compliaints at the front desk and two at the pool is unforgiveable to me. The General Manager here is Matt Bailey. He is not doing the Waldorf Astoria name any favors by his turning a blind eye to the resort being taken over by a large group at the expense of his regular guests. Lots of people were as horrified as I was. It is my understanding that this group has the company convention at The Grand Wailea every year so call and check before you go. If you are told there will be a large convention DO NOT GO. Like I said before this place is all about quantity NOT quality. Three people that cared and were great. Three. So sad.

We loved the view the other room provided but appreciated the closer proximity to the pool in the Chapel wing because we have a small child. We also had another problem with the room because we had a native insect (lol) visit us in our room but they had quickly transfer us and even gave us an end room that was a little more spacious and had an additional side window with another fantastic view. It was a little bit of a walk to the main lobby and shops but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind. As for the pool, we loved it! The only negative was the guests. We had a very small child and kept getting water splashed right in his face. This is not uncommon in a pool, right? But this was at the baby beach area and most of the splashing was by ADULTS that just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. We just ended coming back at the less busy times, in the morning and late afternoon. Our favorite part was the lazy river, my husband me and the baby all had a good time. The maid service was so great!!! She was so nice and worked well around the babies sleep times. As for the food, it was not so great. We only ate at the Bistro, Dinning room and the inside area lobby bar but the food could have been better. The service as the breakfast buffet in the Dinning room was hit or miss. Some days we where told one thing and then the next day with another server the info was totally different. They need to have all the servers on the same page. However the service was great at the inside area lobby bar and even talked with Angie (the food and beverage manager) and expressed our concerns and the high points in our stay. She was extremely receptive and did a great job listening and providing feedback!!! As for the negatives the Spa was great until I got the massage. The women that I had just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to what I wanted and it was just not up to par for the over $200 price tag.

I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the printer to work to print off our boarding passes and it wasted over an hour of my time trying to fix the problem and waiting for the technical staff that after an hour NEVER showed.

This also caused problems at the airport and took us twice as long to check in :( Overall we would stay here again and feel free to email me with questions about this hotel.

Also, pay in full at the time of booking for a nice discount on the room but only if you are very positive that you are not going to need to cancel as you would not get a refund.

The grounds and hotel were just as beautiful and meticulously clean. But, the service this time, and the friendliness of the staff, was really top-notch. This hotel really does stand apart from the other hotels on the island, both in beauty and in service. This is a wonderful family hotel. Although upscale in design it is incredibly family friendly. Everything is impeccably clean. There are beautiful views in every direction. The landscaping is perfectly designed - photo ops abound. The pools are a huge draw for kids of all ages. And, the beach is beautiful with a view of Molokini crater and a lovely paved beach walk which meanders by some other resorts, often with views of green sea turtles just off the reef. Some folks will complain about the mandatory daily valet charge on top of the daily resort fee. And, while I agree that the cost is yet one more daily fee added to an already expensive hotel; they really add some nice touches that make it worth having. * The car was always ready when we needed it and we were always greeted kindly both when picking up the car and when dropping it off. * There were always cold water bottles, for each member of the party, provided by the valets each time they picked up your car * They always offered beach towels, for each member of the party, if you needed them. We were pleasantly surprised that a small complementary fridge was now included in the daily resort fee for guest use. It was plenty large enough to store some water bottles, yogurt, fruit and lunch meat; which can really save a family money over the course of a week. There are affordable food stores nearby as well (Foodland and Safeway) and even a Whole Foods in Kahului, near the airport. We had a chance to dine at Humu's on two separate evenings, once in the dining room area with our large party of eight and once in the bar area with a smaller party of four. Both meals were exceptional - both the food and the service. The wait staff was perfectly friendly and attentive. I can honestly say that they were our favorite meals on the island. We also had a chance to visit the spa and salon. The treatments and therapists there were wonderful and we really enjoyed the changes made in the hydrotherapy rooms and salon, since our last stay. There are five pools in the spa that feature indigenous ingredients from some of the islands and you can choose one of the baths to use in your pedicure. Nice touch!

Hotel is overcrowded and in need of an update.\u201d", "Author": "spdma", "ReviewID": "UR117027371", "Content": "Just returned from 6 nights at the Grand Wailea and was VERY DISAPPOINTED. This was supposed to be the pinnacle of our 3 Island trip and we had just checked out of the Hyatt on Poipu Bay in Kauai (which was absolutely fantastic) so we had high expectations. Upon arrival we went to the pool as our room wasn't ready. We could not find two adjacent chairs, let alone four for our family. The facility was overrun with guests and we ended up sitting on the lawn area as it was the only space available. The chairs in the pool area are crammed together, side by side, much like you'd find on the deck of a cruise ship. What we later learned is this hotel sells facility/pool access to an adjacent time share property. It appears they have little regard for registered guests and they are out for profit maximization as they do not have the physical space to support the hundreds of extra visitors that purchase pool passes. I shared this opinion with the front desk and the hotel waived the mandatory daily activity fee for our entire stay - the staff said they were familiar with this problem and apologized. I think this frustrated me even more as they are well aware the overcrowding is an ongoing problem. Also, we were less than pleased with the condition of our room. There was a signifcant amount of black mold in the grout lines of our bathtub & shower unit. Three days went by before we were notified that problem couldn't be fixed by housekeeping as engineering needed to get involved - the mold had penetrated the silicone caulking - probably more info here than you care to know, but this is supposed to be a 5 Star Hotel. In addition the room was noisier than expected as we could routinely hear staff going down the hallway, especially the bellman's cart, and occassionally could hear the guests in the adjacent rooms. It is really unfortunate as this is a beautiful property which seems to be falling into neglect. I came to this conclusion whenI was looking at the condition of the pool which had many missing tiles, the condition of some of the fountains which needed cleaning/repair, and the dated colors throughout the hotel- which could use a good overall painting. When we spoke with some of the staff, which were very good, they told us the property has changed hands a few times over the past several years....it appears this lack of continuity may be responsible for the compromised condition of this Hotel.

The grounds are phenomenal, the rooms are gorgeous and the staff is helpful and will do just about anything for their guests. The pools are spectacular. This resort is just about perfect. My family (2 kids ages 6 and 9) had a great time. However, perfection comes with a price. A standard mixed drink at the pool and lobby bar was $14.00. Regardless of price, if you are hanging out at the pool and use the slides from pool to pool, one should invest in the cool plastic Pineapple container for your drinks ($21.00 initially and $14.00 for cocktail refills). It has a handy sealed lid to keep your drink somewhat safe as you slide from pool to pool or if you drink too much. Once you get home, the pineapple doubles as a piggybank for the kids or your next trip back to the Grand Wailea. The Spa Grande is one of the nicest spas I have ever been to. The Terme baths are unique! Here's the stuff you may or may not care to know: The daily resort fee was $20.00 plus valet parking is mandatory at the resort at an additional $25.00 per day...not to mention every time you want your car, you have to fork over more money for a tip for the valet. Our room contained a king size bed and a pull out couch for the kids. The first night we had to put sheets on the pull out couch. Fortunately, the sheets and blanket were neatly sealed in a box in the closet. I am not super high maintenance but it would have been nice for the staff to recognize our reservation would be using the pull out couch and prepared accordingly for our arrival. The bed for my husband and I was super comfortable and we slept well but the mattress topper had obviously hills and valleys in it which to me indicates wear. Again, I am not the type who is going to demand for my bed to be ergonomically redesigned for my liking on vacation, so I just dealt with it. Other than my small complaints, The Grand Wailea is awesome. The Grand is not necessarily for those who are frugal like myself.

We arrived late and our rooms were ready and our childen enjoyed the lei greeting. The rooms were spacious, and kept clean, with no maintenance issues whatsoever.

We were not in the Napua Tower and honestly didn't miss its amenities. The dining room food for breakfast was excellent - though I wished they opened at 6 instead of 7 -- something about Hawaii made us awake each day at 5:30 or so. Bistro Molokini was okay, though a pricey lunch option. Cafe Kula left something to be desired--across the board the staff working the morning shift was grumpy and unhelpful. The pool chairs thing IS a drag, but with a pool that amazing you can see why people line up to get their place in the shade. Our last day my husband rented a cabana -- we've also decided this will be an annual tradiiton to end vacations in style. The extra chairs, extra shade and extra service were absolutely worth the price, especially given the size of our group. Snorkeling right off the beach at the hotel was great - as was kayaking, paddleboarding, boogie boarding and just plain beach time. The sand was the nicest I have ever had at a hotel. Soft, even on the floor of the ocean. The package rentals from the beach are great - especially since you can decide what you want to do whenever, and aren't locked into hauling around the gear.

The balcony area was big and very nice and the bathroom were very big and recently renovated. The room itself was a bit dated with older carpet and tiles. The bed was very comfortable.

They do provide 2 bottles of water each time they get the car. This resort, however, is worth every penny because of the amazing grounds with art and sculptures and the MAGNIFICENT pools. The pools are quite elaborate with one pool leading to another and connected by slides. Also had whitewater currents leading to the lazy river. Water elevator was neat.

I had high expectations for this place based on reviews and reputation but was poorly disappointed from the moment I checked in. The staff: The front desk staff were rude upon check in and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even provide directions to the room which felt like it was a mile from the entrance. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until the last day I was told I could valet park at the convention center for easier access to the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The rooms: The first night of sleep was interrupted by a bed that smelled like the previous guest had sweated out the bedding. Also, the air conditioning was pumping out a damp mildew smell. The overall condition of the room was poor and run down. The bathroom tiles were moldy and there was hair all over the place. I asked for a new room and was treated as if I was inconveniencing the hotel. I never received an apology and had to wait hours for a new room. On day 2, I found an enormous cockroach in my shoes that I had placed in the closet!!! GROSS!!!! Yes, I expect roaches in Hawaii, but NOT at a Waldorf Astoria Resort. Again, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive any apologies. The front desk said cockroaches were something they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control and offered to have the room sprayed for bugs. After the room was sprayed, I found 2 more roaches\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Pool: This place felt like a low end Disneyland Resort. The pool was over crowded, there are kids running/screaming everywhere, there are more guests than pool chairs to go around, the pool bathrooms smelled like sewage, and if you want anyone to help you find a chair at the beach you have to have cash ready to tip. Otherwise you can rent cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for $500 a day. The cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of course sit vacant and the lounges are never released for people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a place to sit at the pool. The staff do not follow up on there \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one hour chair policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at all. The Parking: The only parking option is valet at $25 a day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the cost that is an issue it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the inconvenience of not being able to easily get your car when you need it. The valets are overworked and it takes like 20 minutes to get your car. The Food: I expected the food to be expensive but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to taste so bad. The food was like something from a junior high cafeteria. Your best bet is to eat at local establishments like Merrimans, Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and MonkeyPod. Even the sandwich I got at Subway was better than the food I ordered from Grand Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room service. Fitness Center: This is the only redeeming quality of the entire resort. There was plenty of equipment and lots of if! Bottom Line: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to the 5 star reviews. Take your money to either the Grand Hyatt in Kaanapali or the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua.

We did the rental to avoid the headache after reading the reviews. If you decide to do the rental, I would recommend doing it ahead of time as they rent out quickly.

The drive from Kahului airport to Wailea was a familiar site -- and breeze with the added lanes on both sides of the main highway. Pulling up to the hotel, I was delighted to see the bougainvillea and the tropical trees still lining the main entrance. But if it wasn't for the stationary, I probably wouldn't have noticed that the hotel is now a part of the Waldorf Astoria family. I had to flag down a bellman to assist with my luggage. I guess I looked like the type to carry my own bags. The doorman offered me a valet ticket -- and asked if I was staying or just visiting. I thought the two were one and the same, so I said, \"Yes.\" He then clarified his question to be, \"Are you just having lunch?\" I replied that I was staying for a few days. I asked about self parking and was informed that the hotel no longer offers self parking. All cars are parked by a valet -- whether you enter the main entrance or the group entrance. Interesting, I thought: No options. The front desk was busy as expected, but the agent made me feel welcome and greeted me with a warm smile and a cheerful \"aloha!\" Within minutes, I was given my room key and was pointed in the right direction. As I had stayed at the hotel before, I knew my way around and was aware that certain rooms were farther away from the lobby than others. Then again, not everyone is heading to the lobby in the morning -- so farther away isn't always a bad thing. The staff will offer you a map -- not that you can change your room at any given time. But at least you'll have an idea how far away you are from the restaurants and pools. My room was techinically in the Molokini wing. Some of the rooms there are frightful. You can be in a mountain category and actually looking out at the group entrance. Depending on who's staying at the hotel (i.e. a large convention), the noise from the buses at all hours can be annoying. But I was lucky and had a room facing the garden area within the hotel. My room wasn't too far from the elevators -- which was a good choice on a business trip. If I was on a romantic getaway, I would definitely request something away from the elevators. People tend to chat alot when they stand in front of the elevators. Don't know why. I think they might be talking about the weather (and how beautiful Maui is!). The room had two full beds, was adequate in size, and was clean. There was a balcony/lanai -- but everyone from the Cafe Kula would look at me whenever I went outside. I didn't utilize room service -- which I told took awhile. I dined at Cafe Kula almost every morning -- mainly because of its close proximity to my room. For dinner and lunch, I dined off property. The pool and the Spa were my two favorite places to run off to. The slides at the pool are too much fun. There are different slides in different parts of the pool. Some for little kids, some for big kids. But definitely a fun place to be. The Spa speaks for itself. One of the best worldwide. I did have time to head out to the beach one day.

The gym is great - it has everything you could want, although it be nice if there was a view of something (other then the basement.) The downside for me is that this resort has lost some of it's glory over the last ten years - I think the recession has had an impact. The corridors are showing a lot of wear and tear, and the rooms definitely need some TLC. (There were nicks in the paint all over the room, the bathroom had chips in the tile, etc.) It just is starting to look old. For a place that will charge you $20 for a poolside cocktail and $500-$700 a night for a room, I expect a little more.

On the counter they have fresh fruit that is chilled. We got a complimentary upgrade,to a high floor. Then the bell hop told us how to get to the beach, pool, back to the lobby, concierge, etc. The bell hop walks you to your room! We stayed in the deluxe ocean front on the 8th floor and the view was breath taking. The shower is glass, big tub, nice rug under the sink, a mini room with a door and phone for the toilet, and a large sink space. The carpet is clean and the sheets are as white as fresh fallen snow. You have a large deck...and I'm pretty sure everybody has a large deck because you can see all the towers from the beach/pool. The maid gave us extra towels (by request), because they don't give you a lot of towels. The pool is amazing, which includes a lazy river, water falls, slides, a volleyball net, a hot tub, and the worlds only water elevator! The beach is the best part. With pure white sand, lots of umbrellas and chairs, and clear turquoise water. The water is nice, but can get very wavy so be careful. I recommend getting a tube or raft because it's relaxing. We kayaked and the sights were beautiful. We rented a car and had an ant problem on the road to Hana, but had all $230 COMPED! When we rented one a second time, they said they had inspected it and no ants. Also, when we picked up our second rental, we did not see that car there. The hotel is beautiful and outdoors, which makes it that much better. The staff is friendly and service is great. It's a very clean hotel and we actully saw the janitor vacuuming the light and cleaning the elevator buttons! The breakfast buffet was fresh and we looked for it everyday. Somedays, when we wanted breakfast my husband went down to cafe' kula and brought back muffins, croissants, coffees, cereal, etc. The food is amazing. Our favorite resturaunts there was Bistro Molokini and Humahumanukanukaapuwa'a. I would suggest doing the road to Hana-only if you don't get car sick, a helicopter ride, and black sand beaches, waterfalls, etc. We were so sad to leave, even after 14 days.

Humu, with the $40 coupons was a fairly reasonable value and a great atmosphere. We had 3 rooms so we had $120 worth of coupons. Our dinner for 6, after coupons, was just over $200! This included some apps and drinks. Don't drink as much as us and use your free drink coupons with dinner, not before, and it is even less! We all felt it very good.

My husband had moved this belongings to a poolside chair around 3 pm, folded his shirt, Maui (something) sunglasses, ocean equipment rental pass & room key along with a tee shirt & went into the pool for 20 minutes. When he came out, all was gone. They had left his flip flops & our son's belongings on the chair next door. My husband was frantic. We went to the towel desk. The clerk looked at a chart & told us no pool towel collection had occurred, goodbye. We insisted she ask the towel girl. She called over the towel girl & the very first thing the girl did when asked about our lost items was smirk & deny collecting any towels or belongings. The desk clerk called security at our request & two guys arrived. My husband was quite sure they'd either been stolen or removed by the pool towel person. My husband said then they were stolen. Security said no. I went to the woman sitting next to us & thank heavens, she recalled in great detail that a towel girl had removed my husband's stuff, it bothered her so she noted it, thought it was odd & let it go until we asked her. Security again said not possible, don't get upset, mellow out, this is Hawaii, goodbye. My husband asked if either of them were working today, would they take the time to talk to the woman & they refused. I went to the woman, she went to the security guys, identified exactly who had removed the items - the smirking girl. Then they went through the towels & discovered the items rather carefully placed in the bottom of the towel hamper. Apparently the Maui sunglasses are rather prized over there. There was no apology, just a \"oh here they are - funny thing that!\" & we were sent on our way feeling very unhappy about the experience. I had been planning a big family reunion for next summer in HI & due to this, I will not be suggesting this property as one where we should stay.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNegative Reviewers are Wrong about this Resort\u201d", "Author": "KnicksFanHou", "ReviewID": "UR114694860", "Content": "We agonized about staying either here or the Westin in Lahaina, after looking at all the information we decided the Grand Wailea would do the trick. We came here on the second part of our Hawaii trip, the first of which was at Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu which we have already reviewed. The Grand Wailea exceeded all expections and the few most common complaints I read on trip advisor were dead wrong. Debunking Myths: The Pools Close at 10pm not 5pm. The water slides and pools used in the fantastic water slide system close at 5pm however you still have access to the normal pools until 10pm. I am not sure where all these people that say the pools close at 5pm got there information from, this is just totally wrong. The pools in fact were amazing and the waterslides fun for all ages. The property is lovely well maintained with great gardens that you can spend evenigns walking through and taking. There are so many different plants and the sound of the ocean especially at night makes for such a romatic setting. The beach front seems private because generally only hotel guests are making use of it and the service was always prompt and attentive. The rooms were large and spacious with huge bathrooms. Separate shower and tub and toilet room made it feel like home. The balcony facing the gardens and the ocean in the distance created serenity. The bed was comfortable and sleeping at night with the balcony open was wonderfull. The food though expensive was mostly good, however, with a rental car you have many great food options on Kihei, such as Wok Star. The Safeway nearby is great but there is also a Foodland and Times Mart and CVS (Longs Drugs is the trade name, but rest assured it is CVS) are also very close in Kihei the availability of all these stores made the overpriced food not so much of an issue. Kihei Cafe had great French Toast for all the breakfast lovers out there. The one negative that I will agree with is the Valet Parking was overpriced and not worth the service. They have ample parking and should have allowed self park for a nominal fee with optional valet parking. All in all I loved Grand Wailea and Maui and found this resort hotel to meet every expectaton plus, I will stay here again, just for the pools and slides!", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "Princesita06", "ReviewID": "UR114676025", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Wailea from May 22 to the 28th.

Humus restaurant in the resort is AMAZING...if you go between 5-6pm you can get a 2lb lobster for half price....the best lobster I ever had! Lamb and fish also amazing. Bistro Molokini is also very good for lunch and drinks. The poolside restaurant is ok... We got the plastic pineapples to drink out of which saved us a lot of $$! You pay more when you buy them but every time you order a drink they fill the pineapple so you get double the amount of drink for the same price as a regular drink. The shops in the hotel are very cute but some are $$. Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is at the Shops at Wailea (next door to hotel) and is AMAZING! If you like steak and seafood it's a must. Overall the rooms are super clean. We were upgraded to the Napua Tower which is a gated area with extra services. The pools are out of this world! Huge lazy river and also an adults-only pool. Mama's Fish House is a MUST in Maui!! Save room for the lilikoi creme brulee! If you rent a car, you have to pay valet which is 20$ a day, but the valet is excellent and they give you cold water bottles every time! Overall outstanding resort!

It's also expensive without a doubt. If you were to go to a resort and not planning on really leaving, this would be a good place. The large water park area is a lot of fun and great for playing or relaxing. They have multiple little water slides and a water elevator (must do once). Lazy type river and a side that actually is sand / pool combo. Great for kids. If you want to do things around the Island or do any excursions, I would recommend staying in Lahaina where there are more shops, restaurants and all of the docks for the excursions are. We drove to Lahaina three times and it's 40 minutes each way. We put 600 miles on the car driving around to the different sites and areas over 6 days. I believe the parking is mandatory valet at $25/day. You do get two fresh cold bottles of water in your car everytime you pick it up. The rooms were nice - nothing fancy. The beds were way too soft and after laying in them a bit you start to sink into pits and wake up with sore backs. I loved how they had ice water in dispensers throughout the property and pool area and at the front desk they had a guava pineapple juice set up complimentary. (it went great with my vanilla vodka I had!) Drinks at the pool and bars are minimum $14. Get the plastic pineapple upgrade for $21 then the refills after that are $14 but it appears you get a bigger drink. The restaurants were all good that we experienced. Ate at Huma Huma one night - good food and about $50/person (without drinks). The restaurant at the main dining area was good - we didn't try the buffett. And for quick snacks they had a cafe that was pretty good. The boardwalk along the beach is great and goes on for quite a ways. The beach itself is very nice and you can get the umbrellas and chairs without extra $$. There is a mandatory $20 a day resort fee as well for what I'm not sure. Internet and access to gym? It seems that after paying $600 a night they wouldn't nickel and dime you. For Hilton members....you don't get much in priviledges here. We are diamond members and we did get a late check out at 4:00 and were given a coupon for a restaurant and drinks. they didn't give them to us when we checked in and I had to ask about it a few days later. We also got to check in about 1:00 and got a room upgrade to ocean view. Don't expect the normal free breakfasts! Housekeeping was good and replaced everything whether we needed it or not and the soaps and shampoos are actually really good! We would get ice every day ourselves and housekeeping would dump it out when they came and cleaned but not ever actually fill it up. Until the last day they finally figured it out. (and we tipped her every day even). Staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved that the whole hotel is outdoors and natural air. The rooms themselves didn't really seem to get really cold but it was okay. Beautiful flowers and plants everywhere and the maintenance crews are out in full force making the property sparkle. I probably wouldn't choose to stay here again simply due to the cost and location of the property but it is pretty!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME VACATION!\u201d", "Author": "KAJ2947", "ReviewID": "UR114644136", "Content": "We recently visited the Grand Wailea on June 9th for 5 nights.

We very much enjoyed our vacation and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave. The hotel room and grounds were absolutely wonderful. The pool and ocean were the best! We did meet one wonderful person on the staff at the Grand Wailea that went above and beyond. Rose, the lei greeter was simply wonderful from day one welcoming us with a smile (and lei) and making my daughter feel special each time we saw her. My daughter formed a wonderful bond with this very nice woman and wants to go back just to see Rose. Thank you Rose for all you did to make our trip the best it could be! My only complaint during our stay was the recent change to mandatory valet parking. This fee is outrageous at $25/day, plus on the ticket they give you it states the daily fee does not include gratuity. First of all, I personally like the exercise of getting my own car and the Grand Wailea has two large parking garages, so space doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to be a shortage. Second, most people only take their car out once, at most two times a day. We personally did only take our car out one time per day during our stay, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $30-35 to move the car one time. I feel you should give people the choice, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are plenty of people who demand this type of service, but not make it mandatory for those who do not want to participate.

The Grand Wailea should be considered one of the greatest family resorts in the world. I've hit fifteen countries, stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms, but something about this place...it's more than a hotel. It's a world of comfort, excitement, and pleasure. Everything you could ever ask for can be found within the grounds, or a short walk, from your room. I've stayed here twice, both times renting enormous 2-bedroom suites. Both had butler's entrances, so when you order breakfast in bed, they quite literally make the final prep right there in your kitchen. There's so much to be said about this resort, it's nearly impossible to articulate. I went SCUBA diving, snorkeling, surfing, golfing, had countless drinks at the swim-up bar, used the world's only water elevator, rubbed elbows with some celebs, joined the fun of a Luau, and explored the multitude of pools. This place will honestly impress the best travelled souls. I'll stress the family angle, as it's fun for everyone, and travelled families know it. While there are areas designated \"Adults Only\" the family aspect is all around. I've stayed next door, as well, but The Grand Wailea is still my preference.

The location is wonderful and the ocean walkway was lovely to explore the coastline outside the hotel. The Four Seasons next door looks a bit more refined, but again, this was a business trip so there was no option. The Wailea area of Maui is beautiful and appears to be one of the nicer resort areas on the island (from what I've read), although it is relatively far from Lahaina and some of the other hotel areas such as Ka'anapali. The grounds are lovely and the food is good. I think Humuhumu is a little overrated but it all depends what you are used to and what your tastes are. Customer service all around was stellar. As for \"complaints\": The walkways outside the rooms are tile and that makes for some noise when luggage is being brought up or down but I suppose that's a small complaint in an otherwise lovely property. Bathroom was spacious, bed was comfortable and the linens were clean. It wasn't as high-end as I expected from Waldorf Astoria, but on the other hand, I appreciated the lower key experience. If I was traveling on my own dime I might not stay there as I could see that if it were filled to capacity it would be akin to a \"cruise on land\" with lots of groups and kids. It is not a secluded, intimate resort so keep that in mind if you are looking for a more quiet, upscale hotel experience.

We started going there in 2004, and coming all the way from the east coast it is quite a hike. This hotel however is worth it. The minute you step into the lobby the stuning views hit you. The lobby has a brezzy ocean view with beautiful sculptures. I have been to this hotel 5 times so far and I have had very different experiences with check in. I am a hilton honors member, which allows me to go in a different line. However this has not been the case for all of my visits. The line can be 30 min long, but the staff does everything to make it a better experiece. They take your bags when you arrive and you don't have to worry about them they will show up in your room. This helps but my greatest advice is go at an off time for check in, or hurry to the hotel after your flight came in. Chances are a few of those people are also headed to the Grand. Once you check in if you have kids go staight to the pools, believe me kids never get sick of the pools. Things you must do include going to SPA grande it is truely amazing. As far as restraunts go I always go to humu for the atmoshpere. The best food is probably at the four seasons next door (very short walk) I would suggest Spago (wolfgang puck's resturant) or Ferraros (outside). Both are amazing at sunset is the best tiotime to go. Overall one of my favorite hotels in the world. My only reservations are that everytime I visit this time my family has a hard time leaving, so if you want to explore the island not just lay by the pool pick a less awsome hotel.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel - Great for family - NO COMPLAINTS\u201d", "Author": "Danield528", "ReviewID": "UR110827635", "Content": "This was our first trip to Maui. We are 2 adults (35) and 3 kids (9, 6 and 2). We arrived at 9:30PM and were greeted by the valet/bellmen with flower leis and warm welcome. CAt check-in, we did not have to wait at all. We were escorted to our room and given a tour. Our room was on the first floor of the lagoon wing, at the very end, It was a long walk to the lobby, but right outside our door were the pools and the ocean. We found this room location to be awesome and would take it again a hundred times over. When we booked this trip, in November 2010, there was still self-parking available for free. When we checked in, we were told that everything was now valet only and that it was $25 a day. I told them that it wasn't like that when we booked the trip and she immediately told us it would be comped for the duration of our stay. (I didn't even complain just merely mentioned that it was news to us). Awesome. The room was modern, comfortable, spacious and clean. The view from the huge balcony was awesome. We looked at the beach and the pools. There were plenty of outlets and the high speed internet (wired and wireless) worked well. We ate almost all of our breakfasts at the Kihei Caffe (I reviewed it, too) which was a fantastic local spot about ten minutes from the hotel. For all 5 of us, it was about $30-$35. (My wife and 2 daughters ate one breakfast at the hotel for $50+ and said it was so-so.) The pools were incredible. The beach was beautiful. We never had to \"fight\" for a chair or spot on the beach. When we came down at 7am, there was no one there. Even when we came down later, like 9 or 10, there was always a place to throw down our stuff. We don't sit in the chairs anyway, just need a place to lay our things. No problem there. Pools and pool area were always clean and well staffed. The grounds at this place, starting in the lobby and all throughout are just beautiful. I travel a lot and have never had this level of service at any hotel I've stayed at. As for the complaints about nickel and dime charges, this is a five-star hotel and you can expect things to cost more than other hotels. For example, we got 4 frozen drinks at the pool (3 without alcohol) and it was $45. Again, you have to expect this at a place of this caliber. You also don't get any riff-raff at the hotel - We met a lot of nice people at the pools, beach and the lu'au. About the lu'au...It is expensive. All 5 of us went, and we ponied up the extra $ for premium seats which got us front row/center table. It was a neat show and the kids loved it. Live music, open bar, hula dancers, big buffet, entertainment for the kids, temporary tattoos, Hawaiian horseshoes, crafts vendors etc. The food was adequate, not exceptional, but not bad at all. For the 5 of us, it was $440, like I said - expensive. We figured it was one of those things you have to do your first time in Hawaii. The gym is clean and has treadmills, dumbbells, nautilus-type machines, a Smith machine, high ceilings, and other miscellaneous fad exercise gadgets.

My wife and I also spent our honeymoon at the Grand Wailea three years ago. We really enjoyed our return trip to the Grand Wailea. Obviously there were some problems (as there are with any major vacation), but overall we had a great 7-night stay at the Grand Wailea. Our room was on the chapel wing, which was great (very quiet and convenient access to all of the hotel's amenities). The room was just a garden view, but it was a really nice view with a partial view of the ocean. I forgot just how gorgeous the grounds are. It's truly a beautiful hotel. The pools are amazing, while the beach is also great. I preferred the activities pool with the slides and the swim-up bar, while my wife enjoyed the beach and the adult pool. I used the fitness center and the walking/jogging trail for workouts while my wife really enjoyed the Spa Grande, although she said it was quite pricey. The food at the hotel wasn't great and was expensive, but we already knew this coming in. We bought granola bars and cereal bars for breakfast at K-Mart, an idea I highly recommend, as the breakfast at the hotel is really expensive. If we ate lunch at the hotel, my wife and I shared meals, as the portions are sizeable. Our dinner at Humu was enjoyable in a very unique, relaxed setting. I would recommend eating there. I would also suggest bringing in your own water/sodas, as our room had an empty refrigerator that you could stock with your own drinks. The room is quite nice, deserving of a 4 or possibly 4.5 star rating. My only complaints were the shower and the air conditioner. The shower had some mildew and the drain wasn't working properly. If you leave the air conditioner on automatic, it turns on and off every minute or so, which can wake you up periodically during the night. If you switch the air conditioner to fan it will blow constantly and will not bother you at all. We learned that the hard way the first night. Overall these problems weren't huge and the room was really nice. The staff is friendly and accomodating and quickly brought us whatever we requested (toothpaste, extra soap, towels, etc.). Richard, the bartender at the swim-up bar is a really nice guy. The conceirge was also very helpful with dinner reservations. In summary, the hotel is a beautiful resort with a great beach and the best pool(s) on Maui. The rooms are good but did have some flaws. The food is hit and miss but to be expected at a hotel.

We booked using Hilton Honors points which only guarantees the most basic room. At check-in we were upgraded to an ocean view room in the lagoon tower. We liked the location as it was closest to the beach, pool and restaurants. The room was large with a very big bathroom and nice sized lanai. There was some visible wear and tear but everything was very clean during our stay. You could see the ocean so I guess that qualifies as ocean view, but it was over the pool complex and through a maze of palm tree.

We ate at Humu one night and it was very good. It was pricey but consistent with other high end restaurants in Wailea. Unfortunately Bistro Molokini was closed for dinner during our entire stay. This is the pool restaurant/casual dinner option. The menu looked good and less expensive than Humu. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 was a complete ripoff so we never ate a full meal there but the quality of the baked goods and such was unimpressive.

Restaurants: I believe there are two nice restaurants on the property (Seafood/Steak place and a Japanese place), as well as a bistro (service not so good).

We wanted to view the grand suite (nicest suite and $12k a night), they said there is someone in it right now but to call back on Friday (it was on Sunday we asked about it). Sure enough, we called back and they took us up there to show us. Valet and bartenders try to remember your name, and pool side service is pretty good.

The hotel was very beautiful and the rooms were quite spacious and nice. The hotel is massive, I think they said 850 rooms. Positives: - The pool was great, loved the river, tarzan rope, waterslides and waterfalls. Nice being able to grab a new towel whenever you need one. Bring tubes for floating around the \"river\", we spent hours doing this and it was great fun. - Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. - The beach is nice but can get a bit busy depending on how busy the hotel, and surrounding hotels are. - The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had one bad experience with one of the valet guys barking at my wife for not parking the car in the correct place but everyone else was great. - The chairs and table outside on the deck are fantastic, very nice for watching the sunset and having a drink. - The juice in the lobby was excellent, it usually showed up around check-in time, very good! - Courtesy rooms. We had a late flight and checkout was 12:00, we spent the day at the pool and then used one of their courtesy rooms which is a full size hotel room which you can use complimentary for 45 mins. This was a huge help and very nice to be able to have your own room to shower and get ready. Negatives: - The hotel size can be a negative, we were on the back wing and it was a pretty decent walk to and from the pool or beach, between 5 and 10 minutes walk I would say. I don't know if there is a difference in the rooms but you could ask for a room in one of the front wings. - Mandetory valet, I would rather just get my own car rather than having to go valet all the time. At times it can be a relatively long wait. I am just not really a valet person so I like the option of self parking. - A good portion of the guests! Certainly not the hotel's fault directly but it was a negative on our trip overall, we are not painting all guess with one brush but we found that many of the guests were quite rude and pretentious. I also hate it when people go down to the pool at 7 am and place towels on the pool chairs and don't come back down until it's 11:00. The hotel wasn't too busy when we were there and I was up early as it was so it wasn't too big of a deal but it's just sucks when you come down and all the good spots are taken yet nobody is there. There are signs that the hotel will move peoples stuff but maybe that's only during busy times like Christmas or Spring Break because we didn't see it happen. We had better luck getting good chairs at the regular pool over the adult pool, we usually ended up sitting behind the \"river\" closest to the beach which seemed to be a good spot. - No Versus!! I am Canadian and I love hockey, I was there for the playoffs and the hotel didn't have Versus on their cable network which was a major pain, we ended up going to Moose McGillycuddys which is the unofficial home for Vancouverites to watch hockey games, definitely go there for Taco Tuesday, awesome! Overall we definitely enjoyed our stay, the staff with one exception was great and the rooms were very nice. Food prices weren't too bad but I thought that the drink prices were a bit much, although not too much more than you would pay at a Fairmont or Four Seasons. The hotel had a good deal on snorkel and stand-up padel boarding, $99 for unlimited use. Stand up, was lots of fun and I would highly recommend. We liked Wailea and being walking distance to the shops, we have stayed in Kihei and Kaanapali also.

We have been to many exceptional resorts including in French Polynesia and we both thought the Grand Wailea was just spectacular from the minute we arrived. We pretty much jumped right out of the car, tossed the keys to the valet, checked in without any wait with an outstanding front desk agent and were taken to a beautiful \"garden view\" room with an exceptional ocean view. Since it was our anniversary our room had been decorated with tropical flowers all over the bed and through the bathroom and a jacuzzi tub all ready to go with floating flower pedals - we were both in awe to find this waiting for us. The grounds of the resort are masterfully planned and about as beautiful as could be everywhere we went. The gym, spa, and pool areas were stunning as well all featuring everything one could possibly want. I would particularly recommend the spa which is ranked among the best in the world with a massive array of hydrotherapy for use before and after any spa treatment. Ask for a 298 dollar couples package including two massages, lunch at the resort, and valet parking for out of resort guests. I would also recommend dining at Humu's as well - the food and ambiance were truly amazing. Overall the only negative thing i have to say about this place is that the business center should not charge an arm and a leg to access the Internet and print something other than a boarding pass. Do plan on spending a significant sum of money if you plan to stay here or anywhere else in Wailea - definitely pricey but worth it for a special occasion. If it's a special occasion such as an anniversary let the hotel know in advance - as I mentioned before they decorated our room really nice but also gave us a whole bunch of other things like a free bottle of champagne and free entree at Humu's plus some free drinks. We walked over to the Four Seasons and Fairmont and had dinner and drinks at each but we both agreed that the Grand Wailea was an overall better choice in terms of resort amenties, spa, and dining choices although we could not speak to the quality of the rooms and service in comparison.

The grounds and rooms at the Grand Wailea were nice, and the pools are all amazing, which explains the fact that it was quite crowded with families soaking up the sun and fun. I don't mind a busy place and definitely felt like if we had our kids with us it would have been a great fit for us in that way so people should know that. Their Spa Grande was a unique and delightful experience for me. I had the Signature Treatment - when I normally always get a Deep Tissue- and this still fit the bill for me, which can be tough. The bathing tubs in the main room and varying hot/cold tubs were a novelty which I really enjoyed as well. I would highly recommend the Spa to anyone staying in the vicinity of this place, actually, for a day visit as it was wonderful. I should not however, my husband felt differently. His primary complaint was that his treatment room was well-lit, with open windows- through which he could hear all the kids screaming at the pool outside. He didn't like that. My room was well lit but I only heard birds chirping. My one, big, issue was with service. When I'm staying at a nice place, paying nice-place rates- I want to feel like the staff cares, and I distinctly did not get that feeling at this hotel. The first day our flight landed early (which I think is common) so we asked the bellhop if we could leave our laptop bag with them while we wandered the grounds and ate lunch. She conceded but was clearly put-out by our request. That struck me as odd. We then proceeded to Bar Molikini for lunch where we waited...to be seen by the hostess, seated, to meet a waiter, to get food,... I chalked it up to being hungry and grumpy and ordered a glass of champagne with-instead of OJ- a splash of mango juice. The waiter acted like I was weird and I later received- just champagne. I drank it because hey, I like champagne. But that was odd to me too. Again, I chalked this all up to timing and me. The next day after lounging on the beach all morning we were starving yet again so we walked to the conveniently located Bar Molokini where we waited...for everything...all over again. I was so disappointed (and frustrated to be honest) that after 20 minutes of waiting I asked the hostess if any waiter knew we existed and she just pointed at a guy and said, \"Yeah- he's right there\", like it's my job to figure this out? I said \"Well right there is not right at my table, where I'd like him to be.\" I went back to the table and sat for a few minutes again. Finally I got up to leave and of course my apparent 'server' approached me and I said \"We're leaving\" to which he brightly answered \"Great!\" Indeed. Later that afternoon once I had calmed down, and of course happily eaten and been served off the property at Longhi's- which deserves it's own great review- for $25 instead of the $92 Molokini had cost me the day prior, I shared my experience with the Hotel Manager. He kindly listened to me and then said \"Thanks for sharing!\" SO yeah- he blew me off. I guess I would too if my place was crowded with people willing to receive bad service so their kids could enjoy an awesome pool. I get it, really. But as far as I'm concerned, there are too many high end resorts in Hawaii with amazing locations to waste your hard-earned money on a place that doesn't expend the effort to show they care, even a little.

It is a absolutely beautiful hotel. From the greeting by the friendly valet and lovely orchid lei, we were happy to have arrived at in our final island. We are Diamond HHonors and used points for our stay. We opted to upgrade for $150/night, which gave us an amazing oceanview room overlooking the chapel. Ryan, the bellman who brought our bags up was very friendly and helped us with the layout of the hotel. Our room was very large with sliding glass doors to the full length balcony. The bath was a good size with glass shower, deep tub and separate toilet room. We called the spa to see if they had any availability and luckily got an appointment for 90 minute massages. My #1 recommendation is to GO TO THIS SPA!!!! I've been in many and this was amazing. The hour before your massage, you have the use of whirlpools, cold plunge pools, soaking tubs, a a complimentary body scrub. I almost didn't need a massage. In three days, we went twice! The first night we ate at the Humu.... restaurant. Although it was hard to find (take your map if you're going exploring!) we enjoyed our dinner. Service was a bit lacking at the restaurant, but probably more because we had very high expectations. The beach is really nice, so I didn't use the pool. We explored around the island, so didn't eat too many meals at the resort. You should expect everything to be much more expensive at the resort than off property. Ths typical of all resort complexes. Overall, the resort is lovely. I do think the common areas could be cleaned more frequently. The stairs down past the shops didn't seem to be clean during our stay. This did not affect our stay; however, our expecations of a Waldorf are very high.

We stayed the week preceding Easter so obviously a busy time. All the concerns I had before my arrival were not a worry once we got there. Yes....it's expensive, but we knew that when we booked so we'd planned for that. The Grand Wailea is beautiful, we had 2 deluxe ocean front rooms on the 8th floor & they were just perfect for us, the view was incredible, slept at night with the doors open & fell asleep listening to the surf. Yes we had to pay an extra $50 dollars per night so we could insure we had adjoining rooms, but we knew that before we went, so not a problem. Plenty of room in the room & storage too, a fridge in each room & tastefully decorated. The pools are great, although the water elevator is IMO a waste of space. Not really sure what the point of that was, we as a family thought they would have been better off building a couple of extra slides instead....but....not really an issue. We tend to be more beach people too, so onto the next topic...chair games.....my concern before we went. Well, when I'm on vacaction the last thing I want to do is get up at 7am & reserve loungers, so we didn't. We got up when ever we woke, sometimes 9 sometime later....went down had a leisurley breakfast & then generally by 10ish maybe 11 we were ready to hit the beach......not once on the beach did I have a problem getting a lounger....there were always plenty. Never did we get an umbrella, but we are there to enjoy the sun, so we never wanted an umbrella...so not an issue for us. We moved the loungers to wherever we wanted so we didn't feel like we were on top of anyone else...it was perfect. We generally hit the pool in the afternoon after our beach time & again almost always found 2 loungers together, our kids didn't need them as they were always off in the pool. One afternoon we had to wait 30 mins for some loungers to free up....but no big deal...for us anyway. Yep, the price for Cabanas seems high, but if someone is prepared to pay for that, more power to them....I myself can't bear the shade so not something I'm interested in. So chair games are only an issue if you make them an issue. The price for snacks & drinks is silly, again we knew that before we went, but we took a collapsable cooler made a stop at walmart on our first day & stocked up on drinks & snacks, boogie boards...& always had a supply with us, poolside, beachside or when we were out & about. Although my kids did enjoy the Grand Wailea icee's, swore they were the best they've ever had! We had the deal where we got free breakfast as we stayed over a certain #of nights, it was just OK.......each day it's exactly the same offerings....so my thought is they could change the menu up a little....to avoid the repetition. I took my daughter to the SPA where we both got massages...never been somewhere before that would massage a 9 year old, but it was lovely.....being in the room together & getting spoilt...definetly a treat for her. Staff at the hotel were great, always friendly & always helpfull...no compaints there We rented a Suburban through Budget....no problems, brand new car. Had fun exploring...we went to Makena Beach & enjoyed some impressive surf, we did half the road th Hana, but ran out of time....we couldn't stop swimming in the waterfalls!! WE snorkelled at Molokini, which was pretty neat but the snorkelling does not compare to the Carribean....my opinion. We went to the Luau at the Grand Wailea which was fun...just remember to take cash, because if you want to buy anything form the vendors or the photos they take as you enter, you're unable to charge to the room. On our last day we were catchign the red eye back to the US so asked for late checkout.....they let us keep one of our rooms, until 7pm...at no charge, checkout is usually 12pm so that was a great deal....we got to enjoy the beach for the whole last day, & showered up & headed off to the airport....it was much appreciated. It was a great relaxing trip which none of us wanted to leave...If you can afford the Grand Wailea...go & enjoy...we're so glad we did.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotell and Great Setting\u201d", "Author": "jimf1111", "ReviewID": "UR105590572", "Content": "We just finished a five night stay at the Grand Wailea.

I was there 5 years ago and think that it is still in great shape contrary to other reviews . The pool is the best of any hotel I have stayed at and is the main attraction ( in my opinion) and why they can get the rates they charge . Beyond that my issues are, if I am spending $700 a night to stay someplace I do not expect to be nickeled and dime'd in other aspects such as required valet parking and $13.00 to use a computer to print my boarding pass for my departure. Six dollars for a 12 ounce orange juice is just silly . Commodity prices for produce has not gotten that silly yet to my knowledge .The other thing that seems to have gotten worse is the pre dawn towel chair group and the limited space near the entertainment pool for general seating as I call it . They have two pool areas , one is for adults and one is more fun for adults and kids alike depending on your likes or dislikes . The adult pool used to have l the cabana's for those who like that kind of thing and maybe more refined appearance. They have now lined the volly ball or wide area of the pool with these to earn more revenue I guess for those who want to spend more money or dont like sun ( not sure why go to Hawaii) . That leave's the rest to get there first for those chairs left on top of each other , or go to beach which is quite nice and where we spent the last day away from the crowded pool . Dont get me wrong , pool , rope swing and all are a blast but waves were great for boggie boarding. Obviously if you are spending the money through direct booking with hotel to stay there you can afford the fee's above or rent a cabana but its simply the principal that given the cost to stay there you would think they could provide a computer to print your boarding pass ,not demand valet parking and leave the cabana set to the quiet pool . It is convenient to the Wailea Shops ( very short walk ) . We were traveling with our 17 year old son and were at the Hyatt at Kaanapali Beach for the first 6 nights. For about $150 per night less we were on the Regency Club level with continental breakfast , evening appetizers and deserts at 7:30 no mandatory valet and a computer all set for you in the lobby free of charge to print your boarding pass . Our view was beautiful on the top floor and water front not water views as with the Grand Wailea (which is what I paid for and mostly got) . Kaanapali beach is about 3 miles , lined with other hotels , shopping at Whalers Village , and shuttle to Lahaina with all of its shops and restaurants within a few miles . I went to school in Hilo and have been back 9 times now , for value and location go to Kaanapali .

There was no mention of where the restaurants were located, what restaurant was open to people without a reservation (kinda hard to make a reservation when you arrive at meal time) and no map of the hotel was given. we were basically on our own to figure out where to get a meal after traveling 8 hours to get to our 5 star hotel. we went to a couple of the restaurants on the resort to try to get in to get a meal the first night and were told \"sorry you need a reservation..we can see about getting you in later that evening\" needless to say we went to bed with no supper. I do have to say that when we arrived in our room I read over all the info that about the restaurants and the features in the hotel and it was not until day 9 of our 10 day trip that a room service menu magically appeared in our room.

I stood by the chair and umbrella sign out stand with another lady who was having the same problem. when her husband came from the beach and told her he needed money so that he can pay the people doing the sweeps to find him 6 chairs he explained to his wife if he gave the money to the young men they would get him chairs right away. sure enough, not even 5 minutes later while standing in front to the chair sign out spot with his wife he came back and said we have chairs now and they left. I still had not been accomodated with chairs or an umbrella and My family arrived ahead of his. So we tried his theory...People when you are told there are no chairs left no worries, here are the steps you take to get some...step 1....ask for an umbrella or 2 depending on your family size. the young men will deliver it to your preferred location. step 2....while the young men are setting up the umbrella tell them that you have a few bucks for the amount of chairs you need. with our family it cost 8 dollars to have them find us 4 chairs. and we got them within 5 minutes of preforming step 2 . step 3...enjoy the sun. sit back people and watch the ones around you, it is very interesting. the young men who are serving patrons of the hotel on the beach in a half hour period definately make good money, the one we watched made at least 30 dollars from what we could see doing the chair sweep policy. chairs and umbrella's are left occupied by one person. usally a woman reading a book. she will be there for about half an hour and then she will disappear for about half an hour. If you go to the pool area (which was where my kids were splitting their time between the beach and the pool) you will see that same lady that was on the beach with her allotted amount of chairs, sitting at her other allotted amount of chairs next to the pool. This will go on all day as we found There are also some downfalls to the money for chairs policy in this hotel. We were a victim of the chair sweep on the 8th day. my family was on the beach enjoying the sun when we decided we should go to the ocean as a family of four and enjoy the waves and the ocean.we were gone less than 3 minutes when we witnessed the same young man who accomodated us with chairs the day before take our towel off of one of our chairs and slide it over to an umbrella next to us for 4 women we go our chair back however immediately after we got our chair back the 4 women disappeared to the pool area for over 3 hours. wonder why they needed our chair and how much did they have to pay for these chairs. for the next 2 days we could not swim in the pool or on the beach as a family as we had to have at least one person or more guarding our chairs. IF you drink coffee in the morning (provided by the hotel in rooms) make sure you leave your sugar packages next to the sugar holder on the counter,that way the cleaning staff know that you are in need of more sugar. we had many days in our stay that we were drinking black coffee due to the fact that we cleaned up our sugar packages off the counter. the days that we left the empty sugar packages on the counter our sugar was always restocked. beware that if you want to book a tour that most of the tours do not come to the Grand Wailea to pick you up, you have to drive yourself. BE SURE to rent a car at the airport when you get off your plane. we did not know that and found that you pay more for a car rental at the hotel than at the airport. shopping, there are very few options for shopping around this hotel. If you want reasonable priced shopping or meals, you have to rent a car.

Upon arrival, the hotel was reportedly at about 90% occupancy. There are approximately 780 rooms to the Property. Assuming an average of 3.0 people per room this would equate to 2100 guests more or less exclusive of staff during our stay. The facilities and staff simply can not come close to servicing that amount of people to any degree, let alone to a four or five star level. The main attraction to the hotel, the pools and slides become so crowded and so chaotic by noon that it is difficult to imagine that after the initial pleasure of merely being in Hawaii wears off the mid west or east coast traveler, one doesn't feel stressed over fighting over towls and chairs and space. It is Lord of the Flies at $1,000 a day. By 7:45 am 95% percent of the chairs around the multi level pool complex are completely taken. By 8:00 am 100% are taken. No one is actually using the pool or is even at the pool at that hour however. The one hour policy to \"reserve\" your chair is not enforced and in fact I actually witnessed on Friday March 25 at approx 11:00 am two young girls ages 8 and 10 , who had claimed two chairs and were quietly sitting next to me (which had been cleared by security about 30 minutes prior due to a guest placing a book there at approx 7:00 am and quickly disappearing) removed by hotel security because the guest returned 4 hours later and claimed he had BEEN USING THE CHAIR- A BLATANT AND OBVIOUS LIE. THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE SCARED, THE 5FT 10 260LB WHITE MALE GOT HIS CHAIR BACK,because the hotel secuity made the expedient decision after looking at thesize of the belligerent male and then the two little innocent girls who would be easier to deal with and the young girls had their day ruined. You could provide that friendly spring break experience for your kids without spending a 1,000 dollars a day for room and meals! Thank God the girls parents were not there at the time or there might have been a stabbing! So much for the blind eyes of Justice! Not once by the pool in five days did a server ever ask if we were interested in placing a food order. When we did eat by the pool the food was horrible. I do not mind the prices but the food was horrendous. The rooms were fair but can not compare to any four star or five star hotel in Kona, Lanai, or even next door at the Four Seasons. It is not enough for Management to say that occupancy is 90% and things get tight. A hotel need that number in order to make money so obviously the business plan for this Hotel coupled with the size and design do not provide functional utility for the guests ,and hence, this hotel constitutes a very poor value and a terrible waste of money. Management, let me tell you something: from 7am to 10 am the amount of people that are actually using the pool and need to legtimately \"claim\" a chair for immediate use is around zero.

First of all, the pool complex is a keiki's (child's) dream and entertains for 12 hours with no boredom. This is huge because the last thing you ever want to hear from your kids on a luxury vacation is \"I'm bored!\" and you won't hear it once.

I've requested this so many times on other trips only to find it's not an option. our 7 year old was thrilled with her chocolate-coconut pedicure and her cupcake bath bomb she bought in the gift shop. More importantly, she didn't have to feel excluded since my husband and I both enjoyed a spa morning. The napua tower rooms were wonderfully appointed and the view amazing. The hospitality room offered the daily breakfast, afternoon cookies and evening bar and appetizers and we so enjoyed the food, the company and the staff who knew us by name after one visit. Our dinner at Humu was fabulous with our daughter feeding the fish in the koi pond, getting to see and touch a lobster from the tank, and food that was just the perfection of fresh fish you would expect My Macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi was excellent.

While we had a nice time on our trip, we were disappointed with the Grand Wailee (given the price point). I will break down my review from the good to the not so good The good. Location of the Hotel is great and the beach and sunsets are magnificent. Also convenient to nearby hotels and shops at wailee, its a short walk Pools and grounds are nice Check in was not a problem although they did not offer us a room upgrade Room size is fine and bathroom size is also spacious Bed was pretty comfortable Humu restaurant was pretty good, we got a great table and had the most amazing sunset Courtesy room was a nice touch. given that checkout is noon and most flights off the island are at night, the hotel offers guests a courtesy room where you can stay by the pools on the day of your departure and when you are done, they will let you use a room to shower and get cleaned up for your flight. very nice touch Loved the grotto bar, richie the bartender was very nice and served great drinks The not so good Place needs some work, pool tiles are dis-colored and carpets are old and dirty. Paint was noticeable peeling in our bathroom. Most people dont know this but the owners of the resort recently filed for bankruptcy (feb 2011) I would imagine given the amount of leverage morgan stanley put on this and other properties they acquired, they skimped on the maintanence capital expenditures and the resort is starting to show this. Other than the two restaurants, there was not much else available on the property in terms of bars and entertainment The Vallet Parking is bad, long wait times and for $20 per day, its a ripoff. I would rather they charge me $10 per day and let me self park. Resort fee of $20 per day is also a joke, internet access is not very good and coffee is marginal. Also, they have a business center with computers available. You would think given that they charge you $20 per day for internet access that this would cover the use of their computers in the business center. But no, they want additional money from you to access their computer. Seems to me this is double charging. Also, computers were down at the resort several times which was more annoying to the bar staff than to the guests as they had to write up manual tickets for charges. While the pools and slides are fun, they dont have enough covered chairs available for their guests. Similar to Atlantis, people start saving seats as soon as the pool opens at 7 am. Additionally, they try and sell cabanas at $300 per day which takes away from available seating as a lot of these go unfilled. There were far more children at the resort than I would have expected. I am not against children (i have 3 of my own) I was surprised at the sheer volume, and there were a lot of young children. While this was not a problem per se, if you are looking for an adult vacation or a romantic vacation, this may not be the place, again given the high price point. Service is not what you would expect for the price you pay and the pool side waiters tend to cater to the cabana guests versus the other guests. This may seem a little petty but when we threw our robes into the hamper to be cleaned (after a few days of use) they never bothered to replace them, even after a call to the front desk. Do they expect you at a luxury resort to wear the same bathrobe for 8 days? there are other things i could mention but i think you get the point. My wife and I had a good time there and enjoyed our stay in Hawaii. Do I think we got good value for the price we paid, no unfortunately I dont think we received good value.

The spa is amazing and is a must-do for anyone who stays at or anywhere near the resort. In general we had a fantastic time, but we did make note of a couple of things that could be improved upon: - One downside to the pool was the limited number of pool chairs. People get in line at 7am to claim their pool chairs and some people leave them unoccupied for hours. The rule is one hour only, but on most days we saw chairs being left unoccupied for 2-3 hours. - Prior to our vacation we called and asked about cabana rentals and were told we wouldn't need to book a cabana in advance, that it could be booked when we arrived. Regardless of that information, we called the week before our vacation and booked a cabana near the baby beach. When we arrived at the resort we called to confirm the cabana rental and were told that they had no record of our cabana reservation. We figured they'd be a little apologetic, but they really weren't. We were then told that people book the cabanas months in advance (which was completely different from what we were told weeks prior to our trip). The upside was we saved $250 in the cabana rental for that day! - The food and drink service at the pool was hit or miss. We went an entire day without anyone coming to take a drink order. Late in the afternoon, we saw a server and my husband asked her if she could come over to get our drink order and she did, but with zero enthusiasm and customer service skills that most servers at a resort of this caliber would display.

The grounds are gorgeous, the beach is beautiful and the rooms are great. We had a deluxe ocean view room and it was well worth the extra money. A few things, however, to note. First off, is that there is not a first class restaraunt there. The \"main\" restaraunt attempts to appeal to a true tourist crowd with a service staff in tacky outfits and a fish lagoon surrounding it. For true 5 star dining, you need to go next door to Four Seasons where Spago offers the same incredible vantage point but with modern and professional service and decor. Also of note in terms of the property in general is that there are quite a number of kids around which makes for a little bit less relaxation. We had one issue with our room cleanliness. For the most part, it was excellent BUT there was an issue with the bath tub. For three days, we tried to get the bath tub cleaned properly (there were hair in it when we checked in) and it took until the fourth day to get it taken care of....not what you'd expect for $620 per night (although they made up for it with a cash deduction on our rate at the end due to this problem). All in all though, we had a great 10 day trip. This hotel is in a great location, has a great beach and is first class. Like elswhere in Maui, you'll need a car rented to get around but the Four Seasons next door is great for dining options and is in walking distance as is the Fairmont. Grand Wailea is a great place to stay, but hopefully they will upgrade their dining to a more modern 5 star experience like the rest of the property in short order...........", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livermore, California", "Title": "\u201cGrand Couple Getaway\u201d", "Author": "love2snorkel17", "ReviewID": "UR98125782", "Content": "40th Birthday Celebration vacation. The resort accommodations was a gift. We arrived early 9AM to preregister. My husband asked about the room and they told us we were being upgraded to an ocean view, I cried, because this is what I wanted. We were told the resort fee was being waved but there was a $20 a day valet fee which we were fine with. Resort fees should not exist, you already feel like you paid for resort then they add on this fee. I feel like I am actually getting a service with Valet Fee. They took our phone number to call us when our room was ready and informed us we were free to use the facilities and to leave our luggage but we had other plans with my brother. Nicole and Gilbert (front desk help) were very friendly and courteous. We got the call around 3PM that our room was ready. Bellman Robert (chris daughtry lookalike) was very polite and friendly and did his job well. We were very pleased with our room. Bathroom is huge. I enjoyed a good soak in bath to get all the sand out. Shower was also huge with ledge. Closet was perfectly sized with plenty of hangers. More than enough drawers for clothes. Balcony had table, two chairs, wooden clothes dryer rack, and ottoman. Alarm clock was iphone dock. Bed was a king, soft, white bedding which is a requirement of mine( you can see that it is clean) two kinds of pillows feather and normal to choose from. Room was quiet only noise we heard was day we were checking out we could hear luggage being rolled out early in AM. Housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping room clean and refreshing Towels, and toiletry products. The only odd thing was that there wasn't any coffee cups for our morning coffee so we had to use the glass cups. Never experienced this at a hotel. My brother who stayed at the Marriott said the same thing. Not sure the reasoning behind this. We had a refrigerator which we assumed we had to rent but it was unlocked, nice surprise. Not sure if this is included because person who gifted us the hotel is a hiltons honors member. We never hung out at the pool. Towels were set up early to save spots, but we had no interest to hang out at pool, we prefer the beach. They have a company that rents out snorkel equipment, paddle boards, and body boards with 4 and 7 day packages reasonably priced. It was nice to have chairs and umbrellas provided by the hotel on beach at no additional fee. Water stations around pool is a nice touch. We also enjoyed the POG juice and water at front desk. The valet men worked very hard, always provide cold bottled water in our rental car in the morning. We are not familiar with using valet but quickly learned we could call down to valet and have our car waiting for us. Every employee we interacted with was friendly and did their job well. One night I was half asleep and my husband asked me to put the TV on sleep timer since I had already figured it out. Well somehow I purchased a showtime episode in the process. A couple of days later we went to front desk to check if we were charged and also to explain that A robe was missing. Front desk completely understood the mistake and reversed the TV charge and had two robes sent up to our room with in 15 minutes. I explained we only needed one robe but was told to just keep both in our room. Every time we walked by an employee we were greeted friendly. Gardeners were constantly working on the grounds cleaning up leaves. The grounds are beautiful. The fitness center has a lot of equipment but older than what we are used to at home. We used it once.

The resort has breathtaking views and we were fortunate to have an upgraded room on the 9th (top) floor. However, the rooms felt less like a 5-star Waldorf Astoria and more like a typical 3-1/2 - 4 star hotel room. We actually asked for a new room after the first night because the room did not meet our expectations. The second room was a little bit cleaner but it still needed to be remodeled. Ironically, the resort was recently renovated in the past few years. The service lacked 5 star quality as well. Overall, we did enjoy the many amenities at the resort. First of all, the pool and beach area were top notch. There's a couples only pool or a family/fun pool with a waterslide and cave bar. Since Maui has one of the best climates in the world, huge pool and beach area was perfect for fun and relaxation. Also, the spa was top notch. My wife and I each enjoyed a massage. I recommend getting there an hour before so you can utilize the spa facilities because it is well worth it. For fitness, the excercise gym was one of the better facilities I've seen in a hotel. One final note, we ate at all of the restaurants including the pool restaurants and the food was just average in comparison to some of the other restaurants in the area.

The Fairmont and Four Seasons are more grown up and elegant in my opinion, but this is not what we wanted with young children. You can tell the resort was built in the early 90s and definitely needs a little updating (the peach paint on the exterior is cheesy), but the grounds are beautiful and huge. Until our children are older, we would not change a thing as they had the time of their lives. The fridge in our room was complimentary by the way. The room was decent and clean but not huge. You could see some wear and tear in the bathrooms, so updating will likely happen in the near future, one would hope. But these were all minor complaints as we had a fabulous holiday here.

The beach was right there as well if that's what you're looking for...great place to watch the sunset. The only drawback to the GW is the cost of staying there. We were fortunate enough to get a reduced rate on the room so we might have noticed this more than people that have the money to stay at such a nice hotel but when you're ordering $21 fruity drinks ($14 if you keep the plastic pineapple, which we lost twice, they're GOO-OOO-OOOD) and paying $55 each for brunch it's a bit much.

We were originally scheduled to stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani but had to change our plans due to a big snowstorm. I had looked at staying at the Grand Wailea for our entire trip but I was worried that it would just be too much of a \"scene\" for us and not be relaxing. I walked over the Grand Wailea the day before we checked in and talked to one of the clerks at the registration desk. She could not have been nicer. I explained our situation and she said \"yeah, come on over and spend all day, even if your room is not ready...\". So that's what we did. We wore our swimsuits and coverups and left all our luggage with the bellman until our room was ready. We arrived at about 12:00 and our room was ready a little after 1:00. Nice. The front desk called my cell to tell me. I left the kids and hubby at the pool and met the bellman and he took me to our room with all our luggage. He was very friendly and filled me in about the property, The bellman suggested that I get a refrigerator for the room when he found out I have two kids, but he didn't tell me it is $8.00 a day. Not a big deal, but I would have liked to know upfront. The front desk told me that our room was a complimentary upgrade. The room was on the ground level and it had a view of a little grassy area and some paths that lead to the upper pool. If I looked at a certain angle there was a peek-a-boo view through the trees to the ocean. The room was smaller than the Kea Lani suite (as I knew it would be) the bellman opened the slider to the patio and it was pretty. The bathroom was a little worn, with cracked tiles and mildew (I hate when other people point this out, but it was!). The first impression was good, but upon closer look you could see that this room was worn and needed some TLC. The beds were made but you could clearly see indentations on the pillowtop/mattress top, like the mattress was worn out. There are white shutters that slide over the patio door at night instead of drapery. I was ok with the room until we tried to go to sleep and I could hear music and people talking and walking and pushing carts on the tile floors. I hardly slept at all the first night and either did my husband. I guess our room was off the the side below the Grand Ballrooom and there was loud music going that we could clearly hear from our shuttered room. Also, when the room was closed up it smelled kind of bad/musty. I couldn't wait to open the big slider each time we came in. My kids were crazy about the pool. There was plenty of seating. The first day we sat by the activities desk and it was loud and busy with the music playing and lots of people coming and going. The next day we sat near the upper pool deck and there was hardly anyone around, plenty of chairs both shade and sun. There was no issue trying to find a chair. I spent quite a bit of time going down the slides and the lazy river/rapids and my kids loved it that we were all in the pool together. We ate lunch at the volcano bar and none of us really liked our lunch. Ok, strike one. Later, my hubby and I went to the Molokini rest/bar and I had the WORST lava flow drink ever. It tasted like they put dish detergent in my glass w/ the drink. My husband had a tropical drink and it was very weak. We decided not to eat dinner there and left for Tommy Bahama's at The Shops at Wailea. The next day I enjoyed the pool and I ordered two more drinks, one was GREAT and the other was borderline bad. The waitress said it depends on who the bartender is on duty. Not really my problem, when I am paying $14 for a drink they should all be good. On the good side, the grounds are stunning and I took tons of pictures of the fountains and grounds and I even bought a painting of the chapel. There are other pretty properties that have more consistent food and drink service, so I'm not sure that the grounds make up for the terrible drinks and the worn room. One more issue bothered me that I will mention. Recently the GW instituted mandatory valet parking for $20 a day in addition to the $25 a day resort fee. I knew about it in advance. One night it was raining heavily and we waited about 15 minutes for our car and then they parked it out in the rain, not even under the canopy. The valet did bring the umbrella to the car for me, but my husband and kids walked in the rain, it defeats the purpose of having a valet, right? It happened again the next day when we checked out, we had all our luggage and were waiting and waiting for our car for about 15 minutes (even though we called from our room). When the valet finally brought our car he parked it on the far side of the drive from where we were standing. It really frosted me that we had to do the mandatory $20.00 valet and they can't even pull the car up to me (there weren't that many people out there). Maybe they are cutting corners on drinks, food, and staff due to the bankruptcy, but I am still paying top dollar to stay there. It was fun to check out, but I wouldn't stay there for more than a night or two, not even sure about that. I will just say again that there are other properties that have more consistent service. The Grand Wailea has so much potential if they can work out some of their service issues and give the rooms some TLC. I hope that they can emerge from bankruptcy stronger and more consistent.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cOur third visit...cannot wait to return for the fourth and more\u201d", "Author": "ATP1", "ReviewID": "UR96522463", "Content": "This is our favorite hotel.

Upon arriving we were greated by a valet attendant who told us we could not self park, we did not know this when we had booked the hotel and probably would have not if we had known this. We had saved up our money for this special occasion to stay at here and weren't expecting an extra $25/day. And during our stay we observed guests going to their own cars and not using the valet. Upon checking in the receptionist was not friendly, she seemed very rushed and sent us on our way with the bellman to take us to our room. The room itself was overlooking the Molokini parking lot but had great views of the ocean from the balcony and the smell from the flowers below was incredible although it was constantly loud when outside on the balcony. The room itself was fine although our shower did not work the 2nd day there, we called the front desk who said maintenance would be taking care of it, when we arrived back at the hotel later that evening it had still not been fixed, finally at 10pm, when we were in bed they called to let us know it would be fixed by the morning and that we could change rooms if we wanted, at this late time we decided to wait until morning. The shower was not fixed until the 3rd day and they did not charge us the resort fee for our stay which was nice. The maintenance personnel, housekeeping and valet attendant staff were all very friendly despite the problems we had. My husband and I enjoyed using the adult pool and strolling along the beach, if you are going there for a pool experience this would be the place to go. We were also shocked by the price of food at the hotel and realized by the 2nd day that we would go elsewhere for food, $12 for a breakfast burrito and $13 for a quesadilla!! That's a little ridiculous to me, we ended up spitting those 2 meals so it would be cheaper.

It was our first trip to Maui and our purpose was to relax. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with water features and sculptures everywhere. The lush gardens are constantly being worked on - we thought they were beautifully kept. The hotel's facilities were wide ranging: the extensive pools were fantastic fun for all ages. There was staff located at each rapid, or at the tarzan swing from 10am to 5pm for safety. The rapids and slides are closed outside of these times - but there was plenty of other pool space to enjoy after that. We were able to get sun beds every day at our leisure - there was no annoying reserving of stuff at 6.30 am. The Spa Grande was a lovely experience. We took the special deal $149 which gave an hour's use of the spa baths/saunas etc before a 50min massage (included $25 toward a lunch/dinner at Molokini bistro). I thought this was an enjoyable and indulgent experience - both our masseurs were great. Make sure you get there an hour before your massage to use the different baths and saunas etc. The gym was excellent for a hotel - better equipped than some professional gyms! There are some gym classes but some you have to pay an extra $10 eg. spin classes. The yoga classes are complimentary. Give it a go even if you're a beginner. I liked the 7am beach yoga with no-nonsense Nancy. Our room was in the lagoon wing on the 1st floor. Great king size bed, beautiful bathroom - all kept clean. Wifi in room. Everything good quality and worked. Amazing sunsets. Breakfast in the Grand Dining room - a huge buffet with American/European/Hawaiian/Japanese dishes and an egg station. During our 10-day stay we were always able to choose something we liked from the buffet. Staff was quick to refill, in our experience. Egg guy was great. We found the staff at Grand Wailea to be friendly and non-intrusive (which is how we like it). I suppose I could go on - but the review is already a bit rambling. On the whole we had an amazing stay - something for everyone. The one annoyance was the $25 daily resort fee. You know of course before you book. I liked the fact that you didn't have to go with the valet parking at $20 a day but you could self-park and this was included in the $25 fee. They have now changed this arrangement and you have to take the valet parking at $20 p/day and the resort fee has been reduced to $20 p/day.

We dined one evening at Spago at Four Seasons, which was terrific, skip the crabcake (poor) and the atmosphere was very serene, but overall, the Grand Wailea has it all over the Four Seasons. SERVICE: The serivce is comparable in terms of friendliness and capability with the main difference in being the Four Seasons employees were more proactive approaching guests (due to their relatively small size). We had the pleasure of staying in the Napua tower (exclusive tower) and the staff was 100% friendly and helpful. To note, Nupua tower includes an extended continential style breakfast (excellent by the way and we ate there each morning), as well as afternoon tea and cocktail time with lite bites each evening. Loved the free business center and Internet. We are Hilton HHonors Gold using points and even the $25 resort fee was waived! Valet parking staff was exceptional and worth the $20/day. Not only did they deliver the cars quickly and with a smile, but they offered help navigating the island. ROOMS: Casual island elegance. We had an ocean view, king bed. Bed lovely, bathroom very spacious and this coming from someone with a 50 sq. foot shower at home. maid staff very good and left lovely surprises in the evenings and departure. Walls thick so you dont hear neighboring rooms, plantation shutters kept room 100% dark. View awesome of ocean and mountains! Our room had fridge at no charge. Large LCD hi-def TV. GROUNDS: Inside and out...Immaculate, extraordinary and just plain paradise. This is where the resort simply crushes the Four Seasons next door. The Four Seasons looks like a motor lodge next to the Grand Wailea (inside and out) and they should be ashamed of their pool area compared the GW. We were at GW during high season, and there were NO CROWDS, kids were wll behaved and mostly confied to kids pool areas. Think luxury, beauty combined with convenience. The GW also has the nicest, widest stretch of beach with no rocks. snorkeling excellent to the left and right side of beach. Lunch excellent, facilities wonderful...not so much at the Four Seasons. Downside would be action closes early, with food done by 10pm unless you go room service. Shops of Wailea close though with plenty of low cost options.

It starts with a warm welcome and a quick and uncomplicated check in. The rooms are amazing. We stayed in a ocean view room on the 6th floor, overlooking parts of the hotel own park and the ocean. The rooms are very big, with complimentary fast WiFi, a big TV (which we never used), a nice balcony and any amenity that makes your stay comfortable. The bathroom is really big and maybe the nicest part of the whole room. The whole hotel complex is very well maintained, it almost looks like Disneyland, but it's real. The breakfast buffet is amazing, with all kind of fresh fruit, pancakes, bagels, various juices, a omelett/egg station that cooks them according to your personal preference. We once had dinner at the humuhumunukunuku and that was a great experience as well. The food is simply delicious. The pool area is very big, with many interconnecting pools and slides. The masterpiece for us was the swim-up bar. Sipping you MaiTai while being in the water and enjoying the Maui sun is simply priceless. The only downpoint about the hotel is that the service staff was once in a while not completely up to upscale, european hotel standards. But in general they did an ok job and I was told that on Hawaii, clocks tick a little different. The second downpoint, but that you know it when you book a waldorf astoria resort, is the high prices. If you can't pay it with a smile, don't do it. Just to give you an idea, the two of us together paid for the ocean view room per day, with breakfast, lunch and dinner including drinks, tips, taxes and so on about 1000$ per day, about 150 dollar per day we spent on drinks only, i was quite thirsty :) For me that was well worth it and i would go back in a heartbeat if ever I am on Maui again.

In the three other hotels we stayed throughout our two weeks, this was the only hotel that actually recognized our honeymoon. We stayed in the exclusive Nupua Tower which offers continental breakfast and cocktails/apps in a private lounge. The lobby bar was wonderful with live music and Humu's was the most romantic dinner for our last night. The pool is one of the most amazing pools ever. Everytime you explore, you find a new waterfall, slide or hideaway to layout. The grotto swim-up bar is the coolest thing I've ever seen - swim up to a built-in table or hide under the waterfall to sip on your mai-tai - too cool. We had a wonderful Hawaiian pizza at the Bistro restaurant for lunch and had to take home the touristy pinapple souvenier glasses! Finally, we must comment on the spa. Kohler Spa is the only other spa in the many spas I've visted that even comes close to this unique experience.

We paid over $12,000 for three rooms from December 22-27, 2010. We quickly realized we were paying the higher price not for the luxury we expected, but simply because demand exceeded supply over the holidays. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to appreciate crowds by the pools and waterslides and the inability to get food after 11:30 pm, this is not the resort for you. Our grievances throughout our stay are as follows: Check-in: While we were greeted warmly and efficiently, we were provided with very little information about the resort. For example, no info about pool times, the necessity of getting a wristband to be around the pool, etc. We appreciate that this is the peak time at the hotel, but some words of warning about crowds at breakfast and around the pools would have certainly have been helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we waited almost 20 minutes to get a table at breakfast and it was almost impossible to find chairs at the pool. Rooms: Our rooms were spacious and comfortable. However, there were small annoyances that you would not anticipate when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying almost $4000/room for a five-night stay. In one room, light bulbs were burned out, and in another, the toilet would run constantly. At least maintenance was reasonably prompt to respond to these issues. Activities: When working with the concierge desk, they were very helpful at booking activities and making dinner reservations. However, their information regarding the activities was both limited and inaccurate. We were provided no information about the ticketing process/table assignment for the luau (which we would recommend, once we figured it out!), the concierge gave us false information about the end time and transportation time for one of our tours, and we were led to believe use of the tennis facilities was include. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact the tennis facilities have no association with the resort) While our stay, overall, was pleasant, it is simply not what you would expect when paying the rates that we paid.

The bed was very comfortable, the room, bathroom, patio, were huge, and very well appointed. Beautiful bathrooms, beautiful furniture, and we even had a waterfall near our door in one of the many amazing gardens. Humu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: I got a Mai Tai, which normally I am not a fan of when they give them out at most Hawaiian hotels, but this was highly recommended by some other guests; let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say I am a fan of Humu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mai Tais. Wow! The service was impeccable, attentive, and knowledgeable. The food was all good. I recommend the Ahi Traps. Resort food tends to be expensive, thought the GW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t outrageously expensive, it was actually less than I expected. (Please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use this as a cue to raise your prices). Pools: For being at 100% occupancy, the hotel sure did not feel crowded. They really did a great job of laying things out, having a variety of pools, etc. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, it was pretty crowded, but it still felt personable, lots of small pool areas, etc. Most of the chairs were taken if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rush out at 6am, but we eventually found two chairs together both days. Also, be sure you go to the activities desk and get a wrist band each day. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this our first day, and security will ask you to leave if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one. I guess people try to sneak in from the Four Seasons or the Marriott? There were a lot of children, though Hawaii is a family destination, so we expected this. Most were very well behaved, supervised by parents, etc. But I feel I need to warn others who are looking for more of an adult only retreat, thought they did have an adult only pool, but that was more crowded than others. The pools are fun. They have a network of waterslides connecting the pools and even have a water elevator if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to climb the stairs. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I have been to a water park type place in over 20 years; let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say I had a lot of fun. Many other adults were partaking in the waterslides too. Pool/Food/Bars: We have stayed in a lot of resort type places over the past few years, and the GW is defiantly in the top two to three. The staff is so nice and helpful, very personable. The drinks by the pool are reasonably priced for a resort of this caliber, and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The food was amazing, even with pool side service. The pool side service is slow, but the wait staff always told us what the expected time would be, as they prepare all of the food fresh. They also have a grotto bar that you swim up too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inside a cave with flowers growing out of the walls, amazing! Though the music gets loud later in the day, but they have tables outside the bar as well, also in the water.

It was an amazing experience, beautiful grounds which we walked for hours, amazing hospitality, and everything was just designed really well. There is shopping on site, and an outdoor mall within walking distance. They have activities on site, though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t participate in much on this stay.

Everything about the hotel was lovely, no complaints there. My husband & I had Grand Wailea spa treatments, they were fine. We were so excited to share the pools/slides with our kids, ages 6 12, and 16. And while it was fun, for a few days, it was way too crazy and crowded. Like others said, if you weren't down to the pools by 7:30 a.m., you did not get a chair...the WHOLE day! One morning someone removed all our stuff and it ended up in security. It is just a frenzy, too stressful when all you want to do is relax!! After a week at the Grand Wailea, we moved to a condo just a 1/4 mile down the road and I was SO surprised, our kids said they liked the condo better! Didn't expect that! I'm glad we got to experience the Grand Wailea ONCE, but I would not stay here again. If you do go, upgrade to the Napua tower, the concierge wing of the hotel. The breakfast and evening \"appetizers\" were all we needed for breakfast/dinner, it saved us some $$. Lunches for five of us came to at least $125 at the poolside eating place, so having the \"free\" food made us happy! (We still usually went out to dinner, but it was nice to have that option). And the GW, at least when we were there, is definitely a family place. If you are honeymooners, I would definitely go somewhere else more romantic and quiet. This reminded me a little of Disney World, happy to be there for a few days but even more happy when you leave! :)", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Red Bank, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot so Grand Wailea\u201d", "Author": "KimD7", "ReviewID": "UR89175482", "Content": "Stayed at the Wailea as the second part of my honeymoon. Wish I continued my stay at the Four Seasons on the big island. Problems started at check in. Not sure why the front desk staff would think it was a good idea (knowing it was our honeymoon) to put us in a room right in front of the water slide. We tried to access the pools later that afternoon, and the next day but the pool decks, and the beach were way overcrowded to the point of being unsafe. This hotel is definitely not a Waldorf nor is the staff trained properly. The hotel allows outsiders to access their pool, as long as they have a bracelet and they don't monitor to make sure you are a hotel guest. If you are looking for a Nascar tailgate, complete with coolers, and cans of beer, or a spring break atmosphere this is your spot. Needless to say after dealing with the clientele, and the staff being severely under-trained we left property and went to the beach in town. Town beach was less crowded and people were much nicer, good thing we paid good money for the amenities so others could use them. Once the weekend was over and the crowds subsided somewhat, the hotel informs us that the spa was under repair and that the women had no locker room. Thanks for letting us know in advance considering the spa treatment was booked 6 months in advance. The next day Tuesday the hotel made us aware that 2 of the 3 restaurants would close earlier then advertised, and the pools, and slides were going to be closed for renovations. I couldn't take any more I contacted the management, and a week later I am still waiting for the supervisor on duty to call me back. did I mention that the staff is not trained properly, and that this is not a Waldorf. So if Jaime [-] is reading this I am still waiting for your response.

I am a Hilton HHonors member (Diamond level) and used Hilton free night certificates for my stay, so the only out of pocket costs I had were for my incidentals, which were minimal since I only had dinner at the resort one night. When I was making my reservations, I noticed that the least expensive rooms for the dates of my stay were around $400 + tax. I think that the majority of people who are disappointed with this property probably fall into two categories: 1) People who are used to five star properties with a high level of service and superior amenities and find the Grand Wailea coming up short, or 2) People who have never stayed at a property as expensive as the Grand Wailea, are doing so for a special occasion, and expect more for the price paid. I think that at the GW, a lot of what you are paying for is the location and the property itself, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily think it is a true \u00e2\u20ac\u0153five star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd property with respect to the guest rooms or service. Location: The hotel is on the beach in Wailea, which is a very nice, upscale area in South Maui. This was my first trip to Maui, and if I returned, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if I would stay in Wailea again or if I would try somewhere on West Maui. I did like the walking path along Wailea beach, and the proximity of the GW to different places to shop and dine. The Grand Wailea is on a good part of Wailea beach; some of the other hotels do not have much (if any) beach area, but GW is on a wider, sandy part of Wailea Beach. Amenities: This is a stunning property. I did not get to see all the art or take a tour since it was not offered when I was there, but the architecture and grounds, including the many pools and landscaping, are beautiful. The beach area is pretty nice (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a beach snob so my expectations in this area are very high), and the staff will set up chairs and umbrellas on the beach for guests (one guy was good about setting up a chair for me with a little more distance between me and other people, but the guy the next day was trying to pack everyone in very close together). The property has a large, well equipped, and well air-conditioned fitness room, which I used one morning for strength training. The GW has several restaurants. I only tried Humu (it has a longer name) for a drink at the bar and dinner. I enjoyed my dinner (fresh fish entr\u00c3\u00a9e, side vegetable, glass of wine) there, and I felt that the prices there were reasonable for the Wailea area and a resort restaurant (I looked at menus for the restaurant at the Wailea Marriott and some of the restaurants at the Shops at Wailea, where I ended up having dinner one night at Tommy Bahama). Self parking at the GW was free; the garage spaces were small as others have stated, and the garage also does not have any elevators. The property is huge and kind of hard to figure out where you are at first, but it was not insurmountable, and I was fine after the first day. A larger property map would be useful, because it was hard to read the small one they gave me, and more signs around the property and on buildings would help too. Rooms: The rooms were nice enough, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blow me away. I understand that with the exception of the Napau tower rooms, other guest rooms at the GW are pretty much the same, and the location/view determines price. My room was a first floor (actually on the second floor because they have \"ground\" floor rooms) room that the front desk person told me was an upgrade (I think she called it a \"lagoon\" or \"garden\" view room), but I actually had a nice view of one of the pools and the ocean from my room/balcony, so I was happy with it. There was a balcony with a table and chairs, but I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it. My room had two queen size beds, a desk, a chaise lounge chair, a dresser with a flat screen TV on top of it, and a bar area with a coffee maker and glassware/ice bucket. There was a locked cabinet below the bar counter where I assume that they place mini- refrigerators if people choose to rent one. There was a safe in the closet, but it was not large enough for my laptop. The bathroom was very large with a separate tub, shower with a seat, vanity, and separate room with toilet. It had an ornately tiled floor area, but IMO, the tub and shower tiles were kind of dated and not that attractive. Oh, and I know this sounds petty, but I hated the provided toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, moisturizer), which I guess were supposed to be tropical but had an overpowering smell like some of the suntan lotions (e.g., Hawaiian Tropic or Banana Boat). I had my own products, but I just wanted to warn others who might try to pack light. Staff/service: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not someone who regularly stays at five star resorts, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need or even want a lot of attention or hovering staff, but I want any questions or problems addressed efficiently and in a timely manner. I would rate the staff/service level as acceptable but not exceptional. I interacted with the front desk staff at check-in, again the day before my departure to check about a late checkout, and at checkout. I had a flight after 8 pm to be followed by over 20 hours of travel to get home, so this was one time when I was hoping for a late checkout (I got my checkout extended until 2 pm). It is hard for me to put in words why I felt that service was just average. I did not experience any staff who were rude, but for the most part customer facing staff did not come across as being as well-trained, polished, and/or service-oriented as I would expect in what is supposed to be the top tier Hilton brand, and processes seemed a little impersonal. For example, when I called the specified number around 6 pm to make a dinner reservation, I got an automated message that the office was closed, and I should call the restaurant I wanted to book directly (and they disconnected my call). I had another underwhelming experience with the GW phone system when I called before my stay with a couple of questions about general room amenities. Also, the staff member who checked me out had to ask someone else (in the office) when I asked about being able to use internet on my laptop after checking out (internet access is free to guests as part of the resort fee, but once you have checked out, you need to get some guest login code to use wifi in the lobby area). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first person to ask this, so I would have expected that front desk staff would be able to answer this question. Housekeeping (or others) seemed to come into the room frequently. On the full day I was there, they were in once to do the cleaning (late morning to mid afternoon), again after cleaning to leave two bottles of water and a note, and again after that to do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turndown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service (which seemed kind of unnecessary since my beds only had the white sheets and comforters on them anyway). My service at Humu was pretty good, both for dinner and when I got a drink at the bar. I never got a lei which is supposed to be one of the amenities provided (in fairness though, I never asked about it).

I had reserved a garden terrace room area...and we walked in our room..and we had a partial ocean!!! I thought I was in the wrong room...thank goodness we weren't. It was more then I could have imagined!!! We could even hear the ocean waves!!!!!! So, we had a view of the beautiful chapel...garden, AND OCEAN. What more could we ask for!!!! All the employees were soooo accomodating and FRIENDLY. They all greeted you \"Aloha\", all the time!!! with smiles!!!! The surrounding gardens..and waterfall outside our room...topped it off!!! The inside of the hotel was beyond belief beautiful..all the statues...flowers, the mermaid in the lobby surrounded by the bluest water ever was one of my favorite things about the hotel....just soooo beautiful, and the bar/lounge was beyond that. Some of the rooms had overflowing flowers hanging from the balconies...how beautiful it was. Everywhere you looked was beauty to be found..not to mention the blue ocean that you could view from soooo many areas in the hotel!!! The pools were just breathtaking....tiles in flowers at the bottom of each pool...grassy area lounge chairs to relax on....even some on the beautiful lawn OVERLOOKING the beach..ugh!!!! The cocktail waitress was sooo friendly...she packed her bags and moved there....she looked so happy!! Why wouldn't she be..her office was blue hawaii :-) The Grand Dining Room was just over the top gorgous!!! We loved it there. Food was soooo beautiful and yummy, and the service was so friendly and inviting!!! We went there ..at least four times. You just can not beat the view in this dining room..no wonder they call it the Grand Dining Room..it is!!!!!! There is also a very beautiful shopping area outside the hotel...very nice. Not to mention the Shops of Wailea which are right around the corner, outside the hotel....soooo nice. Tommy Bahama's was beyond yummy...we ate there twice...great service, great people, great staff!!! I highly recommend it!!!! All and all I consider myself lucky to have stayed there...I would go back in a minute!!! Give yourself a treat ....and don't think twice, you won't be sorry. I can't wait to go back!!!", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic grounds and pools, OK rooms, great location, expensive!\u201d", "Author": "ryanfrommd", "ReviewID": "UR84832091", "Content": "Stayed here October 2010 with a conference. The conference rate was substantially below the rack rates for the rooms. Grounds are fantastic- one of the nicest hotels I've ever been to, and I have traveled a fair amount. Truly impressive- especially the pools, which may be some of the nicest in the world. They have a lei greeting and an impressive entrance. I was a little disappointed when we checked in, because the person at the front desk gave me a hard time about the room type. I brought my wife with me and the room type was a big deal for us- this was both a late anniversary celibration and her birthday was the final day of our trip. We wanted it to be special. I used to have a fairly decent Hilton Hhonors level status, but we have two young kids and I lost it since I haven't traveled as much since they were born. I mention this because as with any other hotel, your status matters in how they treat you. Since our conference rate was the same price for a variety of room types, this issue probably wouldn't apply to those who pay a set price for a specific room type. I booked way ahead to reserve a 'deluxe oceanfront' room. A colleague with higher Hhonors status who booked when only garden view rooms were available requested an oceanfront room (right next to me in line) and they gave it to him without hassle. The person at the counter gave me a garden room and then told me three times that room types are not guaranteed. I was getting ready to ask for a manager when she finally (reluctantly) agreed to give me the room type I booked. I would understand if she said it once to make the point, but I just traveled 15 hours from the east coast to get there, and I expect that if the hotel can simply accomodate the request I made, that they do so without hassling me. Although the start was rocky, the rest of the stay improved. Again, the grounds are fantastic. Amazing. The room itself was nice, but not commensurate with the price of the hotel. I would have been a little disappointed if we paid full price. As many other reviews state, you are paying for the grounds. They're worth it. Our view was not as good as a couple of other oceanfront rooms on site that my colleagues got, but I did have an ocean view and that was good enough. Our room had a shower and large (non-jetted) tub and a balcony with a table and chairs. The pictures on the website seem to be fairly accurate- this is not always the case with some hotels, but what you see is what you get here. This room would have been expected in a standard hilton beach property, but not in a waldorf astoria. It is due for a remodel in the rooms. I had emailed in advance about a fridge for the room because food is EXPENSIVE on and near the property. Get a rental car, because a cab is about $60 each way to/from the airport and there is great food fairly reasonably priced in Kihei about 5 miles down the road. Parking was a little annoying- the parking garage is a quarter mile down the road if you don't want to pay for the valet. The on-site eating options are good, but quite expensive. We had dinner at humuhumunukunukuapuaa and it was very nice. My wife had lobster and steak, and I had sushi and fresh fish ceviche. Both were nicely prepared. They told me the fridge would be $25 for the whole stay. When I checked in, they said $5 delivery charge plus $8 a day. Then when we checked out after five nights, there was an almost $80 charge (no idea where they got this figure)! The front desk happily adjusted it to $25 when I showed the email that I got from the hotel representative. The worst part- the fridge was already in the room the whole time!!! All they did was come in and use a key to unlock the cabinet where it was stored. On the second day of our stay, we noticed that the fridge had frozen our items. The milk was a hard slush, beers were nearly frozen, everything else was inedible because it was too cold. Tried turning down the thermostat, that only made it worse. Everything froze hard, so we couldn't use the milk for our coffee and I was afraid the glass beer bottles would explode if I took them out by hand. I mentioned the problem to the front desk and they volunteered to get us a new fridge and replace all the food items right away. They replaced the beer, milk, and cream. We also had bought guacamole dip and french onion dip at the grocery store. They replaced them with fresh guacamole and had the chef whip us up some french onion dip using Maui sweet onions. I mention the fridge incident not because I hold it against the hotel that the first fridge broke, but because it shows that they do take the effort to try and fix problems when they occur. Although we had a rough day without our coffee, the effort the hotel made to fix it made up for the problem. The dips were delicious! When not at the conference, we did the typical tourist stuff (road to hana, sunrise at the volcano, etc.). But I spent the most (non-work) time at the pool. The slides and lazy river are great! Spent some time (and a few bucks) at the grotto bar. If you pay a little extra, you can get a big pineapple mug that holds a lot more than the other cups and you get a whole lot more drink for you money the rest of your trip. I didn't figure this out until too late. Speaking of drink deals, there was a (unadvertised, as far as I could tell) happy hour in the main bar in the middle of the hotel from 5-6 with a serious discount on mai tais. The beach in front of the hotel is pristine. Swimming there is comfortable and safe. We booked a snorkeling trip to two sites- Molokini crater and turtle town. Drove a half hour north of the hotel to get to the boat (boss frogs, which was inexpensive and great), and they went to molokini first. Then, turtle town ended up being directly in front of the hotel!!! If you have (or rent) snorkel gear, you can easily check out the turtles on the southern end of the beach in front of the hotel. You can swim or kayak out just a little bit and see the turtles surfacing. Some were almost as big as a vw beetle. My wife visited the spa on her birthday and loved it. The locals had told us (when we mentioned where we were staying) that our hotel had the best spa on the island. My wife didn't try any others, but certainly enjoyed this one very much. In summary, the grounds were amazing, the room was nice (if not quite up to our expectations), and expect to pay extra for everything. The location in Wailea is great. Stay here, but don't expect to do so frugally! We had a wonderful trip and while there were a couple of things that could have been done better, the hotel generally met or exceeded our expectations and we would stay here again.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Five-Star Stay Worth Ten Stars\u201d", "Author": "UncleOtto34116", "ReviewID": "UR84488327", "Content": "The following is an email I sent to Matthew Bailey, Managing Director, after our stay: Aloha Matt, My wife and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island and Maui and wanted to commend some of your staff for an incredible experience while at Grand Wailea from 9/28-10/1. First off, the property was fantastic and exceeded our expectations. You truly have a great hotel. We could not have had a better experience for our delayed honeymoon. Individually we want to thank Zenith and Jay in the concierge area for the great service and attention we received during the stay. The attention to detail and knowing our preferences by the end of our first evening visit was noted and appreciated. They were personal yet professional every evening. Jay was equally attentive on the mornings we visited for breakfast. Of course that service would not have been possible without the attention we received at check-in from Haren. He assisted in the room upgrade to Napua Tower which made our stay truly magnificent. The dinner we had at Humuhumunukunukuapua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a was outstanding. Our server Matt was very attentive and made excellent suggestions as well as taking some great photos for us.

The beach is one of the nicest I have ever been to, the hotel is spotless, but the service is no match for the location. We arrived at the hotel at 10 am with several bags, and here was no porter available to help with the bags, we shuffled our way to the front desk. Check in took over 40 minutes because we had to email proof that we had booked an ocean view room to the front desk clerk, so she could print it out and take it to her supervisor (we showed her the confirmation on the phone). We were then told that there is a $10 baggage handling fee and $3 daily tip for the maids added to the room...on top of the $25 resort fee. We were told we could check our luggage in while or room was being prepared. This consisted of us rolling it ot the bell desk, and them leaving it there all day unsecured. When it was finally time to go to our room several hours later, the porter took my boyfriend's 2 bags and left me to tag along behind managing all my own luggage. I guess they figured they were getting their $10 anyway, so why put out an extra effort. The next day i decided to go to the pool - the desk at the adult pool is closed, you have to go down the stairs and around the corner, but there is also a beach desk,which is closer, I thought I would just go there to grab a towel, but I was told quite firmly by the 7 staff members sitting in the shade I needed to back up the hill and around the corner to get a towel for sitting next to the pool. Fair enough, but maybe one or two of those 7 could have been sent to actually staff the desk at the adult pool? Oh and if you want any shade, you need to rent a cabana - because they have been placed in all the areas that have shade. It seems everything is just a \"nominal\" fee, but it feels like this resort is nickel and diming it's customers to death. A room fridge is $8 a day, and there are actually only 1-2 classes a day at the fitness center tht are included, the rest are $10 It's all just little things, like the brochure says Hilton Honours members get a daily newspaper, and we don't, but after the check in fiasco, neither one of us wants to deal with the front desk. It's made me not even want to try the spa for fear of what they are going to layer on there. It really is a shame.

Even the drive up to the entrance is an event. In front of the hotel is a giant waterfall that was nothing short of spectacular. Upon arrival we were met by a group of bellmen who took our luggage and presented us with tea leaf leis. Check in was very quick once the room was ready. We arrived rather early so we had no expectation that it would be. In the meantime they stored our luggage and we were free to enjoy the amenities. The lobby area is incredible. There is a pond by the lobby bar, large sculptures everywhere, and great views of the ocean. Our room was on the top floor of the main building, overlooking the ocean. The upgrade to an ocean view room will not disappoint and will be more than worth the extra money. We woke up every morning to beautiful sunrises and crashing waves all from the comfort of our bed. The room itself was more spacious than most standard hotel rooms, allowing room for a sofa and generous workspace. The in room dining menu is comparably priced to going to just about any restaurant in the area. The food is good, service is excellent and best of all every balcony has a table and chairs that is more than suitable for dining. Meals taken on the balcony were less of a meal and more of an experience. The concierge was incredibly helpful in planning our activities and she was a great source of ideas for what to do. The pools were great, but a little disappointing. The water elevator is slightly over hyped. Yes, it is very unique, but it takes FOREVER to get to the top and even longer to get back down to the bottom. It is actually much faster to take the stairs. There are two water slides, one of which is one of the most fun water slides I've been on, the other wasn't worth the energy to get to it. We loved the hot tub that was hidden in a grotto behind a waterfall. Most people don't know it's there so it is more often than not empty. The swim up bar was fun too. Service at this hotel in general is second to none. Every person we encountered was professional without being cold (as has been our experience with other Hilton properties), eager to help without being overbearing, and everyone seemed as though they actually liked being there, which is rare. (Of course I'd be that way too if I worked in that atmosphere.). My only issue was resolved fairly quickly. During the first two days Maintenance came both days wanting to do things in the room. I appreciate the effort of keeping the hotel nice, but do these thing when someone is not checked into the room. I informed the man that we'd prefer not to be bothered by these issues while we were here and he never came back again. Word of warning: Lounges and umbrellas on the beach as well as by the pool ARE limited. The hotel enforces a policy of items being left unattended for over an hour will be removed so you'll want to at least get out of the pool once an hour and go back to your stuff. Complaints about shortages of lounges and umbrellas are generally found during times when the hotel is exceptionally busy. Plan your trip accordingly if these things are important to you, or deal with the fact that you'll have to be up with the sun to secure them. They also offer cabanas with food service and dedicated lounges so that may be an option as well. We decided that this wasn't necessary, but I can see how this would be a nice experience. This is a perfect location if you want to get away from it all and have a wonderfully romantic vacation.

If you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picture it, just think of continuous freight trains rolling past your door every 5 minutes, day and night. This continuous noise and shaking also comes from the luggage and in-room dining carts. 3. Management doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care. No return call from GM, and front desk manager has no effect. 4. Continuous maintenance on adjacent rooms both times I was here. 5. Hugely expensive drinks and food. Kind of expected, but note just a fountain coke is $7.50. 6. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect many of the restaurants to be open. 7. And the room keys. What a joke. Last time I was here I spent two days getting my door lock replaced, this trip I just get locked out every other day. 8. They actually made my paying 19 year old daughter leave the fitness center because they said she had to be at least 16 years of age. 9. The room last time was in a hole and had no view. 10. If you let the resort plan an off site excursion to include your 18 year old son, make sure he brings 3 forms of picture ID. Without it, an 18 year old, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been driving his very expensive car will not be allowed on an ATV. There is much more, but the bottom line in this review was derived from two different stays, so I am confident that Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grand Wailea Resort is a great place to get your vacation ruined.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Laurel, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Glorious Stay\u201d", "Author": "cheermom505", "ReviewID": "UR83176451", "Content": "Perfect from beginning to end.

This is a great hotel but could use a bit of polishing to come up to the service expectations of a 4-5 star resort charging $400+ per night. The location was easily found by our GPS located in the heart of the Wailea Resort area, right on the beach and adjacent to the Shops at Wailea. Upon check in, you have the option of leaving your car with the valet during your check in and till 7 pm that day. At that point you have the option of choosing free self parking or continuing with valet and paying $20. The walk to the self parking is about a 7 minute walk from the central lobby. The spots in the self parking garage are a bit small, but the Town Car that we had always fit in the spots. Though there was sometimes a shortage of spots during the day, we were always to find a spot within a few minutes. Parking in the evenings was always easy. Unfortunately they also allow some employees to park in the garage....which is unacceptable with the limited number of spots. They should be using the surface lot beyond the garage. (I actually had to tell an employee to vacate a spot....they have the option of the surface lot while I did not.) Check in was quick and easy and our luggage arrived in our room promptly. They upgraded us from a garden view to an ocean view as Hhonors Diamond members and also provided us with two free welcome cocktails in Humu, a $40 dining certificate, and waived resort fee. (waiving the resort fee was a nice touch) I am not sure if the resort fee was waived because we were on a reward stay or simply because we were Diamond members. For the second and subsequent nights we were upgraded to the Napua Tower do to some issues we experienced. There is a grand beautifully decorated lobby with concierge, front desk, bell services, and dining reservations. There is also a nice lobby bar, though we did not try it as we would prefer to be outside near the water. The bar was always empty with the exception of the night that a convention was in house. Most of the day there was a Guava juice available near the front desk which was a nice touch. The $25 per night resort fee (Yes, I feel resort fees are a scam....include it in the base rate!) includes beach lounges and umbrellas, water slides / water elevator / Tarzan swing / lazy river, towel service, local calls, coffee/tea in room, and wifi access. Initially on booking we were concerned that the hotel pool would be extremely crowded. Given we were at the resort during low season we were always able to find a lounger at the adult pool, but lounger saving was rampant at the activity pool and the staff did absolutely nothing to try and free up loungers even after hours of being unoccupied. Fortunately getting a lounger and umbrella at the beach was always easy as the county has a law that the chairs can not be unoccupied for more than 30 minutes and the beach staff sets up the chairs on request. Personally I prefer to be at the beach hearing the crashing waves. Finding space at the pool in the evening was always easy and the pool area was open till 10pm I believe. For guests staying at the adult pool, you must still go over to the activity pool to get towels and the ever popular wrist band. They have staff coming around asking to see your wrist band. It would be nice if those same people would be tasked with providing arm bands and towels at the adult pool like many other hotels do....all they would need is a simple roster of rooms or a handheld with guest data. Not a big issue but a minor thing that should seriously consider implementing. The pools and associated water effects are all great. (Though the water elevator is a one time thing, it's cool but the wait to do it is pretty long and you kind of go...hmmm, okay.) The water at the beach was calm in the mornings and still enjoyable in the afternoons when the trade winds pick up. As expected dining and cocktails on property are expensive, everything we tried was pretty good. (One of our meals in Humu was a bit over seasoned for our taste but still good) It is an easy 5 minute walk over to the Shops at Wailea for additional dining and shopping options. There is also an on property casual counter service restaurant on the way to the self parking but we did not take the opportunity to go in and check it out. There are quite a few shops in the same wing that leads to the self parking. Since we were in Kihei for Scuba or Surfing many days, we tended to do lunch in Kihei. The room we had in the Napua tower (as well as our first room) were both nearly the same. (There were a few more appointments in the Napua rooms but nothing significant as far as in room amenities). The rooms were large and quiet. Set up with a king size bed, love seat, work desk, and chair/ottoman, louvered shutters, and a nice balcony with a table and two chairs. The rooms are exactly as described on the hotel website and nicely decorated with plenty of storage and a nice bed. The rooms have an HDTV and clock radio with MP3 jack. The climate control works well and you can leave the blower motor on for white noise while the climate control is still functioning. The AC shuts off when the balcony door is open but that is fully understandable. The room had no discernable noise from nearby rooms. There is also a mini bar and counter area. You can rent a fridge for a reasonable price. We requested one but it never showed up and when we ran to the store that evening we just got a small cooler to keep our drinks cool. The bathrooms are very nice, with a separate shower and soaking tub, plenty of counter space, hamper, etc. The have plenty of toiletries on hand. There is also plenty of closet space in the rooms as well as in room safe, iron / ironing board, etc. The Napua Tower upgrade was wonderful. Though the room was basically the same, they had a concierge on staff in the tower, business center (no extra charge), breakfast (continental + 1-2 hot items), an afternoon tea hour (cookies and tea/lemonade), and an evening cocktail hour with attended bar, appetizers (hot and cold). There was plenty of seating space in the lounge area and the staff was wonderful....always willing to go the extra mile. What a great place. (But is it worth the $$$ to pay for an upgrade....you would have to decide that yourself.) Most of the staff at the hotel was excellent. Bell services was usually good, valet, front desk, and concierge were helpful. Housekeeping was always great. Two points do stand out however: One day however we came back from diving and I dropped my wife off at the valet area with the intent that she was going to get a bellman to bring the dive gear up to the room. Well 15 minutes later I am walking through the lobby and see all the bellman standing around the bell desk chatting so I went to the valet area and realized not one of them had come out to help her. SO....I got a bell cart and took it myself. While we are getting in the elevator, one of the a bellman comes over and says that we can not use the cart and \"do you want help\"....I said absolutely....he proceeds to try and take the cart back out of the elevator to bring to us later. (there is not a service elevator...they use the guest elevators so that was not the reason) ABSOLUTELY not....I told him get in or leave....he decided to leave. What a jerk...and he was one of the gaggle of them standing around the bell desk chatting. The second issue we ran into was that the louvered shutters in our room were broken. We called and asked to have them fixed that morning and low and behold 6 hours later we come back and the shutters are worse...the broken parts are missing, more louvers are missing, and the door was jammed shut. After talking to their customer service hotline multiple times over 45 minutes and telling them it was NOT a housekeeping issue they sent a housekeeper to clean up broken glass. (The housekeeper was very friendly and apologized for the hotlines error) Then they said that the blinds would be fixed because the maintenance staff was going off shift. Unacceptable. They offered to move our room but we had just unpacked. Finally after some In back and fourth banter they agreed to move us to the Napua tower....that was a nice upgrade and worth the effort to pack up and move. All in all I could have driven into Kihei gotten a tube of caulk, and fixed the shutters myself for less time than it took to demand they take care of the issues. We would have been happy staying in the original room had the problem not happened but really liked the upgrade! Based on positive reviews we decided to attend the Luau at the Grand Wailea. This Luau recently moved from another resort and we really enjoyed the show and meal. We paid a bit extra for the premium seating and were right up front. The Luau was not overly crowded so I am not sure if it was 100% worth the upgrade to premium but I think so. We were able to hit the buffet first and had a great view. The only odd thing about the Luau is the check in. They tell you to arrive during a particular window to check in....well low and behold when you get there the staff is on a union mandated break, and the guests must stand around waiting. What? Once we got into the grounds everything was great. The show was good (fire dancer!) and the food was good. It was different than the Old Lahaina Luau we attended last year. I like the show a bit better at Wailea as well as the ocean front location. The food was about the same (quality but buffet), I liked the show a bit more at Wailea. The selection of tropical cocktails was more limited than at the Old Lahaina but Wailea had more general offerings for mixed drinks and beer / malt's. I try not to be over critical of hotels, as you will seem most of my reviews are favorable. All in all this was a great stay but believe that they need to polish their service before they truly deserve a 4-5 star for service. As I mentioned, while some of the staff such as housekeeping always performed at a high level other services tended to fall short, with a few glaring failures. Given this was during off season, I wonder how the services would be during the high season! On our next stay in Wailea we will probably investigate other offerings in the area. While the pool is the central point of the hotel, and it was great.....I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they can live on the laurels of the pool. Though we were on a reward stay, I write this review from the aspect of looking at what the regular rate was during the stay and write the review from that perspective. I am so very glad we stayed and got to experience the great amenities but might look at neighboring hotels next time.

Also, unpleasent surprises came with the bill: a $25 a-day charge for use of \"resort facilities\" (tea and coffee in the room, gym, etc.). Again, these come free in all hotels of this category I've stayed so far. Finally, we mistakenly put a large beach towel into the towel bin of the hotel the first day of our stay. We called every day to see whether the towel had been recovered. Never returned our calls. Nobody took action on it. We had to leave without the towel after almost two weeks of stay. But, hey, the beach is gorgeous, swimming pools nice and hotel accomodations are first class. Mind it: you're paying for it. Also the restaurants are quite pricy and I found the food just ok. Finally, it's a little far away of where action takes place. If you like a quite beach, it's perfect. For some shopping and walking around, you've to move north. Forget about the shops at Wailea.

I know its not exactly fair to compare a different hotel chain from a different island, but we paid similar money to stay at both, with similarly nice accomodations. St Regis Kauai is head and shoulders above in terms of service, grounds upkeep, and exclusivity. You can relax there, not worry about racing for good seats, there are not 1000's of screaming children and pushy adults. I just dont know how else to describe it other than \"down market,\" which is not how a hotel in this price range should feel, in my opinion. The good: Our room was awesome, we were on the 5th or 6th floor and we were upgraded to oceanview room with terrace. Room was perfectly nice, although our couch was a bit stodgy. Otherwise an A+. Room service despite not serving 24hrs (which lets be real people at these prices and on maui, this should be available) was pretty good and we used them several times. Great views from the room. The beach was nice (if you could get on it). The pools/slides are cool. The grounds are very nice in certain areas where the original hotels grandeur has been preserved, such as the lobbys and entrance and some of the outer grounds/gardens. Its beautiful to walk around at night. There is a nice long path that runs along the hotel beach and goes past many other hotels, nice for a walk in the morning or sunset. Good snorkeling can be found near by, we swam with sea turtles and saw lots of fish. And the highlight of our trip was SHANE THE BARTENDER, WHO ROCKED . HE KNEW US BY NAME AND WELCOMED US WARMLY each time we popped by for a drink. He would remeber what we drank last and was very good. Unfortunately, he was the only one who we got this type of service from at this hotel (and in comparison, when at the st regis, there were several employees throughout the resort who knew us by name and were outgoing and friendly.) Big difference to me. The Bad: I was here 10 yrs ago, and let me tell you there has been alot of change. All these glowing reviews of this place must be from first time travelers to this hotel. If they had the priviledge to see this place in its glory, they would have a better idea of whats gone wrong with this place. The hotel itself is basically the same, except everything seems worn and dirty: pathways are dirty and falling apart in some areas, there are wood banisters in some spots that need some up keep or paint or to be redone, or something. The grandiose gardens that I came back for are not as well kept, and there are plants that are really beat up and half dying. They need to be replaced. The grass along the walkways is worn out and its dirt or yellow/dead in many places. they try to cut and paste new grass is but it just doesnt look right. The water by the restaurant on the tropical lagoon is atrocious looking, I was concerned for the fish they had in it (and in the grand scheme of things these might not be such a big deal, and I am being critical, but only because I saw the real Grand Wailea Hotel and Spa, and know how far its fallen. Several times we tried to call down to the concierge and the phone just rand and rang and rang. I spoke to several peope who are \"members\" allowing them special rates and frequent visits and they agreed that the place has taken a turn for the worse.) There is just a major vibe of corner cutting, and just maintaing what they have, to milk it for as much money as they possibly can, without investing anything more money into it. OK NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE UNPLEASANT POOL/BEACH SCENE. I love the pools at this place. However, there are just too many people on this property. WHERE DO ALL THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?!!?!?!?!?!? The management is dropping the ball here big time. Finding a free chair can be a nightmare. There are lines for towels, which are needed to claim a chair. People line up at ungodly hours to be first. They say they clear the towels off the chairs if people dont come down after an hour, but I didnt see this happen once. The pool/beach staff was not friendly at all. I was told these hotel gigs are hard to get on Maui and are well liked by the locals, apparently not! The loungers and chairs around the pools are stacked so closely there may not even be an inch between them, and in some places they go 3 or 4 rows deep. I felt like I was sitting on the expressway, in rush hour, only in a lounge chair with palm trees around me, and a melted 20 odd dollar pinacolada. And dont let them tell you they are at max capacity, because this hotel is huge and was not filled if we were getting free oceanview room upgrades. The scam here is, they built this huge condo complex (Hoelei? or something)across the street, and to get people to stay there, they allow them full access to the Grand Wailea pools and grounds. These people seem to bring kids by the dozen. Its screaming kids all day. I felt like I was at a six flags water park, not an alleged 4 star resort upscale resort. So you basically have 2 resorts worth of people on one property. NO WONDER THE PLACE IS SO OVER CROWDED. SO HERE I AM WITH MY VERY HIGH ROOM RATE AND 20$ COCKTAIL, STRUGGLING TO FIND A SEAT ANYWHERE NEAR A BODY OF WATER, WEDGED IN TRAFFIC 3 ROWS BACK FROM THE POOL AND IM STUCK BEHIND/PUSHED OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EVEN HOTEL GUESTS!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!!!!! but this is not a problem, just simply rent one of there 300 dollar a day poolside huts and you will not have to worry. Service is so so poolside. Did I mention the screaming kids yet? haha! This place has sold its soul in my opinion, I dont even want to get into the beach scene, which was actually a little better. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, wishing I had never left the st regis. I will never be back. I gave 3 stars because the grounds are still somewhat nice in comparison to most properties and the pools are still cool. If you walked around this place at night after all the cattle go back to the barn, and the darkness covers up the blemishes, its a beautiful place. We just spent alot of time off the property and hung in our room so we could have some peace and quiet. Something that there is a severe shortage of here. Do yourself a favor and go to the 4 Seasons, the Ritz or Kea lani if your coming to Maui. We were watering at the mouth walking past the Marriot Outrigger resort which is down the beach path from the GW. Things looked so peaceful and realxing and serent there. Chairs were spaced out appropriately. This place needs to lower its prices and have there 4 star rating removed. We still managed to have a great time here, but beware! Things are not the same here anymore. If we do come back we'll stay at the Marriott a few doors down or the Ritz in Kaplua or 4 seasons next door. Both looked serene and could be had for less money, except the 4 seasons. BOTTOM LINE: THE GRAND WAILEA IS A ZOO AND THE HOTEL HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE!!!! IF YOU MUST GO, IT BETTER BE DURING THE SLOWEST PART OF THE SEASON THERE. LOOK ELSEWHERE, UNLESS YOU ARE A FAMILY WITH & KIDS AND PLAN TO STAY AT THE CONDO PLACE HOELEI ACROSS THE STREET.

We even contemplated staying somewhere else after we read some of the reviews, but we are very glad we didn't give in to blind fear. With that said.... There is one word I can use to describe this resort- SPECTACULAR! As soon as we arrived we were welcomed with a warm smile and a Lei greeting for the entire family :). Check-in was a breeze and we were surprised to know that we had been upgraded to the Napua Tower, which is the Grand Wailea's Concierge building. We had a great room with breathtaking side views of the ocean. The marble bathroom was beautiful with a soaking tub and a shower big enough for 2! That day, we arrived just in time for the Cocktail hour (complimentary for Napua Tower guests). The cocktail hour consisted of unlimited cocktails, tasty Hors d'oeuvres and an array of bright and colorful Shirley Temples for the kids! Everyone we encounted was warm and friendly. The pools were awesome and our kids really enjoyed them. The water elevator is as cool as it sounds and the tarzan jump- in my son's words- was \"Out of this world!\" The ocean was gorgeous, although it would tend to be rough and choppy in the afternoons, which was the time of day we normally would be there. The impeccably manicured grounds were absolutely phenomenal, and as full as the resort was it never felt crowded. The resort had ordered more than 700 extra chairs around the pool areas to ensure the comfort of their guests, which we really appreciated because that meant that we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn to get our chairs. The food was great and their Sunday Brunch was unforgettable! The kids really enjoyed the desserts. The location is wonderful as it is next to the Shops at Wailea, which is an upscale center with stores like Louis Vuitton and Gucci and a couple of really good restaurants. We have to stress how much we appreciated the hotel's hospitality. Everyone, from the ladies who cleaned our room to the Napua Tower's Concierge staff, the bartenders, the guitar player at the lobby bar to the Executive Office staff member we met on our last day, who so warmly snapped our last family photo at the resort as we were departing. Everyone we encountered at this hotel appeared to be sincerely happy and delighted to serve us. We truly received exceptional service at the Grand Wailea and hopefully will be back soon!

We always had a wonderful time and could not wait to come back. (from the UK - long trip but we knew it would be worth it). Put simply this is still a stunning hotel in a great location with wonderful grounds and fantastic pools - but what a disapointment. However the tough economic climate has taken its toll. - The biggest problem is the pools but I will come back to that. On arrival (after 20hrs travel) I had to load our bags and take them to reception myself as nobody was available to help at that time. - No smiles on reception and then we made it to our room - which was lovely! Then we just wanted some water.- however, none in the room and no more mini bar - the mini bar was still in the room but locked (no access - they no longer offer this service due to the financial conditions I was told - however we could hire a fridge for the room at $8 / day plus delivery). So called for room service at 22:35 - \"Sorry room service stops at 22:30\" - \"All I want is some water and juice - we are all really thirsty\" - \"Go to the main bar - you can get water there\" - \"our daugher is now asleep- we don't want take her to the bar\" - \"sorry can't help you, room service is closed!\" Needless to say that was a real disapointment after looking forward to the trip for so long. Including taxes we were paying just over $400/night for the most basic room overlooking the car parks - not a problem in itself although noisy in the early morning with delivery vehicals etc - All rooms other than suites are the same size with the same facilities - its just that you can pay extra for nicer views and to be nearer to the pools etc - If I do go back again I would pay for a sea view as really you are paying for a stunning sun set view each night - priceless!. Anyway - my real disapointment was the pools (we were there for the last week in August and the first week in September)- They really are extensive and great fun. I should also say that my disapointment wasn't shared by my seven year old daughter who had a wonderful time and thought that everything was amazing. The problem that we as grown ups had was that when you stay in a top flight hotel and pay a lot of money for the rooom (plus a daily $25 resort charge) - you dont expect not to be able to find three loungers together after 10am - you also don't expect to be in a line of twenty sunbeds each literally within one inch (or less) of your neighbours lounger (three rows deep). When we had previously stayed here you could turn up at any time of the day and have a comfortable choice of loungers. However, I spoke with the towel attendent who explained that the hotel had come to an arrangement with a neighboring newely built appartment complex that gave all residents unrestricted access to the pools - They had also put up at least four times the amount of loungers to accomodate - taking up every last piece of available poolside space and this still wasn't enough. If you are tough, and can cope with stress well, and can get your family up early to secure a spot then you will have a great time although you will still be disapointed with the denisty of the beds by the pool. In summary - I will be checking trip advisor in fine detail before I consider going again - I really hope that the hotel fixes things and returns to the glory days - otherwise there are so many alternative places to go and nice hotels to stay at that offer all the positives with none of the negatives of the not quite so grand wailea.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cWow\u201d", "Author": "BetsyBPhoenix", "ReviewID": "UR81086637", "Content": "Really impressive.

The first night there, we went to the grocery to get some nibbles, drinks, etc. for our in room refrig (which was delivered immediately). We parked in the self park garage and were each carrying 2-3 grocery bags and our purses. We got lost and disoriented (this resort is huge!). My friend left me with the bags and went to look for someone to ask directions. Two very handsome and friendly gentlemen offered to assist. It turned out to be Micheal, Director of Security and Jeremy, another staffer. They not only led us to our room, they insisted on carrying the groceries in for us! The next four days were delightful with every staff member we encountered making eye contact, smiling and offering a warm greeting. Our beds were blissful and the room big and comfortable. The beach boys and gal happily set up chairs and an umbrella for us on the beach. I could go on and on... We highly recommend \"The Grand\"!

It was also a perect time because there weren't that many people there-well aside from a giant Mon A Vie conference for a few of the days we were there. We decided not to rent a car on this trip-simply because what usually happens is that the car gets parked in the parking structure the entire time and doesn't get used-so why waste the $ to have it parked the whole time! Everything of interest to us-ie shopping & dining, was within walking distance of this hotel. Our largest decision each day seemed to be whether to spend the day at the pool or spend the day at the beach-rought life I know! The main pool was great and there were no problems finding chairs or umbrellas for that matter-i was a tad bit worried because of the reviews on here regarding that and having to wake up at 7am to get a chair or umbrella-but we had no problems each day around 10am. It was also great because this hotel didn't nickel & dime you over everything-chairs and umbrellas were complimentary each day both at the pool and at the beach. The adult pool was great and even the regular pool was ok-didn't see that many kids. We did do the spa for manicures/pedicures-my polish-9 days later, is still in tact, so I thought it was worth it. Even treated my husband to one too. Regarding the food-stay away from the Breakfast Buffet there-well unless you plan on eating $28 each! worth of food for breakfast It really wasn't worth it for a hot omelet and some fruit-we just grabbed a bagel at the little bistro that was upstairs from the buffet place. Wish I could remember what the place was called-they served hot & cold items-even had boxes of cereal, fruit, sandwich meats that you could buy. I'd suggest NOT ordering lunch there-gross sandwiches :( We liked the Bistro Molokini next to the adult pool-ate there a few times for lunch and dinner. $17 chicken sandwich, $22 Lobster Sandwich, $4.50 sodas, $14 cocktails, $19 cold crab cake, $26 surf & turf, $14 calamari appetizer-some expamles of menu items We never made it to HumuHumu-the fancy restaurant there. After reading reviews from here it just didn't sound worth it. We ate a few times at the Shops of Wailea which is like 2 blocks away-Tommy Bahama restaurant was great-even though it is a chain restuarant-great happy hour & GREAT food & live entertainment out on the patio. There is also a Ruth Chris steak house and a sushi place at this outdoor mall. Ruth Chris is always great & the sushi place was just ok for us- pretty pricey for mediocre food. I also wouldn' t recommend buying sunscreen anywhere on this property-$22 for it! Go to the ABC store in the Shops @ Wailea-MUCH cheaper-ie $8 there! Same for buying macadamia nuts. There is an Italian place that serves Great Pizza and salad across from the Shops of Wailea-think it was called Matteo's-it overlooks the golf course. All you see from the street is an Italian flag waving-no name or anything-our cabbie told us about it. Monday night was 1/2 off the menu & wine too-great deal and really good pizza! The Shops at Wailea are great-your typical Louis Vuitton & Gucci were the highlights, got a few items at these stores & the sales tax is cheaper than CA-so it was a deal to us :) All in all, a great trip & we'll definitely be back!", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Grounds\u201d", "Author": "nikki721", "ReviewID": "UR80649950", "Content": "The Grand Wailea is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed at. As you drive up you realized this hotel was going to be nice. The staff welcomes you right away. The front desk was so welcoming. The only bad thing is we arrived at the hotel at 12:45 p.m. and the room was ready until 2:45 p.m. The room was very nice and had a lot of room to walk around in. The pool area was very large and clean. There were a lot of seats that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserved after 7:00 a.m. so we had no problem getting chairs together.

The buffet in the morning at the Grand Dining room is not worth the price. Mateo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right outside the resort was good for dinner and great prices.

One of them was NOT nice!! I think some previous reviewers mentioned the lack of courtesy before. When you are spending almost $400+ per night for a BASIC room, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE SMILING AND KIND!!! Not the case. The clerk did her job, but was not pleasant and never once even cracked a smile. The other clerk was very nice and accommodating and he ended up upgrading our room to an ocean view. Several other desk clerks were also very friendly, but I feel like at this level of hotel, there should be absolutely no exceptions. The Rooms: They were very spacious and pretty nice. We had a room with double queen beds. The bathroom was huge, mostly marble, and the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom and had a separate door, which I really liked. There was a large soaking tub and a separate shower with a little bench. Good water pressure and plenty of space for your things. Great little mango/honey shower gels and shampoo/conditioners. Usually, I ignore the hotel samples, but these were very nice. There was a large flat screen TV in the room and plantation shutters that kept out most of the light if you wanted to sleep in. You could also sleep with the windows open and the screen door closed, so no bugs got in. Maid service was annoying, but efficient. They just came way too early, so we had to use the do not disturb sign every day. The carpets did look like they could stand to be replaced. They weren't dirty, but again, for the price of the rooms, we expected better. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were great. I slept well every night. The hotel: The hotel is extremely ornate and has a lot of beautiful elements. Statues all over the place, flowers all over the place, they've clearly put a LOT of money into making this hotel spectacular. That being said, we went down the street to the Four Seasons to have a drink and it was sheer understated elegance. We didn't go into any of the guest rooms, but the common areas were just gorgeous and classy. While the GW is not OVERstated, we agreed that it IS stated. If we were to spend that type of money again, we would probably go to the Four Seasons. In addition, the GW property is HUGE. There is a long walk pretty much anywhere you go. I think we were pretty central to everything, but it took at least 3-5 minutes to walk anywhere. I would have hated to have had one of the less central rooms. It was mostly ok because the weather was pleasant, but at times it was just a pain in the butt. There were times when I would bring things for later just so I didn't have to walk to get back to the room. The pools: There are a ton of pools on the property, but we only used the adult pool, which was nice. There were a lot of slides all over, which would be a lot of fun for kids, but we weren't sure if there was an age or height limit and it didn't appear that they were used too much by adults, so we never used them. Never too crowded (we went the week after the Labor Day holiday) and the pool had a beautiful fountain. You could get as many towels as you liked, but they did ask for your name and room number before giving you anything. It wasn't a long process. The beach: The beach behind the pools is GORGEOUS. We had the use of free beach chairs and umbrellas while at the beach and the sand out there was just supersoft and beautiful. It's a golden color, so it's darker than what I normally see, but I got used to it very quickly. There was very little debris in the sand or the water and it made swimming in the ocean a joy. I would walk down the beach next door to the front of the Four Seasons property and enjoy the view from there. Just stunning. The spa: Spa Grande is FABULOUS!!! The facilities are great and I didn't have enough time to fully enjoy them to the extent I wanted. Think Burke Williams within a resort. There are 5 different baths with different salts, eastern and western hot and cold pools, a steam room, sauna and several other amenities. Make sure you ask for a tour of the facility so you know where everything is. And get there at least an hour before your service so you can enjoy it. If I did it again, I'd allow myself an hour and a half to two hours because I like to do repeats. They also give you a free 5 minute exfoliation if you are receiving a service. This is a great way to ensure that all of the guests are clean before they use the amenities (you are still required to shower first). I got an 80 minute massage that wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was perfectly fine and I felt extremely relaxed afterward. One thing that was REALLY annoying about the spa is that the staff was constantly walking around calling names of guests who had services scheduled. When you are trying to relax in the steam room or a bath or something, the last thing you want to hear is someone else's name repeated over and over (rather loudly, I might add). They should take a hint from Burke Williams and require folks to report to one area 5 minutes prior to their service. That way, the other guests are not disturbed. They came to get me a full 10 minutes prior to my service. I needed my 10 minutes and still made it upstairs in enough time that I had to wait for my masseuse. The food: It's extremely expensive. Extremely. We had lunch once at the restaurant closest to the Hibiscus Pool (I forget the name) and the food was very average. Definitely not worthy the price. We had dinner one night at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (named after the fish) and it was pretty good, but again, very pricey. We were having a birthday celebration and had asked for seating to see the sunset, but we didn't feel like the seating we got was optimal. In fact, when we spoke to the person making the reservation, she told us the sun set at 7:30pm when it was fully below the horizon at 6:30!! A couple of the servers were great, though, and we had fun with them. We mostly ate off property, including The Shops down the street. We really enjoyed Longhi's for breakfast and we also ate at the place next door to it (something about burgers), but didn't enjoy the food or the service nearly as much as Longhi's. One day, my friend and her dad had the $50 buffet brunch, which they said was decent. They did mention that the view from the buffet was spectacular. I went driving up a mountain instead, so I missed it. :) We also had dinner at Nick's Fishmarket, which had delicious food and stellar service and we tried Pacifico's in Lahaina (worth the 45 minute drive -- if you go, be sure to get some shaved iced from Ululani's). Our first night, we ate at Cafe Olei (sp?), which we didn't particularly enjoy. The expensive food was average to below, with a less than average atmosphere at a strip mall. It was recommended to us by the valets at the hotel. Bad choice, skip it. The concierge service: On one day, I spent over 3 hours going back and forth with the concierge about activity plans. It was my most frustrating, non-enjoyable day. I wanted to go to Road to Hana, but the people I was with didn't want to go, so the concierge (who sounded like she knew her stuff) told me there were less touristy, more spiritual things to do there. We agreed to connect an hour later and when I showed up, she was the only concierge out of 4 of them who was busy. After waiting for 30 minutes and seeing the people going nowhere, I finally asked her to call me when they were done because I wanted to get in some time in the sun. Of course, she called as soon as I settled in my lounge chair. She said I needed to come back up so she could show me some places on a map, so I headed back up. The call soon dropped and she didn't call back. When I called back, I was told she was busy with other guests. I walked up soon after and she started apologizing profusely for having to leave!!! I couldn't believe she had taken an hour break, then came back, helped other people and left without helping me!! She passed me off to another concierge who gave me incorrect directions, even though I asked her repeatedly whether she knew where she was going and told her I didn't want to drive for 45 minutes to get lost. She seemed very unsure of herself. I had to ask her a thousand questions over the course of about an hour just to get any relevant information. And guess what? I never found the location. She claimed she would send up a more detailed map, but the map she sent up was less detailed than the one she showed me at the desk!! Completely useless!! And none of them seemed to know about the black sand beach 10 minutes down the road!! I just don't get how these people can hold these jobs and know practically nothing about what's going on and where things are ... I definitely expected more from such a highly rated hotel, but I was completely disappointed.... Overall, though I enjoyed my visit, I wouldn't stay at this resort again ... it's too expensive for what you get and there are plenty of other really nice places to stay in the area.... but I will DEFINITELY be back to Maui ... it's awesome!!!", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, California", "Title": "\u201cMixed Feelings\u201d", "Author": "sckim41", "ReviewID": "UR79588072", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there for a week from and we loved it there, especially the pool and spa.

We were not going to stay here at first we were going to stay in Ka'anapali my husband travels all the time and is a Hilton Honors member and he wanted to stay here. So we rebooked our hotel to the Grand Wailea. OMG what a hotel. It is all marble and has so much art work in it. It was amazing. The valet parking was excellent and Erik B. the head valet was very nice and always asked if he could help us with anything. Gave us great places to get groceries and if we wanted to know where to go, where to eat he was always willing to help. He knew my husbands name the second time we saw him and would always say, \"Mr. B how are you today? Where are you going? Have a great day!\" It was very personal and was nice to be reconized. Our daughter liked the pools, but would have liked to see a lap pool. Only because she is a competive swimmer and wanted to do laps. Otherwise they were nice. The pool area was always crowded but we were able to always find chairs. Some people had towels on the chairs before 6am as my husband was always up and we had a Deluxe Ocean View room so had a view of the pool too and he said the towels were always out there before he was. Not sure how that was possible as pools did not open until 7am? I would think that they would pull all the towels before opening pool so people who were there could get the first seats by the pool. The ones that put down towels would not show up until later.....not sure how that worked either as there is supposedly a 60 minute time limit if you are not there they are to remove your stuff. I only saw that happen on Saturday and later in the morning. My daughter and I did the spa, that was nice but I would not say it was any nicer than any of the other spa's have been to. We did have good service and they offer alot of stuff. Food was really expense there but it was expense everywhere on the island. We ate at Humuhumu 2 times once for our anniversary. It is very spendy but the food was excellent. Our server the first time was not anything to write about but the second time was excellent. The rooms are not very sound proof. We had a screaming child on the one side of us and every morning before 6am he would be carrying on for hours while we tried to sleep. It was really annoying and one night it was around midnight.

As I do, it brings back such good memories. My family and I travel quite a bit and we depend on Tripadvisor to guide us. I am always thankful to those who write reviews that are helpful which is why I try to do the same when I return. I've learned over the years to take the negative reviews with a grain of salt because some people you just can't please. My husband, son 11 yr., nephew 12 yr. and I traveled to Maui from Honolulu. We were only here for 2 nights, but they were well worth it and left us wanting more. We stopped at the K-mart on the way from the airport and got snacks and drinks to take with us. Prices maybe slightly higher than at home. We also stopped and got lunch at the Burger King before we continued on. We had a fantastic time at the Grand Wailea Resort. When we first planned our trip to Hawaii someone suggested we should do more than one island since we were traveling so far. Boy are we glad we did! When we stepped out of the car we were greeted with flower leis. When we arrived our room wasn't ready, so they allowed us to check our bags and start enjoying the property. Guest services was always very helpful, although oftenbusy, but still the wait was not that long even when there was a line. They serve you juice while you wait and the views from there are great too. We are Hilton members and got a coupon for a free bottle of champagne and $40. off dinner. Join before you go. The staff was always smiling, courteous, and helpful. The lobby area is beautiful with a lot of great art work. The resort is huge, but we had a friendly bellman that gave us a good tour and orientation on the way to our room. We loved our room overlooking the Chapel. The Chapel was a nice cool place to sit and get away from the hustle and bustle. I got some great pictures of the chapel reflected in the pond surrounding it. (I will try and add them later) We could still see a beautiful ocean view and the sun rising/setting from our room which was spectacular. Our room was spacious enough for the 4 of us with 2 queen beds. The beds were extremely comfortable and we all slept like babies. We had a nice size balcony to sit on with chairs and a table. The bathroom is huge and nicely decorated. Although, it was spring break, it was quiet in our building. The resort was packed, but we wouldn't have known it once we were in our room. Take the time to walk the grounds and the beach. Walking from the resort on the path to the left as you face the ocean you pass by some amazing houses and get some wonderful views, there is another little beach cove along the way about a 10 min walk. There is a path to the right which takes you pass what looks like condos. Stunning views everywhere you look. I walked these paths a few mornings when it was quiet before there was more foot traffic. We loved the easy access to the beach and close proximity to the beautiful pool with rapids, Tarzan rope swing, water elevator, lazy river and water slides. The kids loved it. All of us enjoyed the cave and waterfalls. The pool staff and security does a great job of making sure everyone has a good time. Our housekeeper was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. All of our requests were handled promptly. If you want to continue your fitness routine, don't miss the gym, the facilities at the GW are great. The equipment is state of the art with lots of cardio/weight equipment, each with its own video monitors. We only snacked at the pool one day. We got hamburgers and pina coladas (adult and kid versions) which were good but could be expensive to do every day. We used the self parking lot (which was a quite a walk from our room) but you pass by some great scenery while walking, so we didn't mind. We were always able to find a space. The valet parking was a little expensive for us. There are marble terraces and fountains everywhere. There are a lot of little gazebo with benches where you can sit and enjoy some quiet. The property is meticulously manicured and has a true local island flavor. There is an artificial sandy beach which is good for kids/adults who aren't up for the the strong currents on the real beach. My son and nephew loved the water trampoline. The guy that runs it is very nice. We bought a ticket for them to use it for the day, but they didn't really use it that much, so he let them use the rest of their time the next day. We only snacked at the pool one day. We got hamburgers and pina coladas (adult and kid versions) which were good, but could be expensive to do every day. We asked at guest services and got the name of several nice restaurants. We also tried the Outback Steakhouse about a 15 min drive from the resort headed back towards the airport. Went to the farmer's market http://mauiopenmarket.com We found some great deals on souvenirs and fresh fruit. We all golfed at a country club (a place whose name escapes me). The grounds were beautiful and a lot fun! I don't think you can go wrong with any of the courses. All in all we enjoyed our stay in Maui and at the GW.

We had heard many nice things about the hotel in the past, but we believe ever since Hilton has acquired the hotel it has really gone down hill.

BTW, the hotel is overcrowded because they sold membership to the locals and other neighboring properties during the economic downturn. There seems to be aggressive tension by the pool. Wonder why. If you are looking to relax, you won't. If you are looking for the best food, go next door (the four seasons).

First of all - late April and early May are a great time to be in Hawaii - when we were here the resort was only about 60% occupied so many of the reviews we read about crowds did not apply. That aside - this is a beautiful place. The beach is amazing, it didn't rain once the entire time we were there, and you get the feeling of being in a palace. I would describe it as the ultimate Maui resort. The spa simply can not be missed - there is nothing else like it in the world and they run some great specials via Hawaiian Airlines. We had the one hour Terme', hour couples massage, body scrub, and lunch at the Molokini for $299. Very reasonable considering normal prices. The rooms are great - we had a deluxe ocean view on the 8th floor right near the Napua Tower - wonderful furnishings, amazing bathroom, etc. The only downside.....it's operated by Hilton and you can tell. We had come here from the Grand Hyatt in Kauai and as far as the service and details, the Grand Wailea could learn alot from the GH. For the cost of staying at the Grand Wailea there are some areas they need to improve....Service is spotty - a good example is that the valets and bellmen were so friendly when we arrived, but the lady at the front desk was about as nice as a snake. The grounds are nice, but not especially well maintained - dead plants, litter, etc. The place is starting to look a bit tired. And the worst thing of all that absolutely shocked me given the cost to stay there.......the corridors that run to all of the guestrooms are ceramic tile and the housekeeping staff begins running these carts down the corridors at a pretty early hour that are SO noisy!!! We aren't late sleepers and we were SO annoyed by this!! It's really really bad!! The bartenders at all venues were a BLAST! Happy hour in the Botero Bar was a daily event. Likes: Location, beach and the beach chairs and umbrellas that are included in the resort fee, pools (all are so great!), HUGE bathrooms, wonderful beds, great lanai outside of the rooms, beautiful setting, Incredible Spa.

There werent a lot of pool chairs available but the pool itself never seemed crowded. My kids had to wait about 2 minutes to do the rope swing, 5 minutes for the water elevator and maybe 5 minutes for the largest water slide. The defiinitely do NOT enforce a saving seats policy. I watched about 10 chairs around our cabana stay with only towels and a magazine on them for about 3 hours before the people decicded to show up. The Spa was amazing. It is about $150 for a massage but it is actually a two hour treatment. You check in one hour before and use their baths and other relaxing amenities before your treatment. The kids massage i not worth it. It was $100 for each of my children for a $25 minute massage and they do nto get to use any of the baths or relaxing areas so for them it really is just a 25 minute thing. If you are looking for low carb food options do not eat at humhumu--- least accomadating. However, if you are set on it call ahead and ask for the secluded table for 6 that sits on its on little island like circle. Even though self park is free--- there were never any spots so we had to valet. I thought the rooms were great. When you travel with kids you pray for 2 queens instead of 2 doubles-- they have queens. OR my parents had a conencting room with a king and the king had a sofa pull out my kids could have slept on. If you get 2 queens, request extra pillows before you arrive otherwise you will only get 2 pillows on each bed. Longhi's had a great breakfast--- we didn't discover it til day 3 so we ate the buffet at the hotel the first two days-- not all that great.

So many things to try and hot/cold tubs, massaging showers, scrub down. First of all when we checked in for our honeymoon. We had to wait a long time before we were helped or even greeted. A woman was complaining about her bill for at least 10 minutes.Nice to be greeted after getting off the plane. Finally another front desk girl helped us. We told her we were on our honeymoon and asked for a suite, however the hotel was completely booked. We asked for a refrigerator in our room ahead of time. And paid for it upfront. We received a refrigerator in our room, however after a day of having our drinks in the refrigerator we noticed that the temperature was on the coldest setting. And our drinks were still slightly cooler than room temperature. My husband contacted the front desk before we were about to leave in the morning to go out for the day. 8/4/10- believe it was. We came back to our room and there was a roll away bed. We were on our honeymoon, so we surely didn't ask for it. My husband called and asked to get a new refrigerator, I called the front desk and talked to Carolina.. Time went by 30 minutes and so I decided to go down to the front desk. I spoke to Carolina and she said it had been taken care of. I asked her to see if we were charged for the bed and she said no right away without checking and didn't seem to care attitude. I waited a little while later, I called Carolina and she said she would have the manager call us. a few minutes later we finally got our new fridge, I was so angry that I told the gentleman that delivered the fridge we waited at least 45-60min. he apologized and told us the front desk had told him the incorrect room number 2 floors from our room. No call from the manager. So I called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. Spoke to Roberto?

Did I mention most of the Durst clones were sloppy drunk at the pool by 1PM? A true Durster wouldn't even get up until 1PM.

Along with a treatment comes use of the fitness center (including one class) and use of the Terma Baths. The Terma Baths themselves are a wonderful and unique experience - 5 different warm baths filled with things like Red Lava & Guava, Vanilla & Black Lava, etc. Definitely worth the experience! Here are some other glimpses of our experience; hope it is helpful if you choose to spend time at the Grand Wailea Spa! 1) Give yourself ample time to find the Fitness Studio where Boot Camp (and the other classes) were held. It took me, my cousin, and one other seeker about 10 minutes of walking around the racquetball court & spa area to find it. (And that, too, only after we asked an employee who had no idea but knew enough to bring us back to the spa area so we could ask them) 2) The woman who teaches the classes is GREAT - friendly, informative, and very very fit! Unfortunately, the room itself is awful - absolutely NO ventilation! No windows, no air, no nothing. Brace yourself for that and bring plenty of your own water. 3) The fitness center teacher (her name escapes me at the moment) encouraged my cousin & I to stay for a 2nd class. So we decided to try to push our spa treatment appointments back an hour. That's where the fun began. We went to the Spa front desk area and were told that since we had already \"checked in\" and made our payment, the system wouldn't let them change our appts. (huh?) We were referred to a woman at a different desk. We re-explained our simple request. 2 phone calls later and she, too, concluded \"Sorry, I don't think we can do that....well, I suppose I can try calling up there\" (Okayyyyyy, yes, please do that....) Another few minutes tick by and we are referred back to the front desk lady, to whom we have to once again explain what we are trying to do. Mind you, we were very polite and repeatedly offered to stick with the original appointments if there was no availability for later appts. This is where it gets even funnier. We were told that there seems to be space available, \"but no one inside is answering the phone, so.....\" <insert apologetic look> (Okayyyyyyyyy...) At this point, we decided to forgo the class and proceed with our treatments. Once \"inside\", I asked the attendant if she wouldn't mind checking if we could push our appts. She was utterly confused by this simple request as well (but very very nice nonetheless). Shortly thereafter, another woman appeared who fortunately understood our request clearly, and within 2 minutes, changed our appts and sent us back to the fitness studio. Success! (albeit with a lot of effort, and 15 minutes late to class, but still....!) 4) Once inside the spa.... Everyone was pleasant enough, but next time I will be a bit more insistent on getting a tour/lay-of-the-land before entering. E.g. what are these European baths and can I use them? What are these Auto-showers and should I be using them between termas? What about the Steam Room? Is that something I can/should use before or after my treatment? before/after the termas? Lots of questions and every time I politely asked the attendant, I'd get a friendly but rather uninformative \"yes/no\" answer. 5) The treatment itself (Seaweed Wrap by Devri) was wonderful; she was very professional, the room was relaxing, and the overall experience was very pleasant.

Facility: Every bit as beautiful as the website! The property is huge - it took about 10 minutes to get to our room at the end of the furthest building, but it was worth it. Ornate with attentive staff everywhere. Room: Roomy and comfortable. We had a 4th floor room with a balcony overlooking the water park. It was quiet and we were well cared for by the staff. Nothing escaped their attention. Dining on site is pricey (scone/coffee/fruit for 2 at the Cafe Kula coffee shop = $28 while dinner at Humu restaurant = $125). It's a less at the mall just a short walk away. Activities: Beach, pool, and water park - all were fun. There is an adult pool by the bar and a number of family pools around an outdoor dining area. Beach cabanas are avail for $300/day, covered chairs along the beach are $75 (3rd party vendor), while umbrella/umbrella set up on the beach is free. Spa and 2 level fitness center are top notch. In the back of the hotel there is a running trail paralleling the beach. It crosses several other hotels and goes into residential areas. Be aware it is narrow and gets very crowded by 7am. Maui isn't our favorite island, but this hotel made the trip one of the most relaxing ones I've been on. Advice: If there is anything you think you've forgotten, there is a Wal-Mart and Costco five minutes from the airport. Wailea is another 30 minutes away. Once you get there (Wailea) you may not want to leave :) This is your first opportunity to stock up on alcohol cheaply. Invest in a small, collapsible cooler. You can fill it with ice, snacks, and drinks for day outings. I got a lunch pail size one for $5 and even brought it back home when done. Kihei: Everything is downright affordable and fun if you get out onto Kihei Road (5 minute drive) and discover unique restaurants in Kihei (the chief valet gave us great recommendations). We found it best to hit the grocery store in Kihei for fresh fruit and baked goods for breakfast as well as snacks/drinks for afternoons or beach or outings. The same goes for alchohol, sunscreen, swim gear etc. The beaches are so-so. Molokini: This beautiful crater rim island was mentioned on Travel Channel and was on my bucket list to snorkel, but I was disappointed. The tour started at 8am, it took an hour to get there and there were a lot of other boats there were equally as many people. I saw only 2-3 different types of fish despite cool, clear water. Don't waste your money. Find a good nearby reef (like Turtle Town just south of the hotel) and hang out there. Parking: Valet is $20/day. Free parking but fills up early in the morning. Although it took us a long walk to get to our room (near the Humu restaurant), our room was steps away fr the free parking area so it made getting to/from our car very convenient. Surprise: We got a modest daily resort fee, but it covered parking, towels, and internet access. Unlike Oahu where those are separate charges.

We had the Sunday brunch on Father's Day which was awesome ( not cheap though!). The restaurants and lounges were very nice, we especially liked the lobby bar, although I wish the bar/restaurant nearest the adult pool had later hours. We had a great dinner at the Humuhumunukunukuapua restaurant ( say that three times real fast !) aka The Humu with a nice view of the ocean. With the Four Seasons next door and some nice restaurants at The Shops at Wailea within walking distance you also have some other dining options if you choose. Our room was spacious and clean with a nice sized balcony which overlooked the lower part of the resort and the ocean. We did get a visit from a baby lizard (a gecko I assume, even though he didn't try to sell me insurance) which I think snuck in when housekeeping dropped something off. It was kind of funny because when I opened the door after catching the little darling in a glass, the mommy was waiting outside for junior to return! They do charge you $25 if you want a fridge for the stay. As with most resorts we've stayed at, you have the pool chair circus with people lining up before 7 AM to snag their spots. If you don't have kids, the adult pool always seemed to have plenty of open chairs. We rented a car and the self parking garage is a bit small and spaces were at a premium even though the resort did not seem to be very crowded. If you have a handicap sticker you'll find plenty of spaces though!

Our booking was screwed up so we were offered free room upgrade that was on our confirmation email. At check in, they claimed no such upgrade was part of reservation. We had to go to the business center to print out reservation that showed upgrade on eamil. We were charged 10 bucks for this. Then when we showed front desk, they made process too difficult to even deal with it. There were lines for all water slides. Very difficult to get lounge chairs even when hotel not that full. It seems they create false demand for shade and chairs to charge $300 for place to sit by pool in a cabana. Luau was a joke. We stood in multiple lines for hours for bad food and amatuer show.

Bottom line if you don't have kids, stay at the four seasons for the money. If you have kids, book a two day stay for the slides at most . Then move to Four seasons.

I can not express enough what a wonderful time we had. The room was spacious and had all the necessary amenities to enhance our stay. My kids, 10 & 12 are still talking about the Tarzan Swing, Water Slides and Water Elevator. My wife on the other hand enjoyed a message by the adult pool. During one of the evenings, I noticed that a group was having a private Luau on the beach. What a spectacular setting, over looking the ocean with the sun setting. Even though Arizona is known for it sunsets, there is no comparison to what I experienced in Maui! The service at the hotel was outstanding, from the pool service to the front desk. As I had mentioned, being in the industry, sometimes I can be a little demanding. Not once did anyone say no or even give me a reason to think twice. Upon check-out, we needed to vacate our room due to a large group checking in. Since our plane did not depart until 10:30PM, the front desk clerk suggested that we enjoy the pool facilities and than come back to the desk and they would give us a hospitality room to change.

It's perfect for swimming and hanging out. You can rent kayaks to take out on the ocean if you'd like or just hang out on a complimentary lounge chair and umbrella that the resort offers. The staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating. I surprised my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 with a cabana dinner offered by bistro molokini. To elaborate on the \"very accommodating\" part of my review, bistro molokini just happened to be closed for dinner when I was there but opened up just for us! A cabana dinner on the water is truly an experience that you would never forget. We also ate at the Humu restaurant for dinner and that was an incredible experience as well. The restaurant itself sits on top of a fish pond so and ambiance is really remarkable. We stayed in a deluxe ocean room which was absolutely amazing. The views we had were breathtaking. We could see the sunset every night from out room if we wanted to. It was extremely clean and everything was top of the line. Not to mention the bed was probably the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on! I would suggest walking around the resort a few times during the day and at night to take in the sites and smells of this resort. If you've ever been inside a florist before and smelled the fresh flowers there, that's pretty much the entire resort.

I'm not sure about the women's side but the men's side has a Roman, Japanese, and Hawaiian style relaxation pools in the spa.

Because of our \"near perfect\" experience at the Grand Wailea Resort during one of our annual family vacations, my wife and I decided not to second guess another location, but rather choose a \"proven performer\". Wow!!!!! Our second trip to this resort exceeded all of our expectations that we all experienced a few years ago with the entire family. From the time you pull up in your car to the time you leave the property, you begin to realize that you have truly walked into \"Paradise\"! A beautiful waterfall of sight and sound, a warm lei gretting, and a carefree check in and baggage delivery to our room set the entire tone of our next few days at this property. Nothing but smiles and warm greetings from the entire staff from check-in to the towel desk at the the pool-everyday!!!! Cleanliness of the room and property were exquisite and the bed made it sometimes impossible to get up in the morning for our daily plan of walking along some of the most beautiful seashore that we have ever walked on. If you are fortunate enough to book an oceanview room, sitting on your Lanai during the afternoon or evening is just spectacular! Whether enjoying breakfast at the Cafe or at the Grand Buffett, the food quality and selections were excellent. Lunch and dinner played the same way with either an open air atmosphere at the Bistro Cafe or fine dining at the HumuHumu Restaurant with some of the most spectacular views of the blue Pacific Ocean and the golden fire-orange sunsets. Bring your cameras to dinner!!!! Congratualtions to the entire staff and management at the Grand Wailea for their secret formula in making everyone feel like you truly have stepped into \"Paradise\".

It is a HORROR show - the likes of which I have not encountered in Florida, California, the entire Carribbean (including Atlantis in the Bahamas) or the entire East Coast in the summer. The hotel management is non- existent. Pay your $$$$$$$ and they could care less if you have no place to sit by the pool or the beach! And if you arrive after 7 am - you will NOT have anyplace to sit. This is not a relaxing vacation - honestly there is less stress fighting your way on to the NYC or Japanese subway systems. As the prior reviewer said - if you leave your chair for an hour - they remove your items and give away your chair. I noticed a LOT of this on our last day - there was one security guard who was especially agressive and seemed to be enjoying himself. As I watched, I thought - wow I've been on beaches in the Dominican Republic that were ringed with armed guards from the military toting machine guns and felt more relaxed. At least those guards were actually protecting me and my stuff! One striking thing I will remember also is that around the pool - no one ever seems to smile. Not the guests and not the staff. Pretty odd for a \"vacation paradise.\" I heard that there is some type of condo or time share property adjoining this hotel. These folks pay little $$ to rent their rooms but have full privileges to the pool and beach. As a result - the hotel has a huge overcapacity of people v. the facilities available. Couple that with the fact that 40% of the pool and beach cabanas are reserved (for a tidy $250-$300 per day extra to the hotel) by other guests when they book their rooms (a fact NO ONE ever mentions when you are booking) and you have the root of the problem. Adding insult to injury - many of the \"reserved\" cabansa sit empty if not for the entire day - for much of it. So people who know the system can just plunk down their $$, tour the rest of Maui and laugh at the hotel guests who would just like a seat to unwind by the pool. As I said - the most ridiculous pool scene I have encountered world wide. If you are no looking to use the pool or the beach and/or you go at a time other than Thanksgiving, Xmas or Spring Break, the property itself is gorgeous - as is the room.

At the Grand Wailea, we did have drinks by the beach bar (name escapes me at the moment) and the apps were awful and the \"house\" wine was undrinkable. If you must stay in Waliea - definitely check out the Four Seasons. Their property is much more elegant (even if their mortgage seems to be in default - doesn't seem to have trickled down to the property at least not yet).

Crisp bacon, waffles, yogurt parfaits, and every kind of tropical fresh fruit. Servers would offer us a newspaper, they were very attentive, and this relaxation is part of the reason we come to the Grand Wailea. Didn't eat at Bistro Molokini or Humu's this time around, but previous visits to Molokini have been tasty. -Pools: To be honest, this is the main reason we come back to the Grand Wailea! Yes, I am almost 30 years old, and yes I don't have kids but I still love the waterslides! The pool is so tranquil in some spots, and raucous (fun) in others. We have always been able to find a lounge chair, we love the frozen drinks that they serve you poolside (even though they're pricey) and we love to get hot in the Maui sun and then race each other down the slides. If you have kids or are just a kid at heart (like us) then you'll LOVE the activity pool at the GW. Can't say much about the Hibiscus (adult) pool because we never go in it! We will sometimes sit in the jacuzzis at night, and the temperature has been pleasantly warm. -Grounds/Beach: Beautiful landscaping, lush greenery, plumeria everywhere. I just love walking around the GW and admiring the reflecting pools, the artwork, the gorgeous flowers. This place always takes my breath away. Beach is large, clean, and pretty quiet. We spend a lot of time in the pools, but this time around also did some snorkeling. The snorkeling was better in Kaanapali at Black Rock, but it was still worthwhile in Wailea. -Surrounding Wailea area: We always go over to the Shops at Wailea to browse and window shop. You can easily walk there from GW, but we usually drove. I recommend the Cheeseburger Island Style place, it had good made-to-order burgers, and it was nice to sit in the open air restaurant and just kick back. They have some high end boutiques (Louis Vuitton, Gucci) as well as souvenir and sundries shops (ABC Stores) so there truly is something for everyone. We love the Grand Wailea and would come back in a heartbeat. It is an expensive trip, but I feel like it is worth the money, and we will be back again!", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mercer Island, Washington", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing for price; uncomfortable\u201d", "Author": "MikeBlas", "ReviewID": "UR61023915", "Content": "At a Waldorf property, we expected a five-star experience. We were disappointed. The hotel has nice views (but what hotel in Maui doesn't?) but is absolutely giant; it is a lot like a strip casino in Vegas. One night, we decided to stay in. We ordered room service at 630 and were told it would take an hour to deliver our order -- two Caesar salads, one with chicken. The food arrived in about 50 minutes, but the salads were terrible. Both featured hard bitter romaine lettuce hearts. Two salads for $45 total where were only half edible. Can you imagine? Two mornings we tried to sleep in. On Mondays, the staff mows the lawn about 9am. On Thursday, there was a test of the fire alarm and emergency PA system at 10am. I understand that maintenance is required and tests of life safety systems are important, but so early in the morning at a five-star resort? Most other mornings, we were woken by staff moving luggage carts over the tiles in the hallway. The hard wheels on the luggage carts make an incredible amount of noise on the five-inch tiles outside the rooms, which reverberates through the rooms. Remarkably, the hotel uses phenolic wheels on their carts instead of softer pneumatic wheels. Missing details like these sound trivial until you can't sleep in on what's meant to be a relaxing and romantic getaway. I don't mind paying more for great service and good food. But the marginal service wasn't worth the prices. Most of the employees were very courteous and attentive, but the hotel is simply too big for its own good. There isn't enough room at the pools; the bars are too small, and the situation with lounges at the pool is chaotic. Renting a cabana costs almost as much as renting a room. The staff can't keep up with cleaning the facilities or stocking the bars; can't keep up with waiting tables, clearing lounges, or advising customers. Some members of the overworked staff end up rude and stressed, of course. The only casual dining restaurant in the place had a terrible waitstaff, though the bar staff in the central lobby bar was very friendly and tolerant. I'd recommend staying at a smaller property where the staff is better equipped to handle your requests, able to provide more personal service, and the facilities aren't so over-taxed.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very expensive, tons of people, best pool around\u201d", "Author": "PackersFanCleveland", "ReviewID": "UR60875341", "Content": "The Grand Wailea is one of the grand dames of Wailea and after going there it is easy to see why it has such an amazing reputation. However, reputations are built on the past and given how crowded the hotel /pool was and how relatively low staffed the hotel was I would say that the GW is past its prime. The last time I stayed at a $700 per night hotel I don't recall having to line up at 6:30am just so I could sprint to get a beach/pool chair but that is the case at the Grand Wailea. If you are not in line by 6:30 you better plan on sitting on the beach with no chair because for some reason the hotel has chosen to make getting a pool chair a full contact sport. Oh, and don't leave your pool chair unattended for more than an hour or they will scoop up your stuff and give away your chaise to someone else. The stupidest thing I have ever seen at a hotel unless you consider the Motel 6 to be a fair comparison. I guess the reason they get away with this is that the GW is an awesome hotel with the absolute best position on the best beach with the best pools I have ever experienced. So...take the good with the bad and decide for yourself what is most important: pampered luxury a few doors down (Four Seasons), Smaller pool and 50 yard walk to the beach but certainly less crowded and less expensive (Marriott) or the mack daddy pool in the mack daddy location while fighting hordes of visitors for a coveted chaise at the pool (Grand Wailea).", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cQuite a disappointing experience.

We have two kids ages 5 and 6. We are easy going, physically fit people who enjoy playing with our children and spending time outside. Here are the pros and cons of this hotel: Pros: 1-Great location... the other parts of the island had several days of very high winds. The beach at the Grand Wailea had winds, too, but we could still swim in the ocean and play on the beach. It was still warm and nice. 2-The pool has many things for kids to do. There is something for everyone. 3- The workout facilities were great. Cons: 1- Upon check in our room was still dirty from the people who stayed there before us. when we complained, they did fix it and said they'd comp our breakfast. 2- We went to the Grand Buffet for the \"comped\" breakfast, ate and left. It was not grand at all for over a hundred dollars. Then, the breakfast charge appeared on our hotel bill and stayed instead of being \"comped\" as we were told it would be. Toward the end of the trip it still did not come off until we went down to talk to someone. They still would not take it off until my husband started to get very mad and there was a line of people waiting to check in. Then they took it off. If you stay at this hotel we recommend going next door to the Four Seasons for breakfast. Their buffet was much more impressive with a lot more choices for the same price as that at the Grand Wailea 3- The hotel hallways are filthy. The carpet is just nasty, not just old, but nasty dirty. There was the same dirty half empty cocktail glass accompanied by an empty plastic juice bottle that sat on the console table by the elevator for 3 straight days before someone cleaned it up.... and that is just getting started.... 4- It takes a very long time to walk back to your room if you forget something because the place is so big. 5-They don't have nearly enough pool chairs or beach umbrellas to accommodate. We witnessed fights over the chairs and you have to get up and get in line at 7 am to get your chair and then wait until 8 when the umbrella's stand opens and tip someone to carry it out to the beach for you unless you want to do it yourself. The only people who get \"poolside\" service for beverages and food are those who \"rent\" the cabanas. Cabanas cost extra. ALL others must walk up to the poolside cafe/bar and stand in that line to get their own drinks and food and carry them back to the pool spot or beach spot they are sitting. And it is crazy at that place. 6- the pool water was cloudy every day that we were there. It did not look the way a pool should look. 7- The \"family\" bathroom did not lock when we were there-Easter week... I was walked in on two different times when I was in there with our kids, a boy and a girl. Also, there is only 1 family bathroom. For a hotel this size it is not enough in my opinion especially when single people with no kids go in the family bathroom because they don't want to wait in the line at the men's or women's bathrooms right next door. 8-The hotel staff takes down the chairs at the beach to put them away before 6 pm. So if you plan to watch the sunset on the beach you won't be able to sit in a chair while your kids play in the sand to do that. 9-If there is a little wind at the beach, the hotel staff doesn't just put down the umbrellas until it stops, they take them down and take them away for the rest of the day. A baby was taking his nap at the umbrella next to me and they still took down the umbrella and left him with no shade. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon...... 10- When we were there the hotel pool deck did not get cleaned off. It was slimy and gross the whole time. In addition to the debris floating int he pools, and the cloudy pool water, we saw debris floating in the hot tub and were not sure if it was something from a coconut tree or poop. The pool was not very clean. 11-The women's restroom by the pool smelled horrendous the entire time we stayed at the hotel. It was not maintained during the day, I don't know if it was at night or not, but anytime I used it during the day whether it was first thing in the morning or not, it was ridiculously dirty and smelled like urine. 12- I made an appointment for a pedicure and manicure at the \"grand spa\". The appointment was supposed to be for 2 pm on the Saturday before Easter. I had asked them to write it on a card because they seemed very distracted and casual about the appointment when I made it. It was a good thing I asked them to write it on a card because the next day when I was supposed to be there for my appointment they told me I didn't have one. Then, when I showed them the card they couldn't have been nicer but told me it was for noon in the computer not 2 pm like they told me and wrote down on the card. Unbelievable. They were booked and the only time they could get me in was Easter Sunday morning at 9 am. We went to church so I said no thanks. 13-Another thing about the pool- if you swim later in the afternoon don't forget to get a towel. The towel stand closes promptly at 6 pm. If you are swimming with your kids after that and didn't get a towel right away, you will have to walk through the lobby all the way to your room in your suits dripping wet. 14- Another thing about the food- we paid 30 dollars for 2 kids' meals at the pool side bar/restaurant. The kids' meals were a hot dog (or other choice of main entree), a small bag of oreo cookies, a jello cup, a bag of chips and a capri sun. The capri suns were served warm all 4 times I got my kids a kids' meal. The jello was not jelled. It was like it sat in the sun from another kid's meal and liquified or something until it made it back to the lunch shack and got put in our bucket. This happened all the times we got kids' meals for our kids at the pool. One time, I first waited 15 minutes in line to order the food. Then, was rudely told by the bartender, the kitchen was really \"backed up\" and it would be a 1/2 hour until they'd be ready. So, I came back 1/2 hour later and there was still a long line. In short....we were disappointed. We did visit other hotels in the same beach area to compare food, cleanliness and pool and service. But mainly we visited the other hotels just to get out of the Wailea to eat. There was no comparison. The Grand Wailea is not grand and it is dirty inside and out at the pool. For the same money you could go to the Four Seasons, the Fairmont or even the Marriot. Their pools were not cloudy, their staff was all friendly and the food was much better. For a 100 dollars for breakfast you want it to feel like 100 dollars. The four seasons breakfasts felt like 100 dollars, at least. Grand Wailea was not only dirty, but it was old and worn. It was not worth the money. I would not recommend this hotel, and we will never go there again.

We stayed at the GW for four nights and left on Easter Sunday. Since it was Spring break the resort was sold out and except for the pool area it didn't feel overly crowded. The only problem we encountered was that the pool area was so busy that you had to wait in line for drinks and it was difficult to find a place to sit down. We quickly figured out that we needed to be at the pool at 7:00 AM in order to get a recliner. A few weeks earlier we tried to reserve a cabana but they were reserved for this time several months earlier. After waiting 30 minutes to get a drink at the main pool lunch bar we realized the best place to order drinks was from Richard at the swim up bar. The Humu restaurant was good but for the price we enjoy more Nicks at the Kea Lani and the fine dinning spots at the Four Seasons. The resort is huge so be prepared to walk and dig deep into your wallet. After a few Lava Flows, it won't hurt as much. The rooms are large and have comfy beds and a walk in shower.

We did and of course, the people came back, enraged, looking for a fight. I don't really use lounge chairs anyway. But every day that I was there, I saw at least 2 lounge chair fights. Weird.

Positives: The pools are magnificent and there is something for everyone. There is a wonderful quiet adult pool with restaurant/bar service. There is a fun zero depth entry pool with sand for the kids, and a large pool for games with meandering rivers, slides, and a water elevator for fun. There are hidden hot tubs and a grotto swim up bar. Depending on your mood, you can find it all. The \"fun\" pools do have a lot of children, but the beach and the adult pool do not. The beach is beautiful with golden sand and warm and inviting water. Bring your binoculars so that you will have a better view of the whales. There is chair and umbrella service at the beach, however, you cannot get drink/bar service at the beach as ALL beaches in Hawaii are public property. The rooms are huge (we were in the Napua Tower,) including the bathrooms. Amenities are plentiful including coffee and toiletries. The bathrooms have a very large tub, double sinks, huge walk-in shower, and separate water closet. Slippers and robes are provided. The beds are comfy and double-sheeted which I always consider a bonus. There were extra pillows and blankets in the closet so you do not have to call for them! The lobby is open-air with marble floors and plenty of places to sit and relax. The art work is unusal and interesting. The lobby bar is large with wonderful entertainment each night. The area is clean and safe with wonderful restuarants within walking distance or within a short drive. A fantastic beach trail fronts the hotel and affords a wonderful walk either in the morning or evening. The shopping in the hotel itself is spectacular with top brands (swimsuits and clothing for men and women.) If you stay in the Napua Tower, you feel very secure as a key is needed to enter the floor. Breakfast is wonderful with all the usual continental dishes in addition to a hot egg dish of some kind or waffles. Coffee is wonderful and plentiful. The evening cocktail hour is nice with full bar service and good appetizers. You could make a meal out of the evening cocktail hour if you wished. Internet access is free in the Napua Tower, also, and there is a designated concierge to help with dinner or site seeing reservations. The location is wonderful. You can get to many wonderful things on the Island in less than 45 minutes. The beach is one of the best on Maui. It has wonderful shopping, golf, and restuarants nearby. Negatives: The hotel is huge. It took me a good day or so to get my bearings. If you are on a higher floor or in the Napua tower, you will have to take two separate elevators to get to the pool or spa. The pools can get a little crowded with people putting their towels out early. Cabanas cost a lot of money, but you do get waited on! The breeze is always nice, so I do not think the cabanas are needed. Umbrellas for the beach are free (at least for Napua Tower guests.) Food and drinks are very expensive. A bloody mary or other mixed drink is $13 and lunch can easily run $22 dollars for a sandwich of some sort. We only ate in the hotel for a couple of lunches. The food was good (the onion rings were to die for.) You can certainly find both more expensive and less expensive food outside the resort! We had many wonderful meals in Maui. You can buy your own drinks (soda pop, water, liquor, beer) and keep it in your room.

Get ready to pay for every little thing. You get charged a daily fee ($10) + parking ($20) + porterage ($10) + housekeeping ($3), etc . I wasn't aware that the bill was masterbilled under a group rate, so these were all included. Not knowing, I graciously tipped those who served us. Not that they didn't deserve a tip...just not double. Make sure to ask if these services are included in your package when you check in, because it won't be apparent. Hot tip: if you plan to eat breakfast on the grounds, instead of room service, you can take a short walk up to the cafeteria style store and buy off the grill items for about 1/3 of the price of room service. Ate there just about every day and wasn't disappointed. You can pop out just down the road in Kihei town and hit Stella Blues/Jawz/Thailand Cuisine/Pita Paradise and get a pretty inexpensive meal. Golf courses surround the property and it is pretty easy to book the day of. It's pretty slow right now because of the economy, so look online and in the travel magazines for deals. You can drive about 30 minutes and pay $100 less and play several decent courses in Kahili and Dunes @ Maui Lani or even less at muni-like courses Elleair or Pukalani.

Housekeeping staff was wonderful and efficient. The restaurant, Humu... was nothing special. The entrees were OK. You are surrounded by bodies of water that closely resemble swamps, not really appetizing.

The ambience at the Four Seasons is better for adults and the breakfast there is better, so just walk next door. Price wise though, you get a bigger bang for your buck at the Grand Wailea and they share the same beach.

It really is a beautiful hotel on a beautiful stretch of beach. Room We had a few problems with our room during our stay - the toilet broke, the safe broke, and the TV broke...seems like alot of problems for a room during a 7 day stay. I will say, however, that they very promptly responded to the concerns and fixed the toilet and safe very promptly...although the safe malfunctioned again at the end of our stay, we didn't bother to raise the issue again. The TV never was fixed properly - every 15 min, we had to jiggle the coaxial wire when the TV signal was lost; this after 2 service calls. however, we didn't spend much time watching TV so it wasn't a big deal. In my opinion for a hotel of this class (and price), I think it is ridiculous to have 3 issues with a room during a single week. The bed was great - very comfortable, and the lanai was equally great. Bathroom was definitely 5-star. Beach Note, this resort is situated on a public beach. Not a swimming beach, at least at the time of the year we were there, but wonderful soft sand, and fun to jump into the waves...good for kids and adults. We rented a \"casabella\" for 4 of the days we were there and what a WASTE of money. True, you do get a guaranteed spot, and a nice view of the ocean, but of significant issue was the fact that about 2:30pm, we had non-paying \"visitors\" squatting in the adjacent casabellas. I raised this with the staff, and they explained that because they start removing the loungers and umbrellas at 3pm, this is a \"grey\" area and they don't really enforce the use of the casabellas for that reason from about 3pm onward. Well, there didn't seem to be any \"grey area\" with my $50/day bill for use of the casabellas! I think the resort should be pro-rating the charge for the \"free\" hours they are allowing non-paying patrons to use them. It really is absurd - so my advice, do not book a casabella...instead, wait until about 2:30pm and choose any free one and enjoy! Clearly the hotel has no problem with this. Food The food was excellent. Humu has an amazing filet mignon that is cooked to perfection. All the food was really quite good. Breakfast was quite good too - we ate at the buffet in the Grand Dining Room for breakfast. Like many similar places, you have to be prepared to wait a while to get a made-to-order omlette. The waiters at breakfast could also stand to get a refresher in good customer service...at least some of them. A couple of the waiters we had were great, others were terrible...no service at all. And, I personally saw one of the waiters go to the bathroom (beside the restaurant) and he didn't wash his hands. How disgusting is that? We had room service one evening and it was very good (albeit outrageously priced). Service Service was largely good...not great, but good. The wait staff at dinner was far better than breakfast or lunch. Despite the fact we paid $50/day for the casabellas, we only had a server approach us on 2 of the 4 days we rented the casabella. I thought the maid service was very good, and was impressed when I went to the room (on two occasions) while the maid was in the room, and she insisted I demonstrate it was my room by using the key card...this vs. my experience in Mexico where I strolled into the room when the maid was there and got a polite smile, despite I could have been anyone taking anything from the room. One other note is the cost of food / drinks during the day is really quite absurd. $13 for a cocktail (plus tip?). A hot dog will cost you $12 (each). I ordered some sushi and beers on the beach and rang up a $70 bill for a snack...gimme a break. Overall, a beautiful resort, on a beautiful beach. However, the $50/day casabella charge when others used it for free really iritated me. I wrote the hotel with the same complaint, and didn't hear back...I guess they don't care. So, my advice to all is feel free to use the casabellas, for free, from 2:30pm onward. And, if anyone asks, this is hotel practice and the \"grey area\". Would I go back?

My son just wanted to go from the top pool down though all the little water slides (the two large slides were too scary for him) and float around the lazy river. When we arrived, a family who was leaving gave us their giant green and pink float rings (we passed them on when we left as well). The families staying there were very laid back, nice friendly people who were happy to chat or snooze, whatever. We didn't run into any high-maintenance folks complaining. The wait staff were present but not intrusive. They weren't spraying you with Evian or bringing frozen fruit on a stick but they were helpful when needed and extremely friendly. I felt that the kids were safe when out of direct eyesight, as there are people tending all the waterslides (presumably as a safety measure as well as keeping people who aren't staying at the GW from clogging the pools). The place is huge and we didn't even try to explore the other wing of the hotel. We never went to the adult pool, though it looked fairly empty. We got a great deal on the room, so for the price and the enjoyment of the entire family it couldn't be beat. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian village on Ohau and the Hyatt in Lahaina.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The resort was clean and well the landscaping was in perfect shape. It is obivous that they put alot of work in to keeping the resort in good condition. It's located right on the beach, which is a nice beach. The pools are the best on the island with an adult only and large waterpark like pool for everybody. Drinks at the pool start at about $13, which tends to make you not buy many. I think they should lower the drink price and make up the profit with volume on the drinks. They have private Cabanas at the pools, but require a resvation and cost a couple of hundred dollars for the day. The food is good but overpriced, as are most of the nice resturants on the island. We ate the daily the breakfast buffet because it was part of our package it was good but not worth the 30 plus dollars per person if your paying for it separetely.

Beautiful shampoos, body lotions etc were supplied which are also available to purchase from the spa shop. Rooms were serviced quite promptly and we also had turn down service at night. Outside we had a table, two chairs, footstool and small rack for wet swimsuits. The wonderful waterslides at the pool were just great for our boys (and us too!).

I read the reviews from months ago and it seemed they were struggling with keeping guests happy. Then in recent months the reviews seemed to have been more positive. The one common theme I read among them was poor food service, great SPA and love the pools. After spending 7 nights there I would agree with each of those. The only one I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d add is that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the personality of a 5 star property. More like a 3.5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4.0. I say this only because of the lack of personal service and attention to detail shown to the guests. I guess this is probably due to the fact it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 700+ room facility and spread out like an amusement park. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful property with amazing views, groomed grounds and a pool area that would compete with the fun of a small water park. It also has the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pool which was nice for those of us traveling to getaway and relax. ROOMS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We booked an ocean view room. It was nice, but had a better view of the garden than the ocean. After requesting to be changed we were put into a corner room and it was great. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there are many at the ocean view rate, but if there are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c request the corner room. It has a much larger bathroom and walk-in closet. Not to mention a window in the bathroom that overlooks the ocean (also two ocean view windows in the bedroom area). The rooms were clean and neat. Very nicely decorated with newer amenities. The only complaint on the room was the A/C. It seemed to struggle to keep it cool, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t uncomfortable. STAFF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Front desk was always helpful and friendly. BILLING \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We requested a refrigerator for the room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a onetime charge of $25. They put it on the bill twice. They did the same thing to one of the others in our party. However, another one in our party wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charged at all. So, definitely review your bill for accuracy. Several have posted similar encounters about this. SPA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Outstanding! Awesome facility, services and staff. The only unpleasant part was the front desk receptionist. Her name was LJ and she was very bad at her job. As the first and last person the guests see at the Spa, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think they would have someone friendly and helpful there. But, look past that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once inside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best spa you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever find. FITNESS CENTER - Very nice and well equipped. GROUNDS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the landscaping and pools were impeccable. The pools and slides were more fun for adults than kids I think. We spent many hours being kids again! The only drawback is the size of this place. You spend a lot of time walking to get from your room to anywhere (pool, front desk, shops, etc). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget something in your room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long haul back there. FOOD \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Head to Safeway and stock your fridge! The restaurants are overpriced and not that good. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd menu poolside was the biggest disappointment. The burgers were dry and tasteless. Very unfortunate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to make a good burger. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind paying the high prices for the convenience, but not when the quality is worse than fast food.

Our bill included hundreds of dollars of charges that we never made including a large bar bill that we never incurred (huge charge for numerous Heineken beers which neither I nor my wife drink) We had to speak with several people at the front desk before anyone would agree to adjust the bill. The first person we spoke to at the front desk plainly told us that she had no authority to do anything about it and that we were out of luck. Next, the internet was not available in the rooms for two days of the trip (I do hear that they have since upgraded to wireless). It seems that internet access is standard for a hotel of this caliber. The advertisement for the room we booked said that it had a mini-refrigerator. When we got to the room and it did not have a refrigerator, they agreed to set one up (after two different requests). They then tried to charge us about 25 dollars to have the refrigerator - not a big deal but felt like they were nickel and diming us. The people at the front desk could not be less knowlegable or less caring. After promising us a late check-out (2 pm), they locked us out of our room at noon. They failed to record my Hilton Honors number even though I gave them my card and I had to call Hilton directly to get retroactive credit for the stay. There is a resort charge of about 25 bucks a day that seems to provide no benefit. Other resorts provide free snorkle gear or free internet access when there is a resort charge - this resort charge seemed to provide us nothing. Of course, we did have an excellent time.

Our very first impression as we drove in to the resort was that this was going to be a perfect honeymoon. The drive in to the resort is beautiful, especially at night with all of the Tiki torches lit. We were promptly greeted by the valet and escorted to the check-in desk and we were offered a free upgrade, as promised, but we were a bit disappointed that we were only offered a room with 2 double beds instead of a king - especially since the resort appeared to be extremely vacant. The room was as we expected, but it was not perfectly clean. The balconies looked as though they had not been washed in several months and the shower had mold along the grout lines where the grout met the glass. The landscaping of the resort was impeccable, but unfortunately that was not shared by the rest of the amenities. The common area hallways were not very clean and the upkeep was not spectacular. You don't need to look far to see areas that need improvement. Lot's of painting, cleaning, and repairs need to be made to get this hotel to what should be Waldorf-Astoria standards. One day I removed my plastic bracelet (Daily plastic bracelets must be worn to access the pool and beach areas) and placed it on a table near the elevator. Two days later when we checked out it was still there! This should give you some idea of the lack of attention to detail. I would guess that no less than 100 employees walked by that bracelet during those 2 days. The food at the Grand Wailea was spectacular, and overall the service was good. Our highlights include the service at the swim-up pool bar as provided by Wayne and Richard. Our waiter, Justin, at HumuHumu was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Some of the disappointments were the service at the breakfast restaurant, the Grand Dining Room. They must expect most customers to eat the Buffet so that they can serve theirselves, because the service was almost non-existent. We ate here three times and had hrrible service all three times. On our third visit, we decided to time how long it took before we were greeted by our server. It took 12 minutes, followed by another 9 minutes just to get coffee! We did complain to the hotel manager who put us in touch with the Food & Beverage Manager and the charges for two of the meals were reversed. Service by the adult pool was also very poor. We did see servers, but nobody ever stopped by to take our drink orders despite our attempts to wave their attention. We had to go inside the poolside restaurant to get our own drinks. The activities at the GW and in Maui are great. I am a certified diver, but my wife is not. She took a 45 minute course at the resort which consisted of a 20 minute lecture followed by a dive in their own dive pool. We were then both take to a beach dive right at the resort that had some reef and sea life. Our instructor/guide, Eric, was excellent. He was very friendly and we found sea turtles and a small octopus that we actually held in our hands while he took underwater photography. The concierge was also excellent. You MUST take advantage of the concierge. They will build you a whole itinerary for your visit and have relationships to book all of the non-resort activities on your behalf and have them billed to your room. We took a helicoptor tour of West Maui and Molokini with Sunshine helicoptors. They are the only provider that will guarantee front row seating for two for a small premium upgrade. The tour was good - not great, though that was no fault of the tour guide. It's just unfortunate that there are no active volcanoes to see in Maui. We also took a snorkel/snuba tour on a powered twin-hull catamaran out of Maalea Harbour. We dove at two locations Molokini Crater and another \"unknown\" location that was know to have lots of turtles. The crater was decent, but if you have any experience scuba diving, then this will not live up to your expectations. We happened to be out on a very windy and wavey day, so the snorkeling was difficult for most of the inexperienced snorkel, snuba divers (Snuba is a hybrid of snorkeling and scuba that allows you to breathe up to 20 feet underwater via a hose and air tank that floats on the surface). The highlight of this tour was having about 20 spinner dolphins swim with the boat as we cruised at slow speed between dives. The burgers that they cook right on board between dives were also pretty tasty! We did a zipline tour in Kaanapali that wes pretty good. Not as scarey as the ziplining in Costa Rica, but that's a good thing for most people. It seems much safer and has very large landing platforms so there is no fear of making any mistakes. In fact, they make it foolproof and the scenery is of course spectacular. The highlight of our activities was the drive to Hana. The drive is simply breathtaking through lush, tropical landscape along the most winding road you will ever travel! I recommend going on a day that has forecasted some rain or had rain the night before. The dozens of waterfalls that we saw along the way were extremely active due to all the rainfall they had up the mountain. Don't worry - it doesn't ever seem to rain in Wailea despite the forecast. Wailea gets 16\" of rain a year while it rains over 350\" just 10 miles away! It's the strangest thing - but very cool! The concierge will provide you a list of the best places to stop along the way to swim in waterholes and waterfalls, eat banana bread, buy local art, have a scenic lunch, etc. Do not miss out on this excursion! It takes a full day, but I found it far more exhilerating than the helicoptor tour. We drove back the same way we came up, though you can go all the way around the mountain. My wife had a videcamera but was afraid to let go of the dashboard because of my speeding down the roads! For driving enthusiasts that like to go fast, this is as good as it gets. By fast I mean a top speed of maybe 30 MPH. This road has over 600 turns where you turn the wheel greater than 45 degrees. I hope Playstation has this road on one of their driving games because I'm buying it! Other recommendations for food include Mama's Fish House for dinner. It's about a 30 minute drive from the resort, but it's very charming and the food is delicious. Everyone that you talk to will tell you to go here. We also had great meals at Duo and Spago next door at the Four Seasons. Overall, we had a wonderful trip. We had some disappointments with the resort that we did not expect to have when spending that kind of money. Plan to spend a lot of money! We averaged about $750 a day for 2 people, not including the cost of the room. The activities will run about $300 for ziplining to over $800 for the helicoptor tour. When you add that to $200+ dinners and lunch and drinks by the pool, you will see how it quickly adds up.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "Lizsamail", "ReviewID": "UR49897539", "Content": "Awesome!

This hotel is truly one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed. It is a massive place and there is lots of walking to get around, but who cares!!! Once you figure out where your room is, it's easy enough to find your way around. Firstly the rooms - they are enormous. I have a 9th floor room in the Molokai wing with views to the ocean, over the gardens and the pools. The sunsets from my balcony were breathtaking. The room itself was enormous - easily the biggest room I have ever had in any hotel. The bathroom was big enough to throw a party in with both a shower and the deepest tub. Everything you could need was supplied and the little touches like the prettily folded towels with ginger flowers made it extra-special. It was also lovely to come back to the room every night to find a card on your pillow with a lovely saying and yet another flower - I felt very pampered. The restaurants - very very expensive, but very very good. We ate at Humuhumu one night and whilst it was outrageously priced, the food was superb as was the service. I ate my breakfast at Kafe Kulu which serves up lighter fare - rather than the big buffet breakfast in the main restaurant. Again it was expensive considering the food was fairly ordinary - but it was good enough for me - breakfast burritos, french toast, yoghurt and cereal. And sitting out on the deck and watching the sparrows made for a very pleasant start to the day. I also had lunch twice at Bistro Molokini which was fabulous - great food, very well prepared and just delicious. The pools and gardens - well everyone raves about these and with good reason. I was there in November so finding a pool chair was never a problem, but I can imagine in the middle of summer holidays it could be a problem. I also didn't find a multitude of kids thank goodness - but again in high season, well it certainly wouldn't be quiet or relaxing. The outrageous charges for the cabanas meant that I rarely saw anyone using them - what a shame. But there are so many different pools to sit by and the adult-only area is fantastic - what a brilliant idea. I didn't do the slides etc, but plenty of people were and seemed to be having a ball. Even the beach was great - and this coming from an Aussie!!! I also enjoyed the lovely beach walk heading in either direction along the foreshore - definately give that a go early morning or late afternoon. From the business point of view I couldn't have had a better experience - I organise lots of conferences and business meetings and dealing with the staff (including Delia and the lovely Sharon) was simply easy - which is exactly what I want. The meeting room we had was lovely - everything worked like clockwork - the timing of food, arranging a data projector when ours broke down - it was just smooth. Okay so that is all the positives - my only real negative I guess would be Wailea itself. It is very very expensive - the Shops at Wailea are lovely, but mostly designer and if you have the dollars to spend in Gucci or Tiffany, then great. But Kihei is just down the road - about $12 in a cab, and that is much more reasonable. I also found eating out in Wailea super expensive with little choice - Ruth Chris's Steakhouse at the shops was great, but the prices were mad. We also ate at Seawatch - it was again expensive, but worth every cent as the food was sublime and the service exceptional. My big tip - like many othes on the site - is hire a car, you will need it to get around and out of Wailea so you don't have to re-mortgage your house to pay for your holiday. I was lucky as being a business trip all costs were pretty much covered. If I could afford it I would definately take the family there, but I would hire a car for sure. My other tips - make the effort to get up early and go up Haleakala to watch the sunrise one morning, and the Sunset Cocktail Cruise aboard the Alii Nui was amazing value for money and just so much fun.

When I saw that The Grand Wailea on Maui was considered a Hilton Honors hotel, we knew we could expect the quality of our stay to measure up to the high expectations we had for our trip. And we were not at all disappointed. We knew we were making a financial sacrifice for even our short two-day stay at The Grand Wailea, but our stay was like a dream! (I rated the resort 'average' for 'Value' simply because the room rate is a bit expensive -- even for Maui -- though it offers a great stay if affordable.) Upon check-in, we were thrilled to find that our upgrade gave us an absolutely beautiful view of the ocean! And that was the great beginning to our wonderful stay. Our visit to Maui was one that we have talked about incessantly, and will remember joyfully. The resort's common space and grounds are absolutely beautiful, and our room was so neat, clean, and tastefully decorated. The front-desk staff at the Grand Wailea went out of their way to provide us advice about convenient and more affordable dining options within the hotel as well as the locals' place, Da Kitchen, in nearby Kihei. They also advised us of inexpensive tour options like the beautiful Iao Valley, and shared the value of us doing even an abbreviated drive up the Road to Hana! The service we received from the Grand Wailea's bellmen, front desk, housekeeping, and dining wait staff was so cordial and valuable. We also enjoyed pleasant conversation with our bartender in one of Grand Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants, while we took in the gorgeous sunset! And my daughter and I had great fun with the water slides and pools! When it came time for us to leave the resort, our bellman was a genius in the way he methodically situated all of our luggage in the trunk of our car -- on the first try! The Grand Wailea indeed offers the full package!

They claim $50 Mil in renovations, but our room seemed dated and there was black stuff (mold maybe??) in the shower. For 2 nights, the cleaning people failed to remove the dirty glasses from our room and we had to set them outside to have them replaced. On first night, I went down to the pool, and could not a towel. So I asked one of the hotel staff and they instructed me to get on the phone and request a towel. Well a few minutes later another staff person comes by the pool and she has folded up fresh towels on her golf cart; naturally I assumed one was for me, because I was the only person at the pool. When I asked her about the towel she told me I had to call the desk and request one!! I told her that I had already did that,and her reply was that I had to wait. She then proceeded to grab the clean towels up and carry them back into some storage area. I was just about to create a stink when another gentleman comes walking by with a clean towel..... Overall this place was average... Positives: 1. Wonderful Sunsets 2. Nice beach right outside of the hotel 3. Free internet (Negative with this also) 4. Free Bike Rental (at least for us anyway) 5. Plenty of on site activities (you have to pay though) 6. Awesome Pools!!! Negatives: 1. Customer Service could be improved with some of the grounds staff (Desk staff and the people out in the front were excellent). 2. No courtesy shuttle from airport to hotel; you have to either: a. Rent a Car b. Speedy Shuttle ($28 per person; need to give the guy a tip also) 3. Free internet has a limited connection speed. If you want faster, you have to pay. Tips: 1. Bus stop less than 1/4 mile away from the hotel. Costs $1 and will take you to kehai for plenty of shopping; sushi; etc 2. They do offer free bike rentals, but you better be in shape cause there are hills galore. 3. Rent a Car if you plan on going on any off site excursions! 4.

The buildings, facilities, restaurants are beyond excellent and of the highest quality we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever experienced (I melted in that bed) The kids club is extensive, the opportunity for adults to use a separate pool without us families seems like a great thing too.

We thought the resort was absolutely amazing and vowed to return for our 5 yr anniversary. We loved it so much we couldn't wait the 5 yrs and returned September 2009 for our 3rd anniversary. It was a bit of a let down. We stayed in the Napua Tower which we were upgraded to 3 yrs ago and loved it. The morning breakfast is very plentiful but the evening cocktails are a little sparse. Our room overlooked the chapel and rooftop area where nightly wedding receptions were held. I enjoyed watching and listening to their entertainment but it can get a bit loud. I believe there is a noise ordinance that doesn't allow music past 10pm which is nice. The beds are like sleeping on a cloud. We opted to rent a refrigerator for $25 for the entire stay which was nice, but it is more of a freezer. Turned down to level 1 our drinks still froze as well as any food we kept in there. The rooms are large with a huge bathroom. I enjoyed several bubble baths in the soaking tub. We stayed for two weeks and the first week we felt as if we were the only ones at the resort the occupancy was extremely low yet we still did not get very personalized service. In fact, despite being out of our room from 8am it was still not cleaned at 2pm when we returned. Not a huge deal but a little inconvienent. We were there celebrating our anniversary which was told to the front desk at check in yet NO ONE ever said Happy Anniversary. No complimentary bottle of champagne. No fruit basket. Not even a coupon for a spa treatment or dinner. I was expecting more. The pools were great, the beach was awesome. Take advantage of the complimentary lounge chairs and umbrellas at the beach. the food at the pool area is very good (especially the tuna) but is pretty pricey. Molokini restaurant was closed due to low occupancy while we were there. The parking lot is a bit of a walk and the spaces are tight but we had no problem finding a space even when there was a convention the 2nd week of our stay. Kihei is a short drive from Wailea with lots of great cheap shops and restaurants. Be sure to check out Hilo Hatties and ABC for souveniers. Vietnamese cuisine (in Azele shopping center) & Maui Taco for cheap large tasty meals. All in all, Grand Wailea is great if you have never been here before it is well worth the experience, but if you want more personalized service i say go elsewhere. Note: while there, there was an article in Maui News that resort is planning a million dollar expansion project that will relocate the chapel and add more suites. If this goes through, i would strongly reconsider staying here. it can get very crowded already. I know I will not be returning if the expansion goes through, I'm already weary about returning and considering the Marriott or 4 Seasons for more personalized service.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Vacation in Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "PowaySanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR45695874", "Content": "Last week my husband and I stayed at the Grand Wailea in the Napua Tower for the second time this year.

As a silver member of Hilton HHonors, I was given a $40 certificate for use in the restaurants. Very, very nice. The rooms are very nice. Seem up to date with anything you need.

We were at the hotel over Labor Day weekend (checked out on Tuesday after Labor Day). What a great time for those of us without kids to visit HawaiI! The first few days, the adult pool was key to our enjoyment. Every once in awhile someone under 18 would venture over and within 15 minutes a very kind security officer escorted them to the other, more appropriate pool. (Thank you!) Very close to Kihei for great breakfast spots and grocery stores. We bought snacks and brought them and sodas to the pool versus paying the very, very high drink prices (over $10 for a drink at the pool?!?). The spa is amazing. The loofa scrub and baths before and after my massage was amazing. I did it two years ago and forgot how good it was. The prices for the spa were a bit high - but with the scrub and baths, totally worth it. Fitness center is great too. Classes for $10 is a great deal. Very clean gym. Staff was very friendly in the fitness center. Staff at the hotel were great. Everyone friendly. Everyone says hello in the hallways and smiles at you. Something so basic, but means alot! I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. I was worried about it after reading other reviews and am very glad we had such a great experience.

We've stayed in older places that were cleaner. Dirty stuff around the toilet area and there were always these nasty gnats that hung around the toilet. Everyday I killed 3-5 of them.

The hotel has every amenity and some wonderful restaurants. We were particularly fond of Bistro Molokini and enjoyed having Cafe Kula at our disposal for easy meals. As for honeymoon amenities there wasn't much, but we did come home to a romantic evening of orchids all around our room and in our jacuzzi tub. I had one major complaint. There were ants in our room, they were really small, and I believe they were the result of our complimentary chocolate covered strawberries being left out, which the bellman was quick to report and before we new it they had collected the ant ridden dish and brought a brand new one with a cover, still the little ants were kicking around for the entire trip, though they were mainly delegated to the desk. They did have an exterminator coming on our last day. My only other complaint was that the hotel offers hospitality suites that we took advantage of since we were leaving at 9:30pm, but unfortunately we found the suite dirty, the shower wet and all the towels were used. It was gross thinking you would use a shower that you didn't know who was in it before you and it hadn't been cleaned. Luckily we didn't go to the pool that day, but if we had we would have been stuck using the shower. But at least they had a place we could get dressed, so its a minor complaint. Despite the ants and the hospitality suite... I would go back in a heartbeat when I have a family of my own, if I can afford to. if I was to rebook my honeymoon though, I might consider someplace a little less family oriented and a little more romantic. But my fiance loved it and I thought it was a great location, I can't complain and we had a lot of fun. I hear the spa is wonderful but we didn't have the time or money to try it out.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle Washington", "Title": "\u201cWhere did all the kid's come from...\u201d", "Author": "Globaltraveler5", "ReviewID": "UR39349079", "Content": "Grand Wailea is the most beautiful hotel and we had been wanting to relax on our vacation...but the hotel is a huge water park with lot's of children running around - the rooms and grounds are deluxe and spendy - we would choose another property next time that is quite around the pool areas with not so many families.

I was nothing more than blown away with the amazing grounds, the great service, and the awesome beach. It takes a lot to actually \"blow me away\", but this was definitley achieved at this resort. When, we got there, they asked if we were on our honeymoon- sweet, but we weren't. We were there for our 5 year anniversary, so they automatically upgraded us to a bigger room on the concierge level, which included a free cocktail hour with a free breakfast every morning. AWESOME! Nothing is cheap in Hawaii, so FREE was unbelievable! The pools, although kid friendly, were awesome for my husband and me. They have an adults only pool which gets you away from the noise, but seriously, who doesn't want to be a kid still and go down those water slides??? Awesome! The beach in front of the Grand Wailea should not be taken for granted. There are many hotels in Maui that don't have that great of a beach front. This resort is the exception. Not only is there great snorkeling on down toward the Marriott, but the size of the beach directly in front of the beach was great for playing and laying out. Service? I don't know how you could complain. I guess if you are a princess and want someone to sit next to you every second of the day and be there at the drop of a hat, then you might have a case. Otherwise, fo us normal people, service was very efficient and very friendly. The Humuhumu restaurant on the resort was also very good. We went to the Four Seasons, The Fairmont, Mama's Fish House, and some other local places and this was our second favorite (behind Mama's...you gotta go there on your way home from Hana!) The room we stayed in was big, had a great view, and was exceptionally clean. I highly recommend renting a refrigerador for the week for only $20. Probably the cheapest thing we did! Unless other rooms in this resort are way different, I don't see how anyone could complain. All in all, this was the best trip of both me and my husband.

I traveled with my husband and two children (1 and 5 years) for a long anticipated summer vacation. I chose the Grand b/c of the beach, pools and adult activities alike. This was my second trip. The first was about 8 years ago for a conference. I fell in love with the hotel back then. This time around I can honestly say that I still love the hotel, grounds, pools , beach and spa -but the food and room / furniture left much to be desired. After a 50 million dollar renovation, I could not explain why there was chipped furniture and peeling paint in our deluxe garden view lagoon wing room. Several handles fell off of our bedside table. New Carpet??? Hard to tell. There was also a slight musty smell in the room that I got used to after the first day. There did not appear to be an air conditioner vent in the bathroom and it felt quite warm in there most days. The room air conditioner was adequate though. The marbled bathroom very nice and spacious. The food: Overpriced for the quality. Skip lunch at the volcano bar and try the brick oven baked pizza at Bistro Molokini instead. Cafe Kula had a decent lunch menu with great onion rings and a plate lunch though the teriyaki chicken was overcooked. Because we were traveling with small children, I was too tired to go next door to the shops for lunch or dinner. The hubby and I hired a sitter and had dinner at Humu Humu it was ok. I had the lobster bisque and the surf and turf. The steak was right on but my lobster tasted grainy. The service was professional and attentive but inexperienced. We loved dinner however, at Cuatro in Kihei. A must try! We did not have breakfast so I cannot review this area. With the kids, we chose to feed them in the room. We were lucky enough to have a refrigerator and a microwave so this made it easy for us to heat up bottles and serve my son cereal. I even had reheated left overs one morning. The pool: What we expected and why we chose the hotel. My 5 year old loved the beach and the pool. We rented a casabella (2 shaded,padded lounge chairs and 2 regular sun-exposed loungers) for 150.00 per day for the entire week. This was truly the best investment we made during the entire trip. I can't imagine having to trek down to the pool at 7 am to reserve chairs as most of our fellow pool users did. The pool service was great. Shortly after checking into our casabella for the day we were given a fruit tray with banana bread and iced water which was replaced throughout the day. We were also given popsicles and frozen grapes throughout the day as well. My husband especially love the chilled towels!!! The pool side amenities were a nice touch but they came at a steep price. It is truly a shame to have to pay for shade. The pool is really laking in enough shady places to sit (bummer). The cost for the casabella was a little easier to swallow after my husband and I decided to pay for an elite membership $1500.00 (non-refundable) with 30% off best available rates for the rooms and 20% off food, beverages and spa/salon for future stays. In doing so, we were given a $500.00 resort credit which helped to off set our casabella rental costs. The pools and slides were a blast especially for a pool loving family. I felt like a kid again! For any future trips I will definitely reserve a casabella by the pool ($150) or facing the beach but near the pool ($75.00). In summary, we loved the pools and grounds. The staff were wonderful and very accommodating. I never once had to wait for our room to be cleaned. The housekeeping staff took very good care of us. I do not blame the hotel for charging the $25.00 resort fee because between bathing, the spa and the pool I must have used 15-20 towels per day! Not to mention the white sheets and duvet covers that were changed daily. By the way, the Terme baths are not to be missed. You can show up at 4 pm (last call) a reservation for the baths is not required and for $55.00, what is there not to like! Skip the massage. The baths were not at all crowded. I went to the spa on a rainy afternoon and left the husband and the kids napping in the room...total bliss for 2 hours! Although the Grand Wailea is not a 5 star hotel, it is pretty darn nice for an upscale resort. What I like best about the Grand is that there is something for everyone. The adult pool, gym and spa for mom and dad and the best resort pool anywhere that not only kids but parents can enjoy as well. We hope to return next year. PS - After the first day of valet parking we took advantage of the free self parking lot. The parking spaces were small and it was not ideal to have to walk to the parking lot through the loading and receiving dock. At times we could smell the stench of warm garbage...Yuk!! During our last trip, self parking was located in the current valet lot. We miss the old location and it was too bad our polynesian fantasy was disrupted every time we walked to the car.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "calif", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Staff Ever\u201d", "Author": "dkc9", "ReviewID": "UR38499960", "Content": "Please forward to your General Manager.

Napua Tower Ken (Concierge) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sarah would not know what to do, if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for Ken who has taken care of all her concerns for our family. He is simply GREAT and one of reasons why we enjoyed our first visit so much and decided to return. Key Asset! Zenith (Bartender) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where did you find her? I watched in amazement as she remembered guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s names after guests and their drinks as well! She remembered us just as we arrived! She is AWESOME! Key Asset! Cabana Services Nelson \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sarah just loves his smile and tremendous disposition. He is great with the kids and extremely helpful for EVERYTHING! Key Asset! Pool KaryAnn (Activities) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am not sure when this girl sleeps?! She was one of the first to greet us as soon as she saw us at the pool.

Larry (now at HumuHumu) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what a great smile, and attitude. He is great with people and has one of those natural ways about him that you cannot help feel good when you see him. Gym I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her name, but extremely kind and friendly. Tall, with long brown hair and big brown eyes. Hands a towel to each guest when they arrive and helps to anyone that is lost or looks confused with the equipment. Bellmen We missed their names, but one of the men has been there since we started coming 7 years ago. He looks like a model and has a tremendous attitude to help anyone coming and going. He works outside and takes the bags just as we pull up. He took our Christmas pictures by the waterfall this year. The other bellman actually took care of our bags when we checked out. Tall, bald, and goatee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like stone cold Steve Austin. (Ha! But much nicer!) Great relief and help since we wanted to get dinner before catching our evening flight and he took care of everything, bags stored, retrieved, taxi, loaded and go! Housekeeping I know that we never got to know them in person or by name, but they were terrific in taking care of the messes we left behind each day. And can I say extremely honest?! One morning in my haste, I left my money clip on the night table. I did not realize it until I returned to the room that afternoon and found it placed discreetly on the night stand under the notepad.

I would like to state first off that my expectations were low after having read some of these reviews. The Hotel - It is a truly beautiful setting and we were so pleased when we drove in past an amazing waterfall and lovely lobby. We were a little bit annoyed about the $20 per day resort charge, as it was mandatory and you couldn't opt out of what it was for so we didn't understand why it wasn't included in the room price. However, it is on the website so I suppose that is fair. I should state that the valet parking is $20 per day but they do offer free self parking. The room - Lovely, perfect. We were upgraded to a garden view room and it was spacious enough for my family of 2 adults and 2 grown children. Great big bathroom, perfectly air conditioned and lovely deck. We were only slightly taken aback by the $8.50 charge for water in the room! The pools - Fantastic. The children in our family were over 18 so we got to use the Hibiscus pool which is far quieter than the activity pool but in close proximity and so we could still use the slides etc. The slides are amazing for a hotel pool, and it was not too crowded when we were there. The poolside snacks are ok but very expensive for what they are ($8 for shaved ice). The restaurants - This is where the hotel really lets itself down we felt. They were expensive, and the food was ok but the service is dreadful and clumsy for the price. It feels a little like you are dining at a theme park. However, there are some great restaurants in the shopping center next door, so don't let this discourage you. The spa - Expensive and one member of staff was rude Was another example of the service not going over and above what they are required to do. The facial had was fine. Had manicure and pedicure with my daughter - cost almost $200! The concierge - useless. My husband and son wanted a beach that would have some waves, they had no idea. Overall I would say that go if you can afford it, we had a great time just using the pools and our room. However, be aware that the service is not amazing, so go elsewhere to eat.

I apologize to any parent that has well-behaved children and frequent this hotel; however, little girls running and screaming through the hallways, having a play car hitting me in the foot during cocktail hour, little boys sliding across the floor to get their toys from under tables, and a little girl scooting her chair all the way across the hall during lunch and stopping in front of us, is all unacceptable behavior at a nice hotel. Worst thing is, the parents barely notice or if they do, they just look up and smile (as if to say, isn't my child cute?). In fact I am sitting in the room right now and on the eighth floor I can hear children running down the hallway and yelling to their parents to let them in the room and another child is yelling out on the balcony.

We tried to check-in at noon, but no rooms were available until 4:30. (Amazing, since the hotels are not full!) Right away the difference in level of service and friendliness was apparent between the two places. Once we were able to move into our room, it was very warm as most hotel rooms can be at the beginning. We turned the A/C down, waited 3 hours and called maintenance to fix (when it was apparent that it wasn't working properly) while we were at dinner. When we arrived back at the hotel, it was still warm and we had to call again. Also, the cable had been out for the entire day (which we didn't need until the evening) Maintenance indicated that they have a conservation mode that makes the A/C not work when there is no movement in the room, which he overrode. Also, there is no A/C in the bathrooms, so it was extremely warm for our entire stay. We finally had to have housekeeping bring fans to our room as management indicated that they had no rooms to move us to. (Some level of service!) Our room never did get cool enough for us even though we had NO issues at the Wailea Beach Villas. Management never checked back with us to see if everything had been resolved. Lack of caring is a theme I had read about this hotel before I booked, but I guess we thought we'd be the exception. Rooms - They may say they are updated, but we travel extensively, and we were not impressed. Decor may be updated, but the beds were so soft and worn that we highly doubt they were upgraded. While the room was our biggest disappointment, we are happy we didn't have to spend tons of time in the room, but for the price, we expected more. Pools - These were the reason we chose the Grand Wailea and they didn't disappoint. My kids, age 12 and 13, enjoyed them, but as we thought, two days of the craziness of the Disney scene was enough for them as well. Lines for the largest slide were long, so I can't imagine what they would be like if the hotel was completely packed. Spa - I enjoyed a wonderful massage that included an hour of various bath treatments and scrub that made my experience the most enjoyable of the time at this hotel. Kuddo's to those who work in the spa. Only downside, once again, was the lack of enough A/C when trying to get ready to head to the airport after my appointment.

Although I stay at different hotels in Maui at different times, I've been coming for perhaps nine years now, as I am a member of the Grand Wailea Club, which offers a 50% discount from the \"rack rates.\" It used to be more a deal, but with discounted hotel offers these days it's not as big as an incentive, especially as I've got $2500 \"on loan\" to the hotel for the benefit (which I get back when I want to end this \"priviige\"). What the Grand Wailea offers that no other hotel on Maui has (as far as I know) is the fantastic pool and water slides, with a magnificent and wide swatch of prime oceanfront with a white sandy beach. Whether you are five years old or you are sixty years old (and still a kid at heart), it's absolutely a blast to ride the slides, float, or swim. And if you like kids (and you should if you stay at the Grand Wailea), it's great to see kids having so much fun. Most kids never seem off to take off their daily pool band that is issued daily, with ever changing colors. It's not uncommon to see some kids with perhaps up to a dozen colored wristbands which they wear until they get back home! And if you are an adult, there is always the adults only swimming pool, for a more peaceful trip to the pool. The kids pool and water slide area can be extremely crowded, so you have to be prepared for that. We like the lunch grill here, and the Cheeseburgers and sandwiches are excellent. As for food in the rest of the hotel, we love the Huma Huma restaurant, and the breakfast buffet is outstanding. Service at the hotel is fine, not exceptional, but if you really want great service in a perfect hotel environment, then check in next door at the Four Seasons, as they have mastered service in a way that the Grand Wailea has not and they truly make you feel like an honored guest. Staying at the Grand Wailea is a bit more akin to being a guest at Disneyland as you really are at a hotel that doubles as a theme park. As for prices, the Grand Wailea charges premium prices for most everything....there are no great bargains to be found here ($4.50 for a glass of fruit punch at the poolside burger shack!) but....they have certainly mastered the art of building a hotel with a fantastic pool/water park area.

The Grand Wailea has this wonderful convenience factor. The beach is amazing! The pools are incredible and many to choose from.

Nothing is more amazing than listening to island music on my IPOD, and watching the incredible views from my lounge chair. The staff was incredible.

The Good: The facility is beautiful and the beach is beautiful. Everything is well kept and very nice. Room service did a great job every day. We didn't have kids with us so we spent a decent amount of time at the adult pool area. It's a nice pool with a big lawn you can hang out. We really enjoyed the peace and quiet. The beach is open to the public but not too many people outside the resort go there. You can swim in the water and the current is not bad at all. The staff seemed nice and we had good service from just about everyone. Valet parking for the day is free but you pay a lot to stay overnight. The Bad: As with everything in Hawaii the food and beverages at the hotel are very expensive. We bought a styrofoam cooler and some beer and wine at the Wal Mart and kept this in our room. We still ate and drank at the hotel but having our little cooler was a nice break from $10+ drinks. Overnight valet parking is very expensive so we parked in the free lot on the other side of the resort. It's first come first serve and fills up at night so get there early if you want a spot. There are some rooms that are newly renovated and others that are not. We were originally put in a newly renovated room but it had two beds. When they moved us to a room with one bed it was the older room. Bummer. It was nice but not as nice as the other. We didn't pay for our room (paid for by corporate) but when I compared the cost of this hotel vs. other comparable hotels it seemed a little pricey for what you get. I think this is because of the sweet beach location. We would consider returning in spite of this. Especially if we bring kids. The best part of our trip was renting a Harley for the day and cruising the island. Definitely one of the most memorable times of my life. Sorry if my review wasn't very thorough but we spent a lot of time either playing offsite or at organized social functions revolved around business.

From the moment you walk in, the hotel itself will blow you away with how breathtaking it is. We visited the Four Seasons, and the white hotel next door to the Four Seasons ( cant think of the name ) , and trust me, although the Four Seasons is nothing to sneeze at, its not nearly as dramatic, and open and large as the Grand W. Remember the movie phrase, \" You had me at hello\"? That's kind of how you feel when you walk through the large lobby of the GW. Regarding our room , we had an ocean view room on the 8th floor, which was ready for us, with a warm bath, with flowers floating on top.. A nice honeymoon touch that we didn't expect - On a one to ten rating regarding the room being perfectly clean, I would give it an 8. A large hand print over the headboard that you could see in certain day light knocked down the rating. The bed was comfy, had a flat screen TV, and the bathroom was large with a tub and shower. The balcony was pretty big too which had a large table , two chairs and enough room where you can stow your suitcases. The pool situation at the GW is crazy -insane- nice. ( And probably 3 times larger than the FS hotel. They have an adult pool and a kiddie area with water slides. The overall grounds at the GW are very well maintained. Spend the time yourself and look online at the pictures so you make an informed decision. You'll see what I mean. The gym at the GW is two levels overall and rates pretty highly among hotels. I generally stay at 4 star hotels and this is one of the best I have come across. They have very top notch new equipment with a decent amount of free weights too. Don't be surprised to run into a few celebrities. We did. They offer yoga classes on the beach, boot camp, spin you name it. The SPA itself is huge and my wife and I did a couples massage. Personally I'm not that big of a spa person but it's as nice as I've seen, and of course the price tag comes along with that. They have like 5 different types of bath tubs to soak in Japanese style, hot tubs, 2 steam rooms, and like most places every treatment you can possibly imagine. Heads up look for a pretty decent discount coupon on your inboard flight magazine. Unfortunately we found it on the way home. A few things that I thought could be better. The restaurants closed mostly at 9pm. The main bar closed at 11ish. Overall if this place had any downside, the dining experiences we enjoyed the most were located off property. The best the GW has to offer is the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a. I wouldn't say any of their restaurants are terrible but for the money certainly not stellar. The place to be dining wise, is outside under that stars at Ferrars( Four Seasons), Tommy Bahamas, two minutes away at the shops at GW and of course an old favorite Ruth Chris. All not cheap but all very very good. We didn't get to try Spago's but heard great things there too. For the area that the GW is situated, being young and wanting to party a bit, the downfall is pretty much the entire town closes early. Certainly the bars at the GW do. Mulligan's a bar around 3 miles away located at a golf course ( go figure ) is open the latest and seems to have a local theme. We also suggest hitting the local Kmart or Walmart, twenty minute drive and loading up on a cheap cooler and beer and some snacks. This will save some money because the drinks are $$$$$. Other misc. info. Room service food is consistent with what I said about the restaurants. Make sure to put the do not disturb sign on your door. They are very consistent on knocking on your door to clean your room. Wi-Fi is not available in your hotel room but it's free in the lobby and the Napua towers lobby. This could certainly be improved. It is 2009? The beach is large and nice, and chairs and umbrella's are free. Also they don't allow you to swim in the hot tub or pool very late. Security guards get notified by cameras if you try. We did several times. So like anything else in Maui, this place is very expensive, very romantic, and my opinion VERY worth it if you can afford it. OOPS I almost forget. The staff that we came across were great.

Upon our arrival, my immediate impression was that it looked really outdated, peach/pink accents that reminded me of the late 80's/early 90's. We waited in line to check in and the staff at the front desk were quite rude. The hotel was only about 50% occupied. It was 4:00pm by the time we checked in however our room wasn't ready, so we were put in another room supposedly with a better view. The hotel is quite large and there are several elevators that take you only to the pool/spa area and others that take you only to your room. We were not given any direction as to where are room was located and how to get there.

The room was small, dark and the bathroom didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single place to put your toiletries not even a drawer or a cabinet. We were starving and asked where the restaurant was located, we were told to go down to the second floor, but not told that there restaurants were not open yet, this information would have been very helpful. Once we figured that out after walking forever to find that it was closed, we asked a staff member where we could get some food. We were directed to one of the pool bars. we found it, sat down, ordered and then were told that it was closing in 10 minutes!!! it was 4:50pm! By this time I was getting a little annoyed and asked to speak with a manager. She was nice and upgraded us to a nicer room located in the napui tower (this is where you want to stay). This was part of the remodeled section others are referring to. The room was bigger, brighter and nicer. the bathroom was bigger as well. The complimentary breakfast buffet was quite nice. They also serve complimentary drinks at 5pm, which was nice, but the drinks are very mediocre, albeit free. If they would not have upgraded us to the napui tower, I would have been out of there!!! We stayed 4 nights. the level of service at the hotel is laughable although not funny when you are paying $500 bucks per night. We ate at the restaurant humuhumu (shortened) 2 times. The first time was part of a wedding reception we attended, the food was quite good. The second time we at there we were initially told that we (my husband and I) couldn't get a table, I insisted that we get one. They called back and said they could squeeze us in. Once we got there, there was hardly anyone there!! not even 50% full. ridiculous. Everything was a hassle at this hotel! We had dinner at the Four Seasons down the road at Spago. It was quite a contrast in terms of service, we were treated as guests although we only at dinner there. If I had to do it again, I would stay at the Four Seasons. It was packed with a lot of energy unlike the Grand Wailea, which was like a ghost town. One of the bartenders at the Grand Wailea said that because occupancy has been low, they have been closing down the pool bar early and opening the restaurants later. The only employee of the hotel who was polite was the Manager we spoke with. On the upside, the pools alone were amazing especially the kids pool - there is nothing like it that I have seen before. WE have 2 young kids (under 5) and they would have loved the pool - but were not traveling with us for this trip. They also had a nice pool for adults only which was nice. The service at the pool....TERRIBLE!!!! Good luck finding a drink or something to eat! Even after renting out cabanas the service was STILL bad. the chapel is quite lovely and a great place to take pictures. the humu humu restaurant is really nice and tranquil if you can get a reservation.....Our friends very small wedding was quite beautiful. The outside grounds of the hotel are really quite beautiful. It's very sad to see a hotel that has an amazing potential and such a great history, go downhill so quickly.

Everything was well maintained, housekeeping were fantastic. The view was spectacular, directly in front of us, we could see Molokini. We even saw a few whales from our balcony in the mornings. The food was probably just average for resort food. My hubby and I know Maui pretty well, so we often ventured off the hotel for better food. The spa was grand as well- with the many different types of soaking tubs, jacuzzis, and showers... I was disappointed that they only allowed you to use those amenities an hour prior to your service. And, the spa was slightly disorganized. There was no one to give me a tour of the facilities-- and I was unaware that there was a scrub included in the service- in which you had to tip the attendant separately. Although it was just my husband and I, the most memorable part of the hotel for the both of us were the amazing pools, slides, and water features... I think kids and those that are just kids at heart would love their pools & slides. I love that the Wailea beach is so easily accessible from the hotel-- and it was really easy to grab a chair to just sit and read peacefully at the beach. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGrand Wailea - Best place in Maui to Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "RSC518", "ReviewID": "UR31867653", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Grand Wailea for our week-long vacation in Maui.

Heck the worst lounge chair at the GW is still a thousand times better than the chair in my office, LOL. At the beach they will set-up seats where ever you want so no rush at all for beach days, just go to the kiosk. Pricing for food on the resort was exactly as posted on their website, so there were no surprises there at all.

Our two girls (ages 6 and 8) loved the pool complex, with its seven water-slides and the water elevator. That was the main draw. The issues we had were that, first, the pool area is very over-crowded. To get a place by the pool, you MUST be at the pool by at least 7:30am, or even earlier. If you want a chair in the shade by the pool, you MUST be in line by 7am or earlier. Sound relaxing? Not once you witness two or three fights over pool chairs. This happens because security comes and takes away towels from the pool chairs if they are not used within the hour. The poor unsuspecting person then taking the chair is accosted by the returning guest, who thinks the person sitting in the chair has stolen it from them. This happened repeatedly on our visit. Very unpleasant. Another issue is the size of the resort. We were in a nice room relatively close to the pool in comparison to the other rooms. But that's still a 10 minute walk, requiring the use of two different elevators.

We are a family of 4 with Mom, Dad, a 3 year old daughter, and a 2 year old son. The resort proved to be perfect for our family needs and in my opinion, to the needs of any traveler regardless of travelling companions and purpose. We chose the Grand Wailea due to its location, its many up-scale amenities and their pool system, (which is fun for kids of all ages). We wanted to spoil ourselves a little after our last trip, (see my Trip Advisor review for Breezes Curacao) and this resort seemed to fill the niche. The Grand Wailea is a resort in the 4 star plus category and lives up to its billing. The entry and grounds are impressive and well kept. Check in is smooth and quick (after a fresh flower lei greeting and a cool-refreshing glass of fresh pineapple juice), which is a blessing after a long flight (meaning the check in and the cold pineapple juice both). It also has beautiful interior architecture and impressive attention to detail in the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Luxurious marble abounds. The only problem I could see with the resort property itself is that the exterior looked a little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during daylight hours only. Not architecturally, just color wise. It looked as though it was a faded or light pink version of that pink you see in the art deco areas of Miami. Perhaps a different color swatch (the white you see in the buildings of Mykonos would look great Grand Wailea) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaning a fresh coat of paint\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could cure that and look great with the interior theme/d\u00c3\u00a9cor but otherwise, an all around first rate resort and definitely not a deal breaker. We stayed in the Napua tower section and had an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view king room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ocean view was very impressive with Molokini crater and the island of Kahoolawe in the background. The room was clean, and the Berber carpets, linens and toiletries were first rate. The bathroom is large with a huge whirlpool tub, separate shower, separate toilet and impressive marble/tile work. Ample hot water was never a problem (regardless of what time of day), and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a personal pet peeve with me at most resorts. They are also not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153towel stingy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which gives it another \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in my book. The staff is super friendly and helpful. In fact, we had a situation in the middle of the night regarding our 2 year old and bedding, (use your imagination). They swept in immediately to resolve the problem with a smile on their face. A real trooper and a veteran he was. It was late, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch his name, but what a help. The only problem we had with the staff and this was only an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intermittent problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is that sometimes they could be a little slow to respond even for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153island time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With that said, we were there at the peak of slow season and at the peak of slow season, I suspect they have fewer staff on hand. I know if I was a proactive manager, I would be working a skeleton crew during slow season in this economy in the spirit of efficiency and maximizing resources to make my P&L as tight as possible. Job security, you know. Anyway, there is a trade off. In slow season you get an un-crowded resort, fast/easy lines on the water features, and less crowded beach and restaurants. You still get the same friendly and personal service from the staff, it just may take a few minutes longer than normal if they are wrapping up tending to someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs. It is a very minimal complaint, and I would return this time of year because I would prefer the service we got, with the resort being less crowded versus consistently faster service and more crowds. I could envision problems getting a good spot at the pool or beach, (unless you got up really early) during peak season, so this trade off was fine and acceptable. The resort itself is large and impressive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got beautiful gardens with walking paths and koi ponds along the way. The water features are impressive and resembles a small water park. For the non kid crowd, they have a large adult pool with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own bar to service your needs. While the resort is large, it is well planned out as it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to get to any one spot on the property that you wish to get to, (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the angles and logistical placement of paths, stairs and elevators). Additionally, things are spaced out just enough and floor planned well enough, that whether you are looking for romantic get away, having a wedding, on a honeymoon, an older traveler looking for some R&R, or a family with 10 screaming kids; nobody is on top of each other. The older R&R traveler will not be affected by the family with 10 screaming kids. Conversely, the parents of the 10 screaming kids won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel guilty about encroaching on someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good time. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how they did it, but they did, and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even hear through the walls. Nice. They have excellent shops on site with premium brand names and plenty of restaurants and food to satisfy the pallet. We did find the resort food to be very pricey which was expected, but we only spent 1 full day on the resort and a few half days here and there due to getting out for activities. With that said, the resort has enough amenities with the waterslides, water elevator, hot tubs, rope swings, spa and restaurants that you can have a great time without leaving. We however like to experience where we travel as much as possible, so we always plan off resort activities. You can find much cheaper food off the resort with just a quick drive north on the coast heading towards Kihei. A small local place called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Da Kitchen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a great find. It was recommended through a sitter we hired while we went SCUBA diving from Happy Kids Maui baby sitting service. We also hit the Safeway and picked up a gallon of milk, some cereal for the kids, some snacks and plastic-ware to get us through mornings and snack times, (which worked out great and allowed us to save a few bucks). We just used the mini bar for our stuff, and left the stuff already inside alone. Of course you can also drive a little further into Lahaina in West Maui for some more affordable dining. In all, this is a first class place. Everything was up to or exceeded our expectations. I would definitely recommend this resort to any of my friends or family (regardless of the size/ages of family members or romantic status) as this resort works for anyone for any vacation purpose. While we got an excellent deal on off season rates, we would still stay there full price and to me, that says a lot about this place. Maui is a regular haunt for us and this so far is the best resort experience we have had on this incredible island.

Now any other hotel I have stayed at has actually given us a bottle of wine or champagne in the room.

I did however enjoy the fact that they offer hospitality rooms after you check out. We had an 8:45pm flight so even though we had to check out we could still enjoy the resort, beach and pools. Then go to the front desk, ask for a hospitality room and they give you a room for 45 mins so you can shower and clean up before you have to take off. Great idea! Wish more hotels did this.

My daughter and I really wanted to go back to that property. We are quite smitten with the HWV fantasy pools, boat ride to our room, dolphins, and Buddha Point. But, my wife insisted that we make it to Maui for this trip. The Maui Ritz in Kapalua had a great rate but we quickly soured on that idea after reading all the negative reviews. A couple of years ago I saw a great piece on the Travel Channel about the Grand Wailea, Oprah takes her staff there, and based on the abundance of positive reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to give this hotel a chance. This vacation, far and away, was the best we have ever experienced. The weather: We arrived after the spring break crush on April 22, 2009. One day ahead of plan because the weather forecast for our stay looked quite bleak and the 22nd was the only day not calling for rain (even though my wife assured me that Wailea had a freakish micro-micro climate with little or no clouds/rain.) Upon our descent into Maui, as I had feared, a huge low pressure system laid a thick layer of clouds over the islands. As we made our final approach from the south, a small break in the clouds allowed the sun to light up a few hotels on the southern shore of Maui. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make out the GW, but, with its white wash exterior I could clearly see the Fairmont from the window of the plane. I knew the Fairmont was in the same neighborhood as the GW. So maybe we had a chance of avoiding the dreaded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrained out\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hawaii vacation. The hotel made arrangement for our transportation from the airport (taxi). As mentioned, we decided to come a day early and the concierge said they would change our pick up date. The change wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made. No big deal, we grabbed a taxi (mini van) at the stand, and made our way to the resort. ($60 + tip). The cab driver was great and the ride was short (20-25 minutes). As we rolled into Wailea, the scenery turned noticeably up-scale. Arrival and check-in were flawless. The lei greeting made it special. As reported by others, the bell desk is excellent, and really got the stay off to a good start as they escorted us up to our room in the Napua tower. Although more expensive, the Napua tower was an excellent value (A few more sq ft., better lanai furniture, central location, morning continental breakfast, and evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres/cocktails, and personal concierge). I recommend a room facing west to catch the sunset (Or, get a Napua suite.) As mentioned by others, the fantasy pools are great. They do a good job of separating the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig fun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 water park from the sublime adult pool. As planned, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t venture out of Wailea. We fell into a nice resort rhythm during our 6 day stay. 1.Breakfast at the Napua Club 2.Have the GW staff set up our beach umbrella and chairs. 3.Wander back and forth between the beach and pools. 4.Participate in one \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloosely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 planned event for the day (spa, luau, snorkeling, scuba lessons) 5.Lunch at our beach camp. (My wife would venture to shopping center next door and grab us some deli sandwiches and snacks.) 6.Grab a cocktail in the Humu lounge for the torch lighting ceremony 7.Head up to the Napua Club for evening hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres and a few more cocktails. 8.Watch the sunset from the lanai. 9.Nightly stroll of torch lit property and beach. 10.End up back in the lobby bar for some live music and night cap (the bartender made the kids great smoothies) 11.Head back up to the room, watch the local Hawaii news and go to sleep. (Return to step 1 and repeat for six days/five nights) The kids will be older for our next visit to Hawaii, therefore will add a little more off site adventure, but, we all really enjoyed falling into this daily relaxed routine. The few negative reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read about this property are from folks who expect the staff to perform at a Four Season, Ritz, or Park Hyatt level. Many of the GW staff does perform at that level especially the bell desk, and the Napua Club bartenders/servers. I felt like the GW is reaching for the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcflawless\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 service standards you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect at a 5 star property, and they come oh, so very close. Only a couple slips. My wife asked the pool server for a cocktail while looking for a place to lounge and the server abruptly asked her to find her seat first (the server apologized). The young woman running the towel/wrist band desk in the morning could probably use some training at the Disney institute. One night housekeeping arrived to restock our ice bucket with a plastic laundry bag of ice.(handing me the bag). I mentioned this to the manager on duty and he said they would put a stop to this 'tacky' practice). As mentioned before, they fumbled our pick up at the airport (I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine the Four Seasons would have dropped that ball). I did visit our next door neighbors (Marriot and Four Seasons). The evening vibe at the Four Seasons is fantastic, but the facility is ho-hum compared to the Grand Wailea and the exterior of the Marriot is downright dowdy/low-rent in appearance (although in fairness, the new Marriot adult pools are sharp and, based on the pictures, the rooms look rather nice). At the end of the day the extraordinary facility and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmostly perfect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 service, push the Grand Wailea to the top in my book. Even w/out the kids in tow we would be hard pressed to pick the Four Seasons over the GW (but, for sure, we will stop by for dinner at Spago). p.s. Not one drop of rain fell in our little Wailea micro climate during the six day stay. Even though the road to Hana was closed (mud slides) and the leeward side of the island experience heavy rains and flash floods (not common for the leeward side).", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for families who enjoy the water!\u201d", "Author": "girlguide61", "ReviewID": "UR29389944", "Content": "The greatest part about our trip and the hotel were the surprises, exploring, and just relaxing while still having fun! I can tell you that the hotel is great for families who enjoy the water. The pools are fantastic and the beach out front is perfect! On most days we would settle on the beach near the pool. When the waves were big enough to bodysurf we swam at the beach but for most of the day we found ourselves in an oasis of slides and pools. I found myself giggling a number of times -even after my 40th time down the slides. Near the beach there is a hut where someone gives you towels and will bring lounge chairs and umbrellas to the beach and set you all up. No extra fee, but we tipped $5 to $10 ( four lounge chairs and 2 umbrellas). This way you can place your chairs and umbrellas in any direction you want vs. pool are set one way. No, the food is not great and yes, it is expensive. ( I found food prices on Maui expensive overall - but the wine is cheaper) I was impressed with the artwork and the gardens!!! Beautiful. The room was large enough for our family of four and the large bathroom helped. Overall the hotel was fantastic for our family! After we stayed here 6 days we went to Ekahi Village which was also beautiful - it was nice to eat in for a change again. My advice is if you are watching your pennies stay at the Wailea for a few days and enjoy all that the hotel has to offer then stay at a condo.

This is not a hand holding resort, you have to figure it out yourself. This isn't really a con but for those that like a cruise director, there isn't one here!

This time we added a couple of days to our trip at the last minute and decided to give it a try after hearing about the renovation. First off the renovation is great. I would not have recognized the rooms from our previous stay. New carpet, furniture, a great comfortable bed, really nice. No more mold or mildew smell. The rooms are now right there in the 4 Star category. The service was also much better. We were upgraded to a ocean view deluxe room that did have a nice view of the property and ocean. They were at low occupancy so we had no issues with housekeeping or getting service by the pool or beach. The pools are great. We have 4 kids - 8,7,4,2 and there was a pool for each of them. The little ones love the small pools connected by small slides and then down to a nice flowing river. The older kids loved the large slides and rope swing park. The largest slide is really fun even for adults. The pool area was not crowded with minimal lines and we always were able to get good spots in the shade. The grounds of the hotel are huge with rivers, small lakes with fish, and bridges. Our kids really liked walking around the property. All of the above made this a great stay. As other reviews have said be prepared to be nickel and dimmed here. I was expecting it but was surprised still. A cabana at the pool was $225 per day ($70 at nearby places), drinks in the $15 range, breakfast buffet for us was over $100 (Adequate but nothing special). In general for the rates they charge you would expect a higher quality of food and service. This didn't affect our trip but should be noted. The biggest surprise came on our last night. We came back to our room to find a note under our door saying that all the upper pools, river, slides, etc. would be closed Tuesday to Friday. Not a word about this when we checked in or at any time during our stay until this note. We were checking out the next morning so it didn't affect us but it would have really messed up our trip if we would have been just arriving. I understand that these complicated systems need maintenance but no notice. I know the Hawaii hotels are hurting but is seems short sighted to not warn people checking in or making reservations about this. I would guess having 4 days of down revenue is better than losing customers. Anyway, we had a great time at this resort as the pool closure didn't affect us and I would definitely come back but I would really ask to confirm the pool will be open when you are there.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brush Prairie, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat for people used to crowds and lines.\u201d", "Author": "hipmamatravels", "ReviewID": "UR28772753", "Content": "We are frequent Maui visitors and usually rent a private home for our vacation. My kids always long for a pool so on this trip instead of forking over $400 to go to a luau or snorkeling trip we spent one night at the Grand Wailea in order to use their amazing pool. The cheapest rate we could find online was $468 for a midweek, garden view room. We were allowed to check in at noon and get right down to the pool. Only trouble is you have to have chairs staked out at 7AM if you want a place to sit. We wandered around the PACKED pool area and finally \"squatted\" on some chairs in front of an unrented cabana. Cabana's rent for $300 a day! So many were not being used and have both chairs under cover and right in front. The ones in front are covered with towels but we went ahead and set our stuff there. I wouldn't have felt comfortable sitting there for fear of getting kicked off. The kids had a blast in the pool. It was a little cold for me and the 2 hot tubs were packed with people. 2 kids meals, 2 adult meals and 2 cocktails cost $92 poolside. Ouch. The room was lovely. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view. The bathroom was all marble and enormous. It was clean. The bed was comfy and soft. We sent the kids back to the house with the sitter and spent the night alone as a couple. Ahhhh this part was heavenly. We woke up at 6:30 AM the next morning to stake out some shaded lounge chairs. The night before we'd scouted out 3 choices. At exactly 6:58 I arrived poolside to find our first 2 choices already taken. I scrambled to the 3rd, tossed things from my bag onto them and then stood in a line 10 deep (at 7 freaking AM) to get towels. Amazing. And this was after the spring break weeks on a Wednesday morning. They do have a policy that they will remove personal things from chairs not used for an hour but I never saw them do this. There are very few chairs with umbrellas over them which is hard when you have small children. Overall we're glad we did it once but we would never go back. The only draw of this resort over neighboring ones is the pool and my kids were bored with it by the 2nd day. The stress of having to wait in line, jostling for chairs etc. took away from any fun we had. There are so many cheaper places to stay with free chairs, ocean view etc. for half the price.

Check-in was hassle free and they were friendly and very accomodating in having us placed in the same wing (we were on the chapel side). The amount of Aloha at this hotel is overwhelming, service was superb. I can't believe how people can write mediocre reviews for this hotel. The rooms were clean, spacious and well lit. Bathrooms were spacious, equipped with a glass shower stall and separate tub. The towels were huge, soft and fluffy. Linens on the beds were crisp and clean. The room's air conditioning system was a great asset during the humid weekend. The big flat screen TV was a nice addition. The only thing our room was missing was a refrigerator and microwave.

ROOM: We stayed in a Napua Club Room and if you are willing to pay the extra cost , it is definitely worth it! The room service was exceptional, and the turn down service even better. The Napua Level included a full breakfast buffet every morning, water/ice tea and cookies all day, and an AMAZING cocktail hour starting at 5:30. The Mai Tai's were incredible, and the bar tender (I wish I could remember her name) was very nice and called all of us by our first and last names. The room was awesome, and the beds even more. The view equally as great, and the bathroom too. Shower was huge, and the jacuzzi tub was as well. The whole room had a very luxurious classy vibe to it. FOOD: Expensive.... but very very good. I'm not going to complain about the prices at this hotel, because at the end of the day you get what you pay for. This hotel is known for being luxurious and high class, so obviously it will be highly priced. Although, once again the food was impeccable. We ate at every restaurant and our personal favorite was the \"Bistro Molokini\". It was the cafe next to the adult pool, and although casual the food was still wonderful, with a variety of options. POOLS: PERFECT. The adult pool was always quiet, and had friendly pool service. You can reserve a cabana near the pool for a fee, but it was a nice bonus. The hot tubs were set at a perfect temperature as well. The main pool had SO many awesome activities and kept the kids busy all day. Between the water slides, lazy river, and rope swing i'd say it was one of the best pools i've ever seen. You can also schedule scuba diving lessons, they have a private pool to learn in. BEACH: Very nice, the water was very calm and nice to swim in. If I had one complaint i'd say that it was a bit to crowded. It isn't a very big beach, and when you have 3 hotels that are using that beach it can get crowded quickly. Make sure you get up and grab a nice spot early in the morning. (Same goes for the pools) LOCATION: Excellent. The Wailea shops were a short walk away, and if you feel like eating away from the resort there are some casual restaurants within walking distance as well.

I am a hotel snob and was very happy with the Grand Wailea. This was our first visit to this property. I had stayed at the Ritz in Kapalua previously at the other end of the island - I like the Wailea area much better. We booked the least expensive category room and received a nice (complimentary) upgrade to a pool view/partial ocean view room in the Lagoon wing. We found the room and bath to be spacious and luxurious. The feather beds were quite welcoming after 14 hours of traveling - nice linens as well. We enjoyed the separate shower, soaker tub, island fragrance bath amenities and large bath sheet towels in the bathroom. Maid service was excellent & efficient while we were at breakfast each morning - and dinner for trundown time in the evening. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast the first morning but settled on the quick service Cafe Kula for the following breakfasts. We miss the locally made bagels - try the coconut or pineapple toasted with guava jam - Yummy! The food is ridiculously expensive but it is simply this way at all top rated hotels in Hawaii. The pool and beach were the real draw for our spring break trip. We loved every aspect of the pools - all the slides, rope swing, water elevator, swift moving canyon, lazy river and swim up bar. We enjoyed delicious burgers poolside several days. The hotel offers poolside activities for a fee that my daughter enjoyed such as Puka Shell necklace making and lei making. They also offer a spa cabana that offers manicures, pedicures & hair wraps/braids pool/beach side. I enjoyed walking on the path that runs between all the Wailea hotels along the beach daily - great whale watching from this path. There are a few hotels along the walking path that offer beverages, coffee, breakfast treats for sale. We really enjoyed lunching over at the Four Season's a few days - treat yourself to the beautiful view and a delicious lobster sandwich at their poolside grill. You may even see a celebrity or two - we did! Some recommendations: Whale Watching tour with \"Pacific Whale Foundation\" - visit their website for more info. They run a great, informative tour and have a wonderful gift shop at their Ma'alaea harbor location. \"Maui Ocean Center\" at Ma'alaea Harbor - Hawaii's aquarium is super for all ages and they have another great gift shop. \"Hula Cookies\" in this same shopping center at Ma'alaea - to die for cookies with Island ingredients, local Roselani ice creams and shave ice. Try an ice cream sandwich made with chocolate chip mac nut cookies and kona coffee or coconut ice cream in the middle. YUMMY! 2 restaurants not to miss are: Stella Blue's in the Azeka Plaza in N. Kihei (10-12 minutes from hotel). The locals eat here and they have 3 meals a day here - delicious and fairly priced. \"Mama's Fish House\" in Paia (30-40 minutes from hotel) - simply don't miss this splurge - incredible fresh fish, fantastic tropical libations and a beachside location. This will be a memorable dinner for all - they do have a children's menu. Make reservations online at opentable.com - highly recommend the 5pm to 5:30pm time frame so you can enjoy the ocean view before it gets dark. \"Shops of Wailea\" adjacent to the hotel (walk or drive). Luxury shopping & dining along with more budget friendly shopping & dining. Enjoy souvenir shopping at Whalers General Store or ABC Store and ice cream at Lappert's. They also have complimentary hula dancing & music some nights. Self park in the Makena deck by using your room key card. Enjoy your trip to Hawaii.

We thoroughly enjoyed the morning breakfast and the evening cocktails- it is such a great set-up and makes it so nice each morning and evening. The rooms have been re-done new paint, carpet, etc. and are really nicely appointed-- I have to say that the Napua Nani suite is as nice (actually nicer I think!) than any luxury condo. The living room and adjoining room make it very comfortable and roomy. The DVD in the living room was great for a movie for the little ones. The entertainment value of this resort just can't be beat--the kids (2 and 6) had a blast at the pools and on the slides, and there was always someting to do. From feeding the fish at Humuhumu on Friday mornings and a big Thanks to Laurie at Camp Grande down by the pool who made \"craftmaking\" very memorable-- from memory boxes to tie dyed t-shirts it was great!! I would definitely recommend the Grand Wailea to anyone who wants a fun filled vacation at a beautiful location-It's worth it! The service and food and the restaurants were very good, and the Wailea shops next door are also nice and make it convenient, and just up the street Matteo's pizzeria was a good casual meal.

The place is basically the \"Grandest\" hotel in probably the grandest resort (Wailea) on probably the best Hawian island. We went at the begining of Sept and it was only a thrid full which was great as busy but just nice, you could always get loungers, always got served quickly etc whereas we spoke to some people who had been there during the main weeks and they said it was bedlam and too busy so avoid then if possble. Hotel itself is huge with some grand rooms - the lobby and main bar area is impressive, with certain areas open to the elements and just oozes class. Rooms very spacious and very comfortable with flat screen tv's, mini bars and all other mod cons - bathroom was loved by my wife as has huge bath and at least a double sized walk in shower, 2 sinks etc etc etc. One of the main reasons we loved it so much was the pool areas; several pools starting at the top of the hill that have different slides (fast, twisty, straight leading into lazy river through ravine) that you just work your way through until you eventually come t the pool bar where \"you have to have a mudslide cocktail\" and then flow through the lazy river that takes you metres from the beachfront and then if you see fit back up to the top on a water elevator. For adults and bigger kids only who want fast slides, there are 2 big slides that go from top to bottom quickly that are great fun. Food at the hotel and neigbouring hotels (Fairmont & Four Seasons) plus \"The shops at Wailea\" is out of this world, good sized portions and sea food to die for (I think i ate the Pacifics stock of Scallops and Shrimp). The only downside is that this holiday aint a cheap one. The Grand Wailea dont seem to discount and only offer room only and the local restaurants as mentioned above costs best part of $200 per meal (2 adults and one child, starter, main and couple drinks) but i guess you get what you pay for. 10 mins drive away are cheaper restaurants and good supermarkets that you should definately use to stock up your water, drinks, snacks etc as they are probably only 25% of the price you pay at the hotel. Would i go there again - most definately and to be honest would kind of live with the cost if it was not for the 10 hour flight to the West Coast of America followed by a further 6 hours to Maui.

First, let me say, it is really, really expensive. We got what is supposed to be an Ocean Front room, which means, you have an unobstructed view of the ocean but it is not \"ocean front.\" It's just at a higher floor. The rooms are spacious and the linens, products, soaps etc... in the room are all high quality. The air conditioning is great and is tied to the Lanai sliding glass door (A/C turns off when door is open). The grounds, both inside and out, are simply beautiful. I've stayed in many upscale hotels. The Grand Wailea is is one of the few where I've been this deeply impressed. Lovely sculpture, manicured gardens, waterfalls, ponds, a beautiful wedding chapel, magnificent spa, impressive lobby and bars, a fun kids pool and an 18+ pool for those wanting to avoid kids - it's all there at the Grand Wailea. And it's all for a price. We had an Ocean front room for one night (w/ AAA discount), Valet Parking, a \"casabella\" (two padded chairs w/ a cover), Two Adult Room Service Breakfasts with Coffee and Juice, Two kids Hot Dogs, Two cheeseburgers and two mixed drinks. Our check out bill was close to $1100. We ate dinner off-site. There are less expensive rooms and we were allowed to have a one-time exemption to have 5 people in the room (we had to request in advance and acknowledge risk factors etc...). We were also able to enjoy the facilites prior to official check-in time (4:30 PM) so a one night stay allows you to enjoy what the Grand Wailea offers. We enjoyed our stay at the Grand Wailea and the kids loved the pool. It's worth experiencing at least once in a lifetime. If you have the money or want to experience the grounds, this is a great hotel. If you have a special event, like a wedding, and you're trading guest count for beauty and memories, this is a great place to have it.

We found the Grand Wailea to be fantastic. First, upon arrival they waived the $25 resort fee. Second, beach umbrellas are now free. Yes, everything is expensive, but they seem to have gotten the message about nickel and diming their guests to death. Food quality at the Bistro for lunch was mediocre. The breakfast buffet was nothing special as for selection or quality; not worth the cost. We had dinner at Kincha, the Japanese restaurant. It was fantastic. Unfortunately, it is closing the end of this month. A one time $25 fee for use of a room refrigerator is the smartest $25 you'll spend. You can then have breakfast in your room, have a place to store left overs, make sandwiches for lunch, for example. Some of the best snorkeling we found on Maui was just a brief walk down the beach. In fact while we were there we saw many of the tour boats stopping off the same point we could go to without paying someone to get us there. If you need to watch your dining budget, be prepared to run up to Kihei Town for bargain meals. Otherwise be prepared to pay and pay. If you've got the money to stay at a place of this caliber you should find this place pretty nice. If you can afford more, you'll likely enjoy the Four Season's (right next door) more.

I don't think there was anything about the property or the stay to dissuade me from going there again. We arrived around 2:30p (check in is 3p) and were told our room was not ready yet. No biggie, headed to the bar for an adult beverage (after picking our jaws off of the ground over how the grounds looked, even in the rain that had been hitting the islands for about 3 days). The front desk called my cell phone to tell me the room was ready, and to our great surprise (and many thanks to our travel agent Amy), we found we had been upgraded to the more exclusive Napua Tower. Our room, 8045, was superb. A nice sized balcony with a view of the hills to the right, and the ocean to the left, and looking over the grounds. The bed was very, very comfortable, and the bath had a separate soaking tub and glass-enclosed shower, dual vanity, and separate toilet area. We had rain the first 2 days of our stay in Wailea, but of course those days are taylor-made for shopping, and there is a nice shopping area right next door (The Shops of Wailea - I think most of the managers knew us by first names it seemed ;-) The rain also limited our exploring the grounds as much as we would have likes, and that was limited to a bit over the last 2 days. But we really liked what we saw. The pools were wonderful, and the \"family\" pool didn't seem that crowded when we went wandering around. Even the beach wasn't that busy. I'm betting a lot was due to the time of year and the economy though. The times we ate at the resort, especially at Humuhumunukunukuapua'a for dinner, were some of the better meals we've had. You do get a complimentary continental breakfast when staying in the Napua Towers, which is pretty good, but we did do the regular breakfast buffet which was a fairly good deal and tasty too. No matter who it was, every member of the staff always had a smile, and greeted us with an \"Aloha\", even when we asked at the last minute for a little later checkout. From the bartenders to the bellman to the housekeepers to the valets, I don't remember not getting at least a smile. And yes, there are a couple of minor complaints. First off, it seems most of the bars (especially around some of the pools) close early or aren't open very long. The swim-up Grotto Bar was only open from 12p - 5p, most of the other bars closed by 7 or 8p (exception being the Botero Bar, in the main atrium). Couldn't really determine if it was a year-round policy regarding the hours or because of the economy limiting the number of guests, but it seems this is not a place for late-night partying (which was actually OK with us, since we were in the relaxing mode). And a more minor gripe, I thought the pu-pus left a little to be desired. They were good, but not up to the caliber of the the rest of the meals. And as far as the 'nickel and diming' some people complain about, it's not like these are surprise fees. They are right up front, and if you don't like them, don't stay there. I knew what I was getting when I booked, and especially with the upgrade, I had no complaints.

We have stayed at numerous Hiltons and Conrads, but this is the first (and most likely last) time we will be staying in a Waldorf Astoria property. I would not have paid half of the rates posted to stay at this resort. Some of my personal disappointments: 1. The front desk first offered me an \"ocean view\" room. However, when we entered the room, the view, if any, was COMPLETELY blocked by the foliage of a big tree. After we went back to the front desk to complain, they then changed us to an \"above the tree line\" room with views of the ocean. Mind you, the property is NOT FULL and I do not understand why they'd want to put customers in less desirable rooms in the first place when there are plenty of others vacant? 2. The hotel charges for EVERYTHING. From $250/day for a large canopy (which is 95% vacant everyday, since no one in today's economy would want to shell out that kind of money for shade), to $50/day for a smaller two-persons lounger, to $25 to clean out the in-room fridge for us to put our own drinks in there, to $25/day resort fee (which by the way, should cover those shaded canopies in the first place). 3. Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond members be aware, none of your normal loyalty perks is applicable here. We did not receive any breakfast, newspaper or spa passes. Oh, we did receive one bottle of Evian on the first day and they did offer us a $40 food coupon which is a joke because of all the restrictions it comes with, like it is only valid at the 3 most expensive restarurants on-site and only for dinner. I could eat like a king for 1/2 the money down the street at Cafe O'Lei. Oh, they did offer to upgrade us to their \"Napua Lounge\" for just $200 more per day... they must think we are stupid or something! 4. The housekeeping staff is not up to par compared to some of the other luxury hotels we have stayed in. They DO NOT replenish the toiletries or clean the tub everyday. We had to call housekeeping twice, during our stay, to get our coffee (one of the few \"free\" items in the room). Mind you, this is after leaving a nice tip on the counter every morning! To be fair, the property is grand and has a wonderful beach. However, it is an older property and its age is showing.

The suite was incredible with two bathrooms, and very spacious. We participated in the free yoga at 8am on the lawn overlooking the ocean. Their were about 15 people. The breakfast buffet is awesome and worth the $28 per person (no kidding!) The food is wonderful and if you can sit and relax and enjoy the best view in the house (overlooking fountains and dolphin sculptures and the waves) you are doing what you came there for.

When else will you be at one of the top ten spas in the world? Experience the luxury. All the spa prices on the island are high (and within 10 bucks of each other), you may as well do it at one of the #1 spots in the world. It is, indeed, an \"over the top\" spa experience. We ate at the four seasons (Ferraros) the meal was good, as I would expect, but not \"exceptional\". (I am a foodie.)The portions are on the smallish side and the price is consistent with the four seasons. View of the sun setting on the ocean is great though. Mama's fish house (on the road to Hana) had the best food on the island (and the largest price tag). It really is $16 for a cocktail! The desserts were amazing though, as well as the fresh fish caught locally. We did breakfast at the Maui Prince, the food was equal to the G.W. but the view was not. It is $20 if you stay at the hotel, $25 if you do not. The gem in Wailea was Tommy Bahama's cafe at the Wailea Shops. The food was great, the service was fine and the price was reasonable. We returned several times. The snorkeling in front of the Prince (Mekena Beach) had some great fish, and a turtle, but not as good as Black Rock in front of the sheraton in Kaanapali. Big beach is beautiful, and is a nice \"walk\" with your loved one if you are a good walker.

Upon our arrival, the management informed us that we were being upgraded to Ho'olei, the brand-new complex of $3.5 million condos across the street. The condos at Ho'olei are nothing short of amazing - two levels with marble floors, glass walls with views of the ocean, upstairs and downstairs patios with seating and dining areas, fully stocked kitchen with granite countertops, elevator, garage, and private pool/hot tubs/workout facility. In addition, every condo is unique, and it is obvious that much care that went into furnishing and decorating these spaces. (However, we still had full access to the grounds of main resort , and visited frequently during our stay.) The grounds at Ho'olei and the Grand Wailea are breathtaking - everything is clean and extremely well-maintained, with luxurious greenery and beautiful statuary. The main activity pool is warm, spacious, and brilliantly designed so that you never feel crowded. (And we weren't the only adults trying out the water slides, water elevator, and rope swing!) The adults-only pool is continuously heated (like bathwater!), has incredible views of both the hotel and the ocean, and staff scrupulously maintains the 18+ age limit. We never had a problem finding lounge chairs. The beach is sparklingly clean, and chairs are readily available. The staff, both at Ho'olei and the Grand Wailea, was friendly, knowledgeable, and fully accommodating. I wonder if we were staying at the same resort as some of the other reviewers ... we commented several times at the high level of service. (For example, we visited the adult pool late at night, and Housekeeping was more than happy to find us poolside and bring us towels within 10 minutes of our phone call.) Given the enormous size of the resort, we were impressed at how frequently we ran into staff who went out of their way to make our stay wonderful - giving directions, sharing recommendations for dining or activities around the island, or stopping to pick us up in a golf cart to take us down to the beach. This is not a hotel where staff will continuously be at your elbow to assist you (we got lost on the way to the restaurants several times), but staff were readily available -and always knowledgeable- when we stopped to ask a question. And please don't forget your manners, or hesitate to strike up a conversation with staff - we got some great advice (and heard some great stories) from the bartender at the swim-up bar! The only \"downside\" we saw is that the resort is so beautiful and accommodating, you may forget to explore the Maui outside its grounds ... remember to get off the property and explore!

The gardens of the hotel are the highlight as they obviously spared no expense in landscaping the grounds. The hotel is a masterpiece. The open air lobby is magnificent and the fitness center is the nicest I have ever seen in a hotel. The problem is you pay a heavy price to stay here and I am not sure it is worth it.

We still paid 400 dollars a night, plus multiple fees were added on including an 18 dollar a day \"resort fee\" supposedly to cover our access to the swimming pools and fitness center. The food and drink prices are prohibitively expensive. They charged my children 8 dollars each for a frozen lemonade at the pool restaurant. A minimal lunch for 3 was over 70 dollars (at the pool). We ended up eating every meal at restaurants in Kihei. They even charged us 25 dollars to rent a small fridge for the week as the rooms have a fridge, but it is full of high priced snacks and drinks and is locked unless you opt for the \"self service bar\" option. The rooms were nice, but not exceptional for the price. The swimming pools were so cold that it was unpleasant to swim in them. There were no organized pool activities and no drink service at the pools. The beach was great and well maintained. The staff was pleasant but not overly friendly.

The spa was gorgeous but if you get a massage they get you in and out of there like a factory, fyi. My beef was with the lack of service! Checkin was fine but things started going downhill once I got to my room. There was -- I'm not making this up -- a piece of chewed gum stuck to my headboard. I don't know if it was the past guest or the maid's herself. Then I paid $50 for a mini cabana by the ocean only to have no service whatsoever. I had to keep getting up to walk to the bar -- through the kiddie pool, mind you, and over a bridge -- I had to REALLY work for those margaritas! Everything I called from my room for I had to wait for the phone to ring 10 times, sometimes it was never answered. The place seemed very shortstaffed and I was disappointed overall. But here's the FUNNY part... So finally the fifth night i was getting pretty unhappy and took a walk down the beach path and realized that next door was the Four Seasons. I walked into the gorgeous property and up to the front desk and inquired about a room.

This year my conference had it's meetings at the hotel. Usually I have always stayed at the now defunct Renaissance Hotel 2 hotels north. For all the hype I've heard and the prices, I was expecting to be wowed. Unfortunately I was underwowed. I am a Diamond member within the Hilton Hotel system and the front desk notified me that I was upgraded to a deluxe ocean view for which I am grateful. When I asked where self parking was, they told me \"a quarter mile down the road\". This wasn't as bad as it sounded as you can walk most of it through the hotel. The bad part is there is very little parking and the spaces are sized for Mini Coopers. I was glad I turned down the upgrade to a Cadillac as I would never have parked. Vallet parking is $20/night. I arrived to my room on the 7th floor of the Wailea wing at the distal third of the wing. Nice view of the ocean and quiet until last night when a noisy family arrived above me at midnight. The room was spacious and has a nice marble bathroom and tub. 2 robes are provided, but no slippers. I've never been to a Hilton here in the states or around the world that didn't have slippers. When I called housekeeping they said slippers \"were only for VIPs\", but they brought me some anyway. Being a diamond member (which is the highest level of Hilton's frequent guest program) apparently didn't count. The Waldorf-Astoria collection is part of the Hilton Family. The coffee in the room and at the Grand Dining room is truly awful. The second worst coffee I've ever had after a Holiday Inn in Souzhou, China. My next problem was the internet connection. I spent about 3 hours with Lodgenet (the hotel's internet support in Atlanta, GA) and 2 of the engineering employees here at the hotel. Finally, we took my computer to the next room that worked perfectly and the engineer took that modem and placed it in my room and I finally had service. The engineer here at the hotel didn't seem to understand computers very well, and the support staff at Lodgenet couldn't figure out the issue. The breakfast buffet came with my room and the setting is beautiful overlooking the grounds and ocean. A egg bar is there for personalized eggs of any sort. There is a Japanese bar with miso soup, rice and condiments. Hot foods with sablefish alternating without another fish which are both overcooked and dry. Sliced potatoes alternating with hash browns, Bacon, and a meat hash. There is also waffles, fruit selections, salad ingredients and some really good smoked salmon daily. Breads are massed produced and taste like it. The buffet is $28/person.The day I arrived the major pools were shut down for renovation and only the Hibiscus Pool is currently open. There are 2 jacuzzis with this open until 10PM. The beach is one of the best on Maui. Unfortunately, being at the front of the property from the pool down to the beach is also the area that you can hear the generators for the workers. They are there everyday during all daylight hours. If you want to enjoy the beach and not hear construction noise you can walk to the Fairmont further south (the Four Seasons next store shares the same beach and has the same noise pollution). Otherwise, you can go north to the beach that was in front of the Renaissance. This is pretty deserted because the hotel is now closed. The staff is friendly and the housekeeping staff is cleaning my rooms well. As the previous reviewer noted, I also haven't received bar soap since my last one was used. The scented Mango/coconut lotion/shampoo etc smells good, but the shampoo made my hair feel \"rough\" and not clean. Overall, I am enjoying my stay after getting around all the hiccups, but to me the physical plant is similar to what the Renaissance was, not anything better. I checked out the Marriott next store and was disappointed. They had sold the Renaissance and moved here, but the rooms, amenities, quality is not at the level the Renaissance was. The Grand Spa they say is rated the best spa in the US by Conde Nast. Once again I was expecting to be wowed, and wasn't. It is very similar to the California Burke William Spas, but more expensive of course.

The kids pool area has 7 pools, connected by water slides and it's an absolute heaven for kids and it was even fun for me too. Grand Wailea has a separate pool area just for adults so if you are not traveling with children you would not be annoyed by somebody else's kids screaming and running next to you. And don't forget a very nice and easy access to the beach right from the pool area (don't be fooled by great pictures from the hotel's websites, Marriott for example - even though this hotel stays right on the ocean it does not have a beach! Instead of the nice and soft sand they have huge rocks and it's impossible to take a swim - you would have to go someplace else). I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends!

Our room was large, and we were extremely pleased with the upgrade to oceanview. The hotel grounds are expansive and it can seem overwhelming at first trying to figure your way around. I was concerned that being there over Thanksgiving would yield a big crowd of screaming kids, but the pool areas and the beach were pleasant and happy - family oriented to be sure, but not annoying. No trouble getting beach chairs, towels or with finding a space to sun yourself for the day. We did self parking and had no trouble at all - I thought from reading the reviews that the parking would be miles away from the hotel - self parking was an easy thing to manage, even with luggage and lots of towels and bags. One of the best travel experiences that I ever had. We are planning to return for our family vacation soon! My only gripe is the 25.00 per day resort fee.

A less expensive, yet tasty, option for breakfast or lunch is the little cafe located amidst the hotel's many interesting shops. In addition to all this, the hotel hosts daily free activities (i.e. yoga on the beach) and the concierges are very informative. They sent us to Mama's Fish House on the North Shore for lunch. It was very pricey but we enjoyed the best meal of our entire vacation here. We also rented surf boards and tried paddle surfing. That was lots of fun and the rental staff was very helpful! The pool at the hotel is great - we felt like kids again going down the water slide and swinging from the rope swing - and the beach is really nice too. You can see sea turtles and tropical fish just a few feet off of the shoreline. There is also a shore walk that offers great views of the coast in either direction from the hotel.

When picking our hotel we noticed a huge difference in what you would get for $100 or $200/night less. It's like night and day. If you're going to Hawaii, you have to know that everything is expensive. You also should plan ahead and decide where you want to spend the bulk of your money. For us, we wanted a beautiful place to stay and to be able to do lots of activities. We stayed here on our honeymoon. Upon arrival, we automatically got upgraded to a nicer room. Our room had that nice Polynesian feel and backed onto one of the pools. We were on the ground floor, which turned out to be really nice because we could leave our room and head to the pool right from our sliding door. The hotel grounds are like nothing I've ever seen before. They have multiple pools on different ground levels with slides going from one pool to another. They have beautiful flowers everywhere and tropical birds chirping all the time. There is not enough space to describe it all so I'm going to post a few of my pictures. They have a few restaurants at the hotel but we only took advantage of the Cafe for breakfast. They have muffins, toast and typical egg breakfasts there. Aside from that we didn't eat at our hotel because we saw the prices online and we didn't want to spend a lot on food. Instead, we took advantage of some local places. The room was nice but we didn't want to spend all of our time in the room. We used the pools and slides a lot, and spent a good deal of time on the beach. The water is really warm and the sand is very fine. It's beautiful. We spoiled ourselves and took advantage of the spa there. We got a couple's massage. It was pricey, about $400 for the both of us but well worth it. When you book it, they ask the both of you to come in an hour earlier so that you can take advantage of their soaking spas. They had a mud bath, a papaya bath, aromatherapy bath and two other that I can't remember right now. It was so nice and relaxing.

After a very long and arduous journey from Boston, arrived and were a bit disappointed to not be given the requested ocean view room--as well the room we were given had 2 queens instead of a king. However, upon seeing the gorgeous room we were given, we were immediately delighted with the room we got. It was one of the newly remodeled rooms and it was really beautiful-large, nicely decorated, extremely clean with a fabulous bathroom and a lovely balcony. The beds were very comfortable---loved the feather beds on the mattress. We were in the Molokai wing facing out toward the guest parking lot yet still having a slight view of the ocean. It was a perfect location because it was convenient to get to our rental car in the parking lot as well as a very short walk to the beach, pool, lobby and even gym. The hotel is stunningly beautiful--the entrance lobby is open to the outside and ornately decorated, and filled with lovely fountains and pretty gardens. As well, the hotel has an impressive art collection out in the open--loved the Legers! The outside gardens are just as beautiful. The pools, the beach everything is just lovely. Sept. must be the best time to visit as the hotel was not crowded in the least. You never had to hunt for a place to sit around the pools or on the beach. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the housecleaning staff did a wonderful job. While at the hotel, I took an intro diving course which I really enjoyed--it enabled me to join my husband on a boat dive. We also snorkled a lot, and there was a lot to see just snorkling off the hotel's beach. We also drove to Makena and snorkled off the beach in TurtleTown which was awesome. We also took advantage of the gym--a really nice facility--excellent equipment and spinning classes. We didn't eat at the hotel--aside from getting coffee and muffins at the Kula cafe in the morning. There are so many fabulous restaurants in Kihei and much cheaper as well. Our favorite was Sansei--best sushi we've ever had. I can understand how a visit the the Grand Wailea could easily turn wretched--it appears in the busy months it does turn into a Disney World of sorts and if one had to put up with huge crowds and screaming kids, I don't think it would be so pleasant. Particularly when it is so extremely expensive. As well, while we were there, the staff was plentiful and constantly around, cleaning or tending the gardens etc. I can see the staff being overwhelmed with a full hotel. We got a considerable discount because of the conference and a weeks stay still ran us $3000.00--this is not a cheap place to stay. Luckily our experience was a wonderful one. For the money it costs to stay there, everyone's visit should be as wonderful. So if you go, don't go in the busy season, make sure you get a renovated room and enjoy to the fullest!

I think the price you pay should be relative to what you get. The hotel is overrated. It seems like they put all the money, near $500 a night they charge the customers with the upkeep of the exterior of the hotel and fell short with the actual rooms. We were assigned a room that was a bit of a walk to the beach and pool area. Our room's view was facing the self parking. If you are a very light sleeper like I am, try not to get a room assigned on this side. In the morning you can kind of hear the trucks making their deliveries around 6am! The room itself, looks outdated. It is not terrible, its just descent. We expected more for the price. The hotel should put the money renovating their rooms. In regards to food, the only time we ate at the hotel was for breakfast from the cafe. The food lacked flavor. I ordered a waffle and my husband ordered a breakfast platter. It consists of eggs, sausage, bread roll, and a cup of rice. We didn't even order any drinks and we paid about $38. Again, the price is definitely NOT relative to the overall stay.

I, too, was a bit nervous about what to expect after reading about all the bad experiences. Our five nights at the GW were courtesy of HHonors (250,000 points). When you use HHonors points, the resort fee is waived. As a Diamond member, I also received an upgrade from a terrace view to a deluxe ocean view, and a $40 restaurant credit (which we ended up not using). I believe the fact that I was not paying for this hotel changed my perception of it, but I can tell you that our stay was amazing on so many levels. We were told by many that September is their slowest month. There were no battles for pool chairs or long lines or loud youngsters. The weather was absolute perfection. I don't think I'd ever stay at the GW during the high season. September, however, is a perfect time to plan a trip. The lobby and lobby bar is so overwhelming and absolutely beautiful. We did NOT receive the welcome lei. Just seemed like no one remembered to do it. At check in, we were told the only rooms available had two queen beds. We wanted (and I thought I had guaranteed) a king. After some back and forth, the front desk agent told us the two beds could be pushed together and they had special linens to turn it into a 'California king.' Okay. We'll try that. This ended up being one of the funniest and most memorable parts of our vacation. The combined beds were absolutely enormous! One huge, supersized bed in the middle of the room! It was unusual at first, but very comfortable and by the end of the trip we were spoiled by such excess. The room was very comfortable (although we were not in a newly renovated room). We had a beautiful, big lanai with the most spectacular view. The bathroom was huge and luxurious. Did the room show its age? A bit, I guess, but the room seemed well cared for and not particularly worn or dated. In fact, we didn't even realize we were in an older room until we saw the flat-panel TVs in the new rooms. The bath gel, shampoo, conditioner was wonderful. The pool and common areas were also really amazing. We enjoyed time at the pool almost every day. There was no pressure to arrive early. We would get to the pool at 11a, or sometimes even after Noon. Chairs were readily available. We always sat near the adult pool and it was a calm and pleasant oasis. Service was prompt and friendly and the drinks were potent! The slides were fun, and worth trying once even if it's not your thing. We did not have any meals at the hotel. Too many better options outside. We did have a small breakfast at the coffee shop one day, and it was fine. We might have had a snack by the pool. We drank plenty, at the pool and the lobby bar. The bartenders were real friendly and talkative. We enjoyed their company -- not too intrusive, just the right mix of professionalism and friendliness. Also, we enjoyed $5 mai tais at the Humuhumu bar between 5p and 6p. Great for sunsets. We did enjoy an amazing afternoon at the spa. Everything said about the spa is right on. The terme treatment was really different and was an added value. My massage was great and totally worth the cost. We ended up canceling a second round of spa appointments later in the week at the Four Seasons because we were still so relaxed from our Spa Grande experience. Never had a problem getting the car from valet. We called and it was there waiting for us by the time we arrived. Asked a couple of simple questions to the concierge, and they seemed friendly and competent. We rented snorkel gear one day and swam right off the beach. The staff was very friendly and at $8 for an hour, it was a pretty good deal. One key to enjoying your stay is to use your feet and walk to the neighboring resorts. We visited the Four Seasons a couple of times. We had a nice breakfast there and the most AMAZING dinner at Spago (followed by drinks at the bar). We walked to the Shops at Wailea for breakfast at Longhi's. We drove into Kihei for the most amazing sushi at Sensei. The hotel's own dining options weren't really appealing in the face of so many other great options outside. Another key to enjoying your stay is to EXPECT everything to be very expensive. I get the sense that a lot of reviewers have a negative experience because of the cost of everything. Yes, everything costs a LOT -- it's Maui! If paying $12 or $15 for a drink will ruin your vacation, this is simply not the place for you. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the GW.

Secondly, the place is showing its age (mouldy balconies, bird-dropping-stains). thirdly, you need to walk a really long distance to get around -- the front desk, the eating areas, the pick-up points (more than one), the pools -- are all far apart, and confusingly not on the same floor.

So we pulled around just enough to let our bags out so my boyfriend could park the car as I wait and we got hounded to give them our keys. We told them what we were doing but didn't want to listen, just wanted the keys. I got annoyed at this point, just listen!!Geez, he made it a bigger deal then what it was.

You won't get you lei greeting, but even getting dropped off in the front I dfidn't get mine and everyone I saw coming in after me didn't get there's either. They were to busy to notice. The check in was fast and our room was ocean front view. Not bad I suppose, i would have perferred to go higher but those were different class I heard. Besides that wasn't sure but they were updating all of the rooms. So maybe they weren't available. We stayed at the pool. I am not so much a pool person but really enjoyed it. The lazy river to the slides and the the bar pool. It was all really impressive. The best on the strip of hotels I would have to stay. We went walking past a few other hotels as well as stoped in the Marriot for the Luau and the Prine for Snorkel and all there pools were NOTHING in comparrison to this one. Kid friendly. I was a bit word reading about that thinking was my romantic vacation going to be ruined by a bunch of out of control kids. No, not at all. It was down season so I am not sure if that polay a part but it was perfect time for us to go out of the year. I read about how hard it is to get a seat at this pool, it was not so hard at all for us. We ate at the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a, there food was really delish! It was off the chart but nothing to complain about either. They also make you pay a $25a day fee for cleaning which I was already aware of from reading reviews previously. So I made sure to take advantage of them cleaning the room everyday. No problems with that and they did a good job. The bed was super comfy but the pillows really sucked. I hated them! Also, FYI...around 5AM every morning the birds out front would all chirp their hearts away. It was so bad I seriously couldn't fall back to sleep. SO if your a light sleeper you might want to find a way to not have your room where the tree's are. To be honest, I don't really see so muhc of the point of wasting mor emoney on a ocean view. The ground is cheaper, closer to whereever you want to walk to (especially the pool) and you get a nicer TV. Don't know how that worked out but they had way nicer TV's!!

Check in was easy - we got upgraded to an deluxe ocean room (as the points get you a terrace room) - not sure if the upgrade was b/c of the Hilton Diamond or b/c of our honeymoon but either way, I was happy. We got room 8081 - and it has a perfect view of the ocean - it was smack dab in the middle - we had one of the best views I believe - the room was spacious and the bathroom huge! You could tell it was a bit dated but it was clean and still very elegant. The pools were amazing - since we were there in low season, the pools were basically empty everytime we went.

Our room was always cleaned by 12-1pm and it was done well- for one of our turn down services, they filled our tub with bubbles and flowers, had towels in the shape of swans and also made a heart with flowers on our bed. I suspect this was b/c of our honeymoon and it was a great surprise. We also had 2 sessions at the Spa grande. We had body scrubs and duo massages on a seperate occasions. We were then able to enjoy the therme baths tiwce. Overall it was nice. It was VERY expensive and I dont know if I would pay for that again. perhaps I dont really enjoy the \"spa\" as much as other people but it was a great treat I suppose anyway. The internet was included - but it was PAINfully slow. I gues you don't go on vacation to be on the internet but when I wanted to look something up quickly, it was very annoying. We did the valet parking on one night and then decided to self park - our room was equal distant from the valet and the self park so walking to the self park was not a huge issue. The card slider in the self park doesn't work very well so something we spent 5 minutes just trying to get in! But it worth saving the 20 bucks +tip a day and spending it elsewhere. Overall, I thought we got a great deal out of the hotel as we didn't really pay for another other than the spa. I was pleased with the upgrade and that we were treated well even though we weren't really paying customers. I dont know if I would pay 500-600 per night for this hotel - at that price I would stay at the Four Seasons as I have heard great things about them - I would maybe pay 300 per night for this hotel but that's about it. I can see how people complain about being nickled and dimed everywhere - I mean you can basically avoid a lot of it but with a resort of this size and \"prestige\" and price - I would expect more.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cFANTASTIC hotel!\u201d", "Author": "trvlbg123", "ReviewID": "UR20130174", "Content": "This resort was absolutely amazing!

We never had to wait to eat at any of the restaurants, and although they were expensive, they were all very good, and the service was fantastic!

I'm not going to say we are exceedingly well travelled, but we have stayed in many nice hotels, have made numerous trips to tropical locations, and like upscale accomodations. We are empty nesters, so we have travelled with kids of all ages but this trip was for us alone - for our wedding anniversary. We took the advice of close friends who stay here often, and gave it a try. We LOVED the Grand Wailea. Here is why. Accomodations: Some people say the hotel needs updating, and perhaps so. But it doesn't feel \"aged\", it is being remodeled wing by wing, and it is still quite beautiful. Our room was lovely with lots of room, wonderful bedding, a large and lovely bathroom (I LOVE that) with both a large glassed in shower and a jacuzzi tub. Our balcony was roomy and comfortable with an outstanding view. The room was always clean as can be. Service: Was outstanding. Every single person we ever walked by who was on staff said a friendly \"Aloha\". This was literally without exception. We never had one single negative experience. We had rented a Cabana at the pool for a treat and would you believe it was the only windy and rainy day. What a disappointment. We called front desk manager thinking that even though they can't control the weather they should at least give us a discount on a different day. They took the entire charge off our bill. I asked for an ottoman for our balcony like I saw on the lower floors and it arrived in minutes. By our 3rd day there, without really having significant interaction staff was already calling us by name. In this huge place! Staff was just very attentive. From our Lei greeting to our bellman to valet to the gardeners and on and on. Special touches: They knew it was our anniversary so the first night instead of normal \"turn down\" service our bath was filled with bubble bath and fresh flower petals, and our towels made into 2 swans ending in a heart shape! Location: the beachfront location cannot be beat. The sunsets are gorgeous with lots of people sitting on the lawn to enjoy them at night. It is just a beautiful setting, with the grounds kept emaculately. Pools: Beautiful. We spent our entire time at the adult pool even though the other pools and swim up bar are lovely. We worried about reserving chairs but it was never that crowded. Granted, times are tough economically and we ended up being there JUST as everyone was returning home for the school year, so the occupancy wasn't high. Still the pool was so fun, the service there outstanding, the people friendly, and there was lots of room. We spent the majority of our time at the pool and loved it. And the nice lawn stretches straight out from the pool to the great little beach and the ocean right there. Spa: We have been to a few spas and this is probably the nicest one. It is expensive no doubt, but the \"hydrotherapy baths\" ahead of your appointment were really great. Didn't know we would like that but it was really cool. A sauna, steam room, several jacuzzis, 5 japanese soaking tubs with different purposes, and on and on. Food: We really didn't eat at any restaurant except Bistro Malakini (sp?) and it was great. We'd read all the negative reviews so we went off property for dinners. However we stayed in the Napuaa tower and it was worth the extra cost. We had complimentary breakfast each morning and open bar/appetizers each evening and it was outstanding. We were too full for dinner several nights. We also had room service and it wasn't outstanding but pretty good. Concierge: Not so great, but we only used the service in the Napua tower. Maybe if we'd gone to front desk where there are numerous staff on hand to help you we would have had better luck. We asked for 3 things of the Napuaa Conceirge service and got 1 of the 3, the other 2 just didn't get taken care of. Our only complaint is that this hotel is still awfully high priced. Even for the level of service and the nice accomodations, given the occupancy I would think the price would be a bit lower. We had a wonderful trip to Maui, and whether you have kids of all ages or are empty nesters like us, you are going to have a fantastic stay at the Grand Wailea. Just relax and enjoy.

We had fun and Courtney Love was by the pool while we were there. Funny, Love didn't look like she was having fun - maybe it was the break-in period for her new carbon fiber permalip implants. The hotel was EMPTY (I was told 30 % occupancy by hotel staff). Two entire wings of the hotel were closed. We stayed there the previous year during the same week and the hotel was at 80%. Must be the gas prices as it's a looong drive to Maui from California (FYI: a California driver's license is required when checking into the Grand Wailea) ; ) I have been coming to the Grand Wailea since the first year it opened and have stayed at a multitude of other hotels and condos on the island over the years. Whenever I have complete financial amnesia, I find myself wandering into the Grand Wailea and staying for a few nights. The rooms start at about $400 and go wayyyy north from there. If you live in Hawaii, you can get the locals only discount at $300 per night. Since a gallon of milk costs $9 and a frozen lemonade by the pool costs the same, the locals are cleaned out well before they arrive in Wailea. Now to the review: Check in was a breeze, the pools were warm and clean and the slides fast with no waiting. The waterpark is still the best. The lazy river slide was under repair for a day and after the repair, I slid down and burned my thigh on the newly repaired spot, a little pain lets you know your still alive you know. The staff was very friendly and I only saw one skirmish. A gentleman - Morty we'll call him - was complaining that he had his towels and book removed from the lounges that he staked out at 3am while dressed in his Ninja outfit (the hotel has a 1 hour limit on unoccupied towels in order to keep the place tidy). Mort really got into the face of this young Hawaiian kid working there - poor kid could do nothing but listen to the blathering. The kid finally removed his headphones and found the guy two more chairs that were suitable out of the couple hundred that were still available as nobody was within 3000 miles Maui that week. The place still rocks even though there were a few years where maybe the service and the cleanliness was in question.

I thought our room was a nice size with a giant bathroom that included a tub and a walk in shower big enough for two, a desk and a comfortable seating area. The balcony was nice and faced the ocean, but there was a smaller building in front of us that partially obstructed our views. Being forced to valet park when we got there was annoying, especially when I knew there was free parking available. We were greeted with leis, which was really cool. Check in was easy, but I did have to remind the front desk agent that employees do not have to pay for the resort fee twice. I asked where the free parking was and it was pointed to on a map that was the size of two business cards. Tiny! I thought our agent could have been a little more welcoming. When we retrieved our car, the valet guy drove extremely fast in the parking garage. I did not like this one bit! The hotel has great pools and a GREAT beach that has been voted one of the best in the world in previous years. We didn't spend much time here as we were traveling around the island most days. The one day that we did spend at the beach the umbrellas were $35 for the day - a bit excessive, but they were huge and the chairs were complimentary. The beach seems private and it wasn't crowded. Great views of the sunset can be found here. My suggestion about the cost of the umbrella - buy a $10 one at Walmart near the airport. The grounds of the hotel were huge and I loved all of the different foiliage around. It seemed to be kept up. If you are a light sleeper, I would not recommend this hotel to you. The hotel is set up with the doors outside like a motel. The hallways are all tile - very noisy when suitcases or bellman carts are going over them. We also could hear our upstairs neighbors open and close their balcony door (at 5am!) everyday. What I was shocked about was how high the food was at the hotel. We never ate at any of the restaurants because of prices, but we did visit the Cafe Kula for coffee and a few light meals. I ended up getting a cold while we were there and got soup from the Cafe two nights for dinner. That wasn't horribly expensive, but when they charged $4 for a 20 oz. bottle of soda, I was stunned. It's probably the cheapest alternative if you are looking to not spend a fortune at every meal. No vending on the floors either. No fridge in our room either. Free parking lot was a 10 minute walk which wasn't bad. We'd probably have waited that long to get the car from valet. There was free internet (dial-up) which I was surprised, but very happy about. Overall, I like the hotel. I work in a very high-end Hilton, so I was able to see the pros and cons of this property. I thought the grounds were pretty, the beach was great and overall we had a nice stay. Service was decent, but could have been better. Like many resort hotels, they do nickle and dime you.

Management should take a dip and go down the slides and floating river (trash and missing tiles on the slides).

My husband, daughter (3 years old) , son (8 months) and my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, grandmother and brother and his family were also there. We had a room far away from our other family members which was both nice and a pain at the same time. Unfortunately for us we arrived in Maui smack dab in the middle of a 2 week tropical storm and pretty much spent the week in clouds and lots of rain. This however was ok and hey it is Hawaii so it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be that bad right? We survived a major tropical storm that pounded the resort and knocked out electricity for one and a half days. Half of the resort was flooded, some ground floor rooms started taking in water, the pools were closed almost the entire stay and the sand at the beach was totally gone during this day and a half. As you can see it was a very brutal (and uncommon) storm. Pros: The hotel is located in a beautiful area, to me Wailea is much more quiet and nice than Kannapali (sp?). The beach was beautiful (pre storm and post storm once the currents brought the sand back) and the water is a beautiful color. Our room was on the 2nd floor and had a gorgeous view of the ocean. We loved to sit out on the lanai and watch the ocean and listen to the waves. Our room had a king bed (very comfy) and a pull out couch and the bathroom was really big and nice. I loved the complimentary toiletries and usually I am not into these. They just smelled really nice and the lotion was great, like I said not a big deal to most people;) We ordered a fridge for the week (cost $25) and before driving to the resort we stopped off at Costco and stocked up on water, soda and snacks. This was so nice to have cold drinks for everyone and this is a resort which obviously means not only Hawaiian prices but resort Hawaiian prices:) Just come prepared for the cost of food and you will really enjoy your trip. The first day we had sticker shock and towards the end of the vacation we would get our lunch bill (for 2 hamburgers with fries and 2 sodas) and say oh good that meal was only $40- bargain! Cons: Valet parking is very expensive if you are staying the week, I want to say $15 a day plus tip but the self parking is ridiculous! It is really really far away and there are not that many spots available so you are sort of forced to use the valet. The hotel definitely needs some freshening up, it looked outdated but we were told they were in the process of renovating. The breakfast buffet was a nightmare and there was always a line wrapped around the courtyard (in the copious rain). We always ended up eating at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 for breakfast and the food there was ok. They had a really good pizza deal there for dinner- 1 large pizza, 2 drinks and cinnamon twists for $25. The pools were only open the first day we were there and they closed a few hours after we arrived and due to checking in and me watching my baby I never got to use the pools. Boohoo. My husband took my daughter and said the slides, swings and water elevator were fun. Unfortunately with all the rain/flooding the pools remained closed for the rest of the week. The service at this hotel was not so great, all the staff seemed surly. They of course were surprised by the severity of the storm and the power going out but they could have handled it much better. It was kind of chaotic at best and many guest were irate and left the hotel. In conclusion I loved Wailea, storm and all, but if I returned I would probably stay at the Four Seasons. The rooms look nicer and their pool is built up higher, so if there was another storm the pool would not have to close for the week.

I had done extensive research on the hotel and read countless reviews. I was somewhat wary having read about the mediocre food and rooms. I came away very impressed and was exceedlngly happy with our vacation at the hotel. We stayed in the Napau area of the hotel. We arrived at about 1:00 pm, and were told by the very polite desk staff that the room would be ready in an hour. We hung out at the bar until then - and were unpacked and ready to enjoy the place by 3:00. Our room was beautful with a giant bathroom - very clean and well maintained. The balcony with ocean view was perfect. Staying on the Napua level allowed us to take advantage of the morning breakfasts and the afternoon 'happy hour'. The food was always good with different selections every day. The pool is the main reason to come to the Grand Wailea. It is the best, period. Nothing else can compare. Only dig is it gets hard to find chairs quickly - so you need to scout out and find a good spot early. But it pays off. My wife and kids would sleep in and I'd walk down to the pool by 7:00 and grab our chairs - then just read for a bit until they were ready. The other outstanding feature of the hotel is the Spa. Not to be missed. Make sure you book a massage. Just soooo worth it. Extremely dedicated and professional staff. Also tried the facial and that was excellent. We ate the first night at Humunukunukuaua's and really had a good meal. Excellent fish. You will get bored with just eating at the hotel, so make sure you venture next door to the Wailea Shops. Tommy Bahamas was very good. There are other great restaurants as well. And there is an ABC Store right in the mall so you can pick-up goodies and not pay huge resort prices. Drop by Costco or Walmart on your way to the resort from the airport. We bought a case of bottled water and went through the whole thing during our stay. We did try out the hotel's luau one evening and had a very good time. The entertainment was wonderful. I would also highly recommend eating at Mama's Fish House over in Pai'a near the airport. It's very expensive - but the food is amazing. Best fish I've had almost anywhere - the Mahi Mahi was out of this world. The beach at the Grand Wailea is really awesome - beautiful. We rented kayaks and snorkeling gear a few days and just had a ball out in the ocean. Well worth it. And don't miss the wonderful walkway that meanders in front of the hotels along Wailea Beach. Excellent for night strolls or a quick jog (make sure you don't go in the late afternoon - you will get covered in knats). The gym at the hotel is top notch anwyay - lots of cardio machines - and the free weights were well maintained. The Grand Wailea pretty much has it all - we pretty much hung out at the pool and beach all week....extremely relaxing. If you have a family with kids, they will definiitely love the pool. If you are honeymooning or just a couple on a relaxing holiday, probably might want to check out the Four Seasons or Fairmont.

I still give this place a 3/5 because it is Hawaii and by that fact alone, it is paradise. I would only stay here again if it was for a conference at a big discounted rate. Otherwise, next time I would go back to the Kea Lani or go next store and try the Wailea Beach Villas which are beautiful inside. oh! in the ocean there is a trampoline that is very fun.

The resort is gorgeous. We pulled up and were greeted with leis, something I had been waiting for, for a week. I was under the mistaken impression that you were greeted with a lei when you got off the plane in Hawaii. No lei at the airport, but yes here, and they even have a nonflower one for boys. We had an oceanview room with two queen beds. The room was very nice. Beds were soft. There was a great chez lounge and a flat screen tv. The bathroom had a large tub and separate glass shower, and a potty closet. Our balcony had a beautiful view of the ocean and molokini crater. The bath products that they give you are fabulous, but they are $28 per bottle and up if you want to buy them. The pool at the Grand Wailea is the best pool I have ever seen! It is insane. There are all of these pools and you can start at the top pool and slide your way down to the large pools at the bottom. They are a ton of fun and great for any age. My parents even enjoyed them. They have a small lazy river, a tarzan rope swing, two large slides, and a water elevator (worth checking out, but not that exciting). There is a place to play water volleyball and a special pool for scuba lessons (though that will cost you extra). There is bar in the pool which I thought was awesome. I had always heard about those, but had never seen one. Now I've seen one, but it was so busy that I never got a drink there. There was only 1 bartender that day and we waited 15 minutes and he never got to us to take our drink order, so we decided we didn't need a $12 drink in the pool that badly. There are lots of hot tubs, a couple hidden in the grotto and two by the adult (hibiscus) pool. The pool is open 7am-10pm, but the slides and stuff are only open 10-5 which sucks because the pool is packed at those times. We regularly went before or after dinner b/c it was peaceful. Please note: It is very difficult to get a chair by the pool during high time. We saw some guy flip out on the staff b/c his stuff was moved. If you leave your stuff on a chair for more than an hour without coming back they will clean off the chair and put your stuff away. You could rent a cabana to avoid this, but it is $250, so not worth it unless you are spending the entire day there and have a party of 4 or more. If you are planning on spending the day at the pool and there are 4 of you then I would spring for the cabana. We only ate 1 meal at the resort b/c the prices were insane. We had $18 burgers at Bistro Molokini. I wasn't wowed. I had an $18 burger in Lahaina, but at least it was made with Kobe beef. We did find across the street at the Wailea Gold Golf Course Club House there was an excellent restaurant that was more reasonable and had excellent views of Molokini. It was about $10 for a full breakfast there. It was peaceful, beautiful and yummy. Definitely better than paying $11.50 for a sausage biscuit at the hotel. The spa at the Grand Wailea is the best spa I've ever been to and with the terme is actually the best bang for your buck on property. This was my favorite thing about the resort. (See my separate review of the spa.) The only thing I did not like about the resort was the walking. Our room had a great view, but it was super far from the lobby and ridiculously far from the parking garage. This place is not for those who cannot walk long distances! My father said this was his favorite resort ever, except for the parking. He couldn't believe this place would charge almost $1000 a night and make you walk over a mile to the car. Yes, I checked, according to my pedometer it was over a mile to the car. Do yourself a favor, suck it up and pay the ridiculous $20 a day for valet.

It was NOT for us. If you are the traveler who becomes agitated in densely populated theme and water parks, if you find coach class when flying similar to a Greyhound bus experience or if you have little patience for cattle call style meals, DO NOT STAY HERE. My husband and I have found salvation in chain hotels such as Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott during other trips when we were booked at hotels which didn't meet our standards. We are certainly not hotel snobs. However, we booked our 2 week long vacation at GW based on it's Waldorf Astoria affiliation. How can a hotel with a Waldorf Astoria affiliation be run like Disney World? How can an affiliation with such high standards be associated with GW? I don't know but I will explain in the following exactly what to expect when you stay at GW to help you determine if it's for you and your family. (I say family because you shouldn't dare stay at GW unless you're A. traveling with kids. B. a fan of other peoples' kids C. crazy.) To begin, I spent 45 minutes the day prior to our arrival in an effort to arrange for champagne and a cheese fruit plate as a surprise for my husband. We traveled 18 hours with our infant as well as the added fatigue of my pregnant status. I thought he would be pleasantly uplifted and surprised to find a treat in the room. After calling the hotel, being told they were busy with a breakfast rush and to fax my request- I did. I included my credit card number and the specific wine off their menu as well as my menu selection for cheese. No can do, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there. And yes, I called on my way to confirm they received my request. Next stop, breakfast. Two people, total, $80. Buffet, mediocre at best and cold. Enjoy the sparrows while you dine. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like Hitchcock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Birds. Enough said. It was literally a 15 minute walk to and from the beach/12 from pool. EACH WAY. Want shade? PAY. $50 for a beach umbrella, a day. $250 for a poolside cabana. Who knows how you get them, I heard it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a lottery. The pool reminded us of a water park in our hometown. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bumper to bumper and there are so many kids\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I have 3, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t misunderstand me but this was not relaxing. It was CHAOS. My husband calls it Wally World. Our room was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We had a room booked for $499 with the 7th night free and we were put in a partial ocean view which would have been in the $600\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. LOL It was supposedly recently renovated but it was definitely not. It was mildew-y in the bathroom, older looking tiles\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the carpet smelled and it was cramped. There was a lot of nickel and diming going on there. Aside from the resort fee, there are charges for a refrigerator in the room (for baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s milk), a crib, shade by pool or beach as mentioned above and anything else you can imagine they charge for, they do. I had visions of majestic views from my shaded poolside or oceanfront seat, being waited on all day and soaking in my tub at night. Well, the view was of 1000 kids running around, no servers in sight and I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dare soak in that tub. We left after the 2nd night and checked into the Four Seasons next door. We paid slightly more, $640 a night plus $18 in parking but it was worth every cent. Cabanas, shade, umbrellas- all included. Service is 5 star all the way. There was always somewhere to sit by the pool. The kids pool was nice enough for adults to use! The rooms were amazing and the extras were a nice touch: The included some diapers and Little Swimmers as well as all the necessary infant toiletries in the room. They spelled out our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name in little sponges in the bathtub. They provide cribs, changing tables, diaper genies, bottle warmers, strollers, infant tubs, whatever else you can think of free of charge. Frig in all rooms. What a switch. Like I said, GW may be for some but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for us. I appreciate the finer things in life but also live on a budget. When I travel, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be exhausted by the accommodations I have chosen, I want to unwind. GW wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t providing that for us and I am glad we left when we did.

Since the lowest priced hotel room cost more than our honeymoon suite in Tahiti, we were unpleasantly surprised at how extreme the add-on fees are at this hotel. We felt they easily could have added another $1,000 - $2,000 to our one week stay (and that's not counting any food) had we not been vigilant about them -- and being vigilant about them made our relaxing stay simply less relaxing. Some examples: - umbrella for your chairs at the pool: taken by 7 AM'ish (see more below) - umbrella for your chairs on the beach: $50 per day - pair of chairs with their own shade cover: $75 per day - cabana: $250 per day - in-room rollaway bed for your kid: $20 per day - in-room refrigerator for your kid's food / milk / whatever: $25 per stay - daily resort fee: $25 per day (happens at many hotels) - hotel food: ridiculous -- $50-75 per person for basic dinner is normal (happens at many hotels) Particularly noteworthy if you want some shade by the pool or on the beach... The hotel has literally 5-10'ish umbrellas by the pool (I'm not kidding) and none on the beach. Each can provide shade to a small number of chairs. The pool opens at 7 AM. If you are not there at 7 (not 7:30 or 8:00), you will almost certainly not get a seat under these umbrellas. That means that you need to pay between $50 and $250 per day to get shade. For a hotel of this class and price range, that was unpleasantly surprised. We were frustrated when to get to the pool at 8 or 9 AM and have no chance of sitting in the shade all day -- and it's a hot day. Additionally, there is ongoing construction in the hotel in the main lobby, the pool area, and one wing. The noise was bad enough (waking up our three year old during nap time two days in a row), that we changed rooms -- after a lengthy discussion with the hotel staff (who were genuinely friendly). If you love lazy rivers, there is one at the hotel. It's quite short. We misread the advertisements to think it was 2,000 feet long, which would've been great. It's the entire pool complex, including all pools, that is 2,000 feet long. Lots of pool to be sure - just not a super long lazy river.

The staff was all exceptionally friendly and helpful, even though the hotel was pretty full. They work hard at keeping it clean & special. The pool areas, spa & beach are the highlights- we left the hotel only once in 5 days. One of our best vacations ever! With that said, we did meet friends who weren't having quite the same experience- problems with the front desk, causing her to break down crying (our clerk was awesome, but we have experienced persnickity help there in the past)- the rooms in the Molokini wing are remote & many view the parking structure. They've gotten carried away with placing $300/day cabanas (awnings) around the pools, tieing up 8 lounge chairs each, leaving few chairs for the rest of the hurd, virtually none of which are in the shade. Probably trying to keep the pool from getting too crowded, since there seemed to be alot of people running off with sunburn after about 2 or 3pm each day. There also seemed to be alot of people bussed in from who knows where & large familes of locals fighting for pool space, mostly between about 10am & 3pm. If you want a couple of lounge chairs anyplace close to shade, you need to grab them by 8am or so & guard them the rest of the morning. Kindof weird. But I did notice the main pool attendant (walking around) helping people who couldn't find anything, especially those with babies. Watch the charges- we got charged for minibar items we never took. Tip- if you get tired of the hotel food/costs, you can take the stairs (between the valet garage in front & the waterfall), then walk 2 minutes to the Shops at Wailea- several good restaurants & the best deli on the island inside the Whalers Store, lower level middle. Also think about buying water-shirts (board shirts) at one of the shops there to wear over the upper half of your body for when you're stuck out in the sun, it's practical in cutting back how much you burn or suntan lotion you have to use, but also gaining in style now, believe it or not. Anyhow, this is certainly a wonderful place to spend a few days & having stayed at most of the Wailea area hotels, can't understand why this doesn't rank even higher with this site's reviewers. I'd favor the Grand Wailea above the overrated Four Seasons or the Marriott- the \"Wailea Villas\" is kindof a joke- fenced off, overpriced, errily quiet & all but abandoned outside of christmas break- the Kea Lani is nice with it's suite-like rooms & elaborate pools, but the Fairmont doubled the prices the minute they bought it- the Maui Prince is a bit remote & caters to tourists from Japan. None of these are really practical for the first-timer to Maui, except maybe for a honeymoon, as it doesn't make sense to pay this much & then abandon the hotel to do other stuff that one will want to do on the island. A good plan is to stay here for the first or last couple of days on a trip, then rent a nice condo (anywhere between Wailea & Kaanapali or Napili) for a week- so you're then free to enjoy the local flavor, drives around the island, snorkeling or diving, activities, & stocking up at the Costco (right next to the airport) for your breakfasts & lunches, bbq or cocktail hours or whatever, along with having more space to spread out.

We were served chilled water and frozen grapes and a fruit plate at the cabana. The pool side food was great and not horribly expensive. The kids had a blast on the tarzan swing, water elevator, lazy river and slides. There was enough to keep them busy all day. We even did the same things as the kids and had a blast. Just looking out at the beach from our cabana with a lava flow was paradise for me. Suggestion: cabana 16 is great location. You are next to towel desk, restroom, restaurant and incredible view of ocean and surroundings. We loved the fact that you can go back and forth from the beach to the pool in a matter of a minute. The beach is great for swimming and the kids even go to jump on a trampoline on the ocean and jump off into the water. Alot of fun for only $20 for the day.

However, I would say it is not worth it to pay for the ocean view room like we did @ $750 per night, because we never stayed in it.

On this trip it was only my wife and I. Next time i will bring my two children. I have never stayed in a resort as completely overwhelming in class as The Grand. Do know that it would be really tough to stay here on a budget. Everything, especially the food, is pricey. We checked in on Sunday, July 20th, and took advantage of the Sunday Brunch. It was $48 per person. It was amazing. The next day we ate Sushi at Kincha's. Two buffets and an additional Rainbow Roll, plus a tea and glass of wine and we walked out the door for $160. The sushi, even for a buffet, was as good as I have ever had. For lunch another day we ate at the pool and for two wraps, two bottle waters, one smoothie, a mixed drink, plus tip and we signed a ticket for $70. In case you are wondering, all of the food and drinks are tops, but you get what you pay for. The view from my 8th floor room was breathtaking of the grounds and ocean. My advice is to request a room on an upper floor. I have included pictures of the room and restroom and our view. The beds, pillows, and linens are very satisfying. There are no rooms in any of the buildings that don't face the ocean, but the lower the floor the more trees to look over. The Spa Grande is well worth every penny. For a 2:00 appointment they have you arrive at 1:00 to take advantage of all the other amenities that you have available. There are different baths, whirlpools, etc that are intended to help you relax before your massage or other. The service is very impressive. The pool is tremendous. If you are thinking if your children would be entertained at the Grand, you need to know the pool is like a miniature water park. There are slides, one as long as 180 feet, a rapids slide, a water elevator, zero entry for the little ones, and a volleyball net in the larger pool. Thre is a lazy river but bring you own floatation devices because they are not provided. Some comments about the pool being crowded made me fear not getting a chair. There was never a problem when my wife and I were ready to find a place. Reference my pictures for some views of the pools. By design the hotel's rooms are a comfortable distance from the pools. Upon my check in, while looking toward the back, you can't see the pools. It isn't too far, just hidden a bit. I will be going back to The Grand Wailea. I stayed three nights at a condo prior to my checking in to The Grand and the difference in overall experience was like winning the lottery. As a whole, my experience in the area stores and shops was not the friendliest experiences. I would say most tourist places employees get tired of people. The Grand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employees are there to serve you. The only inconvenience in staying here is that you have to go down to the 4th floor, walk across the lobby area to get to another elevator to get from the 4th floor down.

I am not one to complain and have never written a negative review but this one is a must. The value for this hotel is not worth the accommodations. I recently stayed for my honeymoon and was extremely excited upon arrival but unfortunately my excitement didn't last long. Upon arrival my husband and I were greeted with flower leis and the valet took care of our car and bags but didn't even take the time to point us in the right direction to the check in desks. Check in went fairly quickly although the bell man who assisted us with our bags could have been a little more friendly as some of his colleagues were. Upkeep was not were it should be for a hotel in the \"Waldorf Astoria\" class as the paint on many of the doors were chipped, scratched and looked very worn. Upon reaching our room, we were welcomed to a musty/mildewy smell and so-so accommodations. Upon mentioning it to the bellman he just shrugged his shoulders and said to talk to the desk. Being on our honeymoon, we tried to stay positive and freshened up, headed down to the desk on our way to explore the hotel/pool/beach. The desk sent housekeeping to \"freshen up\" the room while we were out which lasted for a couple of hours into the evening but ultimately the smell returned. To make a long story short, the musty/mildewy smell was so prevalent that it permeated all of our clothes and regardless of whether or not we wore an article of clothing during the honeymoon, we had to wash everything when we got home because they smelled like the hotel room. After my third trip to the front desk I was finally afforded the opportunity to speak with management but the only thing that was offered to us was a late check out which we had already arranged for. This was another annoyance... our keycards were deactivated despite the prior arrangements made so we had to go back to the front desk anyway and once we were back in the room, housekeeping knocked on our door multiple times to find out when we were leaving. Not everything was a negative though, the pool and beach (although crowded) were very nice and lots of fun! The Humuhumunukunukuapuaa restaurant was pretty good.

We tried to find 4 chairs closer to the beach but all the chairs were taken. A hotel employee advised we go to a higher level pool as chairs were more plentiful. We found two chairs and a pool security person materialized with two more chairs right next to the pool. There was also a pool/food porter taking orders for drinks and lunch. We spent all afternoon riding the water elevator, going down slides, playing water volleyball and my husband and I swam up to the Grotto bar for a drink where the bartender laughed and joked with the swimmers.

The room was marginal at best. For the same type of money it is much better to stay at the Cove at Atlantis in the Bahamas. I read the one review that stated that the Grand Wailea had the best pools...while great....they don't hold a candle to the Atlantis!! Everything was dated. The pool chairs were stained and the paint was all chipped off of the frames. The pool deck is not cleaned at night. Many times we would see menus, flip flops, etc from the previous day when we went out to claim our chairs in the a.m. I must admit that the chair game is frustrating. All of the good spots have been stacked out by 7-8 am. The overall impression (if you have stayed at a top resort elsewhere and know what to expect) is one of a tired old lady. Very rough around the edges. The slides were very dirty. There were water lines and scum on the ropes in the water.....again, it simply looked like no one within the organization was tasked to keep those areas/items in a fresh condition. I can go on and on (this is the first review i have ever taken the time to author, but i thought it was worth the time because i would hate for someone who travels less than we do to stay at this hotel and get deeply dissappointed)", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui, Hawaii, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort but pool is getting very crowded\u201d", "Author": "HawaiianStyle808", "ReviewID": "UR17200101", "Content": "Live on the island Played tourist for the night.

Of course, with a luxury hotel also comes a luxury price. Those wishing to stay here should also make sure to plan to spend extra for items that may be part of the normal room price at other places. For instance, if you have kids and want a microwave in your room, you can request one but at a $25 charge. If you want a refrigerator in your room, you can also request one at a $25 charge (they don't like you emptying out the in-room fridge of the stocked items). Valet parking is $20/night. Internet usage is extra as well. In a way, you feel like they are nickel and diming you to death for what you may already think is a fairly expensive stay for your family. If you are like us and the idea of a $2.50 banana or a $3 can of Coke seems outrageous, do yourself a favor and take a nice evening walk over to The Shops at Wailea and pick up some snacks and drinks at the ABC Store where you'll pay more standard HI prices. If you've got a rental car, drive 5 minutes to Kihei and you'll be able to find grocery stores there as well where $2.50 can get you a bunch of bananas rather than a single one. Outside of the on-property prices for food and goods, the property is a nice one. Our kids loved the kid's pool which wasn't too crowded while we were there in late May.

We stayed in the Napua Tower (our stay was free due to some connections). The room in Napua was lovely. Very clean and large. The bathroom was gorgeous and I LOVED the shampoo and conditioner they provided (I actually went and bought some in the little mall). We had turn-down service every night with a little flower and Hawaiin prayer. Breakfast in Napua was provided and it was very good. The pools are obviously the attraction here and they were amazing. You could spend all day just seeing all of the little nooks and crannies throughout the pools. We felt like kids on the water slides :). One complaint is that they really nickel and dime you with the chaise. A large tented lounge area would set you back hundreds of dollars and even an umbrella on the beach for the day was pricey (I forget the exact price and don't want to mis-speak). Also, there wasn't any internet in the hotel and to use the office space internet was $5 per 5 minutes if I recall correctly. The fact you can stay in a Holiday Inn and get free internet but the GW makes you pay $5 for 5 minutes is a bit ridiculous. So overall it is a great hotel (at least Napua is!). I think that kids would really enjoy it because of the pools and slides. But I do see where people feel nickel and dimed with the food costs, the chaise costs, the internet costs, and all of the little things that are so often free at much cheaper hotels. If I were staying at GW for a long stay I would definitely rent a car and eat off the hotel for most dinners. There are some FABULOUS places in Maui that are much less money and that have better ambiance. Plus, there is so much more to Maui than the GW's pools. We met a few families that literally hadn't left the resort in a whole week. And with the amazing hiking and sites to see, that is just a darn shame!!

We stayed on previous trips up in Ka'napali and Honokawai, and as Hilton Honors Diamond members, we were somewhat surprised by the lack of anything Hilton except for the GWR as a choice. But as it was the only choice for Maui if you wanted to use points, we considered it. After seeing that it was a Waldorf-Astoria collection, we decided 70K points a night was ridiculous and we started looking at various options. As we were sorting through the condos in South Maui, Hilton popped up with a 50K for 5 night special on the internet and we jumped at it with a couple of paid days added on to round out our week. But as I was suspicious of all things related to award travel, I contacted the Hotel directly and talked to the reservations manager and discussed the need to link the award with the paid and asked to assure we didn't have to move. When we arrived, we were treated to prompt and courteous valet staff, a lei greeting, and a simple and flawless check in. As the points stay did not guarantee room \"View\" we assumed the worst, but on check in the staff said they had upgraded us to full ocean view if we didn't mind the older wing. We didn't and the room itself, although aged, was clean and very quiet with a great view of Molokini and Kaho'olowe. The grounds of the Grand Wailea were meticulously kept, but some of the things we found annoying were carts running around at 6:00 AM, clanking tools on the carts, and the construction noise although minor from the building in front of us. But you couldn't fault the staff as they really tried to keep the place well maintained, despite the fact that the GWR is showing her age. But it does so gracefully. The pools were nice, but the kids/activities pools were way too crowded and busy for adults like us and the adult pool is really very boring but has nice tanning areas with uncrowded lounge chairs. Very average, but with the Wailea beach 100 yards away, who can complain? But there were downsides. One of the really annoying aspects of the pool complex is having to walk down to the activities pool to get towels and a ridiculous little plastic wrist band to show we are guests before we could just lay around at the adult pool. For a place this size, a towel area up at the adult pool wouldn't be asking too much. I understand the issues, but maybe even a gate with a room key access and an attendant would be a bit more classy? But it was nice to be able to use the pools at night and the evening swims were so relaxing a way to bring a close to the day. The Wailea beach is stunning. Not that great for snorkeling, but for just being lazy, walking at night, splashing about, etc. it was fantastic. Beautiful sand and water, and even when there are a lot of people on it, never really seems crowded. There was also excellent snorkeling was just a mile or two to the South at Polo, White Rock, Po'oulenalena, and off Secret Cove. The Makeena area was really nice as well. Going north, Keawakapu beach is spendid to be on, but not much for snorkeling. But for a view without having to go north so far as the three Kama's where obviously you get quite a lot of local crowds, it was a very nice locale. For food, Kihei had several nice local places of every food type and many small local bars. But for the resort, the coffee shop is very limited for those that just want a light continental, and the atmosphere and quality wasn't better than your local Hampton Inn's free breakfast, but unlike your local Hampton, you pay for this one. The Molokini Bistro was pretty lousy with high prices and very mediocre food. The view and atmosphere wasn't much and the whole experience was not memorable at all. However, Humu's was much better than most of the reviews had led us to believe it would be and the view, atmosphere, staff, and food were all excellent. And it helped that the hotel management gave Honors Gold and Diamond members a 40.00 credit. There were really no complaints from our one dinner there (we aren't into big dining, so we went to local places in Kihei, the old Lahaina Luau, and both the two main restaurants in the GWR. We didn't try the Sushi Restaurant. One of our main complaints was the guest free parking. The valet was efficient, but with drop and pick tips and a ridiculous 20.00 a day fee, for those like us who come and go all day, the valet wasn't an option and even if you disregard the economics related to using it, just too much of a pain. But the parking was ridiciuously difficult until night. The employees apparently can share the free parking structure, but guests can't share the employee parking. So in the day, you grab whatever you can, and many times there are NO parking places at all. This is atrocious and needs to be fixed. They had half the top level blocked off for line painting while guests had no area to park in. We fought it every day, figured out the patterns, and adjusted our activities to come in after the 7-3 shift was leaving. The walk in, with a bottle of wine, water, and other miscellaneous items assured us our caloric intake would not be an issue during our stay as you had quite a little hike from the south end of the complex up to the Molokini Wing. But in a nutshell, our complaints were limited, we definitely enjoyed the stay and would go back again. The run down wing we were in is slated to be remodeled and that will be a good thing. But the conditions were very clean, comfortable, and our maid (Lolita) was meticulous. She even ordered our shoes as between my wife and I we probably had 10-12 pairs (mostly hers) laying about. She would have them perfectly lined up, our flowers on the bed, and everything perfect each day. The tip was generous, but sometimes we felt guilty because of her attentions.

The rooms were spacious, clean (with the two notable exceptions) and had good views of the garden area, pools and ocean. The staff at check in was courteous but not as helpful and informative as one would expect. We were pointed to an elevator with assurance that our luggage would follow us. An hour later I called down to the front desk to remind them that I did in fact expect the bags to arrive sooner rather than later - which was promptly addressed. The room: The toilet in our room did not flush as the chain in the toilet tank was broken. Six hours after requesting to the front desk for the issue to be fixed I simply stuck my hands into the tank water and fiddled for three minutes to fix the problem. Two inches of water and several long strands of hair were found in the ice bucket and mold growth was evident in the grout of the shower. Neither were deeply disgusting but things that should never happen at a resort with the Waldorf Astoria label. Otherwise the room was very nice and newly renovated.

If we are paying a top price, we expect the best. We spent 7 nights (April 13-20) at the GW with 2 thirteen yr old girls, staying in adjoining Napua Tower Club rooms (We had to pay $25 per night to guarantee connecting rooms. They tried to charge us PER ROOM for this, ie $50 per night, but took it off when I complained). The girls had 2 queen beds, we had a king. These rooms are very large, well equipped, clean, with fabulous bathrooms (see my pics). We could see the ocean only from our balcony, which really didn't bother us that much as we are from Sydney and surrounded by ocean but it may matter if you are coming from somewhere else. The service in the Club areas was very good. (We noticed that guests in other rooms had to carry their own luggage, for example) Breakfast was included in the Club lounge - it finishes at 10.30am which was about 1/2 hr too early, I thought (teenagers like to sleep in!). Also they start clearing away at 10.20, which was annoying. It is not a full breakfast, but we found plenty there - fresh fruit, a wide selection of cereals, breads, one hot dish, pastries, juices. We also made use of the Club lounge every evening for cocktails and canapes (on from 5-6.30pm). Great spicy bloody marys and my DH loved his vodka martinis! Hot snacks (chicken skewers or spring rolls) were not good, but fresh veggies and dips were just fine. We made use of the excellent gym - large with the latest equipment, plenty of towels and water. The spa was superb (except the rooms were too bright for my liking) - very clean hydro baths and spa pools, really worth having at least one treatment there (we had two each, including one duo massage). The therapists were good, which is not often the case in hotel spas. The food was either average or very bad (in the Japanese restaurant). The only decent meal we had on Maui was at Spagos at the 4 Seasons next door. Huma Huma, the GW signature restaurant, was fine - nothing terrible but not really notable either. The bistro was a bistro - sandwiches, french fries, lousy burgers. I don't understand why Americans put strange orange cheese on everything, but that's another discussion! Our teenagers had a FANTASTIC time and we were SO THANKFUL for the adult pool. When one man had his 3 year old in there, we complained right away - it took a while for staff to get him out (what was worse, HE was staff on a day off!), but we kept complaining and finally he got out. The kids pool areas, with slides and rope swings, a \"river\" and hot tub is really great - for kids! Our girls loved it and were old enough to hang out there on their own - and that is the ONLY way I could survive this place. Having to be around the family pool area would have been awful for us. We were also extremely lucky, it seems..... For the first 5 days I would guesstimate that the hotel was about 1/2 full - plenty of green lawn, chairs by the ocean and adult pool, no waiting for restaurants and the gym was empty. Then, on the day before we left, a convention arrived. It was appalling and the whole character of the place changed immediately. Suddenly the elevators took much longer to arrive, we had to wait longer for our food to be served, it was harder to find pool chairs... on and on, you get the picture. This was sheer luck (though I would never go to a resort like this during high seasons like spring break, Xmas, Easter etc) and we are most thankful. Also, I really resent the $25 per day per room \"resort\" fee - what is THAT about? I knew about it, but I still don't get it. And yes, you have to pay for shade - umbrellas or cabanas. That's just another blatent rip-off. Bottom line? A great place if it's not too full and wonderful for teens. (I do not understand why honeymooners would choose a resort this size. Problem with 4 Seasons, however, is that there is no adult pool - go to Tahiti or one of the smaller isles!) Hope this, and the pics, help (it would really be helpful, I feel, if people would only post pics of rooms and bathrooms.

Things did not get off to a good start when we arrived tired and jet lagged at 12 noon off a flight from Japan and asked whether we could check in earlier than the normal 3pm time. The front desk said that they would contact housekeeping to get our room ready early and took our mobile phone number, so they could tell us when the room was ready. Two hours passed with no contact, so we went back to the front desk. They assured us that the room was being given the express treatment. Three o'clock came and went, and at around 3:15pm we were taken by a bell hop to a filthy room which hadn't been touched. The bell hop rang down to the front, who said that they had given us the wrong room. Eventually, we were placed in the right room and the bell hop fled from embarrassment without explaining any of the room's facilities and without hanging around for a tip (the one and only time at our stay in the resort). My sense from was that housekeeping had no intention of getting a room ready before 3pm and we were just fobbed off by the front desk. After unpacking, we headed down to the pool. The place was packed. Not a free chair in sight. When we turned up poolside the next day around 10am, the same situation. This is where I part company with all those four and five star reviews for this same hotel I have read. In a true luxury hotel, you do not have to fight for a pool side seat, you do not have to rush down to the pool at the crack of dawn to place your towel on a seat, you do not have to pay $100 a day to reserve a bit of shade. This is not what a luxury hotel does. This is what a mass market, mid-level or worse hotel does. Indeed, the hotel seemed intent on gouging clients at every turn. From internet access, to umbrellas on the beach, to the daily resort charge (what is this? surely when you book a room at the price of this hotel, you assume that you will be using the resort facilities). Finally, the food was truly terrible value for money. We tried the Bistro Molokini, Grand Dining Room, Cafe Kula and the Japanese restaurant Kincha. In every case you got second rate food for around two to four times the price you would pay in a good city restaurant. Everything appeared to be out a tin, instant mix or the freezer. Given everything has to be shipped into Maui, I can see the limitations. But true luxury hotels that have island locations around the world like the Four Seasons work around this - that is why you pay big bucks: so as to get good, well cooked fresh food. At the Grand Wailea you pay big bucks to get tarted-up school canteen slop. Finally, I got caught up in the airline bankrupcty problems during my stay and had to switch my flight out to Hawaiin Airlines from Aloha. Stupidly, I thought that I could use the Grand Wailea's clout to help navigate my way through all the ticketing chaos rather than waste a whole day on the phone and internet. Of course, they were not interested in helping (even up to the Day Manager level). Again the contrast with a real luxury hotel is telling: in such hotels, the senior people at the front desk have a degree of autonomy and flexiblity in problem solving for clients. At the Grand Wailea, if it is not in their rule book, they are not interested. In conclusion, for all those people who have rated this hotel highly (and for the senior management of the Grand Wailea who don't appear to get it), all I can say is try a true luxury hotel. It costs the same you know. The experience you will have at the Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons and Shangri-la is at a completely different level. Amazingly, the Waldorf Astoria has lent its brand to the Grand Wailea. I don't know what they are thinking. This is a classic way to damage a luxury brand. It fooled me into booking this hotel once, but not again! And now I will also think twice about booking any Waldorf Astoria worldwide.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palos Verdes, CA", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "TravelOpportunist", "ReviewID": "UR14817841", "Content": "For us, the key to happiness at the Grand Wailea is low expectations. Unfortunately, we checked in here after 5 lovely nights at the newly remodeled Ritz Carlton where we were pampered the entire time. Driving up we waited for 10 minutes at the valet. We then decided to just self park rather than continue to wait. We found the only open spot available in self parking and then made our way to check-in. We got in line behind 20 or so other people and just 2 check-in clerks. We noticed 6 bellmen just standing there. Why don't they cross-train the bell-people to be able to check people in when there is a lengthy delay? When we finally made it to the front of the line, the clerk immediately up-sold us to a \"garden view\" for an extra $100/night on top of the $550 we paid for the mountain view rooms which she claims look at the parking lot. Stupidly, we accepted. My brother checked in later and was automatically given a garden view just down the hall from us. It appears they are remodeling the mountain view rooms as they have stacked the beds outside on the lanai (lovely) so I suspect everyone gets upgraded automatically except those stupid enough to fall for the up-sale. The rooms are definitely in need of an upgrade. At the Ritz we had an empty fridge we could use and were regularly given free bottled water. At the GW, if you are stupid enough to drink the water they leave for you, you will be charged $6 bucks each. No free newspaper here. You have to go to the Cafe and buy one yourself. The bathroom toiletries were the worst, generic quality I have experienced in years. They even use \"creme rinse\" instead of conditioner. I didn't even think they made creme rinse anymore. At the end of the 3 days, my hair was like a brillo pad. Our room looked over the Activity pool. We were awoken at 6:30 am by people who started to stake their claim to the precious pool chairs. We quickly dressed and waited in line at the towel desk. Chairs are crammed together and you are sure to become friends with you neighbor, as your chair will be touching theirs. By 7:10am, there were essentially no chairs available unless you wanted to sit on the beach or on the grass. Cabana's are $300 and require up to a one-year advance reservation. The pool itself was fun for the 1st day but the amount of debris floating in the water made me queasy. Used Band-aids, trash, leaves, you name it, you are swimming in it. Given the Four Seasons next door is roughly the same price, we would never stay here again. I suppose if you have children and do not stay anywhere else before hand (so you have nothing to compare it to) this hotel would be satisfactory.

The trip was her high school graduation present and I had hoped that it would be very special. It was! From the moment we pulled up in our rental car, we felt pampered and fussed over. The bell captain was very helpful in explaining the check in process. We were given leis after we got out of the car and even my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuffed leopard received a lei! Check in was effortless and the bellboy was extremely helpful. He also took time to tell us everything we needed to know about our room and the hotel. Room: The room was clean and well appointed. The very best part was the lanai - at night I kept the door open so I could sleep while being soothed by the warm ocean breezes and sounds. Ahhhh! The view from the lanai was drop dead gorgeous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were even able to see whales! The lanais have a table and a couple of chairs. The beds were extremely comfortable. There is turn-down service every night, although frankly I found it annoying that they closed the lanai doors. After a couple of days, I requested that they stop the turn-down service, which was no problem. Housekeeping is impeccable. Throughout the stay, I was not bothered by noises from the other rooms. Bathroom: The bathroom was very large and spacious. There is a separate shower with a seat, which we really liked. The water pressure in the shower was not the best, but it was adequate. The tropical smelling shampoo and conditioners were great! Linens were generously sized and very luxurious. Room amenities: Real glassware is provided in the room, along with a coffee maker, tea and coffee. Mini refrigerators are available at $25 for your stay. In my opinion, the refrigerators are well worth the cost. Before we arrived at the room, we stopped at K-Mart and stocked up on sodas, wine, drinks, etc - definitely a money saver. (By the way, the bottled water by the coffee maker costs over $6 a pop.) There is a mini-bar, but we kept it locked. A safe, ironing board and iron are provided in the room. The room does have free high speed internet wireless and hooking up was easy. On the welcome screen, there are two options, one free and a fee-based upgrade for higher bandwidth. The free option was sufficient for our needs (mostly just surfing and checking e-mail) and the speed seemed comparable to my DSL service at home. Meals: I was somewhat disappointed by the Bistro Molokini \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food is above average but it is overpriced and service was only fair. We got most of our resort meals from the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kula - which had decent offerings. It was still expensive, but less pricy than the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full service restaurants. (The Belgian waffles are terrific!) The caf\u00c3\u00a9 does have an outdoor eating area with ocean views but for evening meals, we preferred to take our food upstairs to eat on the lanai. If you are willing to walk over to the Shops at Wailea (about a leisurely ten minute walk), the Whaler General Store has a deli which is much more affordable if you just want something light. If you are staying at the Grand, you must try the Grotto bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is actually in the pool under a waterfall! You are supposed to be 21 and over to sit at the bar, but the bartender was kind enough to let my daughter sit at the bar for a bit when it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t busy. Can life get any better than to be under a waterfall drinking a frou-frou drink while sitting IN the pool?! Grounds: The grounds are beautiful and well kept. As you pull in the main drive, there is a gorgeous waterfall on the right. There are pools throughout the resort with lots of koi and even some turtles. The pool by the Humuhumu has a lot of colorful tropical fish. Artwork and flowers abound throughout the property. Pool/beach: Of course, the Grand has a great pool with lots of fun stuff, but we spent most of our time on the beach. The beach is very clean as is the ocean floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will not need sandals in the water. Even wading out a bit, you can still see the ocean floor. There are plenty of beach chairs (you have to pay for the blue and white cabana chairs). Because this is the leeward side of the island, the waves are generally mild \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the place for surfing. Boogie boards, kayaks, etc are available for rent in a shore-side kiosk and can be charged to your room. My daughter did rent a boogie board ($20 for 24 hours) and was able to ride a few waves. (If you want to boogie board a lot, I would suggest buying one on the island rather than renting on a daily basis. We saw some for about $20 at Hilo Hatties.) There is a shower for cleaning your feet by the beach. Even though it was spring break, I did not find the beach to be overly crowded. Miscellaneous stuff: The resort does have valet parking for $20 a day or free parking. The free parking spaces are small and all seem to be next to a concrete pillar. Maneuvering in and out of the spaces is difficult. There are no laundry facilities for the guests and the resort charges for laundry by the piece. The business center has computers with internet access for a fee. However, printing boarding passes is free. (When we left from OGG, there was a LONG line for people checking in without boarding passes and no line for those with boarding passes. So, it is definitely worth while to print your boarding passes before leaving the resort.) We only stopped by the concierge once (the desk is well staffed) and he was very helpful. Overall, resort staff was friendly and ready with a smile. If you plan to stay on the grounds after checking out (noon), we were told that there is a courtesy room to keep your stuff until you leave and that you can still use the resort facilities. The check out process is simple and a mistake on my bill was promptly handled. Should you spend all of your time at the resort?: You could very easily \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the answer is no! Maui has a lot to offer and if you are staying a week, there is simply not enough time. Activities we enjoyed included kayaking, snorkeling, seeing the sunrise on Haleakala, hiking, horseback riding (Pi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122iholo and Lahaina ranches), a whale watching boat ride (awesome!), spending time in Lahaina and Pa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ia and visiting Ho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122okipa Beach to watch the surfers.

Sadly, the reality is that the hotel has a low-class, concession stand feel about it, where after spending $3000 for two rooms for two nights, we were nickeled and dimed at every turn. Every person at the pool is required to wear a wristband, even the adults; If your child wants an inner tube, you have to purchase one - as a result, hundreds of unused and abandoned inner tubes litter the property. If you need a snorkel mask, no problem, for $30 a day they will rent you one. (Snorkel Bob's rented us a brand new prescription mask for $10 a day). If you expect to sit, you better be willing to pay. Cabanas are $250; Casabellas $150 and teak lawn chairs $75, according to the extension you were directed to call in the hotel information booklet. This is in additon to the $25.00 per day per room resort fee. The first day we arrived early (10 a.m.), but not early enough and could find no chairs anywhere by the pool area to lay down our items, much less sit. The next day we arose early, had breakfast and went to sit in the pool area. There we found restrictive signs all over the place asking you to pay for cabanas, casabellas, etc. but then we found a little grassy area between the pool and the beach where chairs were scattered haphazardly and no signs. My husband arranged some chairs in order and we sat down. Three hours later, we were told by hotel staff that we would have to pay $150 for the chairs, or move down to the beach. Since our 12 year old daughter was in the pool, and since there had been no sign telling us we could not sit in this area, we refused to move, but were embarrassed and offended at the suggestion that we had done something wrong, when in fact we had made every effort to find a spot not restricted by signs (there are a lot of signs prohibiting you from sitting down!!). I complained to the front desk and sometime later was approached again by the same employee who, by way of obstensible apology, said that we could stay there today, but would have to pay tomorrow. Again, embarrassed in front of our children by the suggestion that we had done something wrong, I informed the employee not to worry, that we were checking out the next day, never to return. I then requested a meeting with management, and was met by the Assistant Director of Food and Beverage for the Pool, who claimed to be the highest ranking management on site at the hotel. (It was a Sunday). In response to my inquiry whether, after spending $3000 for two days it was reasonable for me to expect at least one chair for our party of six, the manager said, no, It was unreasonable: that the hotel couldn't possibly provide chairs for all the guests who wanted them; that, in fact, the hotel did not want to charge for chairs, but was \"forced to\" in order to accomodate the wishes and demands of those guests who \"really wanted\" chairs.The next day, an operating manager called my husband, a Hilton Gold VIP member, and told him that the reason there were no signs where we sat down was because he had already spent $10,000 this year in signage and there was no more money in the budget for signs. I respectifully suggest that the money would have been better spent finding a place for his guests to sit. Ultimately, we were given a $200 credit upon checkout for our complaint (too little too late), and I was upset enough to cancel our dinner reservation at the fine dining restaurant (on the theory that I was not spending one more dime at the hotel, much less $600+ for our party of six). But, in the end, It is clear that whoever classified the Grand Wailea as part of the Waldorf Astoria collection has never stayed at either hotel. I have stayed at the Waldorf many times and was treated there with the respect I expected, but did not receive at the Grand Wailea. I am not sure what part of the experience is supposed to be first class, except for the fees you are charged. My suggestion is that you stay at the Mauna Lani on the Big Island, where you are treated from the moment you arrive as a first class guest at a first class resort. Chairs, internet, newspapers and pool use are free; guests are offered free popsicles and smoothie samples daily; towels are graciously provided without having to provide paperwork; no resort fee, various activities are offered daily for free.

There is always cold water or juice in the lobby and at the pools so you do not always have to keep buying $12 frozen drinks. The rooms were very big and the views spectactular. The Wailea are is a great part of the island, shops are close by for groceries and typical shopping etc.... Beach was great as well.

We have been there in January and February and never had rain, and only a few clouds. Never a bad stay. If there is a downside, it is the convention trade.

Fortunately, my experience was the opposite of all those negative reviews! We booked 6 nights for 300,000 HHonors points, and paid $500/night for two additional nights. I expected no upgrade, but we were upgraded to Napua Tower; I expected no HHonors \"perks\" but was immediately recognized as a Diamond member, given $25 certificate for use at Molokini Bistro, and 20% discount certificate for the spa - as well, as a welcoming letter from the manager (which said, by the way \"If you're Diamond or Gold, and we haven't been able to give you a free upgrade, you will be given other options and additional HHonors points.\" I expected moldy carpets and furniture, peeling wallpaper, and dirty tile grout in the bathroom, but got a beautifully furnished, exceptionally maintained, spacious ocean-view room - my wife was especially happy that we could sit on the lanai and see Molokini, and watch whales. I expected to be charged extra for taking a deep breath, but, really found nothing out of line with any other top-line resort. Yeah, $18 for a burger is on the high side, but, look where you get to eat it! Maybe it was just the time of our visit, but, while we saw lots of kids, they certainly were neither pervasive, nor pests. We loved the idea that there was an adult pool - with lounges available as late as 9:30 in the morning (we were never unable to find a pair near the pool) and kids were over in there's doing whatever they wanted to do. Seems Hibiscus was heated, and activity pools were not, but they were certainly not uncomfortable - and at least as warm as the ocean! The staff was friendly and helpful, the facility was beautiful and comfortable. Loved the Hospitality Suite for shower and changing clothes on last day - we checked out of our room at 2:00 PM and stayed by the pool until 5:00 PM - and easily caught our 9:40 PM flight home. And, for those who think Wailea is too haughty, I believe you've got it wrong.

I am staying at the resort right now and can honestly say that this is one of the best (if not the best) Hilton resorts worldwide. I will give you that the prices are high. This is Maui, not Las Vegas-no $0.99 cent lobster buffets here. If you are expecting that, do not come here. Really. However, I can say that the hotel is maintained to the best standards. We moved from a garden view room to the Napuia Tower. The garden view was great. We actually had more room than in the \"exculsive\" tower. However, the walks to and from the pool were less in the tower, and this was better for my husband, who had just had hip replacement surgery. The service was first class and with a smile. We had dinner at the Four Seasons. \"The Ultimate Romantic Dinner\". Very expensive, but it was our 10th anniversary.. What we experienced was below standard for a Four Seasons. THIS IS IMPORTANT... While the view was incredible, patrons staying at the Four Seasons are stacked on top of each other. They simply do not have the room that the Grand Wailea does. So here I am, having this romantic dinner and had to listen to two male guests talk about the size of a (---). I stood up and made them aware of our presence, and they finally moved off, but it made more than a negative impression. Also, I had a meeting with the chef. While he did a great job, they forgot that I wanted a specific selection of wines and I paid an extra $150 for our wedding cake to be duplicated and IT WASN'T. They didn't duplicate it. I was really surprised and disappointed by that given that I had several conversations with the booking person and the pastry chef. So if you really must stay at the Four Seasons, Its really more about marketing than a better experience. (Think Lexus vs Toyota). The lobby and grounds are clearly nicer at the Grand Wailea. Its more about being a snob than about a better experience. Get yourself a bottle of spay Evian if you must, but stay at the Grand Wailea. You will have more room and a more grand experience. Oh-almost forgot-you get a better sunset view at HumaHuma vs Duo. Regarding maintenance, again, I can say it was first class. I have seen maintenance people routinely shining the brass. Unlike other reviews, when we had an issue with our room, if was fixed immediately. We encountered no weird smells and no issues that detracted from our stay. If you have an issue, I would speak up. I felt that they were attentive to any issue or concern that was valid. I have personally stayed at most Hilton resorts around the world. I would say this is by far the best. We went to the Maui Prince for a snorkel trip, and found that to be way below any standard. More like a Howard Johnson's. The Grand Wailea is really a First Class Resort.

The lobby is breathtaking and made us stop and stare. Having left a freezing Providence 12 hours earlier, this was quite a contrast. Our room was on the ground floor of the Lagoon wing, with a garden view. It was somewhat disappointing not to be able to see the ocean, but an ocean view was just a 100 foot walk away. We would describe the room as clean, but probably due for a makeover. The sofa in our room, as well as the armoire and TV were showing definite signs of wear and tear. We may have watched the TV for an hour our whole stay, so it wasn't a big deal at all. The bathroom was very clean and modern, no issues there. The king bed was really, really comfortable.....in my opinion, the most comfortable in the country!! There were a few fruitflies in the room, but in a hotel with no doors, and access to the beautiful outdoors with a large sliding door, what do people expect. Housekeeping should be commended, for keeping such a large property so clean and inviting. This was a real pleasant surprise based on some of the other reviews. We did not utilize the Spa, but we did utilize the Gym. It is a very nice workout facility versus what you get at other hotels. Lot of weight training equipment, as well as free weights, a real nice feature. As stated earlier, the prices here are WAY out of line.....but it is to be expected. We had rented a Jeep, and were able to go off property and found prices much more reasonable....however, we incurred the cost of a rental car for the week. Six of one a half dozen of the other. The self parking was very easy, and not that far away, and we weren't pressured or intimidated into using the valet service. There was not one rude or unwilling or unfriendly employee that we encountered. They were all friendly and more than willing to be of help or service. The pools and beach are beautiful. The adult pool was only populated by adults. The activity pool was busy, but not too overly crowded. It is funny however, to see nobody at the pool at 7am, but yet, so many chairs \"reserved\" with towels. There wasn't much of a problem finding chairs during the day though. The water elevator is interesting, for 1 ride, but overrated in our opinion. Overall, this is a great place to stay if you don't mind that feeling of staying in a large resort. You probably would not like it if you were looking for something a little more intimate. BTW, do not miss seeing the summit of Haleakala, or Oheo Gulch on the backside of the National Park. The natural beauty can not be duplicated anywhere else in the World.

Rooms - We had 2 adjacent rooms and had absolutely no complaints - roomy, clean, great views. Pool area - pools are the best I have seen anywhere in the world for kids and if you go there with no kids there is a completely separate, large pool section for adults. Also the areas are very well maintained. It was very crowded but kept clean as reasonably possible. Service for drinks and food was fine each day considering the crowd. There was the early rush to get towels (which they had enough of), and the best seating, but no large family oriented hotel anywhere has solved that problem. Beach - nice and large, by Maui standards, lots of activities for all. Crowd - light on from the east coast so attitudes were few and far between, some major celebs, many many kids, overall pleasant. Restaurants - only had breakfast (good) at the hotel on some days since there are over 300 eating establishments in Maui to try and we like to get out. Spa - none better. General cost - this is an expensive establishment and that includes everything. Some prices are way over the top and if you go there expecting average to high prices you will be disappointed. High and very high is what you will get so bargain hunters beware. (You can mitigate some costs simply by shopping for drinks/snacks/booze at the local market.)

I stayed here with my husband and two kids (12&10) in an ocean view with 2 double beds from 12/27-1/1/08. It was very roomy but we had a big ant problem. (We had stayed on the west side of the island at Kaanapali beach and had no bug problem for 7 days). We had them come spray our first night and again the next morning. When we got back from the pool all day the ants were back. We talked to the front desk when leaving for dinner and he offered another room to us. He stated 4 other ppl had complained about ants that day. He gave us 3 keys for the room so we would not have to stop back at the front desk. Once we inspected the new room he said we could just transfer our stuff to the new room and let the front desk know we were switching. We thought that was nice of him since the walk to the front desk from our room(s) was about 10 minutes. It took us an hour to pack up our stuff and move. We let the front desk know when we called for a bellhop. Our new room was outdated with old tile and decoration but was the same size. It was more noisy however since the staff rolled carts down the hall all night. Unfortunately we did not know this until we were trying to sleep! The next day we went on a snorkeling trip from 7-2:30. Upon returning to our room our key did not work. My husband had to trek back to the lobby where they said our rooms were never switched. My husband received a call from the manager soon after getting in the room . He waived our $25 resort fee for the two days we had problems and sent an amenities basket (very nice) 2 days later. I also surprised my husband with some birthday balloons and a cake delivered to our room on the 30th and it was great (FYI-$75 cost). The room service man was spectacular. Now on to the pool area. This was just awful. I will never stay at this resort again mainly for this fact. By 7:05 I would say all the chairs by the pool were reserved. They don't let you on the pool deck until 7! They have too many cabanas that rent out for $300 a day that have 4 chairs under the canopy plus it reserves the 4 chairs in front of it. Supposedly they have a worker that goes around and watches if no one comes to the reg. chairs after 1 1/2 hours he removes your items and the chairs open up for new ppl. Our first day I saw a zillion chairs never used until the afternoon and he never moved a thing! Another day we were going to brunch at a nearby hotel so we greased this pool worker $20 to keep our chairs just because we didn't want to lose them. There is a nice grassy area between the pool/walkway and beach with chairs that you have to RENT and RESERVE ahead of time. It was just ludicrus. We saw tons of ppl turned away because there were no chairs anywhere. Another day we had a reserved chair taken by another family who admitted to it upon our arrival . They offered it back but we declined since our kids were elsewhere at the time. Our 3rd chair we gave to a young couple with a 9 month old who I noticed had circled the pool 3x looking for 1 open chair. They have gone here for years and say the ppl just get ruder every year and we saw that this year as well! The walk to the pool was about 15 min. from our room. The layout of the property is just silly-you have to back track from your room to get the few elevators that take you down to the first level to head to the pool. They roll towel carts along the pool area all day long. You would think at an upscale hotel they would have a private walkway for that away from the ppl relaxing by the pool. It was obnoxious. The beach was back to back ppl and my kids could not even throw a nerf ball around-this was of course was not the hotels fault. The walkway north was nice but ppl are extremely rude (especially joggers) and won't even walk single file when passing others. Common sense is very lacking. I also did not like the Head Valet man because he was snooty and condescending to me when I asked about the shuttle service to shopping but EXTREMELY nice to a woman after me. The other valet ppl were very nice and quick . The concierge were nice too. Overall, the room size was the only good thing about the property besides the service but that was not exceptional. For dining, Longhis was scrumptious while I would really skip Cheeseburgers, Mai Tais and Rock and Roll in the Shops of Wailea. The service was horrible along with the burgers. We were told while shopping on a rainy News Years Eve that it always rains this day of the year so I would suggest leaving that day or 1/2 because 1/1 was absolutely gorgeous and it was tough to leave then!

A colleague recommended it to us and their website makes it look truly \"grand\" but in person you could tell it was rundown as soon as you set foot on the property. I just read in a review on Trip Advisor that they are going to renovate in Feb 08 and boy does this place need it. Everything was moldy, banged up and run down. The room smelled, the deck was dirty (and also gave no privacy - it was tiny and you looked right at all the decks of the suites next to you). The pool which looks so good online was old with dirty tiles and the waterslide which looks like a great volcano ride is nothing. This I think is the most expensive hotel in Wailea and also the worst. Hopefully the reno changes things. While we were there however we checked out all the other hotels in the Wailea area for our next trip. We got staff at each hotel to show us the rooms and grounds. We checked out Kaanapali too which is really great but we like Wailea because it's newer, the hotel grounds more spacious, and Wailea is closest to our favourite beaches - Makena's Big Beach which is great for body surfing and Turtle Town where we swam with a 300 pound turtle! Both are 5 minutes away. The Sheraton at Kaanapali has great grounds with a fun pool and great beach and is right on Black Rock, but is not as private as the resorts in Wailea. The Marriott and Hyatt at Kaanapali are also great but there is no beach there. In Wailea our favorites are as follows: Fairmont - starts at $525 a night (vs Grand Wailea $725) and is completely renovated with beautiful pool with 140 foot waterslide, separate adult pool, all white architecture which gives it a Mediterranean feel, on site shops, fitness room, a virtually private beach (Polo Beach). The Marriott, Four Seasons and Grand Wailea all share Wailea Beach. The rooms at the Fairmont are beautiful with a separate bedroom, beautiful private deck. This is where we'll be staying next trip. Four Seasons - Gorgeous; pool is not quite as nice for kids but otherwise a fantastic looking hotel. Has tennis courts onsite too. Only problem is that they have a 200 person waitlist if you want to book over Xmas. Marriott. Also first class; my only complaint was that the suites have all tile floors and although the floor plan of the suites is very similar to the Fairmont there is no separate bedroom, just a big L shaped room so there is not any privacy if your kids are sleeping on the pull out sofa. Marriott also has a beautiful Luau (Fairmont, Grand Wailea, Four Seasons do not). I didn't want to go and do the tourist thing, but we went for the kids and it was wonderful. A delicious meal, open bar, and the show told a story of the history of Hawaii complete with Fire man, hula dancers, and a gymnast who climbed a rope 50 ft in the air and did acrobatics (representing the goddess of the mist). Luau was $264 for a family of four and worth it. We'd have been happy with Fairmont, Four Seasons, Marriott. Didn't get a chance to check out the Renaissance though. If you're looking for a condo the Ekahi Village in Wailea has wonderful grounds and is on a beach (Keawapuku?) but people told us each condo is different - some great, some rundown.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cA lot of fun but noisy!\u201d", "Author": "RealEstateDiva", "ReviewID": "UR12176126", "Content": "Overall we had a wonderful time during both our visits.

May we recommend Duo or Nicks instead - these are well worth a $300 dinner. 2. No rooms ready for over 2 hours after check in time, and no luggage access during this period. It was uncomfortably hot \"in limbo\" as there are no air conditioned lounges to wait in in travel clothes. 3. There were VERY LOUD corporate parties going on outdoors in the open space near the chapel almost nightly. It was terrible and not very relaxing to lie in bed and listen to booming disco/rock bands at 10p at night in peaceful hawaii, especially when you're exhausted from the sun and pools and your kids are trying to sleep. 4. Pillows are awful! The worst nights sleep we've ever had in a hotel and we travel a lot! My husband drove all the way to Kahalui (over an hour there and back) the next day and purchased pillows. We visit Hawaii often & I must say with all it's grandeur, pools, and amenities the two things the GW lack are a solid sense of relaxation, and a true hawaiian spirit so prominent in other hotels nearby. ie... the bar at the pool plays rock and roll all day (like in vegas) and not hawaiian music.

Good luck finding a parking spot there. It was disappointing. Overall, we would not return as a couple. It wasn't special enough for us to match the price tag (sorry).

Even though I got there early I wasn't quick enough and ended up in the back row between the garbage cans and the bathrooms. I am not kidding when I say that by 7:15 all the chairs were gone.(the waterslide opens at 10:00). Don't even think about shade because there isn't any outside of the $275.00 cabanas (which were totally booked all week) or a few palapas which somehow didn't block any sun at all. They offer no umbrellas, only blazing sun all day...There really is no shade anywhere. That will, of course, only be a problem if you are lucky enough to actually get a lounge chair. There didn't seem to be enough chairs for the number of guests needing them. The lounge chairs were pretty dirty too. I had to clean the bird droppings off myself. The rooms were adequate enough and at least free from visible mold. We did smell it though. The sticky remote control and spotty bathroom handles prompted me to buy a can of Lysol to give the rooms a good disinfection. We paid over $750.00 for each of our two rooms plus they had the nerve to add $25.00 a night connecting charge. That would be to open the doors between the rooms. There also is a $25.00 per room \"Resort Fee\" each day to use the resort that you are paying to stay at. Go figure. Our supposed internet connection (part of the resort fee) didn't work so I was forced to use the business center at $3.50 for each 5 minutes on the computer.

You need to do it once, then you probably never want to go back again. Maybe when I actually have kids and they renovate - I would reconsider! Pool - This Las Vegas sized hotel has the best pool in the country! Your kids will love you as they navigate through the lazy river, water elevator, rope swing & waterslides. All the kids were having a blast - heck, we were having a blast! They spent a TON of money landscaping the lagoon, on art work and into the waterpark area. Go to the gallery to see the Warhols & Picassos! The monstrosity of the hotel does make it tough to get around quickly though. Chairs are a pain to find near the waterpark, but easy around the adult pool. Business Centre - $3.75 for 5 minutes!!! Say goodbye to checking email...that's expensive! Food - I dug Cafe Kula. Breakfast was only around $15 with decent selection. You could also do 'cheaper' dinners like pizza, salads, spaghetti here. It wasn't AMAZING food, but it was decent. Overpriced, of course - but cheaper then the restaurants. The Bistro is a nice middle option and the poolside menu ain't bad either. Burgers were $15 or so, frozen drinks - $12 (and they were small!), virgin drinks were $8 (ouch!), $6 Shave Ice or Ice Cream. Kids were charging this stuff to their rooms like crazy!!! If you can, eat off the resort @ Cheeseburgers in Paradise or Tommy Bahama Cafe. The food is justified by the prices over at The Shops @ Wailea. Better idea - hit the Safeway up the highway and stock up on bagels, cream cheese, orange juice etc. Room - Same thoughts as others...rundown, smelly, dated and in need of a renovation. We had a 'parking lot' view over a really LOUD air conditioning unit. It was fine with the window closed, but we didn't really use our lanai because of it. The bed was comfy...but is this really a 'Waldorf Astoria' quality room? Spa - $170 plus tip for my 50 minute massage. The star here is the 'Water Spa' area with it's different baths. Never seen anything like it before - loved it and felt relaxed. Would probably not do it again, it was more like a one-time treat & I'm sure the novelty would wear off.

We had visited the hotel three years prior in 2004 as guests but didn't stay there over night - we went to their spa, met friends, went in the pool etc. So this time when we returned to the island, we wanted to try a stay at the famed resort. Overview: The Grand Wailea is very nicely situated in Wailea, Maui. The rooms were a decent size, the amenities at the hotel were plentiful, and the beach is very nice in this area too and right outside the hotel grounds. However, when considering a top tier hotel these items would seem standard features. There were things about the Wailea that were just shy of fabulous - and for the money it costs to visit the Wailea and the reputation of the property - I would certainly say it has lost it's shine in recent years. The lobby is dramatic and impressive but there are areas when the hotel is not in the four or five star category. It is such a thin line that takes a property from \"WOW, it was fabulous\" to \"yeah, it was nice\" - much of it is in the detail of the finish and the level of service, both these areas fell short in our expectations. The Rooms: As I mentioned above, the rooms are of a decent size. We stayed in room 5083 which had it's own patio and lawn area on the 5th floor with a partial ocean view. The bed was comfortable and the linens were very nice - high thread count and all feather pillows and mattress topper. Two arm chairs, ottoman and a desk occupied space in the room - so it was quite spacious. However, the bathroom was mediocre - plain white ceramic tile, simple separate shower, granite slab tops on the vanity unit - but was without a doubt showing it's age. Cracks in the floor tile & and didn't have the WOW factor that I've seen in other \"luxury\" resorts like the Bellagio, Wynn and Swiss Hotel chains. The bathroom was, in short tired. There was also a really large armoire in the room that housed a large old-fashioned 32\" TV. Now, I certainly didn't spend time in the room watching TV - but it was another example of the hotel's age by not having flat screens in the rooms and still using older worn furniture in the space. The door coming into the room was grubby looking; the hallways weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always swept and clean. Regularly we would walk past dirty room service dishes that were left in the hallways, sometimes more than a day. The manicured property look was only evident in the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and on occasion the lobby bar was a wreck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dirty glasses, plates, old magazines left lying around. The Pools: This is the one area of the resort I think people will love, particularly those visiting with children. The resort has a wonderful labyrinth of pools for the kids to play in, including water slides, water elevator, rope swing, bridges to cross etc. During our stay it was clear to see that the family traveler was provided with many ways to entertain their whole group - other hotels in the area of similar stature (Four Seasons and the Fairmont) didn't have the \"Disneyland\" appeal the Wailea has for many kids. The hibiscus pool for adults was lovely, quieter and more relaxing than the kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools and nice to use for a dip to relieve the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat after lying on the loungers during the day. The Spa: I've been to the Wailea Spa a couple of times and it truly is a wonderful place. For the price of the treatments, given that many of the other resorts are in the same price category, you get more pampering for you dollar as they have so many facilities that are included in the treatment price. They have a whole host of baths for you to sample prior to your treatment, enzyme baths, mineral baths, Roman tubs, Japanese bath/shower and you also get a scrub included before your massage to rid you of dead skin means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll retain your tan for longer too! :-) It was pretty crowded when I was there and that's the only downside. It's extremely popular. So you would have to wait to use some of the baths as they were always occupied, it did feel a little rushed and I don't like that the staff only provided you with a towel until you've had your scrub and are ready to go to your massage appointment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually about an hour after you first arrive. It also takes the shine off the bathing options when you can see how many people have been lounging around in the same bath water before you. Tina was my massage therapist and was very good at her craft and the treatment was relaxing and good at removing the air travel kinks I'd received earlier that day. So, overall - it's a good experience and I think 9 out of 10 people will really enjoy their visit. Food & Beverage: This property is not renowned for it's F&B services - some of the restaurants are great for lunch and Kincha the Japanese restaurant had decent sushi, the atmosphere at the facility was so-so. The bistro for lunch was nice and we had decent food there and the service from our waitress Lori - whose section we requested after our first visit - was terrific. Sashimi Ahi was really nice and fresh, as was their grilled Mahi Mahi. Room service was very well presented, breakfast in the room served on your lanai is a nice experience and the quality of the food was again decent. However, there is a 21% gratuity included in the room service and a $4 delivery charge. And - you also pay a $25 per day resort fee, which doesn't include valet parking (an additional $15 per day), all room service gratuities. We were also charged a service fee when they had to restock the mini bar - this seemed excessive. The can of Heineken from the mini bar ended up costing $8.50 including the service fee to place another replacement beer in the fridge. The pool side wait service is similar in it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricing - and again - with everything else you pay for at this hotel, I think the management there should address where it can afford not to gouge their customers with simply outlandish charges. A small Fiji water 330ml (yes I'm sure it was that size bottle), was $7.50 - that didn't include any service fee or gratuity, just how much was being charged for the product. That type of mark-up just seems to take advantage of the customer and is unnecessary. The Check-out Bill: This area was a little worrying and follows on from the final comments in the F&B section. There's a difference in a resort like the Wailea being expensive, everyone knows that when he or she makes a reservation here and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, Maui is an expensive place to go for vacation. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difference in this baseline knowledge and when the resort takes advantage of customers in completely outlandish pricing and adding charges to the bill without the knowledge of the guest. Upon check out we reviewed the bill - we'd put lots of charges on the room so wanted to see exactly what we'd spent. We had been charged for four extra days of valet parking we never used and some mini bar inaccuracies. Who reported that charge to the bill? How did they determine that cost was to go to our account? Do they just put it on every bill automatically and don't tell you about it? They did remove the charge - but there wasn't an apology and no explanation of how it got there. The total of incorrect charges on our check out bill came to $72. We spent a total of $1,700 at the resort while we were there, yet they still were trying to get the extra $72 - it seemed the hotel was always trying to get a little bit more out of it's guests, even when everyone there seemed willing to use and pay for services at the resort. Service: The way the bill was handled goes someway to demonstrate the level of service at the hotel too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c kind of a not too bothered, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care attitude; this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true in every case, but more times than not I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sad to say it was. We visited the Fairmont while we were staying at the Wailea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their lobby bar is great at sunset so we strolled over there and ended up going back four times! This is the comparison I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m using against the Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service. Everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bar none \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the Fairmont was delightful. The greeting coming into the property, the bar staff, spa attendant, spa therapists who we met, Nick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish market servers and hostess were fabulous. After we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d finished our drinks at the lobby we went to the bell desk and asked for a cab back to the Wailea. The girl at the desk was lovely taking my name, asking how we enjoyed our visit to their hotel, how long we were staying, etc, etc. Then the Cadilac arrived. The Fairmont provided complimentary car service from their hotel to ours, or from their hotel to the Wailea shops, or to a local restaurant if you wanted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all at NO FEE. Just part of their service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and THAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S the difference between a nice hotel and a WOW hotel. Because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already paying for a great hotel that should come with great perks that shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost you extra money, it should be included at that level of resort. The Fairmont even sent the car to pick me up from the Wailea when I returned to visit their spa the next day \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh just call me and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll send the car over to get you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fabulous\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..

There are pros and cons to this hotel and I hope I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown where each can be found. But the truth is in its price category, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better experience and level of service available; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be going to the Fairmont.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cNot what it used to be\u201d", "Author": "laplume9254", "ReviewID": "UR10785645", "Content": "For years, the Grand Wailea resort has been one of our favorite vacation hotels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6in fact, we stayed at the property on average two times a year.

Paint chipped, dirty walls, doors with dirty fingerprints, and filthy light fixtures were very apparent. Our room was not much better with spotted upholstery and chipped furniture. Our 4th floor grassy area was appalling. There was a paper cup lid, a straw wrapper, a dirty band-aid, cigarette butts, and weeds about six inches high.

She was very apologetic, and upgraded one of our guests to the concierge level, along with the promise that our other guests would have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The next day we spoke with manager Shannon Schiling about the condition of our patio, and he assured us that the patio garbage would be taken care of. During our five day stay, the patio was never rid of the garbage. Not just our hallway was disgusting, but the hallways of our guests were also never swept. They, too, had chipped paint with dirty walls and doors. Our dealings with the concierge, Richard, were not much better. He assured us that he cancelled our return Speedy Shuttle reservation at our request. This cancellation was never done, and Speedy Shuttle came to the hotel resulting in a needless charge to us. As I stated before, I am so disappointed in the condition of the property. I cannot imagine paying $900 over the Christmas Holiday for a room in such poor condition. This trip was embarrassing to us as we were the hosts to very important business clients. I look forward to the time when this resort is renovated, updated, and cleaned up to its previous condition.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cFreaking Awesome\u201d", "Author": "Pete495", "ReviewID": "UR10782496", "Content": "This Resort was totally Posh! I cannot understand the negative reviews. Yes, the restaurants are expensive. Yes, they do charge a lot of money. Have you people looked around though? Everything on Maui is expensive, especially the hotels. Every hotel charges about double for drinks. If you go to a restaurant and bar off hotel premises, you will find it a lot cheaper. It is not just the Grand Weilea that charges extra for everything. We stayed at two Hotels on our stay, one which was less stars than the other, and both were comparable when it came to restaurant food and drink. My wife and I are middle class, and we stayed at this resort for 5 days. When we got to the resort, we checked ourselves in and parked our own car to save a little money. We parked our own car everyday, because they charge you money per day to use valet. When we were checked in, we were given a choice for an upgrade, either a king bed or two queens with an ocean view. We chose the ocean view, and what a spectacular view it was. Very Nice! We were very Pleased! The Parking lot is further away if you park yourself, but it was worth a few dollars saved. All resorts charge extra for their daily resort fee, and this is extra in addition to your trip fee, whether it is expedia, unitedvacations, or whatever, so expect it when you go. The Service: Excellent As said above, all you had to do was ask, and you were accomodated. We did not like the puffy pillows in the rooms, so we asked for flatter pillows in our room from housekeeping, and were immediately accomodated. On the beach, staff would help you grab chairs, give you as many towels as you wanted, and it was not too much trouble to ask for anything. Water was free all over the premises. they had tanks w/ cups everywhere. Everyone said hello, or Aloha, or Mahalo. The Room: We were upgraded to Oceanview with two Queens. The view was amazing, and the bathroom came with a two person soaking tub, and a glass enclosed shower, which could easily fit 3 persons if you wanted. Mini bar and frig accompanied the room, and it was very tempting not to use the mini bar, but it was just too expensive. We went to the Weilea village, and were able to buy liqour and beer for less than half the price of the mini bar contents. One should expect the mini bar to be high priced though. There are complimentary robes in the room. the beds are simply plushible comfortability. The Lanai comes with two chairs and a table. The room comes with free internet via internet cable provided. Housekeeping comes twice a day, once in the morning to clean, and once in the evening to provide turn down service. I suggest leaving a couple dollars tip at least, and they will treat you right. Bell men insisted upon helping with the luggage, which we felt was very nice even though we were pretty much doing it ourselves anyway. They also have the Napua Tower, which has its own wing with it's own continental breakfast, and its own Hour d oevers and wine nightly, and also its own concierge. obviously we did not stay here, but passed by it on the way to our room everyday, and wondered about its amenities. it is available for extra dollars of course. The Service: Above Par: Now if you rent one of the cabanas for a cost on the lawn, you will have someone to wait on you and they will bring you frozen grapes all day, but we did not spend the money on the cabana. If you ask the waiter or waitresses for drinks while you are sitting in chairs though, they will gladly accomodate. We did not order too many drinks though because they are really expensive, which we knew going in (12 dollars/mixed drink). If you didn't know this going in, I guess I could see how you could react poorly, but when you go to a resort this size, you should really do a little research. We used chairs on the beach at no cost. Really, the cabanas were not worth the money unless you have a medical condition that prevents you from being in the sun. The Spa: All we heard about when we were at the Resort was how great the Spa was. We did not use it, but apprently it is rated one of the best around. We thought about it several times, but did not want to spend the extra money since we were spending so much already. Beach and Pools: Beach is rated best in the nation many times. I have even seen it on the Travel Channel at Home. Snorkel excursions visit nearby because of all the turtles, and because of it being such a great snorkel site. The beach is pretty much immaculate, with lawn and laying chairs available, nice white sand and fairly calm waters. The pool is in itself just freaking amazing. There are a bunch of pools on a slope, and all are connected by several waterslides, two big ones being the main attractions. Between the two big waterslides is the worlds only water elevator, which takes you to the top of one of the big waterslides. We understood what we paid when we saw and rode in the water elevator. There is an adult habiscus pool which is luke warm rather than the cold water pools near the bottom. There are two adult hot tubs near the adult hibiscus pool, and there is also a massage therapist near the hibiscus pool which is avaiable for a charge. there are probably a total of 5-7 hot tubs, and also several pools. there is a kiddy beach for the kids right off of the regular beach, which is made to be safer, and is really a pool/beach for the children. There are lifeguards all around. The Land: They have about 15 million dollars put into their art work. They have tours of the resort for free just to view their art work if you like that sort of thing. They also have tours for the Flowers and landscape where they explain all that to you if you like that sort of thing also. Eating: We ate and drank very rarely at the hotels we stayed at because it was so expensive. The other hotel we stayed at was the Sheraton. It was also very very nice, and we would go back to either hotel, but the drinking and eating at both places was expensive, so we planned ahead wear to eat and drink by using Maui books bought in different stores. We sprang a little and ate breakfast once at the Grand Weilea in the Grand Dining Room the last morning we were there. My wife is a big breakfast fan, so we tried it. It was $28 pp, and even though it was a huge breakfast, and it included a lot of food, it still was not worth the dollars. That is why we planned ahead to eat off of the resorts. Other: Most people we talked to did not leave the resort, but we knew better. We did the Road to Hana, The Pipwai trail, another hike walk, and viewed many of the beaches North of Kannapali. We also did a Trilogy excurion for our Snorkel trip, and it took us to Molokini, where the water was clear about 50 feet down. We both agreed we had never seen water as clear before, and we have both snorkeled a couple of times before. Trilogy was awesome, fed us breakfast and lunch, and snacks in between, and was always asking us if we needed more to drink. I highly recommend Trilogy! You will need a car on the island if you are going off the resort. It is a negative if you do not get out of your hotel room. If you are not squeemish in the Car, do the Road to Hana, and go to the 7 Sacred Pools, and walk the Pipiwai trail (2 miles one way) Follow the pics and paragraphs in Maui Revealed. It was definitely our little blue book on this trip. Overall: If you go to Maui, I highly recommend that you do you reserach, and plan ahead. Otherwise, you will feel like a lot of others on this site that you were nickel and dimed beyond belief. If you don't expect to spend more than you think, then you will feel like you were shorted. We had an awesome Vacation staying at two hotels that were awesome. We expected to pay more than what we did up front, so expect that from the beginning. Email me for your questions or for pictures.

At first we were sad to leave the Sheraton after such a great stay there, but we were very pleasantly surprised by the Grand Wailea especially after all of the negative reviews that it recieved. We arrived at noon (we had to check out of the Sheraton at 11am) and were planning on just relaxing on the beach until our room was available. To our surprise not only was our room available but we had been upgraded to an oceanview room. The view from our room was incredible! Our room was very clean and very comfortable. The huge bathtub was great....especially after our trip from Hana. The beds were very comfortable, our only complaint was the pillows were too fluffy. We asked for flatter pillows the second day and we were happier after that! The pools were crazy, the slides brought out the kid in me. The beach was beautiful. Usually started the day at the beach and then moved to the pools in the afternoon. We never had a problem getting a chair. There was a variety of people at the hotel. Alot of familes with children, but it didn't bother us at all. It was actually kind of neat to see them having a ball on the slides. We did not eat at the hotel much. Had lunch twice. It was overpriced, but so are most hotels in Maui. We got the breakfast buffet the last day and regretted it. The food was okay, but for $28 I expected more. We found great places to eat my scanning the internet for places and viewing their menus and prices. We ate at inexpesive places most of the time and then treated oursleves to a few nice dinners. Mama's Fish House was the best, but I could not afford to eat like that every night! The staff was very accomodating throughout our stay. The day we checked out we had asked about checking out late due to the fact that our flight didn't leave until 10:30pm. The staff informed us that we would not be able to check out late, but that they would provide a room for us to use before leaving for the flight. The room that they provided was greatly appreciated! We spent all day on the beach and were able to shower and change before our 12 hrs flying! I would recommed the Grand Wailea to anyone that I know.

We booked the vacation in December 2006 when Hawaiian Airlines offered exceptional non-stop fares between San Diego and Maui. We paid $1,033 for the three round-trip tickets (inclusive of all taxes). After we decided that Maui would be the destination my wife said, \"I want to stay where Oprah brought her staff.\" I looked into the Grand Wailea and immediately rejected it due to the outrageous cost of the rooms. But my wife persisted so I dug deeper into the internet and found Great Hawaii Vacations, which had a rate for the Grand Wailea that was significantly cheaper than every other place I checked. We booked an \"Ocean Queen / Queen\", which is quoted on the hotel web site as $855 per night plus tax and resort charge. The rate I got was $480/night including tax, which would be an even $500/night including the resort charge. My dealings with Great Hawaii were great and I highly recommend them with this caveat - you will not receive any Hilton Honors points for your stay (including incidentals) if you book through an outside agent. This is a Hilton Honors policy and it is strictly enforced. The hotel front desk team knows the policy and so do the Hilton Honors customer service staff. A few months before the trip I went to Priceline and, for giggles, bid $30/day for a convertible. Much to my pleasant surprise the bid was accepted by Hertz. You must rent a convertible while on Maui - just trust me on this one - and try Priceline first. We had a great flight on Hawaiian into Maui - the plane left San Diego at 8:30 a.m. and arrived on-time. The airport is easy to get through, and after an acceptable wait we had our luggage and were off to the rental car pickup. Getting out of the airport is a breeze and there are well-marked signs that indicate the route to Wailea. Of course, I had directions from Google Maps, which were very accurate. In fact, before the trip I made maps to every place I thought I might want to go, and all the maps were good. Because we arrived at the hotel around noon it was too soon to check-in. The valet staff greeted us with a very warm aloha - we decided to use the valet during the trip (an extra $17/night but well worth it in my opinion). We found the valet service to be exceptional throughout the stay. We rarely had to wait more than a minute or two for our car, they were very friendly, and also offered great suggestions as to where we could eat (and giving great directions). We were also greeted with nice, fresh leis. We were told at the front desk that we would not be able to check-in until 3:00 or 4:00, which was a bit discouraging given that we were tired, esepcially our 7-year-old. We were able to initiate the check-in process so that all we needed to do was pickup our keys. It was at this time that I noticed we had been upgraded to a \"Deluxe Ocean Queen / Queen\", which is listed at $980/night plus tax and resort charge. I did not ask to be upgraded - this was already in the system. The front desk took our cell-phone number and told us we would be called as soon as the room was ready. I'll add here that the front desk staff is very friendly. We checked our luggage, my daughter pulled her bathing suit from her suitcase, and we decided to explore. The front door of the resort is nice but, as many have noted, it is a Disney version of Hawaii. The Wailea area is essentially a desert and the lush tropical setting you see is very much a product of a huge landscaping team and a lot of irrigation. Still, it looks beautiful and helps to set the mood. The hotel lobby is very nice and open as are most of the larger Hawaiian resorts. I was not impressed with the much bally-hooed art collection. We walked to the pool area and, after about 30 minutes, it was just too much tempation for my daughter. We got wristbands (a different color every day to keep out the riff-raff) and my daughter went swimming. The place was absolutely packed. It was a Saturday in late October when school is in session and this place was crawling with kids. We had to look quite hard to find even a single empty beach chair. [Aside - My daughter attends elementary school in the only district in San Diego county that has a fall break. I asked many parents how they managed to come to Maui and all of them said, \"We pulled our kids out of school.\" Do not expect to come to the Grand Wailea in the off-season and see a limited number of kids. However, I saw very few junior-high aged kids, and virtually no high school or college age kids. The place is also crawling with honeymooners.] But back to the beach chair hunt - all you have read is true. The pool opens at 7:00 and the really good spots are taken soon thereafter, but the hotel staff does patrol the area and I saw many instances of chairs being given to other people because they (the chairs) had been unattended for at least an hour. The cabanas and chairs with the built-in umbrellas are a complete rip-off. This hotel is part of the Waldorf-Astoria collection, as is the Arizona Biltmore. The Grand Wailea people need to go to the Biltmore (or any nice hotel on the Las Vegas strip) and see what a cabana is supposed to look like (and cost). After a short amount of swimming it was clear that our daughter was exhausted. I went back to the front desk to check on our room - it still wasn't ready but another \"Deluxe Ocean Queen / Queen\" was available. We took it and were soon in our room relaxing. There is absolutely nothing special about the rooms. There were no weird smells or bugs, but the rooms are definitely no better than what you'll find in any three-star property. The hotel itself is not in tip-top shape as there are scuff marks all over the exterior walls, cracks in tile, messy landscaping in some areas, etc. If you want to see a beautiful hotel that lives up to its rates walk over to the Four Seasons (more on that one later). The rooms are much larger than a standard hotel room yet the bathroom only has one sink. As others have noted, there were many flaws in the room - it is time for a renovation. The TV is not a flat screen, which is what I expect now in a nice hotel. I was disappointed that there was no bottled water waiting for (as is custom for Hilton Honors guests), and this is the first Hilton I have stayed at in at least ten years where I didn't get a paper every morning. [Aside - There are several papers from the mainland available in the hotel sundry store; however, they come one day late and cost about five times what you pay on the mainland, e.g., LA Times = $2.50]. We were on the 8th floor of the northern-most building with a spectacular, unobstructed view of the ocean, Molokini, etc. Is it worth the extra money? No. Much has been said about the outrageous cost of food at this hotel - believe it! However, nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to eat at the hotel. Just up the road a couple of miles is Kihei where you will find any number of places to eat that are extremely reasonable and, as a bonus, filled with locals. Try Kihei Cafe for starters - you'll wake up at 5:00 a.m. the first few days due to the time change and this place will get you started off right. You'll pay less for a full breakfast for two here than you will for a single item at Grand Wailea. We only ate breakfast at Grand Wailea's restaurant (Grand DIning Room) on the last morning. The service was good, the view was great, the food was OK, and the price was high. We grabbed ala carte a couple of times at Cafe Kula - you can save a bit of money this way but it is still expensive. Surprisingly, the similar restuarant at Fairmont Kea Loni (a 10-15 minute walk south on the ocean-front boardwalk) is better quality and less expensive. I would steer far away from Big Wave cafe in Kihei - one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. For lunch we typically ate poolside at Grand Wailea and, yes, paid dearly for the pleasure. The service isn't bad, the food is OK, and the prices are consistent with what you pay at any high-end resort. The burgers are cooked on a big bbq right next to the pool so you know things are fresh. A burger will cost you $15 but it is only an extra quarter for cheese and an extra quarter on top of that for bacon. The drinks are expensive ($12 for a mai tai) but they pack a wallop. I highly recommend the swim-up bar. It is fun and the service is fantastic. We saw the same bartender every day - he looked like a cross between Andy Warhol and Ed Begley, Jr. Same prices for drinks as anyplace else around the pool but a great atmosphere. The slides are fun, the pools are fun, and things are actually a lot quieter than you'd expect given the number of people. I had no problem falling asleep in my chair each day. One quibble - the pool temperature could be higher. I would guess the temperature to be no higher than 80 degrees - I prefer warmer. The ocean/beach in front of the hotel is nice - the water is fairly calm and the temperature was about 78 degrees. There is some fun snorkeling immeidately north of the hotel beach (about 100 feet) where a small reef juts out from the shoreline. It was crawling with fish. You need to do your snorkeling early in the morning before the winds come up and make things choppy. Our routine was breakfast, pool at 7:00 to get chairs, snorkel, and then back to pool. If you snorkel, and you must, I have two recommendations. First, get your snorkel equipment at Snorkel Bob's in Kihei. The quality of the equipment is first rate, the price is right (we paid about $80 for a week-long rental for all three of us), and the service is exceptional. Second, you've got to take a trip to Molokini crater. For me this was the highlight of the vacation. In my mind there is only one way to take this trip and that is the sunrise cruise on the Molokini Express from Kai Kanani Charters. You can find them on the web or in the Maui Prince hotel. The trip leaves at 6:30 sharp from the beach in front of the Maui Prince. Why this trip? The boat is brand new; the crew is fantastic; you are only 15 minutes away from the crater; the early hour means the ocean water is smooth as glass; and you will be done snorkleing before any of the other boats arrive. Let me repeat that - on this cruise you will have the entire crater to yourself. On our way back we passed at least seven huge boats full of people - it was hard not to feel smug. The charter includes continental breakfast and a stop at Turtle Town, where we saw incredible sea turtles. Another recommendation - do the Old Lahaina Luau. We actually did not do a luau while on Oahu two years ago as our hotel concierge said, \"Honestly, if you want to see a real luau you've got to go to Maui.\" Even on Maui there are cheesy luaus - not the Old Lahaina luau. The service was incredible, the setting was great, the pig pulled from the emu is the one you eat that evening (unlike at most luaus), the drinks were stiff, and the entertainment was fantastic. The number of performers is quite large - at least two dozen and the music is all performed live (two different sets of musicians). Further, the entertainment is true to Hawaii - don't go expecting to see swords and fire - that isn't Hawaii. Lahaina is a big tourist trap - how many t-shirt shops, art galleries, jewelry stores, and sunglass shops does a town need? But go for the luau! As a bonus, the drive from Wailea is great! We didn't eat a single dinner at the Grand Wailea - we ate three dinners at the Four Seasons, including the Lobby Lounge, Ferreros (spelling?), and Spago. The mai-tai I had a Ferreros was the best I've ever had. I highly recommend Ferreros - the setting is magnificent, the food is great, and the service is outstanding. The Lobby Lounge and Spago are what you expect from Four Seasons but Ferreros was a notch above. Indeed, I would much prefer to stay at Four Seasons or Fairmont Kea Loni but having a seven-year-old makes the Grand Wailea the better choice. The weather was incredible the entire trip - not a drop of rain or even the threat of rain, and very limited clouds. I would go back to Maui again tomorrow if there weren't so many other places I want to visit, e.g., Big Island and Kauai.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cPoolahpalooza\u201d", "Author": "Sassypants01", "ReviewID": "UR10475414", "Content": "We stayed here & the Four Seasons during our week on Maui.

The trip started off terribly, we were flying from NY-LAX-OGG, our flight from NY to LAX was fine, little did we know that we would be layed over @ LAX for 11 1/2 hrs, yes thats right almost a 12 hr flight delay, it was the most miserable experience ever, not to mention that my car rental company wouldnt stay opend for us THANX ALAMO! anyway, once we got to the GW @ about 1am, there were about 3 employees running the show. The min. we stepped into the lobby, we had forgotten all about our terrible experience, the flight and all our troubles had just melted away, instantly. The lobby is all open air, with lush foliage all over the place, gorgouse art, (and im not an art freek at all). We were greeted with a beautiful lei and an upgrade to the Napua Tower, wich entitled us to complimentary breakfast daily and apps & cocktails in the evening, it was also a gated community, where the only access was with your room key, i nearly cryed when she told us we were upgraded, i felt like we had hit lotto, LOL.

We were very close to the lounge that was serving breakfast, they had a nice arrangement of muffins, breads, fruits, cereal, yogurt, Starbucks Coffee, eggs, meats, cheeses, they basically had everything, and you can take your plate and eat out on the lanai, warining, the birds are NOT shy, LOL. We went down to the pool/waterpark, how amazing. We spent the whole day running around like kids, i was waterlogged by the time we got back to the room. We spent some time at the adult pool that was nice for a break from the kids but i loved the activity pool, we took a ride on the water elevator, it was a blast, the water slides were legitamate waterslides not some cheesey slides. We sat by the adult pool and ordered some lava flows, they were really good, but very pricy, but hey your on Maui and staying in Wailea for god sakes-u gotta expect that! Service was second to none, i had called up the concierge to get restaurant suggestions, the guy didnt even turn his nose up or show attitude when i told him \"something not too pricey\", he gave us a great suggestion and we had a wonderful dinner at Longhies, it was walking distance right at the shops @ Wailea, not to be confused with the Wailea Shops. Shops @ Wailea are up the road just a bit, there is a short cut through the tiki torches at the entrance to the hotel. We did not valet the car, they had a parking garage that was the next right after the main entrance, you had acess with your room key and it was free of charge and there was also a back entrance to the hotel from there, again, there was no snobbery when we asked if there was a garage we can park ourselves. The beach fronting the hotel was awesome as well, not crowded, the water was clean, mostely calm except for the far left side where there is supposed to be good snorkeling. If i went to Wailea again, i would never stay anywhere else, this place was spectacular and i would suggest it to ANYONE!

OK, the pool areas are pretty cool and well designed, and if you're looking for a Snazzy Jazzy resort, to LOOK AT, this is it. But the \"Upscale Resort\" appeal stops there. It's not as if there was bad service, but it ceratinly wasn't great. You'd get the same at a Ramada. The sunsets on the beach are beautiful, but why not enjoy them with a $7 beer or a $14 drink? The place is relatively clean, but it's obvious nothing has been done since it was first built. It's aging and it shows it. Do NOT order room service. The food is God awful. In fact, with the one exception of the PU PU platter at Humu Humu, the food was mediocre at best, and just plain BAD. Eat off sight if you can. The buffet at Kincha, the Japanese restautant was OK, but on par with what one would find at a Holiday Inn, NOT the Grand Wailea at 400 bucks a night.

I just returned from a 9 days stay at the GW (Oct 5-13). Our family of 4 with 2 girls 6 and 4 has more fun on Maui than any of the other Hawaiian islands. This is my 12th Visit to Maui and my 3rd stay at the GW. I loved the Resort so much so that 4 years ago I bought a memebrship to the GW that gives you 50% off the rack rate on all the rooms. If you're budget conscious Maui and the GW is a expensive place to visit, but if you're looking for a fun hawaiian getaway with an expectation of higher average cost then there is no other place to go on your vacation. As a season traveler I've stayed in many 4-5 star hotels in all of the Hawaiian Islands ( 4seasons Hualalai, KapaluaRitz, Kaanapali Hyatt, Hyatt Kauai, Marriott Kauai, Kaanapali Westin, Fairmont Kea Lani, Fairmont Orchid, PrinceVille, Turtle Bay) so I have a good refernce point to compare the quality of the resorts. So here are the Good, The Bad and The Ugly: The Good The GW is a gorgeous resort on one of the most beautiful stretch of beach in the world. The sunsets are dramatic and breath taking. I usually take a beach chair with the wife and kids and just take in the view almost every night. The grounds are kept for the most part clean and well manicured around the resort building. The open Lobby is an inviting tropical setting with millions of dollars worth of art and scultures. And of course the famous pools, pools, and more pools!!! The GW is either a hotel with an awesome water slide park or a water slide park with great hotel! The pools are is divided in 3 sections --the upper small pools, the main pools with a sand bottom childs area and the adult pool. Each pool area has its own vibe and types of people. There are 3 small pools in the upper section and has mainly familys with children that can swim and want to be near the smaller slides. The main pool is where most of the guest congregate. It tends to be most crowded and noisiest ,but if you're enjoying the pools like the others you won't notice the noise. The Adult pool allows those over 18 but I've seen some \"tweenager\" inhabiting the pool at times. This is great place to read and have quiet converstion--very relaxing. To cap it all off the slides are what make the GW a uniquely fun place. There are 2 fast and furious slides and 5 smaller slides the little ones and big kids would love comming down on. My kids developed fins after spending most of their days in the pools. During the peak summer season chairs are taken up ealy in the mornings but we didn't have problems finding a seat during our Oct stay. The Grand Dinning is a good but expensive place to dine. I highly recommend that you try their Sunday brunch buffet, but their breakfast buffet is just OK. Kincha is there Japanese themed restaurant and it's quite good but expensive. My wife and I tried their Weekend sushi buffet and it was fabulous. For relatively cheap and good eats try the Kula cafe for informal dining --the average cost is anywhere from $7-$14 per meal. The Bad Expect to pay for extras. Be expected to be nickled and dimed with various resort fees, taxes and use of ameneties (extra small fridge was $25). The Cabanas, shaded private lounge chairs, and beach umbrellas cost extra and the price is a exorbitent. The 4 Season next door will give you all these for free. The pool area needs some updating and repairs on their cracked tiles in the pools and walk ways. The Ugly During our stay they had a large convention about 400 people. They basically took over the resort and turned the GW into a frat party/spring break. They were mostly young, tatooed , drunk, loud, obnoxiuos and seemed like they never stayed in a nice resort before. One of the concierge told me that some of them were sent home for damagaing their room--what is this spring break in orlando at a Motel 6!!! Every morning the entire place was deserted and we had the entire pool to ourselves but then at 1pm when the convention got out there was wall to wall people in the pool with beers in their hand. The atmoshere was not condusive for families while the conventioneers where out. The Conclusion. The mostly good out ways the bad and ugly. I would ask the reservation desk if you plan vacation at the GW if there is a large convention during your stay and if there is one I would consider another date. All in all, my kids had a great time and because of that we will be back for our 4th time soon. Have an expection to pay extra for ameneties--Maui is an expensive place to visit. Tips Along trying the great dinning establishment (Spago, Roys, Mamma's fish house, many others) you need to try some of the local fare. I love hawaiian mixed plate ( meat side dish, with two soops of rice and hawaiian macaroni salad) and there are few good place that servce the locals. Try \"Da Kitchen\" in Kihei, L and L (various locations) and Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina ( great and inexpesive outdoor dinning). The food is good and cheap--under $10 in all these place.

I love shopping at the shops, we like eating at the restaurants in the Shops of Wailea and we loooove having dinner at Spago and Ferraros which are both restaurants located at the Four Seasons, and we love the breakfast buffet at the Four Seasons.

We've always dreamed of visiting Hawaii and we decided to book a trip May 17, 2007 for 10 days. We started our trip by visiting the Big Island, Hawaii for 3 days and then went to Maui & stayed at the Grand Wailea Resort Hotel & Spa for the remainder of our trip. I did alot of research prior to the trip & watched several Discovery Channel shows on Hawaii which is how I discovered the Grand Wailea. We rented a car on both islands (I highly suggest this & be sure to get a navigational system with the car). When we arrived, we were greated with a lei (which was nice as we had not received one at the airport which disapointed me) and were escorted to the front desk for checkin. During my research, I discovered that the hotel has a \"secret hotel\" within the hotel which is used by many celebritys and bigwigs :). We had reserved a regular ocean front room, but I teased the desk clerk by asking if our room was in this secret part of the hotel (which was definately out of our price range). To my delight, he upgraded us to one of these rooms. Wasn't that NICE!!!!! Let me just say that it was FABULOUS!!! We had the most beautiful bathroom with pink marble and the room was terrific with a wonderful ocean view and private balcony. Also, we received complimentary breakfast each morning (no crowds) and cocktails in the evening. What a wonderful treat! The property was beautiful, the pool was amazing and we never had trouble finding lounge chairs. The beach was nice but the water was rather cold so we stayed at the pool. We ate at a couple of restaurants which were very nice & delicious but rather pricey. The boutiques at the hotel are great!!! I bought a very pretty bathing suit (which was altered for a small price and delivered to my room the same day), pretty beaded flip-flops, and my husband bought me a FABOULOUS purse! They also had artists visit the property on certain days and their works were truly beautiful! We are divers and we booked an excursion that went to Molokini and Turtle Island - it was wonderful! The water clarity was amazing but be sure to take the early morning (6:00 a.m) dive as Molokini gets very busy in the afternoon and the water clarity diminishes in the afternoon due to the tradewinds. The dives were great - we saw sea turtles (HUGE), stingrays, small sharks, blowfish, eels, large sea urchins and great corals. We also booked a tour for the road to Hana and were very glad we did (rather than driving ourselves)! The driver was terrific and we learned so much about the culture and history of Hawaii. Hana is a full day excursion and the views are simply breathtaking. Definately try to visit the seven pools - we didn't go in the water but the VIEWS - wow!!! There are also vendors at certain parts of the road that sell pretty seashell necklaces. We found that the \"Elvis\" lady sold the prettiest necklaces, but don't ask her about We discovered Lahaina and loved it! It's a nice little town about 1/2 hour drive from GW. We bought some wonderful artwork from a Christian Lassan gallery and some beautiful tahitian pearls and we loved BJ's Pizza (ate there 2 times). We also bought some darling clothes for my 2 year old daughter and the prices were great! I can't say enough about Lahaina!! We also were able to book the Old Lahaina Luah! TIP - you must book this in advance of your vacation. When we arrived at the hotel, I tried to book this luah and they informed us that it was sold out for the entire week and there was a waiting list of 70 people. I asked to be placed on the list anyway and 4 days later I still had not received word of availability so I called back on my own. The representative informed me that they were still sold out and asked if I was on the waiting list. I told her yes and gave her my last name but she couldn't find it and that was that. After I persisted, she finally located my name and told me we could come the next evening but no promises! Long story short, we were able to get in and really enjoyed the show and the food - I definately recommend this and it's in Lahaina, so you could go in the early afternoon, eat at BJ's, shop and then catch the show that evening! I highly recommend staying at the Grand Wailea. The staff was great and the property is secluded and beautiful! It was a once in a lifetime trip for us and the staff made it extra special for us!

Waited in line 15 minutes to do this, which is fine. Afterwards, we spent time in the pool til around 4pm. At which time, we checked our cellphone to find out our room was ready. Went back to front desk and the person checking me in, kept asking me if someone from my party had checked in earlier - which was a definite no because we stayed at the pool together the entire time. He went to the back to get our room keys... and couldn't find them. So he came back out and had to make new room keys. This whole process took about 30 minutes - which should have taken only a few minutes since I checked in earlier that day. Went to the room, which is definitely less than desirable (old carpets in bathroom, mold, actually it smelled like someone urinated in the room) - this place could definitely use some refurbishing. Anyways our room was located at the furtherest point from the lobby but was right next to the self-parking garage and way far away from valet parking. Because of this we decided to self park rather than use valet. However, everytime that we tried to self-park there were no parking spaces left. Finally, irritated we phoned the front desk... they said we could park in handicapped since there was no parking available. Our last complaint is that because we were leaving on an early flight the next morning - I visited the front desk to check-out early the night before. I was assured that we would be able to still get back into the room... wouldn't you know that when we returned (late at night with my 6 year old son) we couldn't get back into the room. So I called front desk and they told me that everything should be working correctly however they patched me through to someone else who then told me our keys were deactivated. So security had to come up and let us back in the room. Also, when I told the front desk of our dissatisfaction - it was only a grumble of - I'm sorry to hear that. The grounds of this hotel are very beautiful. The pools were lots of fun for my son. However, with all the problems I do not believe that it would be worth it to stay here again.

We made our reservation about 10 months prior to checking in to the Grand Wailea. When we made our reservation, we specifically requested a king room. Upon arrival we were told they didn't have any king rooms left and only had a room with 2 queens. After the person went into the back room to talk to room control (I picture a geeky man with 10 monitors in front of him watching what customers in the lobby were doing), she came back. We were told that we could check back the next day, or they could \"sheet 2 queen beds as one\" and we wouldn't know the difference. The second option didn't sound so bad so we agreed. When we arrived in our room we found two queen beds pushed up against each other, not sheeted as one. You couldn't even pull the sheets or the comforter out of the bed because they were pushed up against each other. The headboards are attached to the wall, so they were not even behind the bed. It looked retarded and wasn't functional. (I posted a picture). Because the night stand normally is in the middle of the beds, of course there was only one night stand, which was about a 10 foot journey away from where I was to sleep. I'm paying $400 a night to put my glass on the floor and not be able to pull the comforter out from being tucked in? And, oh, did I mention it was the handicap room, so there were bars everywhere and all of the furniture was severely banged up. (For the record, we were paying about $400/night due to our group discount, but the cheapest rate I could find on our room type was about $800/night). The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the room stunk. The tile shower was nasty, it had a fold up seat and the tile itself was groddy. My bathroom at home is by far nicer than this room. I have a hard time paying $400/night+ to stay at a place that's not as nice as what I have at home. There's nothing luxurious about that. The kicker here is my mom checked just before me the same day and she had requested 2 queens and ended up with 1 king in the same room type as I (which was an upgrade from the room type she had booked). So clearly the GW is very bad at planning and didn't even bother to read the customer requests. For the prices they charge, this is ridiculous. The next morning we went to ask if they had any rooms open up. She went into the control room and came back and told us no there was nothing they could do. No apology, just a \"no.\" This was not a satisfactory answer so we pressed on. Eventually she came out of the control room and said they'd have a room available after the people checked out today. She told us to go to our rooms, bring our luggage to the lobby by noon, and they'd call us on our cell phone when the room was ready. (No offer of help from the bell captain). So we went to our room, and basically checked out by noon. We left our luggage with the bell captain and went off on our day. At about 4pm we went to the desk to ask why they hadn't called. They said they didn't have any rooms still. This was completely unsatisfactory, so we of course demanded something be done. Somewhere there was a king room in this monster of a hotel. After 10 minutes in the control room she came out and said they had a room and the baggage would be sent up. We were *shocked* to see that our luggage was still sitting at the bell captain desk in the middle of the lobby--for a good 6 hours. Much of the time there's nobody at the desk and anyone could've just walked up and stole the $5000 of electronics and other goodies I had in my bags (we were there for a wedding). All along, no apologies from the staff whatsoever. We went to our new room, waited about 30 minutes for our luggage before having to call to ask where it was. 10 minutes later half of our luggage arrived. They didn't know about the other half so they went back to check. That came another 15 minutes after. The bell captain--who was the only friendly person we talked to the entire time in our 10 day stay--told us he had been there since GW opened and since Hilton took over management it's gone downhill. They've laid off over 400 workers and raised the prices without making any improvements whatsoever. He explained our room was painted instead of wallpapered because that's there temporary fix for the mildew that grows all under the wallpaper. The room stunk like a wet basement, we had to keep the doors open the entire time otherwise it got much worse (and of course, every time the cleaning crew came they closed it, so every time we returned our room was nasty smelling). The room we were given was a JR. suite, which meant it had a nicer bathroom-the size of the room itself was the same. One of the chairs was instead replaced with a sofa (though as far as I can tell it was not a sofa that was purchased in the last 10 years), and the minibar was a little bigger. The service here is not what you'd expect from anything higher than a 3 star hotel. The employees reminded me a lot of airline employees. Many had been there a long time and reveled about what the Grand Wailea once was, and were probably jaded by what it is today. Pretty much everyone we encountered was just there squeaking by but not overly friendly, if at all friendly. When you stay at a Ritz or pretty much any hotel charging these types of rates, they greet you by your name at least once in awhile. Not once did anyone even attempt to mutter anything resembling my name. I'm not snobby or anything, but a hotel like this is made or broken by small, cute details like this that make you feel important. The desk staff were completely unfriendly. The setting in Maui is hard to ruin, really. A dumpy condo on a beach will still look beautiful. But it all felt really Disneyseque. The area of Wailea would basically be a desert if they hadn't altered the environment. Everything here is fake--trees, plants, waterfalls are all fake, nothing like this would naturally grow there or exist at this part of the island. It didn't feel remotely natural, this kind of rubbed me the wrong way... I could go to Disneyworld and see fake waterfalls, it's a much cheaper flight. I feel sorry for those who go to Grand Wailea and don't venture out beyond the area to see anything natural in its natural setting. Also, the palm trees were so high they blocked much of the ocean view you would have if they weren't so high. Even though it's next to the ocean, don't expect to hear the ocean... all you hear are the fake waterfalls. The place is too big. They show two parking lots on their map--what they don't tell you is one is valet only. The other one is at the far end of the hotel. Our room at the far opposite end of the hotel was a good 20 or 25 minute walk to our car; and the lot itself was constantly full. When parking, there were always people trolling the parking lot waiting for people to leave so they could have a spot. (Our friends who went at a different time of the year told us how they had the same problem and ended up parking at the lowest level in the employee parking area). The pools sound nice, but they're overran with bratty 10 year olds during the day whose parents are off sipping $13 margaritas. The pool closes at 11pm and the water slide and other water features are only open from 10am-5pm. The 2 or 3 waterslides and water elevator easily took about 15 minutes waiting in line to get in, and weren't really anything exciting. The water elevator was fun once or twice but really it was a lot of waiting around for nothing. The swim up bar wasn't open until noon and closed at 5. The food at the restaurants was severely overpriced. ($11 for a bagel and cream cheese). We ate breakfast there once, my eggs benedict I ordered had a plastic wrapper in the middle that I only discovered after chewing it in my mouth. They wouldn't comp it, only bring a new one. The $30 breakfast buffet didn't have anything too special on it. I personally thought ordering a breakfast entree ($25ish) was a better deal since it was actually something that was cooked to order. The golf course restaurant across the street (Sea Watch) was 1/2 the price, nicer view, quieter, and friendlier waitresses. We ate dinner at one of their other restaurants, both having different local fish specials. One of our fish entrees came out way way overdone. (Their onion rings are indeed amazing though). Our room wasn't thorougly cleaned the entire time we were there. Sure they made the bed and what not, but there were ring marks from glasses on our desk the entire time we were there. In fact there were a few ring marks when we arrived at our room the first day that weren't even ours. I had bought some bath salts at lush prior to arriving and had anticipating a nice soak in the tub or two, but after seeing it I didn't trust it was clean enough to actually do this... BTW, what luxury hotel these days doesn't give you slippers? Or bath salts? Or for that matter a refrigerator? Also, the maid seemed spacey in that one day she took our robes but didn't replace them, and another day our bath mat disappeared. We didn't have a room service menu--or any hotel information book in our room, so we called to ask for one. They didn't bring one, so we wrote a note to the cleaning woman the next day asking if we could have one. We were left with a photocopy of the room service menu, but no hotel info booklet. They nickel and dime you to death. $2.50/day for cleaning--just enough to not care, just enough to be annoyed that they bother to do it at all. $25 for a mini-fridge. The craziest charge I recall is a $10 *per person* to carry bags to your room (they don't tell you this until checkout). etc etc. When we pulled up to the lobby to unload our bags, a valet came and immediatly tried to take our keys and give us a valet tag. We told them we were just unloading bags. He took the keys anyway, saying that we couldn't drive the car to the side of the driveway ourself to let it sit for 5 minutes, he had to. After checking in, we returned to get our car and self parked it. At check out, there was a $25 or so valet charge on our bill from this incident. The in room high speed Internet isn't truly high speed. It's 128kbps, which is a lot slower than the cheapest DSL you can buy. It's not fast enough to support a business traveler who needs a VPN connection. You can upgrade to a true 512 kbps high speed at a cost of $15 a day. Also, they didn't provide an ethernet cable. The little black box has one built in but it was only 1', so you couldn't even move your laptop around on the desk let alone anywhere other than the desk. The access is provided by Lodgenet. Lodgenet charges the Grand Wailea for every \"black box\" they have connected, so what does Grand Wailea do? They unplug the black box from all of their rooms so they aren't registered on the system. The problem is nowhere do they tell you this, it's not designed to be unplugged so it's not in any instructions they have. I called the front desk to tell them my Internet wasn't working--without saying anything they forwarded my call to a 1-800 number and I had to chat on the phone for about 20 minutes before we realized what they did. I had to crawl on the floor to trace a cable that ran behind the TV in order to plug it back in. I called the front desk to complain of this, they acted like it was an accident. The problem is I was in 4 other rooms and they too ALL had the black Lodgenet box unplugged. One of our friends who was staying there at the time was mentioning her Internet wasn't working and just gave up. I imagine this is what the GW hopes for. I can't even believe what cheapskates the people running this hotel are! They do have wireless Internet but it's only designed to work in certain areas near the middle of the grounds in the outside area. Our first room we were able to pick up the signal if we moved to a certain area on the balcony though. On the second room we weren't able to even see the network in our list. How can a hotel charging $800/night for rooms not have wireless Internet? All in all, I've had better experiences at hotels that were 1/4 the price. Fake scenery. check. Jaded staff. check.

I want to write this review to encourage others who may want to get married on Maui because my wedding day at the Grand Wailea was so wonderful, stress free, and beautiful. I'd been to the Grand Wailea several times in my teens and thought that the wedding chapel was so gorgeous. I knew someday I'd want to get married there. I'd never stayed at the hotel until my wedding night. I did have several wedding planners and agree that something must be going on there because of the high turnover rate. Luckily, the 3rd wedding planner was the nicest and she was the one who oversaw my big day. I like to plan things myself, but it was nice to plan things myself, then have someone else worry about how it would all happen. The wedding, pictures, and especially that wedding DVD could not have been topped. The wedding planner we had was named Noelani. I was hoping our room would be ready for me to get ready in early in the day before our sunset wedding. Noelani called me the morning of the wedding to say that she was working on an upgrade for us. We'd booked a partial ocean view w/king bed. It was going to be about $700 and we were staying for 2 nights. When it was time to get ready to go to the hotel, Noelani called again to say that there was a room overlooking the chapel for me to get ready in, but that our room would not be ready until after the wedding and we could move our things then. I told her it was OK, I'd rather just have a room and not have to move. She told me that she had an upgraded room available and that I would probably like it, so I agreed and arranged for my sister and best friend to help out with moving things over. After our wedding and pictures, my sister came and said that everything was moved to our \"upgraded\" room. I asked if it was pretty nice. She said, \"Yeah, if you like full panoramic view, several rooms, and two bathrooms.\" I said, \"Really?\" Not quite understanding what it might be. I thought maybe we'd have a full ocean view or something. Noelani upgraded us to the $6,000 per night Royal Hawaiian Suite. Only one room, a $10,000 room , was more grand. Our Royal Suite was so amazing, we brought everyone up to see it. I'll never forget what the Grand Wailea did for us. I didn't ask for an upgrade, they just did it. I also know that this may not happen to many other brides and it probably can't be expected. I was married on a Monday night. Maybe that had something to do with it. All I know is that I've never heard of anyone else receiving such royal treatment at a hotel on their wedding night. I saw the Four Seasons next door and it can't compare to the Grand Wailea Seaside Chapel as a place for a wedding. We just got back from the Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island. I saw an outdoor wedding there and thought that maybe the Hilton could rival the Grand Wailea if you want an outdoor wedding. But if you want the most beautiful wedding chapel overlooking the ocean at a very grand hotel with beautiful wedding picture spots, then the Grand Wailea is the place to be.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, KS", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Time\u201d", "Author": "PZ13", "ReviewID": "UR8712269", "Content": "First and foremost, I am not a picky traveler. My wife and I are in our late 20's. We stayed at the Grand Wailea from Sep.1-8. In the last three years we have been to St. Lucia (honeymoon), Atlantis-Bahamas and this year the Grand Wailea in Maui. I think that both the Atlantis and Grand Wailea blew away St. Lucia. We had a great honeymoon there at the time but after you travel to the other two hotels, you are in a different world. Yes, the Grand Wailea is expensive.... that is if you let it be. Yes, there is a $25 service charge per night that the hotel adds to your bill. We did arrive at 1:30 to find out our room was not ready. Were we annoyed after a long flight? Maybe slightly but c'mon this is a vacation, put all your annoyances and problems away, you are in Paradise! We took advantage of the time and familiarized our self with the resort, we walked around and check out the grounds. They called us in an hour and told us our room was ready, no bigggie. We had the Ocean View Room, which was great. We were in the Lagoon wing, where it was kind of tropical. The view was just fine. We had a partial view of the ocean but mostly it was the palm trees. They put us on the 3rd floor, which is the top level in that wing. We had a great view of one of the pools and it was very convenient having the pools right there. I think the biggest difference between the Atlantis and Grand Wailea was the convenience and that you have a balcony to enjoy the splendid view. The sunsets were unbelievable from our balcony! We only at the Resort three times in the 8 days we spent there. That was the one time we forked out $50 on lunch and drinks at the pool. The other two times we had room service. Yes, the pizza might have cost $20 but it was huge and neither of us could finish it. The second time we had a Turkey Club and a Grilled Chicken salad, which were good portions. That came out to be $35 with the service and delivery fee. Never would we step foot in the other restaurants, way too expensive for the food that you get. On the way from the airport we did stop by Safeway and bought some snacks, breakfast bars and most importantly a 24 pack of water. At the Grand Wailea water is not hard to come by but at the Atlantis it's like $5 a bottle, absolute rip off! We also loaded up on alcoholic beverages and made our own mixers in our room. I would advise you to have them bring you a fridge to your room for a one time $25 fee, it is worth it, believe me! I Instead of dining at the resort we found some good places in Kihei, a town that is right next to Wailea. Make sure you rent a car in Maui, it only cost us $150 for a week through Alamo and we got a Mustang convertible. That was the smartest thing we ever did. There is a great breakfast place in Kihei right off Pilani Hwy. I read about this place on one of the reviews here. They are so nice there, it's a hole in the wall but the food is soooo good and they prices are so reasonable. For two, with a 20-25% tip, we walked out of breakfast for in between $18-23. We had breakfast there twice and we also went there for lunch one time. Lunch came out to be in between $25-$30 with tip, which is not too bad. The macadaimia banana nut pancackes were to die for. I would suggest getting just two, I made the mistake of getting 3 and I only finished 1/2 my meal and I can eat. They also have great potatoes for bkfast. For lunch we got a turkey club wrap and the mahi mahi wrap, both were fabulous, I would have to give the edge to the mahi mahi wrap. There was this other breakfast place that we ate at in Kihei, after our surfing lessons, that was awesome. It is right off S. Kiehi road. I believe the name was Kihei cafe, it's another hole in the wall, they serve breakfast all day and open at 5am. It is right across the street from a park where we took our surfing lessons. Make sure you get a seat on the outdoor patio, it can get crowded there come 8am. For dinner, besides the two times we had room service or the Luau that we attended, we ate at Moose McGillycuddy's. We enjoyed our experience the first time that we went back again. The fish tacos are heaven there and their happy hour from 3-6 rocks. They have $2 Mai Tai's, $2 beers, it's awesome. They have a incredible view of the ocean, both times we ate there, we were sat next to a window and watched the beautiful Maui sunsets. Next door is Fred's, it's a Mexican bar & pub from what I heard the best margaritta's and great food. It seemed like Fred's was the place to be, but we enjoyed the laid back Moose McGillycuddy's. Plus the service there was great. Both times we got out of there for under $55. This included drinks, appetizer, two meals, and desert. Not bad for Maui if you ask me! Maybe it was easier for us to go out and explore the island since we did not have kids and drive around to find these places. I know for some people it is easier to just stay at the resort and dine. There was this one restaurant at the shops at Wailea that the food was absolutley atrocius, it was some burger joint that I could not remember the name of. I thought 8 days on Maui was not enough. You need atleast 10-14 to be able to do a good amount of stuff. We went on a 5 hour snorkeling adventure which was awesome. We also took surfing lessons, a must! There was the helicopter tour of West Maui and Molokai, the Sunrise on top of Haleakala Volcano and the 28 mile bike down following- awesome adventure. I recommend doing this the first or second day you are there, as you are still on your mainland time.... they pick you up from your hotel at 2:30am. It makes it for a long day as you get dropped back off at noon. The one activity we looked forward to doing was the ziplines, I had booked those two weeks ahead of time, as it can be hard to book with the popularity of them. That morning after a one hour drive to Kannapali from Wailea, they call us when we are 5 minutes from their store and tell us all tours have been canceled due to a technical malfunction. We were really disappointed as we really had been looking forward ot this. So, we had to make the best of it and book another adventure. All in all, we had a fabulous time in Maui. I mean c'mon, it's Hawaii for gosh sakes! It's a time where you get a chance to get away from the everyday hussle and bussle and just relax. We would for sure come back to Maui. Next time we might stay up North by Lahaina and Kannapali just to try something new but I wouldn't mind staying at the Grand Wailea again.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice resort\u201d", "Author": "vashtiseven", "ReviewID": "UR8698838", "Content": "Overall, this was a pleasant stay. The grounds are beautiful and the beach was just a few steps away from the rooms. The view from our room in the chapel wing was amazing. I found most of the staff to be pleasant and accommodating. With all of that said, I don't think I would pay $600.00 a night for the room I stayed in. (I went with my husband on a business trip and his employer foot the bill) The rooms are nice, but nothing extravagent. The bathrooms are in need of some serious TLC. The tiles are white and the grout is orange or brown. The shower door was water stained and the room smelled like mildew. Also, I agree with my fellow reviewers regarding the nickel and diming going on at the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea takes full advantage of charging for anything extra. (Example: we were charged $18.00 just to print our boarding passes.) Also, we ate at the Huma Huma restaurant and were very disappointed. (High prices and not very good food.) If you want a really good lunch, try Cafe Ole in Kihea. It was very good and reasonably priced. Camp Grande for kids is also expensive, but the women who work there are nice. The only complaint I have re: Camp Grande is that they told me two women would be watching my children and when we went to leave them, they said it was just going to be one man. I didn't like leaving them for the 2 hours anyway, and this made me really uncomfortable. When I communicated this to the women checking my kids in, she told me she would stay instead. She didn't stay, but she did get another woman to come stay in her place. My kids said they had an okay time. So, overall it was a good stay, but I would research other options before returning to The Grand Wailea.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cStorybook Stay at the Grand Wailea\u201d", "Author": "JustaTravler", "ReviewID": "UR8672361", "Content": "My husband and I were married at the Wailea Seaside Chapel and couldn't have asked for a more amazing day...of course, we had to fight for it.

Over the course of a year and a half, I was erroneously charged two times, experienced poor customer service over the phone and was highly dissappointed in the Weddings Department. For the reputation of the hotel and the high cost associated with getting married there, I was extremely dissappointed in the level of attention I wasn't receiving and the high turnover of Wedding Coordinators (I had a total of 4 different coordinators!). Armed with documentation of all that went wrong prior to arriving on the island, I was extremely impressed with the staff for rectifying my dissappointment. My husband and I were upgraded to an Ocean View room that overlooked the Chapel and were subsequently happy with our decision to stay at the Grand Wailea. One obvious not of distinction regarding this hotel is their ridiculously priced food and beverages (true of most of the island), and the hotel's ability to attach a charge to everything. For instance, a charge of 5 dollars was attached to our bill because our half-eaten wedding cake was delivered to our room. Along with another 5 dollar charge when we requested utensils to eat it.

While researching for hotels, we noted that everyone hyped up two hotels: Grand Wailea and Four Seasons Maui. The two hotels are located side by side, so we decided to split our vacation between the two hotels. We stayed at the Four Seasons and then moved to the Grand Wailea for the later part of our trip. In summary, my wife and I were very disappointed with Grand Wailea. Below is some information that we hope could help others in making a decision if you are unsure between the two hotels. Check in (1): Normal check in is around 3:30 pm. Four Seasons (FS) - We arrived at the FS from the airport at noon. Even thought the hotel was fully sold out, they were able to find us a room without any waiting time. Grand Wailea (GW) - We arrived at the GW from the FS at noon. We were not checked in until 3pm. Supposedly there were no rooms available, while we knew by looking at Hilton.com that there were availabilities in all room classes. Check in (2): Front desk FS - Very polite and welcoming. Great to deal with. GW - Very cold and unwelcoming. We felt like they are paying us to stay there even though it was costing us $700/night. Room: FS - Beautiful rooms with the best bathroom i've seen at any hotel (and my wife and I are frequent travelers) GW - Outdated rooms. Outdated bathrooms. You feel like you're back in the 80s. Pool: I give the edge to the GW just because of the waterpark for kids. Many slides that adults could even enjoy. Pool service: Edge to the FS by far. Very bad service. Cold staff. Cost:(we booked 5 months in advance) FS - $400/night GW - $700/night Overall, our experience at FS was amazing. We'd go back to that hotel any time. We really loved it. Our experience at the GW was pretty bad (even through we paid $300 more a night), mostly as a result of the bad service and the room condition. It was obvious that guest service was very weak at the GW and we just did not feel welcomed there.

One of the reasons for writing the review is to warn honeymooners that this is not the place to be. We've traveled extensively and usually stay at the Ritz. Friends suggested the GW because of the kiddie slides. All I kept thinking as I searched for a lounge chair near the slides (don't be scared, you can find them) is why would a couple without kids stay here? The spa is beautiful. As a matter of fact, my young daughters and I had treatments together. But after viewing the Four Seasons next door and the peace and serenity I would stay there. A week before we left I found out that you could purchase day passes for the GW slides yet not be a registered guest, that may account for the crowds and dirtiness in the slide area. Be prepared to spend $$ at every turn but we usually just chalk it up to vacation. Service is accomodating but certainly not warm or overextending. The place was probably beautiful in its day. The rooms just need refreshing. Be prepared for a musty smell when you arrive in the room. We had two rooms and both were the same. Overall believe it or not we had a great time. We did a lot of sight seeing to avoid the crowded kids pools and I do have to admit that dinners at the GW were very good. Breakfast buffet is fair and for the 5 of us each morning it was $125. Best restaurant was off property in Pai'a at Mama's Fish House. If you have small kids skip the road to Hana no matter what anyone tells you. The stops don't have \"parking\" and you're squeezed along a narrow road which wraps around and there are lots of winding turns. Luckily no one was sick but we had a few who were close to it. This is my first review. Hoped it wasn't so negative but I feel that when you make that trip you should have the cons and not just the beautiful website photos of the hotel.

They have GREAT waterslides, a water volcano, waterfalls, a pool-river that you can float along WITH rapids, a rope swing, and more. They even have a \"water elevator\" (which we did not try). We were there during the summer, so all of these attractions were quite packed with children (especially the water rapids slide, which was like a bowling alley of 9 year olds)-- but we 30-somethings managed to squeeze in and partake... It was fun! They also have one adult-only pool (which has a lot of adults lounging in it with Mai Tais)... so that one was pleasantly low-key... One thing I would say as a problem is the premium you have to pay for shade on the pool deck ($150 for the minimum two-chair accordion umbrella coverage, and goodness knows how much for a cabana). The sun is very hot and strong-- or at least it was when we were there in August. Down in the children's area, there are a few free thatch umbrellas (though people seemed to take the chairs under those quite early in the morning), but it's noisy down there-- not a super relaxing place to sit if you're a couple without kids. On the beach area you can rent an umbrella-- not sure how much that is, but I just think, if you are paying that much for a room, they shouldn't be so stingy with the shade. We have stayed at less expensive beach hotels elsewhere in the world (Mexico, Bermuda) where beach umbrellas were part of the deal... Anyway, we just stayed here one night, as we wanted to move around Maui and spend our days out touring and snorkeling, etc (if we are paying that much for a hotel, we didn't want to be out doing activities all day).

The breakfast buffet was excellent, but you just felt like you were being over charged. A light lunch at the Kula Cafe will cost you about $15-20 per person.

(Offsite, we found Ashley's for breakfast and lunch. About a 10 minute drive, the food was fantastic, the service friendly and the prices very reasonable. A little local place that did not disappoint. Excellent breakfast and one of the best cheese burgers around.) The final blow at the Grand was when I needed to print out my boarding passes at the business center. It cost me just over $21 to print them out. A service that most hotels will offer for free. Hint: Make sure that you enter the resort by the second entrance (marked Ballroom) so that you can go into the free parking lot. They don't tell you about that and the valet is $15 a day. There is also a daily $25 \"resort charge\" that we couldn't figure out what it was for. Even with the gouging going on, I would definitely go back because the rooms, the view, the location, the service and the facilities were great.

Also stayed at the Kei Lani next door on 2 occasions on previous trips. Prior to having our family, we'd stay in Kanapali at Hyatt, or condo's in the 80's. I'm saddened to see how ruined Lahaina has become with cheap tourist stores, hard rock cafe, etc.. There are 2 worlds on this part of Maui -- Wailea and Kehei. Kehei is for the economy traveler with a family. Nothing wrong with that. Staying at any of the 3 major Wailei hotels vs. any of the Kehei hotels is like -- well staying at the Plaza in NYC vs. Holiday Inn. When I travel I stay at H.I. but when I vacation I stay at the Plaza!. So I agree it's very expensive and they charge you for everything which is annoying. Staying in Kehei or Kannapali is more economical and come have a $12.00 cocktail at the lobby of the GW. :-) . Most come here w./ families for the pool system -- it is one of the worlds best as someone commented. Your children and you will have a blast. It's annoying to have to be in line at 7am when the pool opens to 'stake out' your 'free'(paid by the $25/day 'resort fee' they stick you with ... :-) ) lounge with 'free' shade. Yes, they charge $200 for tented cabanas, 50 for umbrellas, and 75 for 2 person lounge with top. So, come here but throw away the budget or you'll ruin your time for yourself and your family. All these 'extra' charges add up quickly -- smoothies (they are wonderful and you'll never be able to drink just one!!), $10-12 drinks, $15.00 hamburgers (but a very big and decent hamburger I would add).

After our return visit this time, this is still our very favorite hotel. Our kids did not want to go to Maui, if we could not return back to this hotel. So it is number one with our family. The food is very expensive for what you get. We had breakfast buffet in main dining room $125.00 per each morning. drinks are $12.00, mixed, we thought very well, though pricey. The Volcano Bar was expensive and the morning Caffe was also over the top. We ate at hotel a few meals and drinks and went off property during the day for dinner.

We also went knowing how extremely expensive Hawaii is. And its true, the location, grounds and pools at the Grand Wailea are fabulous, but I'm not sure I would be able to justify the $550 - $650 a night they charge if I was actually paying for a hotel room. The rooms are getting a little older and need a bit of rennovation. Wall paper is starting to peel from the walls and much of the grout in the tile in the bathroom has gone brown and black from use. The carpet often feels damp from humidity...I would suggest tile flooring rather than carpet. All in all, they need to update the place if they are going to continue to charge those prices. Food at the resort - as all resorts in Hawaii are are overpriced and not very good. We payed $12 for 2 lattes each morning, cocktails are $12 a pop - some strong, some very weak, and a burger costs $15. We ate offsite alot at Sensei Sushi, Cheeseburger Paradise, and Kehei Cafe. MUCH better food. I did appreciate the fact that children's food items at the resort are reasonable. $6-$10 per item, even at the higher end restaurants. The pools and beach are fantastic and is the biggest reason why I would return to the GW (on another free trip :o). They have water slides, roap swings, beach pools, volleyball, caves etc. and the kids were in heaven. But be prepared to get up at the crack of dawn and seek out your chairs right at 7am, or you will be left empty handed. There are too many people, not enough room for chairs and the staff do a lousy job of monitoring those people who show up at 7 to stake out a spot and then don't return until 2 in the afternoon. Also, there's also not alot of \"free\" shade. Shade costs you $200 a day for a cabana.

We played with our infant daughter in the pools, floated down the lazy river, had C-List celebrity sightings, rode the water elevator, and chatted it up with the other guests for a couple of days. On the other hand, the rim of the pool was extremely crowded. You need to get there early to claim a spot. The water elevator is one of a kind, but there are reasons for that. It takes a really long time to reset, and it really isn't all that exciting. The lazy river is on the short side. There really aren't nine different pools. The really big pool just has very distinct areas, some of which are passed off as separate pools. On the minorly annoying side, people accumulate wristbands as a status symbol to show how long they've been at the hotel. Maybe they keep them on because they have nothing to remove them with, and I was just bugged because I didn't get the chance to get more of them. Good water parks offer better water attractions, but the Grand Wailea is unique because it offers exceptional water attractions in the more mellow and sociable environs of a hotel pool. Yes, Discovery Cove in Orlando has a much better lazy river. On the other hand, I don't hang out, soak, and talk with strangers in water parks. Of course, the room was amazing. The bathroom was spectacular. My lanai had a little grassy patch, which was nice for my daughter. Service and food were all outstanding. Personally, I loved the Botelo sculptures in the lobby.

We reserved and paid $275.00 in advance for a cabana at the pool and had to spend the entire day policing the chairs that were included with the cabana because the hotel does not provide different towels to indicate that those are reserved chairs. When we asked for a different cabana location after our third day in the same one (we wanted a change of scenery), we were told that we could have that same cabana or none. The food was mediocre at best, and very expensive, although the wait staff at every place we ate was friendly and helpful. On the fourth day we sought the assistance of a manager for the smelly bedding and inability to get enough towels for each of us to have just one. The solution was to remove the feather bed and down comforter and leave us with a lightweight blanket and cheap mattress pad.

We literally walked the properties, asked questions of the respective staffs, etc. And while we chose the GW for the kids, we had meals at several locations (including three at the 4S). Notwithstanding a lot of the gloss in the other reviews on this site, there are vast differences between the GW and 4S. If you have children, the pools and water park at the GW are compelling. Two big slides (kids must be at least 46 inches tall to ride at all) and plenty of smaller pools and slides for others to try out. There is also a baby beach area, which is a sandy part of the pool that is just like a real beach, but without waves. It is a great place for little ones to be watched by their parents (and nannies), without some of the stress of playing on a beach with waves. Another plus of the GW is the grounds, which are sweeping (the property is huge). At least from where we were staying, one can look out over an expansive lawn to the beach. The 4S is on a bit more of a hill (maybe 30 to 40 feet), so the feel is more of being at an Italian resort overlooking the water (without the beach being immediately visible from most spots). Downsides of the GW: 1. The service can be impersonal. A valet drove over an inflatable tube that we had, leaving a tire imprint and (later, we found out) putting a leak in the tube. The bellman and valet just kind of shrugged. This would never happen at a 4S. 2. In rounding a corner en route to our room, the bellman clipped my daughter's boogey board on a corner, causing it to emit a cracking noise. He just looked at us and then ignored it. 3. Our room was fantastic and subpar. We were in 0016 (0010-0017 are all similar). Ocean view, ground level. We had a terrace a foot above a fish pond. It was fantastic for the kids to be able to throw bread in for the koi. It was a morning and evening ritual. Downsides are that the room was very musty / moldy and the carpet very dirty. Literally, we would get out of the tub or shower with clean feet and then our soles would get very dark just walking around the room. Would not happen at 4S. 4. Food is not just a notch, but two notches below the 4S and the prices are just about the same, with the GW higher in many cases (particularly for items from the children's menu). If you are a foody and decide to stay here, just have all of your meals over at the 4S. 5. The pools / water park are madness. Very loud and teeming with people, hundreds and hundreds of them. Screaming bands of kids. Kind of reminded me of that Mel Gibson movie, \"Mad Max\". This is okay if you have kids and are there for mayhem. But it is not relaxing, if that is what you are looking for. It is important to note that hotel staff can have birthday parties for their kids at the hotel, with tons of kids packed into normal hotel rooms for sleepovers and then invading the pool the next day. Another thing to consider is that the GW also sells admission to the pool to non-guests. $150 per week for adults and I did not check on the kids rate. So, as a result, some savvy folks who want a more refined atmosphere will stay at the 4S and then buy weekly passes for their kids to go next door and descend on the GW pool system. 6. The hotel is big and can get crowded. To get good chairs, I had to go down to the pooly by 7:00 a.m. each day, which wasn't that bad because we like to get an early start anyway. But it is something that one does not have to do at the smaller 4S. 7. My biggest problem with the GW is that, much like a cruise, it is designed to separate you from your money. Wailea is expensive, which is fine. I have no problem paying $40 or $50 per entree at the good restauarants, because that is the going rate. But I really hate being nickle and dimed by my hotel: a. Pool cabanas: 4 chairs under a cabana + 4 exterior chairs. One of the few ways to get shade. No real amenities. There are maybe 15 or so cabanas. The cost? $275 per day. That is not a typo. I was floored. So, I asked the question at the 4S, which had almost the same number but for a much smaller # of guests -- the answer was \"no charge.\" Needless to say, we didn't pay for this. Nor did we pay $175 for the use of a two-chair \"cassetta\" for the day. b. Their are two tiers of in-room internet access. The better option, which is the only one that will replicate what you are used to, is $15 per day. More nickle and diming. c. Printed a 75-page document at the business center. $1 per page. $75. Okay, so far. But then they were going to charge me $0.50 for a binder clip. d. It is actually more costly to have kids at the GW than at the 4S. For example, breakfast is free for < 5 guests at the 4S; not so at the GW. And the rest of the meals at the 4S for kids are far superior (and less costly) than at the GW. Also, the 4S puts out corn dogs and mac and cheese at the pool for kids -- again, at no cost. The ironic thing is that the rooms at the 4S are somewhat more expensive, but when you factor in all of the ways that the GW will separate you from your money (I have only listed a few), they must net out to be about the same. Finally, the atmosphere at the 4S is much more distinguished than at the GW. There is no comparison. The pool is much smaller (though still of a respectable size). It has a refined Italian resort feel to it, instead of a water park. In sum, I do not know why a couple would ever choose the GW over the 4S. For those with kids, the GW makes sense (with knowledge that you are consciously making some sacrifices), but just remember to have your meals over at the 4S (it is a short walk). Or alternatively, stay at the 4S and buy passes to the GW pool for your kids so that they can go run around somebody else's pool.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cCareful at the Grand Wailea Resort\u201d", "Author": "Michiganlovetotravel", "ReviewID": "UR8129981", "Content": "It has been a while since we were at the Grand Wailea, but the experience is one I should have shared earlier.

I had a worker tell me that there are more Caucasians in Maui than Hawaiians. For a few times during our stay I really had to remind myself where I was. There is no luau or type of Aloha spirit evident except from the lei greeting at check in or the telephone operators who always said \"Aloha\" and \"Mahalo.\" Interestingly enough there was a very large fireworks show (and it wasn't 4th of July) that was put on by one of the convention groups who were there. That certainly didn't remind me of Hawaii! On several occasions we passed employees who just walked by with their head down, not even smiling. Well, with that out of the way, here goes. We have stayed at this hotel before and knew what to expect. We had a garden view room which is very large by hotel standards. The king beds actually face the window. How intelligent is that?

We had a cabana for every day of our stay. Definitely cheaper than a sunburn. I laugh at people who complain about the cabana prices. There's always the chairs and umbrellas on the beach for I think $35 or something like that. Sit there if you don't want to spend the money for the cabana or stick a towel over your head - towels are complimentary, you can get as many as you want and you don't have to sign them out. I'm also amazed by people who complain about the breakfast. We went to Cafe Kula every day. My breakfast was hearty and never cost me over $11. The water park is amazing. The slides are great and the pool is always kept spotless. With 700 rooms it amazes me how they can keep all the pools and slides so neat and clean. Bottom line: if you want peace and quiet stay next door. If you want a place with a lot of fun, but quiet areas as well, then this is the hotel for you. Oh, we did have several problems with our air conditioning. Room never seemed to get really cold. Not sure about the negative reviews below. We didn't see those type of problems. Saw basic wear and tear, but that was about it.

The important thing to know about this hotel and Maui in general is that it is expensive. If you understand this going in, then you have no problem spending it. The beach itself is warm, and usually calm. There are no shells on this beach, however you can swim out a ways to snorkel. I highly recommend going to the beach in the morning and spending the afternoon at the pools when the ocean is a little more ruff.

This trip they put us in the worst room that we have ever stayed in at this hotel. We asked to have our room changed but they would not/could not do it. The room looked dirty- dirty grout around the tile, moldy picture frame in the bathroom, peeling wallpaper and a musty smell to the room. The room overlooked the parking lot and was not a garden view as described when we booked it. The hotel is also buiding residences across the street and this room received all the construction noise. It woke the kids up every morning. Even though the pool is great, it is hard to find a chair at the pool unless you are at the pool when it opens. Although this is a small thing, we do not like the stress of circling the pool waiting for someone to give up their chair so we can sit. This problem will likely get worst when the folks from residences across the street begin to use the property. It also seems that over the last several years the staff at the hotel have become less friendly and less trained. This resort was a great place- it fact the best we have ever been too.

What the Grand Wailea is: Very expensive, cannot be mentioned in the same sentence with Four Seasons, Ritz and JW's in service; mediocre in food and has the audacity to charge handsomely for shade at the pool. Why do we keep coming back? The resort itself is amazing. The pools are the highlight, the beach is one of the best anywhere, the offshore reef is an easy swim to see the sea turtles, and the artwork and gardens make you feel like you've found paradise. We were guests in 1991 when the resort opened and again shortly after the hotel was award 5 Diamonds so we are dissapointed that the hotel has becom indifferent to all the small things that differentiate a good resort from a great one. But let's face it, this place is fun, beautiful and if you are a business person who spends significant time away from the family, the GWR allows you to have fun together as a family and reconnect. To maximize your enjoyment of the resort you need to go in understanding that you won't have the personal service of the 4S, yes a drink will cost $13 at the pool and this is an activity based resort, lot's of kids and adults who are acting like kids. If you want quiet this is not the place for you. My last advice is eat offsite when you can. We had great meals at Joe's at the Wailea tennis club go at sunset and order the pumpkin seed coated Mahi. If you're in the mood for a steak, Ruth Chris is next door.

June 4, 2007 C. Richardson- Baltimore, Maryland My husband, daughter, son in law and myself stayed at the Grand Wailea from May 20-27 and I might add we had a wonderful time. After reading some of the other posts I was a little concerned about what I might find. I found the place to be very nice, yes it was a bit expensive but I had also prepared myself for that. This was my families first trip to Hawaii, I lived on Oahu when I was a child for about 2 1/2 years, needless to say it was quite different from what I recall. The Spa was the best ever and oddly enough I did not find the prices for this to be too far over the top comparing it to a cruise ship, we cruise quite often and all of the spas are owned by Steiners of London and the large difference I found was that there was no hard sell! Those of you who cruise no what I mean, no one was shoving over the top priced products in my face at the end, It was wonderful, my daughter & I were treated like royalty. I found the staff to be very friendly, our rooms were cleaned twice a day, all amenities replaced daily and they were very nice, the same as used in the spa. On the first night we had room service, my husband had a bowl of french onion soup, fries & a burger, we each had a coke and I had a turkey club with bacon and some fruit the total $63.00, including service fee and tip & tax. Now that was exspensive but..the portions as my daughter pointed out for everything we ate at the hotel was a very large serving, you make your own decision. The pools as you have heard were all great, a little crowded but we had no trouble getting a lounge chair. The learn to dive program is free which my husband got my son in law to do since he dives and he had a great time, the $99 fee to dive after the class was not too bad.We ate breakfast at the Buffet 3 times $27 per person, but I liked it very much I thought the view from the Lanai was lovely looking out onto the ocean, they could probably use some new furniture and if you don't keep your food close by you the birds will take it if you are seated outside! On the last day we went to the Sunday Brunch, this was the highlight of the day , very ,very lovely. More than enough food, prime rib to mahi mahi to spicey shrimp. I work in the industry and the presentation of this jazz brunch was very nice, I tried a new twist to a moomosa, guava & champagne, very nice! This set me back about $50 per person. All in all we enjoyed our stay on Maui and at the Grand Wailea , we will return next year. If you read enough reviews as I did there is a lot of good information out there I combed this site daily before we left, it was a great source. Try the Grand Wailea, yes she could use some updates but she is not outdated, I did not find (1) staff member who did not try to please, they were all very good and very friendly. Also I would like to add if you go to Maui you must see Ulalena, this show is exquisite!! A must see! Sometimes I wonder what some of us are looking for when we travel and go on vacation, do we leave human kindness at home because we have paid hard earned money to have a nice time, some of us nick pick at the littliest of things, don't get me wrong if there is a problem I would like to have it fixed as much as the next person but I will not forget that I am speaking to a human being, they are there to serve you they are not your servants, just a thought.

None of the water activities such as boogie boarding or snorkeling was free, there was a charge for everything that most hotels at this level include. A Hobie Cat was 55 per hour and boogie boards were 8 per hour. At the Wailea shops, you can rent a boogie board for 15 that covers a week's rental. My son had a blast with his and I liked the price! I agree the hotel is gorgeous and incredible as are the pools, but the sheer nickel and diming of everything little thing took the joy out of being there. I wouldn't go back there again, not at the prices they charge.

I think this is now the 3rd review I've written on this resort. I still have to laugh at some of the previous complaints on this resort. Well at least some people can stop harping on one thing......they repaired the tiles on the Hibiscus pool....not one out of place! Anyway on to the positives 1)The resort still looks tremendous. The grounds are the BEST in all of Hawaii, bar none. Beautiful and they keep the maintenence up as well, constantly wiping the brass rails, constantly pruning trees and bushes. I honestly have not seen any drop off since I first stayed there 8 years ago 2)We had a great room with a tremendous view. 3)Our bed was insanely comfortable. 4)Service was ALWAYS with a smile, be it from the bell men, to the valets, to the maids, to the landscapers. 5) Although I'm in my 30s, I can't get enough of the waterslides. Too much fun! 6) yes lots of kids at this resort but less so then at some other resorts I've been to in the Islands, and if you stay around the hibiscus pool, the screaming kids might as well have been on Mars because you don't see or hear them. 7)It's still insanely expensive. But this is Wailea. Any of the big resorts in this area are roughly the same price. You ARE going to spend a lot here. If you are budget-constrained for vacation, you probably should look elsewhere. We splurge once a year on vacation and we don't really care about the cost (within reason, of course!) 8)compared to it's 2 main competitors on the same stretch (Four Seasons and Fairmont) I would pick GW every time. The Four Seasons does trump GW in service (water spritzing, etc) but the grounds of the FS aren't even in the same league--not even close. Fairmont is also beautiful but again, aesthetically not on par with GW. In addition the adult area of GW is MUCH bigger, which at least to us was important. 9)The restaurants at GW are a notch below the FS's (and Fairmont's), but that was easily remedied by taking the short 5 minute beautiful walk on the beach to visit the other resorts. All 3 of these large Wailea resorts are unbelievable and pricey. You will not go wrong by choosing any of them. But pound for pound (and no, I'm not from the UK) GW is the best.

My room overlooked the wedding chapel and had an ocean view. I arrived to find I had been sent the fruit, cheese and wine gift from room service. It is fantastic and you will end up snacking on it for a couple of days. The rooms are huge. The bathrooms have both a large soaking tub and a stand alone shower. A bubble bath in their mango bathing gel is fantastic! All of the amenities are top notch. They smell incredible and the bottles are very generous. The terrace is roomy enough to invite a couple of friends over for pre-dinner cocktails. The beds, linens and towels are all fantastic and cozy. The sofa was equally as comfy and a great place for an afternoon nap. The internet was not wireless, but the connection was fast. The spa is not to be missed. Don't forget that any spa treatment also comes with standard \"spa extras\". Some of the extras include wonderful aromatherapy soaking tubs that are really relaxing. They also have different kinds of jacuzzi baths. They also give you a body scrub treatment complimentary. You want to arrive with plenty of time to try all of \"free extras\". After you finish all of your baths, etc. they invite you up a beautiful staircase. At the top of the staircase they spritz you with some delicious aromatherapy spray. It is a lovely touch and gives you an idea of the attention to detail you will find in the spa. They have a lovely terrace, overlooking the water where you wait for your treatments. This area is co-ed and a great place to meet up with someone before or after appointments. If you can score a treatment room on the oceanside...you won't be disappointed. I recommend the basic massage and facial. The pool area is lovely and can also get very crowded. The signature pool with the slides, etc. is obviously a magnet for families with children. If you are looking for a quiet place to sunbathe...you will probably opt for the grass area or the beach. There are plenty of lounge chairs and towels. I'm not really a fan of having to wear a bracelet to get a towel, but there is no choice. Plus, the kids seem to enjoy collecting their wristbands in different colors each day they are at the hotel. The slides and the lazy river are fun. You won't want to miss a trip to the pool bar in the cavern. It is worth a swim over there for a \"Chi-Chi\"---a \"Chi Chi is a vodka version of a Pina Colada...and my new favorite drink. :) Room service was quick and the prices are as high as you would expect. It is worth the expense to have the pancakes with coconut syrup. The Spago at the Four Seasons is a lovely restaurant. You will want to be sure to get a table outside. For a reasonably priced meal that is DELICIOUS...try Joe's Bar and Grill. It is a friendly place with terrific food and it is about 4 minutes from the hotel. It is a good place for two people to sit at the bar. There are a million things you could say about this resort. It is beautiful. It has everything you could ever need. The service is fantastic. The location is fantastic. It is worth the flight and the expense.

Where to start? We had never been to Hawaii before but found an opening in our calendars and decided to take a trip (at our Travel Agent's Advise) to the Grand Wailea - Maui. We were not disappointed. The Grand Wailea is indeed GRAND. Before diving headlong into my review, I would like to comment that what I remember most about the Grand Wailea are two things: 1. How genuinely friendly all the people who work there are and 2. How professional the service is. I have read dozens of Trip Advisor Reviews and have learned that good and bad experiences hinge on two key components; 1. Service -and- 2. Hospitality. The Staff at the Grand Wailea get extremely high marks from me in both categories. First, a sampling of the level of service the Grand Wailea provides from end to end; -THE VALET AND BELL STAFF are friendly and don't monkey around. I don't think we waited more than a minute when we drove up to the grounds before we were greeted by the Valet person. They are as efficient as they are pleasant, and they are over-staffed. What a pleasant surprise. EXCELLENT. -The FRONT DESK staff are all professionals. There are no waiting lines. This is a customer-focused shop. They are all tastefully dressed and very composed. These folks set a fabulous tone on behalf of their property. EXCELLENT. -CONCIERGE SERVICES. Like their aforementioned colleagues, the Concierge Staff are outstanding. First, The Grand Wailea does not offer the all-too-familiar and painfully understaffed Concierge \"Desk\" that is hidden somewhere on the premises and is too often staffed by a polite but uniformed young person who seems completely out of place and can offer no help. The Concierge DEPARTMENT at the Grand Wailea is a team of professionals who are well schooled at their craft and endlessly helpful and courteous. They are prepared to handle a wide range of requests and all seem quite comfortable in their roles. As an example, I plopped down at one of their stations on one day and explained to the Concierge that I would like to do some Sport Fishing. The sage gentleman behind the desk interviewed me to learn in detail what would make for a memorable fishing excursion for me (it was my birthday present from my wife) and in no time had me hooked in (get it?) with a Captain and Vessel that best suited both my needs and my personality. That's what I'm talking about. Yes, I got seasick as did my poor non-fishing wife but I did manage to land a very solid Mahi Mahi and we got to get up close and personal with a tandem of Mother and Calf Humpback Whales. For a knucklehead from the mainland, that was AWESOME! EXCELLENT THE ROOM was located in the NAPUA SUITES a gated (private) tower adjacent to the main hotel. Something about a gate and FREE Breakfast and Happy Hour always makes me feel like I have gotten my evens with the hotel. The guilt I felt as I loaded up my Happy Hour plate with Rumaki's and Mini Quiches really felt decadent! Just kidding. It was great to have free breakfast every morning with piping hot Starbucks Coffee, Fresh Fruit and omelets. The evening fare (Happy Hour) was not quite as scintillating but (naturally) it is hard to beat FREE. VERY GOOD The room in the Napua Suites was very, very nice. It seems like one of the key barometers for measuring the quality of the room is whether the carpets are worn and/or soiled. I am happy to say that our carpet was new and smelled great! The balcony is spacious and the furniture is top of the line. No Wal Mart stuff in this place. I won't even talk about the view. Suffice to say that it is like being in a postcard. The view of the property and the ocean is absolutely breathtaking. I mean, gorgeous. Beware of poaching birds when you have your breakfast on the balcony. Their kamakazee skills are well honed and their sense of entitlement to your left overs is not open for debate. Bring your food tray/s in your room when you are finished or you will have bird dew all over your outdoor furniture. EXCELLENT The bed (while elegant) was the only disappointment. I don't know if two eight hundred pound people slept in it before us but the mattress was pretty bogus. It was really riding low in our two sleeping \"valleys\" and was very high in the middle. The Grand Wailea fails in this department. If you have a fickle lower back and/or you like a firm mattress - you'd better bring lots of Advil. Even the addition of two pieces of plywood under our mattress did not improve the condition of the mattress. NOT EXCELLENT The room is spacious and the appointments (art, furniture, lighting...) are all extremely tasteful and soothing. More importantly, the couch and matching chair are genuinely comfortable, another sure sign of a top notch hotel. The room was also outfitted with a 32\" Flat Panel HDTV which made me feel right at home. High Speed Internet Access is FREE and their data pipe is BIG. I was surfing the internet at 2 and 3 mb with no interruption of service. I might also add that my Sprint wireless data card (for my laptop) worked wonderfully (and wirelessly) from my perch on the balcony. BIG BONUS for you business types (like me) who need connectivity. EXCELLENT The Bathroom (I am being serious) is the highlight of the suite. It is gigantic and is absolutely heavenly. It boasts a luxurious oversized tub with jacuzzi jets and a separate shower with one of those shower heads that make you feel like you are standing in the rain. The water pressure (another sign of a great property) is outstanding. When you put the shower head on the massage setting you will really relax. This feature surely saved me a grand in massage services at the Spa and enabled me to overlook the lameness of the spent mattress. The oversized vanity area with double bowl sinks and tons of mirrors is a woman's dream. One warning: Watch out for opening and actually using any of the native toiletries in the baskets. They aren't free. I opened a bottle of hydrating botanical rose hip moisturizer and learned (too late) that it was FOR SALE. EXCELLENT Room Service does a very efficient job, which is rare for such a large resort. While I can't recommend any of their specialties, I will say that their $100 Bacon Cheeseburger with French Fries is delicious. Just kidding. It was probably $15 US. The key to Room Service is speed and The Grand Wailea (thanks again to solid management and sound quality control) delivers, literally. The food was always on time and the wait staff was courteous, professional and HONEST! No double tipping in this joint! They let you know each and every time that an 18% gratuity has already been added and that all one needs to do is sign the receipt. I can't count the number of times where I have been tricked by unscrupulous, unprincipled Room Service servers (in lesser hotels) who have wantonly baited me into over-tipping them. In fact, I am full of rage and bitterness over this. Maybe I need some counseling or a Hospitality Anger Management (HAM) class or something, I don't know... VERY GOOD The Pool and Beach are to faint over. There are an over-abundance of COMFORTABLE pool chaises and chairs for all. No need to set the alarm for 6AM to reserve your favorite spot or put in dibs for a coveted cabana. Just Hang Loose and enjoy. We particularly liked the expertly manicured lawn that stretches for quite a distance from the Adult Pool to the beach. This is a great place to catch ray, enjoy the service of the pool wait staff, and take a refreshing dip in the not-too-crowded pool as the need arises. Again, no pressure and no overpopulation. Just pure relaxation in paradise. The other thing we enjoyed was the perfect weather. Maui was in the low to mid eighties every day and always featured a cool and pleasant breeze. By contrast, a trip to Florida in April is akin to making a date with Hades. The extreme, burning heat and stifling humidity make a trip to Florida in summer seem more like competing in a Triathalon. Maui's soft sands and gorgeous emerald-blue waters and mesmerizing mountains are absolutely king in my book. As everyone else advises, make sure you have the Sunscreen ready for action. The sun is so intense that the drive in our Hertz convertible Mustang (A Lemon) without sunscreen was an early vacation miscue. Definitely have the sunscreen applied before heading from the Airport/Car Rental place to the Grand Wailea and try to get a Seabring Convertible. Much nicer. The scenery is so breathtaking (atop the mountains and overlooking the ocean) that you will want to make sure you have an unobstructed view of the amazing panorama that is Maui. The Convertible is key. The flight from St. Louis to Maui was long but United Airlines does an excellent job. Their staff are really friendly and an upgrade from Economy to Economy Plus ($89/person at the Gate) was worth every dime for the additional nine inches of leg room. Add a good pair of Bose Headphones or a DVD or two to the mix, topped off with an Ambien and you are as good as gold. The Bottom Line: We spent $10k for ten days in Maui. That's a grand a day for two people. Was it worth it? Every dime. If you are looking to spoil yourself and to chill out in a very, very nice resort - you will not be disappointed. If you are wanting to see Hawaii on a budget, I would not recommend this avenue. But, why fly all the way to paradise and then get bent out of shape over nickels and dimes, anyway? Did I mention that we ran into John Corbett, the star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding? My wife was glowing. He was well disguised in a bucket hat and oversized, mirrored Ray Ban's but the MRS still found him out. If only I had such magnetism! Oh well, at least I found the Grand Wailea. :) Mahalo.........................", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cGrand Wailea was wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "anne2mark", "ReviewID": "UR7588638", "Content": "My hsband and I just returned from a week long stay at the Grand Wailea. We were celebrating our 12 year anniversary and chose the GW based on the glowing revies of 2 good friends. We were not disappointed! Yes, there are lots of kids but not as many as other times of the year. May is a great time to go for that reason. We have 2 children (who we left at home) but found that it did not bother us to have other people's kids around- we did not have to take care of them! :) The grounds and hotel are just beautiful- so lush and over the top. While the Four Seasons is nice if you want peace and quite, we liked the variety that GW had to offer. You could go for quiet at the adult pool or more action at the activity pool. We actually chose to hang out at the activity pool more often, even without the kids. It was not overrun by any means. Very relaxing. The beach area is really nice as well. Of course, it is true that everything is very expensive. At the end of the trip you are sort of numb to the fact that in Maui breakfasts are $50 and dinners can be $250+. You can go cheaper, I am sure. However, this was a once in a blue moon trip for us so we decided to indulge and live like \"rock stars\"! The staff were all friendly and helpful.

We are 25yrs old, but we enjoy laid back get aways - we arent much for bar hopping in Lahaina. Anyway, we booked a Terrace Room and were upgraded to the Garden View upon arrival (with no request). I was amazed at the view! I read on here before we booked that most rooms were the same, except for suites, the only thing different was the view. Since we were planning on spending most of our time at the beach/pool, I didnt think an incredible view was worth the extra hundreds of dollars/night. When we checked into the garden view I was so pleased with the Lanai and the beautiful gardens! Sure, it wasnt the ocean or the mountains, but the trees and flowers were beautiful! We arent much for hanging out on the Lanai anyway, so we still only sat out there a couple times. The room was great - very large. It had a couch and a kind size bed. The decorations were \"island elegant\". The bathroom was wonderful - a big tub and glass shower. The vanity area was large also. I read horrible reviews on here about the rooms being dirty and aged, but I didnt feel that way at all. Everytime we opened the door, we got a fresh whif of tropical soapy scents (sounds wierd, but it was really nice). I could tell the carpet was a little dingy and some tiles/grout in the bathroom was aged or cracked, but I didnt think it took away from the room a lot. The staff were incredible. I read bad things on here about the staff, but we had the opposite experience. Everyone we passed said Aloha and briefly spoke with us about our day. When we were leaving we got a few \"see you next years\" which made us feel so welcome (of course we are paying big money for it...). The lei upon arrival was nice as well. We valet parked the first day, so we didn't have to worry about finding the lobby or the parking garage. The bellman that showed us to our room was also exceptional - he told us all about the resort. What times things were open, what to expect where, etc. When we checked in we got a couple maps of the resort as well. We were in the front wing near the center Grand Dining room on the Molokai parking garage side. The parking garage wasnt as convenient as valet parking, but it sure wasnt as far from our room as other reviews make it sound. It was definitely worth saving the $15/day plus tip! PLus it was a very pretty walk! We didnt have trouble finding it at all - the garages are on both sids of the main entrance and are labeled either molokai garage or Kiehi garage I believe. The resort has SO much to offer and looking at the map online it is kind of overwhelming, but i was amazed at how it didnt feel too big. We spent about an even amount of time at the adult pool, the beach, and the activity pool. The slides/lazy river/rapids are fun for adults too! We never had a problem getting beach chairs - at any time during hte day - but I know we werent there during the peak of the summer. I could see where it may be a problem then. The chairs are nice at the pool, with cushions on them. We didnt rent a cabana or anything because we were there for the sun! we just put on a lot of sunscreen and were fine! The views all over the resort are just amazing though. The pictures dont even do it justice. We went over to the Four Seasons one day and it just didnt compare. The pool was nice and elegant, but it just wasnt as big - with a large resort like these, I'd like the big pool and beach area for all the people. Not to mention, there were no slides, etc. I didnt notice any kids at the Four Seasons, so maybe thats the difference, but kids werent a problem for us at the GW. If they get annoying, you can go to the adult pool. We ate at the Grand Dining Room for breakfast one morning and it was delicious. The view was amazing, but of course the price was high also. I would never pay the $27/person for the buffet - I just couldnt eat my money's worth. Instead I just ordered regular pancakes for $13 and my husband had an egg, hashbrown, toast, sausage combo for $16. That was still real expensive for what we are used to, but definitely much cheaper than the buffet. I think when eating on the resort, you can either accept the high prices, make wise choices when ordering (if a bagel is too expensive then dont get the bagel! there are reasonable items on the menu), or you can eat off the property. We had the Maui Revealed book and ate at several places we found highly rated in there - that were cheaper - and we loved them. We also ate at the Volcano Bar, Bistro Molokini, and Cafe Kula. All were decent, nothing spectacular for the price, but you are paying for the convenience of eating on the resort I think. For us, we ate about half on the resort and half off. Drinks at the resort are high also - $12 for pretty much any alcohol drink. We knew that going in, so just budgeted for it and had fun. They are going to be expensive at any resorts. Even at the government resort on Oahu has $8 drinks I think. Drinks at the restaurants off the resort were cheaper - but hey a few more dollars for a drink in the pool was worth it - just not for a ton of drinks. We did the scuba lesson and dive also and absolutely loved it. Donald was our dive instructor. The dive was off the shore - so nothing too scary, but we saw lots of colorful fish, reef, turtles, and eels. People were also snorkeling out above where we were also. Donald took a ton of pictures underwater of us. It was $50 for the pictures, but the 80 shots are priceless! He was an incredible instructor and dive guide. I would request him for sure! Of course the others may be great also... There is also a cove in front of the Marriott Wailea (which isnt a beach front resort by the way - its a rocky cove). This cove had 4 or 5 turtles swimming in it. We walked over and took pictures - it was great! We did a couples massage at the Grand Spa also. This is hands down the best spa I've been too - and I am a frequent Spa goer at home and on vacation. We got to our Terme appt about 30 minutes early, and they just let us go in. So we got an hour and a half in the baths and then a 50 minute massage. Between the 2 we sat outside on the spa lanai in our robes for about 10 minutes. It was gorgeous - overlooking the adult pool and ocean! My husband isnt much for baths, as I'm sure most guys arent, but he loved the terme!! He may have enjoyed those more than the massage! The massage was great though - in a couples room - with hawaiian spa music and the windows open, so we could hear the ocean. Just perfect! One last thing I would reccommend is the Warren and Annabelle show in Lahaina. It was a close second to our scuba dive at GW for our favorite on the trip. Its a magic/comedy dinner show thats incredible!! We went to the Luau at the Marriott Wailea. It was ok - the food was pretty good and the dancing/costumes/fire thrower was good. Kinda cheesy though, but I think a lot of the luau's are like that I guess. Overall, I cant wait to go back to Maui. We will definitely stay at the Grand Wailea again. Its a perfect mix of adult relaxing atmosphere plus fun - all in luxury! Yes its very expensive, but if you know that going in and can afford it, just accept it and have fun. In comparison to the other resorts on Maui - its worth the money!!

The rooms are very nice, well appointed, and large by hotel standards, especially the bathroom which has both tub and shower. Beds are very comfortable and the lanai gives you a great view. There is a mini bar instead of a refrigerator which was too bad but other than that everything was great. Plan on doing a lot of walking here even the self parking garage is quite a hike every day. We had breakfast in the Grand Dining room twice while there both times the food was superb, don't miss the Whole wheat cranberry pancakes! Lunch by the pool was also a great treat as was dinner at the Bistro one night. The small Cafe for breakfast was not the greatest but a good cup of coffee and bagel worked fine along with some fresh fruit. The pools are amazing, several levels of water fun all interconnected by slides my husband had a great time! The beach is lovely and chaise lounges are provided but shade will cost you 45.00 a day for an umbrella, just a little pricey. Thankfully there is an independent service just down the beach that will provide one for 20.00! There is no direct access to the Shops at Wailea which is a shame but the blue cheese burgers at the Burger place are worth the walk. There is also a coffee place tucked away upstairs that makes a great cup of coffee! Not to be missed is Roy's Restaurant for dinner, it is located in the Safeway shopping center on Pilani Highway.

The Grand Wailea is a huge property with beautifully maintained grounds. We used our Hilton Honor points and stayed here 5 days. If we had paid for this hotel, we would have been very disappointed and felt very taken advantage of. We are not cheap people. We stayed here to celebrate our anniversary and to \"treat\" ourselves. We were prepared for the high prices in Hawaii and the higher costs associated with luxury hotels. The Grand Wailea far exceeeded our expectations by outrageously charging for every little thing and for services that are usually complimentary at other hotels. Its funny how that works when you get more and pay less at mid-priced hotels like Hiltons and Holiday Inns. At luxury hotels like the Grand Wailea you are charged a lot more and then charged even more for the things that are free at the lower end hotels. This is the only hotel that I have ever heard of that you can't pull your car up to the front door and check in and then go park your car. The main entrance is \"valet only\" and there is no parking. The self parking garage is next to the property and is unmarked. I feel they purposely trick the guest into using valet parking, especially during the check in process and give you no other option. We unknowing pulled into the main entrance and tried parking the car when we arrived to check in. We were promptly notified by valet that there was no parking and they would be happy to park the car. After checking in, my husband asked if parking was included in the price of the room. The front desk told him valet was $15/day and the self park garage was free. My husband complained that he was not offered this option and that this was the only hotel he has stayed at that you can't park in front and check in. The front desk called the valet and told them not to park our car. We ended up parking the car ourselves after check-in. The self parking garage is quite a walk from most of the hotel rooms. They make the guest feel like valet parking is your only option by not offering and not identifying the self parking garage. The hotel sits on 43 acres so there is a chance you wil have a good walk. This could be a problem for someone with a physical disability or families with small children. We were notified upon check-in that we were upgraded to a \"oceanview\" room which would have cost $950 night. We were expecting the room to look like the Taj Mahal at that price tag. It was your average hotel room on ground level that overlooked a Koi pond, wedding chapel, manicured lawns, and then the ocean. It was as close to the ocean as any of the rooms were but nothing else was special about this room. The condition of the rooms were slightly used and outdated. You could see the age by the tiles and grout in the bathroom, old bathroom rugs and stained tiles on the lanai. The bed was big and comfy with clean white linens. Our room came with a mini-bar refridgerator but you were asked not to store any personal items in the refridgerator to avoid getting charged for any of their provided items. Expecting outrageous prices for the provided items in the mini-bar, the Grand Wailea far exceeded this expectation. They also say they provide free internet. You must plug your computer into their dock and it is very very slow connection. If you want a faster connection, you must call the front desk and pay an extra $5/day. You would still have to use the same connecting dock, the only difference would be they would flip a switch somewhere and give you the faster service and charge you more. Our first morning, we woke up and decided to check out breakfast in the main dining room. At $27 per person for your basic breakfast, eggs, meat, bread and potatos, this just seemed outrageous. We drove down the road to Kihei and ate every morning at a small cafe called Ashleys where the prices were reasonable and the food was fast and delicious. We looked at the room service menu which was identical to the dining room menu except for the 18% service charge plus $4 delivery fee on top of the outrageous menu prices. A bowel of oatmeal and a bagel only would have cost $30! We did purchase food once at the hotel from Cafe Kula because we were in a hurry to catch our tour. Cost of 1 Coolah energy drink: $7.03. Cost of cup of yogurt with granola on top $6. I thought maybe energy drinks would cost a little more considering they are imported from the mainland and I found the prices to be the exact same at most gas stations and shops. After a short time, you began not to trust this hotel. For services that are standard at every other hotel, the Grand Wailea charges and they charge a lot more. To use the hotel pools, you must get a wrist band and they offer towels. I though for sure this was another way for the Grand Wailea to charge their customers but this is one service that is still complimentary. Overall, the staff seemed very friendly except when my husband called the front desk to ask if they were having problems with the internet. Instead of checking on it for him, they automatically connected him with their internet provider. The Grand Wailea is known for their pools. The pools are beautiful. We stuck by the adult only Hibiscus pool and had a little trouble finding 2 chairs. There were Cabanas but you had to reserve and pay for those. It seemed like the pool area lacked attention as there were used wet towels and empty drinks everywhere. I only noticed 2 waiters taking drink orders for the entire area. There were probably more empty chairs than it seemed but you couldn't tell who was there and who had left because there was a towel on every chair. The other pools were crawling with children and were very busy. I could see lots of fun things like water slides but I didn't feel like hanging out with 10 year olds. This is also one of those hotels that charge an additional $25 day on top of the room rate and tax for a \"resort fee.\" As if they already haven't drained your life savings after a stay here, they dare to add insult to injury by sneaking in this fee on your bill. Overall, this place was nice. The rooms on their website look like they are right on the ocean, and they are not. In truth, the hotel sits far behind the water and in our opinion, the pictures are deceiving. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is overall very friendly. The prices here are outrageous for what you get, even by Hawaii hotel standards. If we hadn't used Hilton Honor points we would have felt very cheated and ripped off. The rooms are needing some updating very soon. We will not stay here again. This hotel would be ok for someone who is not actually paying for their stay here or if you like wasting your hard earned money.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat honeymoon location, beautiful scenery, very remote\u201d", "Author": "AMRBoston", "ReviewID": "UR7479864", "Content": "I'm about to celebrate my 2 year anniversary, and I got to thinking about my honeymoon at the Grand Wailea. Atfer a week in Oahu, my husband and I took a puddle jumper to Maui. My first impression of Maui was shock. I was expecting lush greenery and tropical utopia, but was greeted with a gigantic walmart, strip mall, and an otherwise overly commercial area. After a few minutes in the car we got our scenery. It's amazing. More, the Grand Wailea is one of the most beautiful places I've ever experienced. Not seen, experienced. There are fountains, pools, restaurants, flowers, the beach, just amazing... It's very remote, about 40 minutes from Lahaina, which was were the nightlife was. The restaurants were fair considering the price. $25 pizzas are not really appealing. My husband was reprimanded for not being dressy enough in the resort lobby, I guess he was to wear collared shirts in the public areas, and not a t-shirt? There are people paid to hose down the sand on the beach full time as it's very windy. Tons of kids. Holy cow were there a ton of unattended kids. The spa? WOW. The terme, hot baths, couples massage and bath, papmering, etc. have no equal. All in all, we had a good time. The grounds and ammenities were 5 star. The costs, rules, and staff were not. I'd love to go back some time, but wouldn't want to be there more than a few days. It would be ideal to stay in Lahaina and just spend a few hours at the resort spa, if they allow that...", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntsville, AL", "Title": "\u201cNice resort, but glad it was on the company's dollar\u201d", "Author": "drydenh", "ReviewID": "UR7474261", "Content": "First of all - WOW - the town of Wailea is fantastic. You can tell that it is the rich part of Maui. On the drive from the airport you will notice the typical crowded and unkempt yards of a beach town, dusty & sandy paths, and worn down houses. But once you come into Wailea it's a different story. Well manicured lawns, new & large homes, beautiful vegitation and many fancy resorts & shops. The Grand Wailea is definately a 5 Star resort, but you can see signs of aging in the rooms. The most notable was the tile work in the bathroom. Originally white or beige grout was dingy from time. I noticed one review commented on dirty tiles on the lanai, but it's outside at the beach, what do you expect? Neither of these \"complaints\" should be a reason to overlook the Grand Wailea. The bed was heavenly - all white down pillowtop, down comforter, & oversized down pillows. The room was very spacious and our view overlooking the pools & out to the beach was spectacular. We were on the top floor, second to the end of the lagoon wing (I think - it was room 3068). The hotel provides towels for the pool/beach and chairs. (I went during April, which is the off-season, but I didn't have a hard time finding a chair and nobody was at the pool before 8:00 am. This is probably not true during peak season though, because as the day wore on, the pool became much more crowded.) If you can't find a chair at the pool, it is most likely because people have left their used towels on the chairs that they have vacated. Look around for chairs that have only towels and no shoes, clothes, bags, etc. with them and they are 90% open. Just throw the towels to the side. You aren't supposed to be able to \"save\" chairs for longer than 60 minutes even with your stuff on them, but the pool attendants don't start picking up left towles until the late afternoon. Also, is all else fails, look around at the more hidden areas of the pools - next to the slides and such - where most people don't go for chairs. Or drag one of the beach chairs upto the lawn. The adult pool is the most crowded of all the pools in the way of chairs because the adults tan instead of swim. Oh, if you need towles after the activity desk closes, I think you can request them from the front desk and they will bring them to you. I think. I also noticed complaints about rude staff members. Everyone that I walked past greeted me with an \"aloha\" and were very friendly. The only people that weren't helpful were the valet (it is $15/night to valet park & free to self park - but it's a walk - so the valet kinda look down on you if you self park.) My husband rented a longboard and wanted to store it. The bellmen said that it was too large for their storage, but the valet could store it with the bicycles. The valet said he would take care of it when he parked our car. When he found out we were self parking he turned up his nose and told him to take it to the bell desk. After explaining what the bell desk said he finaly said that he \"guess\"ed he could take it if he had to. My husband just ended up taking it up the stairs and keeping it in our room instead. So if you intend on valet parking, you should have no problem. If you want to self park, just try to aviod the valet all together. The front desk was helpful. When we were ready to check out I noticed that we had been charged $25 every day instead of once for the refrigerator that we had brought to our room. When we called about it, she immediately removed the extra charges. (But do check your bill - what if they did that every time? Not everybody would notice or say something about it.) Do realize that the room rate is not all you will pay. There is a $20 per night charge for a resort fee (that is supposed to be fore internet, phone calls, pool access, self parking, etc.), $3 per night housekeeping fee, $15 per night valet parking fee (or self parking is free), $25 one time charge if you want a refrigerator, crazy prices for umbrellas at the beach or cabanas at the pool that I didn't even want to know, high prices for watersport equipment at the beach, a charge for floats/innertubes at the pool, and probably more that I'm forgetting. And all that has the 11.XX tax added to it. Many guest commented that they felt \"nickle and dimed\" at this resort because of all the extra fees. But look on the bright side - you don't have to pay for what you don't want. Except that resort fee and housekeeping fee. The pools were great. The Hibiscus pool is 18 & up only, so it is relaxing (if there aren't a buch of drunk people in it). The water elevator is overrated, but I'm sure the kids will love it. The 2 big slides are fantastic - even for adults - very fast and long. The rope swing was a huge hit with the kids. The cascading slides, especially the rapid slide are fun leading into the lazy river. They also offer each guest one free complimentary introductory scuba lesson in the deep water pool. Then you can go on an ocean dive out in front of the hotel for $99. (Certified divers are charged $25 for a refresher lesson, but it is subtracted from the ocean dive fee, so it is still only $99 if you go on the dive.) The dive is simple, nothing fantastic, but it is nice for a first time dive. You should at least take the lesson. There's no commitment to go on the dive if you don't want to. It was way easier than snorkling because it was so much easier to breathe and you don't have to worry about sucking in water. When we went it was only my husband (who is a certified diver) and I so, the instructor was able to watch me and help me continuously. Even in a group, the numbers are limited, so you should have a similar experience. They also take high quality digital pictures of you during the dive that they will sell to you for $50 on a CD. The grounds were beautiful. Well maintained and tiki torches burned all over the resort at night. Art and water are displayed beautifully all over the hotel and grounds. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants at the resort because they were soooo expensive and no one I talked to (or reviews I read) said that they were very good, just O.K. We also didn't have any spa treatments, but I heard rave reviews about them from other guests, especially the hydrotherapy that you experience before your treatment. My husband played the Wailea Emerald Golf Course. He loved it. He said the views were great. I probably wouldn't spend my own cash at the regular rates here just because of all the extras that you have to pay for. But it was a wonderful experience. I'm just glad that my husband's company rewards his hard work with places like these every year! For those of you who aren't concerned about the amount you pay, the Grand Wailea is a good place to go, especially if you have kids (because of the pools and child-sitting services). I did hear another guest say that the Four Seasons next door was wonderful. It was more expensive, but they included much more in their rates, instead of charging you separately for everything. Other Info: We ate at: 1. Lahina Fish Company in Lahina (Moderate to Slightly High, approx. $18 - 39/entree), good food, O.K. service, great view - it sits out over Lahina Harbor). 2. Paia Fish Market in Paia (Inexpensive, approx $10-13/entree), great fried food, counter service only, a few bench style tables that you sit with other people at, no view). 3. Buzz's Warf at Maalea Harbor (Slightly High, approx. $23-45/entree & drinks are club service - no refills), FANTASTIC shrimp - read up about it - O.K. other food, O.K. service, O.K. view of Maalea Harbor, but not directly on the water, so you'd have to sit at the window and look over the parking lot. 4. Canoes in Lahina (Moderate to Slightly High, approx. $18-39/entree) O.K. food - I didn't really care for my Mahi, good service, good view of the ocean if you sit at the windows near the north end of the restaurant. We shopped at: 1. The Shops at Wailea - really only good for high-end shopping, not much entertainment. Only a couple of restaruants.2. Front Street in Lahina - nice to stroll & do some Hawaiian market shopping along with a few clothing stores, nice jewelry stores, and art galleries. Lots of restaurants. Stop and check out the huge Banyan tree. 3. Whaler's Village in Kanapali - similar to the shops at Wailea, but on certain nights they offer free entertainment. 4. Hagusegawa (sp?) General Store in Hana - junky place to pick up a t-shirt or a snack or some motor oil after traversing the road to Hana. 5. ABC store - the ultimate Hawaiian convience store. Good for cheap souveniers, snacks, etc. We surfed at \"The Cove\" in Kihei. Good, long breaking 1 foot swells for beginners. It is where a lot of surf classes take place, but you can keep away from them by surfing in the actual cove where commercial activity is forbidden. We rented our board from Maui Waveriders which has a shop out of a truck between the Marketplace and the 76 Gas station near the Cove in Kihei and somewhere in Lahina. They were great. Provided you with booties - the sand can be dangerous from rocks - a rash guard - and of course the board. A soft top is $15/day and a hard top is $30/day. We traveled the Road to Hana. If you like seeing a lot of different areas/beaches and waterfalls, you should do this, ONCE. But it is a loooong winding road. There are lots of places to stop to swim, body board, and see waterfalls. You can even swim in some waterfalls, but it's not always advised depending on the conditions. We went to Big Beach in Makena - this is more like the beaches you'd be used to in the US. Most beaches in Hawaii are small, but this golden sand beach is long and wide. The shore break is right on the beach, so bodyboarding and body surfing are fun, but dangerous. The waves have some major crashing force here. The water here is crystal clear.

As soon as our taxi from the airport arrived at the hotel the bellhop happly opened the door and gave us leis and offered to take our bags, aftering accepting there offer they directed us to the check in desk. The line was rather long but it went rather quickly. After receiving our room keys the same bellhop that assisted us upon arrival showed us to our rooms and asked if there was anything else we needed. After he left we toured our room which was actually very nice, but deffinatlly not worth the $700 price tag. The bathroom was very nice and very clean, but in other parts of the room there were defiant signs of aging as you could see wood chips missing from the closet door and from the bathroom door. But overall the only thing that really I disliked was the fact that there was a stain on one of our pillows that looked of blood. Emidiately we called house keeping who showed up very shortly (withing 10 minutes) and genuanly apologised for the inconvenience. After looking at our room we toured the property and decided to try and go for a swim aftering getting into our swimsuits and going down to the pool it was shocking to find out that towels were not being given out beyond six even though the pool was open till 10:00.

On our first day we went to the pool at about 10 AM and found the pools to be absolutley amazing, but at the same time very crowded with other familys.

On our last day at the Grand Wailea we came out to the pool at noon and to our amazment the horror stories were true no chairs were avaliable, but and excellent pool staff member gladly helped up out by finding us two chairs.

Those two days were the absolute most incredible, and luxurious days of our entire 3 week stay in Hawaii! Because we were on our honeymoon they upgraded us to the Napu Tower!! OMG!!! I've never stayed in finer accomodations. I have no idea what the cost of that room was, but I know I would never be able to afford it on my own. The night before our wedding we had gone to the Old Lahaina Luau in Lahaina with family (sort of a \"rehearsal\" dinner.) By the time we got back to South Maui and checked into the Grand Wailea we were exhausted. After we saw our accomodations we were stoked and instantly rejuvenated. We quickly unpacked and went down to the Botero Bar and just took in the lush surroundings. This place has the most incredible feast for your senses! You have to experience it to believe it!! We were like teenagers, so giddy with anticipation and excitement. After several rounds of drinks and a walk through the grounds we finally went back to our room. The most incredible bed and views I have EVER seen!!! I can't remember a time I slept so well. The next morning we had fabulous room service for breakfast and ate it on our large lanai. I didn't want to leave...it was such an incredible view and such a serene moment! I savored every second!! We finally went downstairs to meet the kids and spend some time at the pool. Again....WOW!!! That was definitely the highlight of our trip for me. Call me a kid at heart but I didn't want to leave at 2pm to go get ready for my own wedding! I had waited for that day for 10 years (that's how long we had been together...) and all I wanted to do was stay at the pool, order cocktails & poolside snacks, visit the swim up \"grotto\" bar, and play on the slides all day! The next day we were able to take advantage of the pool again since we were still hotel guests until we checked out. Which believe me...we all took advantage of until the last second! We all knew we might never be there again so we wanted to soak it up while we could! Regardless of what any other reviews say...The Grand Wailea CANNOT BE BEAT! It was a dream come true for me and I will remember that stay forever! If you're looking for a romantic getaway or a fabulous trip that you can connect with the kids don't hesitate to try the Grand Wailea!! It's expensive yes...but well worth the time it takes to save.

Although the grounds and pools were beautiful, our room was not. The carpeting was worn out and dirty, the bathroom doors (around the handles inside and out) were paint-chipped and coated with grime and looked like they have never been cleaned (such a simple chore to take care of, too!), the toilet room wallpaper had lots of stains on it, which I hope were not from bodily fluids, and our lanai was a sticky mess from spilled drinks of previous guests. I have included some photos for you to see. The charge for this five-star deluxe ocean-view room was $790/night, plus taxes. Our ocean view was beautiful, but needless to say, the room was a huge disappointment, especially since we had read so many great reviews about this hotel. I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain what happened with this particular room, but we were unlucky enough to get it. We have never stayed in a five-star hotel room, which we do exclusively, that looked anything like this. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it was just this floor (the 7th floor off the Napua Tower elevators), this wing, or what, but unfortunately the Grand Wailea has (this) some really awful rooms. If you should decide to stay at this hotel, just be aware that at the very least it is a crapshoot, because not all the rooms are five-star in quality or cleanliness. Maybe two or three stars, but not five. I tried to check out other rooms for comparison, as we walked down the hallway of the 7th floor. I could tell that carpeting in some of the rooms has been replaced, so they have made some changes in carpeting in some of the rooms on the 7th floor. At check in, before we had even seen our room, we asked to be upgraded to a suite, but the woman at the front desk told us the hotel was operating at full capacity and there were no other rooms available. Maybe since they were operating at full capacity they opened up their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mature rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to accommodate a greater number of guests. She told us we could be added to a waiting list for a suite, but we declined, as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to play musical chairs. I absolutely regret that decision now, although, even getting a suite (or another room) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guaranteed. Our room was quiet the whole week until our final night, which was a Saturday night. It was noisy. There were guests, one or two floors down from us, who decided to have a drunken party which spilled out from their room onto their lanai. We could hear streams of foul conversations and foul words I would have liked my children to miss. That went on for about an hour before someone closed the party down. The staff was mostly pleasant, but I did get a sense that some of the staff are burned out. My worst experience was at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kula. The employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior towards a couple being served in line ahead of me was horrific. The couple had asked a simple question, and as they turned to walk away, the staff member mimicked them in a whiney voice. This staff member was so blatantly rude that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it. On the positive side, the food in the restaurants at the Grand Wailea were good. Pricey, but good. We dined in all the restaurants at the hotel, sometimes multiple times. Dinner for our family of four cost about $300 per evening. That included fresh fish and/or tenderloin for the entr\u00c3\u00a9e, a salad or side dish, soda pop, and dessert. Our bill didn't include any alcoholic drinks. I heard one woman at the pool complain that alcoholic drinks cost $12. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if that was true for all drinks, but it was believable, as this hotel (and Maui in general) is expensive. The breakfast buffet at the Grand Wailea Grand Dining Room cost $27/person. The food was good and, as with all the restaurants in the hotel, it has an incredible view of the ocean. We ate our breakfasts there every morning. As far as activities go, besides the multiple pools, the Grand Wailea has a scuba pool and they offer their guests free scuba diving lessons. We tried this activity (our children did, too!) and we had a great time. After an hour or two of lessons, they took us out in the ocean for an ocean dive. It was the hit of our trip. They also have kayak rentals (which we rented twice), surf board rentals, small boats, etc. Of course, the Grand Wailea pools, with their countless water slides and waterfalls, were a big hit, too. Even for us adults! The pools were the only thing that kept us from moving out of the hotel altogether, especially since these activities kept us busy outside of our dirty room. One tip, though. If you should decide to stay at this hotel, ask for a room that is somewhat close to the pool. It was a long hike for us to get to the pool, the water activities, restaurants, beach path, etc. It was another disappointment about our room. Our room was in desperate need of cleaning and refurbishment and we were especially disappointed that the hotel management continues to pass this room off as a five-star room. Shame on them! Had the hotel not been operating at full capacity, we would have asked for another room. In the end, our final Grand Wailea bill (hotel, food, and activities only) for the week was about $10,000. Too much for a two-star room(!), but everything else was (mostly) grand. After returning home, I emailed the hotel management about our disappointment in our stay, but so far (one week and counting), I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve received no apology or explanation from upper management explaining why they continue using this room (especially at this price!) Another red flag and disappointment. I would love a refund commensurate to the type of room we were given. You can bet that we won't be staying at this hotel again, nor recommend it, unless the entire hotel goes through refurbishment. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the chance again of getting another worn out Grand Wailea room. What is ironic is that we didn't stay at the Four Seasons Hotel (next door) because the rooms are currently under renovations (until June 2007).

Lots of fish in the shallows but if you follow the reef straight out you will find turtles and hear the whales. We even saw a Manta Ray glide by. Just amazing for a snorkel trip.

We had spent the first part of our vacation at the Hyatt Kaanapali and really liked it, but we were blown away by the Grand Wailea. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Napua Club Room, which is comparable to concierge level. Every evening we enjoyed complimentary hors d'oeuvres (crudite, crostini, etc.) and drinks (loved the planter's punch) and a delicious breakfast every morning, which included fruit, breakfast breads, and a hot item, such as eggs. Our room in the Napua Tower was very spacious. The bath amenities smelled so tropical and great - my daughter brought them home and enjoyed \"smelling like Hawaii\" for a few days longer! The grounds were immaculate and so beautiful. We loved strolling around in the morning and evenings and enjoying all the flowers and foliage. The pools were great fun. I enjoyed perching on a ledge along the edge of the pool with a good book every morning to get some sun. My husband and daughter had all kinds of adventures on the waterslides and in the little hideaway cove areas. We had heard that sometimes it was necessary to get to the pool area early in order to secure a chair. This wasn't a problem for us at all, I guess since we were there at a slower time of year. We had our pick of chairs around 8:30 each morning, and even around noon there were desirable chairs available. The beach was gorgeous, but the waves were a little stronger than we expected. Nothing too enormous, but they did pack some power. My daughter had a nasty wipeout on her boogie board one morning when wave picked her up and dumped her head first into the sand, resulting in a bloody nose. The staff at the beach booth were very helpful, setting her up with a bag of ice, cool drink, and fresh towel. I think my favorite part was the afternoon my daughter and I spent at the spa. The hydrotherapy pools (included in most spa treatments or available a la carte) were so relaxing. My daughter had a lava stone massage that she is still talking about. All the staff were so kind and helpful. Couldn't have been any better. The only restaurant on site that we tried was Cafe Kula.

After booking our 3 night stay by phone, the email confirmation arrived days later (after calling them back), and showed us as staying 4 nights, one more than we had reserved. We called the hotel to advise it of its error and were told that we would be charged for the cancelled night. When we objected to being charged for a night we had never reserved in the first place, the agent insisted (albeit politely) that hotel policy required the charge. Without success, we objected again--both to being charged for a night we hadn't reserved and to the discrepancy between the agent's description of the cancellation policy and the version on the hotel's website and on our emailed reservation, which said \"TWO NIGHT DEPOSIT AT TIME OF RESERVATION. CANCELLATION 14 DAYS PRIOR TO ARRIVAL\". Since we were staying 3 nights, the 2 night deposit wasn't a problem, if applied to 2 of the three nights we were staying. But it wasn't--it was being applied to the first AND LAST nights , so any shortening of the length of the stay - even a 60 day stay-would always result in a penalty. Over many years of staying at 4/5 star properties, we've never encountered such a policy, and it was especially galling to have it applied to a \"change\" in a reservation required by the hotel's own error. Is it possible there is a problem with disapointed customers wanting to leave early? The hotel being owned by the Hilton chain, we sought help from their main reservations department as well, who refered us back to the hotel front desk. . We reached a front desk manager after demanding to speak to someone with authority over the reservations. Finally, reason prevailed, and the front desk manager confirmed our reservation for the correct number of days, with no penalty. Take home lesson: when you book at the Grand Wailea, DON'T RELY ON IT'S WEBSITE FOR INFORMATION ON IT'S CANCELLATION POLICIES. Get the details in writing, and make sure that you get written, accurate confirmation of your reservation. Or, save yourself the trouble until the GW's reservation system improves, and stay at the Four Seasons or Fairmont instead.

We have stayed at the Kea Lani down the road before and I had enjoyed the spa at the Grand Wailea several times when I was staying elsewhere in Maui. We got exactly what we were expecting. It is a very large resort with grand and beautiful common areas and great pools. The spa is also wonderful and the staff, excluding the front desk, couldn't be more helpful and accomodating. The layout and architecture of the resort is still beautiful and the grounds are kept (for the most part) immaculate. The problem is that a luxury resort needs to keep their bedrooms and bathrooms updated and free of mold and rust. In addition, tiles, rugs and other common areas need to be refurbished often. This obviously hasn't happened at the Grand Wailea. The doors to the rooms are peeling paint and are scuffed horribly. I found mold spores on the ceiling of my bathroom, as well as rust spots where paint and/or wallpaper was peeling. The carpeting in the room corridors needs to be completely replaced. Not only is it old and outdated, but the dark blue pattern fights against the light tile work as the hallways give way to the outside areas. Some of the walkway areas also need work. In particular, some of the rock tiling in the walkways have chipped away and are uneven and unsightly. The Humuhumu restaurant was great and we enjoyed several dinners and drinks there. I cannot say the same for the breakfast buffet. Skip the bed and breakfast package and plan on ordering breakfast a la carte, which was much better than the meager offerings of the buffet (it pales in comparison to the Four Seasons). Lastly, when we checked out we asked for a handful of documents to be FedEX'd to my husband's work (using our own FedEX billing number). The front desk person blanched and asked us if we had time to walk the 10 minutes down to the business center and do it ourselves. Not the response we expected or should expect from this caliber of a resort. I assume the $5 tip we gave him for his trouble helped ease his reluctance a bit, but it definitely left a lasting and bitter taste in our mouths. In the end, I don't know if we'll go back to the Wailea -- I would like to see it updated first and a genuine attempt to put a bit more \"aloha\" into the front desk (our check out was not the only hiccup -- when we checked in, the room was not ready until after 4:30 p.m. and they didn't care about (or apologize for) the delay). Also, even though it was not very busy when we arrived, the bellman forgot to give us our welcoming Leis.

He was there for a conference, otherwise we would never have stayed in a place this opulent or expensive. The beach is nice for swimming, but not for snorkeling. The rooms are OK. We were first put in a terrible room by a main elevator and exit to the beach. We woke up around 6:00 every morning to the sound of large metal carts rolling over tile past our door. No privacy in this crowded area either. The bathroom smelled funny and we blocked up the toilet twice. And worst of all, I started waking up with mysterious bug bites. Halfway through our stay we finally asked to move, once I knew the bites were happening while I slept. They took one look at that, took some pictures, and moved us to a much nicer room on a higher floor with a nice view. Wish we'd done that in the first place. Toilet still had a funny smell, but at least it worked right. No more bites, no more problems. So, they did fix that for us. EVERYTHING you want to do here costs extra money. Room service fees are crazy (and the food, frankly, is not good at all with room service or at the little cafe out on the beach). I've never stayed at a \"resort\" like this before, so maybe it's normal, but there's an expected pattern you are \"supposed\" to follow. They practically herd you through the day. First, you are supposed to wake up between 8 and 9:00 and either have already ordered room service breakfast or a reservation for breakfast. Then, you should be out on the beach or in the spa by 10:30 or so. If in the spa, you're spending lots of cash already, so you're good. If you are outside, you should be sitting by the pool reading, tanning, or at the volcano bar. You should be ordering drinks (and I don't mean water). You should not be on the beach itself unless it is to let kids play in the sand; if you are out there, you will have to wrestle your own chair from a large stack, drag it away to where you want, and then never leave it our the employees will jump on it and drag it back to the stack. (You really are supposed to stay by the pools, not on the sand, all day). You should go to the cafe or to the poolside restaurant for a light lunch, to the pool restaurant if you have kids. You should get the kids ice-cream dots. After lunch they should play in the pool some more, lining up to use the rope swing or do the slides or whatever. (The pool is awesome, it's fun no matter how old you are). By 4:00 you should be thinking about going in for the day (and they shut down the water elevator), and by 5:00 you BETTER be going in (and they shut down the water slides). Everyone troops back to their rooms to shower and put on their nice clothes, and then heads to their expensive dinners. You order some more drinks at dinner, relax, smile, and then go in and stumble into bed. Wake up, repeat. So, if this sounds like heaven, the Wailea will certainly provide it for you. Personally I like to explore a little more, and find the people-herding stuff really obnoxious. The food here is pretty crappy compared to what you can get for the same money (or less) in other restauarants around the island. One thing we did right: we got a fridge put in the room ($25 fee) and went to the grocery store. Groceries are expensive (it is Maui) but cereal and fruit make as fine a breakfast at $5 as they do at $20. I did try the spa one afternoon. I had a great massage and the whole thing was really, really nice. Compared to what you spend in dallas, you do get quite a bit more with the whole terme' thing and the ability to hang out there and just relax, relax, relax. That was nice. Kids seem to love this place, especially because of the pool. *I* loved the pool. Hated the food. Rooms were nice enough, though they can't seem to lick the funny toilet smell. Showers are really nice. Extremely polite and helpful valets and bellman. Concierge people were nice too, though trained to keep funneling people into the same old stuff. If you have plenty of cash, this is a decent place to stay, especially if you want the fun pool or to have a system guiding you where to go all the time. If you can't stomach throwing money away at that rate, especially on an ostentatious, gaudy sort of place, look for something less expensive or more refined.", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cLove love love the Grand Wailea\u201d", "Author": "tpappy", "ReviewID": "UR6599501", "Content": "I absolutely love this hotel.

You can write all you want about the service at the 4 Seasons, but the Grand Wailea has it all over that admittedly fine hotel in the beauty dept. I think it was a Hyatt originally and whoever built it poured beauty and creativity into every corner of the public spaces of the hotel. Seeing it decorated for Christmas was a treat. The chef and staff had made a gingerbread village, lighted and complete with a beach shack, that was truly incredible. The Botero Bar,which I love, was draped with lovely gold fabric and trimmings, and poinsettias banked the Botero sculptures, which only seem to get more beautiful with each passing year. I agree that 15 years of hard use have made some repairs necessary and the hotel was undertaking small renovations while we were there- for example, the Kula Cafe where we usually get breakfast was closed. However it is minor wear, not major wear and nothing that would detract from my enjoyment of the hotel. The pools were in excellent shape and the gardens and koi loooked wonderful as usual. Excellent maid service. Very responsive service to all our requests overall. My tips for a great Grand Wailea experience? Self park your car, please don't participatei n towel wars, trying to stake out your area for the whole day- just think, if everyone stopped doing it, how much nicer it would be, (towel wars were OK this visit, unlike in April when i was there last), get your own water and pop for the room off property, and make a dinner reservation at Roy's in Kihei, you will not be disappointed. Also, I know the poolside burgers are expensive but the guacamole burger is great. Mai Tai's are made particularly wickedly. That means well. Ask for what you want nicely and 9 out of ten times you will get it. It is not easy to work at a hotel and a good attitude can really help. Go to the spa and you will enjoy it, I promise. The lomi lomi massage is great....and the Terme, which is the pools in the spa, are incredible so really, get there at least an hour early so you can enjoy before your service.

We went there on a holiday weekend, so maybe it is quieter other times, but it was a very raucous, crowded scene. Great for a couple of days, but not the place to go for a restful time.

I'll make this brief as many have already done a good job at reviewing the property. My partner and I visited for 4 days and 3 nights from Nov 16 until Nov 19th. Because of the time frame of our visit, arriving prior to the Thanksgiving Vacationers and departing once they had already arrived, it was like we experienced two different vacations. Prior to the Thanksgiving crowd, everything was calm, quiet and relaxing. Front seats at the pool, not having to wait in line for a cabana ($55.00 a day), excellent service... Then came the Thanksgiving crowd (we were told there were 800 kids staying there over the holiday) and gone was the calm and quiet relaxing stay and replaced with a family focused energy. We didn't mind the crowds as we knew what to expect over the holiday, especially at a fabulous family resort. It was fun seeing all of the kids so happy and excited about the pools. We just took advantage of the adult only pool area and were still able to get good lounge chairs in the mid morning. So, my advice to those of you who have the ability to choose your travel dates, I would strongly suggest avoiding the holidays unless you can set your expectations ahead of time.

We've typically rented one of the 2/3 BR Villas over at the Kea Lani, but decided to get two adjoining deluxe oceanfront rooms. The \"membership\" is mostly a rip-off. We did get our \"discount\" but this is calculated from the HIGHEST published rates, and was hardly a bargain. The nickel and dime fees were maddening: There is the resort fee $20, Valet fee, $15, Adjoining Room Fee $20 ea. as well as the usual excise fees. So this added up to about $100/night more than the \"discounted rate\" for each of the rooms ($1800 over our entire stay) With Maui, the prices are always high...but at the GW, they are outrageous, and the quality of the food was just not good at Bistro Molokini or the Volcano Bar. $25 for a cold, undercooked burger, a bag of Maui chips and a warm beer served by the horribly overworked pool wait staff was typical. We routinely went over to the 4 Seasons next door for breakfast because the food and service were excellent, and the prices were cheaper. The Kula Cafe had great food and the prices were sane The location was great, and we had excellent dinners at Ruths, Spago, Ferraros, Tommy Bahama Cafe, and Fire Dragon (mediocre) as well a few others farther away. Service ranged from disdainful/indifferent to excellent, depending on the situation. The attitude is pretty much one of \"if you don't like this place, go away....there are 10 more in line\", but there were a few people that were really nice and provided excellent service. The whole place was understaffed. At check in, it took us 45 minutes of standing in line, waiting on only 3 clerks. The whole place was dated, and worn out. Cracking stone, in the common areas, flagstone falling off, tile coming off the bond beams on the pools, etc. The hotel has obviously been really popular and looks like the hotels right around large convention centers that get enormous trade show traffic. The water features are cool, but the kids hated the line for the water elevator and ditched that after the first 2 or 3 times. The slides are long, and for safety's sake, the guards wait until the riders have cleared the bottom before sending the next rider. Unfortunately, this really makes the cycle time long and the lines are huge. My kids were sick of the waterslides after a day or two. I did get a charge out of the gamesmanship necessary to get coveted poolside chairs. If you aren't waiting in line by 6:45 and ready to get personal belongings onto the chairs as soon as you walk down, you are toast. There is an attendant walking around photographing \"unattended\" chairs to try to cut down on the \"land grabs\" but it is a tough job. In the summer, it must be completely nuts. My wife said that the Spa was terrific We went \"for the kids\" but they gave the GW \"three thumbs down\"", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windy City", "Title": "\u201cGrand Wailea over Thanksgiving\u201d", "Author": "MJS10", "ReviewID": "UR6178042", "Content": "My family and I (4 kids) just returned from 10 days at the GW. Like most avid readers of this website, I approached my stay with some reservation after combing through the mixed reviews. For frame of reference, I am a frequent work travler who stays in hotels over 125 nights a year. I also typically stay at upscale resorts with my family to ensure a quality experience. Overall I enjoyed our time at the GW, It is definately worth the money, and very family oriented. If I was traveling with my wife only or with couples, I would have selected the Four Seasons. (Realistically, I would have gone to Mexico instead of flying 9 hours) Spent some time walking through the FS grounds. Very upscale, elegent, and service oriented. Pool is quite small though and lacks any energy. Also, average age appeared to be in the 50s. GW - -Good- * Great pool lay out with numerous slides, waterfalls,hot tubs, volleyball etc.. * Location - GW is on the most ideal setting in Wailea - just awesome views of west maui mountains, molikini, Lanai etc.. * Grounds - well kept, never noticed garbage, always noticed employees keeping the gardens kept and the pool clean * Food is actually not bad at the Bistro * Spa - My wife said it was her best spa experience ever (1 hour pre treatment service, beautiful facility, great service, look out over the ocean * Thanksgiviing Buffet was great * Service - Pool Activity Desk - very nice and called you by name * On-site water activities - kayaks, snorkel - very reasonably priced, good gear, and friendly service * Check-in - greeted by name, given exact room we booked with connectors, fridge delilvered etc.. Concierge - very helpful, selected nice places, was not there to sell you time shares (Westin big on this) *Housekeeping - came twice a day, (12pm and 7pm) - helped us keep the room nice and neat *Rooms - deluxe garden - was located right by the pool, nice view, clean, fresh * Beach - this is the best hotel beach on Maui - sand is soft to the touch, water is clear as glass, snorkel by the point is awesome for young kids, waves always tame, nice running path -needs improvement- * Rooms are a bit out of date -- bathroom could use a double vanity, new tiles/grout, paint job etc....also could stand to have a bit more space - another 100 sq ft in the sitting area would make for a nice gathering spot * Pool chairs/decking - the family/activity pool deck is quite small for the size of the hotel. 50% of the chairs are pre-reserved for cabanas (had one for one day - not worth the money - service is not on par with traditional FS/ritz cabanas) Rumours were circulating that the hotel is planning to take out the chapel and add more pool space. Would be much appreciated. It is also true that by 7:15am most of the pool side chairs are taken up. * Pool service - there are not enough service attendants for the amount of guests, with 700 rooms - you need at least 6 folks working the pools. Each day I didn't notice more than 2. Contrast that to Bellagio in Vegas where you look up and see 10 service folks at any given minute. * Beach service - once you are set up - don't expect anyone to come by and take a drink/food order * Health club - nice size, but many of the machines are broke/old/worn out - they also only have a few of the more modern machines with TV's built in. * Another adult lounge would be nice - the only evening lounge is the lobby bar which is a bit serene -good restaurants- *Ferraros - FS > very nice setting, decent Italian - pricey * Pacific Grill - FS > great setting, great service *Longhis - Shops - typical Italian, decent food, close to the hotel * Cheeseburger - Shops - nice casual change of pace - burgers are just ok - not my favorite fries - * Roy's in Kehei - always a good meal with great kids service (price fixed kids meal that keeps the pace up) *HumuHumu - just OK - same menu as Spago, Pacific Grill, Nicks etc... (hawaiian fish is the staple) - preperations and seasonings were bland and the service was slow. Good for kids since it's outside and they can self entertain with the fish in the ponds. I echo the comments of others - go to safeway/ABC etc.. and get yourself some snacks for the pool/room. On a weeks trip you can save yourself at least $500 bucks vs the pool service costs. -Overall- The good far outweighs the bad. The location is just awesome. Best beach! The pools are a blast.

Things change dramatically at this resort once kids go back to school, since it has attractions that very much appeal to families. We found the atmosphere to be wonderful, and the facilities were very nice as well. The best things about it: 1. the pools. There are many different pools, and there are water slides connecting them together. It has very much of a water park theme to it. 2. the ocean. we found the beach to be very nice to walk and swim at, and it's only steps away. By contrast we stayed at the Hyatt at Kanaapali last year and essentially nobody goes in the ocean there because the beach is inhospitable. The worst things about it: 1. the water slides close at 5pm. This is probably so parents can get their kids out of the pools and ready for dinner, but I found it to be irritating since we typically went out in the morning and then tried to enjoy the pools in the afternoon or evening. 2. on our last day there they had a massive plumbing failure in the pools, requiring them to close essentially all of the pools for at least 24 hours. Apparently there was a pipe that burst, releasing a massive amount of dark brown water into one of the pools. Because they are all interconnected by water slides, this immediately caused all of the pools to be closed. I don't think it was a sewage pipe because it didn't smell, but it was clearly unswimmable for at least 24 hours. They didn't offer us any compensation to make up for the loss of swimming facilities. 3. the more expensive restaurant (Humuhumunukunukuapua'a) definitely wasn't worth the premium, either in view or food. My wife and I have very refined tastes in food, but frankly this place wasn't up to snuff. The other restaurant (Bistro Molokini or Bistro Molokai, depending on which sign you read) was much less pretentious with food that was just as good. We ended up walking next door to the four seasons for two of our dinners, since they had Wolfgang Puck's and another nice restaurant. The room we stayed in was on the 8th floor with a slight view of the ocean, but also facing a construction site across the street where they appear to be building either a hotel or a condo complex. The noise was tolerable from this, and the view of the ocean - while distant and slight, was still pleasant. I've never seen much point in paying for an ocean view room, since the whole point of going to these places is to be in or next to the ocean so I don't stay in the room that much. The bathroom was very nicely appointed, with marble and wide expanses of space everywhere. The closet was pretty tiny and inconvenient. We found the service to be quite good uniformly throughout the resort. This included the wait staff, the pool staff, the valet parking, the hotel operator, and the front desk. We never saw any evidence of sullenness or boredom (as we did everywhere in French Polynesia). The bottom line for a vacation is whether you would consider returning. If I compare this place to the Hilton Waikaloa on the big Island, or the Hyatt on either Maui or the Kauai, I like this place much better. All of these places have huge variance on what they charge for a room, and we found a package on Expedia that gave us the equivalent of about $400 per night.

As soon as we pulled up to the main entrance all worries melted away. Having read the reviews from previous guests I was a little apprehensive at first. I hadn't even removed my seat belt before the valet attendant said, \"Welcome to the Grand Wailea Mr. and Mrs. Harris\". Slightly surprised that he knew my name, it took me a second to figure out how he knew who we were. We were in a convertible and he read the nametag off the luggage in the back seat. They also offered us free valet parking for a few hours while we got checked in and we received our Hawaiian leighs. Check-in was a breeze. Absolutely no one in line (we arrived on a Monday evening). Our bellman was waiting at the elevator with or bags to show us to our room (8080). It was in the Haleakal wing on the 8th floor about half way between the lobby and the self-parking garage. It was a deluxe ocean view room and was absolutely wonderful. The view was amazing, as you will see from our pictures. The bellman told us about the resort, took our picture on the Lanai for us and was very helpful and courteous. We had a refrigerator brought to the room ($25 for the whole stay, not too bad). The adult pool was very relaxing, we preferred setting up on the grass lawn below the pool facing the ocean. It was much cooler in the grass then on the concrete by the pool. Service was a little slow and I could see how it would be a real problem if it were crowded but once you ordered a few drinks (At $10 a pop plus tip!) they were generally more attentive. The majority of the pool staff were adolescents who had the \"I don't care attitude\" but we were on our honeymoon and didn't care at all. The activity pool was really fun. It had lots of water slides, a water elevator (worth doing once but not that great), and a lazy river. Luckily for us we timed our stay perfectly and there weren't many kids (which I read had been a problem in other reviews). There were some people who would save chairs by the pool (even though the signs said not too) but since we wanted the grass lawn anyway it didn't bother us. The room was large and well appointed. The shower was wonderful and the bed was very comfortable. It wasn't overly impressive but still quite nice. They are beginning renovations very soon if not already so that won't be an issue soon. The room was always cleaned in a timely manner and the bed was always turned down every night. The grounds were beautiful, waterfalls, choi ponds, and lush gardens and expensive art everywhere. There were a few rails along sidewalks that were in disrepair but you'd have to be a nut to let something that small bother you. It was truly a Grand resort. It was quite large and could take some time to get to the beach from the room, as well as a few elevator rides. The only negative we had was the one time we attempted to eat at the hotel. We were goin to try the breakfast buffet the Sunday morning before we left. Supposedly it was open until 9:30 and we got there at about 8:45 AM and everything was already being removed. The server didn't inform us of this so we were walking around trying to find something to eat with little luck. All we ended up having was a cup of coffee which they didn't charge us for since the breakfast buffet was removed so early. If you plan to try it make sure you go early. We never attempted to eat at any of the other restaurants because of the bad reviews they got in the book \"Maui Revealed\" (Highly recommend this book!). We did have breakfast at the Country club in Wailea (Sorry can't remember the name) and it was wonderful. Had a beautiful view and the staff was impeccable! I recommend the mimosas. Overall we were very pleased with this resort although I wouldn't recommend going when it's crowded. Early September was perfect. All of the U.S. kids were back in school and the Asian tourists hadn't started arriving in mass yet.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui- Grand Wailea", "Title": "\u201c5 star outside, 3 star inside\u201d", "Author": "Xioujet", "ReviewID": "UR5932509", "Content": "Upon entering the Grand Wailea we immediately were impressed with the waterfalls on the drive way.

The property is very large, with gardens which range from manicured to charmingly wild. You can pick fruit from the banana or papaya trees, if you wish. We took a tour of the grounds with one of the gardeners, and he pointed out (among others) cocao trees! There are large koi ponds connected by flowing streams. The property's premier restaurant floats over a pond filled with a variety of tropical fish. You can wander out into the restaurant in the morning before it opens for lunch, and sit and watch the fish to your heart's content. The room itself was very nice; it had a featherbed over the mattress and superb linens. The bathroom was enormous and marble; the whole room gave you a feeling of spaciousness and luxury. The lobby area has side walls which are rarely closed, leaving the entire area open to tropical breezes. Beautiful artworks -- particularly sculptures -- are situated throughout. This property has an exquisite little chapel on the lawn near the ocean, perfect for weddings. The spa looked gorgeous, but I never actually made it there...I was too blissed-out by the pool. Actually, that's no excuse because the spa has a setup right beside the pool that offers pedicures, massages, manicures, hair braiding and the like. As we have a child, we were very happy to find the family amenities. There is a children's facility that charges by the half-day and is largely geared toward child care for younger children (ours was 10 when we went, and she was a bit too old for it). There were some specific kids' programs offered that were shorter in duration and focussed on a particular activity, and they were more her style. The pools are unbelievable. You will never find anything like it anywhere else. The adults' pool is comfortably distanced from the main pool complex, and it is lovely -- elegantly tiled in a floral design, deep enough for a proper swim, and surrounded by lounge chairs (free) or private covered cabanas (charge). The main pool is phenomenal. It has a series of small pools which are connected together -- and to the large pool -- by a maze of water slides and \"rivers\". One waterslide is adrenaline-pumping, and the other is much gentler. For those who like their water adventure more calming, you can just float along in a current underneath the bougainvillea bushes. If you want some social time, water volleyball and the like, you can hang out at the biggest pool. If you are seeking a little more quiet time -- or if you have small children who aren't ready for the big pool -- you can ride the water-powered elevator or walk up a series of stone steps to any of the smaller pools which are placed at higher levels in the complex. As I recall, there are at least three or four of them and they all have their own sets of lounge chairs and relaxing areas. The property has a variety of places to eat; we went primarily to the casual restaurant in the main building. If you are looking for a change, you can walk (either along the road or down a paved path that follows the oceanfront) past two other hotels to a shopping centre, which has a few restaurants. We had visited this resort several years back while staying in a Lahaina condo, and made the Grand Wailea our \"some day\" destination.

We are used to staying at 4 and 5 star hotels, and the Grand Wailea met all of our expectations. The rooms were large and clean. We had a deluxe ocean view king, and it provided a great view of the ocean and the resort grounds and chapel. The carpet in the room looked new to us.

Yes, the rooms may need a little updating sometime soon, but they are definitely not in disrepair. The pool area was fantastic. You don't have to have kids to enjoy all the fun water slides and rapids! We usually sat at the adults-only pool, which had a great view towards the ocean and was always peaceful. Poolside service was always available and always friendly. Chairs were always available, but we rented a cabana twice and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We read the many reviews below and did not let ourselves be cared off by negative comments. I have to say though, that many of the comments below regarding the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff are right on. To start, we arrived at about 2PM and the valet was empty, so got our lei's and other welcome necklace and proceeded to check in desk. I was amazed to see that as a Hilton Gold member, I was not able to be upgraded, considering I booked at Deluxe Ocean View room. In fact, once I pushed back on the check in guy, he \"spoke to the secret non existent\" manager in the back room and came out and actually asked me to pay the upgrade cost to move to a upgrade. I explained that I was a gold member and they were supposed to upgrade me should a room be available and he then completely lied to us and told us, the next class of room, Napua Tower, had no rooms with any ocean views. I, being a moron, believed him and just stuck with our Deluxe Ocean View room, but would later look out our balcony and see the Napua tower and notice that almost every room has some sort of Ocean view. The bellhop took us to our first room which was cramped and in a corner, near where the hotel turns and the next wing jets out. The room was not to our expectation, especially for a \"Deluxe Ocean View\". I asked him to call down and find us a different room, with a direct view of the ocean and not a view where I needed to turn my head to see water. We eventually were placed in a better room, but lower floor, 7 now instead of 8. We rented a cabana ($175 a day) for a few days and the service is very hit and miss. The waitress comes by often, however, the pool/cabana staff is not friendly at all and does not do much to make your stay enjoyable. In fact, the fruit tray and water that come with the cabana are brought out right away, no one asks when you would like it, plus the water is two Evian 1 liter bottles and a plastic bucket of ice that melts right away. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lucky, they may add some ice midway through the day. You do get a cold towel and maybe a Popsicle 1x during the day, but for $175 a day, I expect a smile. The staff is all local younger people, ages 18-25 and they seem to have a real issue with non local people. The pools are nice, however, the activity main pool broke (Pipe issue) and they closed it for a day which sucked big time because without that pool, I might as well stay at the Four Seasons next door where the service is very high quality and everyone is friendly and where the cabanas are free, just first come, first served. The food is average at best. Humahuma, the \"signature restaurant\" is very average and over priced, plus the service is average at best. We ate here our first night and have to say, very disappointed. At least the food got better each night as we ate off property. The places we ate and I highly recommend are Longhi's and Tommy Bahamas right next door at the mall and Spago at Four Seasons (Next Property over- take the path by the beach). The best food we had was at Mama's Fishouse, make a reservation, but this is the best food I have ever had in Maui. The breakfast (Grand Dining Room) is average; don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the buffet at $27 a person, order off the menu for an average cost of $17 a person. It is the same food, cooked to order. They do however take forever to bring the food out, even if you are one of 5 people in the place. I believe the kitchen is also the kitchen for room service, this backup. The property is beautiful, lots of art and plants...... The property is huge, everything is a walk, but that has to be one of the reasons you choose this property over the four seasons next door. The four seasons is smaller, more compact and more adult oriented. All in all, a nice stay, but make sure you are aware of the lack of service issues that surround the property. Being a\"waldorf\" property is deceiving; this is nothing like the service level you receive at the original Waldorf in NY.

Now here's the skinny from our one week stay in September. I will kind of break it down into some categories. ARRIVAL. Excellent, timely, professional. It was better than arriving at most Ritz Carltons. VIEW. Excellent! For the first time in my life I got what was promised. Room 9080 was on the highest floor and we were in the center of the \"U\" shaped hotel complex. Yes, I agree that if you are on a lower floor, then you will have some palm trees blocking your water view. But the water is so far away, it really doesn't matter. Sitting on the balcony you could occasionally hear the ocean, but that's about it. Everything is drowned out by the man-made streams and fountains down below. ROOM. Filthy. I'm an engineer so lets talk observations and some form of empirical measurement. I walked around the bed in white socks and within about five minutes, the bottoms of my socks were filthy black. The carpeting was heavily soiled and in the week we stayed there, it was vacuumed once. The bedspread was threadbare and tired. The upholstry on the seats looked par for a Sanford & Son show. The floor on the balcony was also filthy. HOUSEKEEPING. I travel a lot and have found that generous tipping up front usually guarantees my family will be treated well. I gave $100 to the housekeeping manager to be shared by those working my room. Nothing changed. In fact, it might have gotten worse. They come in, make the bed, change the towels, hit the tables tops a swipe or two, empty the trash and hit the trail. It's probably the worst I've seen in any Hilton. The room was simply filthy. POOL. We are not sun worshipers, but the place looked fine to me. There also seemed to be plenty of pool maintenance. BEACH. Nice to walk on and seemed to be groomed about twice a week. FOOD. Had dinner at the nicest restaurant on the property- I can't remember the name because it's a way long word with all those mumbo jumbo Hawaii sounds: moona-moona-humma-humma... you get the idea. It was reasonably priced, the service so-so and the food so-so as well. It's a Hilton, what do you expect? The restaurant sits on a little man-made lagoon and the view was nice. The place was somewhat empty when we were there and I couldn't help but come away with the feeling the place was going out of business soon. I got a refrigerator for our room and we mostly snacked. Also, the Jura cafe on the main floor serverd great foods at stateside prices. Their hot breakfast was GREAT! The lady running it was the nicest employee I met anywhere on the island. DEPARTURE. Smooth at the front desk, then waited 45 minutes for the valet to get our car. Ouch! I'd go back, but would take my own cleaning supplies and do my room the first day.

This place is truly breath taking. I have nothing but positive things to report about the Grand Wailea. The resort grounds were stunning, the staff was friendly and accomodating, and my delux garden view room (with a bonus patial view of the ocean) was wonderful. Since September is not \"peak\" family vacation time, the pool was not overrun with kids as some reviewers complained. There were plenty of seats in the sun and shade by the pool and the beach had space to spread out and enjoy the beautiful blue water. The pool was relaxing, especially at the grotto swim up bar. My king room and bathroom were spacious, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The bed was almost as comfortable (if not more) as my bed at home. Room Service breakfast on the lanai was the perferct start to each day. The food was expensive as previous reviewers noted, but the prices were comperable to most resturants in Maui so I can not complain. The food quality was good and there were no watered down Maita'is here. You absolutely MUST schedule time at the spa during your stay at the Grand Wailea. You will not be disappointed by the baths or your treatment. Valet service was quick - my car was always waiting if I called down ahead. Though we received notice of some repairs and work being done on the resport grounds, I did not hear any construction noise. There was a small amount of work being done in the pool area, but it did not interfere with use of the pool or the overall beauty of the resort. The time I spent at the Grand Wailea helped make my trip to Maui a dream vacation! An additional recommendation for your trip to Maui...be sure to eat dinner at Mama's Fish House.

The resort is gorgeous and the rooms are quite large. We had no smells whatsoever. We had tiny ants in the bathroom but they seemed friendly and didn't bother us so we didn't report them. We were given an ocean view/front room in the Lagoon wing. We talked to another couple that were over by the Chapel wing that did mention a smell to their room but it sounded like they reported it and were moved. We understand a full renovation is coming and the rooms could probably use it but nothing was detracting at all. Maid service came at least twice a day to tidy up and check the room supplies. One couple mentioned their room got missed one day but 1 phone call got them taken care of. We found the entire staff to be extremely friendly. Always smiling and saying \"hi\". Those that complained that the staff was rude or unfriendly probably walked around with scowls on their faces not offering up smiles or greetings of their own. We said \"hi\" to a number of people and got the cold shoulder back. It's a large resort so you're going to do some walking. Anyone complaining about that failed to do any research and should stay at a small, boutique hotel. Likewise, those that thought the beach was too far away and the hotel should be set closer are not only lazy but impractical. Probably the same people that complain about kids but stay at a hotel that clearly advertises water slides and a camp specifically for kids. Common sense, people. We don't have kids but found the water slides and pools to be quite fun and clean. The hotel was nearly deserted for the first several days, which was quite nice. It was booked full by the end of our stay and it did seem pretty crowded but big resort = big crowds if they are doing something right and it wasn't bad. We always found the right amount of shade and chairs around the pools. There isn't any shade at the adult pool unless you rent a cabana but again, we always found shade at the other pools. There were always servers at the main pool but service was much slower at the other pools. I think the amount of servers depended on occupancy, which would make sense since there is a lot of ground to cover. There was some wallpaper coming off in the main pool bathroom but considering the moisture in there, I'm not surprised. We walked over to the Four Seasons and were surprised at how cramped it felt. Nice but the pool was a joke compared to the Grand and the main fountain wasn't even running. Wouldn't stay there. Sure some of the Grand's beach chairs and equipment could stand to be replaced as the elements have been weathered quite a bit but nothing that would detract from one's vacation. The one thing we continually bemoaned were the food prices. Maui's expensive - no matter where you go. Expect to pay double if not triple what you are used to back home. $7.50 for OJ in the main dining room for breakfast. We bought snacks for the room at the grocery store. We enjoyed Roy's, Fred's and Sansei. (All in Kihei). We ate at Kimo's in Lahaina twice. Really enjoyed Joe's Grill at the tennis courts just above the Shops at Wailea. They have an early bird special from 5:30 to 6:30. (buy 1 get 2nd entree free) Great views of the sunset. Also really liked Kincha's at the hotel. Didn't have reservations but were seated quickly at the sushi bar and my husband enjoyed his cooked dinner as much as I enjoyed my raw food. Ate twice at Tommy Bahamas early on and wouldn't recommend it. The one \"gripe\" we had/have. Turn off your stupid cell phones!!! Whether it was poolside or in restaurants - people fail to realize how loud they are talking or are too rude to care. People are not staring at you because they are in awe of you or your conversation. They're giving you the stink eye to get a clue and shut up! We had a wonderful time and would stay there again if we have kids. Nothing against the Grand. We just like to try different places. We shook our heads at the older couple that didn't like the table they were offered for breakfast in the Maui Dining Room and stood disgruntled in the middle of the room while the staff quickly cleared the table they deemed fit for them. As if there is a bad seat in that restaurant! Our order that morning was slightly wrong and the waitress immediately offered us both the full buffet at no charge and apologized profusely, which we thought was a very nice gesture and a nice end to a perfect vacation.

So was our room at the Grand Wailea was a ten minute walk to the beach by time we snaked through the hotel and the hugely crowded pool area. The best beach in the area is Big Beach at Makena State Park just south of the Grand Wailea about 3 miles. The rooms at the Grand are very Grand and worth the price but for the price I would like a little more than direct beach access. We had an amazing view of the ocean and all the weddings, and the pool crowds, and the beach. I recommend you get your chair early in the morning or pay big $$$ for a private cabana. That was not in our budget. As it was at the end of the week there we had racked up more than $3000 in room charges in addition to our room charges. You pay for everything here when we were done we had spent close to $11,000.00 We had as much fun in our condo the second week and the whole week including meals cost way less than our room charges. I searched, \"vacation rental by owner\" and found several sites that catered to vacation rentals. The one really big plus of the Grand Wailea is the effectiveness of the pool area to keep children busy all day long. The kids meet other kids there and they form \"instant life long friendships\" that really gave my husband and I some alone time. I must recommend the adult Hibiscus Pool......stunningly beautiful. We did a seaside private dinner which they set up for us to watch the setting sun. Had it been a little more remote and less busy it would have been perfect.

A few weeks ago, we decided to try the Grand Wailea since we heard it was the best hotel on the island. From the outside, the hotel looked very promising. The exterior was beautiful, the pools spectacular, and the beach access unbeatable. But from the moment we pulled up to the valet, we realized that the hotel was simply a body without a soul. As we pulled up, we had to wait a minute or so before we were \"greeted\" by a valet. In fact, we had already unloaded our bags before one of the valets finally showed up. As we walked into the lobby, the female greeter uninterestedly placed leis (sp ?) around our necks. She didnt even bother smiling. I contrast this with the warmth and friendliness that greeted us everytime we arrived at the Fairmont. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 3:30pm, which is about half an hour past the official check in time. However, our room was still not available and we were asked to simply wander about the hotel and were told that we would get a call on our cell phone when our room was ready. Half an hour later we still had not received a call and decided to go back to the front desk. After waiting a somewhat lengthy time to finally speak to a front desk person, we were told that our room was ready. Where was that phone call? When we got to our room, we were fairly unimpressed. The bathroom looked dated and the overall size was smaller than the rooms at the Fairmont. The pool area is truly the gem of this hotel. There are something like 10 pools and various slides and water attractions. However, if you're an adult, you might find the number of screaming kids a bit overwhelming. The hotel had a feel comparable to your average waterpark. Nevertheless, my friends and I still enjoyed the pool. The easy beach access was also a positive as it was just a few steps from the pool area. My biggest complaint about the hotel is the service, or lack thereof. There was none of the island love, or general hospitality that you would expect from a 5 star resort, or more importantly a hotel that costs 500-900 bucks a night. The staff members rarely smiled, they seemed bothered when you approach them with a question, and generally seem out of place at a high-end resort. None of the little touches were found at the Grand Wailea. For example, at the Fairmont, smiling pool side employees would frequently walk around handing out fresh pineapples. At the Marriott Ihilani in Oahu, they had a jolly guy walking around the pool spritzing cool water on the feet of hotel guests. Those little things are so important when you pay the kind of rates you pay at the Grand Wailea. The capper to our 5 day stay was the jack hammering that started at 7:30AM during the last 2 days of our stay. Imagine if you will, waking up in paradise to loud jack hammering...at 7:30 in the freaking morning. When we complained during the last day, they told us that they had left letters in our rooms telling us of the jackhammering. First, we didnt get a letter. Second, who cares if you they left a letter? Why not wait until a more reasonable time to start causing that kind of noise. Fortunately they decided to comp us one night which made the experience slightly more bearable. My last memory of the Grand Wailea was back in the valet. After the valet pulled up the car for the final time, he sat there and watched as my friends and I struggled to place the bags in our trunk. No offer to help. Needless to stay, I will never again stay at this hotel. I've warned my friends who are planning trips to Hawaii to stay away from this place. If this was a normal 200 dollar a night hotel, I really wouldnt have cared.

We were a family of 4- kids 9 and 5. We had a deluxe garden view that faced the pools and part of the ocean, we couldn't believe it. I got goosebumps and chills when we saw our view, the kids were ecstatic! Heaven! The pools- A+, my kids loved all the waterslides, the tarzan rope was my son's favorite, the water elevator was very cool. Yes, this is a FAMILY resort and for families, it is awesome! If you are on your honeymoon, I suggest you stay on the chapel wing away from the pool area and kids and hang out at the adult pool. We went into the 4 seasons and that is a nice place to stay for a honeymoon but not as entertaining as GW for the kids. The food at hotel- Cafe Kula B-/C+, great since it is close to the pools but lunch items are fair in quality. Breakfast was better. We ate lunch and dinner at the Wailea shops or in nearby Kihei where prices and food quality were better. Housekeeping, Valet, Check in- out- A+ When we came back to the room one afternoon, the maid had arranged my daughters American Girl dolls in a cute fashion holding hands. She was thrilled! We also LOVED all the art that was displayed throughout the hotel and gardens, just gorgeous. The beach was also great and my kids had a blast making sand castles and burrying themselves in sand. It is a little pricey but as the below review says, if you know that ahead of time, then you will be alright. Those who have negative reviews, I believe they did not educate themselves about the resort and had different expectations. Again, it is a FAMILY resort and every dollar was worth it as it was the BEST vacation our family has had yet. We plan to go every year, we were all so sad when we checked out that we HAVE to go back. :) To the below reveiwer, how did you get a room for $300 a night?

This was our second visit to this property, the first being in January 2005. We are in our early 40s and we did not bring children. Overview: The Grand Wailea is a Hilton-owned hotel (as of August 1, 2006) located in the Wailea resort area on southwest Maui, which is the sunniest part -- and hence the most expensive part -- of Maui. The hotel is approximately 30-40 minutes from the Kahului airport; it is just outside the town of Kihei. Renting a car at the airport is a necessity as there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shuttle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service or public transportation to the resort area. Price/Value: We paid $656/night for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 room, this being the high-season rate. It is difficult to make a distinction, however, between the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ocean view rooms in that most rooms are set back several hundred feet from the beach and are to some degree blocked by palm trees. Our supposed full-ocean view room only obliquely viewed the ocean. To see the ocean required standing outside the room on the left side of the patio: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ah, THERE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S the ocean!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In our opinion, there are very few genuine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ocean view rooms -- as in dead-on, sight unobstructed views of the ocean. Upon check-in we were delighted to find out that we had been upgraded to a Napua Tower room, which is closed off from the other floors by a card-activated gate and includes complimentary continental breakfast (eggs, breads, and fruit, no meat) each morning and a complimentary (!) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy hour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the evening. Additional charges include valet parking of $15/day and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of $20/day. Taxes ran about 4.5%. Accommodations: The Grand Wailea was built in 1991 and in some respects the rooms need upgrading, such as the low-end bathroom sink and shower fixtures that would not have looked out of place in an interstate motel. The air conditioning was the biggest issue -- the rooms do not have digital thermostats but rather the cheap dial and switch controls -- you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to set the room temperature. Further, although not intolerable, it seemed if the a/c was having some difficulty cooling the room. This being said, the room was otherwise very tastefully appointed, comfortable, with ample space. Our room had a roll-away couch and coffee table. Each room has bathrobes and high-end toiletries and towels. There is an in-room high-speed internet connection for your laptop with unlimited use, the cost of which is covered under the resort fee. Service: The best part of the hotel, it seemed to us, was the staff. Everyone, from the valet to the maids to the poolside waitresses to the front-desk to maintenance (after checking in we found our plantation doors stuck) was efficient and polite. The one exception the whole time was service one afternoon for lunch at the Bistro -- the server was incompetent, but still pleasant. Oh well. Restaurants: The Kincha Japanese restaurant was closed for two of the days we visited (it is always closed on Tuesday and Wednesday) and the seafood restaurant, Humuhumunukunukuapua\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a (not making that up), was booked both times we tried to get in. Consequently, the only Grand Wailea restaurant at which we ate was the Bistro, for dinner one day and for lunch another. The Bistro overlooks the pools and is essentially bar/grille type food: sandwiches, pizza, salads, and some basic seafood selections. We paid $17 for a hamburger, $16 for a personal pizza, $9 for soup, and $24 for a seafood salad. The main restaurants will run roughly $60/person, exclusive of alcohol, for dinner. Amenities: There are two very large and well-maintained pools at the Grand Wailea, one of them being adults-only (which evidently is actually enforced) and the other being all-ages, highlighted by a water slide and grotto. We were able to get good location pool lounges only because I went down each morning at 7:00am and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd two lounges with beach towels. One good thing: the towels and chairs are included in the resort fee. I understand that some resorts charge for chairs/lounges and towels. A cabana, however, will run you $225/day. The less crowded beach is shared with the adjoining Four Seasons and was quite scenic and enjoyable. Other amenities include snorkeling, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Camp Wailea\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for kids, and an attractive chapel for weddings, with an actual Sunday morning service here for guests . Clientele: Most guests ranged from the 30s-50s, with a good number of families with young children, some retirees, and, of course, honeymooners. We saw very few singles, teens, or twentysomethings. The resort is definitely not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd atmosphere. Other reviews have bemoaned the large number of children. While there are lots of kids, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that it was a Disney-like atmosphere or that children were overly obtrusive. Area attractions: Adjoining the resort are the Shops at Wailea, containing high-end shopping such as Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Yves-Saint Laurent but also containing the obligatory t-shirt shops and two convenience stores. Within the Shops are four restaurants: Tommy Bahamas, Cheeseburgers in Paradise, Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Steakhouse, and Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs Italian/Seafood, at all of which we ate and enjoyed. Literally minutes away in the town of Kihei are fast-food restaurants, pharmacy, and a variety of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153local\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurants. We had some excellent Mexican food at a Moose McGillycutty\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs. There is also a Safeway in Kihei, located on the Piliani Highway on the way to/from from the airport. My wife and I stopped in to stock up on soda, juice, munchies, and some alcohol -- doing this saved a lot of money. (And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the principle of the thing: we take it as a personal insult to pay $3.50 for a Snicker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from the mini-bar.) The town of Lahaina is about 30 minutes up the coast from the resort. The drive offers a striking view of the Maui coastline and of nearby islands. The town of Lahaina itself used to be the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary port and was the royal seat of government, and currently is something like an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old town\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd downtown area, offering a diversity of restaurants, shops, and entertainment fronting the ocean. The town is nearly all walkable. Forget the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153road to Hana.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 It is literally an all-day drive, is unnerving and decidedly not relaxing, and is mostly all green forests. On our first visit to Maui, we started on it but ended up turning around and coming back. A better drive (shorter, safer, and more scenic) is to the crater atop the 10,000 foot Haleakala volcano, under whose shadow the Wailea area is located. Summary: We plan to continue vacationing in Maui and will likely stay in Wailea again, although we may give either the Four Seasons or the Fairmont a try. Depending on what time of the year you go and in what type of room you stay, understand that at the Grand Wailea you will spend something around $1000/day total, excluding airfare and any shopping. Bottom line: The Grand Wailea is indeed wonderful, but horribly expensive and not without flaws. Hope this helps!

We would definitely stay there again We chose this resort for 4 reasons 1. When we were in Hawaii last and we visited it (it was a Grand Hyatt then) we loved the hotel and said that if we ever go back to Maui we would stay there 2. Friends of ours moved to the Wailea area and we wanted to be close to them 3. We knew the kids would love the pool 4. The price was right at $300 per night compared to other hotels in the area for the same dates (Aug 18-27, 2006) We had a terrace room which was great we had a view of the mountains on the left and to our right a slight ocean view through the palm trees. The rooms is large and comfortable with plenty of space for 4. We did notice that the room was starting to show a little wear but not enough to bother us. I do know they are going to start renovating them soon For anyone that has stayed there on their honeymoon I hope your travel agent didn't steer you there as it is a family resort with a lot of kids but it depends on your style of hotel. Friends and family of ours that have stayed there without kids also loved the hotel because they liked the large pool area and the slides. I am sure if you are going when school is in session you will have a lot less kids at the resort. Also if you don't have any kids why not utilize the adult only pool? I spend some time there on my own and loved the piece and quiet Restaurants - we tried Kincha's for dinner and Bistro Molikini for lunch one day. Both were very good, even though they are overpriced. We didn't like the food or quality of food at the casual Cafe Kula at all and only got fuit, snacks, etc there. We stayed away from the hot foods Yes the service at the pool was slow or non existent at times but since we only really needed it when we had lunch we went over to the tables at the pool area instead of eating at our seats. We actually preferred this as there was shade and they always had ice cold water available if you wanted it Do I think all the food is overpriced? yes definitely since cheeseburgers were $15 each but I have to tell you that the quality of the cheeseburgers at the pool area was a lot better then the Cheeseburger restaurant at the Shops at Wailea and theirs started at $11 each. No we didn't eat cheeseburgers each day I am just using this as an example We did go to Safeway and purchased water, soda and a few snacks for the rooms so that we didn't have to purchase it at the resort. I find that the kids are always hungry after getting back to the room from the pool or beach and having snacks in the room for them was definitely worth it. Unfortunately we didn't get to go into the ocean a whole lot because it was pretty rough and the kids really couldn't handle it for long so we were glad we had a large pool to enjoy. Check in / Check out - both were fast and everyone we dealt with was courteous Valet / bell service - Both were quick and no problems whatsoever. We were there for 9 nights and after a couple of nights the valet people knew us pretty well. Valet always asked us if we needed directions or recommendation for restaurant, sights, etc each time they brought our car around. The only time there was ever a wait for the car was during peak dining time when a lot of people were leaving the resort but after the first time experiencing this we would call for the car at least 30 minutes before we were ready to leave the room and it was always waiting for us when we reached the front of the resort Botero Bar - was a lot of fun but I think a lot of it had to do with our friends that live in Maui knowing the bartenders there, which made it more fun and personable The only thing that I noticed is that pick up of room service trays people left outside their door was left out for quite a long time but the one time we ordered a snack from room service, we called for pick up of the plates and they were there within 5 minutes. I do have to say that the food through room service was very good, arrived piping hot and was presented beautifully Things that bothered me, this is not the hotel's fault, is the people who let their kids run all over the place without being supervised. Again the people who leave their trash everywhere including the edges of the pool. Yes they nickle and dime you to death at this hotel but being from the NYC area most hotels in NYC are the same where they charge for everything. If you don't know that going in then you haven't done your research. If the high prices of everything at the hotel will bother you then this is not the resort for you. They bothered me a little but I knew it going in and went out for breakfast instead of eating at the restaurant and only ate one dinner in the hotel because we wanted to try Kincha's. Maui is not cheap in the least even eating breakfast at Denny's is a lot more then what you would spend back at home and we eat at Denny's for breakfast maybe once every two years at home so it isn't a place we utilize often We did find that most of the lesser expensive restaurants in the area didn't have good service at all. If you wanted better food with good service you had to eat at the higher end places. We found through our friends of ours that the reason for this is the lower priced restaurants have a higher turnover of wait staff then the higher end restaurants where people tend to stay put longer Other places we ate at Cafe O'Lei - twice - first night great service and great food, second night service not good at all but food was still great Tommy Bahama - twice - very good food and service Spago - anniversary dinner - great service, great food, well worth the price.

After spending 6 amazing nights at the Hyatt, we were excited to get the the Grand and see what the fuss was about. As it turns out, it's much ado about nothing. Valet service was non existent (perhaps because we weren't in a Mercedes), and overall the customer service was marginal at best. If you have the money to stay anywhere, but would prefer a bit of hospitality and friendliness over glitz and glamour, try the Hyatt. The hotel was a bit overstated and didn't feel much like Hawaii at all - my 9 year old son observed \"This a place where rich, old people would stay\". If snobby Newport Beach is your thing, you'll love the Grand - if you want someplace to stay where customer service isn't based on your perceived annual income, try the Hyatt. That being said, the room was OK - we had a good view of the ocean, the bathroom was beautiful with separate tub and shower - a great feature for familes after a day at the beach. The pool complex was like a shrunken water park, but was really chaotic, and crowded with unsupervised spoiled kids running rampant. The Tarzan swing was a huge hit with our kids, but not enough to make the Grand some place we'd ever go back to. The beach is really nice, but we were plagued with big surf from an approaching storm that kept us from snorkeling anywhere in the south part of the island. That's not a knock on the Grand, and I'm sure during better weather, this beach would be near perfect - but you could stay elsewhere and go to Big Beach for the same sand and spend MUCH LESS $$$'s! Our bell hop, and three of the lifeguards were the only employees who showed any enthusiasm for their work. Lee who works at the pool was a real kick, and his personality seemed to embody what the resort was missing! Friendly, good natured, and easy going! Everyone else seemed to going through the motions, or waiting for a tip One girl at the pool desk couldn't even stop text messaging on her cell phone long enough to give me a dry towel!! At the Volcano grill, I paid $15 for a dried out burger with a cold bun and a sack of chips, and had to wait to be seated in a puddle of sandy water!! We ate the rest of our meals off property in Kihei where it's quirky, seedy, and much more down to earth!! I'm no snob, but if I'm going to shell out big bucks, I expect big service! Overall, the good bathroom, and fun pool, was not enough to win us over. We found Wailea to be too high end and pretentious to really feel like the laid back - casual Hawaii we know and love.

Rest assured this is a beautiful hotel, on a gorgeous beach with wonderful pools and the staff was nothing but kind and helpful the entire 7 days we stayed. I should start by saying that this was a family vacation, two boys ages 12 and 9, my husband and myself. We enjoy a vacation once a year and usually stay at 4-5 star properties. The best advice I have is to relax, and enjoy yourself. No hotel is perfect and if that is what you are expecting than I am sure you will find something to be disappointed in. First, the disappointing and then on to all of the good stuff we enjoyed at this hotel. We got a great package thru pleasant hawaiian but booked a terrace view, the least expensive since I know we do not spend a lot of time in our room. We were disappointed to be on the far south side of the molokini wing overlooking the self parking structure and a construction site across the street. I was determined not to let the view bother me but the noise from some sort of generator down below was constant and did bother us as we had breakfast out on the lanai every morning. Luckily with the door closed we couldn't hear a thing. I did not even attempt to change rooms, didn't want the hassle. There were people in the lobby who had been trying to change their room for days and were not having any luck. It's hard because there are only so many perfect rooms at every hotel and the hotel was full the entire time we were there. I think the big difference is that when you pay a premium for your room the hotel had better live up to your every expectation or you are going to be very upset. Booking a terrace room saved us that headache. The rooms were large, the bathroom huge and the bath products my favorite. The beds however were quite uncomfortable with a lumpy pillow topper and pillows that were stiff and hurt your neck. I won't say much about the price of food except that everything is riduclously overpriced. We used Maui revealed to find some great places off site that were still expensive but much more reasonable and with better food than the hotel ( Maui tacos, bada-bing, and Antonio's were favorites. skip the hamburger place at the Wailea shops, worst service I have ever had in my life and the burgers were dry) Now to the part we really enjoyed. The hotel is drop dead gorgeous. Art and flowers every where. We took so many beautiful photos here. The pools are every thing you could want and more. Our kids loved them. Yes, they were crowded but we always found chairs and since we are from southern california we didn't bother with renting cabanas and such. Some broken pool tiles, who cares? The pools were very clean every morning and yes by late afternoon they are not so clean. Whose pool is with that kind of useage? We enjoyed the sun and the cool afternoon tradewinds. The beach is lovely, we snorkeled in the morning and boogie boarded in the afternoon. My 12 year old really enjoyed the complimentary scuba instruction in the pool. Jeff his instructor was so good with the kids that I let him take the optional beach dive. I am sure that was a memory of a life time for him. How cool is it to see huma-huma's every morning off of your hotel beach? Service was tops for us. Everyone single employee greeted all of us with smiles and a warm greeting every single time. Check in was a breeze, there were not any incorrect charges on our bill upon check out. The concierge was quick and helpful with directions to many of the out of way places we wanted to try. We had a late flight so we got a later check out time and a complimentary suite to shower and change in with out any problem. Checked out at 1pm, enjoyed the pool and beach one last afternoon. One last lava flow for me, one last frozen lemonade for the kids. Call front desk from house phone at the pool one hour before you need to change. Complimentary suite ready after waiting about 15 minutes at front desk. Everyone fresh and ready for the flight home. What a way to end a great vacation.

The hotel is completely run down and needs an overhaul. No ambiance whatsoever. Pool area is DISCUSTING! Poor upkeep and if you don't reserve chairs for yourself by 7 a.m. you won't have a seat anywhere all day. Absolutely ridiculous not to be able to get a chair when you are paying that kind of money @ a hotel. Food and service is grotesque at best. People @ the front desk paid much more attention and hovered around a woman next to me who was carrying a Black Centurion Amex card, while they made me wait next to her for over an hour just to change my room to another \"palm tree view\" room (but then again I'm only a Platinum Amex card member, what would they care!) Spa needs a redo. The place smells of mold, and there are WAY too many obnoxious teenagers running around, smoking in the elevators, yelling and screaming. It was not romantic and had no ambiance whatsoever! What I will tell you is for you to take your hard earned money, drive 2 mins past the Grand Wailea and go stay @ The Four Seasons. I stayed there last time and it was a dream come true.

The room is good, quite spacious and I CAN see the ocean from my 6th floor room (I guess we got lucky). Hotel grounds are lovely and extensive with loads of Koi ponds and waterfalls. It's peak season so the pools are filled with kids but the beach isn't crowded and it's easier to get a chair. I'd recommend the room + Breakfast package as the buffet is fine and it'll probably cost you more to eat a la carte. The staff are friendly but I wouldn't say that they go the extra mile considering the hotel rating and room prices. I have had better at Ritz Carlton, Westin and other 5* hotels. I'll agree that they do Nickel and Dime you, although you wish it were just Nickels and Dimes. The hotel is expensive, to eat, sleep and play will cost you a pretty penny! But I've looked at some of the other hotels (including the Four Seasons next door) and this one may just have one of the best overall packages for pools, gardens, beach, eating and accommodation. It's probably especially good for families as the kids will swim all day. That said I couldn't give it top marks because for the high cost there are no hammocks between palms (come on this is Hawaii it's what you'd expect), the staff could do better, everything closses at 9:30 and the overall finish isn't the best, so the Wow factor is low. To end there was a bit of a fiasco at checkin with room availability that many people seemed to be suffering from, we had to stay in a garden view room for the first night (they comped it though and gave us a drink at the bar!!).

I think I was expecting too much. I was a little disappointed at first, but that's not to say that we did not enjoy ourselves there. First the minuses: 1.the gap between shore and even the ocean front rooms is large enough so as not to be able to hear the sounds of the surf crashing against the shore--that's a big minus in my book. We had a basic ocean view (not deluxe) and the view was stunning but still very far back from the ocean. 2. The tile hallways let out an echo. We could hear everything that passed through those hallways outside our doorway---wheeling of meal carts, service carts, rollaway beds, high heels clopping, children running, etc. 3. Poor customer service at concierge desk--maybe it's that our Westin Concierge (Pamela) spoiled us too much. The Grand Wailea had great check-in staff and bell attendants but after that the service was mediocre to bad (except at Spa). Concierge acted too busy to help us every time and took at least 30 seconds or more to acknowledge our presence. 4. Bed--horrible lumpy mattress and down pillows with no support or too big pillows that put a kink in my neck. NOT at all an upgrade from the Westin \"Heavenly\" beds. 5. Self Parking could be VERY far away depending on where your room is and the rooms with the best views are farthest from the self park garage . The Grand Wailea reserves the entire garage that is closest to the lobby for its valet parking. If you want to self-park, they make you walk farther away to another garage. You'd think they'd want to make life easier for all those who self park After all the valets can easily golf cart their way to the garages but they don't seem to care if it inconveniences most of their guests to have to hike to get their cars. Now the pluses: 1. The Spa---what a nice retreat, but the lanai which is where you go to just sit for a few minutes at the end of your massage or facial, etc is just not big enough to accomodate all the people who finish their spa services at the same time. FYI---the Westin Spa was much better equipped in the couples massage room where I got my prenatal massage the table was a state of the art massage table that raises and lowers and curves to elevate your legs(like a posturpedic bed) to maximize your comfort--Spa Grande has no such thing but all those hydrotherapy options make up for it. The cascade waterfall shower was my favorite to ease stiff shoulders and neck (because of bad pillows). Spa staff were awesome! 2. The Pools--oh my goodness, they are so large and have a water elevator, a little cave system with hidden bar and tables, even a hidden spa somewhere in there. Lots of fun! Unlike the Westin, if you wanted to get away from all the noise that kids make, they have an 18 and over pool in an upper level that is very quiet and relaxing and beautiful as well. There was never a problem in finding lounge chairs. There are teak lounge chairs with thick padding, plastic lounge chairs with older thinner pads and plastic lounge chairs without any padding--lounge chairs are always available. The problem is finding a shaded area. There are only about 8-10 straw thatched umbrellas at the kid/adult pool available free of charge--you'll have to pay for other types of shading ($35 per day for a beach umbrella, $55 per day for a double lounge chair with attached canopy, $135 for a cabana/tent) 3. Drier weather--we got rained 2 of 5 days on in Kaanapali, not at all in Wailea. 4. Location-Wailea is isolated from all the activity and traffic of Lahaina but is only a short walk up a nice little walking trail right next to the Shops at Wailea mall which has stores ranging from a Tiffany's & Gucci to ABC Stores and about 3 or 4 different restaurants in case you don't want to eat at the Grand Wailea. In all, despite the drawbacks, we really enjoyed ourselves and may possibly return if nothing else so that our children (after we have them) can enjoy the pools.", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda Maryland", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Except For The Spa\u201d", "Author": "Bongo1", "ReviewID": "UR5593125", "Content": "Our stay at the Grand Wailea was awful for many of the reasons that others have already posted. Our room smelled foul; the rank odor would not dissipate even when we put the central and ceiling fans on their highest levels. The pools are poorly maintained and dirty. They are infested with teens and teeny boppers and perhaps rightly so because the many slides, water elevator etc seem designed precisely for them. The poolside experience is tolerable if you want a deep tan or sunburn -- you won't get shade for less than $ 55.00 and a cabana is in the $ 200.00 range. The poolside chairs are jammed together like seats at a theater. The hotel's service leaves much to be desired. On four separate occasions I tried to call the front desk no one picked up even after several minutes. The concierge seemed flustered when I asked her to recommend a restaurant that didn't have seafood as its main attraction -- she said that she never ventured out of Keihe. That's an unacceptable answer. The spa was great. I got the best massage of my life there -- ask for Miriam. The hydrotherapy pools are relaxing, but I don't know how hygienic they are. You get a free hour in the pools when you pay for a massage. Before my appointment they had me sit on a terrace with a spectacular view of the ocean and the pools (the pools look much better from a distance) -- very nice. But, all this being said, the spa needs to be rennovated. It's fifteen years old and the wear shows. If you can, stay at the Four Seasons and use the spa at the Grand Wailea. The Four Seasons' service, ambience and poolside set up is far superior to the Grand Wailea's. Their grounds and rooms are also much better and more modern. The Grand Wailea, as its name might suggest, tries to be a spectacle. But it is just oversized, overstated and overrated. This is a hotel on the decline -- a themepark at best.

In the past 4 months my family and I have stayed at Ritz Carlton, the Broadmoor Colorado Springs and the Regent Beverly Wilshire and I can say this place is equally gorgeous. I feel like I can be a picky person and this place fulfilled all my expectations. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. True, it doesn't have the 5 star service of a Ritz Carlton but it was clean and the grounds are kept up very nice. I would just say it reminded me more of a Marriott, Hilton, Sheridan, etc. One thing for sure, this hotel is all about families. The pools are made for kids and parents who want to spend time with their kids. Every kid would love this place. We went over to Four Seasons for dinner at Spago and it was great but then we decided to walk around for awhile. After our little walk we knew we chose the right place to vacation. The Four Seasons was nice but felt like a great place for honeymooners and couples celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. My kids would have NEVER been able to relax there. Anyway, back to Grand Wailea, I thought the food was fine at the restaurants including the Hummahumma (that was actually one of our best meals). The shops on the grounds were fun and convenient as you could run down there from 7 am to around 10 pm and charge it all to the room. I loved The Shops of Wailea next door. It's a close walk and a beautiful shopping area. The beach was perfect. I liked it because it was basically all hotel guests on vacation, not local teenagers hanging out on a public beach. Everything you have heard about the cabanas, chairs, etc. is true. We decided to rent a cabana for every day we were there. If you can do it, it really does make for a more enjoyable afternoon although I did see plenty of people there w/o cabanas and they seemed to look equally as happy. The spa was beautiful. I tried the deep sea facial and it was probably the best facial I have ever had. They offer spa services to kids so my 7 year old daughter had a cocunut/chocolate massage and manicure and pedicure. She really enjoyed it but it seemed like a rip off to me. It just seemed like it went really fast and was over before you knew it. There is a beautiful chapel on the hotel grounds so we decided to attend the Sunday service. If you are into that, I highly recommend it. It really put it all into perspective and reminded me how lucky we were to be sitting there in paradise! We can't wait to get back and as long as our kids our little we would choose the Grand Wailea.

Twice the hotel closed all the restaurants as the hotel for private parties. They really need to make improvements here. Also the room is badly in need of a thoroughly cleaning and updating.

Just like other users here, I have a high calibur of hotels in which I stay in. The Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons are definitely great hotels, but if you are looking for a great time in Maui, the Grand Wailea is by far the way to go. Whether it be for a honeymoon, or for a family trip the Grand Wailea will impress anyone. The hotel is very Hawaiian-esque in its design approach, as you are surrounded by small ponds in the lobby with Hawaiian statues nearby. The rooms have been renovated and are nicely decorated. I would highly recommend getting one with either a Partial-Ocean view or the Ocean View Deluxe room. Considering you have flown all the way to Maui, you might as well get to see the ocean! The hotel also offers a private \"hotel\" within the hotel called the Napua Towers. All the rooms within this section have ocean views and also include a breakfast each morning and drinks throughout the day. It also serves hor d'oeuvre during the afternoon. If you are travelling with a family I would probably opt-out on the Napua Tower as you may want to explore the local restaurants and not be limited to the hotel food. As you may have read in other reviews, the food in this hotel is expensive. Just to make this clear, quality food on the island of Maui is expensive wherever you may choose. One thing I would agree with though is that the hotel food is marginal with the exception of the cafe, Cafe Kula. For kids this place is great and the Volcano Bar near the pools is also convenient yet somewhat pricey. This brings me to one of the highlights of the hotel...the pools! By far this hotel has the best pools for kids compared to surrounding hotels such as the Fairmont at Kea Lani and the Four Seasons. There are many waterslides for kids to enjoy and the world's only water elevator which is an interesting experience. The adult pool is also nice to relax in, and the staff is generally pretty good about keeping it adults-only. The Spa is also another treat while at this hotel. I personally think it is by far one of the best places on the island of Maui for a massage. Now I am sure as you may be reading this you might think, \"this guy has nothing bad to say about the hotel and is biased\" but this is my honest opinion about the hotel. Although I have not yet stayed at the Four Seasons next door, I have stayed at the Fairmont at Kea Lani twice. This hotel definitely has the advantage when it comes to the rooms (as they are actually suites) but considering that I take a family trip, the kids facilities are not nearly as good as the Grand Wailea's. If you are an avid golfer like me, you might also enjoy the convenience of having the 3 Wailea Golf Courses right next to the hotel. The Wailea Blue, Gold, and Emerald courses are all spectacular, and there is a tennis club too that is great.

I had read all of the reviews and was alittle cautious about the reservation and went back and forth onto their own website and even called the hotel to quiet my nerves. Everything faded away when we all arrived at the hotel. The staff was professional and even though we arrived late we were upgraded to an ocean view suite with a larger lanai. If you have children in your family don't hesitate about making the reservations, its so geared to family fun. There are nine separate pools, each connected to the other by these wonderful slides. There is a current in the pools which cascade from one to the other beginning at the top and emptying into the last thru which you go down a rapid like slide. In addition to the nine pools it has a Tarzan rope swing with which you swing and drop into another deeper pool. There are 2 grottos: one with a swim up bar and another thru which you have to go under a waterfall and it leads you to a hot tub. At the top of the pools there is a crazy fast water slide that drops I don't know how many stories but its alot. At the bottom of that pool is a water elevator which takes you up to another super fast slide. There is a baby beach for the little ones and even free scuba diving lessons which my husband took advantage of. I went for a spa treatment one afternoon and the view from the lanai was just to beautiful to put into words. While I was getting myself relaxed and pampered, my son and husband went to the kids activity room and hung out there, where they had video games and such. The beach was just so-so. The real attraction was the pools. As far as getting chairs, we never got up early to get chairs, having read what other travellers did. We found out that the top pool usually had plenty of chairs available at any time in the morning. Since you're in the pools most of the time it never presented a problem to us if their was shade or not. Pool service was nonexistent only if you had reserved a cabana. But again we really spent most of our time in the pool and took advantage of the Volcano Grill. The Cafe Kula on the 4th floor is also great for breakfast and lunch, no crowds. Anyway you slice it, the hotel is expensive but how often do you get an upscale waterpark with an ocean a few steps away, with a spectacular spa. We didn't want to come home! We ate dinner at Longhi's and it was just okay. Spago's at the Four Seasons was worth the money, excellent service and a wonderful meal. We ate dinner at Humuhumu, order the ribs (my son loved them) and the tempura ahi tuna with lemongrass...great appetizer! Everything else was okay. We passed on the luau's, but everyone we asked said the best one is the Old Lahaina Luau, which requires reservations months in advance. If you have younger kids, the height requirement on the slides is 46\" or they will need to go to the baby beach pool. All of the pools are 4ft deep with the exception of the Tarzan pool and the adult pools. Overall service was okay. The hotel was somewhat crowded but never like Disneyland or Sea World kind of crowded. Even though you realized that there were alot of people, somehow their was enough property that you never felt that horrible overcrowded feeling.

Yes, there are some minor flaws, but nothing I experienced merited some of the lambasting reviews posted here, which made me quite nervous, as I had booked the hotel months ago. First off: the rooms are normal. They do not measure up to the standard of the JW Marriott on Oahu, but did not seem inadequate either. Luckily, we were upgraded to the Wailea suite, a large two-bedroom room with a full refrigerator and table. It is worth requesting an upgrade, I can tell you that. The parlor made it hard to leave in the morning. The grounds are filled with tropical gardens which are sprinkled with great works of art, and the grounds don't seem tacky, but like a true tropical paradise, which is lucky because you will be doing a lot of walking. I got lost several times on the first day. The pool is incredible: it consists of several pools linked by tile slides, emptying into a main activity pool, which is rarely crowded. There is a separate adult pool: during my stay, it never had more than 10 people in it. The poolside dining is varied and tasty. There is little shade here, which makes renting a cabana useful, but at $200, it is a bit of a ripoff, even though they do deliver fruit, water, towels, cold towels, frozen grapes, and icepops throughout the day. The pool staff is a bit unprofessional, something not relfected throughout the rest of the resort. Nevertheless, the activity pool (the one with the slides) never felt like a waterpark, but instead like a particularly nice complement to Wailea Beach, the best beach I have ever visited. It has everything: nice sand, equipment rentals, crystal clear water, and even snorkeling in the morning. I recommend going out early just beyond the rocks at the neighboring Four Seasons to see a cornucopia of aquatic biodiversity. One woman spotted a green sea turtle. The beach has waves, which invariably heightened during the afternoon, making for some entertaining waveriding. After an enjoyable day, it would be nice to have a good hotel dinner to look forward to, but the restaurants here fall short, for the most part, of the resort's opulence. Kincha, the japanese restaurant, is the best at the place. HumuHumu was well overpriced, and mediocre. Finally, Bistro Molokini was good for lunch, but had a limited and expensive menu. Most things here are overpriced, even for hawaii, which is my only fault with the place. Room service is always expensive, I know, but a $6 can of soda, an $11 bagel, and the breakfast buffet for $27 (limited selection) all seemed disgustingly overpriced. Wailea in general seems this way. I would recommend a trip to Spago, at the four seasons, for great service and even better food. The golf is also spectacular, and their private lessons are very helpful. For families, or even active adults, the Grand Wiailea seems like the best choice on maui. It is palatial, and grand in every sense of the word. Bottom line, is that the four seasons looked nice, but if the kids in my party ever wandered over the the Wailea activity pool, they would be very jealous. My one regret is not venturing into Lahaina, where the restaurant selection seemed more diverse than on the south side of the island.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5444475", "Content": "Stayed here with my family (all adults) and was pleasantly surprised.

In our opinion, the hotel offered a fabulous setting and good service. It's hard to imagine that we could have done better after touring all of the properties near the Grand Wailea such as the Four Seasons, Fairmont, etc. All of Maui seemed crowded and the GW was no exception. But it didn't seem any more crowded than some of the other places we visited on the island. Here's what I thought: Rooms - We have two teenage sons ages 18 and 13 so we booked two oceanview rooms in the lagoon wing. One king and one double. The rooms were in excellent shape and appeared to be recently renovated. Maid service was great - they did a thorough cleaning job and brought fresh toiletries every day. The beds were pure bliss but I have to say the towels were not of the same quality. That would be the one negative I could find with the rooms. The views were better than I expected and I loved the sliding shutters in lieu of curtains. Rooms were comfortable yet elegant. Pools and Grounds - Breathtaking. The open air lobby is lovely and the lush gardens and landscaping are so beautiful. Pools do not disappoint. We had no problem finding chairs since we weren't looking for shaded areas. The hotel could do a better job of clearing towels in the afternoon but the area was not trashy or rundown as some reviewers have stated. I wish the chaise lounges at the family pool were as nice as the ones at the adult pool. At the adult pool, the service was excellent. No problem getting drinks or food brought to your chair in a timely manner. Ice cold water was provided at the beach and the pool which was nice. The grassy hill facing the ocean was a great way to enjoy the ocean without the sand. The adult pool was magical for a late night swim. Warm and inviting. The temperature of the pools is perfect. I felt somewhat annoyed by all of the guests from The Four Seasons using the pool facilities of the Grand Wailea during the day. I could see why after strolling through their grounds. The pools and facilities at GW far exceed what is offered by the other hotels. Food - We loved having lunch served in the grotto bar behind the waterfall. Not many people realized they would serve food as well as drinks in that area so it was never crowded. The burgers were great and yes they are overpriced but that is to be expected. Kids loved the frozen lemonade and shakes. We were not impressed with room service - the quality of the food was not that great. There is a nice cafe for breakfast and lunch that had takeout pizza which was great for my boys. Breakfast in the main dining room was expensive and just so so although the view is fantastic. I recommend the short walk to Longhi's at the mall instead. We ate their several times and everything was great. I did not care for Cheeseburger at the Shops at Wailea. I thought the hotel did a better burger. At Humu Humu we had a nice dinner but the service was off. I was shocked when they comped our entire meal due to the long delay. We ate most of our dinners off property but generally ate lunch at the hotel almost every day. The best meal of the trip was at Mama's Fish House. A delightful experience with a gorgeous sunset and a charming setting to go along with excellent food. Very expensive even by Maui standards but worth it. Spa - Best spa I have ever visited. Not to be missed for those that enjoy a facial or massage etc. Workout facility was excellent and near empty most of the time. Spa reservations were easy to get. We didn't receive any free upgrades (which would have been lucky) but I booked the hotel knowing it would be expensive so I was not surprised by the resort fees or any of the other prices. The service was very good and the atmosphere of the hotel is simply outstanding. We would love to return but it will probably be a while because of the cost.

Well my family 2 adults and 2 children ages 8 and 10 yrs stayed at the GW for eight days in the delux ocean view room. $510 per night. Check in went well we arrived early and the clerk offered a hospitality suite. Great idea! We ate at the Bistro and food was good but price was high. Once in the room we noticed a great amount of mold around the bathtub and on the grout in the shower. The room size was typical however the view was awesome. Thru our 8 day stay we noticed that the hallway carpet was not vacuumed same debris all week. In addition, room service items glasses, glass ice buckets etc were not picked up for several days. The room 8122 was next to a suite and I have to say it was quiet all nights. A for the pool, great concern for lack of pool personnel to keep area free of garbage and towels left on chairs. Since there was a huge inf lux of people by the pools it was difficult at times to find seating, especially in shade. The pools and theme is the best I have seen for a resort, however, I have to say, I was quite disappointed the type of guest and lack of social ettiquite. At times I felt as though I was at a beer drinkin redneck hillbilly barnyard event. At $510/night I expected a higher social class. The staff failed to demonstrate addressing the over abundance of screaming, running, and rudeness of out of control teenagers. The Wailea beach was perfect and it was a great escape from the waterpark atmosphere. Again it was a disappointment with the lack of cleanliness in the hallways and pool area for the money we were paying. Upon checkout we requested a late departure however, we were told that a VIP was coming into the suite next to our room and our room was part of their party. So as a result, we were unable to get the 4pm checkout. We left our baggage with bellmen and they put our belonings into storage. At the end of the day we were offered a hospiltality suite with a 30 to 45 min usage time. That is good but we really felt rushed into leaving the hotel. I paid my $3500.00 balance in cash and felt as though we are VIP'S too. The staff was not the best in customer service like expected for the money and resort of that stature. M.A. Cave Creek AZ.

Most of the resorts had mixed reviews. Basically the West Coast offers a greater choice of resorts, better restaurants, a lively atmosphere, and more watersports. The South Coast has the more expensive, luxurious resorts, but is closer to the main tours on the island. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we made of our stay there: 1. Location: Good location in Wailea which is a pretty although artificial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresort community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right on the ocean with a nice beach, and lovely backdrop of the Halekala volcanoe. 30 mins drive to airport and the main town which you will drive through (many times!) to get to the main areas of interest on the island. 2. First Impressions: Spectacular entrance with waterfall feature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c friendly and efficient bell service and before you knew it the car was automatically valet parked (for a fee). We were quickly informed that self parking is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca block down the road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but the hotel don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to do this. Got a lei greeting as walked into hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice touch. 3. Check-in: friendly staff who was surprised our room was available at 2pm. We became aware that they stick to the 3pm check-in time as we saw several guests wandering around the resort with their leis on and some baggage waiting for their room. 4. Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very large, spacious, neutral d\u00c3\u00a9cor which we like (not overly tropical). Comfortable bed (similar standard to Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Heavenly bed). Huge lanai \u00e2\u20ac\u201c large enough to seat 4 people to have room service. Massive bathroom with separate shower and bathtub, and good toiletry products. Hard to date the room, as they have kept it fresh and clean, but guess it will be due for a renovation in the next 2 years. Complimentary High speed internet access. Nice view of ocean in the distance, and the resort below. Were on a high floor deluxe ocean view room, of the Wailea wing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the resort has 2 tiers of rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the main tower is higher but set back and and overlooks the resort gardens and the lower tower but this does not obstruct the view. 5. Resort and grounds. They have clearly spent a lot of money over the years on the building, gardens, waterfalls etc and the resort has a bright, airy fresh feel about it. Most areas are open to the outside. It is clean well maintained and has numerous gardens, ponds, sculptures, bridges to wonder about, although these do not compare with the grounds at the Hilton (much smaller \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbut more manicured and in your face here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) 6. Pools: This is where the hotel seriously lets itself down. First impressions are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wow: what an amazing complex \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more like a water park than a resort hotel. Several interconnected pools, lazy rivers, rapids, slides, water elevator. Even has an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadults only pool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. All of these are excellent fun, once you have found a chair! However, big problem is not enough chairs for the number of guests, and so they have crammed in as many as possible in every area. The pool area is poorly managed as they do not discourage you from leaving towels on vacant chairs, do not come around and remove unoccupied towels which would free up many. They hardly have any towel bins, so we actually had to go looking for 10mins to return our pool towels. As a result by 3pm the pool area is messy looking with used towels everywhere. One day at 9:30am we spent 20mins wandering up and down the pools looking for a chair (not a relaxing start) (there were loads of empty ones with towels on them!) Eventually found out from the one and only pool attendant at the desk, you could \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgo get yourself excess loungers and take them to the beach or on the lawn area next to the pool complex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The problem with this is that the chairs were tightly packed in a storage tent, and impossible for an older person to handle. I ended up assisting a couple with their chairs (surely this is what pool attendants should do!) If there are not enough chairs they should set out the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexcess chairs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Every day the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclawn area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was covered in pool chairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this should tell management all they need to know about the pools. Pool service was virtually non-existent. We were offered one drink during our stay which took 30 mins to arrive and was warm. There are not enough servers working a pool this size and they should simply stop it altogether or improve it. Overall if you know what to expect of this resort, and what not, do not mind being overcharged for your stay, do not intend to use the pools, or do mind mind searching or getting up very early, then you will love your stay here. By the way we do not mind paying large amounts for a good resort, and this is a good resort but felt that this was way above resorts of a similar quality on Hawaii.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DALLAS", "Title": "\u201cAwesome place!!\u201d", "Author": "232271", "ReviewID": "UR5351649", "Content": "After reading some negitive reviews, I was worried about the Grand.

What I love most about the Grand Wailiea is the easy access to the beach from the hotel grounds. My nieces, ages 7 and 9, simply decided what they wanted to do first...beach or pool, and we easily went back and forth several times a day. The pool is more of a \"water park\"... two twisting and turning water slides (the tallest being a bit intimidating for the 7 year old), a water elevator, and a long \"river\" that goes downhill from pool to pool to pool...complete with a rapid that gives everyone, even adults, a good dunking! The beach is large, and very peaceful even when crowded. The Grand Wailea has started putting up sun umbrellas (extra charge) in addition to the lounge chairs, so we spent more time on the sand this trip. The water is calm in the morning hours and late afternoon. The biggest surf is always mid-day (12-3). We found it easy to feed the kids for breakfast at the Napua Tower (concierge level), and for lunch at the Lava Bar (by the pool). Service was friendly and accomodating. We are not fans of the GW restaurants. For dinner, we prefer to go next door to the Four Seasons. The food and service is always extraordinary. They have a great children's menu with lots of kid-friendly choices....including numerous side dishes that let them enjoy courses along with the adults. Since I was spending so much time with the kids in the pool, I noticed that I was getting sunburned on my shoulders and face. I suggest buying a visor or hat that can get wet, and a \"rash guard\" shirt that you can put on over your swimsuit. They sell the shirts for kids and adults at the pool area. My feet also became sore walking on the bottom of the pool while pushing the kids (for hours) around the river run. Next time I'm bringng some water shoes. Other reviewers commented on the scarcity of lounge chairs and shade. If you LOVE to be outside by the water like me, do yourself a favor and invest in a cabana or casabella. My husband and I inhabit our cabana (at the adult pool/terrace) all day - from after breakfast until we pull ourselves away in the late afternoon. If money is a concern, I suggest you skimp on the hotel room (e.g. no ocean view), and enjoy the cabana (with wait servie) all day. When we go without the kids, we enjoy the spa, all of the exercise classes, and a daily brisk (or lazy) walk along the entire beach walk fronting all of the hearby hotels. Spa treatments at the Grand Wailea cannot be beat!! The facility is simply the best, and they seem to attract the most talented practitioners in Maui. I also highly recommend the outdoor massage by the adult pool. Sometimes I simply want a massage without all of the water treatments (special baths, sauna, jacuzzi, loofah scrub, etc.) that come with the indoor treatments. I mentioned at the beginning of my comments that we've been to the GW numerous times. We keep returning despite being disappointed by many of the problems noted by other reviewers. However, we have truly found our niche at the GW after so much practice, and we simply overlook or avoid the things we don't like! I think being happy at any hotel depends on whether or not they do best what you like to do. So, I'll review our favorite things below: 1. Setting. You can stay put at the GW. There is plenty to do at the GW and neighboring properties. You never have to drive anywhere. (If you like to stock up on supplies for the room I suggest stopping at the Safeway grocery store off the main highway on your way to Wailea. Also, the shopping mall next door to the GW - yes, a real mall - has everything you need from toothpaste to designer clothing, handbags and jewelry.) In previous trips to Maui I have done all of the tourist attractions. I recommend biking down the volcano. You can be picked up from your hotel for this attraction. 2. Easy access to the beach from the hotel grounds. You simply walk straight from the resort to the beach. And what a beach! Long and wide...great for taking long walks back and forth, and safe for swimming. I'm not into snorkeling off the beach. I suggest taking a boat trip to somewhere great like Molokini. 3. Cabanas. I love having a private area near the pool and beach where we can leave our stuff all day, enjoy wait service and lunch, read, close the curtains and nap, and have protection from the sun. 4. The spa. We always enjoy a few treatments during our stay, usually after a long day outdoors and before dinner. I've NEVER had a bad massage...just some that were more spectacular than others. Request Miriam and an \"outside\" treatment room. These are rooms that have windows, allowing you to enjoy the sounds of the fountains and the ocean breeze. 5. Breakfast at the Napua Tower. I do NOT enjoy stuffing myself at breakfast, and I hate waiting in long lines to eat. We have settled into the Napua Tower after discovering how much we benefit from their complimentary breakfast service (from 7 to 10 am). I like their afternoon open-bar and appetizers, however, we usually miss it since we are still outside enjoying the pool or beach. 6. Exercise classes. I think the classes have become less interesting over the years. However, they do have offerings every day and a variety during the week, plus they have a gym with all the necessary equipment. So, no excuse for not getting in a good work-out. If you are brave...try the spin class. 7. Eating next door at the Four Seasons. We especially love Ferraro's and the Pacific Grill. The Grill is more casual, and we go there several times each stay. If you are eating on the cheap, just plan to have dessert and coffee at Ferraro's one night, under the stars, accompanied by guitar and violin. Try to arrange for a table for two overlooking the beach. 8. The pool. Just a kid at heart, I guess, but I get a real kick out of the slides and river run. And, I love seeing all of the other kids-of-all-ages laughing and squealing as they enjoy it as well. Hope this helps you enjoy your stay at the Grand Wailea.

Rooms- phone so dusty I wouldn't pick it up, ceiling fan full of dust, sliding doors so dirty I wouldn't touch them. I used an anti bacterial wipe on them and they came clean. Light switches dirt marks again cleaned myself, mildew in shower, a piece of something hanging off the wall still there when I left (room 6073). The sheets had a stain on them and were so worn that they had stubbies on them that hurt when rubbed against the skin. When I called to have these replaced I received a very cold response. At the Hyatt after a guest vacates a room it is dusted right up to the ceiling fan. This hotel needs to clean better after a guest leaves. Don;t waste your money on an ocean view room, the rooms that are garden level behind the pool area are in a great location, close to everything. Staff- For an expensive hotel the staff are horrible except for the restaurant staff, and the beach area staff. I had a problem with a rat outside my door. Yes a big old rat who wasn't afarid of me. Needless to say I put my suitcases in front of the door so he couldn't get in the bottom space. I let the front desk know because I felt that they needed to contact there pest control and let them do something about it. As I was speaking with a gentleman a young lady interrupted the converstaion to tell me that I didn't see a rat it was a cat! My nerves being shot at the time I informed her that I do know the difference between a cat and a rat and I saw a rat. I continue talking with the gentleman and again the peanut gallery decides I saw a mongoose not a rat, and again I informed her the it was a rat not a mongoose. She then proceeded to shake her head and act like I was nuts. I'm sorry but I do not want to see a rat outside my 700 door. I understand theres a problem with rats in Hawaii I just do not want to see it or be told I'm really seeing a cat or a mongoose instead of the rat I saw. Food Tthe breakfest buffet is terrible compared to the Marriott and the Hyatt. Food sits out with flys etc but the waitress was nice . I think it ws Mulligans where I really enjoyed the food Don't do the package deal with breakfest we did it and the waiter didn't realize and gave us a bill for 30 cheaper then what we had to pay. The he took it back when we told him and we go the higher bill Pools Adult pool is really hot and in need of major repairs. Its not just a few tiles ,its alot and it should be in great condition. theres no reason for poor maintence like that. If I wanted to sit in a pool with tiles missing I would've sat in my own pool thats scheduled for repairs for the missing, broken or mildew tile. The amount of chairs and places to sit were fine, however they were doing construction down by the rope swing and they had that part roped off. The beach was great except that need a waitress on it for drinks and food.

We did not read the reviews before we went because we received the trip as an incentive package from one of the vendors from our heating & air conditioning business on the east coast of US. In response to reviews we read after returing home to write a review I offer the following: We though the place was fantastic. The grounds in our opinion were beautiful. Our oceanview room was spacious with standard ammenties that we would expect at this level of resort. Large soaking tub and seperate shower for two, seperate toilet room, sitting area in room, desk with high speed internet, lani with seating. The room was comfortable, bedding was fine, no noise from outside. Maid service was fine. The pool area was busy, I did not want a cabana but if I would have I would has planned in advance. We travel alot, usally in 4 star plus accommadations, in doesn't make any difference how much you pay there are allways people that don't know how to conduct themselves. Every time we went to the pool there were no \"open\" chairs. This day and age even with the hotel claiming they watch for unused but \"saved\" chairs you have to take matters into your own hands. If there were just towels, not personal items, we pitched them in the used towel bin and replaced them with clean ones. Big deal, if some one presented themselves stating that the chairs were theirs and we had been there the hotels limit of one hour we would tell them that the hotel cleared their towels, go speak to someone with the hotel as we are using the chairs and are not leaving. No one ever presented themselves. Many reviews stated about things being run down, yes our room could have been touched up where people knocked their luggage in to the wall, but who cares about a few of the million plus pool tiles being broken. The hotel was hosting a group of 750 from Sprint also when we were there (4/23 to 4/29). Someone claimed they over booked and paid them to move to another hotel but allowed them to use the facilities. They put some Sprint folks up next door at the Four Seasons. Some of the people from other hotels using the Grand's pool were authorized but I am sure there were some ousiders also. The hotel actually gives a wrist band to help keep unauotherized folks out, good luck pool police ! Yes everything is expensive at the Grand, and in Hawaii in general. One person complained that the resturants were so expensive that they were eating PBJ sandwich's to get by. What did they expect? They should do a little more research befor they book next time. We ate at the fancy \"HunHun\", of something like that, one night, expensive yes, food was excellent, service was okay, waitress had zero personality, never did return to see if everything was okay. We have had better service in a $5.00 a plate diner, or a $100.00 a plate fine dinning place, but we have also had the worst service possible in both of these extremes. You could blame the hotel for employing them but, when you look a the housing and wage difference in Hawaii It's a wonder to me that they can have enough people to serve us travelers who invade their homeland and expect everyone to bow to them because we have enough money to get there!

This concerns mainly their reservations department. First of all, I am getting married there next year. We are paying $3500 for an hour and a half of just using the chapel that is on their grounds. Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful location and very exquisite chapel (the ONLY reason I decided to get married their after bad service). I'm not having my reception there because they refused to allow my party any ballrooms to hold it in. They say they don't do reservations for weddings over a year in advance so when we went there exactly a year before the date, they said the ballrooms were all booked. Apparently they book conventions over a year in advance. Hmmmm, seems a little hypocritical. Besides they didn't give me a flat out \"no\", they told me \"wait and we'll see what we can do\". They left me hanging for over a month before I got impatient and decided to look for a location elsewhere. Anyway that isn't the end of my bad experience. OK, so now I need to get a room to stay there before and after the wedding. I call reservations 10 months in advance. The person on the phone tells me flat out \"no rooms available\". I tell them I'm getting married at their hotel, can't they do anything? Answer: Nope. They don't offer a waiting list or even pretend to check their computers. The reason I wanted to make the reservations over the phone is because they are supposed to give a 20% discount to people who get married there. And this reservations fiasco doesn't stop here! My fiance tried again a couple months later to phone in reservations. They told him their computers was down so call a week later and they will get hima suite! He calls back to get the same message I previously got, \"no rooms available\". He told them the person he spoke to said he could get a suite and that the computers were down before. The receptionist told him there were no problems with the computers! Anyway, if customer service is important to you, do not stay at the Grand wailea.

We decided to switch resorts from the Ritz Kapalua for the better weather and pool at the GW. Compared to the Ritz, the GW offers some advantages and disadvantages. The pool is definitely a plus. Very large with multiple areas - several water slides including a few short ones that I had felt were safe enought to carry my baby on. There is even a rope swing which is a blast! The water is heated and warm compared to the Ritz which does not heat the water. This turned out to be key for my daughter, who felt much more comfortable in the GW pool. The toddler pool section is nice - clean sandy bottom and graduated depths just like the beach. Several waterfalls that you can swim under and a swim-up bar too. I do agree with other reviewers in that the pool side can be a bit crowded, although I never had a problem finding suitable spots to recline, even with 90-100% capacity in the hotel. Also, there is definitely a lack of shady spots - we dealt with that by renting a \"casabella\" a partially covered pair of cushioned, wooden beach recliners that were located between the pool and beach for $55 per day- not cheap but less expensive than a cabana. Compared to Kapalua, Wailea weather is also nicer - warmer, less windy and drier. This was the main reason we cut our stay short at the Ritz, so I'm glad we moved. Also, wailea is more convenient with a medium size higher-end mall 5 min away and kihea town 10 min away with more reasonable restaurants. at the Ritz we needed to drive further for this - Kaanapali was about 15-20 min away. The grounds at the GW are very nice - expansive, well maintained and lush with several koi ponds with clear water. The lobby is impressive with a large central bar (classy and not noisy) in the center of a pool with sculptures. The beach also is close by and pleasant - gentle waves and good for wading and swimming. The snorkeling is mediocre however - living coral out near the rocks but not a lot of variety and quantity of fish. Also, when I stayed the winds picked up in the afternoon, creating white caps on the ocean and making snorkeling/swimming less attractive. Compared to the Ritz, the food at GW is also overpriced (not surprising). There is a bit more variety at the GW, with a small market/cafe that offers relatively reasonable meals (granola, pastries, breakfast burritos, sandwiches, ice cream, pizza etc) that the Ritz did not offer - we frequented this venue the most as we were a bit tired of the $26 breakfast buffet and $25 lunch entrees at the Ritz. We did try the GW breakfast buffet once and were disappointed - the quality of food paled in comparison w/ the Ritz. Service at the GW was mediocre. I felt that the staff was far less personal, attentive and concerned for my needs than the Ritz. For example, I checked in early before my room was ready, the front desk person didn't bother to tell me that I could use a hospitality room, despite knowing that I needed to change. I found this out by asking the bellhop later, but this required me to get back in line again to ask the front desk for the room key - a slight but noticeable inconvenience. Also, when I was at the pool bar, the bartender seemed miffed that I added on an additional drink after paying for my initial order. I believe this lack of service is is partly due to the size and huge numbers the staff must deal with, but for the price I paid, I feel I should have gotten friendlier, more considerate service. I also was not overly impressed with my room. Admittedly, I asked for the cheapest one available ($371) which needed to be quiet as I'm a lighter sleeper. The room was decent in size and much cleaner than the Ritz. The location was indeed quiet - facing the mountains (away from the bar/restaurants and pool), but a large generator (AC?) was close by near the self-prking lot and hummed 24 hours - too loud to keep the window open at night - a slight inconvenience. Also, the grout of the bathroom tile was old and stained from mildew - not bad but a little gross and unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. Perhaps if I paid more I would have gotten a better/cleaner bathroom. Overall, I would recommend staying at the GW for the huge pool with many water features (slides, swing rope, heated water, toddler section) especially if you are traveling with kids. Just don't expect exceptional service from the staff despite the price you will pay. I am told the Hyatt Kaanapali has a nice pool too, but the GW pool is probably the best on Maui. If the pool isn't as important I would recommend staying somewhere else in Wailea. The Fairmont Kea Lani (where I stayed for my honeymoon) is quite nice, for example.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miller Place, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood time\u201d", "Author": "tddn", "ReviewID": "UR4998091", "Content": "Stayed April 14-18.

Had garden room with bkfst for 2. Room by chapel & had beach ocean views as well as ponds around hotel. Room was large as was bathroom. Pools are very crowded everyone ignores rule of pool opening at 7 (I heard many saying they are down at 6) & hotel doesn't follow thru on removing items left before 7 or during day for more than hour. They do need more people working at pool. Unfortunately alot of people seem to think since they are on vacation they may be slobs. (or are they always slobs?) People just get up leave all their towels & garbage laying around, therefore if you are looking for a chair you think someone is using these chairs. Why can't people return towels or at least make a pile on one chair for towel boy(when he's around) to collect? And throw away their garbage? You see a big variety of people, will wonder how some can afford to stay. At one point went to ladies room & 2 women had stripped down in sink area to put on suits, if this wasn't bad enough later they were stading on bridge over pool screaming at the top of their lungs to people on other side! Everyone was staring. As for pool kids loved the slides they were disappointed with the 7.2 million dollar elevator.It gets very hot around pool, not enough shade. Also people from Four Seasons come to sit at pool because they don't like pool there which causes more crowding.

We are actually \"life members\" which meant we paid the hotel a \"entry fee\" (multiple Ks) to become members. Unfortunately in the last two times, it pains me to have to write this review and mention that we have been disappointed with the service, and many other things. The hotel used to be Japanese owned, then got sold and managed by KSL Resorts (Arizona Biltmore, Hotel Coronado, etc.) The service went from really good to good. Unfortunately, although the service was good, the resort (aside from the rooms) have been left to show its age. No attention to details, it was clear that KSL was in it for money not service and experience. The mini mosaic tiles of the swimming pool have started to should mold, many of them are missing, the tiles from the \"Grand Wailea\" mosaic in front of Spa Grande are chipped and haven't been replaced in the last 1-2 years. Most of the wooden chairs around the pool haven't been treated with wood protection in years (they all look faded). This year, we learned that Hilton's \"Waldorf Astoria\" collection (which is a fancy name for not Hilton but not 5 star either) took over the management of the hotel. Now the service went from good to bad. Here are a few sample experiences: - at HumuHumunukunukuapua'a - one of the restaurants there - we came at 8pm to see if there was room - we were greeted by a hostess that clearly was overwhelmed by only two small groups that came without reservations - rather then arranging seating for us, she started to say \"I don't how we are going to do this, these people came there are 4 of them, then these people (my wife and I) came as well, and also don't have a reservation\". After 5 mins, managed to find us a seat. Then the waitress was definitely sub-par. She attended to us for the first 60% of our dinner and then clearly was gone after that. We found her chit-chatting with other waiters. We had to ask the bus boy for her twice, got our coffee from the bus boy and our check from him again. - At the beach, there were 8-10 umbrellas to rent for a resort of 780 rooms, that was a bit thin. All of them were taken for the day - bad planning on the resort's management. When asked multiple times for umbrellas or \"cabanas\" on the beach that seemed to be have emptied, we were told off and said \"sorry even though the people have left\" we can't rent them to you . - At the beach again, there was a loud siren which sounded like a warning for something like a tsunami or fire. After we asked what it was, two younger staff joked around that it was because of a shark, and then said that it was indeed for a test of the tsunami alert system - not a laughing matter - really. - At Kincha, the Japanese restaurant there. We had one waitress, and two waiters offer us drinks, which was great and then they all disappeared. Once we had waived two to three times we were able to get someone's attention. - At multiple occasions during lunch or at multiple places on the resorts, staff were playing or joking around so much so that they would interrupt most people's conversations - not really \"five star\" at all where staff are supposed to be present but unnoticeable. Otherwise, the hotel's pricing has gotten from bad to worse. The rooms are now close to $750-850 for a full ocean view. The cabanas around the pool are $225 per day.

Get your wrist band and towels from the pool kiosk. The water elevator is OK but you only need to do it once. The lazy river and slides are great fun, but again we only did them once. We snorkelled off the beach, but didn't see much. Heard the whales though! We had a massage at the spa plus the hour beforehand in the different baths - very relaxing. Our trips out included a helicopter tour, whale watching cruise, ATV at Haleakala Ranch, sunrise at Haleakala crater (we drove ourselves - left GW at 4.30, sunrise 6.35, back for breakfast by 10) and snorkel trip to Molokini and turtles with Kai Kanani off the beach at Maui Prince hotel (10 mins from GW).

The resort is really beautiful just as almost everyone has already posted. The only issue I had, but it is a personal one, is that the place is just so darned big!!! No location is ideal as far as rooms go. We were in room 6085 and although we were a short walk from the meeting rooms, ballroom and nightclub, it was a hike down to the pool, gym or spa. If you forgot something in your room and needed to go back it was a huge inconvenience. Anyway, on with the review...our check in went smooth and besides the fact that there were no rooms with king sized beds left (heard that complain alot on this board) there were no other problems. Our room, although starting to get a bit outdated, was clean and was kept that way throughout our stay. We were with a large group and had many arranged meals that were paid for by the company which helped out alot because the food at the resort was on the pricey side but certainly no more than any other resort of that type. Yes, drinks at the pool were $10 a pop but coming from the NY area its nothing that I am not used to. We did eat at the breakfast buffet one morning and found it to be very good but once again, it wasnt cheap. We had lunch almost every day out at the pool and found the food to be about average....burgers,wraps etc... The pool itself was very nice, clean, etc.. There were not too many kids there so we spent most of our time at the main pool area. The adult (Hibiscus) pool was a bit too quiet for me. My spa massage was wonderful and I must say worth every penny. I have been to many spas all over the world and found that one to be by far the best. If you are headed there dont miss it!! All in all, my experience at the Grand Wailea was very nice but I would not go back simply because I prefer a smaller resort.

When we arrived at the very roomy suite, we realized that there was no ocean view-- the only view was of the gardens and someone's discarded underwear in the bushes in front of our lanai. Management was unwilling to move us to an ocean front room in this section, but rather downgraded us to a \"partial\" view- at the same rate- no concessions! The rooms are average in size and decently appointed for a supposed five star resort. The food continues to be severely over priced- hamburgers $14, hot dogs $12, fruity drinks $9... all served with an attitude that is not Hawaiian.

We did not spend a fortune for breakfast eating at the buffet with children who usually just want some cereal or a muffin. It was open late so you could get chips and sodas or snacks to take to the room. As for poolside service, very slow. The spa was one of the best I have ever been too! It is worth every penny. The amenities in the room are from the spa and we loved the soap so much, we bought some to take home with us. There is a walkway from the hotel to the Wailea shopping area which took about 5 minutes or less to walk to and was a nice break.

Housekeeping was kind enough to leave many bottles of water (not charged on my mini bar bill) and plenty of toiletries, all which smell like heaven. A problem with my toilet was fixed within twenty minutes of when I called. The bartender at HumuHumu was delightful and refused to let me pay for my drinks. Room service was prompt and delicious, and always double checked if you tipped over to make sure you knew that tip was included. The spa exceeded all expectations. I went each day of my trip and enjoyed the hydrotherapy terme before hand. All of my services(thai massage, crystal energy massage, shiatsu massage, volcanic ash facial, etc) were far above avaerage, and I was lucky enough to get some of the best employees. I got to know all of the spa staff by name and was treated supremely. All of my needs were anticipated. After completeing a massage one day, I was relaxing by the sauna. My terme attendant, noticed that I was chilly came and wrapped me in towels and spritzed my face with aromatherapy spray. While I soaked during my bath, the attendant braided my hair. After talking to the staff, I began to notice a pattern. Everyone I spoke with had worked at the hotel for years. No one in the spa has been there for less than two years and most had been there ten or more. You can always judge an establishment by how they treat their employees, and the Grand clearly cares not only about their geusts happiness.

We were booked in an ocean view room on the 8th floor of the Molokini Wing, which conveniently is the closest wing to the Makena self-parking garage. This worked out very well for us, eliminating a $14/day charge for valet parking without introducing an unbearable commute. Our room was of adequate size with a very large and nicely appointed bathroom. The room had a late 1980s feel to it; with obvious worn areas around the carpet, wallpaper, and bathroom shower tile. The wear was minor and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite warrant a room renovation, but in a few more years it will probably need a facelift. We also noticed a very slight musty odor in the room, likely due to so many beach-goers returning to their carpeted rooms while still wet. An air freshener we purchased at Longs Drugs made short work of that. We rented a mini-fridge from the resort for $25 and used it to store milk, yogurt, and other baby essentials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very worthwhile.

DO expect only average to above average rooms and service. DO expect to pay $12.00 for a pina colada. DO expect a mandatory 21% gratuity AND service charge on room service orders. Finally, DO expect to see a lot of families and younger people whose clothes, behavior, and mannerisms; I am sure; will cause you to wonder how they can afford to spend $500-$1000/night on a hotel room. If you think that spending $500/night on a hotel room is enough to isolate you from kids and seemingly middle-class travelers...you will be disappointed.

The rooms are good sized but not enormous. It would take about 10 minutes and two elevators to get from our room to the pool, so we had to think about whether we really needed to go from the pool back to the room for that little something we'd forgotten. This is important to keep in mind if you have a disability or difficulty walking great distances. Pros: Vast and beautiful grounds, many pools, waterslides and other water features to keep the kiddies entertained. You never really feel crowded though the complex is very large. There's a tiny chapel for weddings or vow renewals. A separate, adults-only pool allows you to escape the kiddie-generated noise and activity. The high prices keep out the frat boys and graduation celebrators. The clientele seemed to be mostly families. Activities. Just a few: fish feeding (not to be missed, kids loved it), garden tour, free yoga though you pay for other gym classes, a lovely but pricey spa, squash court. This place has everything and you'd need weeks to really take advantage of all it has to offer. Surroundings: Wailea is not as built up as other parts of this side of the island. There are some great isolated beaches a few minutes' drive away, and turtles off the hotel beach. A very quiet area, no traffic or partying noise. It seemed that all rooms may be ocean-view, though I can't be sure. Cons: Extremely expensive and you're reminded of it constantly. The mini-fridges in the rooms are sealed shut, if you break the seal you have to pay, so there's no way to store drinks or food. A small bottle of water in the room costs over $6. Apart from very high food prices, there are daily resort fees, parking fees, gym class fees, cabana fees, etc. You really feel that at every turn they're squeezing the last drop out of you, which is not conducive to relaxing while on vacation. Apart from the hotels' boutiques, it's a 15-minute walk to the closest shops, which are in an upscale mall. If you need anything you'll pay through the nose there too. You must have a car to be able to go into Kihei to a grocery store if you need anything or to eat anywhere outside a hotel or the mall, which only has expensive restaurants. The hotel is very large and service is anonymous -- cheerful but not excellent. Because it is so big, things like valet parking can take a while. They do a good job at not letting you feel crowded, but this is not the place for anyone looking for personalized service or an intimate hideaway. There is a great deal of seeing and be seening and networking around the pool. The kids' pools and waterslides are like a water park. Four Seasons is a short walk away, we ate there twice and it had a more discreet feel. The Grand Wailea is flash, while the Four Seasons seemed more sedate, though I didn't see the rooms.

The bad reviews were simply wrong. Stayed at the Grand Wailea the Saturday after Thanksgiving for 2 nights and then was supposed to stay at the Four Seasons for six nights. We checked out of our room and went to the Four Seasons to check in but when we were brought to our \"Prime Ocean View Room\" we were very disappointed. After looking at several rooms at the 4S and not being happy, I called the Grand Wailea and asked if we could be put back in our Deluxe Ocean View Room, 9034, for the rest of our stay, another 6 nights and we were accommodated. I am so glad they did. We were on the 9th floor of the Wailea Wing at the Grand Wailea and the room and view were spectacular. Ocean, mountain and resort views from way up. What turned out to be really nice was our lanai didn't get the hot sun directly on it during the day and was always comfortable for reading and relaxing at any time day or night. What I also loved about the room was that the bed, a king bed in our room, faced the lanai and ocean so that when you opened the doors in the morning you could sit in bed and look directly at the ocean and the view and it was magnificent. That is one of the things I did not like about the 4S. Our \"prime\" ocean view room had a bed that faced the TV and the entry to the bathroom. You had to sit up and crane your neck to the side to even see the view and really only could enjoy the view if you were on the lanai. Once on the lanai the view was spectacular but I didn't plan on sitting out there all the time. I also found the room to be dated. Our room at the Grand Wailea was not musty as others have written but was terrific. It was right around the corner from the elevator and very convenient. The resort was terrific. Everyone was very helpful. We had no issues about lots of kids but also spent most of our time at the adult pool and rented a cabana. It is an added expense of $150 a day but worth it. You can typically have 2 chairs outside the cabana to sit in the sun and then use the cabana to just relax, read, nap and take it easy while enjoying a beautiful, relaxing view of the ocean. You can reserve a cabana but typically cannot reserve one specific cabana although all at the adult pool seem to have a great view. I think we had cabana K. You get lots of water and a fruit plate during the day. People have complained on this site that the additional charge for the cabana was annoying and was included at the 4S and not extra. While that may be true you also have to figure in that a comparable room at the 4S is also more expensive. I do agree that the resort fee per day is a bit much as well as valet parking, but that now is also a cost at the 4S as well. The Grand Wailea spa was also one of the best I have been to and I have been to a number of spas. The waiting area on the lanai has chaise lounges looking right through the fountains to the ocean. It's beautiful to relax there while waiting for a treatment or even afterwards. We had the romantic interlude with a sandlewood wrap, bath and then massage which was icing on the cake after enjoying the terme hydrotherapy (several baths you can enjoy beforehand, where you can also use steam and sauna and they give you a complimentary scrub before your treatment - you can spend one hour there before any treatment). The spa at the Grand Wailea is one that absolutely should not be missed. I also enjoyed the food, found Humu's to be very nice and the Molokini Bistro also nice. Kincha was also nice. Did not like Cafe Kula but did enjoy the breakfast buffet or off the menu and the view from that restuarant is also excellent. Room service was good. Was the food spectacular, probably not but it was very good. The resort is very large and so you do a lot of walking. You can go off the resort to eat, can walk to the four seasons along the beach and go to spago's which we found very nice. The prices in the stores were also good. We had seen a pair of Tommy Bahama swim trunks in Lahaina marked way up. The store at the Grand Wailea had the same trunks at their normal price, much lower than Lahaina. I also bought a bathing suit at the hotel when mine tore that was also reasonably priced. I did have a dispute regarding our bill at the time of checkout which soured the experience somewhat but I was contacted by a manager who resolved the situation to my satisfaction which was greatly appreciated. We had no problems with the valet and used our car to go to Lahaina to see Annabelle and Warren's which I did not enjoy the appetizer/drink thing beforehand. Very boring. If you go at all, only go to the magic show which is simply what it is, a magic show......Loved the Festival at Lele, good food and great show but also booked really early and had a front row table right in front of the stage.... Ali'i Nui for snorkeling is a must. Great catamaran that is not too crowded. As we left, saw one of the more touristy boats just jammed with people. Yes, we paid a little more to be on the Ali'i Nuii but when you spend hours on the boat, what is another 30-60 dollars for 2 people for more room and better service. Lastly, if go to the Big Island, that Four Seasons, unlike Maui, was absolutely superb and I would recommend that as well, you will not be disappointed.

This hotel had everything that I could have wanted in a beachfront hotel. After a long day of travel, we were greeted by cheerful attendants that leid us as bellmen wisked away our luggage. The front desk was also quite welcome- upgrading us to a deluxe garden room along a quiet wing of the hotel. As the bellman took us to our room, he gave us a great tour of the hotel and we took in the grounds as best we could in the middle of the night. Our room was fantastic, with a huge terrace and an amazing bathroom with whirlpool and stall shower. They say garden view, but in a rare bit of humility (a rare thing in the hotel business), this room had garden, ocean and mountain views. In the morning, we paroused the grounds and my suspicions were confirmed- the inky darkness that we looked out on the previous night was a paradise come morning. I really enjoyed this hotel because of the SCOPE of the hotel. It is a large hotel, but never did we feel cramped or inindated with noise. It had cuisine ranging from a simple breakfast place to get pastries to fine dining- it had pool areas for families AND adults. This hotel had taken into consideration EVERYONE that visited it. Whether you wanted a $10 or a $40 breakfast, whether you wanted to play in the family pool on the slide complex (do it at least once, its that impressive) or slip into the quiet hibiscus pool with a drink and a private cabane waiting for you when you get out, this place was perfect. *****- a wonderful combination in a package that doesnt overwhelm, the Grand Wailea is a keeper, and should be higher on this list of Maui's best hotels.

We stayed 4 nights in December and were apprehensive after reading all the reviews and were torn between the Kei Lani, 4 Seasons but the Wailea was a little more reasonable price wise. The resort is very grand/large and it was a \"haul\" from our room to the adult pool everyday. A 10 minute brisk walk each way, so you really made sure you brought everything you needed. We ate at Humuhumu and loved it, it was our anniversary and upon check in the front desk gave us a certificate for a free bottle of champagne at any resort restaurant. Valued per the menu at $45. We had lobster bisque and seared tuna and shrimp and loved it all. The resort was 40% occupied at our time of stay Dec 11-15 so we got great service and great seats - we could see all the fish in the lagoon swimming around. There is definitely pool chair anxiety at the adult pool which is where we camped daily. People come out at 7:00 am claim chairs to show up at 12:00 and after. The resort should remove belongings and let others use chairs that are \"saved\". I happen to get down early at 8:00 and read and hang out but I felt for those who were chairless and had to go to another pool because of hogs. The room was nice, nothing really fabulous but nice. The spa was absolutely fabulous and I would definitely recommend it. I was just at the Peninsula in downtown Chicago which paled in comparison to this grand place and the most amazing sports massage by Joette from Glen Ellyn, IL. The baths and hot tubs are great and very relaxing. We did have great pool service daily, Jaimie was terrific. Perhaps they only have service at the adult pool, not sure. We did go wandering to the kids pool and spend a couple hours everyday in the slides and lazy river. Water is a great temp and it is a lot of fun. The grotto bar in the pool is the best, Richard the bartender has good tips on meals and things to do. We took the helicoper ride via Sunshine Co ($600) for the two of us and well worth it. Could see Hana and parts of Maui you cannot travel to easily on foot. Great waterfalls and views. Go early in the morning though as it is clearer and wear dark shirt as the glare of your shirt will mess up photos. It is an addt upgrade to get front row (next to pilot) we didn't but wish we did. Kind of a once in a lifetime thing...at least for us. We did get upgraded from Mountain view to Garden room upon request at check in. I think we would have been really bummed with Mountain as it looks like townhouses are going up and it would be loud. Our room was super quiet and was concerned initally after reading reviews that the tile hallways were loud with wheelie bags day and night. Our hall was carpeted and we never heard anyone at all. The grounds are fabulous and we did venture to the Kei Lani and the 4 seasons and I would really be freaked at the limited chairs at the 4 seasons, people were on top of their neighbor so to speak, all yapping on phones....nightmare if you ask me.

I'm a frequest visitor to Maui (twice a year or so) and ususally stay at the Hyatt over on Kaanapali. This time I decided to split my time and try the Grand Wailea out and I think I found my new home in Maui. Pros: Grounds are immaculate. Everything is well kept and the lobby is gorgeous. The pool is awesome! Almost makes you forget about the beach! (but see below). The rooms were nice as well (but see below again). Staff was awesome as I was upgraded to a full ocean view without charge---of course I went during a slow week so dont think this is common. The Spa was amazing!! We used the gym first (free) and then got a couples massage. Never been to a spa before so maybe I'm not the best person to be rendering an opinion as to the spa, but I thought it was great. Cons: The rooms are nice, but are not what you'd expect for paying $450+ a night. Yes its clean, but nothing fancy. You dont walk in and say \"whoa!\" Bathroom was nice, but again the tile looks dated. The poolside service is obsolete. If you dont have the prime seating, you'll get ignored. We had to serve ourselves. They need the lounge chairs at the Princeville were you raise a flag when you need service. While I loved the pool, I could see how it would get annoying to adults and people who want to unwind. I was there during the off-season and the pool was swarmed with kids. I didnt care though, but some people might. Also, the pool got pretty crowded and so I can only imagine what its like during xmas and summer. The price of everything is obvioulsy high and you shouldnt be surprised given the fact that 1) you're in maui and 2) you're at the GW. If you can afford to stay here, you probably can afford an $8 oreo shake. Lastly, while we didnt dine at the restaurants much, we did have the breakfast buffet. Sadly, it stinks. The food is ok and the selection is mediocre, but what was awful was the fact that its an open air restaurant meaning bugs are flying around.

So while it seems like the cons outnumber the pros, its only because people care more about the cons then the positives. I'll definitely stay here again and again and again.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "folsom", "Title": "\u201cSolid Vacation Resort (Detailed Review)\u201d", "Author": "folsomplanner", "ReviewID": "UR4244623", "Content": "Aloha, My family (Mom, Dad, 8 yr old, and 4 yr old) and I just returned from a one week (December 3rd through 10th) stay at the Grand Wailea with our neighbors. We have previously stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea so we had a pretty good perspective on what to expect. Overall, we had a great time at the Grand Wailea and it is an excellent resort in a fantasic location on Maui. I have given a more in depth review below for those planning on a vacation here. Resort Grounds/Setting: The word \"Grand\" is appropriate for this resort, the resort is very large and spread out, which is nice considering there are over 800 guest rooms. The lobby area has fantastic artwork and is open and airy, allowing the ocean breezes to flow through. Bring your walking shoes, it does take some time to walk from your room to the main lobby, or to the pool, or to the beach, or to dine. The grounds are very well kept, considering the scale of the resort. The pool area is excellent, especially for children. There are six or seven pool areas you can set up camp and let the kids play. The \"Water Elevator\" is a little overblown, and cost 1.2 million dollars to build as they will tell you everytime you go in it. The beach in front of the Grand Wailea is one of the best on Maui, or in Hawaii in my opinion. Very fine sand, very few rocks or seaweed, big enough waves to boggie board but not too large to scare the children. Rooms: We had a room on the third floor of the southernmost wing (Cheap Rooms) of the hotel. We had a nice view of the mountains and the Four Seasons Resort to the south. The cheap rooms at the Grand Wailea have a much better view than the cheap rooms at the Four Seasons by the way. The room was a good size (650 SF +/-) and had a decent sized outdoor balcony area. The decor and maintainance of the room was just adequate, it could have used some updating. Some of the wallpaper was peeling a bit, and some of the rug areas were worn. The bathroom was very large, a little smaller than the four seasons, the bathroom also could have used a little updating but was acceptable. Service: This service at the Grand Wailea is just ok, not bad, not great. My main comment here is that with a resort of this size, it it difficult to provide top quality service. In my opinion, they are understaffed, especially around the pool areas. I should note that the resort was very quiet when we were they, some of their staff mentioned that during Thanksgiving and Christmas the resort is a real zoo. So if the service is a little suspect when the resort is quiet, I can only imagine what it would be like when the resort is busy. On a service note, we visited the Four Seasons on a few occasions to shop, eat, etc, and the service was perfect. Food: Food and dining is the one area where I feel the Grand Wailea needs to improve. We had meals at Bistro Molikini, Cafe Kula, and Humuhumu...The Bistro Molikini is a nice place for lunch, the good was pretty good and the atmosphere was nice. Cafe Kula was a good place to pick up snacks and nick-nacks, more of a cafe type setting. Humumum... was a disaster, the setting is nice with a pond surrounding the restaraunt, but the service and the food were poor. The place was absolutely dead at night, very little activity. A resort of this size needs to focus more on dining options for its guests. We did dine out at some nice places including Ruth's, Tommy Bahamas, Spago, Roys, and Ferraros, but none of these are on the hotel grounds. Roy's in Kehei at the Safeway Shopping Center is about a ten minute drive from the Grand Wailea. Roys is a top notch restaraunt and a must eat-at place everytime we visist, excellent service and awesome food. Ruth Steak House in the Wailea Shops was good, a little formal for Maui, but good food. Tommy Bahamas was a nice setting, good food, and live music at night. Spago at the Four Seasons was one of the best meals I have ever had, worth the money. Ferarros in the Four Seasons provides a nice outdoor setting for dinner, good quality food as well. Summary: We would stay at the Grand Wailea again, great place for families and those who love pools. The beach cannot be beat. Best Feature: The beach and the pools Worst Feature: Lack of good restaraunts Best Food: Spago at the Four Seasons Comparison: If I were traveling without children, I would stay at the Four Seasons without a doubt, much more intimate resort with incredible service. For children, the Grand Wailea wins hands down because of the pools and childrens program. Another tip, get a babysitter through the hotel, there are very affordable and allow the parents to get out and have fun.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe Grand is Grand!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4240071", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from the Grand Wailea.

The best aspects of the hotel were the great staff, stunning grounds, and awesome spa. We found the staff to be the upmost professional and sincerely friendly of any hotel we've stayed at - they really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate and located right on stunning Wailea beach. We spent a morning at the spa, with a three-hour baths/massage/facial combo, and have never felt more relaxed. The next-door Shops at Wailea offer shopping and restaurants, and the hotel is near some of Maui's best beaches and snorkeling. We really felt we'd landed in a tropical paradise at the Grand Wailea. The only complaints we had were the following: The beds and pillows are poor quality, just way to soft for us to get a comfortable night's sleep. The mattress was in fact so soft that I was tempted to sleep on the floor one night. We were suprised to find this at a hotel of this cost. There is not much choice in dining. We found the sushi restaurant, breakfast buffet and pool bar to be good quality (waitstaff at all were awesome!), but in terms of \"fine dining\" the hotel is a distant second to the next door Four Seasons (Spago there is a must if you're in Wailea!) Humu was really a disappointment. We waited 15 minutes for our table, even with a reservation, and ended up leaving without eating due to the slow service. Lastly, and this is not the hotel's fault, there were way too many noisy kids everywhere. Fortunately there is an adults-only pool area that people respected, but we had a hard time escaping very loud, poorly behaved children in other parts of the hotel. Again, the waitstaff at restaurants were very gracious and seated us as far from noisy kids as possible. We found hotels at Kaanapali, and the Four Seasons, to be more adult oriented.

I went downstairs to request an upgrade and they did accommodate us with a room in the concierge tower. The bellhop who took our luggage from the old room to the new explained to us that the room was handicapped accesible and in the area that had not yet been renovated. I got the strong feeling that they try to pass this section of rooms off to people who might otherwise not complain and just accept it - much like a bad table in a restaurant. While the new room was an improvement, it was still not what I expected from this hotel. The room was merely average at this point as far as I was concerned. The next thing that struck me was the clientele. Not a refined bunch to say the least. This was surprisingly a very tatooed, twenty-something, roudy type of crowd. Very small on manners and big on implants. Looked more like spring break in Fort Lauderdale. Staff not too polished either. Last complaint is the food. Mediocre at best.

This was our third trip to the hotel, and we plan to go back every year as long our two daughters insist on it.

The rooms are slightly larger than the standard rooms and afford a mixed garden and ocean view. A good breakfast buffet and drinks plus great pupus in the afternoon are complimentary. When these benies are factored in, we thought we got great value for the $$ expended. Becoming a member requires a $2500 refundable deposit plus a $100+ annual fee, but in return all rooms are 50% off the rack rate. In addition, we received a $300 resort credit which can be used for any voluntary charges at the hotel. Jill Sullivan, the membership director, also sent us a bottle of champagne and food goodies to welcome us as members. We think of the Grand as having three components--a beautiful lobby and grounds, an elegant and spacious adult pool area, and a noisy and crowded family pool/water slide/beach area.

The key here is to set up at the lower pool by the pool grill where the waiters seem to make more frequent rounds. The main problem we encountered at the pool was messy, verging on filthy, conditions by the middle of the afternoon. Many guests of the hotel seem to have the attitude that for the prices they are paying, they shouldn't have to lift a finger.

My son (7) enjoyed the pool for the first 4 days...then it kind of got old. Don't get me wrong...the grounds are very nice...the pool is fantastic for kids....but seriously....if you want a chair with a mix of shade and sun...you had better have it scouted out before 7am or you are in the sun for the day.

And the resort itself (and the grounds) is gorgeous. The room was spacious, but our 'ocean view' was a bit disappointing.

The food was good; service was mixed (our bread & water server was excellent...his name was Eli). That is the only restaurant on-site we considered eating at however...menus at the other restaurants did nothing for us. By the third day or so, the wheels started coming off though. It had lightly rained, and the pool deck was soaked. I nearly fell at least a dozen times b/c the stone they used for the pool decking has to be the most slipperiest thing I've ever seen. People were sliding all over the place. Also, you just start to feel like they are nickel & dime-ing you at every turn. $40 for lunch at the pool for the 2 of us...when I only had a pepsi and my husband had a salad, a water, and a Pepsi. I was charged $10 to make a 4-minute call to Pizza Hut which is right down the street (supposedly 'long distance'???). I did fight them on this, and I think they could tell I was getting pissed, so they took it off the bill. Also, there are SO MANY families there...very few honeymooners. My husband & I love children so much, but it would have been nice to have a little peace and quiet around the adult pool.

From the moment we arrived, the staff was very professional and courteous, always referring to us by Mr. or Mrs. and our last name. The grounds are just beautiful, full of lush landscapes, vibrant art, statues, water, water and more water!!! Everywhere you look, there is water in some form, whether it be a waterfall or one of the beautiful pools. If you have young kids, stay on the ground floor near the pools. Near the pools is where the kids will want to be, and that's the best location if you want quick and easy access to the pools. We stayed near Humu Humu restaurant. The room's patios open up to the beautifully landscaped grounds. You can walk right out the patio sliding door and over to the pool area within minutes. We were in room 0052. I recommend a room numbered in the 0060's. They were even closer to the pool areas. Our boys are ages 4 and 10. There was plenty for both of them to do. They were never bored. They wanted to be at the pools from the time the waterslides opened, which is at 10:00 a.m., and they wanted to leave when the slides closed, which is at 6:00 p.m. I was really impressed at how well the staff monitored \"outsiders\" getting into the pool areas. There are pool attendants posted at most of the pools and waterslides, and they really monitor those who are not wearing the bracelet of the day. Each day all guests using the pool areas must have a colored bracelet on. Anyone found not to have the colored bracelet on is immediately asked their room number, and if they don't come up with the right number they are asked their last name, and if that doesn't match up with their computer's data they are asked to leave the pools. I saw people from other hotels sneaking in to take advantage of the pools and waterslides at our hotel, only to be spotted without a bracelet and asked to provide proof of residency. All the kids really seemed to enjoy the bracelets, most of them displaying a different bracelet for all the days they'd been at the hotel. Some of the kids' arms looked like little rainbows with all the different bracelets lined up. The bracelets also sort of make you feel as though you belong to a private club for the time you're there. You can spot the Grand Wailea folks a mile away with the bracelets lined up their arms. The bracelets are a really cute idea, not to mention it really keeps the crowds down at the resort. We were literally asked by \"outsiders\" if they could have our room number so that they could swim in the pools that day. Of course we said \"sorry, but nope.\" As far as meals, we enjoyed breakfast at the Grand Dining Room. The buffet was excellent, very convenient location, a great place to fuel up for the energy it takes to run after the kids all day at the pool. Lunch at the Volcano Bar was pretty good. Pretty pricey too!!! A small salad was $12.00. The smoothies at the Volcano Bar were all yum. Dinner was our time to go out and explore the island. We ate in Kihei a lot. Kihei is a cute little town with a lot of restaurants all in a row. Maui Tacos was a hit with the kids, very tasty. We tried Mama's Fish House in Paia. Very good, but very expensive. We did not try Humu Humu, after reading a pretty bad review. Had our pixs developed at a place in Kihei called Paradise Photos on Kihei Rd. If you have a digital camera, go there. They know what they're doing, if you're just trying your camera out and need a little tutoring. The pixs were great quality. Try the fried ice cream at Maui Sweet Spot in Kihei. Hawaiian made ice cream was really tasty. Back to the subject at hand. The Grand Wailea was a special treat, a great place to wash away the world's troubles, if only for a week.

The beach is just a few short steps from the pool so we cold have one of our kids doing beach and one doing pool with no problems. The kiosk on the beach will rent you everything from a boogie board or a snorkel to a Hobie Cat. Never cheap of course, but convenient. The restaurants were mixed.

Customer service was stretching to make average. The spa was nice, but customer service in the spa and spa shop were surprisingly poor. Guest should not have to pay an $18.00 resort fee. The list goes on. The size of the room for the price was just okay. The bathroom is very nice, except we noticed that there was mold moderate mold in grouting between tiles in shower. The maid service did not clean the room well each day and we were tipping $7-8 each day. To worsen matters, the hotel put a hold of several thousand $$$ on our credit card even though, we had prepaid for our 8 day stay there. This turned out to be a major problem that took up too much of our vacation time to straighten out. In all fairness the manager, in the end gave us about a $500 credit for the inconvenience after I insisted they credit us for one nights stay. This was a compromise. It took them 3 days to get the matter corrected. Then we had smoke from the adjoining room coming through the cracks of the door between the two rooms. I have a serious lung condition and notified the front desk about the cigarette smoking in a non-smoking area. Their solution was to offer to move us to another room. I responded no, we were not going to waste anymore of our vacation time resolving problems they create.....a better solution would be to notify the other guest and ask them to desist from smoking or to move them.

However, we were bringing our kids and I thought it would be fun for them to spend a few nights and days there so we booked a room and crossed our fingers. It worked perfectly for us. Unfortunately, it did not start out as well as it should have. We reserved a king bed with sofa bed room in the deluxe garden view category. There were no such rooms available when we arrived but they made up for it (somewhat) with free rollaways. They also assured me that I received a deluxe garden view room even though it was not in the area outlined in the description on the website. I frankly wonder if that is the case or whether it was really because the hotel was full. It was a little dissappointing but we did get a beautiful room (it appeared to be recently renovated) and a bit of an ocean view to boot. The hotel itself is spectacular. It sunk in while staying there in ways that it had not when taking a walkthrough. The artwork, gardens etc. are absolutely gorgeous and maintained to an extremely high standard. The pools and beach were a blast for the kids and the adults. However, the pool staff is surly and acts just like the folks you would run into at a regular waterpark, not an extremely expensive hotel. Another negative is that it was the only nice hotel in Hawaii we have stayed at that did not have shower and clean up facilities available for guests who had to check out before they actually left the property. This was not an issue for us because we were leaving for the other side of the island but would have been a problem if we had a late flight. Overall, I was very satisfied with our stay and extremely impressed with the beauty of the property and the fun it provides. If it were just me and my wife, we would still probably stay somewhere smaller. However, I suspect the kids will beg us to stay here again.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orangevale, CA", "Title": "\u201cGrand Wailea was a Fabulous Dream\u201d", "Author": "ruby1027", "ReviewID": "UR3551784", "Content": "We did lots of research before we chose the Grand Wailea, and it paid off. We went for our 18th Anniversary and it was the most memorable time my husband and I have ever shared together. We went from April 28-May 8.

Our maid was fabulous and most of the time we felt like we were by ourself or with very few guest while enjoying the pools, slides, and beach. The room was not perfect, it was a little run down and the bathroom could have used a deep cleaning, but we feel we could not have stayed at a better hotel to relax, have fun and enjoy the best views. We loved the grounds and felt we had the best beach over other local hotels. We recommend Nick's Fish Market and Ruth Chris for fine dining. You can walk along the beach to get to Nicks(the best service we have ever experienced) and Ruth Chris (the best steak)is a quick walk next door. For a good deal drive to Kehei Cafe across the street from Kalama Park and beach on S.Kehei Rd and Lahele. Breakfast and lunch is quick and good(get the fresh squeezed orange juice). Best snorkeling was nearby at reserve and near the most awesome white sand beach. All free! The room service pizza is really good deal and enjoyable if you want to stay in your room. The bed was comfy and the patio is enjoyable to hang out at. We stayed in a garden view room that had a beautiful view. I recommend to go enjoy yourself and relax.

Well-traveled couple in late 20s - early 30s. We both loved the Grand Wailea. It was elegant and luxurious without being stuffy. The grounds were absolutely beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such attention to detail. We probably spent half a roll of film just on pictures of the hotel and grounds. We had the lowest room category, on the 8th floor in the back of the hotel. It had a view of the parking lot and Haleakala. Really, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice the parking lot unless you were looking down. You could also see the ocean from our balcony, with Molokini and that other island in our view. The room itself was great -- there was enough room, it was clean and well-maintained, and the bathroom had a huge walk in shower and soaking tub. We paid $291 a night, which I considered a bargain given the prices of the other Wailea luxury resorts (4 Seasons and Kea Lani). People complain about there being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Grand Wailea (covers use of fitness center, self parking, local phone calls, etc.), but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see what the big deal is. Just figure it into the cost of the room, and when your rate is as low as $291, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a good deal. Of course, the main attraction at the Grand Wailea is the pool complex, and it did not disappoint. DH learned to swim for the honeymoon and he could not get enough of the pools and slides. We both played in the pool like little kids, and we were not alone as far as the adults enjoying the slides (with and without kids). I had heard on various boards that the GW would not be a good place for a honeymoon because of all the families attracted by the pool, and that it was overrun with kids. Not once were we bothered or felt overrun by the families with kids. If anything, it was fun to see them enjoy the slides and all. I think the GW is a great place to honeymoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially for a younger couple that likes to have fun. I have no idea how full the GW was while we were there, but it did not feel crowded at all, even in the pool area. The GW also has a separate adult pool where no children are allowed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very quiet and mellow, and also very beautiful. The lounge chairs around the adult pool are a lot nicer than the ones by the other pool. Our favorite place to hang out while not in the pool was the lawn between the adult pool and the ocean. Very peaceful, and you could find some shade from the coconut trees. We ordered room service several times, had the breakfast buffet (once) and ate at the Humu restaurant. All of the food was excellent, and of course very expensive. But at least the quality was very good. The beach area is also very nice. Absolutely no complaints about the service. Based on my experience there, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Grand Wailea.

I have traveled extensively, but the Grand Wailea still knocks your socks off. It is one of the most beautifully decorated hotels I have seen with its fabulous light fixtures, gorgeous tile work, orchids on the lobby tables, lush landscaping and museum caliber art collection. There is a wedding chapel on the grounds and everyday we saw one or more weddings, some small and seemingly impromptu, some elaborate formal affairs. That was fun and romantic. Our last weekend there was Memorial Day weekend and the resort was full. There were more people by the pool and on the beach than we had seen, but we could still find quiet places to chill out. Every morning we walked for an hour or so on the walkway along the ocean. What a perfectly scenic way to get exercise! There were many walkers, joggers out and everyone gave a friendly hello. We had dinner twice at Humuhumu's and the food was delicious, but the sunset view was spectacular. We also ate at Ferraro's at the Four Seasons, a short walk away. The food was delicious there also. We drove into Kihei and ate at Roy's and I highly recommend that restaurant also. We walked to the mall that is five minutes away and discovered some great restaurants - Longhi's, Tommy Bahamas, and Cheeseburgers-Mai Tai's. Most of those places have great breakfasts that are less expensive than those at the resort. The mall also has general stores, national retailers like the Gap, luxury retailers like Gucci and a camera shop. A great destination for window shopping or picking up those things you forgot. We drove the Road to Hana and saw breathtaking views of the ocean, waterfalls and verdant valleys. I also went up Mount Haleakala to see the sunrise. I was blessed to have a clear day with low clouds, perfect sunrise viewing weather. I took a van there, but folks from Maui advised against one of the excursions offered that involved riding bikes down from the summit. One woman, an emergency room nurse, said they see tons of injuries, like broken ribs, from bikers who lose control. The hotel's Spa Grande, is world class. They offer hydrotherapy with most of the treatments - an hour to soak in various whirlpools, saunas or specialty baths, like mud or aromatherapy. By the time you get to your massage, you are already like jelly! The spa attendants are excellent, both my treatments were outstanding. No negatives about my experience at all.

But alas, there are pools to swim in! The pools were so much fun. We usually sunbathed near the rope swing. It was fun watching the little (and big) kids show off. Every hour or so we'd walk up to the top pool and slide down using the connecting slides until we got back to our spot near the lazy river. It was so fun. Every once and a while we'd stop half way down at the Volcano pool bar under the waterfalls. It's a swim up bar and has tasty drinks and a very friendly bartender. The beach was also inviting. Once a day we'd take a dip in the Pacific to refresh. Beautiful beach. Overall, I would say this is the best resort I have stayed at. It never felt crowded at all yet it was a full house.

One word of caution: if you don't like kids stay away, you don't belong here. On the night I arrived the uptight jerk next door complained because my kids were making noise. Of course they were going to make noise, they just arrived from an 8 hour plane ride to this fantastic place, and were really excited! That put a damper on things from the beginning, so I must stress that this is a hotel for families with kids that have lots of money, plain and simple. The pools here are awesome, they have great slides, a fantastic beach (and man-made kiddie beach for the really small ones), and it is geared for CHILDREN and their wealthy parents, and kids will always make noise! Now that I have finished venting, the service was great in almost every occasion. The restaurant/bar by the adult-only pool had a very rude waitress (black girl) who completely ignored me and was too diva-ish for my taste. At the sushi place, I had to return an order of teriyaki beef three times because they undercooked it each time. Those were the only two problems. Everywhere else, the service was amazing. I loved Richard, the waiter at the one-of-a-kind swim up bar. I loved that bar, god I wish I was there right now. Richard is awesome, he will treat you right. BTW, there is a \"hidden\" jacuzzi above that bar, I didn't find it until my last nght there. The rooms were great, they were huge and I loved them. I didn't care about a little peeling of the wallpaper in the bathroom, to me it made it feel more like a tropical resort, where things aren't 100% \"perfect\". Me and my wife had an awesome time at the spa, I can't wait to get that wacky water therapy thing again, and massages. You get treated like royalty. Humuhumunukunukuapuap'a (or someting like that) provided the most amazing dining experience of my entire life. Oh my god, it wasn't just the exquisite three pound spiny lobster I ate, but the view while eating it. You see, there is one particular table (table 71 I think) which you have to walk down a short wooden planked-walkway to get to, and you have your dinner out in the open, in the middle of the fish pond, with a gorgeous sunset, palm trees, lit tiki torches, drinks served in enormous coconuts, etc. It is paradise, probably one of the most special dining tables in the entire world, if you catch it at sunset.

Yes, I do agree with some of the other reviews as far as the rooms are concerned. They do need some TLC! Our room wasn't as clean as I expected it to be. We also had some wallpaper peeling off and the floors were pretty dirty. Honestly, it wasn't a huge deal, it just needs some extra attention and it would be fine. We were still very impressed with the size of the rooms and the bathroom. The grounds, pools and the beach made this all worth it though!

I loved the little notes and flowers that they left on our pillows every night when they would turn down our bed. It was a cute little touch. I've also noticed that alot of the other reviews were complaining about noise from children and construction. Well, in my opinion this again is not as bad as they are making it sound. Our room was actually on the end of the hotel that is by the construction and we heard nothing. The only time we could hear it was when we were walking down to the beach, and it wasn't loud. I was never bothered by the sound of children laughing and having a good time either!! We ended up renting some snorkel sets for the day and had a great time out in the water.

We researched for months agonizing over whether to choose the GW, the Four Seasons, the Fairmont Kea Lani or the Hyatt in Ka'anapali. We wanted everything to be perfect for our honeymoon. After consulting guidebooks, tripadvisor, looking at pictures, talking to friends, etc. - we decided on the Grand Wailea. When we got there we were floored. The place is magnificant. You feel like you are in a palace. We are both around 30, but have done a fair amount of travelling for both pleasure and business, and nothing compares to the Grand Wailea. Our room (which was upgraded from the cheapest - Terrace - to a deluxe ocean view) was large, clean, well appointed, had a balcony plus a large grassy area where we could relax with coffee or wine and gaze out over the ocean. The bathroom was huge with a two person tub (c'mon it is our honeymoon), a separate shower with a bench (which I guess is nice for shaving your legs) and very soft towels. The room was always cleaned promptly and well. Despite how nice the room was, it couldn't compare with the grounds. The gardens/pools/beach were incredible and far surpassed their counterparts at the 4 seasons, Kea lani, or the Hyatt (we had to make sure we did in fact choose the best place). I will admit that there are a lot of families, but the place is so huge, plus there is an adult only pool, so we weren't bothered by it once. A close second to the grounds was the spa. Spa prices may seem expensive (well, everything in South Maui will seem expensive), but each treatment includes an hour in the bath area. Even if you aren't a spa person, you should splurge - it's well worth it. We only ate at the hotel once - having the breakfast buffet at the GW dining room. If there is a breakfast buffet that can justify a $25 pricetag, this is it. I would recommend the GW to almost any traveler. Families, Couples, whomever, there is plenty for everyone. If you are demanding in the area of service, you might want to opt for the 4 Seasons which staffs at much higher levels. We never had a problem, but we are pretty low maintenance.

If you are considering a vacation at the Grand Wailea, you should be aware that the resort allows loud night-time private parties with cheesy cover bands (A la \"The Wedding Singer\") on the lawn areas near the guest rooms. If you like to go to bed before 10 p.m. (which can feel quite late if you are adjusting to a time change), or don't like to involuntarily listen to cheesy cover bands during your Hawaiian vacation, this is not the place for you. The music is also too loud to hear the TV in your room, so you can't drown it out that way. Plus, since the parties are private, you can't even practice the \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" philosophy by joining the festivities, so you're pretty much stuck enduring the noise until 10.

We complained to two managers (one during the party and the other as we checked out). We were told that others had also complained, that the band's volume was too loud, and that it was the \"Catering Department's\" fault. There was no expression of genuine concern about the issue. From what I can tell, this is normal, business-as-usual, for the Grand and not an isolated event, so buyer beware. (They were setting up for a new party as we were checking out yesterday.) As others have also noted, keep a close eye on your hotel bill. They charged us for a fridge that we did order (or receive). (No apology for the error.) There were other issues during our stay, but I'll stop here. If the Grand Wailea appeals to you because it's fancy and has water slides, I'd recommend the Hyatt on Kauai as a more pleasant alternative. The Hyatt has similar pool facilities and is a much more \"Hawaiian\" experience. (The Grand feels more like Las Vegas.)

The bellman who approached me with my key became irritated that I did want my bags moved until I checked out the second room to make sure it was O.K., realizing there was not going to be a second tip to move bags (until I checked the room), he threw the room key at me and stormed off! Unpleasant and unprofessional for supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My wife and went up to the second room on the fifth floor and there were beer cans mini-bottles on the floor, the beds had been slept on, strangely the bathroom had been made up. I stopped a service person in the hall to ask about the condition of the room and she mentioned that some of the staff like to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the rooms after guests check out, open the mini-bar and help themselves, which is then billed to the guests account (nice story, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from one of the hotel employees!) Back down to the Front Desk for a room that has been cleaned. Another hour wait and I got to watch the bell staff rough-housing and generally acting like a bunch of unruly teenagers, where is the management at this place? Back up to the seventh floor and finally a room that has been serviced, the carpet was stained, the shower had big masses of hair on the wall, and the toilet was dirty, and the wall next to the toilet had brown spots that I did not want to investigate. I have stayed in nicer Holiday Inns, but it was getting late and I did want spend anymore of my vacation at the front desk, so my wife suggested we go down stairs to eat. While walking down to investigate the restaurant with my wife, and we had to jump off the path into the bushes to avoid being run-over by three hotel employees \u00e2\u20ac\u0153joyriding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a large service cart on the walkway. At this point I had had enough, and went next door to the Four Seasons for dinner, the Four Seasons is the hotel the Grad Wailea is supposed to be, I would have moved there but they were booked up. When I got home and the bill arrived there were charges for valet parking everyday even though I did NOT use valet parking due to another couple warning us they had their camera stolen from their car while it was being valet parked. I asked the front desk for my charges at check-out, and there were no parking charges, they waited and billed me later for the charges, what a scam! Unprofessional and rude staff, poorly kept rooms, unsafe grounds, disgusting food service, and the list goes on and on. There are only two types of people who stay at the Grand Wailea, those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know they got ripped off and say it is O.K., and those like me who know they were completely ripped off by the scam artists who run this hotel.

In a word, outstanding. We booked two of the least expensive rooms. When we checked in, they had automatically upgraded one of the rooms to an ocean view. That was great but it put our children in another wing. By the next morning at 9AM, they had our children upgraded as well right next door. The staff was superb about it. We are even in the wing closest to the construction going on next door at the Wailea Beach Villas. It never bothered us at all. Ask for a refrigerator so that you can stock up on waters and snacks. (we bought ours plus wine at the General Store at the Shops of Wailea next door; very upscale - has a Ruth Chris Steakhouse and a Tommy Bahama restaurant). We asked for one for each room and they gave us the kid's one gratis. We have had two amazing breakfasts at Longhi's at the Shops of Wailea. Had breakfast at the hotel buffet which is very good but Longhi's is better. Get your chairs early at the pool as it will fill up by mid morning. Love that they have an adult only pool which is a great temperature. Lemon ice water available at the pool all day long. Only annoyance are folks on their cell phones at the pool thinking that other folks care to hear them. There was a corporate recognition event going on so lots of folks hobnobing at the pool. Husband and kids liked the slide. Walk the beach walk and it's a great 3 mile workout. Had two great dinners at Humu and Konshi in the hotel. The best was Nick's Fishmarket at the Fairmont Kea Lani two doors down. You can snorkel right off this beach. Went into Lahaina to see the show Ulalena. It's OK if you have small kids. Our 18 year old was bored. Ate at David Paul's in Lahaina which has the most amazing bread. Rest of the meal was very good. Went into Kehei to see a movie and ate a very low-key (bordering on dive), authentic Mexican dinner at Fernando's that one of the waitresses told us about. The Spa here is the best I've been to in a while. The prices of the manicures and pedicures are ridiculous but the treatments are reasonable when you consider that the hydrotherapy is free with any treatment. (if you need a manicure or pedicure, go into Kihei to the Nail Shop). That is an amazing set of different baths and showers that sooth and massage. And an attendant will loofah you down for free with a body scrub. Very well done.

Depending on what you are looking for, I would say The Four Seasons is the better property of the two. The room was larger, nicer, less expensive and so many of the amenitites considered \"extra\" at the Grand Wailea are complimentary at The Four Seasons. That said, my children had the most wonderful time at The Grand Wailea and we would definitely stay there again on any return trips. We never even used the Children's Camp as the pools are like being at a Water Park and they wanted to stay there all day. The hotel is huge and the grounds beautiful. Our room was very nice and close to the pool (a must if you have kids). We were there over spring break and the hotel was 100% booked, but the slides never had very long lines and the pools never felt over full. It was hard to find chairs the one day we went out to the pool in the late morning, but we just walked to the beach and set up out there. The food at the pool is very good and convenient. We rented a refrigerator ($25.00 for the week) and kept milk and cereal in there for breakfast. I would definitely say this is the place to stay with kids, and we had a wonderful time. The hotel let us check out late, stay at the pool after we did check out, and made a hospitality room available to us so we could shower and dress before heading to the airport. None of us wanted to leave and when asked what were their favorite parts of the trip, all of my kids had The Grand Wailea as one of the top 3 (right behind snorkeling and a helicopter ride over the Haleakela crater!!) One caveat, I did hate being charged for every little thing (when you are paying $650.00 a night, it just seems like some things should be included). This was especially irksome because we had just come from the Four Seasons where are children were greeted with gifts in the room as well as a snack and where beach cabanas, umbrellas, roll away beds and even the children's program are all COMPLIMENTARY - AND where we had a larger, nicer room with an ocean view for $200.00 a night less. The Grand Wailea needs to up their image just a tad and stop charging their guests a resort fee as well as make roll away beds complimentary.

I should point out that we both have very high expectations of such accommodations (very \"high maintenance\" travelers!). Grand Wailea is without question a beautiful facility. The grounds are lovely and our room met our expectations. The view from our balcony was spectacular, and we were able to watch both whales and sunsets without obstruction (bring a pair of binoculars if you're going during whale season). The adult pool was very nice, as was the lawn spreading down from the pool to the beach. We spent most of our lounging time on the lawn (only downside was when you found yourself focusing on the near-constant \"beep-beep-beep\" of construction vehicles at the new condo site next door). In fact, while we're on the subject, be very careful if they try to put you in the Chapel or Walea Wings, since they're closest to the construction, which will undoubtedly be continuing for many, many months. The kid's pool was also nice (we enjoyed the slide as much as the kids, I think), and the kids are definitely separated from the adult pool area, so that's not a problem. Hotel staff was pleasant enough, although there didn't seem to be enough servers at the adult pool/lawn area. Biggest problem for us was the incredibly high prices of just about everything ... they really do hit you with alot of extras. Personally, I can't understand why a hotel that charges you $399 per night also has to charge you a $20 \"resort fee\" every day ... I mean, why else would you BE there except to use the resort facilities? Even prices at the lower-end dining facilities were high ... one dinner consisted of a club sandwich and a personal pizza, no salads, no liquor and no dessert, and it cost us $62! We went to the grocery store and stocked up on bottled water, juice, sodas, chips/salsa, etc. A bit of a pain to keep re-stocking the little space allowed in the mini-bar, but an extra refrigerator for your room is available (at a price, of course). We saved by parking ourselves in the garage, which was actually closer to our room than walking to the lobby for the valet service. My wife used the fitness club and found it satisfactory, although sometimes crowded. Our stay was lengthy enough that I wanted to get my goatee trimmed ... was told by the salon that they would be happy to do it ... for $30! I ended up stopping by a barber shop in Kihea and had the trimming done for $5! In general, we love Kihea and Wailea, and we would love to return. Not sure we'd spend the extra dough for the Grand Wailea ... our next trip, we'll probably explore the condo options.

The cabanas are $130 per day- if the pool service was better, it might have been worth it, but we very rarely had a server stop by to ask us if we needed anything. They were understaffed and overwhelmed and it was disappointing. Humuhumu was a great meal, but rushed. We shared a '97 Jordan Cabernet that wasn't even half gone by the time we were ready to finish our meal and therefore wasn't worth it. Kincha is very authentic; excellent sushi. I wouldn't go back for the full meal, though. The overall service just didn't compare to the Four Seasons. Our oceanview room, though nice, wasn't worth $800/night. It was really small and cramped. We paid a bit more at FS and Kea Lani for suites and in the future, won't do it any other way. The room service was poor. It never felt clean. Four Seasons blows them away in this area. We did take advantage of the onsite photography services and were very pleased with the quality and professionalism. The art that is displayed throughout the resort is fantastic. Check out the original Picasso lithographs- they're very lucky to have such a wonderful collection. Wailea is the only way to go, in my opinion. Shopping and golf is the best on the island. The restaurants are top-notch. Expensive, yes...but what do you expect? Sea Watch at the Wailea Gold golf course has an unparalleled view at sunset and the food was incredible. Sarento's on the Beach, which is run by the same company that owns Nick's Fishmarket, is also a great seaside dining experience with excellent seafood dishes. Both of these restaurants take you off the properties and still have great service and cuisine. Longhi's at the Shops at Wailea was also good food, however the view left a bit to be desired. The Four Seasons restaurants that we recommend are Ferraro's and Spago. Before leaving, I booked dinner reservations at a few restaurants for 7:00pm. After arriving, I changed most of the reservations to 6:00 so that we could watch the sunset.

I saw the Grand Wailea featured on the Travel Channel and thought it looked like a fun place to stay. It was absolutely luxurious without being gaudy. The tasteful artwork and manicured gardens overflowing with vegetation and water elements (koi ponds, salt water ponds, waterfalls, fountains) created a lush environment, all while maintaining an air of sophisticated elegance. It was quite a romantic setting. However, the other resort guests took away all that romance - 90 percent of them were families with young (loud) children. The big draw for families is the miles of pools and waterslides. I admit, the on-property water park is what sold me on the place when I decided to book it. The pools are fun for about a day and then the abundance of children and high doses of chlorine grated on my patience and sense of tranquility. I made the mistake of practicing my snorkeling in the pool - I encountered a discarded hot dog! It was a good thing they had a wonderful spa, which offered free use of the hydrotherapy baths and showers with every treatment. I must say, those baths are like none other! 7 different warm pools with fragrant, brightly colored water. The showers were also a treatment within themselves with their massaging jets. Bottom line, the Grand Wailea is a great family resort. It tries really hard to be a honeymoon destination for adults with its wedding chapel, spa (great place to get away from the kids), night club, fine dining; but can't help being a water park with expensive rooms. I give it an above average rating because it is truly gorgeous with terrific service, but must warn all hopefull couples.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeauty, Class, Value\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3194245", "Content": "Thanks to the suggestions I had read here, I asked if I could receive an upgrade as we were celebrating my wifes birthday.

The room had nice oceanview, but the condition of the room was poor. Paint was falling off from the bedroom ceiling, the bulb of the lamp was burned out without being replaced, and the tile was dirty, needed some serious scrubbing, just wasn't worth the amount of money we were paying.

Our first visit to Bistro Molokini, took 15 minute for a server to even approach us (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), the server seem to have no knowledge about the menu at all??Our entrees took about 45 min, and the pizza my kid ordered was terribly overcooked. Next day, took a diving trip in Lahina, came back found the room was in the same condition when we left. Gone for six hours and not a single housekeeper came up? Thinking of eating off property, but kids were hungry, so we went to the floating retsaurant which was recommended by the front desk staff. The restaurant was uniquely designed, somewhat elegant. Upon arriving, we noticed the restaurant was 90% full. Informed the hostess we don't have reservation, she asked us to wait for an opening. An asian manager greeted us and was very accomodating in finding us a table. Not a very nice table by the water, but the lobster tank kept the kids busy. The manager was very polite and calm, asked us if we would like to start off with drinks while waiting for our server. Knowlegable about the menu and wines, he made few suggestions. The server seem to be a little overwhelmed, he took our orders and rushed back. The food was above average, my wife loved the snapper and prawn, my $120 lobster dish had nice presentation but a bit chewy. My two kids had great time when the manager took the time and showed them the lobster and kept them busy feeding the fishes. Thank you very much for your hospitality!!

The dining at the Grand Wailea was a bit overpriced, but the convenience of not having to drive somewhere made up for it. Humu Humu was probably more remembered by me for the atmosphere rather than the food, but I am glad I went. Molokini Bistro was an excellent restaurant and we had a great view of the ocean as the sun was setting. The volacano cafe/grill was also a great place to get some nachos during the day.

We travel frequently and try to find the highest quality hotel or resort when we go. Travel is special to us, so when we go, we spend freely because we want what we think is the best we can find. So, were we childless, we'd go next door to the Four Seasons. Were we on a honeymoon, we would flee the Grand Wailea, flapping and hollering because the megalopools/slides/connecting canals/rope swings/hot tubs can be with shrieking, squealing kids, all having the time of their life. So, having said that, we all absolutely love the Grand Wailea and will go nowehere else on Maui until our son grows up. Even then, we may return to relive the wonderful memories we've had there (and, despite the caveat, the grounds and feel are tremendously romantic). OK...and the big slide is really, really cool. It is a huge resort on lavishly lanscaped, sloping property. Art, tikis, pools, streams, koi, hidden nooks to sit and zone. No cost was spared in the construction and maintenance of the grounds. Thus, for adults, get ready for a drilling on the cost, but if you're looking for a deal, go elsewhere. Maui's expensive. Reality. This was our second stay here. The rooms are large, airy, and comfortable, a substantial lanai is in most (or all?) rooms, as I recall from previous stays. We were upgraded to a suite that I don't even want to think about the cost. We're picky about beds and pillows and found nothing to criticize in anything on this count; same with towels and other personal amenities. The service was always, always prompt and friendly. Breakfast is $65 for 3 at the buffet (which we all like, despite our extreme aversion to buffets), lunches are kind of tough because the poolside cafe is relatively limited-salads, cheeseburgers, pizza. The restaurant choices for dinners are...OK. The main restaurant, Humu Humu, is situated on a very large salt water pool filled with native fish and is an excellent choice for a sunset drink, sashimi, tossing bread bits into the pool to trigger a feeding frenzy (probably shouldn't do that, but can't help it), on your way to somewhere else for the evening meal. The beach is perfect, if you don't want to body surf. Very good snorkeling is available on the reefs on either side of the beach. Rentals wound up being most cost effective if done for the week. I think it is $45, otherwise it was $5 per hour. We found moray eels, green turtles--huge thrill--the usual other reef fish suspects. Chased puffer fish and goat fish until exhausted (we, not the fish). The pool system contains so many interesting things it's silly. They're all landscaped as lavishly as the rest of the grounds. The top water slide causes screams in adults. The smallest ones interconnect one pool to another and are a pleasure to drift through. If you don't have kids and are still reading, this is the time to stop, because their kids camp deserves mention. It is teriffic. Our son hates kids camps. Always. However, the kids camp here was what he lived for everyday--actually night. They have a ridiculous number of the most current computer games and, if you don't want your kids to play computer games, their activities are creative, fun, and keep the kids busy and interactive until the movie time in the late pm. Our son did the camp more nights than we'd care to admit, at his insistence. Beach crab hunts, gecko hunts, crafts, kickball, scavenger hunts, all supervised by a teriffic staff. In summary, we happily give the Grand Wailea five stars for excellence. This is a resort that is structured toward pleasing all tastes, and doing so on a grand scale. Despite some of the volume-oriented necessities, such as colored wristbands to utilize the pools and such, it still pulls it off. While pleasing all people at all times is impossible, given how well it does so many different things, we really have no criticisms to level on the property, service, staff, fun, etc. It IS a place where there are a lot of kids, so factor this into your plans.

On our nightly walks, it seemed as if we were the only ones there....it was truly wonderful!! The food is just fine as far as flavor and VERY pricey........(Think $30 for breakfast for one......, $6 for a bottled water, $15 for a hamburger, etc etc...) we found ourselves leaving each night and going out to dinner at the local places... If you like Sushi, be sure to visit \"Sansei\"....best sushi I have ever had! The drinks at the Wailea are pricey as well ($9 for frozen, $6 for a beer). All that to say remember your at a 5 star \"resort\" and not a convienence store, so be prepared to pay what they want to charge you for these items. On our 6th night there, three rowdy teenage girls moved in next door and were making tons of noise....think ........\"Like I'm sooooo trashed\"..(giggle, giggle, scream scream).....\"Look a MINI BAR\" Whoooo Hoooo....let's get wasted man\"..... we were not going to spend the rest of our vacation listening to underage girls trying to handle their alchohol intake, while there parents were not around.........so, I went downstairs and asked to be moved...The Wailea outdid themselves on this one!!!

The \"crowds\" at the pool did not bother us; in fact, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves on the water slides, rope swing, water elevator, and lazy river each day we were there! (I should say that we are a fairly young married couple, with an eight-year-old and a two-year-old, so we're used to kids being around. We did not have the children with us on this vacation.) If you choose, peace and quiet are only a minute's stroll away at the Hibiscus Pool, an adult-only area that was quite tranquil while we were there. The resort's architecture, artwork, landscaping, and facilities in general are nothing short of stunning. The Spa is phenomenal - book your first appointment for early in your stay, because you'll want to come back! The fitness facility was outstanding, far exceeding that of other hotels and resorts, and included a juice bar, along with complimentary iced towels and mint face mist. Plenty of cardio equipment & plenty of free weights; you won't have to skimp on your workout. We had the opportunity to eat at two of the resort's nice restaurants during our stay; Humahuma and Kincha were both excellent. The poolside cafe is very good as well, and they will take your order and deliver to you in your lounge chair (although it is definitely faster to pick up your order yourself). It's kind of fun to have a drink and lunch at the swim-up bar as well; the warm water that's pumped from under the bar will keep you warm while you eat. If you're into manicures & pedicures, you can have your cake and eat it, too - in a cabana poolside. There is excellent shopping on the premises as well, and the Shops of Wailea just outside the resort entrance are wonderful, upscale boutiques if you choose to wander further. All in all, expect luxurious surroundings, great food, exquisite artwork, beautiful views, attentive staff, and endless pampering... just don't expect to have it all to yourself. There WILL be others at the pool, there WILL be some noise, but there are definitely worse things than being able to afford to stay at a resort as wonderful as this one.

My kids loved the slides, but again, they are intense...I am actually surprised that they allow very small children on them at all. The pool area is intensely crowded and there is outright competition for seats. The prices of the poolside services were downright laughable...we expected the hotel to be pricey but 150.00 poolside hair braiding for CHILDREN and 85.00 pedicures gave us a giggle! The views from the rooms were lovely and the food was very good in the restaurants, although we enjoyed going over the The Shops at Wailea for dinner because there was more variety.

The property is large and beautiful, the rooms were very nice. We were originally in a deluxe oceanview room, which was beautiful, with a HUGE bathroom. Unfortunately, the room was all the way at the end (the right, if you're facing the ocean), and was right next to a huge construction site; starting at 7am, the trucks roll in, and no more sleeping is possible. We complained, and the manager moved us to a HUGE suite with master bedroom, living room, wrap around balcony, and 1.5 baths. This was a great room. The grounds are very nice. Wailea beach is nice, though not as perfect as we had imagined. The river pools/slides/water elevator were much fun, though there were lots of kids. However, the resort also has a separate adults only pool with its own sitting area; we sat there, and it was nice and quiet. Here's my biggest complaint. There is virtually no shade anywhere near the pools. NONE. So if you have a fair complexion, you're in trouble. The only option that you have, which seems like a bit of a scam, is to hope that you can rent a cabana for like $140 a day. After the immense price of a room, charging for shade seemed unreasonable.

Also, they let older children (who are well behaved) in some of the classes, and our kids had a blast in the hip-hop class and the rebound aerobics class. There are still two areas where the hotel is lacking. First, the restaurants are nothing special. Instead, try Spagos at the Four Seasons, and Longhis and Tommy Bahamas at the Shops next door. Second, renting a cabana is a mysterious nightmare. They don't seem to have their process down. You can wait on a wait list for days, and then hear nothing, or you can go down to the pool at 7am and reserve one. We traded off doing this with friends that were there (sharing a cabana with them).

That however, is where the problems with this resort start. The service is not up to the fees that they charge. The mark of quality just doesn't get met. For example, orders were lost or delayed 3 out of 4 times while dining at the resort's restaurants. Not once was there a reason given by a server or manager. On our first morning at the resort we ordered breakfeast from room service. Only one meal was brought to the room despite two being ordered.

He even comped a gift certificate to one of the resort's reasturants. Nice touch- but having a clean room from the start would have been more appreciated. The pool areas are very busy.

Based on some of the reviews I read I went with cautious optimism. The good: Upon check-in we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom in the Napua Tower (up from the Terrace Garden room - wow). I was excited, we ended up paying $325 per night for a room with a published rate of $825 per night. Much to my dissapointment, I have to say, it was just a room (perhaps a little more spacious), but nothing outstanding and as I read in earlier posts - actually a little worn and a little dirty. If I had paid $850 per night for the room, I would have been very upset. But on the plus side, when staying in the Napua Tower there is complimentary continental breakfast and evening cocktails and snacks. The breakfast was good and even included some type of egg dish in the morning and in the evening the open bar was great and the snacks good - that probably saved us at least $50-80 per day. One of the primary reasons we booked this hotel was for the pool - we brought our 5 year old. He loved it! I have to say it was one of the best pools I've ever been in - taking as much as 10-15 minutes to swim from top to bottom. I was worred before we went that due to his height he wouldn't be able to use all slides, but it turns out it doesn't matter. They let all kids go on all the slides that connect the different levels and just monitor the two ancillary slides that don't impact getting from one level to another. It was nice to be able to get out of the pool and be right at the grill. We didn't have any problems finding shade or getting a chair - but I suspect the hotel was only half full. The other thing I thought would be great was Camp Grande. I checked it out the night before I had a reservation and was told by some 8 year olds, that everybody was out night swimming. There was no supervision there for the 8 year olds. The next night (my reservation night) was scavenger hunt night. There were a total of 13 kids that night (mostly 8+) and 2 counselors. My son told me the next morning they went for their savenger hunt out by the ativity pool. That made me feel a little uncomfortable - two people managing a group of 13 in the dark around water. No harm no foul, just be informed. Food was average, so we ate elsewhere. We did the Four Seasons overlooking their pool - which was much smaller but had a much more elegant feel to it. Definately not a kids pool. If you like Tepanyaki try the Diamond Resort - they'll send a car for you and the food was outstanding. I've never had a 4 course tepanyaki dinner before (seafood appetizer, salad, soup, sorbet and then lobster tail, vegetables, fish, beef, etc. ) Way more food than you can eat -You won't go wrong. We did learn one lesson - don't use the conceirege to book anything. You pay full price and then find it half price or less at the activity stands dotting the island. I usually expect when traveling to get taken for a couple hundred dollars, but not at my own hotel. The staff were nice, but their didn't seem to be enough of them.

Absolutely unbelievable experience!!! I had the Zen Body Treatment, and it was great. You arrive an hour before your treatment, and experience the various pools/tubs, Japanese soaking tub, massaging shower, steam room, jacuzzi, dry sauna, and have a gentle exfoliation by one of the young ladies downstairs. The downstairs gals help you with experiencing the waters and showering, etc.Some ladies wear bathing suits, but most are naked. (The spa has a ladies' side and a men's side.) You have your towel wrapped around you, but are naked in the tubs. You don't get a robe until you are headed toward your treatment upstairs. Be prepared to be naked and/or see lots of naked bodies.After being called upstairs for your treatment, you are greated by your treatment person and escorted to your room. My treatment began with a pineapple/papaya scrub and exfoliation over my entire body. Rinsed. Then a seaweed wrap. (It got a little warm and itchy, but felt good.) While wrapped, she did a lavender oil face and scalp massage. Rinsed again. Then an all-over lotion application. 80 minutes total.Afterwards we lounged on the lanai for a bit to recover, and then spent a bit more time in the water areas. The treatment was $240, and you are supposed to tip both gals. So......... that was a $300 half a day, but worth it!

Here are the positives: -great location -beautiful, well kept, grounds -some well designed pools -decent sized rooms. -the housekeeping staff was wonderful, they truly went out of their way and were very informative. The negatives: - Staff - Overall, I found that the staff at this facility went about their jobs in a perfunctory manner, rarely going out of their way for anyone...if they in fact met the minimum of what would be expected. For instance, I dined at both the Bistro and at Humahuma and felt very rushed by the wait staff...with no effort made toward giving any sort of personal service. I definately did not feel that they earned their tip in either instance. I found the same lack of attention on the part of the bell desk and valet/door staff. The resort really needs to do something to address their labor issues. - Rooms - For a facility of this caliber, the rooms and thier bathrooms exhibit too much wear. For instance there were MANY chipped tiles in the bathroom and the grout looked liked it needed to be cleaned. - Hours - the bar and restaurants close too early. If you want to eat after 9pm or go to the bar after 11pm, then you need to head next door to the Four Seasons...they had a nice jazz combo playing. - Construction noise - If you want to relax by the pool, during the day, then I hope you can do it in the midst of construction noise. The Grand is building condos next to the Chapel wing and, of course you can hear the sound throughout the day. Overall, this is a resort that is trading on its past glory. I believe it is overpriced for what you are getting. If you are traveling to Maui and want the type of experience that you believe that you should get from this type of resort, I would suggest that you check out the Four Seasons or the Fairmont.

We went to get married on the beach and spend our honeymoon. We started our vacation at the Maui Prince. That resort was wonderful, we were treated like VIP's and loved everything about it. We scheduled the next four nights at the Grand Wailea. The minute we pulled up to the resort, we both became tense and upset. We arrived before check-in and my husband ran in to see if we would be able to check in early. He didn't pull up in the very front in case we couldn't check in yet and we weren't prepared to have our car valet parked if we couldn't check in. After about 20 minutes, I became restless and began to make my way in when I was accosted by a valet who told me I couldn't leave my car there. I told him we were checking in and apparently that didn't phase him because he told me if I left the car for 20 minutes, they would take the car and park it and charge $15. Growing agitated, I told him I would be right back. At that point, he insisted that I give him the keys. When I found my husband, he was visibly annoyed. Although we were lucky enough to have been able to check in (many in front of him were turned away even with reservations as they were \"just too booked\". My husband informed the desk clerk that it was our honeymoon and we'd like an upgrade if possible. Apparently, the Grand Wailea must get a lot of honeymooners as the clerk was completely unphased and didn't even respond. (The Maui Prince and the Ritz made it a point to congratulate us and even sent bottles of champagne). Another thing they apparently missed was giving us flower lei's when we arrived - must have been too busy. Thought that was a customary thing in Hawaii - especially at the nicer hotels. The room was nice and the grounds were definitely beautiful. However, we couldn't enjoy it as we soon noticed that the hotel workers union was striking (some type of contract problems with the new owners of Grand Wailea) and marched out front every day until 7 with bullhorns and signs. People were driving up and down the street honking and even with the TV blasting in our room, we couldn't drown it out. When my husband called the manager the first night, he informed him that at least we weren't on the other side of the hotel because they were right next to the construction (building some new timeshares on the property). He did offer us a $200 gift certificate to one of their restaurants and promised that the picketing was only one night. Of course, the next day, it started again. My husband called and spoke with another manager who told us that there was no way the first manager would have said the picketing would last one day becuase it had been going on for a while and they weren't prepared to make any adjustments whatsoever. We managed to get two extra nights at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua where we spent the remaining six nights of our honeymoon. And the Ritz was $200/night cheaper with an oceanview! The Grand Wailea does not seem to care much about their guests. It is DEFINITELY not a place you want to go on your honeymoon - there are too many kids.

My wife and I love to travel and we use trip advisor a lot to preview places and the reviews I read on the GW were very random. Here is a very honest opionion of the hotel.It is situated north of the 4 Seasons and the Kea Lani. I walked to both via the ocean walk/running path to check them out. The 4 Seasons is beautiful but it had a smaller pool than the GW (remember 2 kids). But worst of all was the humorous display at the pool with a group of fat, elderly, east coasters dripping in gold and swimming in white body hair telling the Evian mister girl \"that it is too much\" with that soothing accent.I realized that if it were just the two of us with no kids I would still have preferred the GW. Spago at the Seasons is fantastic.The spa \"Spa Grande\" was nothing short of phenominal. I don't need to say anything more there.There is an adult pool and the waterslides are for the kids. If you don't like children, stay where the adults are. If that isn't enough, go to the 4S's. If you are cost concious and will have a heart attack over $8 drinks then go to the Holiday Inn. Am I one of the few that can logically put these things together?After talking with a bunch of locals we found that the most crowded times to go (the times with the most complaints) happen to be those coinciding with school vacations. Makes sense right? Our stay was outstanding. We loved Kincha, Humu Humu and all the resturants. Saw whales from the room balcony and watched our kids have the time of their lives.

Booked a terrace room (least $$$) in the Molokini wing. Our view was of the mountain and the 4 Seasons next door. After extensively touring the resort and taking advantage of its many facilities, I think the location of our room was ideal! Close to the pool & beach and also convenient get a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast at the cafe. We didn't experience any long hikes anywhere we wanted to go. We met a family staying in the Napua (concierge) while tir room was lovely, we had to take two elevators to get there from the pool. Ugh. The pool and beach area is excellent. It's windy and split up into several areas. I think this design accommodates the crowds well because we never felt like we were swarmed by people. We got the same spot at the pool every day. If you like convenient access between beach and pool, the GW is ideal. Both the Fairmont Kea lani & the 4 Seasons wailea are beautiful but you either sit at the pool OR the beach, not both. The pool area at GW flows seamlessly into the beach, including the public beach walk. It has very good feng shui in that regard. Meals at the resort were disappointing overall. Food at the pool is way overpriced and bland. After 5 days I was tired of the same salads and sandwiches. We enjoyed two lovely dinners at Bistro Molokini where the food was good but not memorable. Our best meal was the buffet breakfast at the 4 seasons-it was an easy early morning walk and a great food. Camp Grande was great. We never dropped our children off there but you can freely use the facility at your leaisure. There are video games and computer games and two nice toy rooms for kids. It was a great place to hang out before dinner. We also took the kids to a hula class and a lei making class at the camp. They charge a ridiculous $20 for each session, but the kids had a blast. Counselors were lovely and seemed to truly enjoy their jobs. About the spa. WOW! I booked a lava stone massage. After the first hour in the hydrotherapy baths, I could have gone home happy. The massage was icing on the cake. My experience at the spa was fabulous. I thought the staff was friendlyand gracious but not overly so. I had no complaints other than the fact that I spent over $200 in less than two hours. We were all sad to leave the Grand Wailea. The thing was, while we were there, we hadn't seen Hawaii! We couldn't bring ourselves to leave the resort too long. It's really a destination resort because there is enough to do (or not do) that you are completely satisfied.

The reason to stay here is the water park, pools and spa. Nothing in Hawaii can match their water activities or spa. On my first stay I was in awe of the property and very impressed. The original developer from Japan spared no expense. However, a decade later the resort has changed hands and not as Grand as it once was. The rooms while a little above average, the bedding, carpeting and furniture are showing wear and the marble bathrooms while large have seen better days. To be fair the new owner KSL is replacing beds and furniture but will make you no guarantees that you will get a renovated room. If you want a nice room look into the Four Seasons or the Fairmont Kea Lani next door. Nevertheless, the room specials can make the price very attractive for the expensive Wailea resort area. A tip is to look into the Resort Membership Program. You can get 50% of the daily rack rate for giving them a $2500 loan for 3 years You pay a annual membership fee of $120 and get your investment back. You must join 30 days before your stay to take advantage of the savings and they will often run a special for $500 off the $2500. This can easily pay for itself if you stay more than a week and especially if you need more than one room. WARNING- we had heard their was \"renovation\" going on near the Chapel Wing. Reservationd lead us to believe it was minor. Let's be absolutely clear. Their is major construction going on next door for a new luxury condo. During our stay in early Feb their were noisy earth moving tractors and trucks operating from 8AM and 5PM affecting the Wailea and Chapel Wings that could be heard form the adult pool and inside closed rooms. In addition, be aware the Grand Wailea shares the same Beach as the Four Seasons. The recent storms in mid January took away a less than half of the beach and brought in many rocks.

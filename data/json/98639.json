We were told that the hotel was just renovated a few weeks ago. The lobby is sparkling and the bar/restaurant (The Front Yard) was VERY nice and a grat place to hang out in the hotel (The Build Your Own Burgers were fabulous!). Staff and room quality was the same as a typical Sheraton hotel. The rooms were very spacious and very clean. Only minor issue was the configuration on the bathroom door (which almost smacked into the toilet when you opened it all the way). The location was good as it is just a few blocks away from a huge shopping mall (Galleria) and tons of restaurants. The only complaint is the freeway construction right in front of the hotel (the hotel is on a frontage road so a bit tricky to navigate). They also have a complimentary breakfast for guests which was quite good!

First, I'll just say that nearly all of the previous complaints about the place, specifically that it \"felt old,\" are obsolete. I've stayed at plenty of five-star and boutique hotels, and the new Sheraton lobby (including its multiple dining and bar areas) is, quite simply, a stunner. VERY stylish decor, though not in an overtly trendy manor (well, except for the filament lights above the bar, a design element well past the point of cliche at this stage), and they even have nifty Android tablets on which you can (at check-in) flip through everything the hotel offers and (at the bar) flip through the entire food and cocktail menu. Speaking of the latter, it has a host of concoctions clearly designed by a talented mixologist that would put many of the country's so-called \"speakeasies\" to shame -- and at reasonable prices to boot, with most in the $7-$8 range. Even more surprisingly, this is one of the very few hotel bars I've encountered that had actually attracted a sizable crowd on a weeknight -- no easy feat, as most hoteliers can tell you. As for the rooms ... well, unfortunately they're nowhere near the design level of the lobby, even though they've been redone floor to ceiling. The first problem is an inherent and almost entirely unavoidable one when you're renovating a '70s-era property: the ceilings are low (7.5 feet, with the bathroom closer to 7) and the bathroom is pretty much miniscule, undoubtedly because it would've been cost-prohibitive to expand it or even change the basic location of its plumbing elements (tub, toilet and sink). The bigger problem, however, is that Sheraton somehow cheaped out on its room decor, with the notable exception of the bed, which is as good as any Starwood one I've slept in short of Westin's famous Heavenly Bed. There's a dinky 32\" flatscreen TV -- a stark contrast to the 42\" models you'll find at Aloft Hotels, which are supposed to be below Sheraton on the Starwood totem-pole chain -- and the decor is only interesting if you're into *a lot* of beige and browns. Worse still, the rooms lose major brownie points for failure to make them comfortable and convenient for business travelers. Not only does this property have the \"free lobby wi-fi, but $11/day for the privilege of using it in your room\" mentality that always befuddles me when I encounter it, but during the course of the remake the hotel failed to install the most basic thing a traveler needs: electrical outlets. The *only* one I could find that wasn't behind a bed, desk or dresser was in an electrical strip awkwardly taped to the bottom of the desk, and I had to climb under it to get to it. (Note that only one outlet on the strip was free, never mind that the average business traveler usually needs two minimum, and preferably three or four.) Alright, getting back to the good points: service all-around was remarkable considering the hotel's newness, with very prompt check-in (including meeting my request for a high-floor king room away from the elevators and not facing the adjacent freeway, even though I was traveling on a Priceline rate) and restaurant/bar service. The hotel serves a free hot breakfast, which I appreciated to the umpteenth degree, and offers an array of touch-screen computers in the lobby; I'm not sure if you can access the full Internet on them, but you can certainly print out boarding passes and the like. Although I admittedly hate paying for parking, which is mandatory here even for self-parking (to be fair, it's a fairly small lot, and there aren't any street-parking spots in the immediate vicinity), the cost ($10/night, with unlimited in and out) seemed like a bargain compared to its nearby sister Starwood hotels, the Westin Galleria and Le Meridien, which have the audacity to charge $18/day when you can just as easily park in the mall garage for free. I'd definitely recommend the hotel, particularly at the obscenely low rate I paid on Priceline, but two caveats: first, the I-635 freeway adjacent to the hotel is in the midst of a substantial expansion, and the area will likely be congested and filled with construction vehicles for the next several years. Also, as already noted, the hotel is indeed confusing to get to. I happened to know how to get there only because I lived in Dallas for 13 years, but basically you have to take 635 (a.k.a. the LBJ Freeway) to get there. Heading east down the freeway, as you would if you were traveling from either of the areas two airports (DFW and Love Field), you'd get off at Dallas Parkway (essentially the access road for the Dallas North Tollway) and make a u-turn onto the 635 access road. Heading west it's probably easiest to take the Alpha Rd. exit and continue along the access road until you get to the hotel. I'm sure a GPS system or a smartphone equipped with voice navigation would help as well.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cOk location, management misses the mark\u201d", "Author": "David P", "ReviewID": "UR123621083", "Content": "Hard to find with all the access roads in and around dallas freeways, the main problem was at check-in and out, had zero knowledge that I was a platinum spg member, in addition was put in a regular hotel room which im not mad about directly next to two elevators like i redeved it through a travel discout site which i didn't.

I stayed in a corner room at the southeast corner of the 9th floor. The room itself was really quite nice, with high-quality furniture, very comfortable bed, good pillows, good quality sheets. I was especially impressed with the very effective blackout curtains the really blocked every bit of light from the adjacent freeway and airport. With the curtains closed and the lights off, the brightest source of light is from the gap between the room door and the floor. The soundproofing measures taken with the windows seem to be effective. I was able to hear a police car driving on the freeway with sirens on, but otherwise outdoor sounds were absent. Indoor sounds are another matter. This room had an adjoining door to the adjancent room. This inner door wasn't particularly well insulated for sound. I could plainly hear my neighbor's television until 12:30AM. I solved the problem by leaving the AC fan on all night. Business travelers should note that this hotel charges you $10 a day for internet access in your room. I suppose most business travelers will pass this cost on to their company and wouldn't think much of it.

That being said, this was an average stay at a hotel. Like the reviewer before, I stayed at the hotel when during the Dallas Cup for soccer. It was FULL of teenagers that ran up and down the halls at all hours of the night. They even knocked on our door at midnight. I don't feel that this was the hotels fault, though. The room itself was spacious. We were given a king size bed. It has Tazo tea and Starbucks coffee. The bathroom was extremely small and the tub had more than a few scratches on it. I suspect that they put us in a slightly less than perfect room because we had a pet with us. The hotel respected our \"Do Not Disturb\" wishes. When we asked for housekeeping, creamer, and a set of towels (over the course of the 4 days were were there), we were greeted by name and they responded quickly to our requests. The fitness center is really great! It is the first treadmill and elliptical I have seen that has a built-in iPod plug and it also has TV capabilities, but I never used the TV. There is a water cooler with cups in the gym. It has three treadmills, two ellipticals, a set of free weights, and an all-in-one resistance station. Fresh towels are also provided. Only two elevators were working and they were really slow.

I searched the hotels.com for a hotel of at least 3-stars which could guarantee me a non-smoking room and was able to reserve this Wyndham by the Galleria.

It smelled like lung cancer. You would shake the bed cover and pillow and small ashes could be seen flying off into the air. I went back downstairs and asked at the front desk that they switch me to a non-smoking room and they said that they had none. I said \"how is that possible as I reserved and PREPAID for a non-smoking room?\" and they smirked (seriously) and said \"read the fine print - we give you the best room that is available considering your request - and there are no non-smoking rooms available\". I went back to the room quite upset and thought well then maybe I can just open the window for fresh air. THE WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN! How crazy is that - hundreds of smokers in this room and no ventilation - not even a fan to the outside? I tried to turn on the AC/Heater for fresh air and all it did was stir up the ashes in the room.

My partner and I were recently married, and upon hearing this, the staff organized a complimentary bottle of champagne for us in our room. A very nice touch. The service was top notch, from the front desk clerks, to the restaurant/bar staff and in particular, the incredibly nice/helpful valet staff - who were always asking if we needed any assistance and gave us suggestions on where to go. I would suggest that if you don't mind paying a bit extra, to book their signature cabana rooms. My partner is bit of a light sleeper, so we decided to go with the cabana (garden), otherwise I would have personally opted for a balcony/poolside cabana, as it is in the centre of all the party/action (esp. during the weekends). Nevertheless, our room was nicely furnished - modern and pretty chic - and also a balcony that overlooked the garden/courtyard. The only downside was the bathroom, which was on the small side. In terms of food and drinks, the burgers and fries were great at 25 Degrees, and the Library Bar - which is situated in the classic lobby - served decent drinks. Unfortunately, we did not really spend too much time at the Tropicana bar, as we were out exploring most of the time. On the one night that we decided to stay in and visit the bar, they had a private function - so unfortunately it was closed off. Apart from that, the hotel is a great place for those wanting to experience the old Hollywood-style glamour, and great for tourists, as it is just opposite the Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre and tour buses.

The Hotel is ornate and a bit weathered, but adds to the nostalgia. I read reviews where the bathrooms were tiny, and they were, but for us it added to the charm of the hotel. I would make sure that your room isn't over the bar/nightclub downstairs, as we were on the 2nd floor (3rd floor, but directly above street level) and the music played loud until 2am on a Wednesday night. Outside of that, the staff was very helpful and willing to go out of their way to assist. We did not eat at the Hotel or go to the bar, so I can't speak to that. We arrived on a Tuesday night, checked in, rested for a couple hours and then headed out to see what was around. I knew some reviews said Grumann's Chinese Theater was near, but didn't realize it was practically right across the street, along with the Kodak Theater (where the Oscar's are) and the Kodak Mall, which has nice shops and restaurants, and a place way in the back where you can take your won picture with the Hollywood sign in the background without any obstruction. We were able to watch the Red Carpet for two movie premiere's, which was a great experience for our 16 year old daughter, and us as well. It was great to be right in the action of the red carpet. This is also very close to some great restaurants within walking distance and we felt safe in the neighborhood walking around at night, as long as there were crowds around, which is pretty late. It's also about a 10 minute drive to Universal Studios Hollywood, so made for a great location to get around to other attractions.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRooms\u201d", "Author": "Krystle M", "ReviewID": "UR126838460", "Content": "We only came to stay for one day on a Sunday so this review pertains to the room and room service.

As older people, we noticed that the hotel seems to cater for the younger brigade. Regardless, we had a quiet and enjoyable time and were not bothered by anyone. Room looked over the pool which is a great spot to relax on a sunny day. Whilst at the pool, it is hard to imaging the mayhem that lies outside. Hollywood Blvd is no longer a place to fear but a place anyone can enjoy. The only problem we encountered were the \"Premier\" nights at the Chinese Theatre, which made it difficult to get back to the hotel if we had been out and about. No fault of the hotel though. Hundreds lined the Blvd to get a glimpse of whoever it might be going to the particular premier. Fun for them but a pain for us. Summing up, the hotel is in a perfect location for anyone interested in the history of making movies or being right amongst the most famous places in Hollywood. It is also in a great spot for getting \"Downtown\" via rail $1.50 or Santa Monica / Beverly Hills by bus. Don't bother asking the hotel for a map of the area as they only have a tear off map of LA which requires a microscope to view.

I thought it would be a great experience...it turned out to be an average hotel stay. To someone considering a stay here for the first time, I would say yes so that one can experience the hotel. The pool area and historic reception area are certainly areas to see (although one can visit those two places without staying at the hotel). If I were staying the area again, I probably would consider elsewhere since there are a lot of unique hotels in the Hollywood / Beverly Hills area. Service - We checked in at about 10:30 PM on a Friday evening. Surprisingly, there were several other people checking in at this time so the reception area was busy. The person that checked us in wasn't the most personable - a quality I expected at this place. He seemed a bit rushed and preoccupied. Everyone else we encountered that was employed by the property was much more friendly. Valet parking people were always prompt and efficient in the tight vehicle quarters that the hotel has. Location - As the hotel is located right on Hollywood Boulevard and just steps from the central attractions on Hollywood Boulevard, I could think that there are only a one or two other hotels with equal or better locations. Amenities - We did not have time to use the hotel amenities as we were busy checking out Hollywood and Beverly Hills during our two night stay. From a walk-through, the property was nicely maintained. The pool area was clean and organized. The eating and drinking places on the property all seemed to be top quality and attract several people not staying at the hotel on the weekend evenings. Room - Probably the most unimpressive part about the stay was the room. We stayed in a Queen Superior room and it was probably one of the smallest rooms I've stayed in the U.S. I realize that this is an old property, so that would kind of be expected. By the time two people fit two suitcases and other belongings in the room, it proved to be very tight. We were also given a room that was on the back of the hotel, third floor - which conveniently overlooked a roof, so we couldn't see anything. I'm sure there are a lot of good rooms - more decent size and better views.

The Kodak Theatre is just a few steps away. Sometimes \"boutique\" hotels trade on the name but let you down in the actuality. I didn't get the feeling that this place was slacking in any way. Rooms were clean, crisp and bathrooms very, very chic (although dark). I kept feeling that although modern, Cary or Marilyn might walk in at any moment demanding the starring role in the next screenplay on the coffee table. Phwar! The staff was very friendly. Not a hint of the snobbies, noooo that is reserved for some of the guests, those with rolling accounts, and those 'wanna-be's\" and \"may-be's\" and other assorted posers who were breaking their necks to see and be seen. You have to be in the mood for it... cause if you aren't strutting it or working hard to not strut it... you'll definitely overdose on the self propelled hype of the patrons. Take it in stride. It is funny watching everyone work hard at being Hollywood. Get there early, stake out a place at the bar and I guarantee you, the antics are more entertaining than reality tv. In fact, I've said it here first. If I find my idea makes it to the little screen. I want a cut. :) Now, back to the rooms. Dark, minimalist, with white sheets/duvet. Furnishings are modern/retro/minimalist. Flat screen television that I never touched, cause I was at the LIbrary downstairs. Heh-heh. Great mini-bar selections. Although it pisses me off to stay in an expensive place and find they want to gouge me for the water. Come on!. Absolutely fantastic place to go when you want to see and be seen, find some footprints at Grauman's, and soak up some L.A. vibe.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cRoosevelt EXCELLENT!!!\u201d", "Author": "Meg704", "ReviewID": "UR125002318", "Content": "Staff were brilliant!

A firm bed and decent bathroom. On the tv was a live feed outside at the Chinese theatre. $5 Fiji bottles of water are strategically placed around the room. I read a bit on the history of the hotel (celebrities that visited like Marilyn Monroe, etc. Stories of certain floors being haunted) and it is easy to start to like this place. I needed to print some documents for a meeting. The lobby has two free internet ($15 in the room) kiosks with a printer attached. I printed a 50 page document and no one blinked an eye...they actually offered me a stapler. At night I fell asleep and didnt hear a peep the entire night. Not even a door slamming shut.

Worst hotel I stayed at all year.\u201d", "Author": "AVeryPickyTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR123079951", "Content": "I had such high hopes for this hotel. I was on a week and a half long swing through California and decided to stay here while in Hollywood. I love historic hotels, so this was going to be one of the hotels I was most looking forward to. This hotel claims to be a luxurious class of hotel ... I found it to be everything but. For tourists who (for some reason) want to stay close to the drag queen hookers, pan handlers, drug addicts and cheesy t-shirt shops that is Hollywood Boulevard, it is a great location. But aside from being right across the street from the Walk of Fame and the famous Chinese Theater (which is a curse and a blessing), this hotel was one of the WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCES I HAD ALL YEAR! First of all, there is almost NO service attitude here. The hotel hires the typical 'Hollywood type' ... young, attractive with an attitude. Almost every staff member I encountered at this hotel had a terrible attitude. They really seem put out having to work there and treat the guests rudely. When I went to the concierge desk (a late 20s - early 30s guy) he didn't even look up at me while I was asking him a question. He was writing some notes and kept his head down the whole time and answered in short, clipped sentences. And gave me some pretty bad recommendations to boot. I reserved a suite and asked if they had any upgrades for frequent Thompson guests while checking in. I was told that the room was upgraded already, which I thought was good. Until I got to the room and found out it was exactly the type of room I booked. When I called down and asked about this they explained that the 'upgrade' was that I was put on a high floor. Hmmm ... I didn't realize that a hotel upgrade literally meant 'up on a higher floor'. Even the bartenders had a 'dude, im going to be a famous actor one day, don't bother me' vibe. The single biggest rip off in this hotel is the Beacher's Madhouse scam. The only time the staff here go out of their way is to hawk this terrible club. Apparently, someone figured out along the line that Teddy's (the now closed for rennovation uber-guest list club in the Roosevelt) was a great way to get young 20 something year old drunken LA kids to wait in line to pay $15 for a beer. So, they opened Beecher's Madhouse and paid Kelly Osbourne (previously David Duquette until he bailed) to put her name on it. Beachers claims to be sold out for years in advance. However ... surprise ... surprise ... they slide fliers under every hotel guest's door that offer the the opportunity to get into Beachers for $150 cover ... or $500 - $5000 for table service (alchohol not included). I peeked into the club (know some people in LA who got me in free) and it seemed like it was 'over the top' crazy ... as if someone on acid designed a club and put things in for shock value. Maybe cool for the first 5 minutes but after that, you would need to take acid to forget how much you paid to get in. Total scam. One thing I was VERY dissapointed with is that the hotel is PACKED full of non-hotel guest 20 something year old Jersey Shore kids. They are all drinking at the clubs and bars ... decked out in their True Religion jeans and high hooker heels ... hanging out in the lobbies taking up all the furniture in the public spaces and swearing like truckers/sailors. Def. not a place I would EVER bring a family. The public spaces are nice (if you can get past the jersey shore trash all over the place) and are made up to look like 1920s Hollywood with big tufted leather couches and dark wooden beams and ornate painted ceilings. There are bars everywhere ... it didn't take me long to figure out this hotel caters to the young, jet set party crowd. The pool is awesome, but is almost always closed for photo shoots. At night the best time to go is around dusk when they turn the space heaters and firepits on and it is not crowded with the Situation and JWoww look-a-likes making out on couches. However, $15 for a mixed drink served out of a plastic cup or $8 for a beer is a bit much to charge. And the fact that most nights the pool bar closes at 10 p.m. in order to give business to Beacher's Madhouse is lame. As for the room ... again, think young, hip 20 something crowd. The walls and ceilings of the hallways are painted dark grey so it looks like you are walking down the hallway of a haunted house. There are paparazzi photos on the wall in black and white. We had a suite, which was very spacious but it almost felt like someone moved a ton of furniture out. There was a small coffee table, cheap looking microsuede couch, and a mini-bar with no coffee maker. The bedroom had a bed and a tv stand and a night stand. There was TONS of empty space in the room where most hotels would have put an arm chair in the bedroom. It was obvious they saved money on furniture by making the rooms empty and cavernous. We saw the maid cleaning a standard room and were literally amazed at the size of the rooms ... they looked like a closet. Smaller than a dorm room at a city college ... seriously, you really need to re-think booking a regular room unless you don't mind a closet with a bed. The bathroom was incredibly small. Literally the toilet/sink were in a space the size of an airplane bathroom. There was a shower/tub with cheesy tile walls and half a glass partition which made the floor all wet anytime you took a shower. The view from the hotel was good, overlooking the Hollywood sign and Walk of fame. There was no car service and cabs are pricey in LA. Parking was expensive as well ... I might be inclined to skip the valet and park my car elsewhere to save time and $15 - $20 per day. There are nice, safe places for $10 per day in the area. Overall, this was a very dissapointing experience. The room was cheap looking ... drab, depressing and dark. The service was beyond reprehensible ... rude and non-existant. At $200 - $350 per night, they have a lot of nerve to provide such bad service. The only good part of the hotel is the lobby area and pool area, which is unavailable at night because of all the drunk club kids taking up space before leaving the hotel after the clubs close. There should be a guests only area/lobby. This was a total dissapointment. If I had it to do over I would have booked at the Rennasaince across the street, which is cleaner, nicer and doesn't have a Jersey Shore infestation. Or the Hollywood Hills Hotel. Avoid the Roosevelt. I am very dissapointed in Thompson as a frequent guest to the brand and very dissapointed at the management of this hotel.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHipster dofyi\u201d", "Author": "tomdenverDenverCO", "ReviewID": "UR123047954", "Content": "Great historic hotel that has had its soul ripped out.

Unfortunately that's where the positives stop. The air conditioning units are so loud we had to shut them off when we slept. One night I called room service to replenish the coffee (there is no free coffee or tea by the way), and bring up some wine glasses. They never came. We ended up falling asleep waiting for them. The next morning we had breakfast in the burger restaurant, and they completely stuffed up our order a couple of times, left things off, and served a cold breakfast....no applogies. They obviously knew that our tip would reflect the service so automatically added 18%, which they did not do the previous morning. Just to compound things, only 1 of the 2 lifts was in working order, so it took at least 10 minutes to get to and from our room each time, longer if you had bags are we were unable to squeeze in. Overall quite disappointed, and next time I will stay in Beverly Hills or Santa Monica beach.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLocation only\u201d", "Author": "MMMc55", "ReviewID": "UR122803844", "Content": "The location and history of this hotel is brilliant.

We booked a room, through an agency, which was supposed to ajoin the garden or pool area. The room was not cheap, I had previously stayed there in a similar room a few years ago. After checking in we were shown to a room on the 1st floor overlooking a car park at the rear of the property. After reading more recent reviews of the hotel I was alert to the many complaints and chose to complain up front and be quite ascertive that this was NOT the room I had booked and paid for. The desk clerk was not so much apologetic but quickly assigned another room, which was all he could offer, another first floor one, this time with a balcony overlooking the garden and similar in design as the one I had booked over the net. Be alert to what you have booked and be ready to grumble. Not really what you'd like to expect for the prices they charge here. This hotel features more and more on video clips, MTV, ET, E!

It is right across the road from the Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. The downside of this is that there is always a crowd right outside for most of the day and night. There are spruikers on microphones and electronic flashing bill boards, lots of traffic and many sirens. It's a hectic and loud area. The hotel itself had positives and negatives for me. On the positive side the pool area is very nice, in fact all of the public areas of the hotel look great and have a very stylish vibe. The decor throughout the hotel, especially the corridors, is dark with dark brown walls and dark wood. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 5th floor and we had problems with the elevators. There were only two lifts servicing our floor, and for our 2 night stay one lift was almost always not working. Also, the 'down' button for the lift on our floor was not working, so we had to board a lift that was going up in order to eventually be able to access the ground floor. It seemed that many other guests had the same gripe as it was a major topic of conversation during the elevator ride. Our room was an adequate size, but the bathroom was very small - to give you an idea the toilet roll holder was on the opposite wall to the toilet but was easily reachable. We had a combined shower/bath with a glass panel. This looked great, but didn't work. Water leaked everywhere and whenever anyone had a shower we ended up with a great puddle of water on the bathroom floor. The shower tap was a 'mixer', but you could only adjust the temperature - the hotter the water the stronger the pressure, you could not reduce the pressure without lowering the temperature. There was also very little space to put any toiletries, and with a family of four, we only had room only for our toothbrushes. Also, there was no window or exhaust fan in the bathroom. Our beds were described as 'two Queen beds' but these were smaller than the Australian-standard Queen size we are used to. They were more like an Australian Double - having said that, the beds were very comfortable.

Whether it's a good or bad experience depends on your willingness to accept this hotel for what it is: a glamorous, overcrowded place for people to party. Kind of like the Meatpacking District in New York, before it became really upsetting. The Thompson Hotels slogan is something like, \"we treat ordinary people like rock stars and rock stars like ordinary people,\" and that's the feeling you get here, as parties in the many, many bars and private rooms hidden away in the hotel become louder and crazier as the night wears on. At 5 in the morning, through an adjoining but locked door in my room, I could hear my next door neighbor vomiting loudly, and somehow it didn't annoy me; it seemed like a rock star thing to do. But, as someone who isn't a celebrity, I have no idea if famous people are treated as though they're ordinary. Clearly, this place isn't cheap. If you are paying for something at the Roosevelt, service is excellent and fast. If you want something with no price tag attached, like clean drinking glasses, they will pretend to listen, and never bring the item. The only tip I have to save money is to not use the valet service, with is something like $60 a day, and instead use the parking garage across the street, located under the mall complex next to Grauman's Chinese Theater. It's only $20 a day, with no need to tip anyone. I know that room quality varies at this property, but I loved my room, which had a view of the red carpet outside of Grauman's, where I could see flashbulbs popping nightly.

We stayed at a much cheaper hotel just up the road for a few nights then we stayed here, unfortunately. When we arrived, our pleasant enough 20yo front deskess noticed it was our honeymoon. She said \"Oh that's wonderful! Hold on, I'll get you some breakfast vouchers for you to use!\" We thought that was really nice of them. Eventually, after about 7ish minutes she came back to tell us \"I'm sorry, we actually don't have any....\" Okaaaay then... Although it wasn't that big of a deal, they need to learn that it really is the little things that matter. It felt that what she really said was \"You're really important to us and we want you to come back here......Oh wait, no you're not we don't really care if you do or not..\" It would have been great if she had said \"I'm sorry, we actually don't have any.... but we'll cover your breakfast at our hotel tomorrow morning.\" or \"sorry but here's a discount voucher to one of the million things to do in Hollywood\" To me, it didn't seem it would have been that hard but aparrently it would have been. That's OK we thought. They would have placed a little congratulatory bottle of cheap wine in our room like every other hotel had during our month long honeymoon. Nope, nothing there! Eventually a bottle did come though. The night before we left! A little bit late we felt... Our room was nice enough. It was away from the party rooms around the pool thankfully but we were woken by drunken, disrespectful people traipsing through the hallways in the wee hours on one occassion. Don't touch anything from the mini bar. It all costs twice as much as it does across the road from any number of liquor outlets for the exact same bottle. Also, I had noticed on another very recent review that money was taken from a room. No money was taken from our room (we kept it on us) but I'm very certain I left my 320gig ipod classic next to the bed after we'd left and upon enquiring about it, they said there was nothing found in our room. I can't say I definitely left it there but it was where I used it last. So be careful about your belongings!! After the stay, my wife said the best thing about the hotel was the hot valet parking attendant guy. Is that what Thompson Hotels think make a great stay? Good looking, young people that slightly know they are? They would do well to take a big bite of humple pie and visit that great little hotel up the road called \"Magic Castle\" and learn a thing or two about customer relations... Perhaps us out of town honeymooners just didn't get the \"Hollywood Roosevelt\" and we're being a little over critical but we just felt that we weren't that important to them and that left just a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouths.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quakers Hill, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTerrible hotel, do not leave any Valubles in your room\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer0_0_0_0", "ReviewID": "UR120139288", "Content": "I would deter anyone from staying at this hotel since we had money stolen out of our room and security did confirm only hotel staff had entered our room but they would not offer any reimbursements.

Bathroom tiny and the shower glass was obviously not sealed properly as leaked. The clincher for us was that we were waiting on a hamper from home to arrive for my friend's 30th birthday. Her birthday came and went and when we followed up whether anything had been delivered, we were told 'no'. We followed this up with the people who'd sent the package and they advised that it was delivered the day before my friend's birthday. When my friend went to the front desk to investigate the girl looked surprised and said 'oh it arrived just today, sorry.\" Err, no! My friend proved it was delivered two days prior but not before the front desk had made her feel like it wasn't their problem and it was just too bad. We did end up getting a $50 room credit for the inconvenience. I wonder if we hadn't of known about the hamper being delivered whether we would have got it at all?

I thought the hotel was perfectly nice and functional, but there were a few things that just weren't that great. Location: Near the intersection of Hollywood and Highland, right in the midst of the walk of stars. The streets are filled with tourists, and the vibe is loud and central, not secluded. Thankfully the valet service is on the back side of the building so you can come and go in relative peace. I don't love this part of LA, but I was there for a conference so we made the best of it by trying a nice hotel near the conference center. Hotel: Check-in is at the back of the hotel, on the lower level, by the valet parking. The valet/check-in staff were all very helpful and accommodating. I checked in just after 1 PM without a problem. The old lobby (on the upper floor) has been renovated into a seating/bar/party area. The hotel is beautiful, with a great classic Los Angeles feel. One night the old lobby hosted a party, and I could literally hear the music (faintly) on the 5th floor. I'm sure the lower floors were disturbed. They also don't allow you to walk through the old lobby when events are going on, which can be annoying if you wish to exit to Hollywood. Valet: They were always attentive and helpful, but the hotel hosts events so valet can get quite busy. If you need to leave, call well in advance for your car. One time I called 15 minutes early and still had to wait 5 or so minutes. You can always tell them \"I'll need my car in 30 minutes\" so they can judge for themselves where in line to put you. Room: We stayed on the 5th floor of the tower in one of the two queen beds rooms. The room itself was pretty nice, though some things were ill-thought out. Why have a closet painted entirely black when there's no light inside? It was hard to find items a couple of times. Also, the bathroom floor was tile painted gray to look like concrete, but the paint was badly peeling. No functional problem, but a little but much for a $250/night room. The bathroom was also quite small. The beds were excellent, and the linens were excellent as well. Bell service was helpful. The room only had two towels, which was typically not enough. Pool: Beautiful pool, with a very deep end (10 feet or so), and I think it's some sort of saline/chemical mix (definitely not just chlorine). Lots of lounger chairs, which were quite full in the sunny afternoons. I took a break from the conference and relaxed poolside with a book every afternoon. Gym/Restaurants: The gym looked nice and the restaurants are supposedly quite good, but I went to my home gym's Hollywood location instead and dined elsewhere. Clientele: Definitely the hot young Los Angeles crowd, with a few older European tourists thrown in for good measure. The folks sitting around the pool were usually on the younger side and quite beautiful. The girls appeared to be in a contest to see who could wear the skimpiest bathing suit. The guys were pretty hot, and several were obviously gay (showing PDA). The poolside bar was good but pricey (gin and tonic = $14), and the poolside waiter service was good.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly\u201d", "Author": "Pukekho", "ReviewID": "UR117934141", "Content": "Great location as close to Beverly Hills and 3rd Ave. The Spare Room Bar is amazing.

The first room I checked into was a shoe box, so I upgraded for $50 and got a room 3 times the size. Both rooms were very tired and furniture very worn BUT the bed was very comfortable. There was a plumbing malfunction one day, with no hot water so I washed in the bathroom basin with cold water. No apologies or allowances were made with the bill. Also check your bill thoroughly. I was initially charges $150 a night instead of the $50 advised. BEWARE, this is not a place to come and relax or hide away from the seething masses outside the door photographing the stars on the sidewalk. This is the local pick up joint. There are girls wandering around the hotel, inside and out in high heels and bikinis. They even check into the hotel in high heels and bikinis. The pool parties start at 11am and keep going with very loud music. So if you are looking to feel like you are in a gangsta video the pool area will be just the ticket.

Here is a list of what you can expect from this hotel: 1. Dirty rooms with hair pieces from previous guests. 2. If you ask for extra towels, shampoo, conditioner, or ask to have your room cleaned., etc. expect that you will not receive the service for a minimum of 4 hours even after calling the front desk continuously. They do not care about their guests, I know this from personal experience and other guests who have stayed here before. 3. There are other guests who smoke weed in their rooms at this hotel, if you call the front desk to report about this, trust me they don't do anything about it. Don't think that just because you have a non-smoking room that you won't have to deal with the smoke from the room next to you. 4. Two managers to watch out for, Julius and Don [--]. If you have to deal with these two people, expect nothing out of it, and I mean not even an apology for any issues caused by the hotel. The only manager who is kind and very polite is named Kareem who comped our room for the inconvenience. 5. Beware, if you complain about your stay at this hotel, they will refuse service to you for future stays. As it is their right to do so. HOWEVER, If you complain numerous times about a situation they ignored to rectify, they will threaten to have you arrested for trespassing the next time you come to their hotel. If you ask them why, they will tell you they don't have to explain why. 6. I have personally called corporate Thompson Hotels to explain to them the situation that occurred. All they did was relay the message to the GM at Roosevelt whom did nothing but reiterate the same message I heard when I first complained about my stay. \"Do not come to this hotel, go somewhere else\" - Don [--]. Trust me, that is verbatim, not to mention he also raised his voice on me after I told him I would make sure not recommend this hotel to anyone and that I would write a review about my stay and experience with them. After saying this, Don [--] threatened to have my comments on review websites to be removed and to have a reply review about me personally!!! Can you believe how the hotel's general manager talks to a customer. Like I said, I have NEVER been to a hotel that treat their customers in such a manner. I personally don't write reviews about any hotels, good or bad. BUT this hotel and my experience with them needed to be posted. As you can see, I am beyond frustrated with the ways this hotel has treated me. I would hate for anyone else to go through the same issues that I have gone through. Save your money, this hotel is way over priced too. If you are in this area and want to experience your stay at a real luxury hotel, try the \"W Hollywood\" , \"Renaissance Hollywood Hotel & Spa\" or \"The Rebury\". I have personally stayed at all three and I can't explain how amazing their services and level of class has been.

In fact, I love the Tropicana poolside bar, which is why my boyfriend and I decided to book a Cabana Suite hotel room to celebrate his birthday - steep at $800, yes, but a poolside room next to a great bar at which our friends would have no problem getting past the door seemed like a no brainer. And, it was an excuse for a little inland staycation. We checked in around 3pm and the front desk people were very friendly. That was the beginning and the end of the good service for the next 24 hours. Beween the front desk to our room, we were met with security who interrogated us about whether we were staying in the hotel while pool-goers nearly ran us over to get to the pool party. Apparently, our suitcases did not make it obvious enough that we planned to stay the night. Then, he asked to go through our open shopping bag in which we held our two bottles of champagne to celebrate the birthday. We were promptly told that there is no outside alcohol allowed in the hotel. WHAT?! I'm not allowed to bring a bottle of champagne into a room for which I'm paying this much? We had to \"check\" our booze at the receptionist. Throughout the day, we had a variety of extremely unpleasant experiences - from the rude room service (who forgot part of our meal and charged a double service fee to bring it a second time) to the absolutely derogatory guest services who balked at my request to bring a cot for an inebriated friend to even the valet guy who told us our car took so long to bring around because \"we didn't call correctly.\" I have never before spent $800 on one night at a hotel. But, I have also never been treated so rudely by hotel staff. From top to bottom, we were made to feel as though we should feel privileged to be staying at the Roosevelt. Maybe it's outdated of me, but what happened to the tenets of customer service - e.g. the customer is always right?? When I made even the most mundane requests, there was not a single person I dealt with at the hotel who told me what they COULD do for me.

One good thing about this place is its location\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right in the middle of all of the touristy action of Hollywood. The Roosevelt was originally decorated in a Spanish Style but unfortunately it was remodeled in 2005 and looks as though they stripped most of the old grandeur one would expect to see. You can see in the hallways they carpeted over saltillo tiles. Our first suite was decorated in a modern style\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit reminded me of a 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bachelor pad.

The young folks in the room next to us were up ALL night talking, leaving the room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dslamming the door, returning and continued talking. I understand the Hotel has no control of what their guests do in their rooms, but perhaps when they were remodeling, they could have installed thicker drywall. The next morning we told the front desk about our noisy neighbors, they gave us a blank look and begrudgingly gave us a new room.

First of all, you can't beat the location. It is on Hollywood Blvd across from Madam Tussaud's/Grauman's Chinese Theater/Kodak Theater. The subway is a 2 minute walk (and then it was one stop to Universal), the Hollywood and Highland shopping area is two short blocks away and there is a public bus stop right in front of the hotel (for Santa Monica and Venice beaches, the Beverly Center/Grove shopping malls etc). There were two designer shoe warehouses (one on Hollywood, one down Orange Drive on Sunset) and I spent hours there. There is also a CVS right across the road. The elegant glazed tiles on the lobby floor and stairs spoke of another era and there are lovely indoor fountains. The rooms could use a bit of renovation (but the furniture and furnishings were definitely not tired) and the bathroom was very small, but everything was clean and comfortable and we loved the minimalist black/white/chrome look. The pool and Tropicana bar were amazing, if a bit crowded. This is a very 'happening' hotel and the common areas were noisy over the weekend. But we heard not a peep from our room. The front desk staff was very efficient and accommodating (especially Jeanie/Jenny?) and the concierge was very knowledgeable but housekeeping kept forgetting to leave toiletries/bathmat. However, calls to the front desk remedied the matter instantly. We also didn't get a turn-down service or chocolates, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth complaining about.

A great addition to the hotel is the Spare Room, a hidden bar on the mezzanine that refers to itself as a 'game parlour'. Things head south when we discuss the pool situation. Pool area is beautiful: cozy chairs, adjacent bar and loungy soundtrack. Configuration allows for nowhere nearly enough chairs to accommodate guest demand and this renders the pool off-putting, a velvet-rope type affair where friends of the staff get preferential treatment or one needs to purchase bottle service to guarantee a chair. This made for a tiered atmosphere that made us feel not necessarily welcome. The area is also extremely understaffed. We nicely put in a simple order for food and beverage and it took well over an hour and a half for it to arrive. It should also be noted that parking is 33$ a day (+ tips) and expect a sizable wait amidst those frequenting the hotel's many bars.

The Hollywood Roosevelt is a star itself from the 1920s, having hosted the first Academy Awards in 1929. The Roosevelt's restored period elegance is obvious in a walk through the lobby, complete with gurgling fountain and interior balconies that overlook a polished tile floor.

Step outdoors to the pool and the style is glitzy 1950s Vegas cool. No Frank, Dino or Sammy, but martinis punctuated with olives seem as popular as margaritas. Today's cool is evident in the lines of twenty-something fashionistas that form early on weekends to enter the ground floor nightclub. Hungry?

We had a connecting room so he pointed out that might be the reason we could hear so well in the other room. He apologized several times and helped us move our things to yet another cabana room.

This was the last hotel/location before heading back to the UK and we were both really excited to be staying in one of the most historically reknowned hotels in Hollywood. We arrived late on a Saturday night (busiest night of the week) and the male receptionist was more interested in the so called 'talent' than in helping late arrivals. We had booked a twin room for four nights. However when we arrived we were told that there were NO twin rooms available meaning my father and I would have to share a double bed for one night. The following nights they promised to move us. Tired and with no where to go, we had to go with this option. Then came the issue with the 'refundable' charge on the room in case of incidentals. In most, or all of our hotels on this two month trip, the charge was for approx \u00c2\u00a3200 per hotel room, per stay. However, the receptionist stated we would be charged the full amount of the stay. Handing over our credit card (which was clear may i add!) they stated they could not charge the full amount as it had been rejected. Trying to explain to the receptionist that we would pay in full at the start of the trip with a \u00c2\u00a3200 or there abouts charge on the card, was the hardest thing. He didnt quite understand what i meant and again was more interested in looking at the young girls walking through reception than getting us to a room. I mean if someone offers to pay in full at the start of a stay at a hotel, surely this would be ideal. At now, 12.30pm, extremely tired after a flight from New Zealand we were facing a night....in a doorway! Frustrated and annoyed the receptionst finally put this through but not without making me feel like i'd robbed the place. After a night sharing a room and bed with my dad, we made our way to reception to ask to be moved, only to be told to 'come back at 3pm'. Breaking our day trip short and returning at 3pm, we were given new keys to a room and told a concierge would transfer our luggage to the new room. After an hour wasted, watching the car park below (even though we were promised a view of Hollywood Strip and the Chinese Theatre, at this point id given up arguing and just wanted a room!), i went back to reception to ask where our bags were, only to discover they had lost them!!!!!! Seriously?!?! another hour wasted and our bags arrived after looking like they had been pulled through a hedge backwards. On our departure, we did try to explain our 'experience' to the new female receptionist only to be told they werent interested.

Much of what has been said about the Roosevelt is indeed true. It is dark, and does have a dreary vibe to it, however this adds to the character of the hotel. The modern and simplistic furnishings and decor (or minimalistic, as Thompson refers to it) not only complement the hotel's character, but adds to it. It's location is second to none, lying at the very heart of Hollywood Blvd, where all of the action lies. It's facilities, namely the pool area, mostly live up to the unprecedented standards and experienced by many, and further add to its appeal. The Roosevelt positions itself as a modern, vibrant establishment, however it is let down significantly by a few key points, most of which are exclusive to my particular case. I'd looked into many Hollywood accommodation options prior to making my reservation, and picked the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel based on the above aspects. My booking was via an external agent, and originally a superior king room was reserved for me, with a complimentary upgrade upon checkin. I was required to cancel this reservation and book again, but this time without the complimentary upgrade. I contacted the hotel directly in order to request a high floor, exactly as I had done with my original reservation, and was informed that a note was attached to my reservation requesting so, and that they had also added a note requesting the complimentary upgrade. On arrival, I was allocated a superior king room on the fifth floor, overlooking a rooftop. Although it was always understood that my requests were requests, and not guaranteed, it remained a considerable disappointment for me, however being so jet lagged and lethargic after such a long, sleepless night, I decided not to pursue it. Further, I decided to sleep with earplugs in, due to the erratic and disturbingly loud sound of the air conditioning system, and was able to sleep for a matter of hours until my neighbours arrived back to their room at 1:30am. I could literally hear every word of their conversation, as though they were conversing in my presence, regardless of the fact that I had earplugs in! They were not shouting, screaming, laughing or yelling; it was a conversation that I could hear as clear as day. This was yet another disappointment. The bathrooms, although uniquely decorated, are quite small, and would be to few people's taste. It is for these reasons that I will not choose to stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel again in future.

He found us out by the pool, already knowing who we were and what we were there for, it was like we were hollywood celebrities! He followed up with us every day and when I called the front desk to tell them that the toilet in our room had overflown, he came up to our room and whisked us all away to treat us to a champagne toast. It was a classy way to fix a problem because when we returned to the room everything was as good as new and there was a lovely note from the hotel apologizing for the trouble.

The location was absolutely perfect for us to take in the walk of stars and the sights. Check-in was easy and the staff was very helpful in getting our bags to the room. The hotel is very beautiful, kind of a mixture of old Hollywood with newer more modern accents throughout. While it is a very dark interior, it doesn't feel depressing or old. The room was on the small side. We had 2 queen, maybe even full, beds. There was a flat screen TV and a fridge with the honor bar. The bathroom was TINY. Hardly had room to move for one person never mind my kids. We had a great meal at the restaurant downstairs, even though the service was a bit slow. My main negatives about this hotel are: -the hotel is definitely better suited for the grown up customer. At 2:00 AM we discovered through the paper thin walls that the couple next door had just returned from partying and wanted to chat for the next 3 hours. We could hear every word spoken. We actually kicked in the very loud AC to drown their voices. -the room was adequate but not as nice as I expected based on the rest of the hotel decor. The rug appeared a bit worn and dirty. The bathroom was ridiculously small. -No Marilyn Monro mirror as described in the website. We were told the room it was in had received a renovation recently and it was never put back in place. My husband and kids were quite disappointed at this. -the pool area, while beautiful, appeared to not be a place to bring kids. An older scene was definitely in place during our stay.

And all of this continues to evolve & improve over time. After 10 years on the road, I'm convinced that you will not find a cooler, more fun, better managed, better staffed, more diverse, and ultimately better value hotel. I travel a lot (over 150 days per year) and am lucky to stay at high-end hotels everywhere I go. I'm extremely picky about the hotels I select and have very high expectations. I've stayed at all of the higher-end/trendy hotels in LA (both W Hotels, the SLS, the Four Seasons, the Fairmont, Chateau Marmont, the Viceroy, the Standard, the Beverly Hilton, etc, etc.)...the Roosevelt continues to be the best and the only place I ever want to stay. The property itself is gorgeous (a historic hotel with the elegance of old Hollywood....but beautifully upgraded with a modern/hip style). There are many different rooms and suites so you can always find something that fits the occasion. The location is also great...right in the middle of Hollywood but central to everything else you'd want to do in LA (except the beach which is about 30 mins away). The venues at the Roosevelt are all Sure Bets...you can't go wrong with any of them. There's the Tropicana lounge out by the pool (a fun time catching some sun during the day or after dark when it turns into a hip outdoor lounge under the stars), the Library Bar (a unique place for special drinks), the Lobby Lounge (beautiful area with painted ceilings and a fountain...nice plush couches for sitting with your date or friends/colleagues), Teddy's (intimate venue and one of the hot nightlife spots in Hollywood), 25 Degrees (a gourmet burger bar with the best burgers in LA...and open 24 hours a day). Public (a new high-end restaurant with excellent food) just opened. The Spare Room (exclusive modern-day gaming lounge & bar..includes 2 bowling lanes) and Beacher's Madhouse (amazingly fun & unique experience...unlike anything you've ever seen....you'll want to go back for more) also just opened. The staff is friendly and truly exceptional...they go above & beyond to provide outstanding service. They also do a great job balancing a professional/respectful approach while making you feel comfortable & welcome. The hotel has many celebrity, VIP, and demanding guests...and the team at the Roosevelt has a great knack for making/keeping their customers happy. Not that everything can be 100% perfect 100% of the time, but when it's not they care and quickly make it right. I've been extremely impressed by all the teams at the hotel including Reservations, In-Room Dinning, Housekeeping, Front Desk, Bell & Front Drive Staff. Ingrid (who runs the Front Office), and Mark (who runs the Bell Staff & Front Drive) are on top of their game and some of the best in the hospitality industry. The clientele at the Roosevelt is upscale...many fun & beautiful people. Lots of celebrity encounters (you never know who you're going to bump into there or who you'll end up having a drink with out by the pool). I've introduced and referred many people to the Roosevelt and all of them have become frequent guests.

The location is superb for exploring Hollywood, with the Graumans Chinese Theatre and the walk of fame on your door step. Plus many other sights, all with in walking distance. The hotel is also a short walk from a Metro station with Universal studios being one stop away. It has a great restaurant and bar in Dakota's and the pool bar Tropicana is buzzing of a weekend with a young good looking party crowd. If you are looking for something a bit more laid back then 25 Degrees is great. It has superb burgers, one of which very nearly defeated me. But when food taste that good, why not indulge! I would also recommend visiting Yamashiro. The restaurant offers great Asian food with a twist and the cocktails are even better. If you like Mai Tai's especially, this is the place for you. Yamashiro also offers great view's of Hollywood from a hill side location. If you are staying at the Roosevelt, Yamashiro is only a short journey away. The accommodation itself all though not the biggest of rooms was also a delight. With a pleasant modern design and luxurious bedding, making the job of getting up in the morning a difficult task. The bathroom, again was a bit small but with great facilities. The shower was powerful, which was needed after a hard days sight seeing or a hard nights drinking. I am sure that Hollywood has a many number of superb hotels that also have a lot to offer, but if I return to Hollywood the Roosevelt will unquestionably be at the top of my list. The corridors to the room are adorned with pictures of stars of years past and some present, each with an interesting story to accompany the great shots. The pictures also continue in the rooms.

Same thing, the room needed to be refurbished and the bathroom was the same size as the smaller room.

We call down to the friendly staff and to send someone up to collect the fruit because who wants the fruit when you see a roach nearby. The person that picked up the fruit didn't get rid of the roach they were sending someone else up for that which took too long so my husband got rid of the roach himself. When the guy finally arrived he had a can of Raid with him, I'm glad my husband threw the roach out the window then have our room sprayed with Raid.

My colleagues and I have never stayed here so we took a leap of faith when booking our trip to LA. I arrived on a Sunday evening and it took about 20 mins from the airport in a cab to get to the hotel. Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a junior suite. I was really impressed by the decor and how boutique the hotel was. I headed up to my room and was really pleased with the space - 2 closets, a king bed, couch/lounge area and a nice sized bathroom. The hotel location is great if you're looking for the Hollywood experience. it's central to the Chinese theater, Kodak theater and the walk of fame. You literally walk out your door and are in the middle of iconic Hollywood. The restaurants at the hotel are great. 25 degrees has good breakfast options and Public Kitchen was reasonably priced, amazing food. Highly recommended. Plus, you'll definitely see a celeb or two. The Pool bar was a hot spot and is surrounded by cabana hotel rooms. So if you're looking for a quiet night, do not get a room there. The Spare Room is the new bar that just opened on the 2nd floor. Feels very exclusive and has a 30's Speakeasy feel. 2 bowling alley lanes and lots of board games to play with while you enjoy amazing cocktails. Some of my coworkers did complain that their rooms were not ideal. They did try to get upgraded but even then, there were issues with room size.

I wasn't planning to spend a penny on incidentals, and this information was not on ANY of my booking documents. This happened to me at the other hotel I stayed at in California as well, although I have never had it happen elsewhere. I for one resent being charged undisclosed fees for services I haven't used.

My business colleague and I chose this place based on positive things we had heard and the great location. When we arrived, there was an odd odor (think kitty litter) in the check-in area and one of our rooms was not ready. When the rooms were finally ready, we were told we had to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs to our rooms. No elevator. No ramp. No one to help with the bags. What a first impression. When we got to our room, the front desk person said we were in the \"upgraded rooms\" by the pool. The rooms were clean but fit for someone who was there to party as the first view was large bottles of alcohol and condoms on the snack platter. Since we were there for business, we did not think this room was the best fit for us. We then left the room to have lunch by the pool. The staff was so aloof and unhelpful but we stuck it out anyway and remorsefully ate among the men ogling the topless women around the pool. This was around 1pm on a Weds. We left and went to a business meeting and returned 4 hours late to request a change of room since the music playing from the pool was so loud. The reservations person on the phone was very kind and helpful but the rooms we were put in were dark, stains on the carpet, red lights in the bathroom and you could hear the street noise as if the windows were open. It was far worse than the first room. So my colleague and I decided to leave the hotel altogether. The front desk felt a little bad that we were canceling our reservation but the parking guys insisted we pay $36 for the 45 minutes we had parked at the hotel the entire day. Shocked by the request, we handed them our credit card and said what a horrible way to treat unhappy guests at your hotel. Then the parking guys told us that their credit card machine was broken and we had to go get cash, pay the $36 and then we would get the car. We could not believe it! We refused and after a lot of back and forth, they finally let us go without paying the parking. We could not wait to get out of there!! We went to the Beverly Hills Hilton and felt like we were in heaven there after our time at the deplorable Roosevelt. On our way out, there was a couple in the elevator who told us they had changed rooms twice but were still unhappy. Oh we could relate!! This hotel is best for people who want to party and don't mind really bad customer service or carrying their luggage up a flight of stairs to their rooms.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the old Hollywood atmosphere...Don't agree with the bad reviews\u201d", "Author": "odyssey_1977", "ReviewID": "UR99480660", "Content": "We stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt for 5 days in early November 2010. We had preconceptions about the hotel because we had read so many reviews about the place being snobby and unwelcoming unless you were a Hollywood socialite....but we found it to be quite the opposite, and ended up really enjoying our stay. While I agree that it IS pricey, considering its age and the fact that the rooms are quite minimalist, I think it was still good value. We would have had to pay the same or more to stay at the London or the W. When else are you going to get to stay in a hotel where Marilyn Monroe lived, and where the first Oscars were held? Anyway, so, we had a hire car which we drove in from LAX, found the parking very easy when....you are best to come up Sunset Blvd and turn left onto N Orange Dr instead of going all the way up to Hollywood Blvd. The valet is at the back of the hotel and not ON Hollywood Blvd. The valet were the most attentive we experienced anywhere in the US, and I honestly can't imagine they could have treated us better if we had been celebrities. I believe the parking was $35 a day, and we took our car out once or twice a day so with tips it does become expensive, but I can't see how you would do without a car in LA. We saw more expensive parking in San Fransisco though, at $45 a day. Checkin staff were extremely gracious and friendly. Our bags arrived in our room very quickly too. The room was very simple. We had the most basic room with king bed. It had a well stocked mini-bar and good in-room entertainment. We had room service from the 25 Degrees bar one night very late and it was delicious.....you have to have their sweet potato fries with blue cheese sauce....so good! Thier signature burger was really good too.....just don't be shoked at a $100 bill for a couple of burgers and fries (including tip). It was a good burger OK? We went to the pool, had no problems at all. Nobody tried to stop us or tell us it was for invited guests only. The pool area was really nice, although we didn't end up swimming because it was too cool. I can't say that it isn't compltely manic at other times when they are hosting a party, but it was fine when we were there, no issues at all. The location of the hotel had its pros and cons. If you want to check out Hollywood Blvd and do the typical tourist stuff like take a tour of stars homes, check out the Chinese Theatre and Madame Tausads then you really couldn't get a much better location. Hollywood Highlands mall is just a few minutes walk too, which gives you one of the best views of the Hollywood Sign that we saw the whole time. I personally didn't LIKE Hollywood Blvd, it was just very tacky and touristy, and at night it was very seedy. There is nothing really ON Hollywood Blvd at night, but it is very central to all the clubs. I kind of wish this Hotel had been in another neighbrhood, then it would have been pretty much perfect for our needs. We found we were sick of that area within a day. The actual hotel is just beautiful to look at, and all the bars and restaurants were really stunning. Take the time to wander around and have a look at the ground floor and see all the history of the place. It really is stunning. All in all I would return here so long as I had a car and could get out of the Hollywood Blvd vicinity regularly. The room was very clean and I loved their body products in the bathroom. Don't expect any bargains at the Roosevelt, but so long as you know this ahead of time I think you will enjoy it.

I have to admit, I was disappointed. It was an upgraded non-smoking room, and although it's been 'completely renovated,' the room smelled musty and of stale smoke. The paint job was sloppy and the furniture was beat up. The A/C had an incredibly loud drone, and could only be drowned out by the outdated television with bad reception (what 4/5 star hotel doesn't have flat screens?). It should also be noted that there are no bathtubs - it's a shower only. It would have been nice after a long day of amusement park rides and fighting traffic to soak in a hot bath; you can't go to the pool (and there's no hot tub I'm aware of) after 8 p.m. as it closes for the Tropicana club. Overall, I'm sure the penthouse suites are first-class and pristine, but the rooms on the lower end clearly did not receive the same care and attention to detail. Parking at the hotel is $30/day, which should be added to the price at booking instead of coming as a surprise upon arrival. There's nowhere else to park, so you're stuck paying it. To the Roosevelt's defense, I've found that this is common in L.A., but it would have been nice to be aware of this beforehand, especially to wary, unknowing tourists. Hotel staff was genuinely friendly and helpful; they brought in an air freshener ion machine which helped slightly with the odor and staff also offered a different room. The maid service was thorough and the valet guys were pretty quick. Again, service upgraded this hotel when the rooms didn't. The hotel's location is key if you want to do the Hollywood tourist experience; it's right across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theater and there are several great restaurants (Katsuya, Ammo, Dakota, etc.) in the area where you can spot celebrities enjoying a meal.

The common rooms are splendid to look at and if you want to see a building from a bygone era, in California, this is a very good example. Also, Grauman's Chinese Theater ,directly across the street, is a beautiful movie palace & one of the best I've seen thus far. Also, not to be missed is El Capitan Theater, on the same side of the street as The Roosevelt, about 1/2 a block away. The good: we paid for a standard room, in the lower price bracket (with 2 queen beds) & were rewarded with every thing I asked for in the notes section, when reserving & received a large room overlooking Hollywood Blvd. The bathrooms are circa 1927 however, so don't expect an spa tub or as many square feet as we are used to these days. The bathrooms have been redone and are nice, but not luxurious. The linens were nice also & the beds comfy. The check in staff was excellent & Mark, the head of the valet battalion was, well remarkable & was \"on it\" as far as I could see. We did have an instance where our keys were left if in our car, unlocked, which was alarming in a neighborhood where most anything can happen & most likely does. But, it was fine in the end. Just waiting for your car, at least when we were there is a genuine Hollywood who's who experience there, so time passed quickly. They even offered the managers safe for my valuables, after we checked out & put our luggage in storage. Room service was an unexpected surprise in that the food was good, the staff in the kitchen & deliverer's quite pleasant, plus the prices were reasonable. Amazing! The not so good: the carpet in our bed chamber in room 915 was in my opinion gross. It was rippled & felt crunchy under foot & this is the first 4 * & above I've sadly had to say that about. At $300.+ a night I expect to feel I am in a luxurious space & I didn't, when it came to the overall feel of our room. The hotel has undergone renovations & the rooms are meant to have a modern feel, which they do, but unfortunately (again) the furniture looks worn & nicked and in the case of the desk chair, really bad. Plus there was no place to sit for breakfast in our big room. That was a miss on the designers part for sure. One more thing, that is in no way controllable by the hotel staff is even on the 9th floor, the noise from people on the street on Hollywood Blvd. goes on into the wee hours. If you have kids or you sleep lightly you may consider something faces away from the street or a super high floor. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves while we attended the AFI Film Fest & seeing all the red carpets being layed down everyday at Grauman's Chinese Theater, from our rooms view, was wonderful. Everything I requested we received with a smile & you cannot ask for more than that from a hotel. My husband gave it a thumbs up & if the crunchy carpet issue is resolved, I will too.

Also on a night time it was a great area for people watching and having a cocktail. The only slight draw backs of this hotel was that it was $30 per day for valet parking which I would'nt mind but we had we wait at least 20 minutes every time for our car as there was always and event or party taking place. The only other thing which was annoying was the fact that when you went to bed you were woken up without fail through the night with loud music blaring from the rooms either side of you, it was clear that the people who book these rooms use them to party not to sleep, which is fine but it wears thin when it happens every night.

Hardly anybody uses the pool anyway. We had dinner at The Bridge restaurant and can thoroughly recommend the John Dory Fillets. The 25 degrees restaurant on the lobby level is good for breakafast and the who's who of Hollywood seem to like it as well. On our 4th day we had a disaster hit our family. My 7 year old daughter fell off the bed and broke two bones in her forearm. The hotel safety and security team immediately took over and ordered an Ambulance to take her to the LA Childrens Hospital. The hotel staff never left our side and escorted her to the Ambulance. I briefly left the hospital to return to our room after midnight to find a Teddy Bear, cookies and a glass of milk for my daughter in the room. Unfortunatley she was still in hospital preparing for surgery. I returned to the Hotel 26 hours after the accident with my daughter (and the Teddy Bear) and we went to thank the staff at the front desk. They couldn't believe that it had taken so long and offered our children 2 milkshakes to be sent to our room. Within 15 minutes not only did the 2 milkshakes arrive but also 2 additional milkshakes, 4 burgers and 4 boxes of fries as well.

I booked a twin room with 2 beds for my teenage son and myself two months ahead. I booked here because of its location and the fact that it would be a great \"Hollywood\" experience for my 14yr old son for a night before going to Anaheim. I paid $320 AUD for a twin room. Upon checking in i was told i was getting a King Bed. I showed my booking confirmation that my travel agent gave me for a booking with twin beds. The receptionist Marie i think her name was, (part Aisan lady) insisted she never had a booking for twin bed despite the proof i had in my hand. The other receptionist (very long hair to her waist) although i had no dealings with her one on one, was very unfriendly to the point of rude to customers and treated everyone like they were second rate citizens. My son and i had the pleasure of observing her whilst trying to sort our issues out! My receptionist said they were fully booked and couldn't help me. I insisted it wasn't good enough and for the price i was paying and the two months notice they had of my booking, that i want what i had booked and paid for. She refused to put me in another room and said best she could do was to give me a rollaway. I stated that i had booked this accomodation given the location and the quality of the hotel and the fact it did offer two queen beds on the website. She then said well just because you booked twin bedding it doesn't mean you requested twin beds!! At this point i became very annoyed at her patronizing attitude and requested a manager to which she said she will go and talk to one. She then came back and said that there was nothing they could do for me as they were fully booked. We since found out there was Skateboarding competition on and there were a lot of single people that had booked accomodation so i suspect our booking was given away to two singles wanting 2beds. We were given a room and then were called an hour later after settling in, that the room they had given us was too small for a rollaway so we got moved to another room, even though i was told they were fully booked. We then called down to reception 4 times asking for the roll away and were told every time that is was on its way. I suspect the girl downstairs was being very unaccomodating on purpose. The rollaway finally arrived at 8.30pm 6 hrs after checking in. We had attempted to go to the pool during the day and went downstairs to find the place absolutely packed with no where to even sit down with a towel so we decided to flag it and go back to the room. The bathrooms were extremely small and you couldn't fit any more than one in the bathroom at a time. The shower leaked all over the floor and wet everything we had sitting down there. No shower caps, no extra pillows, no extra towels and only one dressing gown for a superior room with king bed. Tony the guy who bought our luggage up was very helpful. Overall it was a very bad and expensive mistake to book here and i certainly recommend that you do not make the same mistake. From someone who stays in many hotels, this hotel has only its name going for it. Since returning to Australia on Saturday i have confirmed through my travel agent and the wholesaler they used to book the accomodation that in fact the hotel did receive a booking for a twin room. But they gave it away because they reserve the right to give it away at any stage and provide you with whatever is available at the time. So be aware this happens with all hotel bookings and relies on the hotel to do the right thing and fulfill their obligations but they can in fact they don't have to. We then went on to spend 4 fantastic days at the Hyatt Regency at Anaheim who i cannot fault. Everything ran smoothly and they couldn't do enough for us.

On arrival, the grumpy reception staff checked us in, and then informed us that because of a private party, the pool and bar area would be closed from 3pm - midnight. After that we were apparently then 'welcome' to use the pool. At midnight! We expressed our disappointment at this, and said that these were the main reasons we had booked this particular hotel and we were only there for one night. The grumpy staff member said 'if this upsets you I can speak to the manager.' We said that it did indeed upset us, as closing off the main amenities of the hotel which we had in effect paid to use was not acceptable. Further more, presumably the party was not just arranged that day, so we should have been notified from the hotel via our travel agent in advance. After a lengthy wait, the slightly less grumpy manager came out and told us we could drive to another pool in Beverly Hills (not the point as we wanted to enjoy some drinks with our friends) or cancel our booking and go somewhere else. This was no help, as we were tired and jet lagged and did not fancy the prospect of driving round LA trying to find somewhere else to stay at this late stage (again, some advance notice should have been given in my opinion). There was nothing else to do but stay, but we were extremely unhappy about the situation, and no discount was offered for the inconvenience. I had thought that they would have offered to pay for a taxi for us to get to the other pool, but no. I see from another review on here that others were allowed to use the bar even when there was a private party on - not the case with us, and it makes me wonder if they do this a lot. Incidentally, we looked out of our room window at 6pm and then 8pm, and the pool area was empty - no-one in sight! We had a quick look round the pool in the time slot we were allowed before 3pm, and I was amazed to see the towels on the beds were quite dirty and had stains on them. They seemed to be newly laid out too. Maybe some people like the idea of stains left by famous people or something..... The rooms were OK; our friends moved room as there was a very noisy generator right outside the window. A failed actor / bell hop grudgingly moved their bags for them. I think a lot of the staff are wannabees or failed actors here, given their attitudes! For a 4 star hotel, as others have commented, we found better 4 stars on our road trip round the states, but I guess you're paying for the location rather than the rooms or the friendly staff........ Be aware that parking is $30 per day at the hotel; it is valet parking, and you are expected to tip the valets every time they get your car for you which puts the cost up even more. You have to hand your keys in when you arrive, so they really prevent you from collecting your car yourself - and rack up the tips. This is quite annoying, as we could see our car from the front door, but had to wait to get the keys, then wait for the valet to go and get it and drive it round for us - a job that we were perfectly capable of doing ourselves, and would have saved us a lot of time - we could have been out of there in a lot less time without all that messing about. Still, I guess that's La La Land for you! All in all, I would recommend this to others based on the location only, and I wouldn't particularly return if I was visiting LA again. The staff need to get over themselves - they are not Hollywood stars - they are there to do the job for which they are paid and serve the paying customers.

We had some amazing cocktails at the Library bar, mixed by a bartender who really knows his stuff. Fresh ingredients, and made to specific tastes - very nice.

For a 4 star hotel in Hollywood Boulevard, that is a bargain. The Hollywood Roosevelt in superbly located on Hollywood Boulevard, within easy access of a number of attractions (Madame Tussauds and the Chinese Theatre are literally across the road). However, in terms of the hotel itself I was a bit disappointed: the public rooms (ie the bars, reception and sitting areas) are beautifully designed and decorated, like you would expect to see in a 4 star hotel. Yet the room in which we were accommodated was quite, well ordinary - more like a 3 star hotel at best. Don't get me wrong, although it was a small room, there was no 'problem' with the room: there was a double bed, decent tv and it was clean and comfortable. I'm no snob that demands the best and an oppulent lifestyle, but I have stayed in 4 star hotels in various locations in the world and the Hollywood Roosevelt rooms frankly don't compare in my opinion. I'm not sure if when they took over, Thomson maintained the current standards of the public rooms but 'toned down' the other rooms to keep prices down and/or make it more affordable?!? Anyway, you'll understand now why I describe it as a hotel of two halves. Internet access costs $10 per 24 hours, and although there is a coffee machine in the room you have to pay for the coffee! I'm not sure if this is standard for LA hotels in prime locations but I've nearly always found such ammenities free in USA hotels. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the quality of the food but we did go to the Library Bar where the resident cocktail mixer (Matt) mixes some wonderful cocktails using locally grown produce, and at a reasonable price. The service from all staff was very good. In sum, great location for the Hollywood area. A fair bargain if you can get a good deal on the rooms instead of paying the standard price.

We also had mixed feelings about staying here due to the mixed reviews, but couldn't understand why a hotel so established, and apparently a hit with 'The Stars' could be that bad. The hotel doesn't look much from outside, showing its age certainly, but once you walk into reception any apprehension leaves you, due to the lovely decor, maybe abit too dark, but nice never the less. We were checked in by a friendly enough girl, but it soon became apparent that all of her smiles and friendliness were fake, asking the same questions several times obviously not listening to a word we were saying. That backed up by the fact she tried to send us to our room without giving us a key, she just wasn't interested, maybe we weren't famous enough for her!. We made our way to our room, up a rickety lift, and through average decor corridors to our room. Our room wasn't particularly big, but was clean, and was done out quite nicely, but its on closer inspection you realise everything is worn, and cheaply made. The room was furnished in dark wood, which in fact was cheap MDF like you would expect from a flat pack. The mattress sat in the same dark MDF frame, which was far too big for the mattress itself, causing a hazard for tripping, and banging your legs. The room had an ironing board and iron. The ironing board couldn't stand securely and would wobble and tilt when used, and also had an old worn cover, were the foam had creased, so you didn't even have a flat side to iron on anyway. The iron was also next to pointless and it got barely warm. The hairdryer also supplied was poor, and was nothing more then a poor travel hairdryer. The room had a mini bar, which was like most, over priced. Bathroom was fine, although our toilet didn't always flush properly. Then it was the general lay out of the room which was crazy and made no sense. There was a dressing table/desk with sockets, but no mirror over it so that couldn't be used for getting ready. The only other socket was the other side of the room, and not near enough to a mirror to use the hairdryer etc!!. We also found that our room was far too warm, but the air conditioning was old, barely gave any cool air, and was ridiculously noisy so we couldn't use it at night!. Then the last thing about our room which I found disappointing, is that the hotel provided a fancy machine for tea and coffee, great, until you realise that you also have to pay for that aswell!!!. After paying to stay in the hotel, they can't even give the guests a complimentary tea or coffee......????, I find that insulting. Now for the hotel itself. In all the public areas of the hotel are lovely, just too dark. The two lifts are rickety, and we even got stuck in one which kept missing out our floor and kept taking us to the 12th, and 9th and 4th floors even though we kept pushing our '6th' button. We then got stranded on the 12th, and used the stairs instead!. - They are an accident waiting to happen. Every time we had any cause to speak to the reception staff they either ill advised us, were clueless, or just weren't interested in us. - They were quite obviously picked for aesthetics rather then product knowledge, or customer service skills!!! If this hotel really is used by famous people, I can't imagine for a second that they would get the same service, and room quality as us, it really is an 'Us and Them' hotel. Don't get me wrong, the hotel in an a fabulous location, literally opposite the Chinese theatre, and with everything in LA being spread out, it was nice to have something on your doorstep, together with a Metro and bus station to get everywhere else.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tumbi Umbi", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "danni_bh2b", "ReviewID": "UR62803516", "Content": "I had a few reviews on there prior to staying at the roosevelt so i wasnt too sure how my stay would be.

I enjoy a classic old school hotel that has been beautifully renovated, but this is not one of them.

So if you are a light sleeper bear this in mind. You also have to pay for everything - no complementary tea or coffee in your room (which can add considerably to the cost of your stay). Although the location is good a short walk at night in any direction soon seems to take you into much seedier areas so a car is probably a good idea if you want to explore. Although food in the hotel's restaurant seemed expensive we can recommend its burger bar which served fantastic burgers and equally delicious sweet potato fries. Generous portions at reasonable prices! So, if you're prepared to put up with some drawbacks (and are prepared to pay) the Roosevelt offers a unique and very interesting view of Hollywood.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wickford", "Title": "\u201cOver rated, over priced, no service\u201d", "Author": "Summer_solstice07", "ReviewID": "UR48756479", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights and if it had been any longer we would have moved.

Our only complaints for this hotel was that there was a private party going on for 2 days at the pool for the labor day weekend from day to night. Only 2 guests from each room can go if they paid $20 per day. Not fair when you are more than 2. Had I known prior to booking that the hotel pool would be off limits I would have opted to stay elsewhere. I have heard this happening before at this hotel and I think that they should post this on their website when not all ammenities will be available to guests during their stay. I think it is unacceptable. We pay for the room expecting to be able to use all facilites that they have to offer unless they are out of order. My other compaint is that the shower leaks all over the bathroom because there is no shower curtain, but only a glass barrier that does not reach the corner walls. By the end of your shower you have a puddle of water all over. This too has been noted in other reviews on tripadvisor and I do not understand why the hotel has not bothered to fix this problem.

The main reason was the location, in that we could walk to everything, also because I wanted to hang around the pool all day, and go to Teddy's at night. The front desk staff were ridiculously rude and full of attitude when we attempted to check in early, so we went to the pool, where the hostess gave us a hard time getting in, and then some guy in a Fedora hat with a little spiral notebook informed us we were not likely to get poolside chairs until 4 p.m. as they were all booked (despite the fact that nobody appeared to be sitting in them). The hostess promptly seated us at the worst table available, which was right next to a bad speaker that was blaring Bon Jovi. The clientele around the pool were total skanks, many of them topless to show off their silicone, I suppose. They appeared to be understaffed that day and it took an hour or longer for the server to bring drinks (which were $16 each). If you're going to spend $400 to hang out by a pool all day, you expect better service. Then we get into our room, which had only 2 towels for the three of us, a bathroom that was so tiny when you sat on the toilet your knees hit the wall, nail polish stains on the carpet, and a smoke detector hanging out of the ceiling by its wires (and we're told this was an upgrade). We showed up at Teddy's at around 1:30 a.m., and were told that we weren't \"on the list.\" I explained we were hotel guests, and we were still turned away. Considering we paid to stay at the hotel, and that there was only a half hour left until the bar closed, I called the front desk to complain and was told by the gentleman who answered, \"Just because you're a guest doesn't guarantee entry into Teddy's...that's just the way it is...\" Subsequently went to the Beverly Wilshire the next night, which is a MUCH nicer hotel, and was treated like royalty by the staff there - and they actually DO have something to be pretentious about!", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTerrible customer service from self-serving staff.\u201d", "Author": "StringStrummer", "ReviewID": "UR33984978", "Content": "Always wanted to try this hotel during one of my concert trips down to Hollywood.

The main lounge at night with hundreds of candles flickering away is simply stunning. Also enjoyed the comfortable pool area, bar. Service is correct, and a bit cool which I happen to like. The staff are not obsequeious like you find in too many luxury hotels. They definately will not fawn over you, yet they magically appear when it is time for a new drink, or to take away a finished plate or used towel. The hotel is also great value (I paid $199) and will remain so as the basic architecture of the building and the rooms mean it will never be able to attract the hyper lux crowd who now insist on enourmous bathrooms, rooms, etc. Your room and bathroom will be small. However, I've never sleep in a bed as comfortable as this with a delightful duvet and perfect pillows.

The Roosevelt Hotel is a gorgeous historic hotel dating back to 1927 which is superbly located in the heart of Hollywood, situated directly across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood & Highland Center. The Hollywood walk of fame runs directly in front of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front entrance. The port cochere is beautiful with large drapes and palm trees which gives it an almost safari-like appearance. Entering the hotel is like stepping back in time. The woman who checked us in was very welcoming and the whole process was very swift. We were given a room on the 9th floor, however once we got to the room we discovered it had 1 king bed in it when we had booked a twin bedded room. A quick phone call to the lobby was all it took and they changed our rooms immediately. We were moved down to the 4th floor, but the new room we were given was quite a lot larger with two queen beds fitted with quality Sferra linens which made them amazingly comfortable, a large walk in wardrobe and a small but funky bathroom with great Kiehls toiletry products. The room was very spacious, modern and clean. One thing which set this hotel apart from all the others we stayed in on our trip was that the Roosevelt was the only hotel to offer complimentary wireless internet which was fantastic! My only minor complaint with the hotel is that there are only two lifts and they are quite slow which means quite a long wait for a lift, but I understand that this is a very old hotel so I can easily look past that. We visited the pool area once and from what I could see it looked like a very nice place to relax and have a drink. The hotel oozes glamour and is absolutely stunning. The historic lobby is gorgeous and is lit with candlelight (I think they are candlelight light bulbs that give the same effect) which gives it a dark and moody atmosphere. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up eating at the restaurant Dakota which is right next to the lobby but it did look very classy. Instead we ate at 25 degrees burger bar which was excellent. Definitely the best burger I have ever eaten! We went back for breakfast the following day and I was equally impressed with their banana and walnut French toast and blueberry pancakes. Overall our stay at the Roosevelt Hotel was nothing short of fantastic. All the staff members were came into contact with were very friendly and accommodating and the hotel itself was gorgeous.

The location on Hollywood Blvd., is ideal, with plenty going on around the hotel. The room they initially gave me had an interesting style -- an urban, efficiency apartment feel to it, as I walked through (intentionally) dimly lit hallways with carpeting that mimmicked a brick road. The room had a brick wall interior (still dimly lit-- by design), hardwood floors, and a pavement like (concrete?) floor in the bathroom. The problem was---------- the noise. There wasn't necessarily that much noise, but, because of the (extremely) poor soundproofing of the rooms, ... you could hear very clearly every detail of the conversations in the rooms next to you. It was as if you were sharing a cabin with people you didn't know. When I called the front desk, to ask to have my room changed... they 'played' naive about it, but, I sensed this was a common complaint with guests, in that they quickly ended the charade, and gave me a more conventional room in a different section of the building. That room was indeed quieter, but very, very small. Personally, I'm alright with that. When I opened the door, and walked into the new room, there were two staff members (not housecleaning) that had shocked looks on their faces (guilty looks). They immediately hung up the room phone, and bolted out of my room. I was kind of ticked, and called to make sure there were no charges against my room bill. Because there was limited shelf space and closet space, the housekeeping crew accidently knocked my shaving kit into the toilet when they were cleaning. Rather than fess up to it, they quietyly put it back in it's original location. That evening, when I got back to the room, I reached in, and noticed the thing was saturated with all of my toiletries wet., and items saturated. There was construction going on on the (street) lobby level, so guests needed to take the (only one operating) elevator down to the ground level, and hike back up a set steps to get outside. I know each of these issues sound minor and random, but, my general feeling is that for the price they charge per room, you should expect good customer service and attention to details. At a minimum, a reasonably quiet room would seem like a fair expectation. I wouldn't recommend the Roosevelt... not for the prices they charge. I'm probably going to try the Renaissance the next time I'm in the area. I don't expect everything to be perfect.. I just want a clean and quiet room to stay in, with minimal interruptions.

Everyone was dressed casually, very arrogant, rude and pretentious. The hotel was overrun with teenaged kids spending daddy's money.

Despite being guests they were told they needed to be with girls and on another occasion they were told they needed to go change their clothes. Being a hotel guest doesn't guarantee entry or that they'll treat you with respect. So, if you're not in the mood for a club scene, as soon as they put up the velvet ropes avoid the pool.", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cA Hollywood Classic\u201d", "Author": "gandgturner", "ReviewID": "UR19941499", "Content": "We've never stayed in Hollywood on a visit to SoCal, so thought we would give it a try.

When I questioned her why, she thought the bags of snacks were unusual at the hotel. OK whatever. Went to dinner and then to the Laugh factory and returned at approx. 1AM.

Through out the night my exceptional room was at the bar back entrance that seemed to be very busy with bottles, glasses and who knows what delivery cleaning ect... I was awoken by a car alarm that would not stop. Now I learn that my exceptional room was across and below a parking garage. Leave my room for breakfast and a nice NYtimes was at my door. Upon my return at approx. 11pm here we go again party at the pool, DJ, glasses, bottles etc... No morning paper the nextday.Upon our return late thursday night the pool was somewhat quiet. Go to take a shower and no towels. OK NO big deal just went to bed. Then at aprrox. 1am the pool area came to life again. On Friday morning my exceptional room now was next to an electrical closet that was being worked on at 707AM. Stuck my head out the door about the noise and the guy said Ok and continued to drill and hammer. Once again this morning No paper.

Ordered room service which was quick and very high standard. We left the next day looking forward to our return trip. On our return trip put in a more smaller standard room, which was fine because that it what we expected to be in. It had adjoining doors and that is when our problem started. At 3am we were woken by the most astounding noise also consider we had a young child with us. A group of youths were using the adjoining wall as a soccer net. There were shouts,screams and bangs which sounded like it was coming from inside the room. After 15 minutes of this we rang the front desk who said they would sort it out. A further 30 minutes later still no end to this noise, our child was quite scared by then. We rang again and explained we had a young family and by now glass's could be heard smashing and foul language clearly heard. Their response was casual but they would sort it. A further 15minutes later and by now they were up and down the corridors with a video recorder which was the final straw.. I made my way to the front desk and spoke to a very sleepy HINT HINT looking night manager whose only solution was for us at 4am to move to another room which i suggested because the noise had not stopped and we had to be up early the next morning.On telling my wife this she rang the front desk a threatned to call the police to sort it [ which is amazing when you see how much security is on in the daytime] and surprise suprise within 15minutes everthing was quiet. We could not speak to anybody first thing the next day due to us leaving for a trip early and nobody available. To cut a long story short it took 2 hours of chasing when we returned to get an solution from the Management about the next night because our child was to scared to stay in the room. We were told to our amazement that it was not the Hotel's policy to throw these type of noisy people out or move them and it would have to be us that moved room's. The only positive thing about this incident is they put us in a suite but the only thing we wanted was COMMON SENSE as we were not after a freebie.

Check-in was fast and easy, our room was a little disappointing, though. We booked (and paid more for) a \"cabana room\" to be near the famous pool and Tropicana Bar, and I think we got the only \"cabana\" room without a pool view or balcony- our first floor view faced the street and some apartments behind the hotel. The room was pretty small...to be expected for an older hotel, but there was literally no where to sit (besides the bed) or put your suitcases, etc. Also, all of the lighting is very dim and the mirrors are tinted. The bedding was awesome...super comfy down comforter, soft sheets! The bathroom was also a little weird- very minimalist with dark lighting, concrete walls, floor, shower...one great thing is the FRESH bath products they give you...love them!! Anyways, despite the room being a little different than what we expected, we were happy to be there and decided to take advantage of the hotel/pool scene. Not your typical pool scene...very \"The Palms\" in Vegas...beautiful young people, dressed-up swim attire, dj spinning club music, security everywhere, and you had to have a wrist band to access the area. The pool/bar is open until 2am and they really get packed (and loud) as the night goes on. Not quite our \"scene\" but interesting to observe nonetheless...also, they had excellent food at the bar! (Just to clarify, I'm 27 and my husband is 29, we frequent bars and the like, so it's not like we are old-foggies who eat dinner at 4pm and go to bed early...) Upon returing to our room later that night (actually 1am) we found not one, but 3 roaches in our room!! We were pretty upset and freaked out, especailly after paying $300 a night. To the hotel's credit, the manager and staff immediately apologized and gave us a new, upgraded room. The manager even slipped that they had had some recent bug problems, and that the exterminator had recently been to the hotel. A little unsettling, but moving on.....Our new room was basically the same set-up, but we had an awesome balcony with a great view of the pool and no bugs!

They also would not allow more than 2 guests per a room at the pool, which only has 90 chairs for the 700 guests to boot. If you wanted a chair you had to get up a dawn and sit in your chair for the entire day or else you would lose it. If you expect to lay out or party at the pool, it is very difficult to do. The hotel also allows their \"guests\" aka, people who greased the pool bouncers and front desk people, to be at the pool making it even more crowded and much harder to get a $15 drink. Don't stay here, you will be disappointed. This is not only my opinion, but many other people who were staying there at the same time also spoke this way and said they would never stay there again.

(don't even bother going to clubs, Tropicana and the lobby bar is where the action is at!!)

It took approximately 45 minutes to get there from the airport. Blame it on traffic and we were going against the grain. We took Super Shuttle (book online or just show up at the counter). This was $15. Not bad, as a cab would have cost about $50 (one-way). It took approximately 25 minutes on the Sunday morning we left. I guess LA was asleep. The hotel upon arrival is like a gem. I was highly jealous to see others get off at the Renaissance (right down the street) and I was upset the b/f booked Roosevelt. However, to my surprise, we arrived at the beautiful Roosevelt. The front of the building does it no justice. It is beautiful inside, hip, colorful with restaurants, lounges and plenty of amenities. Check in was smooth. The concierge offered assistance for dinner that night. There were PCs with printers available for printing pre-boarding passes. Great! We arrived to our room, X35. If they offer any room ending with 35 (i.e. 535, 935, etc.) Do Not Take It. This room is right next to the elevator. After major jet lag and a midnight sickness, the elevator ran all night. You could hear the beeps per floor and feel a vibration. And this was a Wednesday night. What were people doing? Where were they going? I don't know. But don't take this room. Not only is it near the elevator, it is SMALL. Very small compared to the other rooms. After a morning complaint, we were moved to another room on the other side of hall, still a side view. This room was (and I'm not kidding) 2 times the size of our previous room. Plenty of space to walk around, be free, think and not feel so crowded. Again, don't let them put you in a room that ends with 35. After that incident, we were given a 50% discount on the first night. The stay was fine afterwards. Side note: They charge a $150 per night hold on your credit card. With 4 nights, that was a hefty $600, that's not outlined to you upon check in. This hold is for incidentals (room service, etc.) Be careful. That's a huge hold. A wedding took place on Saturday and you weren't allowed to enter through the historic lobby, which is a quicker way to enter and exit the building to get to Hollywood Blvd. Also there was an after party for Barack Obama at the hotel after the Presidential Debates, which blocked off the historic lobby entrance and exit on Thursday. This can be a bit of an issue, if its cold, raining, etc and you have to walk all the way around the building. Not a huge issue but for some it's extra effort. Still the hotel is beautiful. I don't personally suggest the in-house restuarants. They aren't that good. 25 degrees is a rip off. Some liked the burgers, but I didn't but at least they are huge (they fed my fiance and I). The fries were delicious though. Across the street are a pizza place with decent meals on the go and a great and cheap diner (the breakfast was awesome). Less than a 2 minute walk is the Kodak Theater, and much more. This is a prime location if you are looking to stay in LA. I would stay here again, if the Renaissance is booked.

Since we were only staying for one night, I used Priceline which came up with the Roosevelt Hotel. After reading many reviews of this hotel, I must admit that I had low expectations. The review comments that most stood out were small dark rooms and rude staff. I must say that my experience was very different. We arrived at noon, before check-in, but were treated very politely at the front desk. They advised that only one room with two beds was available, it was 'nice' and on the 8th floor, but was handicapped accessible. We decided to take the room and it was lovely. It had views of the Hollywood sign, the Chinese Theater and the Magic Castle. It was also quite large and bright. When we got to the room, we noticed that the shower had been used, a bathmat was on the floor and a towel was in the sink. I called housekeeping, they were very apologetic, and said it would be taken care of. We were not really bothered by this, and assume the room was cleaned while the previous guest was at the pool. (This happened to us once when we were at the pool and our room was cleaned early - we did tell the front desk upon checkout, but have no idea if they relayed the message to the housekeeping staff.) We left to do some shopping and have lunch, when we returned the room had been re-cleaned. The poolside bar/restaurant was really nice and since it was extremely hot, the staff was very obliging and moved an umbrella over to our table to provide shade. About the only negative comment is that there are no ice machines, and ice must be ordered from room service. After returning from the theater we really wanted ice water, so I called room service to ask how long it would take. I was assured that it would only be about 10 minutes, but after 45 minutes, we gave up and went to sleep. Next time, I would just go to the 24 hr. restaurant and ask for a glass of ice. Breakfast in the restaurant was also very good. Other comments on this site have mentioned that the pool area and bar are sometimes closed for private parties, but since we had no intention of using the pool at night, or going to the bar (since my daughter is too young) it was not an issue.

Chose the hotel because we were expecting a little bit of Old-Hollywood chic, and because of it's central location. Room was tiny by American standards. Particularly the bathroom which more closely resembled one from a Japanese capsule hotel. Room was decorated with a frankly disgusting large canvas photograph. Walls were paper-thin (we could hear conversations in the room next door), bed and pillows weren't particularly comfortable (and my partner swears there was bed bugs due to the mysterious bites she kept waking up with), though the TV had a good selection of channels. The hotel istself is so dark and dingy. Even with blazing sunshine outside, it's very gloomy in the lobby. It's also very noisy and busy; there always seemed to be something happening. The doors are also patrolled by angry doorman, who on more than one occasion prevented me entrance into my own hotel! It felt like tryng to get into a trendy nightclub at times. Worst experience by far was on our last night (hoping to get a good night's sleep in preperation for an 11 hour flight!). Having played host to a high-school prom, the hotel obviously allowed a load of the recent graduates to rent rooms. Cue a night of screaming, banging, singing, running around corridors, etc. I've stayed in numerous hotels around the world, and never experienced noise like it. Even my university halls were quieter. At 3am, I finally caved and rang the front-desk. The phone rang for 5 minutes before finally being picked up - \"We'll send someone right up sir\" - which of course they didn't. It got to 4am when I eventually went out into the corridor myself to try and reason with them. In fairness, they did start to quiten down, but it was a draining and restless night to say the least. Ironically, despite the dark gloom of the main hotel, the rooms are suprisingly and dissapointingly bright at night. A combination of the cheap curtains, and the fact a spotlight shines directly at the windows... used to highlight a 50-foot high fashion advetrtisment emblazoned on the side of the building.

At 11 am there were no chairs available around the pool (the hotel allows locals to come use the pool without checking keys, i know because i am local and i have friends who do this). So we were relgated to a sectional couch at the back, a nice spot but unfortunately shady. At 4 pm we were informed our section was going to be cordoned off for VIP and that we would have to move. This was after spending the afternoon and $300+ from the bar/restaurant. The staff was informed if they could find us seats around the pool sitting together we would move, but that aside we weren't leaving until 5. They left us alone for the most part after that. Going back up to our hotel room to ready ourselves for dinner, one of my friends brought a beautiful bottle of champagne for us to drink while doing so. Calling room service I was told they would not send us up flutes or even wine glasses, but we could call the pool and they might send us up some plastic flutes. (WHATever). The pool sent up plastic beer cups. Um, NO! I sent the poor man back downstairs for either plastic flutes or glass glasses. The thoughts of my friend in terms of service versus labor cost, they had to endure 3 phone calls and 2 trips on the part of the server to finally send us up glass wine glasses. If they had done it the first time, it would have been far less hassle in terms of time and money. Either way you slice it, it's ridiculous. I do have to say that the room and our view was gorgeous, they supplied is with Fresh brand amenities (my personal favorite), the sheets and towels were all top quality (even though some of the towels had a Ritz-Calrton label) and we had a wonderful time.

I was excited about staying here but also had a little trepidation because of its young and trendy reputation, and we were neither that young and maybe only slightly trendy. While it does live up to that reputation, my trepidation turned out to be unfounded, fortunately. We arrived at the valet parking and the valets did everything valets should do - open doors, unload the luggage - and did it cordially. I went to the check in desk - the two gals there seemed cooly efficient but without much friendliness. The guy that checked me was more pleasant, a brief credit card glitch was handled quickly and without fuss. We needed, and got a deluxe two queen bed room on the 4th floor of the main building (the only two bed rooms are deluxe queens in the main building), but were told there wasn't room for a rollaway. I think we could have squeezed one in but it would have been tight. The room was a decent size, not very large or small. It had a desk with vase and (fake) flower, a TV stand/cabinet, nightstand, and a mini-bar refrigerator. Fortunately the mini bar didn't have those motion sensors so we could put other stuff in it. Although we didn't consume anything from the mini-bar, the prices were pretty decent for a hotel. The nightstand was a little beat up but otherwise the furnishings were in good shape. There was also a CD player which was good for us as it was kind of a musical trip and we had CDs with us to get in the mood. The room's color scheme was in chocolate brown/ grey/light beige, cooly stylish. The room came with a pill bottle on the nightstand filled with beige and white M&Ms. There were two phones in the room, but one didn't work. I liked the bathroom a lot - while it wasn't very large (about the size of one in an old city apartment) I liked its style, and it had nice toiletries. The view from our room wasn't much, but at least there was somewhat of one - I wasn't expecting much of one because I'd Priceline'd it. Service was good - they handled getting our luggage from car to room and requests for things such as extra towels and glasses (there were only two of each) were handled promptly. One thing that didn't work (or barely did) - the in-room wireless internet. I don't know if we were in a dead spot or if it's like that throughout the hotel. However, there are two countertop laptops connected to a printer in the check-in lobby, use is complimentary. Would've been nice to have had stools to sit on while using them, rather than stand. The common areas of the hotel are dark - very dark, particularly the main lounge/restaurant area. A bit of a pity as it was harder to see the classic old details in the interior architecture. We did eat a late lunch at the hotel's gourmet burger restaurant, 25 Degrees, and I must say that was a delicious, messy burger and great chocolate milkshake. The pool area was very nice - while we didn't swim in it, we went to the pool bar on a quiet Monday night, which made for a mellow time relaxing poolside on the chaises having a couple of (pricey) drinks. The bar hostess was very nice as well.

The room we had was big and we loved the decor. The old lobby is dark but I agree that it adds to the mystique and style of the hotel. We ate at 25 degrees a couple times and LOVED it. Make sure to eat there. It is a bit pricey but worth the money for the best burger I have ever had. We were staying in the hotel during the premier for the movie 300, which was at Graumans. It was exciting to watch the red carpet from our room. The post-premier party was at our hotel on the old lobby floor. They were setting up for most of the day and shut off access from the elevators to this floor. That was a bit of a pain but that's the Roosevelt.

A bit pricey but you have to treat yourself sometimes! The servings are generous anyway. I recommend the pineapple roasted french toast! Tropicana Bar was dead and perhaps is so on weekdays. Too bad the weather was not warm enough to have a swim as they have a fantastic pool. While we were there, CSI Miami was being filmed in the pool area. We snuck a peek and was tempted to run down and ask for autographs! Could not ask for a better location!

Our room was TINY! The rooms I stayed at in hotels in Europe were MUCH larger. They need to bite the bullet, and half the number of rooms at the hotel, but knocking down walls and combining two rooms into one. They had to shave the bathroom door down to get it to swing past the toilet. There were no sheets on the bed. The carpet in the hallways was musty and wet. The decor in the room was depressing and strange. I don't really enjoy looking at a huge fisheye view of an androgenous 70's glam rocker staring at me when I'm supposed to be on a romantic night out. The dark look in the lobby, restaurant, etc.. works. It doesn't work in the room. This place needs a serious makeover. I got my room on priceline, but I still think I overpaid.

Andrea, the concierge, was also great and she actually seemed to want to help and was always smiling. She recommended a restaurant Bella's which was down the road from the Roosevelt. It was Italian and me being Italian I was a little nervous b/c it was right on Hollywood Boulevard, I was thinking tourist trap. But it was really good and the prices were reasonable. So thanks Andrea on that call. The lobby and the halls were very dark like other reviewers have stated but it wasn't bad, it just seemed swanky to me. The elevators sucked though, they took forever (but no big deal, we were on vacation). One night all the keys didn't work in the whole hotel but the staff were very helpful and apologetic so it wasn't that big a deal. They had a glitch in their electronic system. Rooms were fine, no complaints other then sink leaking in bathroom. Beds comfy and rooms were big enough for us. Wi-Fi fine from where we were in our room (408). Not much to talk about, just a normal room, nothing over the top! No ghost stories here, even though I was freaked out before we went from reading other stories. I just was scared a little when I heard any noise.

I found the front desk folks a little snobby, but the bar staff both in the big room and by the pool was really nice. You can't beat the main, candle-lit room with its big, comfy leather couches as a place to hang out with someone else (however, you can beat the drink prices!). I love the history of the hotel (1st Academy Awards held here, etc). My room by the pool (room 121) was cool, slightly dark but moody, with a Sharp flat-screen TV with pay-per-view movies, comfy bed and bedding, good toiletry products, Bose CD player/alarm clock, and the New York Times brought to the room each morning. The chairs by the pools are very comfy, with the oversized fitted towels on each one. The pool is amazing looking. Valet parking is $23/day and includes unlimited in-out priveledges. That's your only hotel parking option. TIPS: 1. Stay in a pool-area room. The hotel rooms in the main tower aren't as interesting in their design. Staying by the pool makes you feel like you're in a small, trendy boutique hotel, plus gives you access to the pool bar if it's really hopping. If you need the space, you can stay in a big suite in the main tower, but then it has the \"big hotel \" feel. 2. I stayed in a room that didn't face the pool. This was cheaper, and would be much quieter in the heat when the bar is hopping. 3. Eat a (expensive) burger at 25 degrees, but split the fries (and you could easily split the huge burger, too). Otherwise, you're in for a huge check. For cheaper eats, Mel's Diner is close by. 4. Have a drink by the pool! So swanky. 5. Book directly with the hotel. They had access to room options that weren't on any travel websites, and my rate was cheaper than the rate a friend paid on Orbitz (PLUS they didn't have my friend's room). I'm sure some have good web-booking experience, but in my experience the only way to really know they'll have your room is to book directly. I buy plane tickets on Orbitz, but book hotels directly for the piece-of-mind. 6. There's a liquor store one block away, which will give you drinks in your room much cheaper than the minibar! GRIPES: 1. I had trouble connecting to the hotel's free wifi, but I was able to get onto someone else's open wifi, so all wasn't lost. The front desk did offer to give me a cable so I could plug into the wall for internet access. 2. VERY small hang-up closet. Four full-sized drawers, but maybe enough space to hang up 12 shirts (the hang-up closet is about 18 inches wide - so if I wasn't travelling alone...) 3. No hooks on backs of doors or on walls for quick hangup of clothes, etc. 4. Desk chair is modern looking, but not soft to sit on. It needs a cool cushion on top of it. 5. My friend's mini-bar wasn't restocked quickly, even after we requested it.

Given the fact it was $28 for 2 glasses of wine in the Tropicana Bar we tended to use our minibar as a fridge rather than consume its contents.

The desk and concierge were all very nice and helpful to us. The room was huge and clean with a very comfortable bed and great bathroom. The clerk made it clear upon check-in that as a hotel guest we were permitted to bring up to three guests to the Tropicana Bar. The policy was clearly stated by them and upheld by the Tropicana staff. We decided to go have a drink at the bar and we found all of the staff very nice and courteous. We really don't understand all of the bad reviews about the rude service. We also ate at the in-house Dakota restaurant and absolutely loved it! We each had a Kobe steak and it was one of the tastiest steaks we've ever had in our lives (and we've had Kobe steak in Kobe). The restaurant staff were also friendly. Yes, the lobby of the hotel is dark - but it's massive and Moorish architecture. It's true to its past. It is what it is and we felt it would have been a shame to turn the lights up and ruin the atmosphere and architecture.

The hotel is also only about a block from the Hollywood/Highland center and the metro stop there. For all of those who say don't take the metro we disagree! We thought it was great! We took the FlyAway bus from LAX to Union Station and the metro the rest of the way to the hotel. It only cost us $4.50! Two weeks later we stayed at the Hotel Mosaic in Beverly Hills which uniformly receives good reviews on TripAdvisor. We agree that it is a great hotel, but we liked the Hollywood Roosevelt more!

Felt like I was in a Dracula film with all the gothic furniture. This darkness seems to be a growing trend with some hotels across the States. I could not find my card key in my bag the lobby was so poorly lit and people were almost walking into each other, I kid you not. My room was frightening. The room was black, the bathroom light was red and to top of it. A huge photo of a man with bright blonde hair in a black jumper was above my bed looking down at me. My friend had to cover it for me with a towel, so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it. They charge to for coffee and teas in you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re room too, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time for me! The only advantages are the great locations near by; if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tourist it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all at your doorstep. None of the staff were rude to me, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plus, but I will never stay here again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame because I had a big group of us going next year, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe to say I will be taking our business somewhere else.

I even heard someone say, \"No, this is not going to happen,\" when she saw our family standing there trying to find a way out.

Generally I enjoy breakfast in bed, but at the Roosevelt I could not wait to get out of the hotel in the morning. To be fair I think whether or not someone likes the Roosevelt depends on what you are looking for in a hotel. So I will list the positives and the negatives. Positives- 1. The front desk was very nice and we were upgraded to the Cabana section of the hotel so we had access to the Tropicana during our stay. I'm not sure what is so great about the Tropicana, but if you are looking for $14 drinks then I guess this is a perk. 2. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food and service were excellent. I ate the veal 2 ways and it was incredible. Negaitves- 1. The airconditioner did not work properly and our room stayed a consistent 79 even though we set the thermostat lower. We were told engineering was working on this, but during our 3 day stay nothing ever changed. 2. The room is very, very, dark. The walls are painted chocolate brown and the lighting is very bad. The unscreened window opens to the street so we did not open the windows. There was not enough light in the room for me to comfortably read a book. 3. You can easily hear you neighbors talking, listening to the radio, or watching TV. 4. The bathroom more closely resembled a jail cell than a luxury bathroom. The room is concrete, the shower is concrete. There is no tub or any hint of luxury. 5. The concierge was not very helpful and insisted that he must make us reservations at restaurants rather than given us some options and letting us make our own decisions. In summary, I would not stay at the Roosevelt again. When getting away with my husband I look for a luxury room and amenitities. It appears this hotel is for people who want to be seen at the pool and the Tropicana bar. The pool is nice, but it does not make up for the lack of quality in the rooms. I would so say the rooms are lower in quality than the rooms in any lower priced chain hotel.", "Date": "June 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGlorified Days Inn\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5374049", "Content": "After reading the reviews posted, I was somewhat skeptical about this hotel.

The AC was loud and didn't work well and the room in general was dirty. The pool was quite nice - if you are 23.

Our suite was pretty nice - a large room with some design-junky furniture overlooking the hills. It had a white leather banquette and a spray-lamp and a lot of interesting art. It was quite a nice room. Got room service once and it was actually very nice and prompt. But the fun kind of ended there; first of all, the other couple booked and paid for a junior suite on expedia. The Roosevelt told them there were no more junior suites and because they went through expedia, they wouldn't be able to get the suite. They were relegated to a standard room - which was about 1/5th the size of our suite. Beware - don't let the front-desk people at the Roosevelt take advantage of you like that. I think there are several reviewers on this site that had similar experiences. If you pay $150 for what expedia advertises as a \"junior suite\", you should get a \"junior suite\". I've contacted expedia about this. The hotel should quit this consistent and suspect practice. Moving on, the ceiling vents in all the rooms on our floor were under a well-lit catwalk under the roof. So maintenance could (and did) get to look into the room, and you could hear whatever was going on in every other room on the floor. When people partied until 4:a.m. then had a fight, my husband and I were privy to every last dramatic detail. When another family ordered room service 3 hours later, we knew what they ordered. The alternative was to turn on the A/C which sounded like a jet engine. The vents in the other couple's room were worse. Bathroom was very small, out-dated. The main ventillation was into the bedroom (not good). The toiletries were great - but only *some* rooms got lotion and body-gel while others got shampoo and generic soap. The more I think about that, the angrier I get: Just give us all the good stuff! How much could you be saving? The Roosevelt's club is evidently the hottest club in the town. But as a guest, you can't go to the club. Don't try it, don't think about it, just leave it alone. It's not going to happen unless you book a $400 cabana. I talked to a guy who had a suite and tried to get in the club. A bouncer took him aside and told him he'd let him in if he paid him $350. Elevators: mind-boggling. Took some people 45 minutes to go down 12 floors. I got acquainted with the fire-well by the 2nd day. OK so the interiors of this place look nice and our room had a lot of style to it. There just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the snobbery and alienation. I can't remember a time I paid so much to stay at a place denied me full access to its ammenities. Bottom line, this place cuts way too many corners because it thinks it can get away with it on unwitting tourists. If you want to get treated better, stay at the Le Montrose - same price but way more services and seamless luxury. Or the Renaissance, or the Bel Age. Or the Standard, or the W.

A little trouble getting to the place - Hollywood Boulevard closed, parking lot closed until I motioned to the security guard and kindly told him I was checking in. Which he did without question. This was a true test: I arrive in my capris, t-shirt and flip flops, straight off the plane. The hotel is swarming with sequined gowns and tuxedos, humping with the post-emmy party in the lobby. Despite my clearly NON-celebrity status, everyone was VERY friendly - valet, check in staff, bellman. Reviews are true regarding the private parties in the lobby and pool. But I was able to enjoy both areas during my five day stay. And when you're in Hollywood - are you really hanging out at the hotel anyway? And isn't part of the attraction to a Hollywood hotel the chance star sighting? Those are the people in those parties. Room service was probably the best I've ever had: timely and absolutely delicious! I travel extensively and am VERY particular about the hotels I stay in. I have stayed in many \"european\" style hotels - which is what this is - and find them very comfortable. But, I realize that not everyone is into that, and if you're not, then you indeed won't like the Roosevelt.

The general impression we got from the hotel is that unless you are attending an event and / or are a celebrity, you are not valued. This is confounded by the fact that we were told that 95% of guests are attending private events. It felt like we couldn't use the facilities that attracted us in the 1st place.

The hostess and wait staff were very courteous and fun. After dinner we went to the pool festivities (didn't have to wait in the huge line) where we encountered Kimberly Stewart and Hank Azaria. The pool festivities were hopping and the drinks were great! Great place for anyone who wants to have fun and possibly hook up. At the end of the festivities, we went back to our awesome room. I would've had a good night sleep had it not been for the people walking and talking throughout the hallways during the early morning hours. After a few hours of tossing and turning (5:30 AM), we finally called the front desk to get the noise level toned down in the hallways. The walls must be really thin because 5 minutes after the call, I heard security asking the folks in the hallway to keep it down. The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in a looooong time! The only crappy thing is I am now ridding my ankles and lower shins of the bruises I obtained from the platform bed. My bad, I just kept accidently banging my legs on it everytime I passed by the bed (forgetting it was platform).

Many of them quite honestly looked like hookers or call girls, some were obviously transvestites, many with multiple men on their arms and overcrowding elevators to the upper floors with their \"partners.\" We could not get to our room. We tried in vain to find stair wells. After wandering through crowds of people and smoke, we finally were able to cram into an upward-bound elevator and managed to get to our room. The noise continued even on the 10th floor til well past 5:00 a.m. I was appalled to see that there was virtually no hotel security, anyone could wander in off the street and apparently did, and appalled that they allowed this sort of activity to go on so openly. What really got me though was seeing a family with young children in the same dilemma, trying to get up to their rooms. I can only imagine what the children must have thought. I wrote the hotel an email about our experience, hoping at least for an apology. We got no response at all; we never have. My family and I will never stay there again under any circumstances.

Nov. 20, 2004. We had driven out with some friends earlier that year and were interested in all the paranormal things we had heard and read about. We were also breathtaken with everything it had to offer, thus making us want to return to stay. So I looked online to see what their rates were, but I called to make the reservation. I booked a junior suite for one night at the price of $189, plus an $18 valet fee, but with unlimited in-and-out privileges. The valet shouldn't really be that much because the valet staff was average. The check-in staff was very polite. We were given a beautiful, large room, with a view of Hollywood Blvd. that we didn't even ask for! We were so excited! The room had a very modern CD player, a big swiveling TV, a couch, coffee table and chair, a dresser w/ a minibar.. a big beautiful COMFY bed with plush soft linen. The bathroom was awesome. It had an old-time Hollywood feel to it, and it included an amazing shower and a separate bathtub. Now i read a lot of the reviews and everyone's complaining about how the pool wasn't available because of renovations. If you're really going to be that intent on using the pool and/or jacuzzi (like me and my b/f were), find out! All i had to do was go online and click on the pool and it said it was going to be closed. I didn't freak out because I WENT PREPARED. However, the staff did inform me that they had a deal going with the hotel across the street (i think it's called renaissance, not sure) that the roosevelt guests could use their pool. Well, before attempting to walk over in our bathing suits, we took a stroll to inspect it. It was an extremely long walk through very public places where we did not want to walk in our bathing suits, wet or dry. And when we got to that hotel, we asked the front desk if they had a jacuzzi and the woman looked at us as if we were extreme idiots and huffily replied no. She made a horrible impression on us. thank god we weren't staying there. So, yes, we were disappointed about not having the pool, BUT we were prepared. Never assume anything, because obviously it leads to disgruntled people and disappointment. But it can be easily remedied by just asking the question \"is the pool open?\" One more thing that I should mention. I also read in a lot of reviews about how the staff cares more about any functions that may be going on in the hotel rather than their own guests. I disagree with that but I had a similar issue. My boyfriend and went to take the stairs up to the main entrance that leads you to Hollywood Blvd. There were no signs or anything saying that something was going on. There did happen to be a wedding and they were in one section of the room that wasn't in the way of the exit. But someone working the party(?) ran over and immediately stopped us and said \"sorry you can't go through here!\" He got right up in our personal space and was very rude about it. We were innocent..we didn't know. So, if they're going to have any sort of event...especially where this wedding was, make a sign. Other than that, we absolutely can't wait to return to the hotel...when we have money..because yes, it is expensive, but it's a wonderful experience.

There are some problems, but I think many of these are attributable to the fact that the hotel is old, and in an area that is only now receiving some attention for revival. It takes a little imagination to see the Golden Era of the though the hotel has been recently refurbished. For whatever reason, they don't use the front entrance as the main entrance anymore, which is a shame because your first impression is of a cramped den-like area, rather than the rather grand lobby where you can picture the way the hotel was \"back in the day.\" Details--like not being forewarned that the pool was closed for renovation, the overpowering smell of the deodorizers in the hallway and room, a worn school folder for the stapled menu and ratty photocopies of other information, and the lack of a top sheet on my bed--leave a sour taste for a $199 room. It could be that the nicer more expensive rooms are, well, nicer. The management company really should get its act together fast because it is almost there. I found all the staff really eager and helpful except, interestingly a front desk manager-type who was obviously sick of the service industry, waiting for that big break. On the flip side, the rooms are very recently redecorated, (this is not your grandmother's hotel) have CD players, down comforters, room service was outstanding (the food and the service) and the vibe is retro/funky/cool. The include a hip jazz/house music CD in the room to give you some of the background music that you hear in the lobby as you check in. The restaurant and bar look nice, although I did the room service option. The lobby is really grand. I hate L.A., so most of my negative feelings stemmed from feeling like I needed a bath the minute I got into the hotel just from riding there from the airport.

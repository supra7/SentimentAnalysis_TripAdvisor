{"Reviews": [{"Content": "super alternative to a hotel My husband  I stayed in the Spa Suite December 13 - 15, 2008. It exceeded every expectation. Our room was on the second floor and was actually three seperate areas. The bedroom had a wonderful king sized bed that was very comfortable. The galley-type kitchen was fully functional - microwave, oven, dishwasher  refrigerator. The fridge was stocked with wine, cheese, quiche, milk, oj  water. Bagels, danishes, oatmeal, coffee were also right there at your fingertips. The bathroom was simply unbelieveable! Jacuzzi tub, sauna, seperate shower and a fire place. If you're looking for a romantic getaway - this is your place. The moment you walk into the house, you feel as though you're in your own private home. The Inn is in walking distance to the subway  neighborhood restaurants. It was just such a delightful alternative to the standard hotel. We really felt special and are looking foward to returning.

A beautiful apartment a haven from the hustle and bustle of days of sightseeing and shopping! Once the door was closed it was probably the closest to New York living experience ever! The apartment was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and all the personal touches provided - home baking waiting for us when we returned every evening, bedding and towels changed every day - I cannot praise the Inn enough!

The Suite was uniquely decorated with all the comforts anyone might require..

This wonderful Boutique Hotel allowed me to enjoy the energy and excitement of the big city knowing that a quiet space was just steps away.

It was so nice to know that our home was waiting for us all warm and inviting after a hypothermic day sightseeing!The Vermont suite is the cheapest option of the bunch probably because it's on the ground floor (with its own entrance) and the bedroom is below in the cellar (with little natural light of its own). This just added to the ambience and character of the suite making it more homely during the fall/winter months. I may prefer to be in one of the other suites during the summer though.Ruth is very welcoming and the housemaids are fabulous. There are a veriety of foods provided from fresh produce to bagels, croissants and cakes that were replenished each day.The kitched was small but perfectly functional for our needs. I dare say you could cook a full thanksgiving roast in there if you wanted to but most of the time we just eat out locally up around 86th street area or during the day while siteseeing.I wouldn't recomend this specific suite to anyone who may have trouble with a metal spiral staircase as although it was gorgeous to look at and fine for us 30 something honeymooners, I can imagine it might be a bit of a handful for some less able guests.I would definatley recomend this hotel for a honeymoon or special occasion, or those of you with dollars to spend who only want the best that NYC has to offer. I really think that this probably is the best most luxurious place you can find in NYC, and even more so if you don't want all the hussle  bussle of a normal hotel.Finally, I personally think the location was very good. Its just a few minutes walk to the subway and then only another block or two to central park. We used the subway and busses most but did walk down to Time Square from the hotel once, and it was a nice walk via Columbus Circle down Broadway and although I cant remember exactly I guess it probably didn't take much longer than 30 minutes.", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR853343769", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Dean32"}, {"Content": "Perfect Inn New York We stayed in the Spa Suite and found not only the room to be excellent but the service as well.

Because my partner and I were relocating to New York City, we thought this place sounded perfect for the two weeks we would need to find an apartment. We were hoping to find something that would feel more like a home than a hotel and Inn New York City was just perfect for us!The Inn is basically a brownstone on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The owners see to it that you are well taken care of, but do not interfere when they are not needed, so you really feel like you have your own apartment in the city, and they even do your laundry upon request.We ended up staying in the Opera Suite on the main floor as it was the only one available for the entire 2 weeks we would need. We were very pleased with the arrangement of the suite. There were no stairs to climb (other than the steps outside), which was helpful for us at the time. Inside the suite we had a lovely firm - and very comfortable - queen sized bed facing the fireplace. We only used the fireplace one night, but Ruth, one of the two owners, needs to come and light a firelog due to too many mishaps of guests in the past, but it was lovely all the same. You do need to be aware, however, that the owner needs to be notified in the afternoon if you would like a fire in the evening. We also really loved having a kitchen with everything you could ever need to cook and we enjoyed preparing some of our own meals from time to time. They also leave fresh sweets, fruits, and flowers every afternoon along with some basics such as juice, milk, and quiche in the fridge.Our suite also had a baby grand piano in it along with many piano books and opera magazines - great for the classical music lover!The only downside for me is that one night I fell terribly ill with food poisoning and was not able to get a hold of anyone in the inn as it was the middle of the night. There was an emergency contact number for the inn by the phone, but nobody answered. As we were new to the city, we were hoping they could put us in touch with an emergency doctor. I did eventually find a house doctor online who was able to come to the inn the following morning - which was a lifesaver!Overall we were very satisfied with our stay here as it was greatly helpful in our transition of moving to the city.

You would not expect 24-hour room service from your virtual Aunt, and you will not find it at Inn New York City. But the merits of this elegant, genteel establishment far outweigh and compensate for the lack of facilities on offer in more renowned hotels.Ruth, the owner, operates a discrete and mannered refuge on the Upper West Side. There is no hotel sign and the Inn both looks and acts like a polished private residence. Residents and owner are quiet and take other guests into consideration: guests in the Opera Suite are asked not to play the baby grand piano after 10pm as the residents of the Spa suite upstairs similarly refrain from using their whirlpool tub after hours. Ruth asks for a discreet buzz on the button at the bottom of the stairs as you leave, so that the housekeeper can go into your room, and is willing to come at any time up to 9pm to light the fire in your bedroom. The d\u8305cor is eclectic, part art deco, part French, part Edwardian, part 1950s floral chic: not quite over the top, but lovers of minimalism should look elsewhere. The Inn\u9225\u6a9a website has four lovely short films with piano music to illustrate each suite and the anticipation they create does not disappoint. There are heavy drapes and wooden New York shutters. The house feels loved, polished and personal. Aged graceful wooden cabinets have style, even if they creak a little with age, along with some floorboards. There is a small but full kitchen, again slightly aged but utterly charming and with more utensils than you will ever use during your visit, all of which looked as they had been gathered with care at antique markets. Fabrics have been chosen with care and thought, as have the individual pictures, lamps and soft furnishings. Opera magazines, old copies of magazines, sheet music, soft throws and books are scattered throughout the suite. Wardrobes and individually chosen armoires reinforce the feeling that this is a residence rather than a hotel. As the day fades into darkness, the Opera Suite comes alive with gorgeous dimmed lighting, and the fireplace. Make sure you take someone with you who can play the honey-tone baby grand, preferably slow jazz or melancholy chansons. The subway is one block away, taxis are always available as are private cars if you need one. The coffee shops, restaurants and upmarket boutiques on Columbus are a few minutes away, the Lincoln Centre and cinemas five minutes walk, Central Park no more than seven. Ruth fills the Suite each day with pastries, cakes, cheeses, crackers, chocolate, fruit and a myriad of little treats. Basic supplies are provided, more than enough for breakfast each day. If the weather is warm enough, you could breakfast outside on the shrub-filled terrace. An antique writing desk adds elegance to the room and the wifi worked flawlessly. The phone line is direct but there is voice mail and the line will ring through to the office is left to ring. Residents have their own keys and Ruth lays little traps of sweet jars throughout the hallway, to distract you from the flowers and the sherry she has left out.I saw no other residents during my stay but you do hear them. This is an old house, and it has all the gentle creaks and footfalls which that entails. The bathroom in the Opera Suite is on the small side and both it and the kitchen might eventually benefit from updating of fittings. But please, Ruth, keep the worn and loved elegance. I adored all the eclectic pots, plates and dishes in the kitchen cupboards and the bathroom was piled with soft towels, toiletries and robes. This is not the place to stay if you have children with you, even though there is also a sofa bed. If you leave the kids elsewhere and want a romantic, quiet, gentle time to concentrate with a loved one, eat out at leisure, take in something at Lincoln Centre and wander around on foot, this Suite is more than perfect.

Our expectations for a special place to stay were somewhat set after reading all the reviews here prior to making our recent booking. Well, our expectations were actually exceeded. We both totally agree with ALL the positive comments made in previous reviews, so it's difficult to think of anything new or unique to add. We have traveled extensively for both business and pleasure over the past 35+ years. We've had the pleasure of staying at many very fine hotel and resort properties, and even some really good BB's both in the States and abroad. But I can say that we found staying at The Inn NYC to be more like staying at a good friend's place. Sharing not just a room, but part of their home. We 've already booked the Library and Opera suites for December '08. My wife and I will be taking our son, daughter, spouses and 2 grandsons for 4 nights after Christmas through New years Day. We're convinced that it's the perfect choice for a special and memorable holiday-time place to stay in NYC. My wife and I have already told friends and family who travel to New York regularly about how impressed we are with Inn New York City. Unfortunatley, I think bookings may now become harder to come by. I know my wife and I plan to stay at Ruth's Inn on ALL our future trips to New York City. But since we're not aware of anyplace like the Inn new York City elsewhere, we'll have to settle for just another hotel when traveling to any other city. Thanks, Ruth for your hospitality.

The reviews were all on target. The accomodations worked well for our family with the separate living room and downstairs bedroom. The bedroom was so quiet...the walls must be so thick because we heard none of the neighbors or street traffic. It was very nice to have the small, but well stocked kitchen available. We ended up eating breakfast at home everyday. My sons and I loved the quiche and pastries provided, which along with orange juice and milk, started our day off well. There were lots of goodies provided...we especially enjoyed the chocolate cake and apple pie that were waiting when we returned after a long day of sightseeing. The location of the Inn is perfect. We bought 7 day passes for the subway/buses. The subway stop is closeby on 72nd, but we opted to take buses in order to see the city (which is very convenient to the Inn as well). There are loads of wonderful places to eat nearby. We enjoyed Citrus (Cuban with an Asian twist)---they had a tasty brunch on Sunday. Also, stop by Buttercup Bake Shop (on 72nd between Broadway and Columbus) if you haven't had enough sweets at the Inn. The cupcakes were delicious and the peanut butter cookies were so good! Within a short walk are shopping, an AMC theatre, Barnes  Noble, Lincoln Center...I could go on. We walked to The Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Central Park) and the Museum of Natural History. The best part about the location is the quiet. Just spend some time in Times Square or walking in crowds on Fifth Avenue and you'll appreciate the fact that you are staying at the Inn. My only suggestion...and only negative comment...was mentioned by another reviewer about the bed in the Vermont Suite. I found it a little too stiff and sometimes awoke with aches if I slept on my side. Perhaps switching to a Select Comfort AIr Mattress or similar type of mattress might be an option considering logistics of moving a mattress up/down the steep spiral staircase.

It is full of visual surprises, including a sled, a propeller, a book-filled ladder and a displaced staircase cum towel stand. (This description does not do the Inn justice--please refer to the Inn's website. A picture = 1000 words.) in the Library Suite, there are, as you might expect, books everywhere; the shelves include current best-sellers and classics; the tissue box covers are book-shaped; an instruction manual on ironing for men is hidden in the ensuite laundry area. When we arrived, a quiche, bagels, brie and a bottle of pinot grigio were just some of the items waiting for us in our kitchen. There were chocolates on our pillows. Orange juice, more bagels and fresh pastries mysteriously appeared each day. Fresh fruit was always available in the front hallway. Housekeeping was unobtrusive and meticulous. The Inn has no street-front sign, which gives guests the pleasant illusion, when entering or exiting the building, of being residents rather than tourists. We loved the Inn's location. It is on New York's Upper West Side, just two blocks from Central Park, one block from the subway and five blocks from the Lincoln Center. The Inn is surrounded by cafes, restaurants and shopping.

We used it the express trains get to the 42nd street station and Penn Station with ease. \u9225\ue53ahe subway station is at the junction of Amsterdam and Broadway which is really a thriving place \u9225?banks, shops, and fast food restaurants galore. It just seems so unreal to be in the middle of all of the hustle there and step onto 71st.\u9225?1st is absolutely gorgeous. It\u9225\u6a9a shaded by the buildings with lots of trees and little gardens and flower boxes by the residents. I didn\u9225\u6a9b realize how shaded it was until I walked over to 72nd which is much wider and sunnier.\u9225\ue53ahere\u9225\u6a9a a 24-hour Duane Read a block away on 72nd.\u9225\ue52cairway Market is 3 blocks away. With the kitchen and accessories this place has, this is a real bonus and a significant way to cut down expenses. You feel like a local between shopping at Fairway and then preparing it in your brownstone kitchen.\u9225\ue528uttercup Bake Shop is a couple of blocks away if you are craving cupcakes. The vanilla butter cream were great; the red velvet not so great.\u9225\ue53de picked up the M5 bus uptown at West End and 72nd and, man, was that an incredible drive. You have Riverside Park to the west with the Hudson and gorgeous brownstones on the east for over 30 blocks. This was one of the highlights of our trip.PROBLEMS\u9225\ue53ahe toilet paper is really thin. I know this sounds picky, but you would expect something nicer at a place like this so concerned with the details.\u9225\ue53ahe towels were so worn they were threadbare. They were huge, though, so you can tell that there was care made in the decision to use them. They just need to be replaced.\u9225\ue53fou can hear the guests walk around upstairs. There\u9225\u6a9a no creaking of the floors (that will drive me away from a place), so it wasn\u9225\u6a9b that bad.\u9225\ue53ahe shower head is pretty but not very functional. On the positive side, the hot water comes out instantly and is plentiful.\u9225\ue53ahe bed is lumpy, but I don\u9225\u6a9b see how they could replace it. You couldn\u9225\u6a9b get a mattress down the staircase without taking the staircase out. My mom suggested maybe a foam mattress cover would even out the bumps.AMENITIES\u9225\ue53aV with the full selection (through 300 something) of digital channels including HBO\u9225? distinct living areas in the Vermont Suite which can become 2 bedrooms: bedroom with queen bed and bath downstairs and living room with sofa bed and kitchen upstairs.\u9225\ue534o street noise\u9225\ue539oft feather pillows even with the sofa bed\u9225\ue53ahe owner is wonderful. She is there as much or as little as you need her. \u9225\ue52cresh flowers both upstairs and downstairs\u9225\ue536hone with a direct number, free local calls, and voicemail\u9225\ue53ahere is wood every where! The antiques in this place give it such a beautiful touch.\u9225\ue53fou really feel like you are coming home every night. We came in one night at the same time as the guy at the same level next door. \u9225\ue53ahe a/c is in a window, but it\u9225\u6a9a strong! You can move the airflow where ever you want it.\u9225\ue53ahe sheets are so soft both on the queen bed and the sofa bed.\u9225\ue53ahere are lamps and lights every where. You can tell that it\u9225\u6a9a intentionally set up for many reading spaces.\u9225\ue53ahe amount of food included every day is amazing. I tried making a list of all the different choices and stopped at 20 leaving out plenty. We made breakfast every day out of it plus the occasional lunch, part of dinner, and dessert. It cut our expenses down significantly which helped with the price of the room.\u9225\ue53de awoke daily to that day\u9225\u6a9a New York Times.\u9225\ue53ahe kitchen was smaller than I expected, but it is so well planned. We made a few meals actual meals in it boiling corn, eggs, etc. My mom is on a strict low sodium diet, so we cooked in as many meals as we could to control her sodium intake. I know NYC is famous for its restaurants, but there is something so pleasing to come home and enjoy a leisurely dinner bonding over the day\u9225\u6a9a events. This kitchen and the beautiful drop-leaf table really allow you to do that.\u9225\ue53ahe sofa bed was really comfortable \u9225?almost to the point of being like a real bed.This place is truly like having your own beautifully furnished apartment with so many extras in an incredible location. I know I\u9225\u6a93 forgetting so many things because it seemed like every where we turned there was yet another wow! reaction. I\u9225\u6a9de decided that I want to come back next year and have already started looking for another perfect place. Since I started searching so late this time, I thought I could find a better place that was booked at the time. I have not been able to find anything that can equal the combination of the amenities at the Inn, the beauty and accessibility of the UWS location, and the reasonable price.", "Date": "Sep 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465945363", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "catherp"}, {"Content": "Sophisticated, Elegant, Exceptional My wife and I just returned from a wonderfully memorable stay at this lovely Inn. The thought of an inn in bustling New York City may seem a bit incongruous, but although Inn New York offers a comfortable haven from city stress, it isn't a rustic country bed and breakfast. Inn New York City offers a graceful, elegant and sophisticated ambiance, created with great care and a generous spirit. The attention to detail, the tasteful and original decoration, and the many thoughtfull touches make one feel exceedingly comfortable. The combination of experiencing the carefree convenience of being in a hotel while at the same time feeling as though one is relaxing in one's own pied de terre, is exceptional.

Granted, better hotels have a lot of different amenities to offer but at the same time what they all offer is a sameness, so that you really can't tell if you're in NYC, Detroit, or Peoria. But you do want something different, don't you? If so, then I strongly suggest staying at the Inn New York City.As the name suggests, not only are you right in the city, you are right in a west-side neighborhood. Located just a few blocks from seveal good restaurants (we liked Fiorelli's and Luxemborg best) Central Park, Lincoln Center, the Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and an MTA station, the Inn NYC consists of a traditional multi-floor brownstone separated into several rental areas. Notice that I didn't say rooms, as each area consists of more than just a bedroom and a bath, but instead each is a unique area on its own (be sure and check out their website for lots of good photos of each). Bottom line: if you want a great location with some unique charm, this is your place.We took a 30 minute cab ride from LaGuardia to the Inn ($30 + tip) where we were greeted by the owner, Ruth, and shown to our room. We stayed in the Opera room, which is located on the ground floor, while the others are upstairs. Guests are given a set of keys to the two front doors right off 71st Street and to the door to your area, so immediately it feels like you're staying in someone's home and not in a rental property. Ruth and her daughter, Ellen, run the Inn and are both wonderful people who truly seem to want to make your stay all it can be. Have questions or need a suggestion for lunch or shopping? They're right down the hall or just call them. To get around town, the MTA station is only a block away and taxis are plentiful.So, here are your choices the next time you visit NYC: another hotel room or something different and wonderful like the Inn. Take my advice and make your trip even better by staying at the Inn New York City.

My wife and I stayed at Inn New York City for a week in late May (20th to the 27th May). When first entering the Vermont Suite, you feel like you are transported into your own little world. The duplex style suite has everything you need and is furnitured so elegantly. With this suite having it's own separate entrance it feels like you are experiencing New York from your own place in the Upper West Side.After spending the days in a variety of places around New York, it was always great to get back to the peace and tranquility of our place, before freshening up for the evening.I can not recommend this place more highly. The owners are there as much or as little as you need, the pantry is refreshed everyday and the facilities are first rate.What makes The Inn even better is that it is just a couple of blocks away from Central Park and there is a metro stop at the end of the tree lined street (so you can get around the city so easily). I would highly recommend the $24 seven day ticket (or other metrocard options) as it is an excellent way to navigate the whole area.With this being our first trip to New York, we will definitely be back.

The refrigerator was well-stocked and replenished every day. There was a delicious bottle of white wine and a Best Wishes chocolate cake upon our arrival. The service made us feel so special. The bed was so comfortable and I loved the fact that all the bed linen was changed daily, including the down comforter. Housekeeping was excellent! The Inn is located on a quiet street on the UWS very convenient to the 72nd St. subway stop. It felt very safe walking in the area late at night. One of our pleasant NY experiences was getting a Gray's Papaya hot dog one afternoon. The hot dog stand is located at 71st and Broadway, just up the street from our Inn. I love NYC!

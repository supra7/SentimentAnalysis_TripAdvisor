It is very well maintained overall, although the carpeting in our room was a bit worn in the doorways. These rooms are smaller than the newer Drury Inns, so the bathroom was very small, although adequate. The bed was OK, but not the most comfortable of our trip, and we stayed in 4 different Drury's during our travels this time. The breakfast area is quiet small, as is the business area. They still serve the ill compliment of hot evening foods, beverages, and breakfast. The serving area is small compared to some other Drury's. The staff was fabulous, as always. Helpful, friendly, courteous, in all capacities. The room was clean. A few things were found bothersome, which may be picky, but there was not a recliner chair in the room and the TV remote would not consistently work. Also, they only have an outdoor pool, which is oly open in the summer months.

A nice hotel and a good value. Since we started going there five years ago they've remodeled the lobby and breakfast area, and also refreshed the rooms. They are comfortable and quiet. It's nice to have a split bathroom, with toilet/shower in a separate room from the sink/mirror area. Some rooms are around an open area exposed to the lobby below, so I've had concern there could be a noise problem. But we've never been disturbed by it. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. I enjoy chatting with the gal who runs the breakfast buffet. She keeps the items fresh and is there to help if there's a problem. A nice variety of hot items (eggs, sausage, french toast, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal) and two do-it-yourself wafflemakers (improved newer ones when we last visited). Also a variety of fruits, breads, donuts, and cereals. There is also an evening snack and drinks until 7PM, and popcorn (my favorite) until 10PM.

A number of things made the hotel unattractive. Check in was literally 15 seconds and check out was unnecessary. Front desk and the breakfast crew do a great job with service. Customer service is very good and clearly a high priority. Unfortunately, the hotel is lacking. The king bed room was just a bit small. For example, the distance from the tub to the counter in the bathroon is the width of the door. The TV is just a bit large for the room. The desk is more of a writing desk than a work area and is about half the depth that is comfortable. The bed was uncomfortable. Too firm with little cushion. Flushing the toilet created a very loud whine while filling (a minute at least). There was a low hum that kept me awake until about 1am. I assume it was either the HVAC or a truck idling in the parking lot. I was on the road side and was up about 5:30am because of the traffic noise. I was down stairs at about 8:15am for breakfast. My electronics were not with me and I was hoping to use the hotel computer. Unfortunately, someone was camped on the 1 computer I saw. Breakfast was terrible. I assume it was because of the time of day. Biscuits and gravy: hard biscuit and off tasting gravy. I settled for organic granola, a mini Yoplait yogurt, and coffee. The granola was very good and the coffee tasted burned and very acidic. Perhaps a 1 off, but I will not stay at this location again. There is a Drury Inn & Suites across town.

We chose the hotel because of its relative convenience to the Indiana State Fairgrounds, where the convention was being held, and because it provided both a full breakfast and a light supper. The hotel is comfortable -- good beds, nice service. The rooms are standard, the beds comfortable. There are not a lot of extras in the rooms, but there is free internet, plus a refrigerator. I believe the real reason people stay here is for the food. The full breakfast is quite good - scrambled eggs, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, yogurt, doughnuts, etc. It doesn't seem to vary much, which is fine. In the evening, from 5:30 - 7:00, there is provided what they call a \"Kick Back.\" This was easily a meal for my daughter and me, plus most of the other people at the hotel. There were always good baked potatoes, lettuce, carrots and celery, chips, and hot dogs. In addition, there was always something else: hamburger mix and refried beans for nachos or to go on the baked potatoes, chicken nuggets, or spicy chicken, macaroni & chees, chili, and/or cream of broccoli soup. If we could arrange our schedule to be at the hotel during \"Kick Back,\" we didn't have to go out to eat. As for the position of the hotel, it is right next to a busy freeway. The freeway noise could be disturbing to a light sleeper. If that is the case, request a room on the side of the hotel away from the freeway. Our room was on the noisy side, but it didn't bother us. If my schedule were to allow me to always be at the hotel at dinner time, I would choose the Drury Inn over other similar hotel chains.,.

Thus the extra care in choosing SWA, probably the last airline to consider passenger care a priority, and the Drury Inn, both for location and my experience with them. I just can't thank the Indy Drury Inn enough for their graciousness. Everything I knew of them as a chain, plus the extra of great staff training. Family members were all arriving at different times, but the desk was aware of the group. Everyone working there treated my mother like royalty without fawning over her handicap. In fact, the family voted to cancel the next night's lodging in a different city and drive back to this Drury instead.

When the hostess finally went to refill the food, she was licking her fingers. I didn't go back for refills. Also - not the hotel's fault - kids were running around like crazy in the eating area, sticking their hands in some kind of \"pond\" - with some of them barefoot. UGH!

My husband and I really enjoyed staying at this Drury Inn in Indianapolis. We have never stayed at any Drury Inn before, and after this experience we wonder why we did not try here before Holiday Inn, Ramada, Court Yard, Best Western etc. We stayed here for 4 night in March. The building may be a little bit old, but the room is very clean! Our non-smoking room was quiet (this is very important to us!). The bed was big enough. The staff was friendly. It is located within the walking distance from Cracker Barrel, Bob Evans and other restaurants. Good hot breakfast - waffel, scramble egg, sausage, gravy with biscuit (it was the same during our entire stay). Unlike some other hotels, this one has a large breakfast room. What we liked so much about Drury Inn were free snacks and drinks from 5PM-7PM, free popcorn and soft drinks in the room, and free one hour long distance call! If we ever return to Indianapolis, we will go back there for SURE!", "Date": "April 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valparaiso Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAutomobile break-ins\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4356863", "Content": "I was told to be park in the reary parking lot to be near my room.

When the police came to make a report I informed that it just happened to another person the evening prior to the day I checked in. The hotel was totally aware of it and did not warn me about parking in the rear. I feel that sending a woman alone to the back parking lot could of been alot more serious than just my car being burglarized. If this doesn't get posted I will post it on another website. People should be warned of such risks!

In addition to the amenities listed by the previous reviewer, it is next door to a \"family\" restaurant and only a short stroll to several others. High speed internet worked flawlessly. I was quite pleased with the comfort of the place for families with young children. The only \"hitch\" was that we were put in a room across the elevator, which did not seem like a big deal until early in the morning, when I was rousted by a buzzing sound that kept repeating every 10 minutes or so. After clearing my head I realized that it was the elevator (which I hadn't noticed earlier). It was annoying, but since we were there only for a night, I chalked it up to a lesson learned (never stay in a room next to or across an elevator). Several days later, I received a customer satisfaction survey via email. I noted the elevator incident (not as a complaint, just as information) but noted that I was a happy customer. Within a day I recieved an email from the manager saying she had credited me for the cost of the stay, saying that \"a good night's sleep\" should be part of their service. Wow!

You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent 45 minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel. Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater. We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it. We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $199 each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc. Make sure you book the 9/11 Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers. The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-( Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though. We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like. We were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.

You can see the Emipre State building from the room and you are graced by a number of diners on the main street. Breakfast let the hotel down a little, $22 for cold meats and cheese but go across the road to Moonstruck and have the best 'Irish' breakfast for a lot less money. Draw back is the wi-fi but to be fair America is already on 4G and its our phone roaming costs that are idiotic bearing in mind the technology available.

We had won a contest, so thank goodness we didn't have to pay for our stay or I would have been even more disappointed with the service. However, the room was nicely furnished and the bathroom was luxurious (we had a Deluxe Room). Our toilet ran incessantly and the engineer that came to fix it was annoyed more and more each time he came to help us. Internet access was a bit of a hassle, was on the phone with tech support for +30 minutes as their service didn't support my device (HP Touch Pad) and had to initially try to get access on my cell phone which lead me to being charged for roaming. Housekeeping was a little pushy but our rooms were kept with the maximum amount of care and attention. We had a package sent to the hotel a week before our arrival but it got lost somewhere along the way, the staff did very little to help us track it down, although one front desk clerk tried his best to show empathy.

They still have the old CRT TVs which baffles me since you can get new 32\" LCD TVs for $200-$300. There was no view from the window, just a view of the other rooms and brick walls of the hotel...but might you this hotel if very very old.

There was what used to be a restaurant at the base of the hotel which has gone out of business, so I'm not sure why they don't make this area into a fitness facility. The location of the hotel is excellent but watch out for the hotel parking fees. They charge $37 per 24 hour period for a car and $10 more for an SUV. If you have the car parked for 25 hours you will get dinged for two full days no exceptions so be careful.

My prior stay at the Jolly was in 2008. Overall, for a clean, basic room on a budget, this is a great mid-town choice. First, the hotel is supurbly located on the corner of 38th and Madison. You can walk most anywhere in mid-town from this location and you are just a few blocks away from Grand Central Station. As we arrived, the hotel for the most part appeared to be the same as my 2008 visit. The lobby is pleasant but nothing fancy and our check-in was with no problem. There is a bar in the lobby (The Whaler) but did not try it. Our room (we had the standard room) on the 11th floor was small, basic, but had everything we needed. The bathroom was well appointed with a nice pedastal sink, and a shower with plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The room is small but no different than 10 other hotels in NYC that I have stayed in. The bed was comfortable with the only real minus being an awful motel quality bed spread we had to peel off each day. The furniture in the room was dated but everything worked great was very clean. Somewhat notably the room got VERY warm each day (we could not figure out given the cold temps outside) and kept the individual climate control unit by the window on COOL HI, to keep the room at a reasonable temperature. Our room was very quiet and despite the hotel being sold out I did not hear a single peep from an adjoining room in three days. Wireless internet service was $9.99 a day and worked great for us. For food, we very much enjoyed the diner across the street, Moonstruck, for our breakfast needs. The maid service did a great job and we left the appropriate tip for them, acknowledging their great work. As my last stay, my sense is this hotel is closely linked with travel agencies in Europe that book a lot of Italian and tourists from other parts of Europe. Overall, I like Jolly Hotel Madison Towers and would stay here again. If you are a fussy, high-maintenance traveller, used to having the red carpet rolled out for you upon arrival and need extensive concierage support during your stay - this may not be the choice for you.

Lobby is very nice, but our first room was on a floor that looked extremely worn (black marks on the walls, old carpet, etc.) Our room was decent size with two double beds, but again the room looked worn and old (seemed like 1990s furnishings) with an old tube TV. Bathroom was on the small side but still manageable. Windows looked out on to the brick wall of the next building. Unfortunately, on day two of our stay, we came back to discover one large cockroach in the bathtub. We did not like this and went down to the lobby - management was extremely nice and understanding, and they immediately upgraded us to a new room. Next room was great - hallways and rooms recently renovated. Large clean beds and huge room along with a flat screen TV. Bathroom was also spacious, but it was weird because the door was a sliding frosted glass door with no lock. Rest of the stay was uneventful, and both rooms were clean besides our one mishap.

I would have preferred a mattress topper as the mattress was quite hard. The bed linen was thin, and with holes. No sign of any bed bugs though! The heating/cooling system wasn't very efficient and was quite noisy. My room was very very hot and the air con was blowing out warm air despite being set to 16 degrees. The maintenance chap quickly came up and sorted it by adjusting the bathroom radiator. The water from the sink ran brown initially which was off putting, but aparently down to the room having not been used for a few days. I would advise letting the taps run for a while before you think about making a drink or cleaning your teeth! Location wise it was great, I didn't eat breakfast there but my friends did the first morning. Apparently it was over priced and not great so for the remainder of our stay we ate the Moonstruck Diner opposite. The staff at the hotel were a little odd, plenty of them around but don't expect them to open the door for you! We also got the hard sell on their car service back to the airport. We politely declined and said we were happy to get a cab and were given lots of scaremongering over how difficult it would be to get a cab. As you can imagine, we had no problem at all, and a cab is cheaper than the hotel car. There was no free wifi in the room, and the wifi that I paid for was temperamental. There was also no free internet access in the reception so we had to pay to get online to do our online flight check in. Little things like this really let hotels down in my opinion.

We'd read some of the reviews of the Jolly Madison and were a bit unsure of what to expect. The entrance is quite grand with a large marble staircase facing you as you enter. But beyond this, the overall first impression was disappointing with the hotel lobby being a bit shabby - the paintwork and furnishings need a bit of freshening up and the reception area in general being not very welcoming. The room was very small and even for two people, there was not a lot of room to move about and a lack of storage facilities. Again the bedroom decor was a bit shabby but the bathroom appeared to have been given a facelift recently and was very nice. The room was clean and was well serviced daily Some of the other bedrooms appeared to be larger and it is worth asking for a street view room if that is important. There is free broadband access in the rooms is you enquire about it. In general the rooms were fairly typical of those in other NY hotels we have stayed in with the exception of the size. The biggest problem we had with the room was that we struggled to get the air conditioning to cool the room down to any great extent. New York in September is very humid and this was a problem. Depite all of that, the hotel is in a fantastic location just a few minutes walk away from Grand Central station for the subways and about 10-15 minutes from Times Square. There are plenty of bars and eating places along 38th Street and Maidison and 5th Avenues. The 38th Street diner was full of locals which is always a good sign and was very good. If you are staying in your hotel room for any length of time in New York then you are not doing the city justice and for that reason the Jolly Madison is a perfectly adequate as a base.

When staying in Central Manhattan on a not enormous budget your options are a tad limited, as most of the hotels in central manhattan are 4 or 5 star. So you have a bit of a decision to make when you visit, which is either to use your money to stay in a really nice hotel out of central Manhattan and nearer JFK airport, or stay in a budget hotel like this one in the centre. Personally as we go on holiday to explore, central location was more important to us than the hotel per se. The location of this one for exploring really is brilliant, as you are only a few minutes away from various things, not least Grand Central station which is a huge bonus if you intend to travel around Mahattan a lot, as Grand Central is connected to nearly every Subway line. The hotel itself really is okay as well. The rooms are clean (if pretty small), but if you just want a base site to go off exploring from like us and don't intend to spend too much time in the hotel, then you shouldn't have any real issues. We only really used the staff to check-in / check-out but they were friendly and courteous when we did. As with many hotels though, they make their money back on extras like Wi-fi, phone calls, etc, so just be wary if you use these things. As for breakfast, it's not included in the cost of your room, and frankly the hotel charges silly prices for it if you want it for an extra. I recomend doing what we did and visit the diner across the road from the hotel instead, which has plenty of good value breakfast options.

Bathroom was similarly small, with a puzzling sheet of glass across half of the tub in lieu of a shower curtain. It worked exactly as you'd expect. Lone ice machine located on the fourth floor. Not much of an inconvenience, really. We got a good laugh perusing the room service prices. We knew it was New York, but we were still able to laugh at their obviously grandiose opinion of the value of their offerings. Luckily, there is a small grocery store around the corner in the same building for food, drinks, etc. and a really nice diner with reasonable (for New York City) prices right across the street. We wouldn't be eating their overpriced room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service items or using their similarly overpriced breakfast buffet. Didn't try the bar. Can't say whether it is overpriced or not. We can, however use our imaginations. Air conditioner on one of the coolest Mays in record could barely keep the room comfortable. We felt sticky and uncomfortable most of the time that we were in the room. Fortunately, the instinct to flee the room at every opportunity kept us out of it for a good part of our stay. The hotel description mentions \"city or courtyard views.\" Well we knew we didn't have a city view but \"courtyard?\" \"Courtyard\" must be Italian for \"three dark walls and a rank of industrial air conditioners.\" A darker, more depressing scene would be hard to imagine. The complimentary shampoo and shower gel was colorful and effective. (The fruitiness of the flavors made me feel just like a lollipop after showering!) The bottles that I managed to cram into my suitcase are going to make great stocking-stuffers for Xmas, I'm sure.

The desk clerk said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But you used your car.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Admittedly, I had for one day, in order to move my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s things from her apartment to a storage facility. He explained that every time you use your car, you incur a NEW 24 hours of parking charges. (Indeed, buried in their web site is the language, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no in/out privileges. If you take your car out, the 24 hours starts over when you return.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) I accepted that policy, yet he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain how the fourth parking charge was added to the bill. The more I inquired, the heavier his accent got until we simply couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t communicate. I paid the entire bill with my credit card and left, vowing never to return.

I rarely write reviews for hotels. In fact I have only written one other hotel review on trip advisor and it was a positive review, so this is significant. The hotel is dishonest. When we arrived we expected a four star hotel. It is not. They told us when we checked in that parking was $37 a day. They didn't say anything else about the parking. They also told us that they didn't have any adjacent rooms except for those right next to the street that were very noisy. Otherwise the rooms would be far apart. Since we had children we had to have them close together. After complaining about the noisy room they reluctantly admitted that they really did have two adjacent rooms on the 4th floor and they gave them to us. The rooms were OK nothing nice. But I was shocked when I went to my children's room in the morning to find the door wasn't locked all night. It was shut but it didn't auto lock! We found that we had to slam it shut hard to get it to lock. At the end of the 2 days we checked out on time, paid our bill with the 2 days parking and went outside to get the car from the valet. They told us that we had to walk down to the parking garage to get our car. We waited for at least 10 minutes and then they brought it to us. We had parked a Mazda 5 which is classified as a midsize wagon. We commented on a sign in the parking garage that listed 1 hr of parking $15 and discussed how ridiculous that price was for 1 hr. We went home. Later we received our credit card statement. There was an extra charge of $47 from this hotel. When I enquired about it they said that we had stayed 20 minutes over the allotted time in the parking garage and was therefore charged for a whole extra day of parking. I asked where it stated that and he told me that there is no information about this in the hotel room - the only clue is that on the valet ticket you get it says in small print at the bottom $37 for 24 hrs. parking plus $10 for SUVs. When I said we didn't park an SUV he said that the parking garage decided that it was an SUV. I asked why they didn't tell us about this at the time, why they didn't give us a receipt and an explanation at the time we picked up the car and he said there was no way they could do that after we had already checked out of the hotel. This does not make any sense to me- there was a cash register inside the parking garage. I believe that the whole business is underhanded and deceitful and I would never recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWarm welcome everytime\u201d", "Author": "MMSenator", "ReviewID": "UR115519086", "Content": "I usually spend several weeks in NY for business during the year and I always confirm my stay at Jolly Madison .

After all, it was NYC and if you're not spending upwards of $250 - $300 a night for a room, you never can be sure of what you're going to get (small, dirty and bedbugs are all things that come to mind!). Plus, some of the reviews I'd read here about this place were less than flattering. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and had a very enjoyable stay and experience here. The location is PERFECT. You're within a very short walking distance of the heart of midtown and the Times Sq/Theater District and all the attractions therein. The hotel itself, while not \"fancy\" was quite nice and well above average. I didn't eat there although they do offer a buffet breakfast. But there's lots of great (and no doubt cheaper) eating places close by. My room was on the 6th floor on the Madison Ave side. It was moderate sized and spacious; plenty big for one, and big enough for two. I had a very comfy kingsized bed. The furnishings were in great shape, the room was very clean and everything worked. There was a big desk and wireless internet access. The room was also quiet with virtually no street noise reaching the 6th floor (Madison Ave is not a huge or extremely busy street), and not a sound from the surrounding rooms. The bathroom was very nice--spacious, super clean with updated/modern appointments and lots of tile and stone surfaces along with a window facing Madison Ave too. The staff was efficient, helpful and friendly, although in all honesty I was a very low maintenance guest and so I had little interaction with them. I did have a car though and the hotel does offer valet parking. The $48/night charge (this included a $10 surcharge because I had an SUV) did raise my eyebrows. I did check with a couple-three public garages within a block or two of the hotel, and their rate for 24hrs was exactly the same as the hotel (including the $10 SUV surcharge), so I knew I wasn't being (additionally) ripped off. The only catch is that there's no in and out privileges, so each time you go out and come back, it's $48. Fortunately I needed my car only once in 2 days, so I didn't pay anything extra. But this was a really good hotel and an exceptionally good value for a prime (and safe) location in midtown Manhattan.

We had a standard room on the 7th floor which overlooked the entrance. It's a very dated room, with green patterned carpets and floral bedspreads, CRT television sets and a rickety air conditioning system. We both found it awkward that there was a fully transparent window in the shower looking onto the street, with no blind to pull down. A very strange design I would say. Breakfast was plentiful the next morning, although it became apparent that this hotel was very popular with Italians and all the staff seemed to favour and chat to the Italians much more than Brits like us and an Australian couple who we were sat in the corner with.

Not sure if this was actually arranged by the hotel or not, as the porter and driver seemed very friendly and of the same nationaility. He also took us on a hair raising detour from the highway of what I presume was Brooklyn, and got us to the airport 3 hour ahead of our flight, which was great, but I'm still not sure if this was an official taxi or not, and I would definitely book one at the front desk or grab one on the street like normal.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast, northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cWater doesn't go to corner rooms\u201d", "Author": "scoobyscout", "ReviewID": "UR98378340", "Content": "AVOID this hotel at all costs.

The woman that checked me in was discourteous and argumentative. I originally asked for a room away from the elevators. When we got up to our room, it ended up being directly behind the elevators. So, I went back down to the desk to ask for another room. The woman insisted that the original room wasn't \"next to\" the elevators (meaning to the right or to the left of it). I was trying to politely explain that it was still near the elevator, but she continued to argue that it wasn't \"next to\" the elevators. Honestly, I felt like I was back in elementary school bickering with a stubborn little girl who always got her way! It was ridiculous! What ever happened to the idea that \"the customer is always right?\" We did end up getting another room, which I was thankful for and glad the woman at the desk was able to accommodate me in that way. On the positive note (and pretty much the only one I really have for this hotel), the hotel is in a GREAT location!

Now we were expecting a small room having stayed at tourist hotels in New York before so it didn't alarm us but when we asked about the free Wi-Fi we were told there was no free service and that it was 10 dollars a day (when we booked it said free Wi-Fi) he decided to throw it in though because in his words we had got a \"sucky room\". We got our room keys and headed up to our room on the 11th floor, at no point did anyone offer to take our bags no big deal as we only had carry on but I have never not been asked at a hotel before. We got to the room and to be honest it was far better than we were expecting you could walk easily all the way around the bed (we had a smaller room at the New Yorker) and the bathroom looked like it had been redone recently and all the fittings were nice. Basic is they only way to describe the room. There is a mini bar but it is locked and I believe you had to ask for the key. This meant no fridge and as a British tourist there are no tea/coffee making facilities which I found unusual. The toiletries were ample plus iron, ironing board, hairdryer and I am happy to report there were no bed bugs (we checked as soon as we got into the room) The main problem was the construction which happens at night right outside the window which makes it difficult to sleep even with earplugs. Housekeeping was good also the room always looked clean and tidy when we returned at the end of they day. We had breakfast in the room at $58 for 2 ($22 per peron plus tax and service) which was nice enough but not quite value for money although it came on time. Coffee, orange juice and some pastries is what you got anything else was extra it would have been nice if they had included some yoghurt or fruit. Checking out was easy also except when they tried to charge us for a bottle of water from the locked mini bar and we were told that left luggage costs a tip to the guy that tags your bag which is fine but I would rather they just charge as I am never sure how much to tip someone for putting a sticker on your bag and putting on a shelf.

They took my credit card and did a pre-authorization of $25/night in case I incurred any charges. The check-in was efficient and we arrived a bit early but we were able to check-in no problem. Elevators were small but were pretty quick and were not a problem during our trip. We were placed on the 7th floor in a room directly behind the elevator. The green carpet was cheesy but after the reviews I was expecting astroturf. I didn't really care. We were expecting a small room so it wasn't a big deal when we saw it. We got a queen bed which was okay for us. The main room had some dirty mud spots on the carpet. The bed was indeed a bit saggy but we never seemed to mind too much. Make sure you tuck the mattress cover underneath the bed because if you move around in your sleep you may expose the dirty mattress. The television was really bad, it had really bad ingress on the lower channels and the remote never controlled the tv volume or power on/off. Again we only watched tv early morning or late at night, so not a big deal. The air conditioner did a good job of cooling the room however it occassionally had a grinding or electrical noise coming out of it randomly. You do need to watch the shower as water can indeed go everywhere. On the flip side, there was good pressure out of the showerhead. We had a room away from madison avenue facing a brick wall so outside noise was not a problem..we definitely preferred this. There were NO BED BUGS. We were a bit nervous going to sleep our first night to see if we would wake up with bites. The room service was good, the maid replaced the towels that we threw in the tub. There was no free wi-fi which sucked, they have a computer in the front lobby at a rate of $3.95 for 15 minutes. We had to use this to pick our seats for our flight. The location was definitely the hotel's best feature. 5 minutes to grand central, empire state and about 15 minutes to times square. The moonstruck cafe on the corner has a really good for breakfast. We didn't even go into the hotel's restaurant. We were satisfied with the hotel as it was clean and quiet. Overall the hotel is probably a 2* but the location was an important feature for us .

The lady I spoke to on the phone was friendly, and promised us a standard king room on the 14th floor. However, we were told at check-in that no standard rooms were available except on the 9th floor. Right away, I knew that they were trying to put us in the infamous \"priceline room\". To avoid this, one tip to priceline travelers: ask for a room AWAY from the elevators. This is what we did, and our request was honored. We ended up with a king bed room one room away from the elevators. The room itself was small and tired, and bedding looked worn. TV was antiquated, and the furniture must have been there for more than 30 years. However, the bathroom was recently renovated, and, albeit small, somewhat befitting of a 2.5*-3* hotel. Of course, I expected all of this based on the tripadvisor reviews, so that may have eased my disappointment. I accidentally injured my toe and had some bleeding from under the nail. My wife went down to ask for some bandages, but apparently there was no first aid kit at the front desk. You would think that's a basic requirement for a 3* hotel. We were able to sleep ok, once we got used to the noisy AC. We tipped the maid everyday, but still had to ask for new towels on one occasion when she just re-hung the used towels.

The rest of the rooms -- most of those in the hotel -- are like ours was. Scroll down to \"Standard\" rooms and you'll see a photo of the type of room we stayed in. Ignore the peppy flowers in the foreground and you'll see a perfectly okay, low-design room. The east side location is reasonably convenient. For me personally, as a tourist visitor, the west side, with its numerous subway lines and attractions, is preferred. But the Jolly Madison's proximity to Grand Central Station is terrific, and we visited the lovely Morgan Library for the first time because it's just a block down Madison Avenue.

When I put a bid in for a NYC hotel for $100, I know that I'm not going to be staying at a luxury hotel. I get what I pay for. So after having my bid accepted for a $100 a night for two nights, I didn't want to have unrealistic expectations. Upon checking in, I asked to see the room or have a choice of rooms. The attendant seemed puzzled by this so I ask her if there were any upgrades available. I was moved from a standard room to a deluxe room for $50.00 a night. Though I never saw a standard room, the deluxe room was a pleasant surprise. My room (1755) was on the 17th floor and a corner room with three windows ... including one in the bathroom. My room faced E. 28th and Madison and I loved the view. The room also had some character, including a large bathroom with tub/shower and a little \"nook\" in the room that that had two carpeted stairs leading to it. I enjoyed my morning coffee there while I decided my daily plan. Though the room did have some signs of wear (marks from luggage, etc.) it was a delight and I fell in love with it. There were only a few rooms (six I think) on the 17th floor. This was the top floor and I would recommend staying higher if possible. There is a water main being repaired from 8:00 PM until 4:30 AM each day, though the air conditioning system blocked that out and I wasn't interupted. I was interupted by the housekeeping staff that talked loudly and we opening and shutting doors, but it was after 8:00 AM. In conclusion, I would definitely stay here again. There appears to be two hotels in one, which travelers should be aware of. The bottom floors are standard rooms and the top floors are deluxe rooms. You will notice this when the elevator opens as the carpeting color is different. Four elevators are available and rarely had to wait. There is a bar, which has a nice happy hour from 5-7 with 1/2 priced cocktails. Loved that! The service at the hotel wasn't poor. They weren't overly friendly, but weren't rude either. I've been treated like royalty at other hotels, but this hotel keeps things low keyed. This didn't bother me, but others might want the red carpet rolled out when they arrive followed by a glass of wine ... that just won't be the case here. I was disappointed in the doorman though. I never say him helping anyone with luggage or opening and closing the door. Wasn't really sure of his purpose. Subway is about a ten minute walk. Grand Central in about 5 blocks north where you can catch the S, 4, 5, and 6. The 33rd station is located about 5 blocks south where you can catch the 6 train. If you prefer a close subway line, you may want to look elsewhere. I hope this review has helped you. It's honest and from my heart.

For an impromptu trip to NYC for four nights, we knew we would have some difficulty in finding a great hotel for a great price in the middle of summer/tourist season in the Big Apple. After scouring for the best deal on several discount websites (I have used almost all in the past in some form or another), we ended up getting a really good deal on Travelocity's new blind bidding service. We ended up getting the Jolly Hotel. The reviews that I read prior to going were fair and here's what I can add to them: The Up Side: 1. The location is amazing. You are a five minute walk from Grand Central, a fifteen minute walk from Times Square and have Bryant Park, Herald Square and many midtown attractions very close by. 2. The room was clean, the linens fresh and the turn down service spot on. 3. Air conditioning was a little noisy but it ended up becoming white noise to my husband and I. With all the noise you get in NYC and the regular noise you get while staying in most properties, I do not see how the AC noise could be chalked up as a problem. 4. The staff were courteous and helpful with directions and a late limo to the airport! 5. The bathroom was just as nice as any other bathroom we have had in similar properties. The shower had great pressure. The floor and tiling were clean, new and trendy. 6. The room was not cramped. We had plenty of space for luggage, walking around and relaxing in the room. 7. We got what we paid for. If you are looking for 3.5 star hotel in Manhattan, I would not say this is it. However, I would say that this property is a 3 star and was worth the price we paid for it. At the end of the day, my husband and I knew that NYC is a city to be explored so unless you are there for business, you are probably not spending much time in your room! The Down Side: 1. The hallway was dated with green turf carpeting. This did not really bug me but it may be of concern to others. 2. Our TV's \"box office\" was out of service. Nevertheless, house staff offered to fix it for us. 3. Our bed was a little on the soft side and caved in. We advised the front desk of this and they took down our complaint. 4. No free WiFi. However, McDonald's, Pret a Manger and Starbucks are a two minute walk from the property and all have free WiFi. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We did not go for the upgrade even though we thought we would need it after reading the reviews.

Also there wasn't a fridge but something the concierge said would keep things cool but not cold. And no safe in the room so you had to use a safety deposit box in the lobby and would be charged 100 US if you lost the key! To say we were disappointed was an understatement. The Whaler Bar is also a HUGE disappointment with threadbare chairs and carpeting and no one present. However our experience changed when we upgraded our room through the helpful concierge Denise. It meant paying an additional $100.00 US a night but we couldn't get over the difference. Our room was huge with a modern bathroom with a tub and shower stall, our double beds were incredibly comfortable and there was recess lighting, a functioning fridge and TV and huge console. Closet space was also not a problem and we were provided with a huge array of products in the bathroom as well as fluffy robes and slippers. Also a safe inside our room.

I thought my very bad experience was a sporadic bad incident but now, after reading other customers feedback, I understand it was not. During our journey in NYC my cousin and I were so disappointed about what we were facing at the Jolly Madison that we ended up with talking about their lake of professionalism and \"very welcoming\" staff several time while we were supposed to have few \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thoughts free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd days. While booking, I have selected the option \"two beds\", and I did it more than 1 month before travelling. While checking in I have been informed that the 2 beds room was not available; they did not apologize neither proposed a solution. I was explaining that I was on a trip with my cousin (a lady) and that what they were proposing (sharing the same bed) was really improper. They did not care till the discussion, in front of other astonished customers became finally embarrassing. Interesting that the Jolly personnel was switching from Italian to English language, depending to the customers close to the desk (Italian customers=they were switching in English language and vice versa!). In the end the solution was a small foldable bed (think about it), which was for them a permanent solution. With this bed open, the floor of the very small room was 100% occupied and moving inside was Impossible. Also the Air conditioning system was 100% faulty. Internet (I had to pay for it, while several hotels offer it as complementary) had such a bad coverage that I could not use it. Breakfast costs A LOT (the basic, not a la carte) and you are provided with croissants/jam/milk/tea. On the last day, while checking out, a helpdesk employee suggested us to talk with their manager to let her know about our story. This made the bad become worse! A lady on her mid 30s early 40s approached the desk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 another supposedly Italian lady. She was very unfriendly and arrogant, and was pointing to not existing clauses on the contract (I am not kidding; she was pointing some lines of the contract and reading something else!!!). She was explaining it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stated in the contract that the assigned rooms could be different, depending availability (not written in the contract I printed before starting my trip, but she was saying it was written over there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 crazy or arrogant?!). No apologies at all, not friendly and a believer of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The customer is always wrong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Of course she made paid my bill in full, included the late checkout which cost us 100 USD! To conclude, I leaved in NYC for 4 years, after then I am regularly visiting some friends, and I have tried several Hotels, but I never witnessed anything like the Jolly Madison. If you are Italian and you are scared to try out your basic English, and for this reason you book at the Jolly Madison Hotel, be aware that you will be speaking Italian with the Hotel staff, but this does not come \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I am still in shock even though it has been two weeks since my stay. I used Priceline and chose a 3 star hotel for this area. What a mistake! I got this hotel and quickly read the reviews. I then called Priceline and said that based on what I was reading; this hotel did not seem like a 3 star. I was informed that I was not able to change my reservation, then assured that the rating was correct. While I was not completely convinced, I decided the damage was done and that I would just have to try to be positive. My first impression was a decent lobby. It looked warn but clean. I was feeling better at this point. The hotel gave me an early check-in and told me I was in a room with two double beds; which I felt was a good start. I got to my floor and could not find the room. After asking a maid, I realized the small door right next to the elevator was my room. I was really disappointed when I walked into this little, dreary space with two single beds. I hoped there had been some sort of mistake because the lady at the front desk mentioned two double beds. When I called downstairs, she informed me that she meant single beds. Oops. There was some sort of white stain in the center of the carpet and in some parts, the dirty cream colored wallpaper looked like it had been scraped off the wall by some sort of animal. I have a hard time believing this is a 3 star room. Maybe there are nicer rooms in this hotel but I did not have it. Surprisingly, my bathroom was decent. Though not very big, everything looked nice. At the time, I wished I could have moved my little mattress in there to feel better about everything. I did not feel like complaining so, I convinced myself that it was only for a short period of time. Plus, the internet seemed to work well and that was what was most important for me to work. I woke the next day to itchy skin. No close examination was necessary to see I had been heavily bitten by something during the night. I had little bites all over my right arm and upper right leg. I was so upset, I called downstairs and told them to move me ASAP! The man at the front desk told me to bring my stuff out of the room and check it downstairs and then return to the hotel at 3pm for my new room. I said this will not work since I am working in my room and that is why I rented a hotel for 3 nights so that I would not have to move. He said nothing as I walked back upstairs to pack. I worked at my computer, staying far from my bed until 3pm and then called the front desk to get ready for my room change. The man said that it was too late, there were no more rooms left. He said it was my fault because I had to get out of my room and then come back at 3pm. Since I did not do that, I lost the chance to move. Well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what can I say? I was a little more than mad. I threatened to go to the lobby and show everyone my arm and leg. He said that I should stay where I am and that he is sending someone up. A nice woman appears and asks to look at my arm and leg. She then tells me that this hotel takes bug bites very seriously and calls the front desk. I hear her tell the man downstairs that he is to move me right away. She apologizes for the inconvenience. They moved me to another room, the same style a few floors down. I slept there one more night before I realized that saving money was not worth the personal anguish. Even though I still had one night left at this hotel, I rented a 3 \u00c2\u00bd star, upscale hotel a block away for the same price.

A 5-minute walk south of the hotel brings you to the Empire State Building, and a 5-minute walk north of the hotel brings you to Grand Central, Bryant Park, Times Square, etc. The breakfast at Moonstruck across the street was great, and cheap ($15 for 2). We arrived on July 4th, so parking on the street was free until 8am the next day. Valet parking is $37, but there are numerous parking lots around that are much (at least $10) cheaper, if you don't mind walking a little bit. The hotel lobby and restaurant were absolutely beautiful. The lounge area was comfortable and cozy, even if a little expensive. I wouldn't exactly call the hotel employees kind, friendly or helpful, but they weren't downright rude. They just acted as though they were busy, even though there wasn't anyone around. The bellman watched us struggle through the front door with several bags in the pouring rain, and then asked us if we needed him to push the elevator button. Our room was on the 8th floor. If you book your room on Priceline, you can expect to stay here. Check out my photos of the view outside the window - you will see it's NOT the Empire State Building. It's a smoking floor, and we had a smoking room even though we don't smoke. Only the hallway was smelly - our room did not smell like cigarette smoke at all. We had a king-sized bed, and it took up the entire room. Literally, to get from one side of the room to the bathroom, you have to climb over the bed. There was a nice desk with stationary, NYC info, and a spot to plug in the laptop. The tiny TV had poor reception. The room was just not \"feng shui\" at all, and if they took out the desk and rearranged things, the same tiny room would have felt a lot larger. The bathroom was cute, with a half-glass wall instead of a curtain, nice showerhead, good pressure, and plenty of toiletries. The only problem with this is that the shower didn't drain AT ALL, so by the time two of us were done, there was about 2' of dirty water in the tub. Yuck.

The maid changed the linen and towels every day. The bathroom was lovely, with plenty of very nice complimentary toiletries and masses of hot water day and night. Air conditioning was very good and gosh we needed it at 38 degrees ! The hotel receptionists couldn't have been more helpful. They booked taxis, cars, and tour buses for us and we used the free safety deposit boxes. Nothing was too much trouble. They even checked us in on line for our flight home.The doormen were stars, rushing out and getting us taxis , giving us directions and looking after our luggage for us. Thank you Eddy and Manny As two women travelling on our own , we felt very safe and secure at the Madison Towers, we were in easy walking distance of the Statue of Liberty, Macy's , 5th Ave, Broadway , Times Square, Bryant Park and Grand Central Station. We even walked to Central Park, and back about 2 miles town. Do book yourself a two or three day pass on Gray Line Bus. We did a two day for $86 each and travelled all over uptown, downtown, Central Park, Harlem etc etc as well the Night Tour and visiting the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Go online to book your Theatre tickets to get a discount., we saved 50$ each on Phantom of the Opera. Visit Gordon Ramseys at the London Hotel on 54th Street for lunch $45 a person but get dressed up as its smart dress code. The food is sublime. For breakfast go across Madison Ave to the corner with 38th street to Moonstruck were you can eat full English for $7 including coffee and juice. Amazing value, great food and open 7 days a week. Hotel is probably the best value in New York for location. Just a word though , don't forget to get lots of $1 bills as everyone in New York expects a tip. It makes up the salaries of waiters and hotel staff, but even some shop staff expect you to leave your small change. Can't think of anything else to say except GO !!!

My colleagues and I really liked our stay here. We all had Deluxe Rooms on the 15th and 16th floors. They look like they are newly remodeled. My room was right next to the elevator, so i was dreading my stay, but the elevator doesn't actually make that \"ding!\" sound when someone calls for it or when it arrives, so it turned out to be a non-issue. I had a king sized bed and 4 king sized pillows. The room is a very good size, particularly for NY. I looked forward to going back and relaxing at the end of each work day. There is sufficient desk space to work, but I tend to work sitting on my bed and the lighting was more than adequate. They offer wireless internet for a fee (kind of pricey in my opinion) which is reliable. My main complaint is with the toiletries. Although they give you lots of stuff, they do not give conditioner and most of the shampoo/shower gels smell a bit masculine. I had the same issue with my hotel in Milan, and as I believe this is an Italian chain, it must be their norm. As for the hotel overall, it is in a good location. It's easy to catch a cab or walk to many places. Lots of good places to eat and drink nearby. Also a Duane Reade nearby if you need snacks/meds/conditioner. Starbucks is only a few blocks down, but you can get a capuccino at their daily breakfast. Just be prepared to stand in line, as they check everyone off their list as they seat them. One last note...

The hotel is extremely well located right on the corner of 38th and Madison. You can walk to the theatre district in 10 minutes or so. There is not an immediate subway stop but have stops you can access within 3-4 blocks at Grand Central and Bryant Park. While the hotel has some age on it, the carpeting and lobby furnishings indicate some updating will be in order in a few years, I found the entrance pleasant, clean, safe, and professional. The lobby features a computer you can use for $4.95 per half hour if you need to check e-mail or you can pay a fee for wireless in your room.

I suspect if you are the lower floors this may be something to keep in mind in requesting a higher floor or a room on the interior. The room was well appointed albeit the furnishings were a bit dated but again the room was clean and large by Manhattan standards. The room also had a spacious closet and a small little dresser inside the closet. It is also worth noting this hotel has four working elevators that are extremely efficient. I never waited more than 20-30 seconds for an elevator, no small feat in a Manhattan hotel. As an interesting side note, this hotel is owned by an Italian hospitality company that draws a heavy Italian and European clientele. You will see signs, newspapers, tv channels, etc. all in English and Italian. I also highly recommend the diner across the street called the Moonstruck. Not fancy but excellent food.

The room looked out onto the interior courtyard and contained two single beds, a desk, desk chair, TV on a stand, a night stand, and another arm chair. The closet contained a chest of drawers that did not fit in the main space. The bathroom was small, but clean and it had been updated.

Day #1 the TV remote didn't work very well, and our window was broken (despite being closed, the upper pane kept slipping open). At approximately 1 am we finally got frustrated with the window and called the front desk. A Security Officer showed up after two calls to the front desk. The gentleman was very nice, but he was unable to fix the window. We ended up having to change rooms at 1:30 am to room #951. It was a litlle frustrating, but the new room's windows were fine. The evening's activities ended with the intermittent noise of toilets flushing and water running which we could hear very loudly through the walls. Day #2 The shower had a partial glass pane that the extended only 2 feet from the wall and allowed the water to spray all over the floor. The only way to prevent a flood was to shower in the corner all hunched over. After that the hairdryer made alot of noise, but it didn't give off any heat to speak of. Day #3 and #4 we got used to the loud sounds of toilets and water and all in all the beds were confortable enough. The staff members were nice and the hotel felt safe.

Well it was like night and day between the two rooms and I think I really appreciated the deluxe room more after staying in the standard one. The room was great and the service was better not sure if it was just the staff that was on at night or what not. Again my room was right by the elevator but I admit I didn't hear it at all but I was on the 17th floor. I found the staff helpful and the doormen great. Be careful about getting back to the hotel.

Even on the 15th floor, you can hear some car horns honking, but not too loud. This is New York City. It's par for the course. Jolly is an Italian chain, and you can see that in the room decor. The bed is low to the floor. The TV has an Italian channel (they sure love variety shows in Italy). My comment about the TV is that some channels don't show very good reception. It's time for HD. Lucky for me, my room had no odors. The bathroom was very nice. Lots of marble everywhere. There was a basket of toiletries, including a toothbrush and toothpaste. Water pressure was good. My only complaint is that the shower fixtures must be European (3 controls instead of two). Of course they have the mandatory shower wand that I've always encountered in Europe. I stick with the regular shower head. FYI the room had a separate bath. I paid $1100 for three nights, including tax. For a busy week, that's a great deal.

Instead of a modern deluxe room with a view of the Chrysler building you'll probably get a dated smoke drenched shabby room with a view of three inner sides of the hotel and views into other rooms. The breakfast room hostess kept guests waiting a long time because she preferred to prioritize room phoned in room service orders rather than guests who actually made the effort to come to the breakfast room. Her lack of etiquette, not even a 'Sorry to keep you waiting' and the 'sniffy' attitude of our table waiter was a pain. An attached restaurant (entrance off Madison) charged $12 for a ham/pineapple/feta cheese/pepper sandwich, consisting of dry bread (no butter or mayo) with offputting slabs of boiled ham (I was thinking black forest), a bit of feta cheese and red pepper but no pineapple at all.

There is another room which ends in --66 which looks to be even smaller and I don't think they would be able to fit a queen sized bed in there (so perhaps this is the much maligned standard room occupied by priceliners). The room itself was beautifully designed, just like the website images though it was showing signs of wear and tear -- namely worn carpeting and slight dents and scuffs on the walls. The bathroom was by far my favourite part of the room, it was seperately heated so that it always felt nice and cozy after a shower. Like most old NY buildings, an occasional clanking noise is heard in the pipes. My boyfriend joked that it sounded like a gremlin trying to get out.

It might be ok for a couple of nights but for the following reasons I am trying to get the hotel removed from our \"approved hotels\" listing: - No safes in rooms - only safety deposit boxes at reception, for small items only - Very small rooms (even compared to other hotels in NY in the same price range) - Beds are uncomfortable and badly made - I had to remake the bed almost every day just to get a smooth mattress surface, and to enable for the blankets cover me above my waist (I'm only 5'6\" - this should not be too hard to achieve)! I also got backache from the mattress for the first time in my life (I'm only 28). - Laundry is frequently late, with items missing, always has to be called for (it is never in the room when you return). My colleague had his returned at 11pm, and was woken up by staff banging on the door who then demanded at tip! Why they can't return it in the day like all the other hotels we stay in I don't know... - Keys are notoriously unreliable and need to be inserted several (I'm talking 50-60 times) into the door before you can enter the room. Even the staff have problems with this (when I admit defeat and they come and help me) and twice they had to call the maintenance person to let me into my room. Yet they refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem with the technology. - Breakfast is minimal - but nearby delis are plentiful. - Housekeeping frequently forget to replace certain items like bathmats, small towels etc. There are plenty of other hotels for similar rates nearby - I advise you to go elsewhere unless you are just looking for somewhere for a night or two and won't be bothered by the above irritations - as I agree that the location is good.

Or you may get this barely 2.5 star hotel. I have pricelined rooms since day one of priceline. I have stayed in cities all over the world, and never had a problem. I have booked at least 10 rooms in NYC this year and have had wonderful experiences. That is until I received The Jolly Madison Towers Hotel via a $120 bid on priceline. When I walked in, I knew it was trouble. The lobby was dingy, the walls marred with scratches, pictures askew. The front desk pleasant enough. Get to room and see two twin beds. Now, I had called and requested a double, and I know there is no guarantee. HOWEVER, when I saw the condition of this filthy room, the softness of the beds, the threadbare bedding...I figured the hotel would accommodate with a double. Wrong! I was told totally sold out, etc. I had my laptop with me and asked why I could still get doubles online for that night through their website. \"Well sir, you did bid via priceline, and this is what you get\" Fine. I sucked it up, figured I'd only sleep here. Went out for evening. Came back to find a hallway filled with Chinese menu's, (nice security letting people upstairs to place take out menus under each door!) and crumbs ground into the carpeting. Wait, even better...there was a mouse nibbling away on the crumbs. Key card doesn't work, I go back to the front desk. Told what we saw. The condition of the room, said I am not sleeping on the floor, want to move. Guy at desk actually fakes hitting a button on the computer, says we're sold out. I lean over and look at screen and there is NOTHING there. I say you're faking looking up rooms. Do not insult me. He knew he was had at this point, and set about to just stand his ground. \"Well sir, you pricelined this, and that's the room you get for that!\" If you want another room, it's $100 plus tax.\" I demand to speak with a manager. He says none on duty (it was 12:40 AM) I said, then I want to leave a message. He FAKES pushing a button or two, then pretends to have a conversation with a manager. It was the most obvious fake conversation. He comes back \"Yeah, it's $100\" I said, let me speak to the manager. \"I can't do that sir, he just told you the answer. He will not talk to a customer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said, let me talk to him now, or else. He refuses to call back (since he never made a call anyway) Then proceeds to tell me that perhaps in the future I shouldn't use priceline to book a hotel room, to be ensured I get a good room. I just about lost my mind here. The Italian temper took over and I contained myself (well more like my girlfriend did) I rather strongly said if the hotel participates in priceline, I am still entitled to proper service. We left lobby after I let out a little more anger (I know at this point being nice was getting me no where) He was now faking calling the police. I told him send them on up to my room, I haven't done anything wrong. Needless to say, no cops came. We get in room, A/C was loud as can be. The mattresses were from 1980\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and best of all, we found bugs in the room. That was it. We packed up and left. There was no one at the front desk, so I called this man and told him we were checking out. Got his name and have now filed complaint with priceline, The Jolly Corp and my credit card.

When he showed us our room we where at first quite dissapointed as we had booked a 'superior' room based on the information provided on the Jolly Madison's website. The pictures showed one room but the room we first got was not that room. We gave the bell-hop a $5 tip as this was a recommended price i had read before visiting NY. As soon as i had had a shower i went down to reception to mention the fact that the room was not the room we had paid for. his records apparently showed we had booked a standard room but the invoice i showed him from Thomson stated superior. The staff there was on a whole friendly even though at first nothing could be done regarding our room. We had a call whilst we where out, after staying in the standard room for one night, and a message was left to say that a superior room had became availible at no extra cost so we called down to have our bags moved. Even though we should not have had this trouble to start with i was happy that something had been done about it. The standard room is very small in size and harldy had space for our cases but the superior room was perfect in size and i couldnt have asked for a better room for what we paid (\u00c2\u00a3700 each).

My only problem was that if we had assistance from a bell-hop or concierege in anyway they would almost request a tip from you. I do believe in tipping but not on a compulsary basis. If i receive good service then i will tip but if a person is just doing their job and offers me nothing extra then why should i give them extra money.

We were in a standard room with two double beds, and the room was quite adequate for our needs. I would estimate the size of the room at 14 ft. by 20 ft., with the TV atop a cabinet containing the minibar. The room also had two small chairs with a small table between them, and a fairly large desk. The closet also had a small chest of drawers for storage. The bathroom, while small, was pretty marble. Our room was always clean and there were plenty of towels, but you must ask for washcloths. We should remember that Jolly is an Italian chain, and is pretty much the Italian equivalent of a Holiday Inn. The staff was always courteous and friendly. Manny, one of the doormen, was extremely kind to our daughter and very helpful with suggestions and recommendations. Most of the guests seemed to be Italian business people, not many tourists. The rate we paid for the room included continental breakfast daily, served in restaurant on the mezzanine. It was typical European continental including breads, meats, cheeses, tomatoes, fruit and sweetrolls.

We could have booked a cheaper hotel but looked around for something nice to treat ourselves. We found this hotel and booked two nights with their \"amore special\". This special was supposed to include the room for two nights, champagne, roses, A free dinner for us and continental breakfasts brought to our room in the AM. When we first checked in we noted the room was a little smaller than it looked in the photos and the bathroom was nothing like they showed it in their online ad. We had dinner the first night downstairs after a long trip around 8:30PM and then retired to the room for the night. The next day breakfast was outside the door (like the special said it was supposed to be) and we lounged around and rested until leaving about 4pm to go out to dinner and attend the concert. We came back from the concert at around 11:30pm only to find that the door to out room was ajar and the lights we had turned off were on. We also noted missing things, like a CD player with a CD in it and a bottle of perfume which was taken out of the bag in the bathroom. Security was called and my fiancee went down to report the break in. The security guard came to the room and while he was there a woman across the hall opened her door to tell the security officer that she had heard someone going in and out of the room about an hour before we had returned from the concert. There was no way it was housekeeping because the bed was not made up nor were there any new towels or bathroom items added that we used that morning. We had all of our credit cards with us and nothing else seemed to be missing. we were told that we would be called about the break in. The next morning, breakfast was again outside the door and we hurridly got ready to leave and went to check out on the TV as we usually do when we noted that we had been charged for our dinner, both morning continental breakfasts which angered us. We had to leave or we would have missed the train so we called the office and were told to call the next day and they would take care of it. We called and wrote to the hotel. We emailed them and faxed them. Nothing. We were never even apologized to for the break in and we were never reimbursed for the dinner and the continental breakfasts (Coffees, danish, juice charged 32.00 each AM) I am still trying to get them to reimburse us for the dinner and the breakfasts because it was supposed to be included in the package but I doubt we will ever hear from them again. We spoke with people who had stayed at the pennsylvania hotel across from MSG and they paid less than half of what we paid and had better rooms and service. I highly recommend that if you go to this hotel, that you check in and make sure they have the package marked and do not leave by dicharging yourself by the TV services. I am so dissapointed in this hotel and when I have called, I have been told very sarcastically that they cannot help me on the phone and I have to write. when I write, they do not respond to my letters. There are plenty of other hotels in the area which are cheaper and nicer and do not take advantage of their clients. The Jolly Madison did a \"switch and Bait\" and I did not expect this from a hotel of this size and ratings. Very very poor service and do not assist their guests.

Location was good, about 5 minutes from the Empire State building. Be careful getting a taxi back to the airport, always choose a yellow cab whatever the porter says!!! Works out cheaper :-) Would not stay here again, much better hotels in New York for the price we paid!", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Jolly Hotel Madison Towers", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d93470-Reviews-Jolly_Hotel_Madison_Towers-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$175 - $355*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">22 East 38th street (corner of Madison Avenue)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10016</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "93470", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/73/aa/8d/the-deluxe-rooms-are.jpg"}}

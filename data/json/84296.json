The last day we were there we got the dog out early. When we checked out and told him the dog was at a vets for 2 days, and showed him the receipt, he took off 2 days of dog charges. The place was clean, and the staff friendly. The resturant in the hotel was too expensive for us. We read online some bad reviews on this place, however we did not find this to be true. Maybe the writers were having a bad day.

We had a room on the second floor facing a residential area. Parking was hard as there is a rental car agency on the premises. We had to park on a side street. We were out of the hotel on Friday. When we returned Friday evening (around 6-8 pm), we immediately were aware that the room had not been serviced/cleaned. The beds were not made, and the used wet towels were on the floor. We went down to the front desk, and informed the clerk. He said, \"Do you want some coffee\"? No, we wanted the room serviced. We asked for towels, and he brought 4 bath towels - that is all, no bath mat, washcloths, or hand towels. We were out of the hotel on Saturday, and when we returned late Saturday, the room had been serviced. Sunday, the room was not serviced again, and we went once again to the front desk. After visiting the front desk several times, and leaving multiple messages for the general manager, AND having to put up with a housekeeping supervisor tell us \"we had other rooms to clean, we cannot worry about your room\", and her hanging up on me, the maid finally came to clean the room at 4 in the afternoon!! Sunday evening, the phone began to ring approximately every 30-40 minutes; it was like a constant wake up call. After having the phones acting like this, we finally went again to the front desk at 4:30 in the morning, informed the desk clerk, who then said \"just unplug the phone.\" No member of management ever contacted us, despite provided multiple messages for the manager as we needed to address our concerns. We also provided our cell phone number when we checked out and asked again repeatedly to be contacted. We filed a formal complaint with the hotel chain and were informed that the manager informed the corporate office that we were the ones rude to their staff, not the other way around. The corporate office indicates that the management was not willing/able to provide any type of compensation for the unpleasant stay with the rude staff. We advise everyone reading this to not, under any circumstances, plan a hotel stay at the Best Western in Coral Gables Florida. You will be throwing your money out of the window and into the hands of the management. Even if you have to drive a long distance, find another hotel chain as this one will not address your concerns, and the management does not care. A word to the wise: Read the description on the hotel's website, but be very very very careful on the wording - read between the lines. Beware on staying there, (unless of course, you have money to burn and a penchant for a terrible hotel visit), and are willing to put up with rude staff who are unwilling to assist and a management team who is always \"unavailable\" to address your concerns (except when contacted by the corporate office - then they are willing to make up stories to the corporate headquarters to make the hotel management look good)/", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFine for the Price and our Purposes\u201d", "Author": "JustOneBoomer", "ReviewID": "UR5968246", "Content": "We ended up at this hotel when the hotel we had originally booked claimed we had not booked more than one night and could not accomodate us (The St. Michel).

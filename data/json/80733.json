First night room had an old, fuzzy TV. My advice if you choose this hotel with its ridiculous \"can't change your mind\" check out policy, book a two bed room because the price difference is worth the amenities including a table and chairs for eating. That's important because there is no central dining area; it's eat in your room. Breakfast is sparse compared to similar priced accommodations. Food choice is pretty much waffles or a piece of fruit. Hotel Row is home to all brands of hotels and a great location because it is the Interstate service road essentially; is located just across from a major shopping center with movie theater, restaurants (Cheesecake Factory is a stand out), etc; easy access to Interstate facilities getting to Things To Do.

The beds were very comfortable and we did not find the area noisy at all. (we stayed in Room 207) What we liked most was the charm of being able to park right outside our room. I miss the days of being able to do that, rather than have to park in some huge structure and feel like you have to walk a mile down many hallways just to get to your room.

Clean bedspread & linens, plenty of towels, etc. All ice machines in good working condition at all times of the day & night. Downstairs room very quiet 3 out of 4 nights.

Gave up trying to sleep & hit the road at 3 a.m. Suggestions for travelers: request an upstairs room if you absolutely need a full night's uninterrupted sleep. Suggestions for front-desk employees: gently remind upstairs occupants that the floors are thin and to be considerate of downstairs neighbors. Walk on thin ice/tip-toe after 10 p.m. Suggestion for management: Hotel carpets are always an issue with me & many fellow travelers. Is cleaning/shampooing the carpets once a month realistic?

I felt the room was clean and the maid service did a good job. They do seem to be reluctant to give extra towels for some reason though. The one thing that was kind of bothersome were the knats that were in the room when we checked in. I think the maids leave the doors open while cleaning and they enter then with all the trees surrounding the facility. This could easily be fixed with better awareness. Also, the in-room safe did not work. Make sure you get the $2 per day charge removed from your bill if it does not work. It was laready included on my bill and would not have been removed if I had not said anything. Leo, in the office was very helpful and pleasant during our breakfast visits. And the breakfast itself was what I have come to expect.....your basic waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, muffins (weekends only), milk, juice, coffee.....more than adequate. Be aware that parking is VERY limited. If you return late on a weekend night when the hotel is at capacity, you will not find a place to park. This happend to me, and after going into the front office to ask for help I was told to park in the \"overflow\" lot out back (which looked like a homeless camp), or pay $17 to park next door at the Marriott. I chose to park at the hotel on the end of an aisle that was technically not a parking stall, but did the job and was out of the way. In the morning I saw that others who returned even later than I did had the same problems and some even parked in the landscaped areas. They really need to address the parking problem.

Our son has lived in San Diego for 5 years. Periodically we visit. The Vagabond is the 3rd hotel we've tried, and the ONly one we've returned to (that should say everything!). Try finding a cheaper, cleaner alternative in the San Diego area than The Vagabond. It's not going to be an easy task. 4 nights' stay, taxes INCLUDED, came to around $270 ($67.50/night). For this we got: -a decent-sized CLEAN room (unlike the hotel down the street where we previously stayed. -free parking (UNlike a unnamed hotel nearby that charges $16/day to park). -free wireless internet that works well. -a safe in-room -in-room microwave -in-room refrigerator -iron/ironing board; they'll lend you a hair dryer -a very nice comfortable king-size bed. the pillows were nice, too. -a free continental breakfast every morning (fresh fruit, coffee, milk, cereal, wafflemakers) -TV and desk area in-room During our most recent trip, my wife and I stayed in 3 different hotels in Las Vegas and San Diego. The Vagabond had the most comfortable bed. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I slept like a baby, and I am a pretty light sleeper. The location is within walking distance to other hotels in the circle (restaurants), there is a convenience store next door, and you can walk to Fashion Valley Mall in about 10 minutes. I should mention that we had a vehicle at our disposal (my son lent us his truck). The hotels on Hotel Circle are right next to the freeway (I-8). If you are not going to have a vehicle you should probably stay downtown. Other than that, The Vagabond is great. Regretfully, we may never stay at The Vagabond again.

The AAA price of 59 dollars a night was fantastic, and the help was very friendly and pleasant, but there were some issues I had. First off, the water heater is extremely finicky and often spurts out cold water without warning for a minute or two before returning to it's previous state. On top of this the rooms are fairly small, and not at all what I expected from viewing their images on this website and others. Our room was also extremely noisy as traffic can be heard quite clearly from the room. If I had to describe the level of sound I would say it was almost like the window was open, but I have checked and double checked everything only to find that the gaps in the door are to blame (to which we can do nothing about.) It is easily heard over the television. After finding these issues to be too unpleasant for the price and the vacation I had in mind, I asked if I could either upgrade or cancel my second nights stay, and they informed me that they had no better rooms available, and then denied me the chance to cancel the next day due to their 24 hour cancellation policy. This gesture should speak for the hotel more than I can - they denied me sleep and hot water but they still expect to be paid for the next nights stay. So if you merely need a place to stay the night (not a vacation,) and you have no trouble falling asleep, then look no further - the staff is quite friendly and there is a refrigerator AND microwave in the room... but if you are looking for a vacation, or are a light sleeper, I advise you stay away. It's just not worth it.

Wifi is free and parking is free. (Town and Country charges $8 a day for parking!) The front desk staff is also very nice and helpful. However, their clientele is what bothered me. On Friday night we were in a room near the pool but we had just arrived, so we had jet lag and wanted to sleep. The kids running in and out of their rooms and slamming the doors was a problem. So was the highway noise. Then we moved into a room farther back in the complex. That solved the highway noise. But on Sat. night a big brother was wrestling his little brother and slamming him into the walls, doors, and railing all the way down the hallway. Finally on Sun night at 4:30 in the morning behind my head board there was a domestic dispute going on with a man yelling, \"I'm going to kill you, you f***ing b**ch.\" Then Mon-Thurs. was just fine and then on Friday evening the pimp mobiles started showing up in the parking lot again.

When you pull up to the Vagabond you immediately start to think it can't be that nice but when you enter the room you will be impressed beyond belief. They must have recently remodeled.

I was looking for a low-budget hotel that was reasonably clean and close to things. I found a great Internet rate on the hotel's website so decided to give it a try. The pluses...nice pool and jacuzzi. There are two pools, one heated and one unheated. Since it was cool, we used the heated pool as well as the jacuzzi. The pool and spa were clean and well-maintained. The breakfast was limited, but they did have the waffle maker which my kids love. The waffles were better than others we have had, probably because the waffle maker was newer and the non-stick coating still worked. There is no area to sit and eat, so we took the food to a table by the pool and that was very pleasant. The rooms were sizeable with two queens in our room...I was traveling with two of my daughters and we had plenty of room. And the mattresses were comfortable....both my children said that they felt like they were sleeping in their own beds. Now for the minuses...when I checked in, the desk clerk handed me a bill for over $300 to pay in full. Since my rate with tax was just over $80.00 for the night, I was puzzled. I showed him my reservation and he realized he had retrieved the wrong traveler record. They were in the middle of charging it to my credit card and had to void it. Upon checkout, they overcharged me $2 or so. I went back to my car and found the record. The desk clerk thought it was the fee for the safe. Yet, I checked before arrival and upon arrival to confirm there were to be no extra fees. The room had a funky mildewy smell. We asked to be switched and the second room had the same smell, but not as strong. I thought we could stand it for a night. I also saw an unoccupied room open next door. I went in for a moment and it also had that same smell. While there, my daughter's exzema flared up the worst it has in quite some time... I have to wonder if the mildew odor in the air was a factor. The shower was also difficult to regulate and the refrigerator did not work. Maintenance came up quickly and showed me how to regulate the shower temperature. He fiddled around with the refrigerator and got it working too. So I have to say they did try to respond to my requests. If you are not fussy and don't have keen sense of smell, this is an ok place to stay. It does have some things going for it, and the price was great.

The Vagabond is a good deal however, and worth a bit more than the daily hotel rate. The property is clean and well situated.

Our room had a fridge, microwave, tv and powerful air conditioner. The rooms and the property were quiet enough. The room did have an odd smell, but it didn't bother us. The breakfast includes cereal, coffee, OJ, apples and oranges and waffles. The idea is to come to the lobby and get your food, then take it with you to your room or sit by the pool and eat. You can easily walk to a local diner (good food), mini-mart, gas station. Highway 8 is very close. The hotel needs to have more towels for a San Diego visitor.

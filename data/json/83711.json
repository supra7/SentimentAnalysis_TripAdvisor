I was then given another room and the front desk lady quoted it had a \"view of the car park\". Maybe a few years ago it did but all I could see was something resembling a film set from Tarzan. Anyhow no noise so we started to unpack and look for the fridge to put our drinks in. Quickly realised there was no fridge so phoned down and to my astonishment I was told that the room did not come with a fridge. This is Southern California were the temperatures hit 80 in December and no fridge in a supposed 3 star hotel room !!! An hour or so later we decide to head out for some dinner and look to put our valuables in the room safe. Next problem is that there appears to be no room safe. Another call to the front desk confirms this to be case but now informed that I could upgrade for $20 per night. I decline this offer. On returning to the hotel that evening, I enquire about the complimentary buffet breakfast and I am told this has been suspended. I tell the front desk person that I have the words \"complimentary buffet breakfast\" on my reservation and he asks to see it. He then photocopies this sheet and tells me to go down to the restaurant in the morning and simply order items off the breakfast menu which will not be charged to the room. Next morning I enjoy breakfast but problems now occur at the end of the meal when I get the bill. I tell the waiter it is free and he looks surprised so calls one of the managers and who inform me that the complimentary buffet breakfast has been discontinued. I explain to him that I have already had this discussion with the front desk guy the previous evening and again show him my confirmation. He then shows it to someone else and it is agreed that the breakfast be charged to my room but they will remove it daily. While not totally satisfactory, I accept this solution because in reality there is nothing else possible. My next few days pass without hassle apart from the minor inconvenience in the restaurant where a large orange juice at breakfast apparently comes in 3 different sizes according to which waiter or waitress is working that morning. However I did find the breakfast themselves good quality. Departing the hotel really sealed the fate of this establishment. In the early hours of our final day, an invoice was put under my door and unbelievably I had been charged for breakfast for the last two days. As we were catching a 6.40am flight I dealt with the night manager who was unaware of the situation regarding my breakfasts and took yet another copy of my reservation but he looked on his system and thankfully he took off the last 2 breakfasts. If the above wasn't enough, for good measure the wakeup call I requested for 3.05am never materialised but that really doesn't matter in the scheme of things.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Millbrae, CA", "Title": "\u201cBasic Extended Stay Type Of Hotel\u201d", "Author": "WillieMillbrae", "ReviewID": "UR21509446", "Content": "Stayed here twice, once in Feb 2008 and again in Oct 2008.

One night after our arrival, the hotel was invaded by a horde of youth girl soccer players, parents and coaches. To say that these people were noisy, unruly and inconsiderate would be a sweeping understatement. The parents were even worse. They seemed to think that the hallways were an extension of their rooms for their gatherings. As our suite was at ground floor level facing the pool, it was particularly noisy. I went to the front desk to complain about the noise and to ask to be moved. The manager on duty said the hotel was filled for this big tournament and that the staff would stop the noise at 10 pm (which they didn't!). This invasion lasted for the next three nights and ruined our expectations of relaxing in our suite and by the pool. We changed our plans to minimize the time we spent at the hotel. The staff should have been forthright in warning us about the soccer group when we checked in, should have put us into a quieter suite from the outset or certaintly should have moved us when we requested. The property itself is nice for its class, the rooms and suites are spacious,and it has a very nice restaurant.

Kitchenette: large fridge, dishwasher, small stovetop (no oven), toaster, dishes, dishcloths & d/w soap provided (no dish soap provided - oversight by maid?) Small salt & pepper, sugar packets, coffee. Awkward layout for groceries. Master bedroom: large king bed, microsuede duvet cover, very comfortable. Plenty of TV channels, but NO DVD player (only in main room). Bathroom: nice soaps, large layout, medium shower pressure. Main area: fold out couch was good for one kid. Enough room to add a cot. TV seemed small in the space, but was fine. Awkward placement for the TV behind the desk, so anyone working on a computer there would block the TV (fine since there was another TV in the bedroom). Internet: rooms only have a plug-in connection and a charge for this service. The Internet cable barely reaches into the bedroom and the hotel should consider longer ones. Free Internet is available in the lobby and restaurant areas. Restaurant: happy hour was fun; mini Kobe beef burgers half price ($7) and tasty. Located next to the pool area. Surprised that breakfast was NOT included in the price of the room -- we did not try it. Chili's was the nearest walking distance restaurant. Other: Laundry service expensive. $7.50 to launder a shirt. Cheaper to go to Target/Old Navy and buy a new one. Also, they do accept pets. Pool was very warm, but the kids loved it. Some seating is still in the splash zone, so watch your laptop. A variety of DVDs to rent (a deposit is charged to the room, but removed when DVD is returned). Small store near lobby but expensive.

The television sets did seem a bit small, but as we don't even own a TV it wan't really a big issue for us. The staff was decent, but not overly helpful. When I went to check out the morning of the marathon there were three employees chatting and they continued to do so for about a minute while I waited for them to finish up. Once they attended to me they were very pleasant to me as well as my two year old son, talking to him and being very cordial. I location of the Woodfin is bit of a drive from dowtown San Diego, Mission Valley, and most San Diego attractions but quite do-able if you have a car. The neighborhood is comprised of modern office buildings with not a whole lot of restaurants in the immediate area, there are however plenty down the street about a 5-10 minute drive. I would reccommend this hotel for families in which the adults would appreciate the privacy of a seperate bedroom.

For the past 10 years, I've come to Boston to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day and have stayed at various locations... when I found this one last year, I can't imagine staying anywhere else. The location is super easy to get to off 90 and they have valet parking. Last year we did self park (there is a Marriott across the street that offers garaged parking) but this year we did the valet mostly because we were staying longer and had more luggage - didn't want to have to drag it across the busy intersection. I think the valet parking cost an extra $5 or $10... not too bad. Upon parking the vehicle, the doorman came out to greet us immediately and escorted us in while offering to help with our bags. Check in took all of three minutes and they were able to accommodate our request for a room on a high floor (6th floor our of 7, pretty good). There are two elevators... one is tiny with a narrow doorway. There is another one that is a little further past the tiny one that doesn't seem to be used a lot - this one is good when hauling bags! The common hallways are very wide and beautifully decorated but the rooms are small. But I expect this with a boutique hotel. We had a room with two double beds (SUPER COMFY), a rather large closey, and a decent sized bathroom. In fact, the closet was so large, it makes you wonder why they didn't incorporate some of that space into the regular room. But again, its a boutique hotel so I think they are limited with the placement of the walls - the building is pretty old. In the evening a housekeeper came to drop off a couple of (complimentary) water bottles. The room had a large Poland Spring bottle for sale at $5... Shaws next door was selling the saem size for $0.83. The complimentary bottles and the Shaws bottles were good enough for us! Checking out was just as easy - the valet parking was added to the hotel bill. They tell you it may take 15-20 minutes to bring your car around but it seems to be much less for mine. I did notice my car was pretty filthy... it was raining the day we checked in and it looked like it was under something dripping dirty rain water. It rubbed right off when I touched it so it didn't concern me - I think when you're parking in a city garage things like this are to be expected. The location just cannot be beat. There are T stations within walking distance and Boyleston and Newbury street are only a couple blocks away. Lots of shopping and pubs! I will definitely recommend this hotel to others and will be staying again and again. Thanks Copley Square Hotel staff for making this another truly successful St. Patricks Day weekend!!!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trumbull, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cSimply Awesome!\u201d", "Author": "Charles A", "ReviewID": "UR126299208", "Content": "Great Decor,Awesome Rooms, Friendly Staff, Clean, Convenient and Complimentary Wine in the lounge every night 5-6pm!

Just stayed here during a massive blackout (March 2012) when the entire Back Bay lost power for 36 hours because a transformer exploded in the nearby Hilton. I can't say enough about the staff and general manager, they went WAY above and beyond to take care of everybody. I was there for a conference, but had brought my girlfriend with me, and we were just walking up to the entrance when every building downtown lost power. Minutes after the power went out, they offered my girlfriend and me (free) glasses of red wine as we were waiting in the dark to check in. Most of the guests could not get key cards made due to the power loss, so the staff would walk us to our rooms and open the door for us every time. The rooms are equal or higher quality compared to the other high-end hotels in the area, but the hotel is small enough that they are able to give a personal touch that you don't get at the Westin or Sheraton. They have a great restaurant and bar as well, which continued to serve throughout the blackout. Also, when the power hadn't come back on after 18 hours, they helped people book rooms in other other hotels that had power.

The main draw is the location- literally a one-minute walk to Copley Place/Prudential Center malls. Two minute walk to Boylston and Newbury Streets. Definitely can't beat this location! In terms of the actual hotel- very courteous staff. The valet, concierge, and other staff were all friendly and helpful. In the reservation notes I mentioned that we were there to celebrate a birthday and upon check-in, my wife was handed a birthday card hand signed by the hotel staff. It was a nice touch that I doubt would have happened anywhere else. I would agree with the other reviews I've read- the rooms are...tiny. Not small, but tiny. That's not to say that our room wasn't tastefully decorated and very clean. I imagine most folks will spend their time wandering around Boston but if you are planning to spend a considerable amount of time in your hotel room, I would think twice before staying here. Following suit, the bathroom was tiny as well. Again, not a deal breaker but if you're claustrophobic, the bathroom will definitely throw you for a loop. With a hotel this small, noise also become an issues. The hallways are about 3 feet wide so you can hear other people entering/exiting their rooms. There is also a club inside the hotel and even on the 5th floor (out of 8), we could hear people laughing and carrying on at 1am. It really comes down to preference- if you don't mind paying a little extra (plus $40+ for parking) to stay smack dab in the middle of Back Bay and avoid unnecessary travel time to/from the city, this place works great.

It is located in a great spot right by Copley Square, two blocks to the T and within walking distance to the Esplanade, the Commons, Fenway Park, a ton of restaurants of all kinds and many colleges and universities. The people have always been wonderful, though I have only had to deal with the front desk staff (not housekeeping or valet). They are always pleasant and helpful in a relaxed, yet sincere manner. On my last trip, I suddenly found that I needed to stay one more day and even though they were charging almost double what I had paid for the previous three days due to a major convention that was in town, they let me stay that extra night at my original price. The rooms are a little small, but perfectly adequate. Often it's because it is an old and oddly shaped building so the rooms are tucked in here and there--it's rather quaint. That said, the rooms are also very stylish and sophisticated without pretense. The other nice thing is that they have free wi-fi; something a lot of the \"high end\" hotels gouge you for at $15+/night (can you say Fairmont!?). The other nice feature they have is the 5:00pm \"Wine Down\" where they offer complimentary wine in their lobby/lounge for an hour, three glasses maximum per person. It's not the best wine, but it's not the worst--I would buy it for my own home as an average dinner wine. The only two things I was not pleased with or found detracted from an otherwise great place was the breakfast--both the service and the quality. The service was very slow and slightly unprofessional (maybe a new guy??) and the price for what you get is on the ridiculous side of things, especially given all the great restaurants all around the hotel. The other thing, and it's really only something I experienced from a distance and in no way impacted my stay, is the \"hip\" night club/lounge they have. It just seemed a bit trite and came off as trying way to hard given how relaxed and casual (but utterly professional) they are in all other aspects.

Some people say it is noisy, and it is true that it is on Huntington and it is sort of a \"traffic\" zone, but I didn't notice any excessive noise at all. I could hear the cars going by if I listened for them, but with the windows closed, it was barely noticeable. I suppose if you kept the windows open during traffic times, it might be more distracting. (for reference, I stayed on the 3rd floor on the Huntington St side). As far as room size, I thought both of our bedrooms (family suite) were very nicely sized. They might be bigger than the average room, but I thought there was plenty of room to move around and even a nice sitting area. That being said, it's not the biggest room that I have ever stayed in, but for Boston, where space is at a premium downtown, it is spacious. You have to keep in mind what the area offers otherwise. I will concur that the bathroom is a little bit small. Even for our Family Suite, I was surprised they were able to fit a sink, toilet and tub/shower in a room that small, there was barely enough room to turn around, but no points down on that for me. I'm hopefully not spending enough time in the bathroom that it should matter. The shower/tub was comfortably sized, so that was good enough for me. I guess the only gripe I had relating to the size was the lack of towel bars. There was only one towel bar which was occupied with the hand towels, that's it. It was sort of difficult to help them be ecologically friendly and hang up our towels (to indicate they didn't need to be replaced) when there was no where to hang them. And I was in a room set up that had two rooms sharing one bathroom. Would be a simple fix. Price-wise, I thought it was very reasonable for the area and the quality. It's lesser expensive than the very nearby Westin and Marriott, but very comparable (if not better) in quality. Final notes - bar and restaurant were nice. I didn't try food, but the drinks were good and layout was great. The wine hour each night was a nice touch. Free wi-fi is always nice - I'm so used to big hotels that STILL charge additional for internet. All in all, I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to others. You can find lesser expensive places to stay in Boston - but not in this prime location or at this quality.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cRepeat Customer\u201d", "Author": "Mia P", "ReviewID": "UR120341975", "Content": "I've stayed at the Copley Sq twice on business.

On our 2nd stay we selected the Premier room and it was at a discounted rate in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month. In the a.m. they have water bottles and towels in the lobby for those heading out for an early morning run. Every evening at 5pm they host \"wine down hour\" with free glasses of wine in the lobby for guests and visitors. Location was ideal for us as we took the Amtrak train into Back Bay Station. It is only a couple mins walk from the station, but intersections got rather annoying to cross. We were looking for an apartment either in the South End or Back Bay and this hotel provided easy walking distance to both. On our second trip we chose to valet park our car which was only $10 more than a garage down the street and way more convenient with all our luggage (and dog). Dinner down in the restaurant was pretty good. There is also a big Shaw's right across Exeter St. so you can stock up on drinks, food, etc. We also went to a Trader Joe's 5 mins away down Boyston St. Going out to dinner we headed towards the South End vs. Back Bay. The gym is small but has enough to get in quick run on the treadmill and some stretching. The lobby has a dark, chic decor but the rooms are very light and airy. Bathrooms are really quite nice.

I would pay full price for this hotel! We booked through Priceline, although their website was only about $20 more. I sent the hotel an email requesting a king, higher floor room away from elevators and mentioned we were celebrating my husband's birthday. We arrived at noon and didn't expect our room to be ready but wanted to leave our bag while we were out and about. The woman checking us in was very welcoming and once I gave her my name addressed us as Mr. XXX and Mrs. XXX. She wished my husband a happy birthday and then handed him a card. She said we were being upgraded and that the room wasn't ready just yet...which we were fine with since it was so early in the day. We left our bag and went to the lobby seating area and had some lemon infused water...perfect on a hot summer day. We opened the card she had given my husband and it was a birthday card handsigned by numerous staff members. VERY nice gesture. We go away for each of our birthdays each year and this is the first hotel to give us a card. We've been upgraded before, but not had a card and upgrade. VERY nice customer service. She also asked if we needed any reservations, directions, etc. Helpful and friendly, but not intrusive. We came back later in the day and went up to our room. The hotel has seven floors and we were given a room on the 6th away from elevators as requested. The room was gorgeous, modern and clean. As others have noted, the bathroom was smaller than average, but I wasn't planning on holding a party in there, so it was more than adequate. Very large shower stall, but no tub, which is fine with me since I'm not a bath person. Vanity is freestanding with not much space on top, but has a glass shelf above and shelf underneath. The bed was glorious. Great linens and firm mattress. Some reviews have mentioned traffic noise at this hotel or others in Boston. This should be expected when one is visiting a city and there were no noises out of the ordinary. Got a great night's sleep and I'm a light sleeper. We had room service breakfast. Ordered coffee, fruit plate, and yogurt with granola/fruit. Received a callback confirming we wanted fruit plate and yogurt with fruit--not sure what the confusion was about. Food came in about 15-20 minutes as they had noted. Nice fresh fruit and a big pot of coffee with all the trimmings.

The room: We stayed in a room on the third floor. It was a small room facing Exeter Street, but it was comparable in size to what one would find in Europe. The building itself is a renovated heritage-type building and a lot of that charm still remains after renovations. The room had a contemporary design but was complimented with the vintage feel of the mouldings and trim. The bathroom: It was small and somewhat functional, likely attributed to the age of the building. While it had modern pieces, it was a bit awkward to get around. The rather large walk-in shower was a pleasant surprise, but it was behind the open door. The staff: Everyone from the maintenance staff to the doormen were quick to offer smiles and a salutation. We did not order room service, but we did talk to the staff at the main desk for directions and recommendations. Not only were the staff pleasant, but -- to us -- they seemed to want to make sure we were going to enjoy ourselves. We had to print off a ticket and while there is no \"business centre\" at the hotel, staff accommodated our needs by allowing us to use their computers to print things off.

Upon arrival I was promptly greeted and the concierge was eager to help during my stay. I value great service and I definitely received that at Copley Sq. The location is also unbeatable, within walk distance of shopping on Newbury and in the malls, dinning, and watering holes. The only cons of the hotel are the size (and cost) of the standard queen bed room and lack of late night dining options. I had a ~210 sq ft room with a queen bed, so there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much room for hanging about (but as I learned one wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s days in a hotel room while on vacation!). The bathroom, which was very clean, was tiny with just enough room for one to take a few steps, but not more. The bed was very comfortable and clean, closely rivaling my bed at home. I found the lack of late night dining options an inconvenience; however there are late night spots located in the area given that Northeastern University is located about 10 minutes from the hotel. Pizza from BHOP was the meal de jour. The place is loud and littered with NU and Wentworth kids, so beware. Copley Sq. Hotel is also home to the popular MiniBar and Saint lounge. I spent my time at Minibar, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience Saint, which has gotten mixed reviews from the locals. Minibar is cool, but service was hit or miss. Some bartenders were attentive while others couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t handle the volume of customers. To be sure, it was good time as I had my beautiful girl friend occupying my time. Overall, Copley Sq Hotel is an excellent option for those who want to stay in a chic hotel in the heart Backbay, but also want to avoid the corporate like atmosphere of the nearby hotels such as the Westin and Fairmont.

We were actually there so that my husband could attend a conference at the Marriott across the street but I also went with our two small children (3 yrs old and a 10 month old). I usually opt out of tagging along on business trips because being stuck in one hotel room with two small children is not my idea of fun. This suite was phenomenal- you enter the suite by walking into a small hallway and off the hallway there is a small but very new and clean bathroom. The two bedrooms are also off this small hallway. Both rooms contain king beds with desks, chairs and a cozy modern couch. One room also has a closet in it big enough to fit a pack n' play- therefore we were able to put our son in one bedroom and our baby in the closet and enjoy some alone time in the bedroom. The bedrooms are both very large and we found them to be very, very quiet. There is some street noise (expected in Boston!) but being on the fourth floor - which is not very high- it was not that bad. I heard nearly no hallway noise or noise from other hotel guestrooms. The beds were very comfortable and everything is very clean and obviously fairly new (apparently they renovated the entire place about 1.5 yrs ago). The staff was very, very helpful and polite. We ate breakfast at their restaurant and also ordered room service one night- all our food experiences and service experiences were great. I was concerned that we would feel uncomfortable or not as welcome since it is obviously a fairly hip place to hang out in the evenings (they have a nice bar area)- but this was definitely not the case at all. The location was excellent- a very easy and close walk to the Copley T stop as well as an easy walk to the public gardens, public library and tons of shopping and restaurants. Oh, and a Shaws grocery store is literally next door in the Prudencial building. We were able to buy some things for breakfast and lunch and keep them in our refrigerator (which I requested).

It was disappointing to find that there was no fridge, dust around the skirting and lampshades, bed sheets that had small stains on them and a very small bathroom that could be described as 'fairly' clean. Generally, the Hotel Copley is a 'nice' place to stay, if one has payed up to \u00c2\u00a3150 per night for the room.

I was looking for a hotel with a very deluxe feel and the Copley Square Hotel, which bills itself as a deluxe boutique hotel, seemed to fill the bill. Because I was traveling with another colleague who had a reservation at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel, I was able to compare rooms. Both hotel rooms cost approximately the same. However, my colleague did get at upgrade at the Fairmont so keep that in mind. My room at the Copley Square Hotel was a deluxe premium king so it was a very good room, only surpassed I believe by suites and corner deluxe premium kings. The room was newly decorated since the hotel has had a recent refurbishing. The colors were a little dark -- muted browns and greys. It was fairly spacious but not nearly as large as my colleague's room at the Fairmont, which was almost double the size. In addition, the bathroom was tiny -- so small that if you stood in it, you could only turn around -- you couldn't take one step in it. When I first got there, I was stymied by the lights in the bathroom. I couldn't figure out where they were. I even felt along the walls thinking they might blend into the wallpaper. I finally found them hidden under the towels. Incidentally, my partner, who checked in after me, had the exact same experience and had to call down to the front desk for help. So it wasn't just me. This bathroom, done in very conventional tile, was particularly annoying compared to the Fairmont's which was in marble and nearly 3 times bigger. Noise was a problem in this hotel. The hotel prides itself on being chic and trendy and has a bar to go with it. The problem is that when the bar closes at 2 am, the crowd gathers outside on the street and keeps you up. The soundprroofing in the windows seems non-existent. The hotel cannot both have its cake and eat it. It is clearly profiting greatly from its lively bar scene but this does cause a noise problem which it hasn't dealt with. Room service was not existent during the day and only started at 5 pm, aside from breakfast. My meetings actually allowed me some in room time in the middle of the day. I would have liked room service so I could work without having to go out to a restaurant. This was very annoying. In addition, room service closed at 11 pm. In a hotel that places itself in the deluxe category, not having room service in the middle of the day is almost unheard of. Finally, some of the front desk people were clearly more used to serving as chic and trendy ornaments than well-trained in taking care of clients' needs.

A carpeted stairway with wooden banisters stood between two glossy elevators; the hallways were attractively fashioned. As a boutique hotel, the downstairs decor was wonderfully chic.

Had to walk down the road to supermarket and get something there (woman at desk who recommended this was nice and in general the staff was very pleasant).

Parking in the garage is quite pricey ($40/night?) but both times we were able to find a spot right on the street. We had to feed the meter every 2 hours until 7:00, but it was worth it. The beds at the Copley couldn't be more comfortable. I would love to have one here at home! The rooms are small, but more than adequate for one couple. The bathrooms were very clean, had fluffy towels and plenty of counter space. The only complaint we had was during our second stay. We had upgraded to a premier edge room which overlooked two city streets, and the room was quite chilly, even though we were able to control our own thermostat. (There were a lot of windows with great views, but we had to keep the drapes shut in order to keep out drafts.) The hotel has some nice on-site entertainment. The Mini-bar is quite trendy and has great cocktails. It reaches capacity quickly on the weekends, so go early. The restaurant was beautifully appointed and had good food. There is a nightclub in the basement of the hotel. It also got quite crowded, even though there are several rooms. I'd recommend this spot to younger adults. We 40-somethings felt a bit out of place!

I was offered an upgrade for what amounted to \u00c2\u00a39pn inc taxes and I am so glad I took it....the room was absolutely beautiful, as someone with very similar taste in my own home I appreciated the decor. Apart from being huge (it was a corner room) and well furnished the 6' bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Overall it was great value and I appreciated not having to pay the premium associated with upkeeping garndiose public rooms. The reception staff are very young - probably all in their early 20s - but have a real professionalism and committment to customer satisfaction, although I didn't take advantage of this from the range of services on offer it would appear that nothing was too much trouble. The wine tasting was a nice touch after a long day of sightseeing but in truth would probably not impress a connoisseur. The Copley Square Hotel has a great location, withn the close vicinity to the Fairmont, Weston, Marriot and Lennox within a stone's throw of Copley T. Everything in Boston and Cambridge is within walking distance (I walked to Harvard and back via the MFA but the average tourist might prefer not to!!), Boston offers so much history, entertainment, nice restaurants etc and is an ideal place for a clutural break.

There's a nice sized desk across from the comfortable bed and the flat screen TV is on the amoire to the side- slightly inconvenient for watching from bed.

Had a Fabulous time.\u201d", "Author": "nenornchik", "ReviewID": "UR54169819", "Content": "I want to point out the important parts of our trip because these were the things that sold me on this hotel and this location. Sorry it's a little long but a review is what sold me on this hotel. **The T -- First and foremost take advantage of the T. No need for cabs in Boston when they have an amazing subway system and very clean and very safe. So if you've never been to a city with a subway have no fear. This was our first trip to Boston. We stayed 4 days and wish we had stayed a week. Get to know the T before you go so you know where to get off when you leave the airport. There is a bus that will take you from the airport to the T station, if you can't find it when you get off the plane, ask somebody, they will help you. We got off at Copley and when you get out of the station at the street level, cross the street, walk in front of the library, turn the corner up to Huntington Ave and the Copley Square Hotel will be right in front of you. Don't worry if you don't see the sign, it's on the other side. **The Hotel -- The hotel was amazing. It is a very old hotel that has been completely remodeled and is very modern. I really liked the feel of it because it was a more intimate setting. They do have 2 elevators so if you get on the small one don't worry that's the original one which I thought was very cool, the larger one is right across from it. The hallways are long windy and narrow, which again I thought was very cool because this was original. The rooms were smaller than normal hotel rooms you might get at the Marriott but once again this is an older hotel that has been remodeled. Furthermore, there is so much to do in Boston that we didn't waste any time in the room except to sleep and shower. The bathrooms were very clean and modern. I read several reviews about this hotel before we went and every one of them mentioned the size of the room but who cares? If I wanted to stay in a big room I would stay at home. The hotel staff was nothing but polite and helpful. The turndown service was great. If you want to get out and do things ask the hotel staff downstairs and they will point you in the right direction. There is room service in the hotel but if you don't want to spend that kind of money there is a grocery store right next door that had everything in it and it is open 24 hours a day. There is also a Walgreens a block away. We couldn't have picked a better location because it is smack dab in the middle of everything. You can still go to Fenway, or to the Harbour, and you can walk just about anywhere as well. There is a bar/club downstairs that is quite the happening place at night and a lot of reviews mentioned it being loud and the street noise being loud, but honestly I didn't notice. We went in the bar once but it was very pricey. Wine and beer was much cheaper at any restaurant in the area. **Sightseeing -- If you've never been to Boston and want to get a good tour take the Old Town Sightseeing Tour. (the orange and green trolley) When you walk out of the hotel go to your right and cross the street over to the Marriott Copley. There is a ticket booth in the lobby where you can buy the tickets to the trolley and they pick up every 10 mins at that location. The trolley takes you all over the city and tells you everything about it. The thing that I liked the most was you could get off at any one of the 15 stops and go off on your own and then come back to the stop and get back on. Another trolley shows up at every stop every 10 mins so no matter where you were you could back on any trolley throughout the day with your ticket. This was also a good way for us to get a ride over to Fenway when we went to the game that night. **Fenway -- If you're a baseball fan, and even if you're not this is a must! I'm a huge Red Sox fan, and my husband is a huge Yankees fan, so it was pertinent that we go to a RedSox/Yankees game. And it was amazing. Fenway is the oldest park in the country and there is so much history there.

This is so different from many large hotels where you check in and never see anyone unless you have a problem. I enjoyed their daily wine receptions in the lobby where various wines were served in beautiful stemware in a relaxing setting. This was just a nice feature. Nobody was trying to sell you cases of wine or anything like that. There were so many nice things about this hotel. There was free coffee in the lobby in the morning, a newspaper delivered during weekdays, turndown service in the evening with information left about the following day's weather and things to do in the city. Free bottled water was left in the evening, and the wifi worked very well in my room and in the lobby. The toiletries in the bathroom were of good quality and nicely scented - the kind you actually wanted to use and take home extras. Although there is a nightclub and popular bar on the ground floor, my room was perfectly silent for the whole week I was there. There was no noise whatsoever from music in the club or other guests, If you want a quiet room at this hotel, you can definitely have one. I didn't get to try the restaurant for dinner, although it looked attractive and welcoming. I did have a selection of appetizers and some wine for dinner one stormy night at their bar called \"Minibar\", and it was a really nice time. Minibar is a very trendy and popular place with the local people especially on the weekend. The room was very nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. The furniture was new and fine quality. The bathroom had a powerful shower with abundant hot water and bathtub. There were lots of big towels. Everything was extremely clean and fresh. I believe I had the minimum rate room, and some may consider it small compared to others they stayed in, but it was fine for me. There seem to be various other rooms available at higher prices that would probably be larger with views etc. This hotel is perfectly located in what is probably the best part of Boston.

I quickly went downstairs & paid the additional $$ to upgrade (first time I've ever been charged additional fees to upgrade - usually it's complimentary - & I doubt the hotel was full based on the lack of a crowd throughout stay). The second room worked - large enough. The location is the selling point of this hotel - 2 blocks from Newbury St., close to subway, restaurants, etc. Parking is a JOKE at $42 per night. You can park across the street at the Prudential center for $39 a night but good luck negotiating the maze of parking levels. Overall, the hotel is a good value if you book on Priceline.

When you arrive at Airport \"T\" station buy your ticket and catch the blue line to Government Center, the change to any green \"T\" to copley, catch any green line train except Lechmere and get off at copley.

Boat trips leave from here for harbour tours and the \"T\" ferry leaves for many destinations in boston harbour see the mbta website for a map.

For those of you who like to stock on bottled water, fruit, snacks etc, there is a shaws supermarket less than 2 blocks from the hotel, when you exit the hotel go right and walk in the direction of the Boston Duck tour stop and the prudential Center, Shaws is on the right, Its open 24 hours, and has a dunkin donuts inside for those of you when want your coffee and tosted bagel fix.

However the T is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it, with everything seeming to stop at Park Street (on Boston Common) and Government Centre (which is near the harbour and Quincy Market). Places we would reccommed visiting are Boston Common and the beautiful public garden with ponds and Swan Boats right next door; Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market; Boston Harbour (some really spectacular boats here!); Harvard Square and Cambridge and the New England Aquarium. Mainly, we followed the Freedom Trail as we were on foot - it's easy to find; a red line marked in the pavement starting at Boston Common - which takes you past many of the historic sites. If you like guided tours, there are a number of hop-on-hop-off trolley bus tours. There's also the Duck Tour (on a genuine WW2 landing craft) which looked a lot of fun as it takes you a trip on land and river! We didn't try this but tickets can be bought at the Prudential Centre and the Science Museum. I'm told that it's wise to book in advance as it's a popular tour. For dining out we tried Italian restaurant Pazzo's in Newbury Street, which is a couple streets away from the Copley Square hotel heading towards Boston Common- we found it in the 'places to go' magazine in our room. It's not the cheapest of restaurants however I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster ravioli. We also went to Solas, which is an Irish bar-restaurant on Boylston Street offering soups, sandwiches, burgers and stews at reasonable prices. Our favourite, however was Coogan's on Milk Street near Quincy Market. They dished up the best burger with all the trimmings of our trip along with excellent service! If you're looking for a place to have a beer then I would highly recommend the Sevens bar on Charles Street, Beacon Hill. It's a no frills 'local' bar which serves only beer and wine (it appears there are different licenses for serving spirits) where we were made to feel exceptionally welcome by staff and customers alike and had three great nights here. We left as Red Sox fans, with a better understanding of baseball!! A word of warning, however, when using taxis. On arrival we picked up a cab at South Station to the hotel which cost around $15 including tip. On our return journey, we were taken a rather 'scenic' route and were charged around $23 dollars. I did challenge the driver's route, however it's tricky when you're in a strange city and I guess some of the more unscrupulous rely on this. Obviously this isn't a phenomenon unique to Boston and didn't detract from our holiday but I would advise any fellow travellers to try and pick the route the driver takes if you can get your hands on a map before arrival. However, we loved Boston and would return again, and stay at the Copley Square without hesitation.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel that tries hard to please\u201d", "Author": "BostonboyMiami", "ReviewID": "UR36816834", "Content": "I stayed at the Copley Square hotel from Jul 29 to Aug 2 for a personal trip. I travel to Boston semi-regularly and this is the first time i stayed there because my usual hotel is booked solid. The reception and staff is very nice and accommodating. I called ahead before my arrival for a mini-fridge in the room and it was delivered after i checked in. They also helped me make dinner reservations. I do wish they can send the confirmation to me on the phone while i am out in the city not until i come back to the hotel later that night, but that is not a lapse on their part but mine for not asking it to be done. The room - i got a queen size boutique room - is small, charming and well equipped. My room has no view, but that's OK, since i am going to be be out of the room most of the time. The bed is very comfortable and i slept well throughout my trip. However, not everything is perfect. One day i woke up late and left the room in the afternoon with the \"please clean the room\" sign on the door. When i got back to the room that night the sign is still on the door and my room is still completely uncleaned. The bed wasn't made, the towels weren't replaced and the room looks like how i left it hours ago. To the front desk's credit, once i have called to tell them about the problem the housekeeping staff showed up within minutes and cleaned the room in record time. The front desk staff told me they would inform the manager about that lapse but i never got to have a word with him. I would imagine such oversight is uncommon and I would usually prefer to have the manager speak to me about it the next day. Another useful note about the hotel for other travelers is that the hotel bar is a popular place and it can get rather loud.

As others have mentioned the 24-hour grocery store Shaw's next door is very convenient. Two subway stops are just a short walking distance.

I've visited 16 countries in Europe over the past 2 years and this room is smaller than any room I've ever stayed in. In order to get into the bathroom, you have to press your back against the wall to get around the door. The bed is very comfortable and the blackout curtains keep the room completely dark. We found it very easy to sleep in, despite some street noise (our 6th floor room faces Exeter St.). We didn't try the hotel restaurant or bar but very much enjoyed the wine tasting from 5-6pm each night. My husband and I both liked the workout room, especially being able to watch TV while on a cardio machine.

I would love to keep this place my little secret home from home, but it really deserves to be shouted from the rooftops. The location is perfect, regardless of your interests. This truly is the heart of the action in Boston: for business, you can travel downtown by cab or by metro in just a few minutes, and once your work day is done, the last place you want to be is in the business district where everything shuts down at night, when all of the fun stuff is in the Back Bay area around the hotel. There is complimentary (real) high speed internet available via wifi: the speed or price of internet access is usually one of my key complaints about hotels (you either get zero speed and zero price or high speed for a high price), so this is very much appreciated. In bad weather, you can simply cross the street to the Prudential and Copley Malls, where you can stroll indoors around all of the high end fashion stores and, if the weather is nice, Newbury Street is around the corner, with more boutique shopping and cafes where you can sit and people-watch: this is the place where everyone comes to show themselves off in Boston. Some of the most popular tourist landmarks of Boston, such as the Hancock Tower, Copley Square, and the beautiful Boston Public Library as well as the huge Church of Christ, Scientist water display and the Boston Symphony Orchestra (Boston Pops) building are around the block, and the Boston Common and the beautiful Back Bay residential district are just a few minutes walk away. The Duck Tours (boats that drive around the city and then go on the Charles River which gives great views of the city) depart from one block away. That is in front of the Shaws Supermarket which is open 24 hours and makes for a convenient place to buy supplies (e.g., if you want to avoid the traditional $6 bottle of water in the room). If the weather is nice, I highly recommend walking down Newbury to Boston Common, then through the Common to the left (where you will find the famous Cheers Bar on Beacon Street), and then come back up Commonwealth Avenue to Mass Ave, and then back down Newbury Street again; it's a beautiful part of the city... the hotel puts a daily memo in your room with local events and a weather forecast that is usually accurate, so you can plan your days activities. If you want a really long walk or a jog/run, you can go up to Mass Ave bridge on Commonwealth to Mass Ave, then go across the Mass Ave bridge (as seen at the start of the movie \"21\") to MIT and then follow Memorial around to the Longfellow Bridge and back around through Charles Street and through the Common to Commonwealth again. The fitness center is equipped with free weights and running and cycling equipment if you get stuck in doors. The Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Common and most major landmarks of Boston are only a few minutes away whether the valet service arranges a limo or cab service or if you prefer to go around the corner to the underground metro network (the \"T\") and take a couple of stops. Cabs run only a few bucks from here to just about anywhere (if you want to visit Harvard, it will cost you about $15 and you can be there in ten minutes taking Storrow Drive). The T costs $2 anywhere you go on the subway network, and you can get multi-passes called the Charlie Card that make it easier to jump on and off (you have to take the green line to the red line to go to Harvard, so it can take you 40 minutes or more). If you arrange with at least a few hours notice, the staff can also get car service to pick you up or drop you off at the airport: pick up from the airport is more expensive, costing about 60 with tip, compared to about 30 by cab, but to the airport costs only 40, so almost the same as a cab. Boston, like Manhattan (or London), is not a car-friendly city: you're better off leaving it at home and taking a cab. However, if you drive in, you can valet your car at the hotel for about the same price as parking it yourself (not cheap at about $40). The food in the hotel restaurant Xhale is excellent, but I recommend going straight to the hotel bar, Minibar, where the food is also fantastic (the Kobe Mini Burgers are spectacular). Minibar is the hottest bar in town right now, the scene to be seen, particularly when the weather is nice and the terrace is open, and every time I go there the bar is buzzing with well dressed revelers and local celebrities keeping the place busy, even late into the night on the weekends. Both Minibar and Saint, the nightclub in the basement, always have a line outside, but you can skip that as a hotel guest. The decor in the hotel is plush and modern, with a tasteful mix of soft toned wallpaper and dark wood furniture in the rooms. This is an old building and the stair case is particularly beautiful. I have read some complaints about the bathrooms, and I have had mixed luck there: some bathrooms are huge, and every bathroom has a bath-shower so they're not that bad, but sometimes they can feel almost comically small compared to the generous proportions of the bedrooms, which are very big by comparison to many hotels: you can request a big bathroom in your reservation... I had better luck with Deluxe class room, if that helps. There are also enormous two bedroom suites: I managed to throw a reception for friends and associates before going to an event, which worked out extremely well. I also saw some complaints about the noise, so be aware that this is a city hotel: you can get rooms away from the bar and club at weekends if you prefer, but in general at night the area is really not very busy with traffic and I never had any problem sleeping, but if you are planning to sleep in during the day, be aware that this area is a hive of activity (see above). The greatest asset of this hotel, however, is definitely the staff, who have such an amazing attitude and are always ready and willing to go the extra mile to make sure you feel like royalty every time you visit. I have seen the General Manager personally at the front desk late in the evenings to welcome guests and make sure that everything is running smoothly, and the whole operation runs like clockwork. It is one of the most pleasant and genuine staff atmospheres I have ever encountered (I have been travelling around the world constantly for the last ten years and have stayed in some lovely places, so I don't say that lightly: this is the first hotel that has ever moved me enough to want to write a positive hotel review).", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cBest staff I've ever encountered\u201d", "Author": "defender4123", "ReviewID": "UR32200139", "Content": "This is a gem in Boston's Back Bay.

We were immediately greeted and arrived at noon, prior to check in. Our room wasn't ready yet, but we were told it would only be about an hour or so and they would call us when it was ready (which they did). We put in our reservation request on their website that we wanted a quiet room, away from the elevator and that is exactly what we got. They offered us a map and asked if we needed any directions or assistance. We booked the segway tour, Boston Gliders, (which I recommend; It is pricey, but you see a lot that the duck tours don't show you) and it was fun. A six year old was on the segway so anyone can do it. The only downside to our room was the tiny bathroom. It was shaped like a small triangle and it is true that only one person fits in it at a time, and has a stand up shower, no tub. Our family members had a room next to us and their bathroom was bigger, so just ask for a room with a bigger bathroom if you can't live with a tiny one. It took some getting use to for sure. The maid service was nice and they touch up your room in the evening if you don't have your do not disturb on your door. Also, the shampoo/conditioner/lotions were nice, a orange/ginger scent. The king bed was comfortable, nice down pillows, soft sheets, and I liked the bay window in our room. We did face Huntington st., but noise was not an issue at all. Other than that, the hotel was nice, updated, has flat panel tv's, free wine hour in the early evening, free coffee/hot chocolate throughout the day and the staff was very nice. No coke or vending machines and no spa. The bar/lounge there was very \"happening\" at night. I'm not sure if it was the holiday weekend or not, but it was busy with a lot of young people and club music. We went across the street to the Lenox for a drink there one night and the bar/lounge there was hip, too. I was surprised the bar was so modern since that is such an established hotel, but I liked it and it was bigger than Copley's bar. It wasn't a big deal getting a taxi, as they are just across the street, and even if you had to cross the street, it wasn't an issue and there was minimal traffic. From the airport to the hotel, a taxi was $26 prior to the tip for 2 people. When checking out at noon on Memorial Day, a rep from a car service met us outside of the hotel and asked if we would prefer a sedan over a taxi. He said he would give us a $35 to $40 rate. I told him the taxi was $26, and we agreed on $30. It was a nice, clean Lincoln town car and maybe took 10 minutes for us to get back to the airport (we took the HOV lane). Also, with the actual Copley sqare right around the corner, you are close to the subway, a ticket is $2 each way. Very easy access, but you do have to climb stairs. I also liked that there is a large, full-size grocery store right beside the hotel called Shaw's. I would stay again, as I got a great 2 week advanced purchase rate on the hotel's website, for $160 a night. I would just make sure to get a room with a bigger bathroom. Must eat at Pizzaria Regina in the North End (Little Italy). It has the best pizza and was great! We got there on a Sat. at 1:30 and maybe had to wait 10 minutes. It was SO worth it. Also, they take credit cards, most North End restaurants don't. Note: they do have this pizza in the food court area at Quincy Market, so if you can't make it to the restaurant, at least have a slice there! Also, if you like cannoli, you must have one from Modern Pastry Shop, again, about a 10 minute wait to get in, but so worth it and they fill the cannoli's after you order it so it is the freshest, even over Mike's Bakery. We also went to Fenway for a game and walked there. A lot of people do so if you get directions and can't remember them all, just follow the numerous people that walk to the game. It is about a mile from the hotel. Not a bad walk at all.

When the club let out early Monday morning, we were startled awake from the loud, obnoxious people outside. There was no soundproofing in the windows, so we heard everything. We heard the screaming, a fight that broke out, drunk people yelling, extremely loud bass from a car that rattled our room, and when the police arrived. The police presence did little to calm the crowd down, with drunk people yelling at the police. I would have liked the staff to be a bit more apologetic than they were. I also would have appreciated some sort of discount for the room, since I was kept up for about an hour and a half while these issues took place. My likelihood to stay at this hotel would be low. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends or colleagues based upon our experience. Soundproof windows are a must, especially in a hotel that sells itself as being upscale. Needless to say, I was disappointed.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location at a reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "Zinnflylla", "ReviewID": "UR30806543", "Content": "The good: - Location, location, location. In terms of seeing tourist sites, it can't be beat. It's an easy walk from the hotel to the South End and the Back Bay. The Copley T station is about a block away if you're interested in traveling farther afield. - Service. When we showed up at around 10am and asked if an early check-in could be arranged, the gentleman working at the front desk immediately ran up to our room to check if it was ready. We were very grateful that the hotel was able to accommodate this request. The folks working at the front desk couldn't be nicer or more attuned to the needs of the guests. - Peace and Quiet. Several other guests have noted that their rooms were loud. Ours wasn't, possibly because it faced another wall of the hotel. Also, having read other reviews, I was ready for the pillows and bedding to be uncomfy. They weren't. We had no complaints about the comfort of the bed or pillows. The Not-So-Good - Housekeeping. Our towels weren't fully replenished during our stay (despite our obeying the instruction to put used towels on the floor). Shampoo and conditioner wasn't replenished either, which meant that nobody in our room could wash hair on the last day as we rushed to get to the airport. Bottom line - be ready to ask housekeeping for additional needed supplies. - View. We reserved our room for a great rate through a third-party discounter, so it's likely that we were assigned one of the hotel's lesser views. We looked right at another wing of the hotel, and the room got very little natural light throughout the day.

Given our two night stay, I think it falls short primarily for two reasons, noise level and issues with comfort. It does, however, outshine many other hotels as far as personable employees and making a solid impression in letting the customer know that the staff is more than willing to provide all they can to make ones stay as enjoyable as possible. Because of that, I give the hotel a solid A+ for their focus and dedication in trying to provide their customers with the best possible service and experience. The hotel although very tastefully refurbished, is still an old hotel. We stayed in Room 511, a king suite (and do agree with the previous reviewer's complaint regarding the uncomfortableness of the pillows!!). Suite was well appointed, no doubt about it, and roomy, too. But for us the catch was the noise factor. The street noise is UNBELIEVABLE through out the night into the wee hours of the morning -- from the constant sounds of irrate horns blowing, sirens wailing, the after hours bar crowd laughing and yelling, etc. - it is definitely over the top. Not sure if it was due to old walls, windows or what. We have stayed directly across the street numerous times at the Marriot, and this has never been a problem there. Another pet peeve was the inability to get the room temp to our satisfaction -- the bed is equiped with a sheet and a duvet -- so you find you are either too hot or too cold. I hate sleeping with just a sheet on, but that's what I ended up doing. Given just how pricey the hotel actually is, these two issues were deal breakers for us. On the positive side, the location is really phenomenal. If you are someone who can sleep through just about anything and are not picky about the comfort of the bed and pillows that you sleep on, then I say, have at it.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nursemelis374", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "nursemelis374", "ReviewID": "UR29865678", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights in early April and absolutely loved it!

The park is walking distance. I think the marketplace area is more interesting. However, we had a good rate on the room and I think it is simply better to just take a couple of cabs if needed.

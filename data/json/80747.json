Did hear the cable cars a bit (we were on the \"outside\", but not on the street side), but didn't bother us. TV great, chair lacked supportive padding. In room coffee great, room service and minibar prices borderline outrageous (no nearby cafe's or breakfast spots that we noticed). Shower water pressure weak, and shower head low.

Reception is always friendly as were all staff members we encountered. Breakfast was quite good although there are numerous, fabulous restaurants every where you turn so I'd recommend dining out. Back to the room - the beds were very comfortable, clean and lots of pillows. The bathroom had a sliding door and separate toilet/shower room. Long vanity and sink area with hanging space at the end - it worked well for two people.The location is really perfect since you walk out of the hotel and turn right a few steps to one of the main line cable cars. Or, you can simply walk down to the wharf - a great walk and leads you right to an incredible farmer's market. Take the cable car back up the hill or a cab.

Being a light sleeper and someone who has trouble falling asleep with noise, I was a little anxious about the reviews that mentioned noise. I called the hotel directly to ask for a quiet room and then later called to make sure they had noted that request. We were not disappointed; a room on the inside facing the courtyard was perfect for us, and both my husband and I slept better in this hotel than we have anywhere else. NOTE: If you are facing the streets - even the non-cable car streets - you WILL hear a ton of street noise, including the incredibly loud cable cars and taxi summoning whistles. It's just a busy spot. The rooms, although small, are very nicely appointed with an extremely comfortable bed and even windows that open for some fresh air. The number one positive about this hotel, though, is the service. The attitudes of the employees at this hotel are wonderful and welcoming. The front door is opened every time you approach it, you are greeted warmly by every employee, and any request is filled almost instantly. On top of the incredibly welcoming atmosphere, the location makes Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and many other spots very walkable (just get ready for the hills). For dinner one night we walked about two blocks to the Nob Hill Cafe, which is a tiny neighborhood spot serving mostly Italian dishes. The food was fine, but nothing to rave about. Other nights we walked down into North Beach, which is only about a 15 minute walk. We did not try the hotel restaurant, but there were many options within a few minutes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Beyond the antiquated decor and carpeting throughout the hotel, and the fact that the amenities were limited to shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, I didn't expect the following: - whitish stains on the chair and the work area (let your mind wander, mine did) - yellow stains on the roof of the bathroom above the shower - hairs stuck on the bathroom ceiling and walls - minibar was broken with no ETA for a fix (\"they will get to it sometime soon\") To me this says laziness.

I'm basing my assessment on location, amenities and room comfort but it was the little things more than anything else that made this such a wonderful experience. Firstly, the location. It's set at the top of Powell on the corner of California. You're steps away from Union Square, Chinatown, Pacific Heights, you name it. You can walk practically anywhere. And if you don't feel like hoofing it up the hill you can catch any one of the streetcars that ramble up from below. (Personally, I like walking up the hills as it's great for burning off various meals partaken of in Chinatown or SOMA.) Amazing restaurants within a five-block-radius. There's even a little liquor/food store just down the street on Powell that has wine and cheese and fruit and other sundry items (I picked up water and nuts and wine) so you don't have to crack into the minibar. Secondly, the amenities. From the gorgeous bar/restaurant to the comfortable lounge to the well-appointed rooms, this hotel delivers the goods. The bar was a great place to relax at the end of the day. With excellent wine selections from local wineries and delicious freshly-made cocktails as well as great bar snacks, I found myself ending up there by choice every evening. The restaurant was also fantastic -- and the same food delivered to your room was so far from typical room service fare that I elected to order in at least twice while I was there. The gym was great and rarely full (I didn't go during heavy activity times, yes, but still). Thirdly, the room comfort. Every aspect of these rooms are lovely. I stayed there twice in the same week but several days apart due to my travel schedule. The first two nights I was in a 7th floor room on California. Great views of the bay and street below. The bed is unreal. Like sleeping in a pillow. I asked for extra down pillows and they were waiting for me when I arrived. There are Aveda products in the bathroom and a fabulous shower. Slept like a baby. On the second stay, I was on the 4th floor over Powell. Beautiful bay windows and a nice view. Yes, the noise from the streetcars is terrible. But I knew that going in -- I wanted the view and that comes with a price. If you want the same comfort but a quieter stay, request a room on the inside. No view but infinitely quieter. Or you can do what I did and bring earplugs and a white noise app for your phone :). But really, it was the small touches that make me want to come back -- like the doorman remembering me whenever I returned and the front desk staff bringing water to waiting patrons and the bartenders remembering which wine I liked (the Napa Groth -- and this was only after having visited the bar twice!) and the general friendliness of every single staff member. The entire package made it a memorable stay. One that I'd love to repeat any time I'm in San Francisco! One negative note: WiFi is not free in the rooms. It's $14.95/24 hours. As a luxury/business hotel, Internet should absolutely be free -- if we're spending time in the city and in our rooms doing business, we shouldn't have to pay for internet every night.

Over the years, I have stayed at the other two Nob Hill \"grande dame\" hotels -- the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins, and I would include the Stanford Court in the same category. When I arrived, I was offered a queen room with a \"better view\" than the king room that had been set aside for me. I assumed that this was a win-win, but as it turned out, it was a mixed blessing. True, the room I ended up with had very nice views, and I assume that the room that I had been given was an interior room with no views at all, but the views came at a cost. The Stanford Court faces Powell Street, which is the one that the two of the three cable cars run on. The room they gave me was right over the Powell Street side, and on a lower floor (3rd), so the cable cars going by, ringing their bells at every stop, were quite noticeable during their operating hours. For a city dweller, this was a minor annoyance, but for someone from more quiet surroundings might find this rather disturbing. Just a word of caution. Otherwise, the room was very well furnished, with a very firm and comfortable bed, a large flat-screen TV and a writing desk and small chair and table. The room was small but not claustrophobic, and the bathroom/closet was laid out intelligently, allowing for two guests to be using different parts of the layout in succession. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. I was even able to save a little time and effort by purchasing my Transit Pass from the front desk, rather than from the Muni booth. I will also caution those who choose to avail themselves of the valet parking at the hotel. While it was very convenient, I found that calling ahead for the car was not always successful. Most likely, the attendants were constantly out, moving the cars in and out, and were not there to answer the calls, so more often than not, I just had to head down and call for the car from the doorman and wait. Personally, I prefer Nob Hill as a central location for stays in SF, and in that sense, the Stanford Court certainly fit the bill. Other than my concern over the street noise, I would definitely recommend the Stanford Court and would stay there again on future trips to SF.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cRecovery from Napa wine tasting\u201d", "Author": "brownman6", "ReviewID": "UR118285031", "Content": "Our two night stay on top floor of Stanford Court was a welcome respite from the hectic pace of two a day tastings in the Napa Valley.

We were also traveling with 2 teenagers (13 and 14), so we needed to satisfy the teenage quotient as well. Our stay in San Francisco at the Stanford Court met all of my expectations. Our \"California Adventure\" started by landing in SF, picking up a car and proceeding to Yosemite, then heading to Monterey and finally ending in SF. We decided to spend 4 days in the city and I wanted a good central location to call \"Home.\" I was initially concerned about location. I wanted to be in a good neighborhood, near to transportation and close to the things that I wanted to do. I was dropping off my rental car after we arrived as I did not want the expense of paying the extremely expensive rates to park a car. I looked at lots of Trip Advisors and settled in on the Stanford. This location is tough to beat. It sit on Top of Nob Hill, has a cable car stop for 2 different lines right in front of the hotel and if you are so inclined, is a close walk to China Town as well as Union Square (it's easier to catch the cable car though). Since we were traveling as a family of 4, we needed a room with 2 beds. I knew that the Stanford offered rooms with 2 queen beds, so I made this request on our reservation. I called a day prior to our arrival to ensure that we would have a 2 queen bed room. When we arrived, we were assigned an Inside room with 2 queen beds. My kids were uncertain if an inside room was for them, but after seeing the room, they were fine. Our inside room was quite spacious, had 2 windows which overlooked an inside courtyard, 2 large chairs, a desk and our room had a separate bathroom and sink area that was closed off with a door. In this same area, we had ample storage room for a couple of suitcases and all of our hanging clothes. This is an older hotel hat has been recently renovated with modern accommodations. This is not an old and worn hotel. The property has character and is well maintained. Basically, the Stanford fit us very well. Our room was very clean, which is a critical point, and we had no complains with any of the hotel services. Each hotel staff member that we encountered was pleasant and said hello. We even got to know a few on a first name basis. The Bell Staff was pleasant and helpful with directions. The Concierge Staff offered excellent choices for dinner. The Front Desk Staff was efficient and professional. Our 4 day stay in the city was enjoyable by all standards. A few personal recommendations regarding San Francisco: I see no need to drive a car in the city. I am glad that I did not have the worry of a car as driving the hills is an adventure and parking could be problematic. Looking down any of the hills in the city will immediately confirm that a car is not necessary. I would highly recommend purchasing a 3 day cable car/bus/trolley/subway (not Bart) pass from the front desk (I believe $18 for 3 days) - yes, the front desk sells these passes. The cable car stop is directly in front of the hotel, so it is extremely convenient. I believe that a single ride on the cable car is $6 as well, so this pass is a real bargain. Having the added bus and subway pass also helped in getting around the city. We started our first day in the city by taking a guided tour bus of the city. We picked up the tour in Union Square and the bus drives a loop through, and stops at, all of the well-known San Francisco landmarks - Fisherman's Wharf, Presido (Disney museum), Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Haight-Asbury, Painted Ladies, Financial District, etc. The Hotel Concierge made recommendations on which tour company to take (it was not a Gray Line Tour). Our tour served as a good introduction to the city and gave us an idea of what we wanted to see and of where we wanted to go. Union Square is several block down the hill and offers a wide array of upscale shopping and restaurant choices. There's a Starbucks on the corner between Union Square and the hotel that offers a good array of breakfast choices and drinks. There's also a CVS Drugstore right across the street from Starbucks to load up on any snacks too. This area was very active, and safe, into the early evening with lots of stores remaining open and people walking about. Chinatown is 2 blocks down the hill (in the other direction) and offers some fun cheap shopping and dining options (the Concierge was able to recommend an excellent Chinese restaurant). We felt completely safe in Chinatown even after dark as there are lots of people walking the streets. Fisherman's Wharf is no more than 10 minutes on the cable car down the hill. I am personally glad that I did not make the choice to stay down in the Fisherman's Wharf area - it's a great place to spend a couple of hours, but the vibe is the area is not as pleasant as in Nob Hill, or at the Stanford. While at Fisherman's Wharf, stop to see the sea lions on the pier as well as make time for some Boudin Sourdough at their Bread factory (go to their factory along Fisherman's Wharf and not just to a Boudin Bread Store). You can get a decent lunch there as well. Definitely take in the Alcatraz Tour and order your tickets as far in advance as you can from alcatrazcruises.com (they are the only vendor to and from the island, so there is no need to shop prices). I saw people being turned away at the dock who expected to walk up to purchase a ticket. Ghiradelli Square is close to FW, but not worth a special trip unless you have time to spend. The Ghiradelli Chocolate store is there and they provide a free sample of their chocolate, but overall, the store is quite small, crowded and expensive. It's also not a good place to try to catch a cable car as the lines are very long. if you have the time and are a sports fan, I would strongly recommend catching a Giant baseball game. We attended an afternoon game and AT&T Park is beautiful. I highly advise that you obtain tickets prior to getting to SF as good seats are difficult to come by and can be expensive. I arranged for tickets several weeks prior to our arrival and I was surprised on how difficult a good ticket, at any price, was to obtain. Overall, San Francisco is a wonderful touring city and The Stanford Court was an excellent hotel choice. The hotel receives my high marks for comfort and service. I think what's best about The Stanford Court is its location; this hotel a real hidden gem.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, TOP of the hill\u201d", "Author": "t_rose72", "ReviewID": "UR118037180", "Content": "This hotel has great rooms that are up to date.

Internet is also not thrown in as an amenity so that was an additional $14.95/night. Even that was spotty, kicking us off for quite a long time during a crucial telephone call.

When we walked through Chinatown earlier in the week, we were not sure which restaurants were mid$$$ or low$$$ becasue all of the information was in Chinese. In addition, a lot of restaurants in Chinatown do not have English menus, just pictures of the food and for me with pork allergies, I needed to know if I was going to eat chicken or pork.

The staff was very friendly. All things that I look for when booking a hotel. I will definitely stay there again. It is the perfect location for staying in San Fran. I learned a lesson however- and will have to keep this in mind on my next visit. When booking your room at this turely awesome hotel, don't request a city view. If you must have the city view, make sure it does not look down on California Street. The cable cars are on this side of the hotel, and while this is a fabulous tourist attraction- it is not as desireable when you are trying to sleep. We got very little sleep. The best bet would be to request a courtyard view. The courtyard is a nice feature at this hotel. When you arrive at the hotel, the vehicle can drive into the courtyard and you don't have to deal with your luggage street-side. This was a plus for me. We were suprised by the lack of quality of the towels in the room. For such a luxury room, the towels were comparable to that of a Holiday Inn. Like I said- lots of pros, very few cons.

We also were right down the hall from the ice machine and the fitness center. No Worries - there was basically no noise at all for all four of our nights there, we loved that. The room was very big with two double beds, two lounge chairs, a desk and chair, a room safe and an open closet in the bath area, which we liked. The shower was fantastic, as were the heated towel bars. We had room service one evening as I did not feel too well, the soup and appetizer came in around 10 minutes. Also, we had an issue with the sound going out on the flat screen TV, the hotel engineer was there in minutes and swapped out the TV in minutes as well - something to be said for being on a low floor.

If you have a car (you don't need one in SF) it is very expensive to park (valet parking is $50 pn).

I flew into SFO, stayed for 2 nights, before electing to drive down Highway 1 to Santa Barbara for the conference. I should stress that I stay in many 4* and 5* hotels for business all the time, so am able to compare and contrast a lot of hotels of this calibre. I landed at about midday, picked up the hire car and drove to the hotel. I probably arrived about 2.30pm or so. Overall I had now been travelling for about 24 hours (I live in Singapore). The valet parking was straightforward and pleasant enough. However at the check in, I was informed no rooms were available, and would only be available at 3pm. I gave my mobile number and they said they would call the moment teh room became available. I stepped into the bar for a beer. By 3pm, no phone call, so I went to the desk again to finally get my room. Still no room was available (so fair enough on the non-existent phone call I guess), so went for another beer and went back to the desk at 3.30pm as there still hadnt been a call. This time there was a room. Great - but why no phone call to tell me? The room was a disabled-friendly room (not disclosed to me at the front desk) at the end of a long corridor. This was not a big issue as disabled-friendly rooms are generally more spacious. The bed was very comfortable, the room very clean, the TV had a great selection of channels and the bathroom was pretty large as well. All as expected I would have said. However, the big problem came when having to use the bathroom. As I stated the bathroom was very spacious (presumably so a wheelchair would be able to move around in it). The sink and lavatory were fine - but the shower had some big problems in my view. This is a bit hard to decribe so bear with me. The shower head was fixed in a position in the corner of the stall, and I just couldn't move the direction it was pointing in at all. I could adjust the height ok, but not the direction. The problem was it was pointing directly down onto a foldable seat that the stall had (again presumably for a wheelchair user to use when washing). Not being disabled however, I just couldn't get into a position between the foldable seat and the unmovable direction of the showerhead where the weater actually landed on me in an effective manner. This wasnt helped by the fact that the water pressure was terrible, which meant that the stream of water simply didn't direct outwards in any way at all. Don't get me wrong here, I think its great to have disabled-friendly rooms in hotels. I truly do. However if you are going to double them up for use by able-bodied individuals, then you need to make sure the able-bodied individual can actually use the room in a standard manner. Essentially, it was so poor, that I had no choice but to take the shower head off and hold it above my head. That might be ok in a 2* room at $50 a night - but not in a hotel of this quality and price. The hotel is excellently situated and the service (other than that irritating check in process) was actually pretty good. I also didn't experience any of the traffic noise that others mention, but then my view was of a brick wall opposite the hotel, so I assume I was at the back. The real problem with this place is that nothing in particular was special, and the shower was truly awful, which really did detract from my enjoyment of what should have been a great stay. I am going to recommend this hotel I guess, but I would insist at check in or reservation time that you do not stay in a disabled-friendly room, unless of course, you are disabled.

I called FedEx and they said that they already tack on a fee ($8 total for our 2 packages) and under no circumstance to pay an additional $10 to the hotel. If you have stuff to ship, you're better off just walking down the street to the FedEx location yourself. It would have been $18 extra to ship our package through the hotel, which to me is outrageous. Other than that, the hotel is in a great location, but that's about it. We needed a taxi for the airport on our last day and the concierge harassed us every single time we passed by his desk about booking a town car instead. It got so annoying that we would intentionally avoid walking by him since we had no interest in booking a town car when the taxi suited us perfectly and was $20 cheaper.

Unfortunately, we arrived around midnight on a Friday night (after a very long flight from the East Coast) to be told that our reservation for 2 beds was \"only a request\" and the desk clerk then directed us to a handicapped accessible room on a low floor, no view, with a queen bed that turned out to have literally no space for a roll away. When we called the desk from the room and said that if we put a roll away in the room, someone would have to step onto the rollaway bed in order to get to the bathroom, the desk clerk tried to tell us that all of the rooms were the same size --and he said no other larger rooms were available in the entire hotel. When we pushed back and said we'd stayed there before (and knew there were larger rooms), he told us he'd call us back--and yet left us hanging in the room, with our luggage and the somewhat embarrassed bell staff for 15 minutes of awkward conversation. Eventually, since it was now about 12:45 am and our child was exhausted, we called back and he found us a room, which, big surprise, was on a high floor, had a good view, included a king bed and had sufficient space for a rollaway bed. Very disheartening to be told first that no such rooms existed--only to be given one roughly 45 minutes later after arguing...The room was a bit dirty (there were loose hairs on the floor and someone's receipt was still sitting on a chair), but it was fine. Given that it was a weekend, the hotel was very busy, the concierge seemed overwhelmed (we had to ask twice to get all of the information that we needed) and in the end, the staff seemed intent on just getting through the barrage of guests until the weekend was over...Indeed on Saturday, the maid literally did not come to clean the room until 5:30 pm.

The location near Union Square is outstanding. There is a great playground nearby (and another in Chinatown, just a few blocks away). And the views are great.

The hotel driveway features a beautiful stained glass dome and a lounge for waiting for tours/cabs etc- a great idea which more hotels should adapt.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cTotally Improved and Great Rate + View\u201d", "Author": "ECMedbooks", "ReviewID": "UR75625039", "Content": "I recently stayed at Stanford Court for a conference which was held at the Mark Hopkins International next door.

Our room looked modern and upgraded (flat screen TV, with multiple A/V outlets, two phones, towel heater, flexible shower head). We had a room with a view of the bay which was amazing. There is free WiFi in the lobby which was fast. The operator was very helpful with any issues and courteous as well. The location of course is amazing, Chinatown and Union Square are within walking distance (though you have a steep hill to go down on and then up later) as well as the Ferry Building. All in all I was really pleased with my stay. Only negatives would be. There bath towels are really cheap feeling and could use an upgrade to match the hotel upgrade. There is no fridge that you can use in the room - though they will bring you one very quickly if you want - still slight inconvenience. And just make sure you don't touch the mini-bar because its weighted sensors (wasn't really marked clearly that was the case), but we didn't have an issue with this. Oh!

This was our last night of our road trip from Southern California up to Oregon and back. We found a great deal for a room in at this hotel and saw that it had good reviews and was in a decent part of town (right next to the Mark Hopkins, close enough we could have used their wireless internet had it been free). When we arrived at the hotel we were pleasantly greeted by the Valet who promptly removed out luggage from the car and gave us a stub for car retrieval. We walked through the large glass doors into the lobby and we invited into a large room with marble floors, granite counter tops and smiles on the employees faces. We gave them out last name and they began to check up in to their system, all was going well until they saw that we were not paying the full price for the room but rather had gotten a discounted rate through another site. Then the mood changed. We were not offered assistance up to our room by a bellman, we were pointed in the direction of the elevators and given the top floor with the room farthest from the elevator. When the person at the desk handed me our keys I had noticed she had written our room number on the envelope, standard practice, but I also noted that she wrote how much we paid for the room on the same side of the envelope. Why? So everyone would know that I am a saver and refuse to pay full price for a room in a town that is already overpriced? Regardless, my wife and I made our way to our room which seemed to be small for the money paid . A queen bed, 2 night stands, desk and office chair, table for 1, arm chair, and an over sized entertainment center/mini bar, all in a room that was about 14'x14'. At least the TV was big enough to see from the bed, probably 40\"-42\". The bathroom was nice, although really only enough room for one, and the water pressure was very unstable, but nice. That night my wife and I had tickets to see Wicked (an absolutely amazing production, see it if you haven't), so while the wife was getting ready I decided to watch some TV. Turned it on and got the typical hotel channel, flipped through some HD channels and thought, oh this is nice, it will be just like home ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, all the other wonderful HD channels, again, let down. Only 4 HD channels, none of the others worked, few of the other \"analog\" channels worked. No HBO, no HBO HD. All I could think was, here I am in a rather pricey 4 star hotel with a valet, and I can't watch have the channels I watched last night in another hotel that cost half as much and the room was twice as big. So I decided I'll just go online and watch some shows Hulu or something. I open our laptop, connect to the local wireless and up comes a message, \"In order to use the wireless internet you must purchase a 24 hour business pass for $15.95.\" Excuse me? I'm paying $50 a night for parking, plus the cost of my room, and now you want me to pay another $15.95 to use the internet. I don't think so, I stayed at a Best Western and got free wireless and paid 1/3 of what I'm paying you. Needless to say, I will not be staying at this hotel ever again. I will probably not be returning to SF anytime soon either, it's not clean, I didn't feel safe walking around town in broad daylight, and the cost of an over night stay is ludicrous.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cfantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "chrstphrwarwick", "ReviewID": "UR71763120", "Content": "stayed 3 nights at stanford court in san francisco fantastic hotel great staff good location", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect price for comfort, luxury, awesome location and great service.\u201d", "Author": "loopysis", "ReviewID": "UR71208449", "Content": "My daughter's 16th birthday gift was a trip to San Francisco to see Idina Menzel sing with the San Francisco Symphony. As is my modus operandi I immediately went to upromise.com to click on priceline.com (because priceline.com gives you 2% back for college with every transaction) to purchase a hotel room. I wasn't too familiar with San Francisco so I took a \"nearest to symphony\" approach. I chose Nob Hill area, 4 star hotel and, as is my way, tried $88/night. I was delighted to find that priceline had accepted my request. We left in early July for a 4 day trip to San Francisco. We arrived early at the hotel and the front desk worked at getting rooms next to each other (not an option on the priceline site). They told us they'd call us when our rooms were ready and we went out for our journey. The hotel has a great big interactive touch screen map where you can find restaurants, tourist destinations, etc so we chose a restaurant a few blocks away. Sadly, the restaurant was closed and we were a tad disappointed as we continued our stroll in search of a restaurant. Within minutes we found ourselves in Chinatown. AWESOME. Had no idea Chinatown and Nob Hill were so close to each other! Had no idea Nob Hill is so close to everything. We came back to the hotel and the valet was always Johnny on the Spot in getting our doors opened and us on our way to our room. Please note - in retrospect I would never rent a car again in San Francisco. It was convenient to be able to drive to/from the airport...but there is no real need for a car. The driving is insane, the available transportation is varied and quite available and, get this...the parking at the hotel was FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. Plus the tips for the valet. Plus the cost of a rental car. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. And very unnecessary. The elevators are close to the front desk and the rooms are wonderful. They are very large and roomy with great oversized chairs for watching the gorgeous flat screen tele. I usually don't sleep well in hotel beds but I slept like a log in these incredibly comfy beds. The bathrooms were nice but I'm always disappointed that a 4 star hotel can't have a bigger bathtub. Maybe that's just me. They use yummy Aveda products (which we pilfered) and their coffeemaker made quite a decent cup of coffee. The last night we ordered room service and the food was delicious. A must see if you are staying on Nob Hill -- regardless of our religious persuasion -- check out the Grace Cathedral. It's mammoth and truly jaw dropping. There is some good mojo in that church...and if you go in, why don't you light a candle and pray for your family, your country, the earth. ;) All in all, this hotel comes highly recommended.

I was very impressed with the property -- in a city where most of the major chain properties are very big hotels, this property offered the benefits of a chain with the charm of a smaller, boutique property. From seeing into various rooms during housekeeping, it appears that the rooms at this property can vary in size and layout, as is often the case at historic properties. Half of the rooms face an interior courtyard, and half face the streets of San Francisco. I hit it lucky with my room -- my windows faced Powell Street, and I had a fantastic view of the city. This is certainly an advantage of the hotel's location atop Nob Hill! Although I could hear the cable cars in my room, the noise from the street did not negatively affect my sleep. My room was good-sized; it had a queen bed (most of the beds here appear to be queens, not kings -- fine by me, but maybe problematic for some), a nice sitting area, a desk, and a large bathroom. Everything was in great condition; the hotel had clearly recently undergone major renovation. I thought the room had a great color scheme (creams and golds) and stylish decor. The renovation did a good job of allowing the property to keep its historic charm while giving it a modern look. The room also had great conveniences for a business traveler: lots of outlets, including by the bed; reading lights built into the headboard, etc. I LOVED the bed. It is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in. Truly wonderful -- soft sheets, padded mattress, warm and cozy...hard to get out of! I wish this hotel would share its bed-making secrets with other properties around the country. I had access to the concierge lounge. It was oustanding -- a good-sized breakfast in the morning, appetizers in the evening, and a dessert collection late-night, along with drinks. The lounge space was large and the service was warm and friendly. The lounge also offers great views of San Francisco. I thought the hotel's service hit the mark. My check-in was quick and efficient. The bellmen consistently opened the doors as I came and went from the hotel. When I needed a car to the airport at an obscenely early hour, the concierge arranged one for me. The hotel's location is great for getting around San Francisco -- it's a short walk down to Chinatown and on to North Beach, a short walk down to the financial district, a short walk down to Union Square -- I really enjoyed the easy access to various parts of the city. Notice one thing, though -- all of those places are DOWN from the hotel. That means that you have to go back UP to get back to the hotel -- and San Francisco's hills will give you a workout! No complaints...just bring your walking shoes. If I had to offer any criticisms, it might be a small-ish lobby -- it was in essence a front desk, concierge desk, and elevators, with a restaurant off to the side that had a pretty open feel. The hotel's elevators could also be very slow, particularly during busy hours. Very small things in the scheme of things. Highly impressive property. And, best of all, very affordable!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, Washington", "Title": "\u201cIdeally located for most points in the city\u201d", "Author": "Generic90", "ReviewID": "UR69164498", "Content": "I stayed at this property while spending the Memorial Day weekend visiting family in San Francisco. This was my first stay at this hotel; I selected it based on rate and on previous experience with Marriott properties. There is a historic kind of feel to the hotel that makes it feel unique in comparison to standard stays. However, once you step inside, there is a modern/contemporary vibe that provides a nice balance. It appears the lobby and surrounding area has recently been renovated; the full-size, touch-screen, interactive maps were very handy. Customer service is very important to me, and throughout the duration of my stay was outstanding. Everyone - valets, concierge, bartenders, housekeepers, and front desk staff - were always polite and friendly, and responsive to all guests. I got the feeling that if I had a problem, it would be dealt with promptly. A particular note on customer service had to do with the newspaper delivery, which I have as a request as a Marriott Rewards member. Per my profile request, I received a Wall Street Journal at my door on the Saturday of my stay. On the Sunday and Monday, I received copies of the San Francisco Chronicle in lieu of the WSJ non-publication days, with a handwritten note attached to the paper indicating that they hoped the \"replacement\" paper was not an inconvenience (it certainly wasn't). I have been to other Marriott properties where such a \"replacement\" was not provided - though I do not demand it - so it was a nice, unexpected touch. The room I had was on the 6th floor right near the corner of California and Powell Streets. From a pure tourist perspective, this was a wonderful location, as all the cable car lines intersected there. There was some ambient street noise, but the loudest of it - and it wasn't very loud at all - was the rumble of the cable cars and their bells as they passed by the hotel. It was a very pleasant sound, and at night it was very quiet. The windows were somewhat small, but provided wonderful vistas of the Bay, the Financial District, and to the area around the Giants ballpark. As for the room itself, it was well appointed. The carpet - as in the hallway - looked to be close to ready for replacement, but it was clean. The bed was exceedingly comfortable and provided excellent rest. The workstation was functional, and there were no issues with the Internet connection. The bathroom and adjacent dressing area was very spacious. The only real point of contention in the room was the \"modern\" furniture - including a very uncomfortable chair. I wound up either laying on the bed or sitting on the more comfortable desk chair to watch TV or read. Guests of this property would be well-advised to check with the concierge or front desk staff to obtain a 3-day Muni \"passport\". This provides unlimited riding on all San Francisco public transit - including the cable cars - for a flat $20. Not only is this a few dollars less expensive than getting it at a Muni station or buying single-ride fares, it is very convenient to pick up before you head out for your travels. In terms of location, the hotel could not be much better. This starts with the cable cars, as all three lines intersect at the hotel. From a pure \"strategic\" standpoint, this is a perfect place to start a ride from, as the cable cars can be harder to board at the terminus points. Starting from here, it is a quick journey in any direction - whether it be to Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, the Presidio, or any of the other many interesting and fun places to visit in the city.

I have found the most quiet, elegant, service orientated hotel in San Francisco---a city known for its upscale hotels. I highly recommend the Renaissance Stanford Court hotel for the following reasons: 1) Breakfast. Why schlep out to start your day--only to stand in line the popular breakfast spots around town when the hotel's restaurant serves carafes of coffee and these wunderbar heavenly light, fluffy lemon souffle pancakes, drizzled with raspberry sauce. My waiter, Ramon is a true professional. He is not over or under you. He knows when to serve and clear. I wouls say service that is personable and professional. Oh, by the way. order the carrot juice. It's a change from blah, blah orange juice. Reason # 2 for loving this hotel----the sound of cable cars while lying in my bed at night. Pure romanticism. The beds are uber large with crisp, snow white clean linens. Reason #3) Mr. Chin. He is stationed in the lobby to assist in any way. His is a kind, gentle man.The Renaissance Stanford Court Hotel is a total, hands-on, service orientated hotel situated in a great location---at the crest of Nob Hill, on California Street. I walked to Grace Cathederal for their Sunday service. Inspirational.

Every single employee we encountered made us feel welcome. The location is central. Cable cars or taxis will take you anywhere in the city within minutes, and Union Square and Chinatown are only a few blocks away. However, being near the top of Nob Hill makes it more difficult to walk places, especially to walk _back_ to the hotel. For us it was an acceptable trade-off for the convenient location and wonderful views of the city. The cable car noise is ubiquitous in the city-view rooms even at the highest floors, and the windows are not completely soundproof. On the other hand, the cars do not run from ~midnight to ~6. The room and bathroom were very clean, as were the windows and common areas. Bathroom amenities were Aveda. There was very little room to room or hallway noise. The rooms have been redone recently. (Let's hope that the jarring yellow carpet in the hallway is still something to be replaced, and was not installed as part of the renovation. See the photo that another reviewer posted.) The intent may be to mimic a W Hotel, but in the end, this is a still a Marriott and it never reaches the hip and edgy feel of the W's. Some of the 1970's retro furnishings (arm chairs, lamps) are going to seem old in a year or two. Overall, though, the rooms are attractive and comfortable, if a little on the small side. There are no Marriott brand markings anywhere in the hotel, but (in addition to the Book of Mormon in the bedside table) you know where you are. First are the thin scratchy towels that Marriott has in nearly all its properties, even the high-end ones; and these were particularly disappointing -- even the standard Residence Inn or Courtyard has better towels. Second, the concierge lounge is not open on weekends and when it is open it charges for wine & alcohol. (Ok, on the positive side, you also know it's a Marriott because it's clean and the staff are friendly.)

When we discovered that my Marriott number had not been included in the reservation, it was added and I was given an upgraded room. Room Regular rooms are a little on the small side, however, are definitely adequate. The corner rooms they use for upgrades are great! Although hallways are a little worn, the rooms are newly redone and have a modern flair. Beds are comfy and bathrooms spotless. Beware of rooms on the lower floors on the California side of the building -- you'll hear quite a bit of trolley noise at all hours. Concierge Lounge While I was staying this fall, they opened their new concierge lounge. It's an excellent amenity. Breakfast options are the standard eggs, fruit, bread, pasties, hot / cold cereal, etc, but the service and staff make it so much fun! Views from the lounge are great, especially at sunset. Happy hour appetizers are very nice. There were 1-2 hot items, veges, cheeses, cold cuts, etc. I really enjoyed this lounge, and I've gotten to where they don't generally impress me much.

The hotel also has a complimentary car service they'll let you use if it's available. Atmosphere / Character What I like most, is the feeling. The property is small enough that people know you.

It was pretty hard to figure out how to use the fancy Sony alarm clock though. The safe is in the desk drawer and has ample space for my notebook computer. The only hard part is the location. Although nice and exclusive, it is on a steep hill if you walk up from Market or Union Square. There are 3 blocks of very steep hill to walk.

The hotel came highly recommended by a Travel Consultant at a well known holiday firm so even though I had not done any research prior to booking the San Francisco portion of my 2 week US holiday, I felt this recommendation gave me a certain degree of confidence that it would match my expectations. However, subsequent reviews I read on Trip Advisor where far from reassuring but as with everything, I arrived at the Hotel with an open mind. On arrival at the Hotel, I was far from impressed with the frontage - it was hardly a grand entrance although the fountain in the courtyard was pretty and the only redeeming feature. I noticed a sign stating that the Hotel was working to improve that area so this maybe accounted for the litter and dirty appearance of the entrance. On entering the Hotel, we were met with what can only be described as chaos. The lobby was full of people attempting to check-in, the majority of whom were cabin crew from the flight we had just arrived on! There is no signage in the reception area so we just queued up hoping that we were at the right desk which fortunately we were. Whilst the lobby area was chaotic, we did not have to wait that long. The check in process itself was efficient and the receptionist was very pleasant and helpful. I checked that my view room request had been honoured to which I was informed it had and the room was on the fourth floor so I felt quite optimistic. The reception area is quite modern and tastefully decorated, unlike the fourth floor which was like stepping into the 1970s with a psychedelic yellow carpet which was quite heavily stained and the corridors to the room had a very stale aroma. The room itself was quite spacious, being bright and airy - with two large windows as it was a corner room. Whilst the room did have a view, it was not a bay view and the room was located next door to the parking lot/delivery area of the Hotel next door so the noise level early in the morning especially was very annoying. The furnishings were a mish mash of ancient and modern but certainly satisfcatory. The space was wasted with the provision of two very large chairs and footstools more akin to a retirement home. The bathroom was satisfactory too although the bath was very small and the shower/tiles were in need of a deep clean as they were covered in mould and mildew. The room had a safe and tea/coffee making facilities which was a welcome addition and the television was modern with a large selection of channels and pay per view channels. It was a pity that the room did not contain a mini bar which would have been a useful provision especially as the hotel did not have a shop for the purchase of drinks/snacks. On arrival at the room, we could not find the remote control for the television so asked a member of the housekeeping team who was nearby for a replacement. She brought along a replacement which did not have any batteries and after a further request, a working remote control was delivered about 20 minutes later. Other annoyances relating to our room during our stay included the bathroom light which came on and off during the night as the movement sensor must have been faulty; the sink plug mechansim was broken on arrival although it was fixed the following day after my leaving a note; the housekeeping team were very poor when it came to the replenishment of the stocks of tea/coffee/milk - most days we were left 2 coffee sachets (one decaf and one normal), 2 small milks and often left only one disposable cup! We left notes each day which were largely ignored ; the room started with the provision of 4 glasses which were never replaced after use - they were simply removed from the room so at the end of our stay we had no glasses. The main disappointement with the room was the standard of cleaning which was very poor indeed - on our final day prior to checking out we did the usual cursory search of the room to check for mislaid socks etc and on checking under the bed, we were disgusted to find an inch of dust and loads of litter and mess along with two television remote controls. The beds had not been cleaned under for months which was not acceptable. The only redeeming feature of this hotel was its location which was excellent with 2 cable car lines directly outside the hotel which enabled easy transfer to all the tourist locations. Whilst I did not complain on checking out, I hope the management of the Hotel will take on board my observations which represent a true and accurate reflection of the standards we experienced. Whilst we were not really impressed, this hotel is satisfactory in its own right and a little more attention to detail and modernisation of the facilities would certainly make a big difference overall.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHotel looks great but Beware of the Parking charge\u201d", "Author": "honeymoonin", "ReviewID": "UR34384434", "Content": "I found a great $119 non refundable rate in August but beware of taking a rental car or your own car there.

Room 541 had an amazing view of the Transamerica pyramid, and the bay, and with the windows open I could easily hear the \"clang, clang, clang\" of the cable car bell below on Powell Street (they stop running between midnite and 7am). \"Kristina\" found me a queen sized room so I could \"have extra space\". The room, though small by the standards of the major, homogeneous (and tedious) chain hotels, felt spacious and accommodating. The comfy wing back chair and foot stool made for a great spot to enjoy the decadent cocktail the ultra friendly room service folk whisked up to me shortly after my arrival. The bathroom had a rather out of place industrial commode, and the water pressure and temperate varied widely (as is common in San Francisco with the hills and old pipes/sewage system). However, the dressing room was spacious, and well stocked with 2 fluffy robes, iron/board, toiletries, and a great full sized hair dryer and full length mirror (why can't all hotels provide these?!). The bed was a bit firm, but the ample pillows made for a great night's sleep. If I had any complaints: 1. The lack of a \"mini bar\" made for a difficult choice of drinking tap water, or trudging downhill in my robe and slippers at 2 in the morning to the grocers. 2. There were no bell-hops to speak of, just an over eager security guard who was being uber protective of the obnoxious Englishwoman who was harassing me in the lobby. 3. The \"entertainment system\" was anything but--all music was \"pay per listen\" as were the films. Only network TV and some random cable re-runs were free. 4. The air-conditioning needs a tune up. It was rather obtrusive. 5. High-speed internet in such a hotel should always be free.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cIt's about the Staff; the most hospitable and gracious group of people imaginable.\u201d", "Author": "HaydenLosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR30238834", "Content": "Our company sponsored a conference at The Stanford Court and necessarily required more interaction and assistance than leisure guests would.

The room was huge and gorgeous. The staff was professional and friendly. The location was excellent and all the public areas were we appointed. They had evening free champaign (unlimited).

I am a Marriott Gold Member and this is by far the nicest of the Marriott properties in SF. I visited the other two Marriotts and they both looked very corporate/business hotels. This hotel has charm and personality. The Fisherman's Wharf Marriott looked like a dump actually. 3- Staff. They were very friendly, remembered us in the lobby and every day at breakfast. Offered us bottled water upon check in. Gave us a better room with a better view. Smiles and greetings throughout our stay. 4- Location - Nobb hill, like some of the reviewers have posted is a bit of a steep incline, but being from NYC we are use to walking so it wasn't a big deal for us.

Our room was on the fifth floor with city views. It was beautifully decorated and newly refurbished. The beds were extremely comfortable and triple-sheeted. There was a nice, large flat screen television. The room was very quiet, except during the day when there was the noise of construction. It wasn't horrible, but could be heard. It was also very clean. There were nice robes for after showering. On the downside: the room was quite small. One of our double beds was pushed up against the wall, so whoever slept there (me!) had to crawl over the other person. The bathroom was also quite small, especially the vanity area. The toilet and shower were separate from the vanity, which was nice. The room did not have a mini-bar or a dresser. Since the room was small, we had suitcases every where. Our boys had room service several times as my husband were going out for dinner. The service was quick (20 minutes or so) and the food was very good and excellently transported. For example, the milks and ice cream were kept on ice to keep them cold. The staff was friendly. Of course, it was very expensive. We paid about $40 dollars every night for a small pepperoni pizza, pb&J, 2 milks, and two cookies by the time we paid the already high-cost of the food, delivery fee, and gratuity. Food in San Francisco is very expensive in general, and the convenience was nice and allowed my husband and me to get ready for a night out and gave our kids a treat of room service in front of the TV. The hotel is located at the top of Nob Hill and at the intersection of two cable car lines. It is only three blocks from China Town and close to a nice shopping district. There are some beautiful views. Walking in San Francisco and especially this area is quite a workout! The hills are very steep and it is straight up hill to the Stanford Court from every direction! As I said, two cable car lines stop in front of the hotel, which is nice, but they can be extremely crowded and you may need to be aggressive if you have stood at the cable car stop for awhile only to be pushed out of the way by others running for the car as it stops. This was a nice hotel, located in a pretty and historical area. Nob Hill was the center of old San Francisco wealth in the early 20th century.

This is an older building, built around a courtyard, without the 40 stories that offer spectacular views of the Bay or Telegraph Hill, but it is 2nd to none regarding location, appointments, convenience and service. Biggest test in these older buildings are the bathrooms and the \"corner\" areas -- bottom line, they passed. The property has been nicely updated and all the modern amenities are in place. . In very few cases, I say this, but I would DEFINITELY seek and attempt to stay in the Stanford Court on my next trip to San Francisco. . Granted, the property is still a bit challenged by the history (this can be a plus, if one likes that sort of thing) so there isn't a super-sleek multi-story lobby, or a chi-chi destination restaurant or bar. (they happen to be just outside less than 2 blocks away!). In my too-brief 14 hour stay, I also experienced EXCELLENT service by a staff that obviously gives a hoot about the comfort of its guests.

So you can imagine, I wanted everything to be just right for our special trip! I spent ages researching on Trip Advisor, to decide which hotel to stay in for our special time away. The hotel didn't dissapoint at all........ Public areas: Clean, tidy & spacious. Room: Clean, comfy bed, nice bathroom, big wardrobe & never heard any noise from other guests. View was OK, nothing special but we never asked for any particular view. Location: I don't think it could have been better, excellent for the Cable Cars - (Powell/Mason, Powell/Hyde Cable cars stop right outside the hotel). You could walk down to the Pier 39/Fishermans Wharf area in 10 minutes - then get the Cable car back up. A good restaurant in that area for a lovely breakfast /lunch is the Eagle Cafe. We did try to get into Mamas on Washington Square twice, but the queue was too long and we were too hungry - we went twice to the Eagle Cafe as it was so nice, with little waiting time. Also, you can walk to Union Square too, again roughly 10 minutes. However, if you do want to be in the bustle of it all, it is located that bit further out of the tourist areas. We wanted to be a little bit away from the tourist areas, so we were very happy with its location. Staff: Friendly at all times, concierge very helpful with restaurant bookings and directions. Alfreds Steakhouse was very nice for our last night - what a steak! Overall, a well kept hotel, with good staff in a great location. If I was returning to San Francisco, I would stay in this hotel again without any hesitation. One thing I would recommend for you to do, and this isn't hotel related - if your heart is set on visiting Alcatraz, book it before you leave. We were lucky that we were there for 4 nights, we went down to the Alcatraz tour area on our first day, and it was booked up for two days, luckily we managed to go on our last day on the day tour.

I just can't believe they feel justified charging the prices they do! We would have been just as well off at the Best Western for a much more fair price. To start, there is virtually no parking around, so you have to buy the hotel parking at $41 per day! And it takes about half an hour for the valet to retrieve your car when requested - even though their lot is just a block away! When we checked in, the staff was about the rudest I've ever dealt with. Throughout our stay, every one of them acted as if our speaking to them was offensive. They were unhelpful, abrupt, unfriendly, and not one ever smiled at us or went to even the slightest effort to make us feel that the hotel appreciated our business. It was as if we were inconveniencing them. The room was on the verge of unacceptable. It was just barely clean. It looked as if nobody had vacuumed around the furniture or base boards in a few months, the shower had mildew build up along the grout lines, the towel warmer was broken, there were stains on the walls, carpet and doors, and everything just looked dingy, dinged up, and poorly cared for. Even the common areas, like hallways and elevators were unclean, dinged or scuffed, and poorly kept up. The furniture and decor was quite old and unattractive. It appeared to be last updated in the late 70's or early 80's. The TV is old and crappy with very poor reception. There isn't even a DVD player available! Although, the comforter and duvet did appear to be fairly new and fresh. There were some toiletries provided in the bathroom along with a coffee maker and a couple packets of coffee grounds. The first morning, I went to use some of the mouthwash, only to find that the seal was already broken! Did they refill the previous guests bottle of mouthwash?! Don't they check to see if they've been used between guests?! Gross. We tried to have some coffee too, but it was just revolting. So, now that you've paid a totally unreasonable price for a crappy room and someone to park our car a half an hour away, be prepared to shell out for internet access and breakfast. I just can't believe that a \"nice\" place like this doesn't offer some sort of complimentary continental breakfast! They have a little card in the room you can leave out on your door handle to order breakfast to be delivered in the morning. But, it's $16 for a basic continental breakfast of a pastry and coffee! We walked down the street to a local coffee shop for coffee, juice and a bagel sandwich for less than $5. And, you'd think everyone offers free WiFi these days, right? Not so at the Stanford Court. You have to pay $10 per day! And if you want to just use the business center to check your e-mail real quick - better get out your wallet for that too! We had ordered a room with two double beds, but were give one queen. So, we requested a roll away bed and some extra bedding. No luck. They were out! So, I asked for some extra bedding so one of us could sleep on the floor. Nope, none of those either. Finally after throwing a fit, the manager agreed to pull just a comforter off the bed of a vacant room. There are feather beds on the mattresses, so we pulled that off the queen and used it for a mattress on the floor. Luckily there was an extra pillow in the room. The next night I tried again to request a roll away. This time we were in luck, and it was delivered while we were out during the day. I would never stay here again. I would never recommend it, unless the only other option was some roach infested dive in the wrong part of town.

Also, our food tray was still in the hallway that we left outside our door earlier that morning and ten hours later it was still sitting there when we returned to our room. The coffee pot in the room can only make one cup of coffee at a time so for two people, it takes too much time to make coffee.

Must dos are going to the Cheesecake Factory to eat at the top of Macy's. Great views and gorgeous food. We took two bus tours of the city also - one for the downtown area and the other over the Golden Gate Bridge. My advice is to book Alcatraz before you come out as it gets booked up really quickly - they only let a relatively small number over everyday - but it means it's not at all crowded when you're over there. Book the Early Bird Tour. It's a fascinating, eerie place to walk around and you can stay on the island as long as you want once you're out there. If you want to go out for the evening, we had a great night out in Little Italy. Some fab italian restaurants and bars. Everyone is really friendly and we met some great people - including some Virgin Atlantic Crew who were also staying at the Stanford Court whilst in San Fran!

I wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday by spending a weekend in San Francisco. Considering the location and ameneties, the price that we paid was incredible!

But given the prices for parking in the city ($30~$50/24-hour period) there may be no way to avoid this - unless of course you arrive using public transport! Location: This hotel is located on the corner of California and Powell in the Nob Hill neighborhood. All three of the cable car lines pass right in front of the hotel. There is also a little ticket booth there to purchase tickets. Very very convenient. There are quite a few really nice neighborhood restaurants for breakfast/lunch or dinner. We chose Roxanne's cafe for a wonderful breakfast on Sunday morning. This hotel is also right next to the Grace Cathedral - a magnificent church in a wonderful setting. For families with little kids, do note that there is a really nice kiddie play structure in the park that is right opposite the church. Our kids spent quite some time entertaining themselves in the park while my wife and I had the chance to sit down and chat amongst a wonderful setting. Very pleasing. Check-in: The check-in process was very pleasant and cheerful - as befits a hotel of this calibre. I mentioned to the receptionist as I was checking in that it was my wife's birthday and I would be really grateful if she can give us a good room. She put us in a room that was facing the corner of California and Powell! Very wonderful view of the Transamerica building (see photographs). It was very nice of her. When we found out that there was only a Queen bed in the room, they brought in a complimentary roll-away for the kids! The downside for this particular room was that it was right above the cable car lines. We heard the clang-clang of the cable cars all the way up till midnight! My kids thought it was pretty cool that \"trains\" were right outside our hotel room - but the noise got a bit tiresome after a while. But the noise was more than compensated by the wonderful views! Room: The rooms are tastefully decorated in a muted Asian motiff. However the bathroom was beginning to show it's age (both in decor and usage). The hotel itself is built as a rectangular building around a central courtyard. The corridors are quite long and there is only one set of elevators - so be prepared for a long walk if your room is at the other end of the hotel! Food: Since there were so many wonderful dining opportunitites around the hotel, we did not even try anything in the hotel. They have a breakfast buffet on the weekends for $29.95pp and the spread seemed to be quite substantial. We looked but did not partake. Service: Considering the star-level of the hotel, the service was par for the course. They will address you by your last name most of the time!!

The first of the three centred holiday (moving on to Vegas and then Longbeach, LA). We had a fabulaous welcome at the hotel - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was situated on the 4th floor / corner room. It was spacious, comfortable (especially the beds), and clean, with pretty good views. It was rated by our travel agent as a 4*, which seems a pretty fair reflection. The breakfast buffet was the only thing to let the hotel down. But we'd highly recommend ordering from the breakfast menu, which was slightly more costly, but everything is made to order. The lemon souffle pancakes with raspberries were fantastic! We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient, especially as the cable car line runs directly outside the entrance. The most economical way to travel, is to buy a MUNI passport (which can be bought at the information desk at the airport - $24 per person, for a 1 week pass). When you add up the cost of every 'single' trip cable car ticket costing $5, the passport was exceptional value. It can be used without limit on ANY of the Muni transport around the city i.e. - cable cars/ electric trams/ trolley buses/ & 'bendy' buses. We found these passports invaluable, and we hardly used taxis nor the hotel limo service, (which is provided on a first come first serve basis). Despite public transport being very accessible, if you've never been to the city before, be prepared to do a lot of walking (so comfortable, flat shoes are a must).

The most recent stay was for three nights in August, 2007. DECOR: This hotel is done in an understated traditional style with Asian influences and antiques. I really like the hotel's style. I disagree with other reviewers that this hotel is dated. I think of it as well preserved and in my opinion, in a very good and charming way. It's like going to my rich aunt's house in the 1960's. The furnishings are, at first glance, not remarkable. Upon further inspection, however, you're forced to admit that while not flashy, everything is tastefully done and of high quality. ROOM: I had deluxe bay view room one night and an executive king room the last two nights. Both rooms were wonderful. I'm not sure I'd pay the additional cost for the executive king, though. It did have a very comfortable couch, however. I love the featherbeds placed over the mattress - - great sleeping and lounging. Oh, the down pillows and duvet were very comfortable. I like the color scheme: teal carpet, cream walls, blue upholstery, crystal lamps, floral drapes, and Asian accents. My room was spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. I also liked the marble bathroom. It had a large vanity and closet. The airconditioning worked very well and kept my room comfortable. SERVICE: Very good. Staff here is not as friendly as some of the other hotels I stay at, but they're never rude and are always helpful. FITNESS CENTER: The hotel has a nice fitness center with great equipment. Most of the machines have individual TVs on them although I don't think headphones are provided - - so bring your own. LOCATION: Wonderful location atop Nob Hill. Your within easy walking distance to Union Square, China Town, North Beach, and Russian Hill. The location affords some rooms outstanding views of downtown, Coit Tower, and the bay.

Also the room had stains on the carpeting, furniture, and the grout of the bathroom was disgusting. For the price that they ask for this hotel I expected it to be at least clean!!!! After speaking with the front desk they explained they were on a sold out status but could upgrade me for an additional charge of $30. Being that I had already paid $280 a night for this property and had also made multiple calls I refused and said I would be down to speak to the manager. When I spoke to the manager he reiterated what I was told but when I mentioned to him they offered me another room for an additional charge he denied they offered that for a two bed room. I finally told him that I would stay at a different property if he could find one. After 20min the manager came back and advised me that a room \"Miraculously\" became available but it needed to be cleaned. He offered my sister and I a drink in the lobby while we waited. An entire bottle of wine later the room was still not available. After 1 hour we finally went up and showed us our room. This room was an improvement but it had a smell of a wet dog. Being that the property does allow animals under 25lbs I accepeted that the prior guest must have had a pet and that the maids are unable to clean at a standard that I had expected for the price i was paying. Overall the stay was not one that I would recommend. I have stayed at numerous properties in the San Francisco area and this one is just not worth the price. Also for those of you that do not have a rental car or prefer to roam around the city by foot, BE AWARE that this property is on top of a HUGE hill and it is a very steep incline.

Having read the very mixed reviews this property received, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very accommodating, right from check in. I needed a room on the same floor as the director of my organization and they arranged that. They also arranged to have the down-filled bedding removed from my bed, as I am very allergic. My daughter kept her down feather bed and duvet and loved it. Even without the luxury bedding my bed linens and bed were quite comfortable. The room was a corner room with views of the city, the bay, and the Transamerica building. Very spacious, clean, and decorated in an Asian-themed English country style. Very pretty. The bathroom was clean, bright, and certainly roomy enough--and the little color TV on the counter was a nice touch. There was a heat lamp in the ceiling, heated towel bars, and a phone as well. Also a vanity bench, which made dressing and doing makeup easier. We experienced no major problems with noise except for the occasional cable cars--and we expected that--it's the sound of the city and we didn't mind. And they don't run all night, so sleeping is fine. Morning beverages were always there on time and were hot. Wake up calls were on time, too. So was USA Today. The staff was courteous and accommodating. In fact, the day we left for the airport we were waiting in the lobby for a 4:30 am shuttle. The evening manager came over to us, offered us coffee, and stayed and chatted with us until the shuttle arrived. He even had the concierge call the shuttle company to confirm arrival, even though we'd done so the day before. The concierge staff was knowledgeable and courteous--made reservations, checked menus, helped us book tours of wine country, Muir Woods and Sausalito. The hotel's town car (free during business hours) took us downtown to an off-the-beaten track shopping area the concierge recommended. In regard to the conference itself, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, the meeting spaces were just fine, and the meals - held in the hotel restaurant - were delicious. My daughter is a vegetarian and the waitstaff made sure that she had appropriate food even though it was a set conference menu. Turndown service is available upon request and the evening housekeeping staff were very friendly--going so far as to give my daughter many extra chocolates every evening--suffice it to say she was quite pleased. We never met the day staff so I can't say anything about them other than the room was made up perfectly each day. Just a couple of minor negatives. 1. We had problems with our keys demagnetizing so that they didn't work. Since there were two of us, it was OK--seemed like one of always had a working key--but each day we needed to get the keys changed. 2. We had a connecting room - the door was closed and locked, but one evening we could clearly hear voices in the adjoining room. But that ended quickly. If there was a loud group I think it would have been pretty bad. 3. Room service is expensive (but yummy) and we had a few things that they forgot and had to bring up after the initial delivery. But it was taken care of. 4. There is nowhere for a reasonably priced breakfast in the hotel. Restaurant and room service are very pricy for any meal, but especially for breakfast. I completed the hotel's guest feedback form and mentioned my pleasure in the property, but the few problems and I received a personal e-mail thanking me for my feedback and asking for specifics so the problems could be addressed. I heard only good things from the conference attendees about the property. Everyone seemed to find the accommodations quite acceptable. The location on Nob Hill is convenient to a number of cable car lines and is within walking distance of Union Square shopping, Chinatown, and the theatre/restaurant district. A good walker could even make it down to the waterfront. Speaking of walking--we managed the hills quite well on foot, surprising ourselves. A colleague who is a native said that she has \"buns of steel\" from the hills--and I can see why. One does get a workout. Just going walking feels like a good day at the gym.

But when I walked into my ugly, smelly room and saw that it was 2 full beds instead of a king, I called him to inquire. Instead of explaining that it was a full house and that was their only room left, he rudely said, \"I'm looking at your reservations right now and it doesn't say that you have a guarantee for a king.\" He obviously needs a course in customer service. I will NEVER EVER return to this property again, even if it was offered to me for free. As a matter of fact, I stayed here on this occassion because an annual conference I attend in SF was held here.

We arrived full of anticipation of staying in a 5 star hotel. When we left the Stanford Court we were and are determined never to stay at a Marriott hotel again. The lack of service from the hotel staff was unacceptable. The lack of comfort and cleanliness in our room was deplorable. When we arrived the desk clerks were rude and rushed. Our room (#436) was filthy. The bed sheets had a hole in them, the carpet was stained throughout, the bathroom had mold growing on the shower doors and in the tile of the floor, dust covered everything, there was a very strong musty smell, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was mismatched (Asian paintings, oak entertainment center, bed coverings in a tacky floral print, drapes in a southwest motif, and a bed frame in faux bamboo), simply not coordinated at all. The heat lamp timer in our bathroom was broken and the water pressure in the shower was very low. Sometimes the water stopped during the shower. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 bought a pair of jeans during our stay and needed to remove the tags. I called the concierge who told me to call back as he was busy at the moment. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even offer to call us back. I called the front desk and asked if a pair of scissors could be brought to our room. The front desk clerk told us they could not send scissors for safety reasons. I asked her what she would suggest I do. She said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you have a pocket knife you should try that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Why would I call to request scissors if I had a pocket knife? This was insulting and rude. I took it upon myself to go to the gift shop and they had travel scissors that she let me borrow. The hotel desk clerk could have informed us about this which would have saved me 30 minutes. The complimentary beverages with a wake up call were ridiculous. Neither of us drinks coffee so we opted for the hot chocolate. When it arrived it was cold and very watered down. I later learned that it was Nestle Instant Cocoa Packets added to water. This hotel is located in San Francisco, home to one of the most famous chocolate companies in the world! Why would the hotel not use Ghirardelli? For the cost of the stay and the star rating of this hotel, instant cocoa packets are far below acceptable. For our 2nd wake up call I requested an extra packet of hot cocoa since the first was watered down. The front desk clerk assured me it would be sent. Our 2nd morning wake up call was 1 hour late! They only sent us 1 mug and instead of an extra packet of cocoa they sent us 10 extra packets of sweet-n-low! I called the front desk and complained. No apology was offered. I asked for a 2nd mug and an extra packet of cocoa. 15 minutes later we received an extra carafe of cocoa, no 2nd mug, and no extra packets of cocoa. The service was unbelievably incompetent! Our second night at the hotel the weather was very cold and rainy. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 requested a cup of tea from the front desk. They told her it would cost $5 plus $3 room service fee. $8 for a cup of tea is ridiculous! I told the front desk that they offered free tea to guests in the morning, could they please offer it now. I was rudely told no. I asked if they could at least bring us some water and the front desk clerk told me to use the vending machine on the 2nd floor. Needless to say I was furious. A 5 star hotel could not even offer complimentary water to guests?!?! I took it upon myself to walk down to the restaurant located in the hotel. I told the maitre d' our circumstances and in less than 5 minutes he gave me 2 bottles of water and a cup of hot tea at no charge. Why could the hotel not do this? Why could the hotel not at least refer us to the restaurant? The complimentary town car service offered to guests on the Monday we were there was a joke. We waited 15 minutes for an available car at 8am in the morning. We then were told we had to share it with another couple going to a convention. I explained to the driver that we were meeting friends for breakfast at 8:20 at Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf. He assured me he would get us there on time. He got lost driving the other couple to their destination making us 15 minutes late to our breakfast reservations. We drove 17 hours to San Francisco stopping on the way spontaneously at a Best Western Motel. The quality of service we received there was far superior to the Stanford Court hotel and the comfort of the bed even better. The bed in our room at Stanford Court had spring coils that could be felt through the mattress! Our trip was completely ruined and what was supposed to be a romantic weekend getaway for my new fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I ended up being a frustrating uncomfortable stay. I expected more from Marriott, to at least have them live up to the standards of being a 5 star hotel. I will not be staying at the Stanford Court ever again in the future. When choosing a hotel in the future for any destination, Marriott will be last on our list if at all. Be warned: Parking at the hotel cost us over $100 for 2 nights! Absolutely crazy.

I was overall very satisfied by the hotel but I was disappointed in some areas. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the front desk staff is a little cold. Not necessarily rude but just stiff and not very welcoming. They were accommodating when our room wasn't ready even though it was well past the check in time so we ended up in a large corner unit with pretty decent views. The doormen and the housekeeping staff are excellent - we were always happily greeted and they were responsive to our needs. There were some nice amenities but quite overrated. We had bathrobes which were a nice touch. The heated towel rack didn't do much to heat the towel except in the three spots where the rack hit the towel - maybe my expectation was too high. What I liked much better was the heat lamp which kept the room toasty so you didnt get the chills when you emerged from the shower. The showers are awesome - the water pressure was perfect. I don't usually make showerheads a point in my reviews but it was that memorable! Also, all the beds had the amazing new marriott featherbeds which are just heavenly. The coffee, tea or hot chocolate service in the mornings was nice too but don't expect the beverages to be of high quality. My friend and I walked almost all of San Francisco. We had dinner in the Union Square area most nights and would trek back up the 4 or 5 blocks uphill to the hotel. We don't exercise but we are from cities where we walk a lot, albeit on flat ground. I would use your own judgement for walking around but you can save a lot of money and see much more by walking. The public transportation system is confusing because there are 10 different types of public transport serving limited areas. BART seems to be more of a commuter train going out to suburbs with select stops in the city. Buses weren't the best option because it can be confusing for tourists. The cable cars don't go very far and for $5 per one-way ride, it's a total rip-off. There was also some cable train system which was cheap and got us out to Castro but it took a lot of maps and research to get around for cheap.

The closet was in the bathroom with the sink area, but the toilet and shower were in a separate room. There was an old TV by the sink which was old and dusty. (didn't bother to use it) There was two turn down service per day. No refrigerator in the room! and there was a charge for internet service per day. However, the concierge was friendly and helpful in planning our trip down to Hearst Castle, and he even booked it for us. Also, the good thing about the Stanford Court is its location, alot more closer to Union Square than the Omni, and three cable cars stop right at its corner. The loading area is inside the court of the hotel which makes loading and unloading very easy because you can park right there and not worry about traffic. The Stanford Court is on one of San Francisco's highest hills and walking down is fun but it is advised you take a cable car back up its 45 degree hills. Overall, if you don't want to spend too much on a hotel and you like to shop then I would recommend staying here since its pretty close to the shopping area.

After viewing the lobby I expected more grand things in our room and was disappointed. The room was fine - it was clean & nice but it smelled like an antique store; old. The hotel is definitely an older hotel in need of some upgrades. The bathroom looked like it'd last been renovated in the 1960's, but was otherwise clean. What has room for improvement is the price of all the incidentals at this hotel. The drink prices in the lobby bar, the room service prices and the parking was highway robbery. Beware: They only offer valet parking (there's no self-parking available and according to the front desk, none nearby.) The only alternative is street parking, which is metered. I suppose if we'd have wanted to walk several blocks we could have found self-parking, but since we were in the City to go to the opera and a nice dinner we weren't exactly in walking attire. The total bill for one night of valet parking was $46.74 including tax. If we'd been told it was that much up front we could have found cheaper parking & taken BART or a quick taxi ride back to the hotel and saved money. I know San Fran isn't known for its inexpensive parking, but we felt almost $47/night was just a little much. Overall, if The Stanford Court were to remodel its hotel it'd seem more reasonable to pay the high prices, but with its current condition we feel they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a bit overpriced.

I stayed for three nights June 4-7.

Ticket price on BART from the airport were $4.95pp. (Instead of $30+ for cab) The walk gets difficult the last three blocks but worth the savings. For someone who is not as adventurous you can take the cable car (stops at the corner of Powell and California) to the top of the hill for $3pp. Upon arriving at the hotel I sensed a little attitude from Rochelle about being a Priceline customer and got a 1st floor room facing Powell Street. We had a really good view of the financial district because the hotel is on the hill anyway and the first floor is basicall the third floor. We could hear the cable cars below and some traffic but it never disturbed me or interupted sleep. The rooms facing the street were large compared the others I saw overlooking the courtyard. The room is confortable but a little antiquated. The old TV in the bathroom was a joke at first but was really handy as I was getting ready in the morning. Is located in a great location for tourists. We walked to North Beach (recommend Pasta Pomodoro for a reasonably priced meal), Fishermans Wharf, Union Square, Coit Tower etc. etc. I wouldn't reccommend it for someone with a bad ticker but it can be done by someone young and fit with no problem.

I think there may be some staff and management that may not handle complaints well, UNLESS the complaints are presented in a calm and undemanding manner. Presentation of a problem is very important. Yet, I do get the impression that management pays very close attention to where you purchase your room and how much you pay. And this does determines the quality of room you receive.

We were very displeased and disappointed with the condition and size of the room and bathroom. We booked a \"family room\" which had two queen beds. Because I was traveling with my spouse and two teen children, I was expecting a larger room with adequate storage for clothes. I have been a Marriott member for many years, and this is quite honestly, the worst Marriott property I have ever stayed at. Upon arrival, the bellman took us to our room and immediately suggested that I contact the front desk and ask for another room, because he felt that there might a better accommodation for us. Unfortunately, the hotel was booked out and there was not another room to be had. Even though I complained, they never offered to make amends of any sort. The front desk told me that they have a limited number of these so-called \"family rooms\" and because of that they are always booked up and never have a chance to refurb them. There was no storage for clothes and limited floor space for suitcases. We had to live out of our suitcases - and pushed the two chairs together to make room to get one suitcase off the floor. Everything was old - carpet, furniture, and the bathroom is another story. Outside the bathroom, was a separate counter with a sink and an old TV sitting on it. If they consider this an amenity, they better think again. It looked like it was from the 1970's and worse yet, no one had ever taken a dust rag or cleaned it in all that time. When I tell you it was laden with filth and grime, it is no exaggeration. Who would want to touch it to even turn it on. It would have been better to remove it altogether, and make more room on the counter. The bathroom had an old rubber bathmat hung over the shower door that was covered with dirt or mold - couldn't tell which. It surely would have been a breeding ground for athletes foot. I did complain to housekeeping and they wiped off the TV and brought a new rubber bathmat. Considering the state of the room, nothing housekeeping could have done, would have made it much better. I work out daily, and the workout room was small and dark, the worst I have ever encountered. The upside to this stay is that we were on the go all day long, and we did not spend much time in the room. If you like staying at nice properties and expect cleanliness and amenities, I would not stay here. By the way, there is no concierge level at this property.

On top of Nob hill at Powell and California we would walk down to union square or China Town and catch a trolly car back and no panhndling like I would have dealt with anywhere else. I would definetly go back.", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mass", "Title": "\u201cFavorite SF hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2884672", "Content": "This is a perfect balance of quality, service and price.

Room with 2 queens was very spacious, comfortable, and quiet, and service top notch. The Stanford Court will not be everyone's cup of tea--it's kind of old fashioned and the rooms and furnishings are deliberately retro, down to the pocket doors leading into the bathroom and the ancient mini tv/radio in the bath area. everything has been updated recently, but in kind of a glamourous hotel of yesteryear way. it does NOT look like a westin, at all, but i liked it quite a lot. several nice luxury touches, like the bathrobes, turndown with chocolates, free shoeshine. another plus is that on weekdays they have complimentary town car service within the city. beds were excellent and the service/lobby area were grand. it's a bit removed from the bustle of union sq, but not too far out of the way. i liked the fact that the surrounding area was quiet and not teeming with panhandlers, like some areas of union sq can be. we parked on the street nearby without any problems.", "Date": "November 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, CT", "Title": "\u201cAlways a pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Travelling_Wiz", "ReviewID": "UR2814353", "Content": "I visit San Francisco twice each year and always stay at Stanford Court.

Unfortunately it went down from there. The rooms are tired looking, even though they have recently been re-painted and wallpapered, along with new rugs and drapes. The furnishings are old and tired, a cane and rattan headboard just doesn't cut it in a \"luxury\" hotel. Some basics like an in-room safe and mini-bar are nowhere to be found. Coke and Ice Machines are located on the 2nd floor, not very convenient. A circa 1980's TV took up half the bathroom counterspace. Bathroom and dressing areas are tired and worn. Breakfast at the restaurant is top dollar, in the $30 (with tax and tip) per person range. I guess the room rates are reasonable for San Francisco, but the hotel is need of renovation.

We arrived at 9:30pm after a long flight from Australia. On check-in, we were greeted by a very helpful clerk who said that the hotel was extremely full due to the Labor Day weekend. That meant that our preference of King Bed and Non-Smoking room could not be met, which was frustrating seeing we had requested this when booking six weeks earlier. We eventually settled on the smoking room with the King Bed, which the clerk assured us was one of the \"bigger\" rooms. I can say that we were disappointed on entering the room. Whilst the smoke smell was not too bad (2 non smokers), the general quality of the room looked tired and old. The canopy over the top of the bed was broken, and our hairdryer didn't work and needed replacement. We tried to use the in-room internet via the television, and after 2 minutes use found that it did not support Google's gmail. We had to ring and request the charge be removed from our account, and also found out that general internet would then be $2.50 for five minutes in the business centre, which we found to be very expensive. We drank in the bar after returning from dinner on the Saturday night, and after one drink we were told the bar was closing (12:45am) despite advertising that it was opened until 2am. We were really trying to support the services of the hotel but felt let down. The location atop Nob Hill is excellent, however the cable cars were so full that we walked a few times up and down the hills. Good exercise! Overall, a stately hotel in its time, however the Renaissance Stanford Court really needs to lift its game if seriously aiming for the business travel and high end leisure market. If the rooms were refurbished and the facilities more accessible, we would probably stay again due to the location.", "Date": "October 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStanford Cout Thinks a Little to Highly of Themselves\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2603797", "Content": "The Stanford Court is nice but not that nice.

Comforter looks like something out of a Red Carpet Inn and pillows were tiny and flat. This place isn't bad it definietely isn't anything special. A couple good things, the cable car stop is right outside on the corner which is convenient (although walking is more efficient than the cable cars. Ride it you'll understand). Also the staff is knowledgeable and curtious. The food is delicious if you eat there at all. Overall though it isn't worth it.

I would rate the rooms a three star experience, while the service gets a four or five star. The Stanford Court was converted from an apartment building to a hotel in the 1970's and some of the interior design ideas of that era are still evident in the rooms, especially the dressing area and bath room with its white marble wall tiles and wood paneled partitions next to the 70's era vanity and sink, with chrome framed mirror. The overall design of the standard rooms is what I would call 'old English country style' with floral print bed bedspreads and drapes with blue carpeting. I believe a typical conservative grandmother would feel very comfortable here. The quality of the furnishings is good, but not anything special. The standard rooms are moderate in size with lots of light from windows that actually open for fresh air, which is great as long as you are not on the busy Powell or California street side of the building. The service on the other hand was exceptional. Every single staff member we encountered was very polite and helpful. Even though we arrived two hours prior to normal check-in time, there was no problem checking in early. The concierge desk was extremely helpful, especially when it came to securing a lunch reservation for us on short notice at one of the city's hip and hot new restaurants 'The Slanted Door' at the newly renovated Ferry Building. Although I would stay here again, I prefer being closer to the Union Square area, theatres, and the Muni Line on Market St., and not having to climb up Nob Hill to get back to the hotel since riding the cable car during the day is not convenient due to the long lines of people that are always waiting to get on.", "Date": "September 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "exeter, maine", "Title": "\u201cthe best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2526498", "Content": "This was a great hotel.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Best place I never stayed Booked this hotel via direct contact. Was travelling with 4 small children aged from 7 yrs down to 5 months.Arrived at hotel at 11pm after a 12 hour flight, to be told they had renovation issues and the rooms I had requested over a month before were not available.Perhaps maybe an email regarding this BEFORE arrival at some point would have been nice. I had requested connecting rooms, as the kids are so young theres no WAY they can sleep alone. He also suggested I sleep in one room with 2 of the kids, and the husband in another with the other 2. (Uhh, no thanks. I do actually LIKE to sleep with my husband on vacation.)After informing the desk clerk I wouldn't be able to stay as the accomodations they had offered instead did not suit our family - they didn't connect- I asked where he could suggest for us to go stay. He was EXTREMELY unhelpful, shrugged and said  try the Sheraton. Gosh, if i could AFFORD the Sheraton I wouldn't have booked at their extremely low budget hotel in the first place. Thanks for NOTHING.Thankfully, the Ohana Maile Hotel was nearby, and they were able to accomodate us with no fuss and brilliant service AND $74 a night CHEAPER than the Holiday surf. I was VERY pleased to be able to put 4 overtired kids to bed that night!.I wouldn't reccomend Holiday Surf to ANYONE.

Yes, it was a little noisy, but that's just part of life these days. Earplugs are cheap and worked great. We could hear what was going on outside but never heard anything from our neighbors. I would much rather hear a garbage truck once in a while than somebody's screaming kid or loud TV. Our room had one of the best showers I've ever had in a hotel. It was tall enough for both of us and had real water pressure. Try finding that in the fancy places. It was nice having a full kitchen to prepare meals in so we didn't have to waste money on eating out. Our room was clean, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel is also off the beaten path which is a plus in itself. Being able to go over to the canal and watch the sunrise every morning was priceless. If I ever get the chance to go back, this will be the place I stay again! If you want snobby upscale, go somewhere else and pay way too much for it but if you want comfort, convenience and friendliness, stay here.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR789780507", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pattirie"}, {"Content": "Good deal for the budget traveler I am retired and travel extensively. I have visited Hawaii often enough to know how expensive accommodation is, even for the budget traveler. I have just completed a 3 months stay on 3 of the 4 major islands and staying at the Holiday Surf for the last 27 days was the best deal I made on this trip. I was apprehensive at first, the \u9225\u6e15anager\u9225\u6a9a deal\u9225?offered on Craigslist was cheaper than the price asked by the Youth Hostel in Waikiki and some reviews on the internet were very negative. My needs are simple; I need a clean and quiet place to sleep and take a shower, possibly to eat dinner. I spend my day outside that is why I come to Hawaii. What I got at the Holiday Surf \u9225\u6e01nnex\u9225?(not the main building shown on their web site) was basically a small apartment of over 400 square feet (about 40 square meters) with a bedroom, toilet with shower, small living/dining room and a full kitchen basically furnished (no phone, no tv remote control, no internet) but clean. More than I hoped for. You won\u9225\u6a9b find the \u9225\u6e15anager\u9225\u6a9a deal\u9225?on the hotel website, watch Craigslist or send the hotel an e-mail.

Just been there and it the most terrible hotel I've ever stayed in my life. No...... it not even a hotel, I'd hardly even call it a motel.I've fallen for the nice pictures of rooms they posted on the website, but don't do it it's a trap. Everything is old and nasty in this hotel. Room keys always malfunctioned, and I had to go down everytime to ask them to renew them. Tv didn't have remote, I didn't even bother to ask for it. Parking is limitted to atmost 10 cars, Stuff in the rooms like bed, couch, chairs, kitchenware, table and etc is very old. Right next door to the entrance there was a big garbage container which smelled and once in a 2-3 days garbage truck made an awful lot of noice when unloading it early in the mornings. There were always couple guys hanging around the hotel, and they seemed like some kind of a crime to me. One thing which surprised me though is that they had wireless internet (for this kind of spooky place) and you have to pay $7 a day to use it.

I'm staying in a 1-bedroom with lots of space for 2 adults and 2 children. The Suite is comfortable and has quite a few amenities that aren't in the standard room - DVD player, microwave and newer furnishings. Every time we walk by the front desk, someone says Hello, How's your day going?. If I need help with anything - Where to eat, how to get downtown or to the North Shore, which show is the better value - they'll openly tell me the best and the worst, in their opinion, of course. But some hotel staff don't even know their own city. We stopped by the Sheraton on our way to a luau and asked one of the desk people where to catch the shuttle for Paradise Cove, and they just said I don't know. They didn't even offer to help find out or direct us to someone who knows. The staff at the Holiday Surf can either tell you where somethingis, or they'll show you what booklet to look in for the information. I'm having a great time, and I just wanted to let people know - I'd rather spend my money on good dinners and shows than waste it on an expensive hotel room. Like I said, it's not the fanciest hotel in Waikiki, but it's right in the center and only 2 blocks from the beach, so I can walk to restaurants, shows and shopping. We'll come back again next year. I noticed that a lot of people write bad reviews, when they don't like something, but We're having a great time, and we whould let people know about it.

I for one when something is good or someone does something good think they should be told that it made me feel good for there efforts. And sometimes there is a problem. If one asks in a pleasant way most hotels will correct it.I have been a frequent guest for over 7 years and will continue to stay there. The owners make me feel like its home at this point. I find the holiday surf and its staff very friendly and helpful. The price is very reasonable. The location is very nice and the walk to the beach. Is not far at all. It overlooks the ala wai canal and its many fascinating goings on. It also overlooks the mountains with its rainbows almost daily.The bus is just a block away. Too many fine restaurants to mention just a short walk away. it is a comfortable walk to the beach and park.It is not a new hotel but it is kept up very well. it is clean and the beds are comfortable, the showers are terrific and I have never had a problem with hot water.

The owner, Patrick Chun, assured me that they had the best otel in town! Boy was I WRONG! Not only was the facility $1400 for the week PLUS a $300 deposit for parking and cleaning (whatever that was about) .. I wasn't upset with the rates as long as I was getting a superb experience. The apartment/hotel sits on a street that has a ton of prostitutes walking up and down it. The lady at the front desk told me that the curfew for the hotel was 9pm because  Hookers tend to straggle in with hotel guests I was thinking..  GREAT!  As soon as we entered into our room the dishes were FILTHY and still in the sink. The furniture had blankets over it covering up the stains, holes, and broken details. (Here's the kicker!!) My 18 month old son is running to the window to pick up what appears to be a pacifer.. which (sad to say ) was an open condom. Under the bed was a pile of clothes and a pair of shoes. Did we check out?? YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT! The place was BEYOND gross.. the hotel manager, Patrick Chun, wouldn't even come out of his office to deal with me. He just told the front clerk to give me my money back. The front desk clerk told me that a prostitute must have broken in their room again..

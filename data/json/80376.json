The water in the shower would not go down so basically if your sharing a room, you are sharing filth. The pictures of the hotel? Complete krap. The hotel is located next to a sleezy store with blocked out windows. The pool is small and uncomfortable with few people around. In our room, there was a picture in the bathroom that was hung up with some sort of masking tape. It continued to fall throughout our stay revealing cracked walls.

We stayed at the Ramada Maingate i/o Disney property thinking it would save us some money. Besides, we are in the parks all day/night so why would it matter where we sleep? WRONG!! It matters!!!! We would return late at night to find no fresh towels and the coffee hadn't been replenished. Not a huge deal but when it's 1am and you're exhausted the last thing you want to do is go downstairs to get towels and coffee. Also, we had no clock in our room. We asked 2 days in a row and never received one. I left a tip every day for housekeeping thinking we'd get better service (or service at all!!) and found no improvement. Walked in one night to find a huge bottle of chlorine/bleach cleaner on our sink w/ no top on it. Fumes galore not to mention if one of my kids had found it first. Yikes!! Condition of the room is dated but expected for the price. Carpet was pulled away from the wall in the kids area and carpet in king room was damp. My kids thought it was fun to try and catch the \"critters\" in our room. Yep, roaches.....lovely. We will not be returning to the hotel in the future. We have learned our lesson and will stay on property in the future. I don't expect fancy and new for the price but I do think it should be CLEAN and towels, etc. should be replaced.

I had never had a bad experience with a Ramada and decided that since we spend barely any time in our hotel while vacationing at Disney that we didn't need anything spectacular. Then, I read the reviews and got nervous. Upon arrival I could definitely smell chlorine quite strongly in the lobby but the indoor pool was not in an inclosed room so I expected to smell pool chemicals. There was a pitcher of ice water with fruit in it sitting on the check-in counter and a friendly face smiling at me when I approached to check in. The staff memeber was on the phone but quickly addressed me and pulled up my reservation. We were in our room within minutes of arriving to the hotel. The room was definitely nothing special but I didn't expect the Hilton for $37 a night. The room was clean, the bedding was clean, and I never saw any critters. I searched for mold because my son has a mold allergy and I didn't want to have a sick guy on our Disney vacation. However, my search turned up no mold. The carpet did seem damp when we arrived but the air conditioner was running as cold as it could so I assumed it might be from the room temperature. It seemed to dry right up after we adjusted the air conditioner to a comfortable temperature. The pools were a bit cold for my preference. I swam in both the indoor and outdoor pool. The indoor pool was so cold I couldn't stay in it but the kids loved swimming in it. The outdoor pool had plenty of lounge chairs. The kids enjoyed the \"beach\" next to the outdoor pool. We chose not to have our room cleaned during our stay. I personally don't like the idea of having people in our room when we aren't there so we hung the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door and asked the maids not to clean our room. This is something I do at most hotels because I don't want to risk that things could be misplaced. To my knowledge nobody ever went in our room. We left all of our valuable belongings sitting out and nothing was ever moved. Check out was as quick and easy as check in for us. We had no hassles. We were a bit confused by the taxes and resort fee at first but after looking it added up to the $10 per day we were expecting. I probably would stay at this hotel again but only if I got as great of a deal as we did on this trip. If I had paid the regular cost of the hotel I would probably have been more upset by the condition (broken bricks, wet carpet, noisy air conditioners, cold pools, etc.).

We were scheduled to arrive on March 14, 2012 and I had been calling the hotel since the night before. On the 13th, I called the hotel more than 20 times in a two hour span and the phone was ringing off the hook and nobody was picking up. I ended up calling Ramada's corporate office and they called the hotel and told me that it was unacceptable that they were not picking up the line and that I would be able to get through. I immediately called the hotel and the person on the line was extremely rude and obnoxious. On the scheduled day of my arrival, I tried calling all morning to let them know that I would have a late check in and again, the phone was ringing off the hook and nobody ever picked up. I ended up calling their customer care department and I filed a complaint for the lack of service on the hotel's part. I should have known by this point that this was only the begining of my nightmare. Upon arrival at the hotel, I checked in with my bank card (my husband has a separate bank card number). The next day after I checked in, I balanced my checkbook first thing in the morning (as I do every day, sometimes, numerous times in the day), and I had about $250.00 in fraudulent charges for various locations in the Tampa area (including Shell gas station, a chinese restaurant, a pizza restaurant, a clothing store and a shoe store) - all made in the Tampa area and all made after I checked in to the hotel and ALL MADE WITH MY CARD NUMBER...Upon seeing these transactions, I immediately called my bank and to dispute the charges and close my account. I have now placed an active investigation with the bank to find out who made these charges. Here's the kicker, I only used the card to check in to the hotel (which by the way they charged $40.00 for the 4 nights I stayed in resort fees) and placed a hold on my card for an additional $50.00 which I have not received back yet. This was a complete nightmare and something that NOBODY SHOULD EVERY HAVE TO GO THROUGH, ESPECIALLY WHILE ON VACATION! I urge all guests of this hotel to verify all of their purchases and to make sure that everything that is charged to them either through a credit card or their bank accounts is legal and not fraudulent activity. On a separate note, the hotel left a lot to be desired. The smell of chlorine was extremely prominent in the hotel pool and you could smell the chlorine as soon as you stepped foot into the lobby from the outside. The buffet that they offer is not appealing to the eye and extremely miserly. Not a great deal of variety for the price that they charge. You are better off going across the street to Ponderosa or Sizzler (you can get the breakfast buffet for $4.99 at both places) or IHop next door where kids eat free from 4-10 p.m. if you want to go that route. The room itself was clean, but everything was very dated. The staff is also rude and not very friendly. I requested a trolly to take my luggage up to the room and upon returning the trolly, I asked one of the front desk personnel (Mayte) if it was ok to leave the trolly in the corner. Not once did she look up even after I asked several times and her co-worker next to her had to answer on her behalf. All in all, between the incident with my credit card and the stay itself I will not be returning and I strongly urge everyone that does stay there to check their credit cards and bank accounts for fraudulent activity after staying there as well. Luckily, I think I am one of the few people who balances their checkbooks every day (several times a day) and I caught this early on before more damage was done.

Was traveling with my 3 kids and my friend and her 2 grandkids. Contacted the hotel 3 times to see if my friend and I could have rooms near each other. Got a different answer each time - 1st that I had to call the morning of my arrival, 2nd that I had to wait till I got there and then upon emailing the address on my reservation, received a response from someone named 'Wes' saying we were all set. Upon arrival, had to wait in a horrendous line to check in with only one clerk manning the front desk during the spring break season. When we finally reached the clerk and asked about the accomodations I was promised, he said that my friend's room was already assigned and there was nothing he could do. We ended up on the same floor, but at opposite ends. My friend's grandson has cerebral palsy and it was important that our rooms be close together, not only for our convenience, but also because he has great difficulty walking long distances. Upon entering the room, the first thing I saw when I turned on the light in the bathroom was a cockroach crawling on the toilet seat. Aside from that, the carpet in my room was filthy, walls dingy and overall appearance of the room so disgusting that I wouldn't allow my kids to sit on or touch anything while I called the front desk to speak to a manager. After being put on hold for 10 minutes, I spoke to the manager who said she would not penalize me if I left, but my friend, who in her opinion wasn't experiencing the same problems as me, would be charged for one night. I told her my friend's room was not much better than mine and it was ridiculous as we hadn't even been at the hotel for 15 minutes. She then reluctantly said if we left immediately we would not be charged. We then had to cut our trip short because we could only find a hotel that would accomodate us for that night and not the whole weekend. I was embarrased to have brought my friend to this hotel and in the future will stay where she recommended - Seralago Resort (a Disney Good Neighbor hotel).

This place is full of mold, probably from the indoor pool and the associated humidity. My 2nd issue--security. Anyone can walk right into the hallways from the 2nd floor staircases in spite of a sign saying \"no reentry after 6pm\". So i was assuming the doors lock behind you when you go outside using these staircases. Well--they dont. This includes the back stairways behind the building leading out to a very dark parking lot in back. Needless to say between the mold and the dark indoor room we were given with the only window looking out over the dark indoor pool area, and the knowledge that any random person from the street could be roaming around the hotels hallways, we did not sleep well. That being said, i realize that this is a budget hotel and you get what you pay for, and i truly believe the hotels mold issues are being caused by the indoor pool area. I dont know if the outside facing rooms are any better as we were only staying the 1 night and had arrived after dark and had dinner plans soon after we checked in, so we really didnt have the energy to make a fuss and change rooms. I did a thorough inspection for bugs and found none. Sheets were clean, blankets looked 10 years old down to threadbare and holes. Carpet was badly in need of replacing, bathrooms need serious updating, but again, budget hotel=budget bathrooms. I dont know what they are planning to do about the mold problem but honestly i dont see it getting any better as long as the indoor pool is there. I wouldnt stay here again. The smell from the moldy room permeated all of our clothes. I could still smell it the next night after we moved over to our timeshare condo. My advice would be--if you must stay here, request an outside facing room and keep your room door latch on. There were also no disabled parking spaces.

Many people complained about the smell of chlorine or bleach, well when a place offers and indoor pool it has chlorine in it and there is no open roof for the chlorine to escape so of course it is going to smell like chlorine. We have stayed at other hotels that offered an indoor pool and we paid 3 times the amount and it also smelled the same. Also the indoor pool contributes to some of the condition of the paint and vents. Humidity and chlorine causes metal to rust therefore the pictures of rusty vents and walls with damage come from an indoor pool. I did start to worry but now I can dismiss all the people on here who put the place down.

When we arrived we were excited to begin our vacation week. Upon arrival we were told there was no rooms available and would need to wait. 30 minutes later we received a room and headed for it. In the 30 minutes we had to kill we scouted out the indoor pool. Looked fine but as we walked around my daughter tripped near the pool. We discovered there were many loose bricks in the floor all around the pool. Dangerous for kids. When we arrived in the room we looked around and made a quick decision not to unpack. The carpet was disgusting in the room. My wife would not let the kids take their shoes off. It looked ratty and dirty. Further inspection turned up moldy ceilings, bathroom sink, mirror, floor boards, air vents, and more. The furniture was ratty and worn. Our 2 year old jumped on the bunk beds and pulled the pillow away from the wall at the head of the bed. Behind the pillow was an open power outlet! Very safe for kids??

The coridors are in desparate need of a revamp, even a lick of paint would make a huge difference. It appears from the ceiling tiles there have been some leaks, this must contribute to the damp musty smell. With the pool being in the main part of the building there is an elemnt of clorine smell around. Not brilliant whilst having breakfast. The second problem with that is people come out of the poolk and straight into the eleventors making the floors sometimes slippery. Please be mindfull if you are unsteady on your feet. Next the room, Room 7034 is an inside room facing onto the dining and pool areas. Although not the best view in town it's acceptable, being inside and with mirrored glass makes the room dark and always requireing some of the lights on. The fridge is in the base of the TV cabinet which like the table and the cabinets in the bathroom require replacing. The shower curtain rail requires fixing properly as it is curved over time it had become unscrewed and now hangs down so the curtain moves to the middle not good when the shower is at one end of the bath tub. Housekeeping., Initially yhr housekeeping was accectable but as our stay progressed it deteriated dramatically. Let me give you some examples. Dirty towels left as if they were clean ones. We requested a bed change part way through the stay, leaving as requested the \"you help the enviroment\" sign on the bed. I'm not convinved it was changed. Our room's bin had not been cleared for 3 days and room service had not been in for 2 days. We know this as the bed in particular we had left made but not fully straightened out under the main cover. In a way it was a way of checking if anything was done properly. I had to complain as to me this is not acceptable, The day I made the complaint to reception they had not been in even to replace the coffee and cups. The toilet cistern has not been wiped down for a long time as there are marks on the top and the side that we tried and could remove quite easily. In the main sleeping / sitting area the corner floor lamp hasn't been dusted, wiped or cleaned in quite some time given the film of dust / muck. It may seem that I am being very critical but these points of hotel housekeeping are just basic fundamental ones. The day I complained regarding the 2nd days none room service the excuse was that we had the do not disturbe sign on the door, even though we were out of the room by 11am each day, poor excuse for poor housekeeping. I eventually had a quick meeting with the general manager ( sorry can not remember his name) explaining my concerns and disappointments pointing out that as a regular traveler and frequent hotel guest I regularly read and write reviews for this site and others and would most definatley be putting a review on his hotel on this occasion. I did offer for him to read what I had written so far and before I was to publish it. He said no thank you and was sure that what I was about to put would be honest and true. I did also explain that the previous review of the hotle I was hoping that they would turn out to be untrue but unfortunatley not so. He agreed to give me some recompence for the poor service we had received and he said he would be speaking to the housekeeping manager that day to ensure that the problems were put right. True to his word he did and although there was some improvement and they made the pillows look all fancy etc there was still the dust, still the mucky marks in the bathroom but coffee and cups were of sufficient supply. As we were checking out the following morning early on I could not be bothered to start again. I would have thought if a hotel guest had complained they they would have made a concerted effort even just for that once. Now that rant is over I have a couple of thing to be aware of. 1, Phone calls from the room, I made 3, two of which told me that I had to put a 9 in front of the number I was dialing, these totalled each $3.77 + tax full total $13.02 and a final call to a house I could have driven to within 15 minutes door to door that cost me $11.93 total $24.95. It would have cost me a lot less to have driven it. Apparentyly 1 - 2 two towns away is long distance. 2, The bar area, we tried it one night, to us it didn't feel appealing or welcoming now maybe thats because we were the only once in but still id dint feel like a bar atmosphere again with the smell of the pool. We have both filled out the customer survey cards for the hotel and I now wonder if it is going to change in any way. Out of curiosity I will keep reading any further reviews. Would I stop at this hotel again? I very much doubt it unless there was significant improvement. As always I keep an open mind and very rarely say never again. Would I stay in another Ramada? well yes as I have in the past in USA and NZ and the UK. Some say you get what you pay for but I have been in cheaper hotels and got far better service. It's not or should not be what you pay but what you get for your money that counts. I look forward to seeing if the General Manager puts a reply on this review. I hope so for the benefit of other potential travellwers and Hotel guests. NOTE. AFTER 15 + WORKING DAYS THE DEPOSIT AND THE MONEY AS REFUND HAS STILL NOT BEEN CREDITED INTO MY ACCOUNT. It does specify that it would be after 10 working days. Positives, Great central location for all the theme parks and the I4 to go west or east although don't expect a great night life. The 192 has all the shops you need for a stay. Look around and pop into Celebration for a feel of the Desparate Housewifes. Old Town has some sort of entertainment on every night of the week. Fri & Sat Muscle car and all American car shows. Bike shows and others. Back to the hotel, The hotel bed was fantasticly comfy and the pillows just the right sort of firmness formme and my good lady. The bedroom size was good and the bathroom was of an accceptable level. Don't leave it too late for a shower or bath, water goes cool fairly early on. The amount of storage space was adequate with enough hangers for two people. Good to have an Iron and board in the room even for those tidy bag packers. TV is a good size, If youn arrive by vehicle there is adequate free parking, however durung summer or busy periods I am sure that would get tight. I hope that this review will be of use to all those people thinking of using the hotel and look forward to the comments from others and the staff concerned.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota, United States", "Title": "\u201cGet what you pay for, not all that bad!\u201d", "Author": "Shawn K", "ReviewID": "UR122110390", "Content": "We stayed for 7 nights with three kids leaving Christmas day 2011.

There was water everywhere..all in the elevator also probably from the indoor pool. What a hazard. I got in the room and it was beyond awful. Dirty sheets, nasty vents and obviously in bad need of renovation. I even opened the drawer and found a big box of crackers. The fridge wasn't even working. It was a nightmare. They moved me to another room. It was a little better..but still not clean. There was food particles on the bed post, hair and dirt every where in the bathroom. Crayons and stains on the sheets. To make matters worse, something was going on with the plumbing and something came loose in the hallway almost dripping water or some type of fluid in the hallway. Needless to say I only stayed in that room that night because I had no choice, but promptly switched hotels as soon as the sun came up.

When calling the hotel six time the person at the check in desk picked the phone up and then just hung it up. I could hear her talking before she hung up. I then called and talked with the 800 number after many tries and got booking information from them and found it to be cheapest to book online through the Ramada website. After booking I called to make sure everything was okay and was told yes I can check in anytime after 3:00 P.M. We were staying there for one night for the Mickey's not so scarey holloween party, which started at 7:00 p.m that evening. After the kids got out of school we arrived at hotel around 5:00 to find out that the reservation lady never entered our reservations into the computer even know they were made online and not with her. They said it would take 20 to 40 minutes and to come back. I told them we have four kids who need to get ready for the holloween party and we need to leave in an hour. They told us to have the kids get dressed in the public bathrooms in the lobby. Then we are told that there is also a 50 dollar fee for each room for incidents. I told them that no one I talked to and not even there website states anything about this charge. We booked two rooms and I told them that there is not enough money on card after paying for the rooms and we needed to eat while there. They then said well then we can't book you, you'll have to go somewhere else. After a brief panic attack and the people next to us having the same argument with them, they decided to only charge us 25 dollars a room. They say the hold on the charge releases when you check out, but for a debit card it can take 21 days to release. We finally get into our rooms and are sadly an hour late to the Mickey's Holloween Night. Now about the hotel rooms, food and pool. The rooms are descent expect the bed spreads were dirty, but we never sleep with them anyway. The indoor pool was heated, but not very well as kids were cold since the lobby was freezing even though it was 50 something outside. The chlorine in hot tub and pool were way too strong, they should switch to salt pool. The buffet was not good at all, the only good thing was kids 12 and under eat free. The sandwhich and pizza hut express still wasn't open at 2:00 in the afternoon and the arcade is a joke. The games take your money and no one at hotel can get it back for you and the game aren't worth the hassle anyway. My husband and I did enjoy playing pool at the tiki bar that is located right next to the indoor pool while the kids swam ( kids all twelve and older and were in plain sight). Tiki bar isn't opened till evening time which is great for families with kids that are using the indoor pool area during the morning and day. Check in and check out hours are better than most hotels and the pictures are exact to what the hotel looks like. We did have a problem with a group of handicapped adults where a woman chaperone brought one of the males into the ladies room while our teen girls were in there and he came out of stall with pants down and all showing. Yikes! the girls ran out!!!! Needs to be a sign that no males are allowed in girls bathroom!!!!!!!! They need more staff and with better personalities, except I have to say the gentlemen that checked us out was way better than the women that checked us in. For the price and indoor pool during cold months it is worth staying here. You need to check and double check your reservation. Don't use the bed spreads. Eat outside of the hotel, many places on same street. Book on priceline or one of the online booking sites because if you do then the hotel can't charge you the 50 dollar incident hold on the room. Avoid having to use the front desk women for anything. We had a late check out of 1:00 and at twelve they still shut our keys off and acted bothered when we had to get new keys. Rude rude rude rude! Last thing, when we mentioned they should put the 50 dollar hold fee on there website so people know, the manager said she would let the owner know. My husband then said, \"like that will do any good,\" and the manager said, \"No, it won't.\" If you don't have the money then this is where to stay, it is fine if you just take the advice I gave.

As it was late we didn't inspect the room until next morning. The window frame was absolutely disgusting in that it had cob webs around it and there were big gaps between it and the wall. The frame should have been condemned years ago with the look of it and who knows what might be crawling in through those gaps. The air conditioning grille was rusty and the control for the air con. was loose on the wall and sparks came from it when it fell off the wall. The bathroom door would not close and the vanity sink tap would not turn off properly (dripping all the time). The top covers on the beds had numerous cigarette burns in them even though it was supposed to be a non smoking room. The bed valance had tears in it and was fraid. As it was Saturday the hotel staff could not move us until the Monday because there were no free rooms (after looking at two other rooms they had offered but these were in no better condition). On the Monday we moved to a different room but after moving in we noticed that the carpet was wet through and the following morning were moved again because the maintenance staff wanted to find out where the carpet waqs getting wet from. The next room had a faulty safe and we had to wait a couple of days for the replacement door to be fitted for it. All around the indoor swimming pool there are floor tiles that are loose, cracked and in a dangerous condition for children to play around. I am writing this on the 27th October, 2011 with still 8 more days to put up with what I call a disgusting hotel provided by Virgin Atlantic Holidays and upon returning to England I will take this matter up with them.

One positive I have about the hotel is that the staff are very polite and did try to resolve the problems but what can they do when they haven't got the an acceptable hotel to work with.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Daytona Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBest management team n kissimmee\u201d", "Author": "ladiesheaven", "ReviewID": "UR119690266", "Content": "There no other hotel I would stay in while n kissimmee area.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFamily and budget friendly.\u201d", "Author": "travelingcatz", "ReviewID": "UR119462919", "Content": "Check-in was quick and smooth. The gentleman helping me was very friendly and accommodating to my list of requests for my room. You should note that pets are allowed at this hotel so if you have allergies be sure to mention it. I picked this hotel only because it was close to where some buddies were staying. The hotel has an indoor swimming pool and hot tub which the families seemed to enjoy. I did not expect much as the rate per night was cheap. I just hoped there were no bed bugs or cockroaches. The room needed updating and the shower did not drain. The shower was promptly fixed. The housekeeping staff did a good job keeping my room clean during my six night stay. I felt safe and everyone in the hotel was very friendly. Majority of them were families checking out the Disney Parks. The hotel offered shuttle service to Sea World and Universal Studios. The do not have shuttles to the Disney parks. The taxi ride to disney should be around USD $20.00. If you have the hotel order you a taxi, make sure it is a yellow cab and not a town car. The town car is more expensive-they charged me $30 to get to Magical Kingdom...this is day light robbery. The hotel also had free wifi. Also important to know that the hotel charges a resort fee of USD $10.00 a night. I'm not sure what that was for but I had to pay it even though I did not use their pool and breakfast was not included or a free bottle of water. There is however a grocery store across the street and a few restaurants to pick from within walking distance. Also you have a mini fridge in your room. Reminder that this is a budget hotel.

However, since they've trimmed the FREE Meal Plan down to NO TABLE SERVICE included, we \"boycotted\" staying at a Disney resort this year. Bought a Half-Off Depot 4-day/3-night stay at this Ramada for $79. Then I read the reviews and tried to prepare the family for the worst. Turns out, our fears were unfounded. We THOROUGHLY enjoyed our time at this Ramada! Although we had to pay the $10 per day hotel service charge/Disney shuttle fee, we never used it since we drove to Florida. But we also only spent one day at a Disney park this year (A.K.) and decided to explore more of the Orlando area with the rest of our days & nights. This turned out very well and our 3 boys (10,10, 8) also enjoyed Disney Quest, Green Meadows Petting Farm, Dave & Buster's, Outlet Shopping and the freedom to eat wherever we wanted instead of feeling the pressure of stuffing ourselves at Disney buffets... PROS: Cheap stay, saved HUNDREDS over staying at Disney; in-room mini refrig (Disney charges extra for this at Value Resorts); FREE Wi-Fi throughout the resort and easy to connect; CLEAN Indoor Pool & Hot Tub (our boys LOVED this & we visited the pool/tub 6 times); 3 beds for 3 children & 2 TVs in our Family Fun Suite; nice location in what our boys nicknamed \"Little Vegas\" for all the lights on the strip at night; our room overlooked the pool/restaurant area; FREE USA TODAY every morning in the lobby; the clean aroma of Chlorine/Bleach from the moment we walked into the resort; kids eat free at the buffet; our maid was exceptional and we tipped her daily. CONS: Didn't take a blow dryer because the rooms have one and of course ours didn't work (but we lived without it); spent 5 minutes cleaning the in-room coffee maker that contained dirty water before noticing the on/off switch on the front bottom was missing (D'oh!); the 2 tv remotes would sometimes control both tvs at the same time when that wasn't desired (but this is really a minor complaint). Obviously the specific room you get will greatly influence your experience at this (or any) resort....Our expectations were set very low and since nearly everything exceeded them while being an extremely affordable stay, this Ramada earned 5-stars with us...", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cWorth the stay!\u201d", "Author": "angelahag", "ReviewID": "UR118664062", "Content": "My Husband and two Son's (19 and 22) were at a ball tournament and stayed here.

I think no matter where you stay you can find fault in a hotel, but over all the guys had no complaints and for the money you can't beat $33 a night for 2 queen beds with a refridge! They loved the deep outdoor pool, plenty of cable channels, comfy beds oh and I can't forget the arcade :) I think of it this way...as long as the room is bearable, that just leaves you extra money to do other things especially while in Orlando.

This hotel offers rates as low as $35 per night and the service is way beyond this price. The room was meticulously cleaned and a great size. My family and I ate breakfast at the buffet style restaurant every morning during our stay and I must say that the restaurant employees were wonderful. I have to give special mention to Yissel and another woman (I didnt get her name, but I do know she has been working there for 20+ years). They were just so nice, it was a breath of fresh air. The food at the restaurant was very low priced and tasty too! My family and I had so much fun in the indoor pool, located right near the restaurant. There were also several other families there that were all having an excellent time. The hotel is conveniently located about a mile away from all the Disney Parks, which was awesome because we could wake up, take our time getting ready and take a short drive to Disney vs. having to wake up in a rush to take the park shuttle. The hotel also offers an outdoor pool, gym, bar and pizzahut express, which we unfortunately did not have time to take advantage of. The one and only negative comment I have is regarding the front desk staff. They could definitely have been a lot nicer to the guests. I'm not saying I was treated bad per se, but there was no eye contact or smiling involved in my check-in or check-out and thats something that I feel is neccessary for a person to really feel welcome at an establishment. All in all, we had a fabulous stay at the Ramada Maingate West.

On return from a restaurant one night to find a large cock roach under the duvet cover just wouldn't cut it with my girlfriend! So with very little hassle we were moved to another room. They are so used to moving people around they don't even put up any resistance. The new room is better, but still damp in the bathroom, loose bathroom wall tiles and mouldy silicone around the bath seems to be the norm. Wouldn't give this place a three star, two at best.

I wanted to make sure I wrote a review for this hotel. Let me start off by saying I\u2019m somewhat hard to please, I take customer service very seriously, and I\u2019m very detailed oriented. Let\u2019s just say, I see it all AND I\u2019ve seen it all. With that being said, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only complaints that I have are minute. I didn\u2019t like that there were kids all over the place. At night, they stayed in the Jacuzzi past the cut off time of 9 pm. One morning, a foreigner put her panties in the microwave and set off the fire alarm in the entire hotel. Also, I think that the music at the outside pool could have been much louder. I had to strain to hear what they were playing at 12 o\u2019clock noon. I was on vacation and wanted to feel like that. I felt more like I was in an elevator, than on vacation laying out by the pool in 90 degree weather. See, miniscule issues. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, they\u2019re food, drinks, and most of all Karaoke. I will never forget the \u201cHey there Delilah\u201d rendition that one of the guys staying there, offered up. Hilarious stuff!!! I did not see any mold, roaches, or bedbugs. Nothing! And I have stayed in a bug infested hotel before. Not fun at all. This hotel, the room was meticulously cleaned. I did have to call and have them come and change our bed linen b/c there was black streaks on the sheet and pillow. Housekeeping was there in a heartbeat and changed everything that was on that bed, not just the stained sheet. Everything. Housekeeping was so on top of it, the next day they literally begged to clean the room by knocking on the door every hour and a half. I finally had to get up and go to the pool and get some sun. Hey, at least they wanted to clean. I loved that checkout was so late, I think 12 noon. You can\u2019t beat that. I must say, I was like most of you. I was so worried about staying here because of the horrible reviews and reputation. We were part of Bahamas Celebration and got to stay at one hotel before the cruise and one hotel after the cruise. We could not choose. I am so happy with the Ramada Maingate West that, I would stay here again all on my own. The other hotel we stayed at was horrible and they have a negative review coming their way. This Ramada has a pizza hut, tiki bar, karaoke, restaurant, gift shop, bar, exercise room, etc. What else can you ask for? They are also in a perfect location. Close to everything. If you want 5 stars, go stay at Disney. If you want convenience and an economical choice, choose Ramada Maingate West.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Maingate West", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d80376-Reviews-Ramada_Maingate_West-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$44 - $73*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7491 West Hwy 192</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34747</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "80376", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3a/90/3a909c9fef9198ba47894514fedfdc916large.jpg"}}

With the suspicious people, drug dealers, cops outside every weekend, and shoddy security, it's a hellhole. Probably the worst place I've lived in yet!

This is the scariest hotel I have ever stayed in and I have traveled a bit for work I am not on the first floor and can hear the yelling over my television-its THAT bad. I can't imagine staying here with children. This place tells you the office is open 24 hours a day and they have good security-NOT. Tried calling the office tonight-no answer, walked down there and it is closed. The thugs have the place until daylight. I am going to offer the courtesy of a warning to fellow travelers- I wish someone had warned me!!! Leaving to tomorrow and no they do not refund-no security no refund.

From the Keith the head valet to Melvin the bellhop to the front desk staff, everyone was extremely courteous, professional and helpful. Check in was seamless. The room was very nice and clean (definitely request a harbor view). One especially nice touch was the ultra modern bathroom with a glass shower big enough for two (oolala!) The hotel is accessible via an above street walkway to the Harbor as well as the Convention Center. We were at the epicenter of everything in downtown Baltimore so all the restaurants at the harbor, Convention center, Camden Yards and the Aquarium are all within walking distance. Nothing was more than a 10-15 minute walk. We took in a show at 1st Mariners and it was a $4.00 cab ride. Check out was quick via a invoice that I was emailed with barcode to scan at a kiosk. The whole process to about 3 minutes. In the morning on the way out I highly recommend the pineapple fiz in the lobby. All in all this was an excellent top tier experience. Ok if I had to say anything bad about the stay was that I was kind of shocked by the prices at the gift shop (I paid $11 for 2 bottles of water) but I suppose that\u2019s to be expected. Anything you need is a 10 minute walk over to the harbor.

Overall, this was a very good stay. The location can't be beat (walking distance to the Aquarium, Port Discovery, restaurants, etc) and the hotel itself was very clean. All the staff were very friendly and said \"hi\" to us in the halls or wherever we ran into any of them. I shelled out a little more to get the Regency Club perks. We were first placed on the Regency Club floor (12th floor) in room 1220. Being a Platinum Hyatt member, they gave us a great harbor view room. Unfortunately, there were frat guys next door who were wrestling (sounded like they were throwing eachother off the walls) and loud music playing so we I had to call the front desk and asked to be moved. They moved us right away to the other side of the hotel (room 1230) and although it wasn't the harbor view, it was MUCH quieter, which was good for our baby who needs his naps in the room. I asked for a pack n play but one wasn't there so I called the front desk again and they brought it up instantly. Great service. The only glitch on our stay was our disappointment with the Regency Club. At check-in, I was given a paper with all the perks of the Club and what times the drinks were being served, etc, but when I had gone in there in the afternoon and early evening for a quick finger food bite, most of the food was not replenished and there was barely anything to eat. The drinks were supposedly being served (cash bar) between 8pm-9pm and I walked in at 8:30pm to grab a beer and noted that there was no one there. I waited around until 9pm but ended up leaving to grab a bite and a drink downstairs at the Bistro 300 restaurant (which by the way, the bar tender was excellent). The following morning we went into the Regency Club lounge for breakfast and it was pretty decent. There was someone there to refill the food and it was also nice having access to free bottled water and soda at anytime we want. Was the lounge as great as advertised? No, it definitely needs improvement, but overall, it was satisfactory. So even with the slight glitch of the Regency Club, why did I give it 5 stars? Well, couple of days after we got back from our stay, I got an email asking for a feedback/survey of our stay. I said pretty much the same thing about the Regency Club and a day later, I got a personal email from the Hyatt management apologizing and awarded me bonus 5,000 points on my Goldpass. Now that's customer service and a true reflection of Hyatt standards. I don't even care about the points. Just the fact that someone took the time to write me a personal email apologizing, that would've still been good enough to get 5 stars in my book. The points, I'll use it right back at another Hyatt this summer for our stays, so it doesn't matter, but it's little things like this is what separates Hyatt from other hotels. It made me feel very proud to be a Hyatt Platinum member and will definitely be back to this hotel very soon.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn, AL", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "auburn8", "ReviewID": "UR127102989", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at this hotel this weekend while attending a conference at the hotel. We absolutely loved the location, between the shopping, restaurants, aquarium and other sights of the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards. This hotel is typical of the quality I expect from the Hyatt Regency chain. Even though we arrived late check-in was a pleasant experience. The late night staff were very friendly and sped us through the process efficiently. Our room was decently sized and had a modest view of the harbor and of Federal Hill. The TV was a nice sized flat screen. There were plenty of electrical outlets conveniently placed for charging phones and lap tops. The bed was quite comfortable with a nice selection of pillows. Temperature control was a little uneven but was acceptable. The bath room only had a shower which might be a little disconcerting for people who like a bath but it was large and worked very well. The toilet's handle can only be reached if you put the lid down and that is somewhat awkward. Also, when we brushed our teeth our first night the drain plug in the sink was shut. The lever to unplug it is very small and is located at the back, bottom of the spigot where it is very difficult to find. Another thing that was a little annoying was that they ask us to be \"green\" and reuse our towels but there is only one small place to hang a towel up. They have a very nice fitness center and a roof top pool that was not yet open for the season. The lobby area, the meeting rooms, and the restaurant are all quite nice.

Doing the late night drive back to Fredericksburg after the show seemed crazy to us so we booked a room at the Hyatt Regency. Everything about our stay was just a positive experience, beginning with Mr. Taylor at the front desk. He was courteous, professional, had great wit and a winning smile. We threw him a couple curve balls (i.e., room request and credit card requirements) and he handled each one perfectly. When asked if we could speak to the manager on duty, he made it clear that it was in no way an issue and he would be glad to assist. The manager was equally as professional answering all questions!!! As a side note, our conversation with the manager was not the result of any problem in terms of our reservation. Room was great. We stayed in a Respire room which is a hypo-allergenic room. Wow, what a difference that made. I have allergies and typically find myself waking up congested and tired when I stay at a hotel. This time when I woke up I didn't have the need to hop into a steaming shower just to breath. The bed was comfortable, room was spotless, and I loved the bathroom design. I would say it was about average size with plenty of storage area/cabinets and a work area. All electronics/lights/temperature control/Wi-Fi were in working order. Although the hotel has many really cool features, the glass elevator was awesome. You can look out over the Inner Harbor and at night it is pretty spectacular!! As an FYI, parking is not free to hotel guest (we knew that). I believe it was either $28 or $32 for the evening. Poor planning on our part as we came in separate vehicles.

Unfortunately doesn't connect directly to hotel so have to go outside to get in the hotel, but not too bad so long as your not carrying a lot. Lobby and lounge/fitness etc is very nice.

After looking at several hotels, we chose the Hyatt Regency because of it's location to both the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards. We are so happy we chose this hotel. It was about $30 more when compared to other hotels, but it was definitely worth the extra money. It is conveniently located only a few blocks from I-95 so you don't have to worry about getting lost in the city! We arrived on a Friday morning in August at around 10:30 a.m. and used the self-parking. We were greeted at the front door by the bellman who opened the door for us. There was no line at the front desk and we were greeted by Adam. He was very helpful and friendly. We were able to check-in immediately. Adam also charged the parking ($27...this seemed to be the same at other hotels) to our room so we could avoid the self-service machines. We were on the 14th floor and were given a corner room. This room was significantly larger than the other rooms. However, we didn't have a view of the harbor. No big deal, we weren't in the room that long anyway. The room had a desk/chair, table/chairs, a chaise lounge, mini-bar and big flat screen t.v. The bed was comfy and air-conditioning worked well. The bathroom was small, but served its' purpose. There were floor-to-ceiling windows, but as I said, no view of the harbor. There is one casual restaurant on-site which is open for breakfast. In the afternoon, the bar opens and then the restaurant re-opens for dinner. There is a small place to grab coffee and a bagel/croissant/muffin, etc... for a quick breakfast. There is also a small gift shop located next to the coffee place. The best part about this hotel is the location. If you walk out the side doors on the second floor, you can take the Skywalk right over to the Inner Harbor. There was even security stationed on the walkway at night so it was safe at any time of day. Camden Yards is only a few blocks away and very easy to walk to. We really enjoyed visiting Baltimore and wished we could have stayed longer as there is so much to do. We definitely plan to return to Baltimore and would without a doubt, choose the Hyatt Regency.

While the office I was visiting was far from central Baltimore, wanted to stay in the Inner Harbour area as I'd never been to the City. The hotel is extremely well located, within walking distance of just about anything you'd want to see in the Inner Harbour area. While everything was clean and staff was extremely courteous and helpful, the hotel had a worn out, tired look to it. I just recently visited a friend who was staying at a Hyatt in my home city and got the same impression. Don't know if there's a pattern there, but at least with the two I've visited recently, seems like Hyatts need some serious updating. Room was large, clean with a nice bathroom although I found the amenities a little thin. Walls were on the thin side---could hear conversation of family with kids next door. I hate adjoining room doors in any hotel room and my room had one but it was well secured. Given proximity to the National Aquarium, there seemed to be lots of families with lots of kids and the hallways were somewhat loud at times. Not the hotels fault, but perhaps they could have a quiet floor for those who are on work, rather than a pleasure trip. Also on the negative side----the coffee maker had missing parts. I didn't bother calling the front desk but this shouldn't happen at any hotel. The tv, while nice, big flat screen, was thin on channels, except for all types of ESPN channels you would ever want. Room service was excellent in both delivery time, service and quality of food. I booked through Priceline and paid $75 per night so absolutely no complaints as to price and overall, happy with the hotel. However, if I wasn't booking through Priceline, not sure I'd choose the Hyatt.

After 1 1/2 hours waiting we were finally given our room which was a small suite with a semi harbor view. Which was fine. The next day the fun started. You have to have your key to get up in the elevators and I forgot mine MY BAD! I went to the desk and asked for a new one. The front desk clerk Adam said since the room was in my husbands name i could not have a new key made even with id. He should of sent someone up with me and i could verify something in the room but he just said no and that i would have to wait until my husband came from his conference at 6 o'clock and 4 blocks away to get into the room to get in the room. .. Be prepared to have the clerks be totally unhelpful and our right obstructionists! . Finally after a temper fit the manager was called and he said it was ok to give me a new key. It was my mistake to leave the key in the room but it should have been resolved like most hotels do it . #1 The first key didn't work in the lounge which is nice to get water and cokes.. #2 I went back down and got the key re-keyed.

I was pleased with the room, and the cleaning ladies were really kind, however the hotels pool is really tiny, the gym had flies flying around in it, and the hot tub was shallow and just for two people. I'm am not too sure how up to date it was either. The hotels lobby looks nice, but if you are planning to enjoy the hotels amenities then you'll be dissapointed. Also, you have to use your room key to go to a floor on the elevator. Alot of times it doesn't work or the elevator starts moving, and it passes your floor, etc. Alot of people on the elevator were annoyed by this. Mine didn't work at all and I was on the way to the gym, and got stuck going to the lobby. I just went ahead and asked them to fix my card instead of taking the stairs, but I didn't have my id on me. The woman at the front desk then said she would call a security guard to escort me to my room to get my id. I was really upset by this. She then changed her mind, probably because she could see how unhappy I was, and just called the room to talk to my boyfriend to verify that I was who I said I was. This is not a nice enough hotel to be so up tight. I didn't complain, because I'm sure that's she was just doing her job and that's just thier policy, but it's a bad policy to have. It is DEFINITELY NOT worth paying the full price, especially after they nickle and dime you for everything. Internet is $20, but they have another type of internet they offer that, if you exceed a certain bandwidth, they will dissconnect you for $10. Parking is $27. Also, Instead of giving you a fridge they give you a mini bar. Don't plan on keeping any leftovers. Luckily, I used hotwire and payed little to stay here. I stayed at the aloft (three star) in the bwi hotel district before and the staff was way friendlier, everything was much more updated, and their internet was free.

There was a high school prom being thrown there this particular Saturday night. Late in the evening, the noise level became very loud with intoxicated high school students scouring around the hotel. Since it was well after midnight and we were in bed, we felt it was too late to request a room change. The thinness of the walls and poor construction of the hotel contributed to the noise problem. The bathroom was nice, and the room was of a sufficient size. There was nothing very comfortable about it, though. The expectedly expensive parking, pay wireless internet, average room, and noise problem made this stay unpleasant.

The housekeeper Chantay was very friendly and did a wonderful job refreshing my room while I was out at the Inner Harbor. She even wrote me a sweet note thanking me for the tip. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was nice. There were only two issues I dealt with while I was there... first one is a preference, I like a hotel hairdryer attached to the wall for convenience and cleanliness. The one they had was underneath the sink on a shelf and did not feel like it was cleaned very often. The other issue was that I put one of the large bottles of water in the fridge that was on the table and a flyer was left instructing me not to place things in the fridge. I called down to get a fridge so I could have my $5 bottle of water cold but they never brought me one even though they said they would. Neither issues were a big deal just little things that I would fix if I were the manager. There should be room left in the fridge for a guests bottle of water or an additional guest fridge.

As I said in the title, the location here is great. It was a short walk over the bridge to the harbor, leading right to restaurants and shops and plenty to do. But without the location, things go downhill pretty quickly. Its not that the hotel wasn't nice, because it certainly was decent. It just wasn't nice like a usual Hyatt would be. I find it odd that the Hyatt in the mid-sized upstate NY city where I live is truly in a higher class than the Hyatt in a world-class city like Baltimore. There were just a multitude of odd things combining to make this not a 4-star experience. To be fair, let me first mention a few positives about this hotel though: The fitness room was definitely four-star quality. In addition, so were the bell-hops/valet guys. They couldn't have been nicer. I can only assume the front desk staff was of the same quality, though with the kiosk for checking in I didn't even need to talk with them. Now, let's get to the real issues this hotel has: 1)The parking garage elevator dumps you off at the bottom of a long ramp outside the hotel entrance. So, after paying $28 to park per day, you still have to walk uphill, outside just to get to the hotel? Sorry, but I'm used to garage elevators at nice hotels actually taking me to the hotel! 2)Only internet option available: wireless via T-Mobile available to buy by the day. Yes, it is tacky to charge, but that's not even my beef here, since I know for some odd reason the current trend is for \"prestigious\" hotels to charge for internet, whilst lesser \"value\" options give you free access. The real issue here is lack of a secure wired connection. This wireless-only option basically eliminates serious business travelers from using this hotel. 3)Maybe I'm a geek, but the first thing I do when I get to a hotel room is read the little guide-book for the hotel itself. The guidebook for the Hyatt in Baltimore looks like it was written by someone who had probably never set foot in the Baltimore Hyatt. It had very little detailed information about anything, with the exception of the cringe-inducing pricing of the room-service menu. 4)One word: Pisces. A much whispered about roof-top \"event venue\" that you can't miss seeing signs to in the elevators, yet appears to be entirely private and for rentals only (This I only determined afterward, since there was literally no written word about it in the previously mentioned guidebook!). If part of your hotel is strictly for non-hotel guests, please have a separate entrance for it. I spent the whole week thinking I was missing out on something. 5) Continuing the design flaws first mentioned in number one: the bridge to the harbor, while a good idea, is strangely hidden off the far side of the 2nd floor of the hotel. So I can almost guarantee everyone going to the harbor from the hotel will miss this bridge during their first trip to the harbor. In fact, it is so poorly designed, that when returning to the hotel via the bridge, you will walk through the registration tables for whatever conference is going on at the hotel! Not to mention, the fact that the bridge is so far out of the way no doubt contributes to the problem of it being a mecca for the homeless. One was curled up with a book reading or napping next to a garbage can one evening when my wife and I were returning from the harbor! At least the homeless are well-read here. Additional security concerns I would note are the entrances and elevators to the hotel: while the elevator plainly states you need your room key to access the 4th-14th floors, we came and went at all hours and never once had to use the swipe card to get to the 14th floor! Never had to swipe to get into the hotel either, regardless of time or entrance chosen. Kind of scary in hindsight. Last but not least, warm bottled water waiting for you every day above the mini-bar... Did I really see \"$5\" written in tiny lettering on the card attached to each bottle? I feel awful for anyone who accidentally drank one of those!

They had no health-consious options on their menu so I stuck with soup: - For lunch, before my meetings, I ordered Chicken tortilla soup. I requested it without the tortilla strips on top. They said it didn't come with tortilla strips on top. It arrived with tortilla strips on top. I mentioned it was wrong, but did not explicitly ask for a new bowl, so of course they didn't offer. I ate it anyway. The chicken was awful: sauteed chicken breast with italian seasoning (in mexican soup??) cut up and mixed in as an after thought. Not tasty at all, and not a good flavor combination. - For dinner, I ordered chicken noodle/mazo ball soup. I have had this soup from the Hyatt in Chicago before and it was amazing. This was horrible, and the chef should go take lessons from their Chicago twin. Guess what? It had the SAME (exact) leftover seasoned, sliced up chicken breast in it, also thrown on top of the soup as an after thought. It ruined the flavor, and there were no vegetables in the soup except for one piece of uncooked carrot. Also, the gentleman who brought me my food was completely taken aback that I asked him to take the lunch tray with him when he left. He tried to get me to leave it outside the door... which might have been fine on a different day, but not this day. Also, the internet has been frustrating me all night. I have to connect via a VPN for work, but they do not have an option for higher bandwith for advanced application users. So my VPN keeps timing out, and I can't watch my slingbox because there' s just not enough juice. I don't mind this when the internet is free, but here it is not free. Perhaps tomorrow will be better (I'm here for two more nights), but since I am stuck wishing I had gone out to eat and bored because I can't do work or use advanced computer applications, this hotel gets a mediocre review. My preference from now on is going to be the Baltimore Marriott Waterside. Have not had a bad experience there yet (they even usually offer me the town car back to the airport), and I just can't imagine getting that kind of service here.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in the 80's style\u201d", "Author": "Quintillian", "ReviewID": "UR85625226", "Content": "Great location in what is really a rather dull place.

BAD - On the same line as above, the hotel was very undistinguished and could be any other generic business hotel. - Rooms are pricey. My conference rate was $200 but normal rate was around $350. You can stay about 2 blocks farther away for half the price. - Facility restaurants are also VERY expensive, so I ate every meal over by the waterfront (ex. Cheesecake factory). - No free wireless. - Spotty room service, never cleaned up my ice bucket or provided new bags for ice.

We found our room physically uncomfortable to spend time in because there was no soft seating and although the bed looked very comfortable it was anything but.

I had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view. On arrival they gave us a room on the 7th floor (there are 14), with a direct view of the backside of the convention center and alley. I called and spoke with hotel staff who said she could transfer us to a Harborview at no charge on the 14th floor. She said our luggage would be waiting in our new room when we came back from the aquarium, and offered a complimentary bottle of champagne to be delivered at 9pm and left in the room if we weren't back from dinner. This seemed very nice, and I was impressed. However, 3 hours later after the aquarium, when I explained this to the evening staff, they had to search the database to find a room that was on the 11th floor and half the size of our original room...it was very claustrophobic! We got up there and our luggage was not there either. So I called down again. The evening staff was courteous and offered to show us a room with more space on the 6th floor, but had 2 double beds. This is NOT what we wanted for our anniversary, but at that time, he said the entire hotel was full and checked in, and there were no other queen/king beds available. Disappointed, we accepted the other room (which did have a nice view), but then had to wait for our luggage to be brought up and missed our dinner reservations. Finally, we went to get dinner later than expected and on return at 10pm, there was no complimentary champagne waiting as had been offered. We ended up sleeping in separate beds (on our anniversary) because the double beds were so small, and neither of us got any rest. Overall the entire experience was disappointing, and I regret booking an anniversary evening at the Hyatt. I do not understand why a nicer room was not saved for us when we had requested it. Furthermore, if they wanted to help compensate for this and move us to a nicer room, why did they offer one on the 14th floor with complimentary champagne, then not follow through?

There is a parking lot attached to the garage (valet or self-park). Parking cost us $27, but this is a downtown city, so not bad when we split the cost. Check-in was fast and the front desk very friendly. We even got to check-in a few hours early. We visited the National Aquarium, which was terrific; don't miss the 4-D movie, which costs extra but worth it for the amusement park thrill effects (they have attraction-type movies at Universal Studios and Disney too). We did the Inner Harbor tourist walking and shopping on day two. The Hyatt room is fabulous--very comfortable beds with luxury bedding and pillows. This IS a Hyatt Regency after all. The room has a nice LCD TV, a mini bar, and spacious bathroom which was very clean (I hate mold on bathroom tiles). Since we were in Baltimore for one night, we had dinner at the Rusty Scupper (B+) and dessert at the Bistro 300 (inside the Hyatt). It was raining all day and night (perfect for being indoors at the Aquarium), so we took a taxi to the restaurant ($5 way). The buffet breakfast the next morning was very good, especially since they will cook you an egg omelet to order (included in the buffet price). Being \"free\", it was worth it--even if they don't have any desserts (danish and some pastries, but no cake). Luckily, the second day was hot and sunny so we took a Water Taxi ($9 per person for all day access) to Fells Point. After walking for an hour, we headed back to the Inner Harbor. Fells Point is a waste of time, unless you like musty bars and bums, but we wanted to check it out because a friend told us it has \"atmosphere\" (so does Mars, but you can't breathe there without choking). The Hyatt layout and staff are very accommodating -- the lobby is 3 floors, fun to explore and sit on sofas, watching the crowds across the street at the Harborplace.

If you are lucky enough to get a harbor view room you'll love the view. It is expensive to be sure, but almost every hotel in that area is (especially when the Red Sox or Yankees are in town). Worth it? Probably not, but you won't find many bargains that offer similar amenities, service and location. I'll try not to be too windy on this review so here goes... Pros: Location, location, location!, including a foot bridge over the street to the Inner Harbor shops. Excellent & friendly service (except for housekeeping). Flat screen HD TV with swivel base so you can view from anywhere in the room. Long multi-sectional low ottoman against the windows to sit and enjoy the view. Comfortable beds. Perfect amount of white noise from the A/C and good temperature control. Fast responding glass elevators. Large in room safe. Strong flush toilets & good shower. Portable phone. Individual cup coffee maker. Cons: Parking is outrageously expensive if you use the hotel's valet/self park. The \"Do Not Disturb\" sign is very hard to find (it's a very tiny gray card in a plastic sleeve behind the door bar). We were awakened several times by housekeeping until we found it while getting ready to check out. Housekeeping must not have liked us either because our room was not made up timely nor was it properly restocked. Exterior noise was a definite concern. Small closet with few hangers. Small bathroom. Poor lighting. Yes there are several cons, material ones at that, but I can say from experience that almost all of the Inner Harbor area hotels have these problems and many more. It is above average for the AREA it is in, not by world traveler standards, where it would only be average.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaufort, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cOK - nothing special\u201d", "Author": "ctcomanchepilot", "ReviewID": "UR16822703", "Content": "We spent the weekend of May 30-Jun1 here on a baseball trip.

Like: My room had not been thoroughly dusted, the desk was dusty, the lampshades were crooked. The coffee bar was not open one morning, then open the next day. I use a wheelchair and stayed in an accessible room, but it appeared that the room isn't used much (see above dusting comment). Rooms were not made up until very late (5:30) in the afternoon. I paid a conference rate for the room, which made the value OK, but if I paid full rate I would say that it would not be worth it.

If they can address those small things, the hotel would be a much better experience. My one pet peeve, not just with the Hyatt, but most hotels...

When the maid re-stocked my bathroom supplies, she left four bottles of shower gel, but failed to replenish the body lotion I'd used the night before. There was no turn-down service without formally requesting it, and my toilet even malfunctioned (although it was promptly repaired). After a day of sightseeing, we went to the bar about 5pm one afternoon. No bartender was on a duty, and a hapless but well-intentioned bus boy attempted to make our drinks, but botched 'em. (Eventually, an apologetic bartender did show up.) When I was ready to check out, the highly touted \"in room video checkout\" malfunctioned, and when I tried to check out via the computer terminals in the lobby, they were out-of-order, too. Some of these complaints may seem minor, but you certainly wouldn't encounter them at a Four Seasons or a Rosewood property. Unfortunately, neither company has a hotel in Baltimore.

We checked in Friday night to a room that smelled and was not cleaned so we were \"upgraded\". The new room was fine at first glance but then we noticed other problems - the air didn't work properly so although the thermostat said \"60\" (yes - i had to put the temp that low to even feel a hint of cool air) the vent was still blowing out warm air. The bed was a rock and the sheets were too starchy. The doors rattled as if someone were knocking whenever someone walked by which kept us up throughout the night. Speaking of which - the walls are paper thin...you hear everything. The shower drain didn't work so we had to shower in a pool of dirty water. Then to top it off the hotel pumps some god-awful air freshner that smells like some musty old basement. So - trying to leave?! Everyone and I mean everyone was trying to get out of that hotel at the same time. It took us 30 minutes just to move our car from our parking spot in the garage to the guy in the booth to pay.

My wife, my 13 yr. old and I visited on Christmas day for 2 nights and I was concerned about negative reviews. I had booked a travelzoo rate(about $50 less than the website's posted Christmas week rates, which are low for this location to begin with. The hotel had light traffic our two nights and this probably helped us from experiencing some of the negatives in other reviews. The entry lobby is a bit dissapointing and they need to add a restroom at this level. But doormen were friendly and check in was a breeze. The T-Zoo rate did not specify a view room from a non-view room, which was $40 additional on the websites non Tzoo rate. So, I was going to ask for a view room and was pleasantly surprised when this was offered up front. Our 10th floor room was off a very pleasant lobby done in tan shades. It is the same cookie cutter size of most big box hotels(i.e.-on the small side) but was opened up nicely by wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows, a setee that runs wall to wall by the window to allow sitting and observing the spectactular view of the harbor, and a large handsome mirror that dominates the center of the room. A full closet with regular hangers and a safe, a 32\" flat screen TV and an I-POD station were nice extras. There is an honor bar w/o key that we stayed away from. Two double size beds were terrifically supportive(ie-firm)with a nice pillowtop to give it a cushy feeling. The room was done in shades of off-white with touches of gold, and color supplied by 3 modern prints on the wall. A modern, clean look! The bathroom is on the small side, but contains a freestanding counter with towels on bottom shelves, again emphasizing modernity. Fixtures are nice but not grand, and I did not care for the low toilet seat. Color came from inlaid small tile octangles above counter and in shower. Portico toiletries thrilled me, not my wife or son. Two of the four glass enclosed elevators were up and running. Since they rise thru a 3 story atrium(set above entry floor) to outside the hotel with views towards the harbor, and they are beautifully lit a night, they are part of the fun. The atrium restaurant was nicely turned out-the breakfast buffet good but not spectactular. They are still re-doing restrooms on the 1st floor of the atrium(2 cnd fl) where there is a business center, gift shop and coffee bar. What really surprised us was the friendliness of the staff thru-out the hotel and the prompt service we got when we had special requests.

Front desk personnel were pleasant and efficient. Concierge was very helpful in trying to find a restaurant for me, but it was raining and late so I opted for room service (french onion soup which was very tasty, and a Cobb salad, which was not as good). My room 541, was at the end of the hall and uniquely shaped. Because it was on a corner it had a long hallway in the room to get to the sleeping area. Bed was very comfortable, shower was large enough for two people comfortably and was an pleasing marble with blue accent tile line. Only bad thing was the handle on the door to the shower was too small to grasp from the inside, and the way the shower is designed you can't turn on the water without being partially IN the shower and so COLD water hits you before you can turn the knob to warm. The room is unique not only is it's shape but in that three of the four walls of the room are all glass floor to ceiling! Since the hotel is nicely located near the water and harbor area the view was engaging and almost surround although there were some office buildings on one side of the view. I totally enjoyed the glass walls, but it did make it so I had to turn up the heat at night, and I did hear street noise in the morning. The elevator was shaped like an arrow and all glass as well. The a/c system was apparently piping out some freshly scented freshner because it was the first thing I noticed getting off the elevator. Wish I could replicate that at home! Their fine dining restaurant was closed oddly enough (it was only 8pm) so I can't comment on it. All in all I would definitely stay here again and recommend it.

We live in Harford County, MD, so we're only about 20-30 min from Baltimore's Inner Harbor - we've taken many day trips there and have always enjoyed all the Harbor has to offer. This was one of the only overnighters we've had there recently, and we specfically booked a room at the Hyatt because of its reputation - I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed with certain aspects of the hotel. Check-in was quick and simple - we provided the front desk with our confirmation number, I.D. and a credit card and were assigned a room on the spot. (We checked-in on 12/30 for two nights, as we had dinner reservations at Flemings the first evening - which we HIGHLY recommend! Awesome service, food, etc etc!) The room was described to us as a \"Queen room with a Harbor view\". We were in #702 - a small, triangular, oddly laid out space. The amenities in the room itself were fabulous - a huge, beautifully tiled showed (big enough for two) and a modern looking vanity unit in the bathroom; marble-topped furniture and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in (although my boyfriend and I both agreed - it was NOT a full queen size, as we have a queen sized bed in our own home) with down pillows and a down comforter. But the room itself was a weird shape, and the furniture felt packed-in - straight ahead after walking in was a large desk, to the right was the mini-bar (which you couldn't open all the way, as the door would hit the desk leg), to the left was the bed, set an an angle with about two feet of room from the foot of the bed to the dresser (the TV was on top of the dresser). The flat screen TV was grainy (lacking HD) and automatically reset itself to an \"OnCommand\" menu every time it was shut off - after attempting to use a \"Free 5 minute preview\" of the TV's music service, without pushing anything we ended up ordering it for $9.99 for only two hours! (Note: When we called the front desk to ask about the music service, the girl replied \"Um I think it's for 24 hours but I really don't know\" - way to educate the staff...)(Somehow our bill was charged 4 times for the music service...refer to my check-out comments). Movies were grossly overpriced at at least $10.99 a piece, although if you were looking to see something that wasn't available on DVD yet, you could most likely find it here. Basically, if you're electronically inept (which the hotel is obviously hoping for), you'll end up spending a whole heap of money just off the TV. Oh yes, and the lovely little remote stopped working halfway through our stay. We had an entire wall of large windows that more or less looked out over the hotel itself and at the windows on the other side (if you look at how the hotel is \"V\"-shaped, you'll see what I mean), but we did have an angular view of the harbor and the adjoining mall. The room had its own digital thermostat, which was great but set up a bit oddly - if you turned the temp up, the heat triggered on, but if you tried to just turn the head down, the A/C clicked on. We did sleep in a bit on New Year's Eve, and did not leave the room until around 2:00PM. The maids were servicing other rooms on our floor, so we removed our \"Privacy Please\" sign and left the hotel. We arrived later that evening only to find our room as we had left it - disheveled bed, dirty towels and all. I called the front desk to request new towels - when the maid came to the door, she only handed me two large towels, though I had asked for a full set. When I asked if she had any small towels, she said \"I doubt it\" and brought me back one of each smaller size. How does a hotel that large not have an abundance of clean towels on hand?? I also ended up with a monster of a blister from some heels that had not been broken in yet - when I called the front desk to ask for a band-aid, I was a bit surprised to find that you had to purchase them from the Gift Shop, which was already closed. (The next day I bought an 8-pack of crappy travel band-aids for $1.99.) On New Year's Eve, my boyfriend and I attempted to get into Bistro 300, the smaller of the two restaurants at the hotel (Picsces, the large bar at the top of the hotel, had a special New Year's celebration and only a limited number of guests who paid in advance were allowed in). The host told us they were full for approximately another hour (at 10:30PM) but that he would call our room as soon as there was an opening. By 11:45PM there was no phone call, so we went back downstairs only to find that they had closed for the evening. For lack of better words, we were pissed. We spent midnight out on one of the bridges that connects the hotel to the adjoining mall so we could watch the fireworks - it was nice, although we were bombarded with an entire wedding party (but hey, it was a wedding and a holiday, we weren't mad). Check-out was hectic, since it was New Year's Day. They have self check-in/out kiosks, which we used for check-out, but upon seeing extra charges on our bill we had to stand in line to speak to the front desk. Additional charges to the bill totaled over $100.00, to include parking, which was overpriced at $27.00/day, but we knew about that ahead of time; four TV music orders which we did not place; a 12 oz can of cranapple we took from the mini-bar which was $3.50 (an employee of the hotel told us all soda vending machines were removed after the mini-bars were put in each room)....needless to say, my boyfriend disputed the TV music charges. The woman at the front desk just clicked away on her computer without saying a word, handed us a new receipt minus the charges and yelled \"Next!\" Overall, our experience here was not the top-notch one we had expected. The staff was not very friendly or experienced, or even knowledgable at that. The room was nice, but for what we paid we expected something much larger. The location was great - we spent most of the day Sunday at Hooters watching the Ravens game (tip: if you're a woman and have never been to Hooters, give it a try - the food is awesome and the waitresses are absolutely adorable!) and were able to grab a cab for $5 to Flemings.

Choose from a selection of specialty martinis and enjoy a seafood sampling from our fresh raw bar. Light fare menu is also available. Well, it was closed for a privet event.

After doing this, I called back and said I thought I would just book the room itself as I wasn't sure we would have enough time for the aquarium. Luckily, I was advised to keep the package as the room rate without anything was $499. The room certainly wouldn not have been worth that! It was a nice room but nothing out of the ordinary except a big window seat that was nice to watch the harbor area. I did not book Regency Club as I felt we could not take advantage of the lounge as we would be out most of the time. We checked in before noon and had advised the hotel we would be doing so. The first receptionist was not the least bit helpful and told me to check back in a couple of hours to see if our room was ready. A few minutes later, I went to ask anothe receptionist a question and she immediately gave us a room with everything we had requested. We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was okay. We were the only two in the dining room and the service was still slow. There was not a big selection. Downstairs there was supposed to be a coffee cart with donuts and pastries but it never opened. The shops around the area were just typical tourist shops withe some of the routine chain shops at a small mall (Talbots, Banana Republic, Bebe). There is a nice selection of restaurants in the area. We had dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse which was okay. They do have a car that will pick you up and take you back. This branch, on Water Street, was very nice inside. We expected more from the food. My steak had grizzle and fat - my husbands was thin and shriveled. Truthfully, I have had just as good steaks at less expensive chain restaurants. There was also no nice presentation of anything on the platters- just a steak on a dish - that's it!!!

At the time of our booking on 11/9 Hyatt was listing the room at $309 per night. By using Priceline we saved nearly $200. Having never seen this hotel listed under $275 per night, we were pleasantly surprised. We would strongly suggest using alternative internet sites and save. We enjoyed the Hyatt but it would have been highway robbery to pay that kind of exorbitant money to stay at the Inner Harbor. While it's nice to be next to the water it's not like you can swim or sunbathe there. It's a fun area but the hotels are price gouging if they think $300 is a fair price. As you can see by our review you can stay here for much less. Unless attending a coference, you'll probably spend most of your time outside the hotel as the Light and Pratt Street Pavillions, Maryland Science Center, Federal Hill, and National Aquarium are directly across the street and well within walking distance. Ther'es more than enough to keep you occupied. One of the downsides is that you have a large number of homeless people who congregate outside of all the properties and at the harbor area venues. While they seemed harmless enough you do need to keep your wits about you. As far as the hotel is concerned, Hyatt has recently upgraded the atrium and hallways giving it a bright and modern appearance. The guestrooms, which have also been remodeled, come complete with flatscreen plasma TV's in the bedroom and scald-proof showers in the bathroom. This can be a bummer if you like taking a really hot bath or shower as the water temperature doesn't get very hot. However, it's a nice safety feature. Our overall opinion of the room was that it was clean, spacious, and gives you a great view of the city if you request a harbor view. The staff, including the concierge, front desk, and bellmen were all very friendly and accessible. They took the time to answer questions and seemed interested in us having a good stay.

Other than those two things the rooms were great. The elavators in the hotel seemed to be hit or miss. Sometimes we got right on, other times you had a good wait ahead of you. The best thing about this hotel is the location. Walk across the street and you on the Harbor. A few steps up the harbor and you are at the water taxi stop to Fell's Point which I think is ten times better than the Inner Harbor.

I had a King/Non-smoking room on the 12th floor (Regency Club Level, although the Regency Club Bar is under construction and not open). Unfortunatly I didn't have a harbor view, but the view of the downtown skyline was also nice. Customer Service was very good. I was not issued a parking pass when I arrived and had to go get one at the desk a day later, and the front desk was very appologetic for the oversight. Room was great...very large, modern furniture and fixtures. I had a great King sized bed with tons of pillows, two small lounge chairs, a desk and a rolling desk chair. 37\" Flat Screen HD TV was also nice and swiveled 360 degrees so I could see it great from the bed and from the desk. The bathroom was nicely appointed with chrome and glass fixtures and glass shower with granite countertops and good tile (no tub - this might concern some travelers with children or seniors). AC in the hallways and common areas of the hotel was very cool...nice to walk in from the summer heat and humidity and into cool, beautiful lobby. Overall service was excellent, but with three dozen bars and restaraunts in walking distance, I never ate at the hotel. From glancing at the menu, prices at the casual dining restaraunt (bistro 300) are overpriced and the upscale, top floor restaraunt (Picese) was VERY overprices...but this is nothing unusual for a downtown, upscale hotel. Hey, the parking garadge has a sky-bridge walkway to Hooters on the Waterfront, why the heck are you eating at the hotel! Drinks at the Bistro 300 were high as well...16 bucks for a Sapphire and Tonic and glass of house red. Again, a dozen bars across the street at the harbor waterfront...go there and drink for half the price. There was some construction going on in the parking garadge. Loud outside but not in the hotel itself. Did have some noise in the hallway penetrating my room from time to time, but the hotel cant be accountable for every 2:00 AM door slam. Minor Issues: 1. 9.99/day wireless internet. 2. 18/day self parking...these things combined add almost 30 dollars to your daily bill. 3. Slow elevators.

The Pisces brunch ($40 a head) was waaaaay overpriced. - Air-conditioning in the entire hotel was barely working - very hot in the hallways especially And, as another reviewer noted, when we checked out no one asked if we enjoyed our stay or if everything went well.

We were told by the hotel reservationist that our harbor view room on the 7th floor was newly renovated, and the weekend construction should be minimal. In a nut shell, with the exception of the Hyatt's being withing walking distance of the ball park and the lovely harbor view, our renovated room was a non-descript average sized rectangular box with paper thin walls and a front door that permitted every door slam, cough, and hall conversation to disturb us thoughout the night. At 12:15 AM, we were awakened by someone knocking at the room next door. It was Housekeeping trying unsuccessfully to deliver the roll away bed that we had requested at the front desk when we checked in at 3:00 PM! The new double beds were too small although comfortable and would have been a significant improvement to the room had they been queen sized. The flat screened TV was a nice touch, but the bathroom was disappointing with its small sink, unfashionable chrome fixtures, poor lighting, and a disgustingly filthy old bath tub that had hair in three places. The guest services checkout function on the TV didn't work, the two working elevators were small, had no air conditioning, and the only way we could catch one going down after a 10 minute wait was to get in one going up.

So we don't use valet when in Baltimore. The next-door parking is close by and with the hotel pass you can come and go as you please. TIP - for those new to Baltimore, the food in Harborplace across the street is not too good and not too cheap (and we've tried them all!) but Little Italy is a few minutes by car (ask at the desk) and there are plenty of Great Places there. Also, the Hyatt on-site restaurant is good but not great and very pricey,but with a great view. If you aren't counting your pennies you'll like it \"okay\".

Room: Was told there was no way to ensure a \"room with a view\" unless I sprung for a \"suite\" on the \"Club Level\", which I did. Getting to the \"suite\" took approximately five minutes as the elevators (while beautifully windowed on one side) are miserably slow. Our \"suite\" is in quotes as it was an unusually small room (~300 square feet). The bed was advertised as a king but was a full, which was fine, but fix the advertising, Hyatt. The \"room with a view\" was a view of the Bank of America building. Impressive, yes, of the harbor, no. Amenities: The \"Club\" room to which guests have access was eerily small and empty. It offers a continental breakfast and hors d'oeuvers but we avoided it. The bar downstairs looked quite nice, but we didn't end up stopping by. The pool is a puddle, quite literally. This was perhaps the greatest disappointment. It is a small square, ranges from 3-5 feet deep, and was packed to the sides with children.

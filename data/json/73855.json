The king-sized bed looked comfy and inviting, the granite countertop in the bathroom looked classy, and the view of downtown Phoenix was a great sight. But once you lay on the comfy bed and stare at the popcorn ceilings or go into the bathroom and see the 80s-style wood laminate cabinets holding up the granite, the room loses its shine. It was a 95-degree day. Forget about fidgeting with the air conditioner, which apparently stays at \"70\" (it felt warmer to me). The best \"air conditioner\" is to close the heavy drapes! Other than the room itself, the location is great. It is within walking distance to Chase field, US Airways Arena and bars, bars, bars!

The rooms were nice sized, very clean and confortable. All staff I encountered were friendly. The restaurant at the top, Compass, was really nice. The food was a little pricey maybe, but tasted good. The staff in the restaurant were friendly and went out of their way to make it a nice experience for myself and my daughter (6 yo). The fact that the restaurant revolves made it that much more interesting. The hotel is convenient to anything downtown of course, but also only a few miles from the airport. The Metro light rail is also close (didn't use it) and could be useful to get some areas, including travel to/from airport. Parking is plentiful, but as with most downtown's in any city you have to pay for parking. Hotel has garage next door with $12 overnight price or $19/day in/out priveleges. Overall this was a nice hotel at a nice price, I can't imagine paying more than $150/night for this hotel... but anything under is worth it.

Upon arrival it was complete chaos. The lobby was mobbed and the check-in incredibly slow. Anticipating a long check-in I had called an hour before arrival but the phone call was not noted. I only saw 2 people at the desk checking people in. For a hotel this size (693 rooms) and the amount of people for the convention it was extremely understaffed. Although the staff was nice & friendly, the efficiency was nonexistent. Our room was made once during the four day stay. The maid service was so slow that you were lucky if it was cleaned by 4:00pm. The room was stuffy and the thermostat kept turning off and although we had ordered a hypo-allergenic room, I think the only difference is just a loud portable Heppa-filter. The bathroom was very small with only one towel hook next to the shower. The water pressure in the shower and sink was very low. During one of the days they turned the water off completely without warning for 6 hours. The elevators are very slow so add in 10-15 minute wait if you have to get anywhere on time. The only thing I liked about the hotel was the gym which was decently equipped and clean. The location is prime right across from the convention center and a few minute walk to the mall. However the parking is $12, in-&-out parking is $19, Valet is $24 a day. Free meter parking after 5:00 on Friday & weekends. Don't bother with this hotel.

The hotel had an Einstein Brothers for coffee/breakfast that was well staffed and even with convention crowds; you were able to get your coffee fairly quickly. The concierge was very helpful but we experiences that special instructions did not always seem to get to the tour guides, prices were not always accurate, and one of the restaurants recommended was closed for repairs. The hotel catered to conventions and those visiting for the sports or theater venues, so there was not much beyond that to do in the area. Taxis were readily available to get you take you someplace else though (Scottsdale was a popular destination).

They offered cute little desserts as well, such as a pumpkin creme brulee that was amazing! The meeting rooms themselves were fine...nothing spectacular though. They sort of crammed too many of us into a room the first day, but once we split into our break-out groups, it was much better. They provided the basic snacks and drinks, but I really appreciated that they had soda available first thing in the morning.

We go to the room and open the drapes to see our view...More hotel highrises and an oblique view of some mountains. Went back to the front desk and got moved to the opposite side of the hotel on the same floor. Better. But the room itself wasn't anything to write home about. Small bathroom, with no room to turn around, torn shower curtin. The main room had 2 queen beds, a small dresser, a night stand between the beds, a desk, desk chair, and some lamps. Notice anything missing? There is no chair except the desk chair, (which is fine for the desk, but not as the only place to sit for four days. What hotel doesn't supply a chair for their guest?

The restaurant opens @ 5.30 pm. We were seated rather promptly by a table at the window with a view of the downtown's numerous skyscrapers occupied mostly by bank institutions. If you came to Phoenix downtown in hopes of browsing small shops like other ordinary city, you won't find ANY in Phoenix but you will find plenty in Scottsdale 15 minute away ( by car). To turn around once, takes approximately an hour; during which we were served our meals. Please DO NOT mistake all the awards proudly displayed on the walls for ZAGATS -they are not - and very likely for a good reason. The bread you get is nothing fancy, a regular corn bread. My order of eggplant bisque tasted nothing like eggplant but rather like a heated generous scoop of lightly seasoned heavy cream. My party ordered a mushroom flat bread with goat cheese which tasted quite interesting ( in a good way, we like to explore). For the main course I ordered a grilled salmon with asparagus. All tasted fine but only thanks to all the butter my food flooded in and was clearly added to make up for LACK OF FLAVOR. My party ordered the special- a medium steak with scallops. The steak arrived medium rare with seared scallops the size of a track tire - again no seasoning besides butter whatsoever. We found out the price ($ 50.00) only when the bill arrived. The most odd food of the evening was my side order of RISOTTO???? - a breaded and deep fried cake Of some odd mix of rice and Mac cheese? - which was promptly sent back.... The salmon was $32.00, the bisque and flat bread about additional $25.00, glass of wine and one bottle of still water. Interestingly we were charged 2 x $5 because we were party of 2 regardless that my companion never even touched the glass. Despite visiting from NC I do understand that water in Arizona is scarce and perhaps pricey, still imagine a large table of some 12 folks sharing few bottles of wine and everyone paying for water even if only the driver was drinking it????? The staff was courteous but for the price -about $160 including gratuity I would expect a little more.

They all seemed very happy in their work. The downside is that the design of the building is sterile and unappealing (to me, anyway). This was an usually cold week in Phoenix (below freezing at night and low 50's day). The hotel common areas never seemed to warm up. In the room, I had the thermostat set for 74, while at home it's usually set for 68 at night. The room was spacious and well appointed. I could do morning exercises with no problem. There were plenty of convenient outlets for charging devices without having to unplug lamps or move furniture. There was a nice fitness center with variety of weight machines, free weights, bands and cardio. It was a couple of machines short of being complete, but better than most. The hotel also offers in room support fro exercise with channels devoted to it on the TV. The location is very convenient to performing arts and sports venues as well at to the large convention center. The train from the airport stops one long block away, and there is a self park garage across the street (valet service is available). There is a nice bar and an Einstein's Bagels on property. The second floor restaurant really is more of an open air eating area devoid of atmosphere. It features a decent but unremarkable breakfast buffet for $15.95 which includes coffee and juice. That's a much more reasonable price than at other Hyatts I've tried. The fees will kill you. I like higher floors, but this is the only time I've been charged extra for that that ($5/night), and I was not informed of the extra cost. The view was awful since there are several tall buildings nearby, and the practice is a good reason to choose another chain. Internet is $15.95. That's becoming more common, so frequent travelers will be better off with the USB cellular data modem from their carrier. The bed was great, the room quiet, and the shower uncommonly good. Housekeeping was very effective and seemed to learn my habits and preferences ( stayed several nights). There are some other restaurants within walking distance. I didn't see any upscale ones, but also did not walk around much due to the weather. Steve's across the street is short on atmosphere, but friendly folks, free internet and really good food (try the ostrich burger). If there are no events downtown, this is a dead area.

Overall this is a fine hotel for conventions and its location directly across the street is a plus, particularly if you are carrying items. A big plus is that they don't have a fee for accepting packages sent to them in advance for exhibiting at the shows. I had a few hiccups in checking in. First, I am not too fond of their terminals at the check-in counter; they are confusing and the people behind them end up helping you anyway. I had booked an upgraded corner king suite with balcony, as I had anticipated my wife coming along and thought she would enjoy the view and sun. Plus, I like a room with lots of light. Unfortunately when I got to the room I discovered several things; first, it was a handicap room, which I hate. My feeling is that at this price in particular I should have been notified; I definitely will ask at hotels in the future. Second, this was not a corner and looked out onto a sitting area at the same level. This was a problem because there was basically a sidewalk outside my window, so anyone waling by could look into the room. This meant that I had to keep my curtains closed constantly, which made the room tomb-like. See my photo below of my view of Phoenix. In addition, the walls transmitted noise from the room next door, apparently being used as a meeting area for some convention people. The room itself was large and fairly well appointed with a large flat TV. the bed was very comfortable; the work desk was fine. A minus was that there was no minibar. By the way, there is no bar at the hotel pool either. The tap water tasted unusually bad, to the point that I didn't want to drink it or make coffee with it. They must realize that, as they had 2 bottles available in the room, but charged over 5 bucks each; forget it, I bought some at the store below. On the plus side, the entire staff was very upbeat and helpful. The facility was modern and clean. I think in general visitors will find the rooms to be fine.

But for what you pay, you get very little value beyond pretty decor. The stingers are internet and parking. INTERNET: You'll pay $12.40 per 24 hours for EACH DEVICE. I logged into the hotel's wi-fi on my laptop and my phone. That meant two internet service charges each night: Almost $50 for a 2-night stay! I think it's ridiculous these days to have to pay for internet at my hotel. Cheap hotels don't charge for it -- why should a premium hotel? And they ding you again if you want to use wireless on your phone? PARKING: You have 3 options. Valet parking at the hotel is $27 a day! Self-park in the garage next-door is $12 per exit. So if you aren't planning to go anywhere once you park, that's what you'll pay. But if you even make one excursion, you're up to $24. Alternately, they'll sell you an unlimited in/out pass for $19 a day, but it has to be for every day of your stay. Park on the street? Not really an option. Phoenix meters charge up to 8PM on weekends, are $1.50 an hour, 2 hours max and only take coins. In the end, I paid more than $100 for parking and internet for a 2-night stay, arriving late Saturday and leaving Monday. Beyond that, the rooms are small, have no mini-fridge or mini-bar, no robes, the beds are OK but nothing special -- basically none of the things you'd expect as \"premiums\" for a premium hotel. So like I said -- the decor is very pretty. And the room was very clean. And you're in downtown Phoenix. And all added up, doesn't justify what you pay.

When we changed rooms (for bigger beds, not because anything was wrong with our first room), the staff were more than accomodating, and moved us to a new room (upgrade) for no extra charge, AND sent a valet to help us move our luggage. It really made a difference. The rooms were a little smaller than we are used to, and decorated in a contemporary style. The decor reminded me of Santa Fe, with bold southwest colors. The only vanity was located in the bathroom, so if it was occupied, the wife's makeup had to wait. The beds were terrifically comfortable, and I wish I could have slept in them longer!

Pros: - Very nice check in and concierge and operator... very nice people - Quick and easy change to get a late check-out an hour after normal time - Great downtown location - Comfortable bed and pillows - Plug on bedside lamp (this is very nice) and 2 plugs on lamp on table (If you think this obsession with plugs is weird, try staying in a room where it's hard to find a single one and then you'll realize how many things you need to plug in (esp if you're working there for several hours) - Ginger-scented Hyatt bathroom amenities smell nice (I'm reaching for compliments here) Cons: - 50 mins room service, at 4:00 pm (!!), for one caesar salad and one bottle of water - Room service salad was incredibly average - TV has an HDMI input but the \"input\" button on the TV doesn't actually work, so the input is moot - TV remote is so worn, only the number \"5\" can be seen - TV doesn't swivel all the way to be seen on the bed, and there is only one small armchair otherwise - Bathroom is tiny.

One? - Not enough hangers in the closet - No drawers, only open shelves - No refrigerator or mini bar (I usually empty it, get my own sodas as I don't drink coffee, and get milk for morning cereal to try to counter the \"fat traveler effect\"... no luck on this trip) - No in-room safe - Desk is too small to comfortably fit a laptop and a room service tray - Tub shower (vs. a nice tiled \"walkin\" shower)... - A lot of activity on my floor - people in and out all night. It was if they put everyone on one floor to make all their work easier. Not great for noise although not too disturbing (just odd). More: - I didn't try internet as I have an aircard - Colleagues said fitness room is nice but I walked instead, so can't verify I recently stayed at the new Phoenix Westin and it was DIVINE!! Standard room came with a couch, chairs, huge desk, empty refrigerator, lots of coffee, huge foyer, huge bathroom, walk-in shower you could switch between \"rain\" and \"regular\", great TV with HDMI input, etc. Tons of public sitting areas to have a business chat as well.

No. The biggets niggle for me was no free wi-fi, and a charge of $12.50 for it per device that you logged onto. Utter joke. So for 2 iPads and a phone it was nearly $40 of wi-fi charges for 24 hours, when queried reception said thats what it is, you have used it so you need to pay. In my opinion if a small chain-free hotel can manage to offer it for free then so should a huge chain like Hyatt. And ive stayed in other Hyatts where it it is free. Id never stay here again on this alone. Add to that a chareg for late checkout of half a days room rate at $90 for asking for a 2 hour extention to latest check out time again seems a tad harsh. The hotel wasnt that busy so it isnt like they needed the room there and then. A small fee id accept but half a days rate is again a bit of a joke.

He called the front desk, had us switched, moved us to the correct room, went down and retrieved the new keys for us. Very nice, especially since I am somewhat handicapped.

We arrive and immediately notice our room had just a sliver of toilet paper (no extra roll) and 2 decaf coffee pods. We rang housekeeping and asked for more toilet paper and regular coffee (person did not speak english). Waited for a little while but no one showed up. Left room and when returned noticed 2 rolls of toilet paper but no coffee, gave us more hand towels instead. I travel with extra coffee pods thank goodness.

This option obviously makes them the least amount of money as they make it very inconvenient to purchase this. Short term $12 - 1 time trip.

I was \"directed\" to the kiosk to check in, and while I was asking questions about the parking and hotel, the employee was pushing buttons on the kiosk.

Since it was my first visit to Phoenix, and I invariably stay at a Hyatt property on business, I was looking forward to my stay here. The hotel's main prize is its proximity to just about anything you could want downtown. The Convention center was directly across the street, and with major venues like Chase Field, US Airways, and a slew of fine and casual dining restaurants within a few blocks walk, it was ideally situated for your needs downtown. It was obvious that the hotel went to great lengths to showcase the esthetic appeal, for the lobby was grand, spacious, and tastefully decorated with high-end items, waterfalls, and elevators opened to the surrounding street and mountains in the distance. That being said, this was the most expensive Hyatt I have stayed at to date, by miles, and even with a group \"discount\" for convention-goers. The rooms were massive, especially the bathrooms, and, again, tastefully done. But it felt like there were hardly enough furnishings to make a dent in the amount of wasted space. The beds were very comfortable and the sleep quality great, but would be expected even given a less expensive room. The absence of an in-room safe for valuable personal effects was a curious omission, and quite notable given the high room rate. Internet access was wireless, in-room, and for a fee, but there was a business upgrade that allowed you internet access, one free breakfast item (buffet or off the menu item) and one shirt/dress press for $25 per day extra, which more than paid for itself if you utilized these services individually. A Wall Street Journal was delivered to the room daily. Menu selections in the couple of dining areas on site had good variety, and the hotel featured a festive bar and grill on premises with high quality food, and good selection, although last call for drinks and food was 11PM, making it somewhat inconvenient for patrons coming back from an event and wanting to unwind, and spend money at the hotel. Again, being a Hyatt Gold Passport member for years, and always preferring a Hyatt property where available, I would have to rate this aesthetically pleasing for sure, but lacking in a few critical areas that you'd expect a luxury chain hotel to excel in.

I did use the exercise room during my stay, it was clean and equippped with all the equipment I would want. The pool was small but I enjoyed the few times I was able to spend there. I did not eat in the restaurants in the hotel but every morning went for a coffee at the small bagel shop in the lobby.

I could hear all my neighbor's activities, from screaming babies to various adult activities. If I stay at another Hyatt, I'm bringing ear plugs. 2) The rooms need to be re-designed in order to accommodate longer-term guests who are staying for more than two days. For example, mini-frigs and microwaves need to be placed in rooms, clothing hooks need to be installed in bathrooms and more drawer space needs to be provided. If not, more hangers need to be placed in the room so guests don't have to call down for more. The design of the rooms need to be tweaked so it is more practical for guests. The giant cactus picture, funky water spicket (sp?) and roll door is aesthetically pleasing, but not practical. The bathroom needs to be larger in general. If not, than some type of wooden fixture needs to be placed under the sink so guests can store there toilietries. Safety grips also need to be installed in the shower tub or at least safety strips affixed to the bottom of the tub. The mat is uneffective and in some cases, was dangerous.

Better to stay in Tempe or Scottsdale where there is some nightlife.

It\u2019s a very nice property that has been kept up well over the 30+ years of its existence. Having grown up in Phoenix, I watched this hotel being built. It was quite the sensation with its eight-story open-air lobby and revolving restaurant on top. Three decades hence, it\u2019s still a very nice hotel. Obviously, the hotel has been refurbished (probably several times) since its construction so room amenities are strictly 21st century: comfortable beds with multiple pillows and high thread-count linens, flat screen TV, work stations with Internet access (both wired and wireless), iron and ironing board, iHome radio/iPod dock, higher-end amenities in the bathrooms, and bathrobes available upon request. Owing to its late-70s vintage, however, the standard rooms are a bit on the small side. The air conditioning, while a step up from the wall-mounted units popular in so many hotels, is still noisier than it ought to be. And the soundproofing leaves something to be desired; several times, I heard fellow guests in adjoining rooms or out in the hall. Further, I will never understand why upscale hotels like the Hyatt Regency use thin, cheap-feeling towels and then \u2013 worse \u2013 let them get so worn that they develop spots so thin you can see through them. The first morning, my bath towel had a couple of large thin spots as well as a noticeable stain. The bath mat I used on two out of three mornings had begun to fall apart and had numerous loose threads hanging from them. Generally, though, the property continues to impress. The revolving restaurant on the 24th floor, the Compass, offers great views of Phoenix and some pretty good food and drink as well. If you\u2019re acrophobic, the Terrace Caf\u00e9 on the second floor atrium level or the Networks Bar and Grill on the ground floor are more casual but still pretty good, though without the views. There are several shops, including an Einstein\u2019s Bagels, off the lobby and a car rental counter on site. The hotel also offers a pool, fitness center, and business center. Downtown Phoenix, though, is a downtown that has never quite found its feet. Certainly, the Convention Center, U.S. Airways Center, and Chase Field draw crowds for specific events, but when there\u2019s nothing special happening, the area gets pretty barren, save for the area\u2019s homeless. But if you\u2019re going to Phoenix for a meeting or event downtown, definitely consider the Hyatt Regency. If you want to take in a view of the city, The Compass provides that for the cost of a drink, even if you\u2019re staying somewhere else.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BurghGirl71", "Title": "\u201cNo Frills, Overpriced\u201d", "Author": "BurghGirl71", "ReviewID": "UR58456653", "Content": "I accompanied my husband to a show at the convention center. His company gave us a choice of hotels so we stayed at the Hyatt for my convenience in reaching day time venues while he was working - the others were too far away from the light rail. They did allow us to check in early the day of our arrival which was a big bonus. The room was merely average - desert generic decor, but sort of a dated look. Linens so-so. Limited TV channel selection. Pay plan for wireless internet access- it was $12-14 a day which is an outrage when it is free at the Holiday Inn Express. Not very fast either. Housekeeping skipped our room the first day because she saw me enter the room but did not see me leave a few minutes later. She apparently paid no attention to the fact that there was no Do Not Disturb hanger. I had to call late in the day to get the room cleaned and then they didn't leave face cloths or provide an extra roll of TP. Took 3 calls to get it all right. Having said that, the staff was always responsive and polite (I was polite when I called.) Limited \"amenities\" included a very weak hair dryer. Shampoo and hand soaps were provided and a very stinky hand lotion. The \"fragrances\" were awful. No tissues were provided. (really, Hyatt?) Iron and Ironing board in closet along with one extra blanket. Laundry service was available which we used because we were extending our trip. I have no idea if prices are in line or not -first time i have ever used such a service. $7 to launder a pair of jeans. The items were returned the same day around 530 pm and my jeans never looked so good. Day 1, I heard very loud construction-type noises all morning in rooms above and beside us. When I left to go to a museum I discovered a young man on the floor by the elevators cutting the carpeting. When I returned some hours later (apparently he was at it all day,) he was gluing the seams. The rest of the day and all night into the next day, our floor reeked of that overwhelmingly horrible chemical smell of glue. No warnings were given to the guests on that score so that is bad. They obviously didn't care who was breathing those fumes. Are we hotel customers supposed to be huffers? Noise continued day 2. The concierge employees were most helpful and friendly. Gave us good directions to the light rail, the closest drugstore and restaurants and when they found out upon our check out where we headed next, gave us some small publications and a map. Nice touch. FOOD: The restaurants were OK-not great. Didn't get to try Compass as it was closed for a private party. Their breakfast is held in a separate small space on the 2nd or 3rd floor that quickly crowds. Buffet offered was $14.95 and limited selections. No vegan entrees on the buffet which was shocking at such a hotel. Come on. Vegetarian fare consisted of eggs-scrambled only. Oatmeal was on the buffet and the only fruit offered was cantaloupe and honey dew. Again. Come on. The only thing good was the coffee. Food was not kept hot enough on the buffet which is a food safety issue. It doesn't take a long time to produce a bad outcome with eggs. There is an Einsteins' Bagel for breakfast and lunch which is better priced. A 2 to 5 minute walk about the neighborhood shows you that there are much better and cheaper places to eat. Lots of places are open for breakfast. For dinner walk a couple blocks north to the Sheraton and eat at District, or walk south and eat at Kincaid's. For entrees, I preferred District and my husband Kincaid's. The portions at Kincaid's prevented dessert. At District get the whoopie pies and \"milkshake.\" We both LOVED those. There are bunches of restaurants all over the area. AREA: a couple blocks from the Hyatt and Convention Center was the Arizona Center which is small outdoor shopping \"mall\" with mostly restaurants and cheesy gift shops. Some store fronts are closed. It is a tourist or convention-goers trap. There is no drug store nearby - you have to take the light rail. I followed concierge directions with no trouble. It is basically an honor system. You pay $1.75 a ride no matter where you are going. $3.50 gets you all day. No one checks to see that you have a ticket which I find very odd. There are no turnstiles or ticket readers per DC Metro. You 'activate\" the ticket but no one checks it. The CVS is the closest to the Hyatt-they said about a mile but it sure seemed further than that. It was right by the rail line but the sidewalks and everything around were run down, littered and dirty with graffiti on the sidewalk and nefarious characters hanging about. I have no idea whether it is safe or not but it sure didn't seem to be. Perhaps the hotel personnel should find out? SUMMARY: My impression is that the Hyatt Regency management feels they have a captive and well-heeled business clientele from the Convention Center who are on expense accounts and therefore, don't care that the Hyatt is pretentious and overpriced and offer few amenities. Overall, a real bare bones, a la carte hotel. You get only the value of the location and everything else is overpriced for its quality - or lack of same. The management and housekeeping should try to emulate the concierge staff.

It is exceptionally convenient to access the baseball & basketball arena's, some great restaurants and a lot of cool bars.

Networks is a great bar and they have significant patio seating. Again, this is a pricey place but if you want to be smack dab in the middle of downtown Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency is a great choice.

Luckily, I modified my reservation after I found the AAA Business Plan for $174/night and it came with 2 free breakfast ($14.99/pp) and free internet ($12.99/day).

The gift shop had a very varied selection, and staff people were friendly there as well.

The hotel was nowhere near capacity, so I have no idea why they would put anyone in these rooms. After checking in, we stopped at Networks for a quick bite and some drinks. The mojitos that they advertise as a special were awful, and I love mojitos. That could be because the service people all seemed to be drunk. One waitress tripped on a step and rolled around on the floor laughing. Our waiter kept bumping into our table, chair, and drinks. The pizza tasted like one of the microwave versions, and the four coconut shrimp for $10 were not worth the money. It was $50 down the toilet, and it convinced us not to have dinner at the Compass Room upstairs. The next day, the front desk gave us a room on the 17th floor, at my request. The view was spectacular, but the room was very small, and missing the decorative touches (throw pillows, blanket, arm chair) of the first room. The only mirror was over the sink in the bathroom, which makes it very difficult for someone to get ready while their spouse is in the shower. There was no full length mirror. That night, I was not feeling well, so against our better judgement, be ventured up to the Compass Room for a snack. My husband had the bisque, which was smokey and good. We had a couple of drinks and the trio custard, and they were fine. The decor left a lot to be desired, but I guess the view was meant to carry the restaurant. Unfortunately, we went back down to Networks for March Madness. I had a martini since it was 'Tini Tuesday and they were $2 off. When the bill came, the drink was not discounted. The bartender said the special was only for 4-6 and 11-2. The sign was right in front of us, and it said nothing of the sort.

This hotel is downtown near the convention center, which is the standard type of hotel I expect to get from priceline in a major city for a weekend. Parking: There's self-parking in the garage next door, valet or street parking. Street parking seems really hard to find, so we opted for the garage. It's $10 with no in/out (paid at the garage) or $16/day with in and out (paid at the hotel). There's also valet for $23/day. Typical prices. One caveat: the USAirways Center is close by. If there is an event going on, parking might be harder than usual and there might be crowds to contend with. We got there as a Suns game was letting out, so traffic was a bit heavier than expected, but no unbearable. Check-in: We checked in around 10 PM on a Friday night. They said they had no non-smoking king rooms available, so the options were a two double beds, two queen beds, or one queen. We opted for the queen. Also, my reservation was booked as two separate reservations (I initially bid for one night on priceline and then decided to extend by one day). The representative noted it and I thought he linked the two reservations, but apparently he did not. On the Saturday when we returned to the room at 4 PM, housekeeping had still not visited because they thought we were checking out. The Room: We actually ended up in two different rooms. The first room at a single queen on the 21st (top) floor. Two big issues with this room. First, the queen bed isn't really a queen bed. It's more like the size of a double and not at all comfortable for two people. Second, the room has two doors that connected to the rooms on either size. The noise traveled through the doors like they weren't even there. You can CLEARLY hear your neighbors conversations as if they were right in your room even if they are talking in normal inside voices. If you get one of these rooms, I recommend switching right away. The second day we stopped at the desk to ask a question about parking and were offered a king room that had become available. Of course, we switched and the room was so much better. No interior doors for noise to travel through and a real bed. Exercise room: Small, but up to date. There's about 10 cardio machines (treadmills, cross trainers and bikes). Each has a built-in TV. They have headphones for use, but I recommend bringing your own as they didn't always have clean ones available. It also has a small weight area. It's a very small room that got crowded really quickly. Maybe because it was right after New Year's and everyone is trying to stick with their resolutions, but I've never seen a hotel exercise room that crowded. I thought it was open 24 hours, but the sign posted said 6 AM to 10 PM. Not sure which one was right. One nice touch: They had a wine cooler with cold,damp towels in it. Great for post workout. Food: We did the breakfast buffet on Sunday for $17.95/person. Well stocked with lots of options. Overall: Standard convention center hotel.

The hotel itself is large enough to take a romantic stroll late at night while admiring the artwork strung through the lobby and downstairs area.

Tonight, a group of 13 of us got together for dinner at a local restaurant. We asked the bellman for cabs. Limousines arrived. Some in our party specifically asked why we had limousines instead of cabs. The bellman told us these were cabs. A couple of us who had been out around the town already remarked that we had not seen cabs in the city, and we thought maybe this was another of the weird surreal things about this very weird surreal city. In hindsight, we should have been more wary. We were being screwed. Of course these weren't cabs. There was no meter, just an announcement of a charge at the end of the trip. The limos cost a total of $95 plus tips to take us about 5 miles. At the end of our meal, we asked for cabs, and got...cabs! Total fare: $39 plus tips. We confronted the bellman, who first said we had asked for limos. We were clear that we had not. Then he said he was using \"our regular car service,\" but said that we had been overcharged. We protested that the problem wasn't just that we had been overcharged, but that in fact we had gotten what we did not ask for and that we were not dealt with honestly. He told us we were free to talk to the manager. We did so. The manager apologized, but when I asked him directly what the hotel's policy was on calling limos when guests asked for cabs, he denied that this was their practice. However, in discussing the issue with other conference attendees, it seems that consistently guests who ask for cabs are being ushered into limos, and then stuck with bills at the end of the trip. I have seen the limo/cab scam elsewhere. it's not unique to this hotel. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a kickback involved. But guests have a right to be treated fairly, not be hustled into scams, and to be able to trust our hosts. The Phoenix Hyatt failed on all counts. I won't be coming back. If you must stay here and need a cab rather than a limo, be sure to be explicit with the bellman, and don't get into a car without a meter unless you negotiate on price up front. Know also that cab fares are relatively low, so you should probably expect to pay less than you might think.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evergreen, CO", "Title": "\u201cNot one of the best Hyatts\u201d", "Author": "MHS8874", "ReviewID": "UR15713797", "Content": "The hotel is aging, but somewhat gracefully.

I explained I had asthma, but all the guard did was apologize, and said he'd go up again. He never followed up though. Fortunately, the smoke diminished in the next ten minutes and with the fan on high, I could sleep. I did speak with the manager the next day, and he said he'd contact me after he followed up. My company paid $180 per night for this. Maybe if I had gotten a Priceline bargain of $35 I'd be happier. Also, they charge $12 per day for wireless access, but don't mention that anywhere until you log on.", "Date": "January 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cJust Okay/A Place to Sleep\u201d", "Author": "annenorman", "ReviewID": "UR4325386", "Content": "We stayed at this Hyatt facility for two nights, namely December 10 and 11, 2005. Overall, we rated this hotel as a decent place to sleep; most guests would not find the facility attractive enough to do anything there except sleep at night and leave. The property is bland. There is nothing visually appealing about this hotel. It has floors, ceilings, walls, lights and a few pieces of bad art. The rooms are ordinary, basic, even simple. The bathrooms are very small. The hallways are dull and lifeless. With one exception, the staff was not stimulating or even modestly attentive. We recall the neutral greeting when we approached the desk Saturday morning to check in. This young woman either was having a bad day or absolutely hated her job. The doormen were okay, mildly pleasant. We did not encounter any of the housekeepers. The most attentive person we encountered after two nights was the man at the desk when we checked out early Monday morning. He was focused, charming and engaging -- a major, and positive, departure from the other persons we met while at this hotel. We relied on the concierge to select a restaurant outside the hotel for dinner one night. He recommmended an Italian restaurant (we have forgotten the name, for reasons detailed below) located about ten minutes away by car. The food was very poor. The service was good. The facility had not been renovated since the 1970's. The recommendation was so poor that it made us wonder about the motivations of this hotel representative to recommend this place -- did he really dislike us that much, or did he have a personal interest in our visit? We had breakfast at the hotel one morning. The food was poor, in taste, quality and presentation. The service was okay. The buffet -- an option we did not select -- looked like the food items had been recycled recently. It was expensive, though. A bar is located in the lobby. It yields lots of cigarette smoke that invades and lingers in other sections of the lobby area. The facility is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Overall, this hotel is okay. It is not charming or elegant. It is not staffed by a motivated or engaged team of workers. We rate it merely as a place to bunk for a night or two. In summary, this facility is not at this time well positioned to compete for your discretinary personal or business travel dollars. In our view, this hotel experienced better days years ago. We do not plan to return.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFunny angled TV\u201d", "Author": "Treborwf", "ReviewID": "UR4111276", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9e and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency hotel Sept 30-Oct 2. We were able to check-in early, and arrived to a nice clean room. However, the television was in a cabinet at a 90 degree angle to the bed. You could pull the TV out on a sliding shelf & turn it towards the bed, however, it didn\u2019t pull out far enough so the cabinet obscured about a quarter of the TV. In order to watch the TV properly, you either had to lie on the right hand side of the bed (no good if there are 2 of you) or you would have to sit in the corner chair. Also, the coffee maker was in the bathroom, which I found rather unsanitary and inconvenient. Perhaps worst of all, the room had no internet access. I wanted to check in for my Sunday flight on Saturday evening and inquired at reception about internet access within the hotel. The clerk told me that they had internet access in the UPS Store, but it was closed, and closed on Sunday. I can't believe a hotel the caliber of Hyatt doesn't offer in-room internet access, or at least a business center. I had to ask her where the nearest internet caf\u00e9 was, as she did not offer the information. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Hyatt experience was the Sports Grill/Bar downstairs. We went to get lunch the day we checked in, and it wasn't busy. A server said she would be with us in a minute. She never came back, so after 20 minutes, we left and went across the street. The next evening we went back down to the bar to have a drink. It was very busy and only one server for almost the entire bar. People were getting up and leaving after not being even acknowledged, let alone have their drink orders taken. Finally, when he came up to our table, I asked him what beers he had on draft. Instead of simply answering me, he grabbed the menu, opened it to the page listing beers, saying nothing. Not only did I find that very rude, he was almost 30 minutes getting our order to us. Meanwhile, more people are leaving than are coming into the place. We would've left and gone across the street, but there was a power outage affecting all the restaurants near the hotel. During our stay, we ate at a two restaurants across the street and were greeted promptly and courteously. Both the food and the service were very good and well beyond the Hyatt. For a major hotel in the heart of downtown Phoenix, serving not only guests but locals, the Hyatt Regency leaves much to be desired.", "Date": "November 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herndon, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood room, thin walls\u201d", "Author": "antshe", "ReviewID": "UR3985697", "Content": "The room is large and clean, the staff is attentive and responsive, the walls are thin.

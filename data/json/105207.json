I called the front desk and was told that they would check to see if there were clean sheets and bring them to my room. The hotel staff came to the room with the blanket. I explained the blanket was fine and showed him the sheets. He went back downstairs and returned later with two flat sheets. I took them and had to change the linen myself. YUCK!! With another \"!\" During the night my family and I sweated so bad we were wet. The air was turned down as low as possible and blowing as hard as it could. However it just did not work. I spoke to the manager at checkout and he was completely unconcerned. Probably had heard the complaint before and just didn't do anything about it. His attitude was \"Oh really. So what...I got your money. Now get out. Too bad for you.\" He did nothing. So I'm doing what I can by giving him some free advertisement.

We paid the same for our room here as we did at the much nicer Doubletree downtown, so it felt like a rip-off but we soldiered on. Overall, we felt like it was an ok place to stay, albeit out of the way, but that changed when we discovered BED BUG BITES in the morning. In the week following our stay, we contacted the hotel directly to report the problem and ask for our money back. They never returned my calls, did not seem to care that we had been bitten, and finally determined that there were no bed bugs and so no problem. They refused to reimburse us for our stay and remained unapologetic.

I have had bad experiences with Days Inns in the past, but I decided to go for this one because the price was lower than others. This hotel was much better than I expected. The decor was not too stylish, but the bed was very comfortable and the shower had plenty of water pressure and hot water. The air conditioner worked great. The room was clean but the finish on the sink was flaking off which made it look dirty. Also, it was very quiet. We heard someone pass by with a rolling bag once, but that was all the noise we heard. Breakfast was not fancy, but it was about as expected from most motels. The only real complaint was that the light bulbs in the lamps seemed to be around 15 watts. It was hard to read.

Reading TripAdvisor reviews, it seemed that I'd run the risk of being knifed overnight in a room filled with cockroaches if I didn't pay over $150 per night somewhere. My mom and sister and I really didn't want to pay that much for a hotel! Nor did we want to stay in one of Memphis' apparently abundantly sketchy neighborhoods, or in a dirty hotel. This Days Inn was a great compromise. Since we had a rental car, it didn't matter how far we were from downtown. And the rates are nice and cheap! The rooms were solid. My sister went inspecting the sheets for bedbugs and stains and found nothing. My mom's room was also fine. The bathrooms were clean and adequate. The beds were comfortable. There wasn't too much noise - especially since we were on the back side of the hotel, away from the street. In the evenings, we dragged our chairs onto the balcony and enjoyed the lovely weather. It wasn't a beautiful view staring into the side of the LaQuinta next door, but the grass around the hotel is green and you can still see the sky :) Breakfast was fine - enough choices for a picky eater and even a vegan. I have three complaints that are absolutely negated by how reasonable the rates were: 1) my mom's refrigerator didn't work - she lost some tasty leftovers from a meal out that she was looking forward to finishing the next day 2) our microwave didn't work - I just used my mom's next door 3) the 'neighborhood' is a street lined with nothing but hotels, fast food chains, gas stations, and more hotels. There's really nothing to do or see in the environs - but I was aware of that going in. The Days Inn is right off route 40, and about 20 minutes to everything we wanted to do - 20 minutes from Graceland, 20 minutes from Beale Street/downtown/Sun Studios/Stax, etc. I also recommend going to Corky's in Germantown from here - it's only about 10 minutes away. All in all, this was a perfect hotel for our purposes, cheap, safe, and fully capable of delivering a good night's sleep to anyone. it's really all I could have asked for for under $100/night.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hot Springs National Park", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again\u201d", "Author": "wmmary", "ReviewID": "UR13106362", "Content": "Room was clean and the staff were courteous.

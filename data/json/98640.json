As other reviews mentioned, this place could really use a remodel. You'll roll your eyes at the Texas kitsch. The front desk staff was pleasant. Check in went quickly. They were prompt and courteous with questions we asked and they called a cab for us when we were ready to go out. So, the service was good. We stayed on the 15th floor. HIghway/train noise was very noticeable. I suppose that's hard to avoid when an entire wall is windows. Heads up: our room didn't have a little refrigerator or microwave. I found that odd. Also, their room service ends at 11:00 p.m. & we couldn't find any snack vending machines, only soda machines. So when we returned late that night from a concert we had attended, we were kind of hungry and couldn't get any snacks. All in all, it was on okay stay.

However, the location is good, and once you know your way around the immediate area, the hotel is convenient. I have stayed here several times but never bothered to write a review, as I figured it was an adequate hotel for business trips, well located and you pretty much get what you pay for here - nothing special one way or the other. Breakfast buffet is pretty good, although not cheap. Parking in the lot outside is convenient, but it's uncovered so during the summer try to stay in the hotel's shade or the Dallas sun will bake the inside of your car like a pizza oven. My other stays here were uneventful. So we get to why I wrote the review this time. Simply put, I got an unpleasant surprise in the bathroom - a dirty washcloth was left over the top of the shower curtain. I didn't notice it until I was brushing my teeth getting ready for bed. It was dried into a curved shape over the shower rod and yes, brace yourselves, it had hairs on it. Not to be too dramatic, but I was thoroughly disgusted. I picked it up with a clean washcloth and threw it in the corner of the open closet. Just plain nastiness. My point is when you see things like this it calls into question the training of the cleaning staff and the care they take. Okay you may say that's one thing and everybody makes mistakes. Yes, that is true, but worse than finding the dirty old washcloth - mostly it makes you wonder what else they missed. I also noticed the clean towels didn't smell all that clean, plus the air freshener scent was overwheming, making me wonder whether they were covering up smoke or, worse, the sickness of the last person who stayed in the room and found a dirty, crusted, hairy washcloth greeting them in the bathroom. Hey folks, it is what it is. All that being said, the little contact I had with hotel staff was pleasant and they seemed generally friendly. Also, my room was pitch black once I used binder clips on the curtains. That was great for me. Most hotels have all sorts of LED lights and light coming through the doors even with towels under them. You take the good with the bad when you spend under $200 at a business hotel during the week in a big city, and I can and will make some compromises because my clients will not pay for me to stay at the W, but the washcloth incident and air-freshener fiesta will affect my decision as to whether to stay here again.

When you first walk in, they have the lobby looking outstanding of course but then when you get to the rooms they were disgusting. Carpets were stained, i had cigarette burns in my comforter, food crumbs fell out of it too when i took it off. Wallpaper was peeling and looked dingy, none of the counter tops or desks tops were clean, they all had stains on them. No refrigerator, had to pay for wifi in your room. The hallways also had just a musty, old smell to them. I was there for a conference and when i came back to my room later one afternoon, whoever had cleaned my room had left my door opened all day so anyone could have got in my room. The food was overpriced, not very good at all and made me literally sick (for real, wont go into details). One evening i was laying in bed and i kept smelling cigarette smoke in room and it finally got so strong that i called down to the front desk to find out if smoking was allowed in the hotel and they said only on the 10th floor, well of course i was on the 11th floor and it was literally coming up through the floor and it was so strong that it made me naseous. So finally they offered us another room at about 11:30 at night. The location absolutely sucked. There is not much around and you better be packing if you go out at night. There also was a rail system that runs right by the hotel and it can be heard in the rooms. We had no rental car so we had to rely on the hotel transportation to take us places and even then they only covered a 3 mile radius. They also said they drop off and pick up every hour on the hour at a mall that was across the highway(it was only about half a mile away but too dangerous to walk to because of the highways) so we decided to do that one day and when were done we were outside before 4pm to catch the next shuttle and what a surprise no one showed up so i called the hotel and they happily said they would send some right over...another 15 minutes goes by and no one shows up so i have to end up calling again and once again they said they would send someone right over and we ended up waiting another 10-15 minutes. So finally they showed up after 4:30 so explain to me what happened to every hour on the hour? The only place to get snacks was in the hotel gift shop and since we had no car i thought i would go down and get some snacks and water since were going to be there 3 days. So i got two small bags of chips and a bottle of water and it rang up over $8! I looked at the charges and that flippin bottle of water was almost $5! so i said screw that and we took the shuttle to a grocery store where i found the exact same bottle of water for $1, seriously!

My husband and I stayed here for several days over a weekend. We were in town to see family and also were working during the trip, so we used the internet access. Overall, I wasn't impressed, and I will not stay here again. On the positive side, the front desk staff were nice, the hotel had been renovated fairly recently, Doubletree still gives out their famous chocolate chip cookies, and the location is convenient (right by Northpark and the freeway). The biggest negative was that we got stuck in a smoking room, despite having talked to them on the phone in advance and gotten their commitment to reserve a non-smoking room. When we arrived to check in, they said they \"they didn't have a record of that\" and no non-smoking rooms were available. So we were stuck; if we had walked out and gone elsewhere, we would have been stuck with the first night charge as a cancellation fee. So we sucked it up and stayed there. What I suspect happened, is that because they had a very large conference in the hotel that weekend (some kind of \"personal success\" tony robbins type thing) -- my guess is that the conference ended up wanting more rooms / more non-smoking rooms, and the hotel accommodated the conference people at the expense of those few of us at the hotel that weren't part of the conference. Which makes sense from a financial perspective, but it screwed up our stay. The non-smoking room had been cleaned of course, but it did smell quite musty -- and the worst part, when I got home, was realizing that all my clothes absolutely STANK of smoke. I'm not particular sensitive to smells -- but once out of the room, it was obvious how bad the air had been. I ended up washing, dry-cleaning, and airing out all clothes, shoes and luggage I'd taken on the trip to get rid of the smell. A minor annoyance is the internet fee. It's standard for a lot of upscale hotels (the Ritz Carltons of the world) -- but, most of the business hotels now (and all the \"discount\" hotels) offer internet as complimentary. So that additional $10-per-day ding is unnecessary and I was a little surprised that Doubletree was still charging it. We weren't bothered by the conference crowds, but then we didn't use any of the public areas (they did look pretty crowded when we walked through). Parking was a bit of a hassle. The hotel shares its parking with the two big office towers next door, which means parking during the week is crowded, and then parking at the weekend was crowded due to the conference. The main front-door lot isn't large enough, and the underground parking is a little confusing/badly signed, and creepy and isolated at night ( so if you're a female guest alone, you might be uncomfortable parking in the underground garage esp at night ).

The hotel is located in what a friend of mine described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153island d in a sea of freeways.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nestled between two office towers called the Campbell Centre I and II, the hotel is near the Northpark shopping mall. This upscale shopping mall is within walking distance of the hotel and there are several good restaurants located near the mall. However, there is no way to walk to any place close by due to the lack of sidewalks or pedestrian paths. The only way to get anywhere safely is by car, the hotel shuttle or a taxi. Be prepared to rely on your own wheels, a taxi, a shuttle or a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car for getting around or risk being hit by a car trying to walk anywhere. If you do drive yourself, there is free outdoor parking in front of the hotel entrance. You can also use the free underground parking directly under the hotel. Ask at the front desk when you check in about it and they will give you the access code for gaining entry and exit. There is an elevator you that will take directly from the underground parking garage directly to your hotel room floor. At check-in the staff at the front desk was very friendly and they give out free fresh baked cookies in the afternoons. The front desk was very good about answering questions and making suggestions for dinner and lining up transportation via the hotel shuttle. The rooms appear to be recently remodeled and were clean. The beds were comfortable and they were fitted with down comforters and down pillows. My bathroom was papered with large stars, for the Lone Star State, somewhat overwhelming. The bathroom amenities consisted of face and bath soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and a small tube of face cream, all Neutrogena products. Be aware that the water from the tap is not pleasant to drink. However, the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss a beat and provides a large bottle of water on the dresser for $4.00. You might want to consider going to the convenience store next to the hotel or the Bay Street Deli next-door for cheaper bottled water. See my notes below for locations of these places. All the rooms have floor to ceiling windows with good views. I was located on the 4th floor. During the time I stayed here a winter storm arrived with rain and cold. Upon arrival my windows were covered with condensation and there were puddles of water on the floor window ledge. A leak in the window created a constant drip. When the rain stopped the condensation went away as well as the drip. The heating and cooling system worked well, but the room had a slight musty odor that must have been due to the high humidity in the room. The windows could not be opened, so there was no way to get any outside fresh air into the room. During my stay housekeeping was prompted, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to do a good job of vacuuming the room each day. They also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave an extra roll of toilet paper, so if you arrive and it is low, ask for more. The hotel has a workout room and an outside running/walking area on the 2nd floor. The equipment was a good variety, high tech, some with individual TVs and included treadmills, bikes, weight machine, free weights and best of all a really clean exercise room! I didn't check out the pool. The hotel also has an agreement with local nearby gym that you can use for $15 a day. You can try to walk the short distance to the gym, but I would suggest that you use the hotel shuttle to get there or risk being run over by the local traffic. Room service was prompt, but the prices, were a bit high. They also charge an additional 21% for a room services tip and a $2.00 service fee in addition to the regular sales tax. A bowl of soup, $4 on the menu ran to almost $7 with the add-ons. The restaurant food, which is also the room service vendor, was good and the selection was adequate. However, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend a lot there is place called the Bay Street Deli that is located just off the hotel lobby near the restaurant in one of the Campbell Center buildings which are connected to the hotel. The Deli served a quick hot breakfast, hot lunch and sandwiches. To get there go past the hotel restaurant and gift shop, up the stairs, through the double glass doors and into the Campbell Center building. You will see it on the right as you walk down that hallway. The prices there are very reasonable; I paid $5 for a large two enchilada meal with pinto beans and coleslaw. This was not a simple quick dish, it really tasted like something you would get a good Mexican restaurant. The Deli is not associated with the hotel. There is also a bar lounge that is open to the lobby, just across from the hotel restaurant. The lounge opens into an area that is also a library of books that you can take to read. There are hundreds of hardback books available with a variety of titles. It is on the honor system to return them. The conference rooms were well lighted. The room we were in was somewhat cool, but when requested the hotel staff was able to elevate the temperature to a decent level. The noise level from another conference, across the wall divider from our conference, at times was annoying. There is light rail train that you can take to downtown Dallas and areas north of the hotel. This light rail train runs right by the hotel. Unfortunately, you have to take the hotel shuttle to the train station down the road a ways as the train does not stop at the hotel. If you do need to visit a convenience store there is one located just next to the hotel on the east side. To get there safely you will need to go through the underground parking garage and walk out the east entrance drive, across the light rail tracks and into the convenience store parking lot. Again, there are no sidewalks, so be careful. Not the greatest place to be stranded for a week, but it was pleasant and I would come back.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joplin, MO", "Title": "\u201cGood spot to stay!

I know these things happen, and I didn't get irritated until they seemed openly skeptical of the rate I said I booked, even after I gave them a reciept of the transaction. It took several terse words and phone calls and 15 minutes to straighten it out. When we finally got into the room it was fine, terrific view and adequately comfy. But could have been cleaner in the bathroom (the oft seen stray hairs in the tub problem, etc.) and the air vents were grungy. Later we noticed old room service trays in the hall that should have long since been picked up, and that's never a good sign at a hotel that's not full. The place just had a deserted feel about it in general, staff-wise, that I wasn't comfortable with. That's probabaly the main reason I'd go elsewhere, staff training and numbers seemed lacking. On the other side of the coin, the big plus is a great central location and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room - awesome. If you do stay there, I would highly recommend the DCVB website for a good room deal, even with the check-in hassle, as the rate we got was way better than I have seen online or elsewhere for this hotel.", "Date": "August 23, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Dallas - Campbell Centre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98640-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Dallas_Campbell_Centre-Dallas_Texas.html", "Price": "$105 - $199*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8250 North Central Expressway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dallas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TX</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">75206</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "98640", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c3/d0/c3d02acee8257996da0eae6263e3c7731large.jpg"}}

A large person would have to step into the tub to shut the door. The continental \"breakfast\" was hardly worth the trip to the 1st floor. They were usually out of food items and didn't have an attendant to replenish items. Other raters mentioned several varities of bugs, we sall none of any kind.

The rooms are ok for a few night stay but again could use some work. Our bathtub was alittle scary because it caved in alittle when you stepped in. Also the water pressure was very low. Had a little Tiki bar that was priced reasonable and Barbara,older lady, is nice and friendly. They also do not have anyone manning the parking lot so good luck in the evening finding a spot because everyone going to the Ocean Deck restaurant thats all the parking.

The ones saying this place is horrible are wrong. Or they just had a bad experience, which can happen at ANY hotel. You know some people are more picky than others and I hate when uptight people ruin the reputation of places with STANDARD accomodations... you can't pay $125 for an ocean front view room with a private balcony and expect the place to look like the Hilton. That's just unreasonable. I was on a budget, looking for a room with a nice view to watch the sunrise. This was in my price range and I'm happy I went with it. Here is the truth, coming from a 36 week pregnant, 26 year old girl who rented a room for her significant other's 30th birthday on Father's Day. I'm not some kid on \"spring break\". The hotel IS older, and I would recommend that the elevator be updated, but the rooms are clean. Customer service is very good. I did not see one single bug, so if this used to be a problem, it isn't now. For an extra $10, you can extend your stay from 11am to 1pm. The air conditioner worked very well. The tub did drain a bit slow, but it was clean. There was a mini fridge, coffee maker and microwave available for use and all worked fine. There was one small stain on the carpet, but you could tell the carpet was clean.. again the hotel is just a bit older. The beds did creak some when you moved around in them, but they were SUPER comfortable. I'm pregnant, so that counts for something! I like a bed that's a bit older and broken in. I don't like firm beds, but that's just my preference. The pillows were AWESOME. Super fluffy. I was surprised by that actually. The soap they provide smells pretty darn good, but I would bring my own shampoo next time. Theirs isn't bad, it's just the generic hotel stuff and I'm picky about my hair being soft. I did not use the safe. I took my laptop and left it in the room. No one messed with it. The front desk has towels available for when you're done swimming. Downstairs has a bar with a pool table. The pool goes to over 10 feet deep! Since the other reviews said that karaoke was a problem at the bottom and bird droppings on the balcony were a problem at the top, I requested a room at mid level. We had no problems with either one of these issues. The free breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, milk, oatmeal, 4 kinds of cereal, pre-packaged danishes and muffins and toast with jelly. I don't know why people would complain about that. That's pretty standard in the places I've gotten free breakfast. The boardwalk is super close. We walked to the mini carnival, restaurants, bars (didn't go in those though), beach shops, etc.. The pictures make it look like it's kind of in a dead area, but it's not at all. The roof on a FEW of the balconies is cracked, but that's just because it's older. The balcony was clean. It's clear from the condition of the hotel, that people swim a lot that stay in the rooms. It's got a used-beachy feel, but to me, that's not bad. I mean, they are right on the water. I will definitely stay here again if I come back. I'd rather save $30-$50 on the room per night compared to other places and have that money to do fun things. =D I hope this helps!", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kissimmee, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Lynnette D", "ReviewID": "UR132051360", "Content": "We spent 2 nights at Mayan and had no issues at all.

He asked be for my phone number and my cell phone is new so I had to look the number up which took all of 30 seconds.

The Mayan falls into the second category, but you could do a lot worse (for more money, too.) Rooms are not huge, but not tiny either. Carpets have been updated, beds are comfortable, TVs are new. Bugs - I saw some tiny spider-mites running around the bathroom sink in the mornings, and one fast-moving thing one evening, but nothing else. Note that if you open up the balcony door in the summer, you are likely to get more bugs. A/C worked fine (for a warm January). The cheapest rooms face to the side, where you will be treated to the sounds of the band playing the Ocean Deck next door, playing until the late closing time. You'll pay more for the ocean view rooms, and the higher the room number, the further away from the Ocean Deck you'll be. If you come down for Speedweeks regularly, then you have probably experienced some pretty bad rooms if you have shopped around for cheap prices, the Mayan will be a step up from most any of them. It's close by to the downtown beach clubs and souvenir shops and the pier (which is closed for renovations). 100 yards from the end if International Speedway Boulevard (ISB in local talk), so about 4 miles from DIS and all the chain restaurants in that area. The continental breakfast is cold cereal and pre-packaged pastries, but there are plenty of restaurants in the area to get a good meal. The bar is only open on certain nights, but with the Ocean Deck next door, that shouldn't deter you. The pool is not heated, but was clean, on a raised deck ocean-side. Desk staff were friendly and efficient. Cleaning staff left some easy-to-spot things uncleaned - stains on walls or doors that might have washed off when still fresh, and dirt on the in-room fridge.

The staff was nice, and this was a comfortable size room, but there were some issues. First the good stuff: The biggest benefit between this hotel and the motels I have stayed at in Daytona previously was the provided breakfast - dry cereal, instant oatmeal and grits, toast with jam or butter, packaged muffins and danishes, coffee, tea, milk, and juice. Last time I was at a hotel in Daytona, the breakfast was a box of doughnuts and when it was gone it was gone - this was much better. The not so good: Not all rooms have balconies, so don't expect one or chose to stay here based on that. In our room without a balcony, the windows wouldn't even open. If you need a non-smoking room for medical reasons, don't stay here. The room smelled fine when the hotel wasn't full, as it filled up - especially for biker week - I quickly found you will smell smoke if anyone nearby smokes. It doesn't seem like they set aside certain floors or sections for non-smokers. There is a pool, but my roommate who previously worked as a lifeguard was worried about it since he knows pool chemicals should be monitored hourly and there is never anyone monitoring the hotel pool. Otherwise the expected okay hotel supplies - disintegratingly thin tissues, weak free internet signal (though it worked better for my roommate's high-tech computer). The nightclub next door is loud from about 10p-2a. As a heavy sleeper, this did not bother me, but my roommate is a light sleeper and had lots of trouble sleeping. Then the maid service came around (on our specific floor) around 10a and were quite loud, so he didn't have much chance to sleep in. Your experience will depend on your specific sleeping habits, and possibly where your room is located as ours was across from the maid service \"room\" (which is on each floor) but my roommate did not sleep well during our trip. In terms of the maid service, I do not like to have my room cleaned unless I have an extended stay, so I can't speak specifically about it except that the room was clean when we got there.

All was as we remembered, front desk was friendly and efficient. I found the $5 per day parking fee a little ridiculuous. Once we got in the room our opinions greatly changed. We stayed in room 704. The condition as far as updates in the room were adequate compared to our last stay, but with a few unpleasant changes. The bathroom mirror hadn't been cleaned, so a stranger's tooth paste scum stared back at us. There was a razor form the previous tenant ( or perhaps maid?) left on the bathroom vanity as well. The outside of the mini-fridge was covered in a white substance, it almost looked like paint, but can't be certain, and I was afraid to touch it to find out. Yes, Ocean Deck was loud and so was the AC in the room, but that's not a big deal. The worst part was the sheets. They were as clean as you can expect a Daytona Beach hotel under 4 starts to be, but the smell, oh my gosh the smell. The sheets smelled like they were washed in seafood. Not the nice hint of the sea that a lot of beach side hotels have, but like I was sleeping in a plate of Shrimp Scampi. My husband and I both bathed before going to bed, so it wasn't us! It was the sheets! We made it a late night on the town, so by the time we got to bed it was late, and we were too tired to go through calling the front desk and having the sheets changed for our 1 nights stay. To say the least it was neausating, and we slept on top of the covers. The location is great, but the upkeep is greatly lacking.

We just got back and we were never more happy to get home due to this place. Firstly, there were tiny bugs all over the bathroom, especially at night. We were situated on the 3rd floor and were kept up all night by the Ocean Deck restaurant next door, extremely loud music permeating throughout the building. The place did not close until 2 A.M. The A / C unit was extremely loud as well, so unless you are blind and deaf, you may want to choose another hotel. Next, we received an errant phone call from the front desk at 11:30 at night regarding a mystery smoke alarm. For whatever reason, it supposedly went off in their office. And now the rooms condition: dirty! (surprise, surprise). The sheets had an odd red stain which was possibly pizza...or worse. The mattresses were terribly old and had no firmness left. Although their site is trumpeting newly renovated rooms, we must have been one of the lucky ones to receive a room from a bygone era... Breakfast was marginally passable with breakfast cereal, bread, coffee, and muffins. Pool appeared clean, but we did not risk it. So if you do not want to sleep and enjoy the company of bugs on the beachside, help yourself. But I cannot give this place my hearty recommendation.

The bathroom light, phone, TV, Wi-Fi, the light just as you enter the door, etc.... I told the front desk and they sent someone to fix everything. The only thing that really got fixed was the telephone.... which wasn't really needed to begin with, but oh well. The location is perfect because you can walk to most anywhere you want to go, and the Ocean Deck restaurant next door is accessible from the beach, as well, so if you spend a long day at the ocean you can walk right in (bathing suit and all) and grab a bite to eat.

All in all, I would stay again if I got it at the discounted price, but no more than $50 per night. They were also very apologetic about the room mishaps and took the upgrade charges off at once. Clean room, nice pool, tiki bar, ocean view/access.... and if the ocean view isn't cutting it, the handsome security guard will suffice ;) If it weren't for him, I would have left after the second night because the fire alarm in my room decided to go off because of a broken sensor.

(Theoretically AFTER the \u201crenovation\u201d.) Unfortunately, my lodging arrangements were made by the volleyball event that I was working and I didn\u2019t have any choice in the matter. I wasn\u2019t expecting luxury. Being former military, I\u2019ve had to sleep in a hole in the ground that I had to dig before I could \u201ccheck in\u201d. On the positive side, the room temperature was quite pleasant on a chilly winter weekend. There were two Queen-size beds, although that made the rest of the room a bit cramped. And, had my work not kept me away from the room during all daylight hours, I probably would have had a nice view of the Ocean. Of course, if I\u2019d brought anybody along to enjoy a romantic view, they would probably have tossed me off the balcony for selecting such a dump. This hotel\u2019s room style clearly dates back to the 60-70s and hasn\u2019t been updated since. Contrary to the management\u2019s response to earlier negative reviews, there was little \u201cnewness\u201d to our room. There was an abundance of mismatched and clearly used furniture. If management says that the linens & carpet were new, I won\u2019t dispute that. However, it has little impact on the overall impression when the floors are littered with debris from previous occupants in the corners and behind the furniture items. As is typical of old hotels, there were few AC outlets for modern electronics, and at least one of those didn\u2019t work. The lights for the enclosed bathroom and separate vanity area are on the same circuit. So, if you need to use the toilet in the middle of the night, you either need to do it in complete darkness, or turn on a light that can annoy anybody still in bed. The vanity faucet had a single control that would tilt to turn on/off, but would not rotate at all to adjust water temperature. The \u201cfree Internet access\u201d appeared to be some sort of scam. On the first night, we couldn\u2019t even access their wireless network. My call to the front desk brought a practiced \u201cWe don\u2019t know nuthin\u2019 about computers.\u201d When I did eventually connect, it immediately led to a webpage that demanded a virtual biography of personal information. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, it then took you to a second page that demanded credit card information even as it clearly displayed a charge of $0.00 for the service. Momma didn\u2019t raise no stupid children, so I gave them no useful information and was cheated out of the service. Don\u2019t even think about staying in the south wing if you expect to sleep. Friends staying there reported so much noise from motorcycles & barflies that they couldn\u2019t get to sleep until after 3:00 AM. They were on the top floor. So, if it was that loud up there, imagine those with closer rooms . . . The shared kitchen was in fact NOT locked by management. I have no clue who we were sharing with and made no attempt to use the kitchen. I used the built-in lock and had no problem. The icing on the cake was returning to our room following a 14-hour workday, only to discover that housekeeping had never touched the room. Beds unmade, no clean linens; they never even opened the door! When I called down to complain, I was informed that absolutely no employees were on the premises other than the security guard. Apparently this happens quite frequently as he was very proficient at delivering clean linens to our room; lots of practice. Management says that only 2-3 complaints were received that weekend. Maybe if they were actually present they could have heard all the others. There are many nice hotels in the Daytona area, near the airport & race-track, and great bargains can be had through Priceline & Hotwire. If you must stay on/near the beach, then look carefully before you invest a penny. However, if you really want to be within staggering distance of a noisy bar and plan to pass out oblivious to your surroundings, then the Mayan may be for you!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot worth your time and money, beach view was only thing great about it.\u201d", "Author": "MomTo4Cats", "ReviewID": "UR95649141", "Content": "They charge for parking and the room safe.

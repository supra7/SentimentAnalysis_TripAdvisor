They are everywhere in SF, not just on this intersection! Its a big city, go figure! And SF is not a kid-friendly city, so why lug three kids around?

Our experience was so bad, I'm not sure even where to start. I booked my family and I (My husband and three children, ages 1,7,9) online for a four night stay as part of our yearly vacation. I've never stayed here, or at any other Howard Johnson before, but from what I've heard and read, I assumed it would be okay. Ad list free parking, but there is only about 6-8 spots on street level, plus only one way to get in and out. You have to back out into trafic from an enclosed garage. Next, the locked gate to get access to rooms above was broken and did not lock. NOT safe. I requested a non smoking room, and after hauling our children and luggage up a flight of stairs, found we were booked into a smoking room. After complaint, we were moved to the third floor. So after hefting children/bags up another flight of stairs (there's no elevator by the way), our second rm was smoke free. However, moulding was broken off above the door, two of the four lamps in the room did not work, the bathroom must have had at least 2 or 3 different kinds of tiles. There were rips in coverlets and the room just felt unclean. When looking out the window, we could see a huge deserted parking lot, and seperating us was an alley that had all sorts of graffiti, garbage and homeless people. We were literally checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. They refused to give me a full refund, charged me for one nights stay ($125). I wouldn't pay $50 to stay there and i will NEVER stay at a Howard Johnson again because of my experience here.", "Date": "Mar 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR609880393", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "CrystalEyezed"}, {"Content": "Not bad Not bad for a budget hotel. Area isnt as bad as other parts of the city, after all it is San francisco! The hotel is secure, with a security gate at bottom floor to give access to only key holders. (no elevator which is typically expected with smaller hotels i guess) Rooms are clean, impressed with the granite bathroom counter tops. Sink and toilet separate. The rooms arent as big but incorporate all the necessities to make our stary affordable, safe, comfortable and peaceful. The noice wasnt bad at all, surprising we were concerened with the traffic on the streets but actually it stayed quiet and traffic does quiet down after rush hour. Housekeeping friendly. Office staff proficient and friendly, helpful with directions and recommendations. if ur looking for a affordable place to stay this is not a bad choice, I would stay there again.", "Date": "Jan 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR465243398", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SeattleMichelle"}, {"Content": "---- hole There is absolutely nothing good about this hotel.1 - This portion of 9th avenue is an off ramp from 101 freeway. There is so much noice that you cannot sleep.2 - This area of San Francisco is the second worse area (the work being 3 blocks away at 6th). Locals will avise that you do not walk in this neighborhood. There are so many bumbs and destitute people that you will feel unsafe.3 - The management is completely imcompetent. They left my room open for a day by simply failing to close the door. Then I went to the the front desk, they would not even open the door to let me in. I went back to my room (after checking to make sure no one had endered), I called the from desk. Their response to leaving my room open in thids dangerous neifhborhood was that they couldn't understand hor htis had heppened. I received no apology, no promise to prevent this from happening in the future, nothing.I would only stay at this hotel if it was a choice between here or sleeping on the street in a c rappy part of town. As one bartender told me, if the weather is decent, it would be better to sleep in the park that in this neighborhood. When you add the fack that this hotel won't enforce simple safety precautions such as closing door, I would recomment only that the suicidal stay in this hotel.Please note. I haven neer written an online review before. I feel so strongly that this is an unsafe hotel that for the first time I am writing a review in the hopes that no other people need to experiance the fear and discomfort that I have faced the past two nights.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR142788875", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "budget rates i went there and first thought this is the smallest howard johnson i have ever seen. I mean all the surrounding buildings were all compact. I couldn't cancel my reservation so i had no choice but to stay there. The guy at the front desk mike was very nice and he knew the city well. He explained to me places i shouldn't go in the city and places that i should. Frontdesk were very knowledgeable. Secondly, the room was better lookin than the exterior of the hotel..i was suprised they had a little fridge and a microwave..they also had a coffee maker, but they only had put out DECAF coffee..they probably ran out of regular...anyways the room looks like it was remodeled. I felt safe at the hotel knowing that each guest has to go through a gate door only guests staying there who have a key can get up to the rooms. My rate was at $79 bucks.even thou the property is compact..i would definetly go back there again..bad things about the hotel: no elevator, compact place, limited parking spots.

It is a small property! The location is in South of the Market and its not far away from the civic center. Parking is limited but its FREE! try to come early to get the free parking because its first come first serve! This hotel probably gave me the most out of my buck. Rates are budgeted around $50-$90... and the rooms look like their newly remodeled..which included a microwave, refridgerator, and a little cofee maker...their rooms start on the second floor, first floor is all parking...unfortunatly they have no elevators...taking the stairs weren't that bad..but i would prefer an elevator anytime....The hotel also started offering FREE HIGH SPEED INTERNET! they haven't advertised that amenity anywhere on their website or even in their room which i thought was weird.

It is a little unusual in that all the rooms are upstairs (2nd  3rd floors, no elevator) and accessed via a locking gate from the parking area, which is right next to the little office. It's really a tiny and unconventionally laid-out place, with maybe two dozen rooms. All rooms are accessed via outdoor corridors, but these are behind the locked gate and thus presumably safer than the rooms at the Best Western across the street. I don't worry about safety in this area any more than in any other part of town. It's fine during the day but perhaps a bit spooky in the wee hours of the morning, if one is not used to urban areas.The rooms were remodeled 4-5 years ago and are still in pretty good shape. The baths have attractive, polished ceramic tile floors. The tub and commode are fairly nice for a budget hotel. The sink is outside the bath, part of a counter area that has a mini fridge and microwave, as well as a small drip coffee maker. The TV is large and the cable service has a good assortment of channels. Watch out for the in-room phone service, as rather high per minute toll rates can be charged even if one dials a 415 exchange (without a 1 prefix) that is only a few miles away. Check the location of the dialed number carefully, or use a calling card.Bedding and room furnishings are otherwise about what one should expect for $70-$80 in SF. In general things are in good shape and clean appearing.The person on duty appears to live in a two level suite that connects with the office. For several years the same guy, Bob would always be the one to greet me when I checked in, regardless of time of day or day of the week. (I always wondered if he was being held prisoner there!) However Bob seems to have disappeared recently. Nonetheless, my encounters with the staff and housekeeping have always been pleasant here.Parking is free but there are only about 8 or 9 parking spaces; one of those is marked for handicapped use. My experience is that one can usually get a space if one arrives by early evening. Later at night on a weekend would likely be a problem. However, one can park in front of the hotel on the street (metered space) as long as one gets up by 8 AM to feed the meter.This is really a very good choice if one is on a budget, and there really isn't a much better alternative hotel on this side of 5th and Market.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR978221459", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Horrible The room wasnt ready when we arrived, then it was dirty.

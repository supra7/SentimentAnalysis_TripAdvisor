I must say that in my 30 years of planning meetings, this was the best experience I have ever had. This exquisitly maintained/rennovated property built in 1924 has a unique charm and character. The service was above the top on every level. The Sales Manager, Deanna, was extremely accomodating from beginning to end. The Director of Catering, Cynthia, was simply unbelievable. I am extremely picky when it comes to my corporate meetings. She exceeded my expectations on every level, which has never happened. The quality of food as well as the presentation was out of this world. The rooms are so beautiful and beds are top of the line. Eeryone in the hotel bends over backwards to help you and always with a smile. My managers were so impressed with everything. Out of my group of 35 I did not have one complaint. Even the invoice was a breeze being easy to read and very organized and detailed. The location is perfect being 5 minutes away from tons of upscale clubs and restaurants in the prestigious Uptown area.

We had four rooms, one a suite that was large enough for us all to watch the Master's while the babies slept in pack-and-plays in the bedroom, which was wonderfully quiet and dark. All our rooms were spacious and comfortable. We are accustomed to older homes, so we loved the feel of the furnishings. This was our second holiday buffet there and we were not disappointed. Our first trip was last Thanksgiving and the menu was about the same, with an extensive breakfast and all the Easter favorites included. They did run out of crab claws but I think our group put a fairly good dent in the supply. At check-out, I had to tell the front desk that we had swapped chairs, ice buckets, linens and glassware from all the rooms to another and it was all too garbled for us to straighten out... and just like needing to dump smelly trash from our carried-in seafood dinner and baby yuck, the front desk at least acted as if it was their pleasure..such patience!

While I can't speak for the rest of the 60+ nervous examinees scheduled the next day with me, I really didn't gain confidence the night before my big exam from the Black Eyed Peas being pumped at full volume from 6 floors below and the reverberations of the bass into the courtyard. I could hear the DJ word for word despite turning on the AC and putting in ear plugs. When I called the desk, I was told that due to the contract signed with the party group, no control could be exerted on the volume and that I would just have to \"tough it out.\" I was also told that there were no other rooms available in the hotel to which I could be moved to try to get some peace and quiet. I was livid. Despite the lack of a restful night, my exam the next day went fine. Upon check out, I complained again about the combination of a raucous party the night prior to the exam and the manager was very apologetic - to the degree that he comped my room charge in an attempt to make up for the inconvenience. He saved this review from being a 1 star by doing so. Otherwise, the hotel is quite stylish, rooms (I had a King Supreme) spacious and well appointed - the fitness room leaves a lot to be desired - however, the hotel contracts with a huge gym across the street for which they offer $10 day passes. Room service is just above mediocre (unfortunately the hotel restaurant was closed while I was there) All I really needed the night before my exam was a quiet night. I'm still a little flummoxed that the hotel is the host for a huge national exam which likely brings them 2,000+ guests each winter, and yet they were so greedy and short sighted to contract out for a huge party the night before an exam day and which was destined to disturb all of the candidates.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cTradtional Comfort in a Vibrant Neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "DRS_CA", "ReviewID": "UR121681303", "Content": "Even for those used to staying in hip, designer boutique hotels, the understated, traditional charm of the Melrose is refreshing.

This got me a group rate of $185 for my room and I still felt ripped off. There were some positives. The staff was very friendly, for the most part, and tried to be helpful. It is also fairly clean. If you like having a mini-bar, the one in the room was quite extensive and well stocked, and the pillows were especially soft and comfy. There was also good hot water. That is about it for positives. Where do I begin with the drawbacks of this hotel? First, after checking in, we realized the thermostat in our room had dead batteries, one phone was non-functional, and there were lights out. The thermostat was fixed within an hour, the phone never fixed, and the light bulbs changed after about 4 days. Also, they provide your own ice machine in the room... a neat feature... except ours was broken and never fixed or replaced. The location was not great, either. If you want to get downtown you cannot walk and have no easy public transit option. You really need a rental car at this hotel since you are a good distance from most places you will want to go. While it was not a big issue for me, it should be noted that the hotel is also located right in the heart of a vibrant gay community in Dallas. Each night during our stay we observed cross-dressers outside the hotel and were approached about our interest in certain \"shows\" twice. My biggest issue at night was the noise. Even with my room on the top floor, the street noise poured right in. The whole night is filled with sirens, loud honking, people shouting, and so forth. Walls are also very thin. People on our floor were having parties until the early morning hours on two nights and we could hear everything they were doing and saying. The room set-up also seems poor. There is a very nice TV, and it is about 25 feet from the bed and about 18 feet from any sitting area. They put the chairs and bed on the far opposite side of the room, and that made no sense... the remote could not even reach that far so you need to stand up and walk over to the TV if you want to turn the TV on/off, change the volume, or channel. The bathroom was tiny with barely any room for personal items, and a tiny antique shower. Closet space was minimal, with 7 hangers total. I requested two wake-up calls... one came 35 minutes late and the other 20 minutes early. Seriously? Finally, the extra costs are very, very high. Internet is $12 per day, valet parking is your only option and it is $25 per day, and the bar/restaurant are very high-cost. Drinks are about $10 at a minimum and it was $19.70 for a grilled cheese with a cup of tomato soup ($15 + $2 service charge + 18% automatic tip). I just didn't get it. They seem to present themselves as a luxury hotel and certainly charge you a price that reflects it, but I have had much better stays at basic chains like the Holiday Inn, Best Western, or Courtyard. Do not stay at this hotel unless you absolutely need to. I already contacted the heads of this medical conference and advised them to change the hotel next year. For the price you will pay, there are FAR, FAR better options in Dallas or the general DFW area.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cA Last-Minute Success\u201d", "Author": "Lemiracle", "ReviewID": "UR120510890", "Content": "I was sent to Dallas with little notice on a two-day business trip a few years ago. My colleague and I were literally driving into the city from DFW and scrolling through hotel options when we more or less blindly settled on the Warwick Melrose ecause it was fairly near where we needed to be the next day. As it turned out, it was a terrific decision. This was a grand, old hotel, and I appreciated its charming touches. If you're looking for slick, this isn't it. The staff was very friendly, and my room was large, old-fashioned and comfortable. We were in town on a Sunday, and we enjoyed an absolutely delightful brunch in the hotel restaurant. Not only was the food terrific, we soaked up the atmosphere. I distinctly remember a group of gracious women, dressed in their Sunday best after church, celebrating a birthday at the table next to us. They were delightful (their accents too) and we couldn't help but do some eavesdropping. The location was also a nice surprise. The hotel is located near the Oak Lawn and Turtle Creek neighborhoods, a few miles from downtown Dallas. The neighborhoods are affluent and pretty, with several good restaurant options. The first night, we simply walked down the block and found a good Mexican plan, the second, we drove to a fantastic old-school burger joint (alas, the name escapes me). We had a little downtime, and the hotel made a good base of operations to see some sights, including Dealey Plaza and the Book Depository museum, and the Ft. Worth stockyards. Lastly: while I can't promise this always holds true, we were pleasantly surprised to get a very reasonable rate.

I had been planning to stay there for some time as the appeal of the structure seemed inviting. (I have stayed at most area hotels.) I enjoy old hotels and understand that you have to overlook issues with maintenance, but the Warwick needs more attention, both to the structure and the staff for the business traveler. My suite was large, but not in excellent repair. Sure, it had a fresh coat of paint on textured stucco walls (like you see in a cheap remodel) and the decorating style was a bit lost on me. But the living room A/C made so much noise, you could not talk on the phone while it was engaged. The bathroom amenities, towels and linens were of mass-market hotel style, and there were issues with the plumbing and electrical outlets. And, you have to enjoy the flight path from Love Field, which apparently goes right over the hotel. The friendliness of the staff escaped me on this trip as there was barely a word uttered in my direction, even when ordering at the Library Bar.

The valet, reception and bar staff were some of the best I have come across, and this is based on stays at hotel chains such as Fairmont, Ritz Carlton, MGM Resorts and many other fine hotels all over the world where I have traveled with my family growing up. The beds were beyond comfortable also. I can honestly say that I was 110% happy with my stay at the Warwick, and if I had not had to leave and return home, I would not have! I would absolutely choose this hotel as my chain of choice if there was one in any of my future destinations. The bonus point was that the group rate for the wedding was unbelievably affordable for me. Unfortunately, based on the regular rates, I would likely not be able to afford to stay in the same choice of room for more than a night or two in the future if I was not to travel with my wealthier family :-( But I am glad that I was able to experience it, as it made me want to come back to Dallas very soon, and absolutely back to the Warwick if funds allow.

When we arrived at the hotel, the valet parker was very nice and welcomed us. Check in was very quick and friendly...maybe 5 minutes at the most and they explained a lot about the hotel during that time. The room was large and nice. Obviously, we had a king size bed. Comfy bed. Bath robes and coffee maker....thank goodness for the coffe maker because I have to have my morning coffee. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and the food was fantastic. Not too expensive...I would say about $50 per person but we did have wine and that does add to the bill. The bar was quite busy for a Saturday night. We didn't go in but we stood outside and listened to the singer who was great...not sure what her name was but I would love to go back just to hear her sing again. Off to bed. Room service for breakfast and it was really good. I had pancakes and wife had fruit. Hot and fresh and the waiter was very nice. Checked out and home we went. I just have to say that the hotel was really great and very nice and beautiful. We got a deal at $169 per night and it was worth every penny.

This is the hotel they want you to stay at the days prior to your examination. If you are coming in for ACOG, get some ear plugs because the street noise can be loud. We heard airplanes and ambulances on and off during our stay. It was not enough to ruin anything, but just a note. If you blink you are going to miss that this is a hotel. As many reviewers have said, this is an older builiding, and blends wonderfully with the surroundings. We had no doubt this used to be a swanky place to live. I was very impressed with the grand feel. The parking lot sits behind the hotel, and they only have valet. There is free parking on the narrow street that lines the hotel if you are brave. We were not. I can mostly comment on the rooms as we did not dine at the restaurant or visit the bar. The rooms were large and had nice seating areas and spacious bathrooms. One note of caution, the hot water in the sink gets extremely hot. I would not be surprised if guests have been burned. That can be dangerous for kids who turn on the hot water first before the cold. The beds were comfortable and there were flat screen Tvs. There is an IPOD docking station which made having great music easy! They had in room coffee makers and a mini bar. For you coffee drinkers, my mom did note that the creamer was not up to the level of a fine hotel-they could do better than the powdered stuff. We took the items out and used the fridge for our things. There was a large selection of free TV channels and lots of choices for paid entertainment. I was with my kids so it was nice to know that they had several episodes of kids' television shows and movies to offer. We eyed the room service menus and thought it was overpriced. No matter, we were 3 blocks away from one of my favorite places to eat-Eatzis. Its kind of a gourmet take away place where you can get fresh, hot food as well as made to order sandwhiches and salads. Walgreens is right across the street for any items you may have forgotten. The location is convenient to the expressway, about 2 minutes from 35E. In summary, this is a nice hotel and I would not mind staying here again. I do have a preference for newer things, so even with the remodel, I would prefer a newer, more modern hotel.

The only real complaint we had was that we could hear the activity in the adjoining room, probably through the connecting door, and next time I would ask for a room without one. We were on the back side of the hotel, so the street noise was at a minimum.

Yes, the service was impeccable, the bathroom amenities were upscale, and the piano bar was quite nice but the room was in desperate need of a serious overhaul. I felt like I was staying at an old great aunt's slightly smelly, threadbare house. I tend to like old hotels with a lot of character and have never had trouble before but the suite at the Melrose was tired and run down. The sofa and arm chairs were faded, frayed, and shabby looking. The mattress was soft and the bedspread and decorative pillows in need of replacement. Most unpleasant was the very noticeable musty smell in the room that would not go away. If you have allergies to mold I would think twice about staying here. To be honest I am surprised at the high marks given by the tripadvisor reviewers. I wouldn't call the hotel a \"dump\" but if you want upscale luxury that sparkles choose somewhere else.

I was trying to decide between Melrose and Renaissance Market Center. Based on reviews here, I booked this hotel. The positives: The staff is friendly and attentive. I have no complaints, superior service A++++. I forgot my tootbrush and they promptly brought one to my room, room service is VERY fast. The rooms are HUGE compared to a standard room. The bathroom is very big. Order the Belgium waffles for breakfast as they are fantastic. Across from a Walgreens which is convenient if you need some necessities. Free wireless access in the lobby, but $10 a day in your room. The negatives or neutrals: The hotel is not really near anything. They advertise that they are near the upscale Turtle Creek neighborhood, which is really nothing spectacular. In fact, I did not feel safe walking around the corner. There is very limited food selection for room service and it is a bit more expensive than some other hotels I have stayed. So you have to go and eat. As I do not rent a car, I have to eat close by. There are no good places to eat in walking distance. There is a cool little vegetarian place called the Cosmic Cafe around the corner that's about it. Also the West Village shopping center 5 minutes away is nothing great. Though I did get great Tirmasu at an Italian place there. Pay the extra cabfare and go to the Galleria Mall or if you want upscale shopping go to Highland Park I am always leery of cleanliness in older hotels. The bathroom tub really needed a good scrubbing with comet. And there was this glob of what probably looked like soap on the bathroom floor. I kept meaning to complain about this but did not have time. And yet the tub never got cleaner and the mystery glob stayed on the bathroom floor the 5 days I was there. The work desk area is poorly lit. There needs to be a light behnd you to illuminate this area more. So at night it is difficult to work at the desk. Fairly limited number of TV stations compared to other hotels. And the workout area consists of the typical hotel equipment, meaning a few cardio machines. Nothing extraordinary. Some members of the room service staff have trouble speaking/understanding English. Twice when I have called they needed someone to call me back who understood me. But to be fair, I was called back right away. The library bar is cool, but drinks are over priced. The Landmark restaurant is very pricey also, and since I did not eat there I cannot comment on the food. I wouldn't say not to stay at this hotel as my stay certainly was not a negative one, however, I would not necessarily recommend it either. If you are looking for things to do, stay at downtown hotel. I had colleagues who stayed at the downtown Hyatt and the Hilton Anatole who said they were fantastic.

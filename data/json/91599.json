Day 1, as soon as I walked in the room there was a funky dirty gym bag smell (It took me three days to figure out it was one of the chairs) and I found dirty dishes in the cabinets. Not dishes with dust- flat out grease and old food stuff on the dishes and placed in the cabinets. The bathtub had caked on grime, the towels were not only greying but were torn in places. The only time my room was vacuumed was when I complained. The really annoying thing was that this hotel is suppose to be eco friendly but they kept changing out my towels even though I hung it up. This continued on the the duration of my stay (over three weeks). I strongly recommend a different hotel.

I am a seasoned business traveller, and have stayed in hotels all over the world. I usually look forward to staying in a Marriott chain hotel because of the reliability of quality. This particular hotel was a total diappointment. The hotel is situated at the intersection of a highway (I-70) and a major roadway. The Indianapolis airport is adjacent to the hotel and guests of the hotel can hear planes all night long, in addition to the traffic on the neighboring highway/ roadway. The surrounding neighborhood is not nice, to say the least, which lead to me (a female traveller), not feeling comfortable leaving the hotel after dark. Loud, \"souped up\" cars were going up and down the main road (Lyndhurst) all night long. To summarize the negative aspects I experienced during my 6-day stay at the hotel: no hot water for a shower on morning number 1 (which also happened to 3 other co-workers I was travelling with), a very noisy room on night one, after which I requested to be moved (after a series of miscommunications with the front desk staff, to include giving me a key to a new room in which another guest was already checked in), I was moved to a somewhat quieter room. In the new room, the dishwasher was broken, as was the latch door lock, the shower curtain, and the coffee maker (which overflowed during brewing). In addition, the hotel rooms are not laid out like typical Residence inn's, with two separate rooms. Rooms at this hotel are not divided, and the hotel actually consists of two separate buildings- separated by a parking lot, which further aggrevated safety concerns for me personnally. The hot food at breakfast was continuously running out and the property seemed, overall, to be older and not well maintained. This was a major disappointment for a Marriott stay. On a positive note: breakfast staff was very friendly, as was the evening \"happy hour\" staff, which served guests willingly and went above and beyond.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "3tonkies", "ReviewID": "UR72739411", "Content": "After staying in a Residence Inn the night before in Syracuse NY, I found this location lacking. I travel with pets and have no issue with non-refundable pet fees in order to be able to stay in a nice, clean, room. This room was gross. The hallway outside smelled of dog pee. My dogs were all over the room sniffing at the carpet, and found something interesting, dried dog poop droplets, embedded in the carpet. They weren't large, but still....nasty Then I found dog poop behind the bedroom door. Socks under the bed, lipstick on the glasses, all in all an experience I don't want to relive. i notified the evening desk clerk about my dissatisfaction, she apologized. In retrospect, I wish I would've asked for another room, but having driven 12 hours I was a little brain dead and just wanted to go to sleep. I told her I didn't mind the dog fee, but expected a clean room. I also complained at check out, and she expressed concern, stating she would speak with the manager and to expect that my pet fee would be refunded. I appreciate that greatly, but would have been happier paying the $100 and getting a room that wasn't nasty. I called the manager this morning, and she was very responsive. She had already refunded my $100, and had spoken with the contractor they use to sanitize the room., so while my experience wasn't good, I will say that the manager's response was terrific. She appreciated the comments and said that they become a better hotel by guests letting them know when they fall short. That's the right answer!

However, little did I know I was booking a night when there was a big football game in town and the hotel was absolutely packed. Upon check-in the girl at the front desk switched my rooms, saying there had been some last minute changes... When I got into my room I saw it was a handicapped room and a heinous one at that. Why should handicapped people be assigned to such ugly rooms? Not only did it have an unfinished look, but there were odd, uneven RUTS in the floor, something I've never really seen before...couldn't something like that cause problems for a wheelchair? I can't imagine what these wide ruts are caused by???? The bathroom was something like I've seen in third world countries- it was as if the whole room was one big shower, the floor slanting towards a giant drain in the center, and a pathetic dribbling showerhead that hits me in about the middle of my chest. About 3 AM I was awakened by furious pounding on the ceiling and sounds of water running, and this went on until about (exactly) 4:42 AM. I know because I was kept awake that entire time, even with a pillow over my head. WHAT were they doing up there? Maybe because there was a big football game there was a party going on involving lots of showering? The bottom line IMHO is that it should NOT have been that loud and clear in my room what my neighbors were up to, if only my SPRINT PCS phone connection was that crystal clear! The walls in this room are wayyyy too thin! Now's it's almost 6 AM and I'm wide awake- I suppose it's a benefit that I'll get an early start on my day.

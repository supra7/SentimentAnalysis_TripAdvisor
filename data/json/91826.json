My wife and I have stayed in sixteen hotels in Vegas, and this was the worst. We can see past the construction, the small room, the door hitting my knee when my wife opened the bathroom door, but we could not overcome the smell. The hallway and room smelled like a dirty nursing home. We left the hotel and got a room somewhere else due to the aroma. So, technically I did not stay in the hotel because the smell was so bad we could not. Even for free, it was not worth it. Did I mention the air conditioning was also not working? I was told it was b because the temperature kept fluctuating outside so they did not have it on. Honestly. This was the worst hotel I have ever been to or attempted to stay in while traveling to Vegas. Do not stay here.

The check in was easy and no elevator line (we checked in around 5 PM on a Thursday) but once we made it to the room I wanted to run and not come back. The carpet was dirty, the bathroom looked like it belonged in some horror movie about a European hostel, and the tub looked like it was left over from the original 1906 rooms. The noise from Fremont was booming (yes I expected this) but I didn't expect our windows to have broken latches so that they opened a little more with each bass boom. We are night owls in Vegas so by the time we got back to our room after dinner and gambling at 4:30 AM the noise on Fremont was gone, but cut to 4 hours later and the music was back playing over loud speakers. Who's awake at 8:30 AM in Vegas?! The worst part of this room was the shower. Stained, no mat in the bottom or grip stickers so I had to curl my toes to keep from slidding around, and the shower curtain was so moldy that I serioulsy wanted to throw up after touching it on accident. How hard is it to change a moldy shower curtain?! So gross. If we had been there for more than 2 nights I would have moved hotels. I gave it 3 stars because the casino and 24 hour diner are redeeming qualities and frankly, it was free so I can't hate on it too much. We will give the expansion a try after it opens, but I might pack my own shower curtain, just in case.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "saskatoon", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "kev8971", "ReviewID": "UR125963970", "Content": "Nice clean newly done boutique style rooms.

The latest scam the hospitality industry is foisting on us is resort fees. Watch for these any time you book.THERE ARE NO RESORT FEES HERE !!! TAKE THIS REVIEW W GRAIN OF SALT. I Stayed here on 12/27/11 , this is a time when Vegas catches its' breath just before New Years Eve. It is quieter, less crowded, and expensive than most other times of the yr. U may have a less pleasant experience when u visit at peak times. There is a also remodel/ expansion underway, I did not experience any probems because of this. This might change as work continues, one of the workers told me it would be June of 2012 before the work is completed. My room was 345, it faced Main St .I did not experience any internal noise from other rooms but I coud hear the muted sounds from the Fremont St. Experience along w some traffic noise from Main St. This is a free (except for New Years Eve) light and sound show that takes place nightly.There is a canopy over the street imbeded w millions (literally) of lights on which images are projected in concert w a very loud sound show. I imagine it could get quite loud, especially if you stay toward the front of the hotel.I think the last show ends at midnight. Was never concerned about safety, the riff raf that used to frequent the area has been chased away.There is a lobby guard at night, visitors must sign in. TV remote did not work (batteries?) other than that, everything worked liked it was supposed to. Temperatures were comfortable in room and common areas despite 35 degree outside night temps. Some smoke in the casino, none in the room. Coud sense cooking smells in 3rd floor lobby, but not in room. There was some dirty grout in the base of the shower and some balled- up papers in drawer, otherwise , place was clean. Staff was friendly ,especially the valets and the 7pm server and mgr at Dupars restaurant. Ez check in/out, very low tech . At check in desk, they have a mail cubbyhole for each room . This place is fairly typical for the area.It has only 4 floors ( they are adding more) Properties on Fremont are smaller, older,w far fewer bells/whistles than their strip counterparts . There was only valet parking ( they were fast/friendly ) no pool. gym, spa, business center, babysitting, arcade, concierege, buffet, news stand , gift shop , sports book or showroom . There was ice/ vending,a Dupars Deli where they serve their famous shrimp cocktail ( it is no longer 99 cents) The Dupars restaurant/bakery is open 24/7, serves good comfort food, huge quantities , w GREAT service at fair prices. There were many locals there who come here just for the food. I was alone, did not have to wait, just sat at the counter. Looks like they are going after the younger demographic, many of the dealers were young women in sexy outfits , some danced when they are not dealing. During my stay, most of the other patrons were in their 50's.They have a slot club, no charge to join. Nice bar/friendly staff. Room looked just like the website picture, but it is SMALL ,maybe 125 sq feet. Watch the small step from room to bathroom, you could trip. Bathroom had shower stall, no tub. Vanity area not separate from shower area w no hair dryer, there were some toiliteries. Small closet w no iron/ board, there is a safe in the lobby. No desk, there is a fee for wireless, there is a computer in the lobby (not free) There is a flat screen TV, clock radio w ipod dock, phone w v/mail. Phone says there is a charge for local calls, desk clerk says it is free. There is a cofee maker and snack basket ( not free) bed was comfy, sheets were clean. Place looks like it's ok if you are disabled , but no pets are allowed. There is stuff to do here. Fremont was the main street in Vegas. It is now an open air mall where the nightly light/sound show takes, there are also shops, bars, restaurants, small casinos and hotel/ casinos. There are kiosks selling cell phones, etc, street performers, and a zip line ride. Looks like they are adding theaters on the east end. Newest eatery addition is the Heart Attack Cafe, its sells HUGE burgers ( 1 has 6000 calories) There's an ambuance out front, the servers wear sexy nurse outfits, if you weigh over 350 lbs, you eat free.There are lost of other places to dine that won't stress out your cardiologist. Across the street, the ex mayor has old style steak house w a Rat Pack vibe. Further to the west, there is some kind of huge trade center, I did not get a chance to go there. Go south on Main, you will find the arts district that includes the Smith Center and some antique places. East on Fremont and north on LV Blvd you will find a neon sign museum ( closed when I was there), an under construction gangster museum, the Cashman Convention Ctr, a natural history and kids discovey center museum. The LV Area 51's AAA baseball team in the PCL plays here too. Go south on LV Blvd and you will find Govt buildings,wedding chapels, antique and pawn shops ( Pawn Stars place is here, line to enter was huge ) Nearest big Strip place is the Stratosphere which is couple of miles so of Fremont /LV BL. Hotel is close to all freeways. Greyhound Stops at the Plaza Hotel across the St. Amtrak bus ( no trains stop in LV anymore) stop here too. A little south on Main is the RTC terminal. from here, U can get all over LV on the clean/economical bus system. Some run 24/7. 2 lines run directly to the airport. There is a double deck ( the Deuce) and an articulated bus that runs on LV Bl , this is a good way to check out the strip wo driving. It is $2 a pop to ride, if u plan to get on/off, get a day pass. It's not fast, Strip traffic is always bad, use side streets or the fwy if you drive or are in a hurry.Some Strip hotels have rear entrances. Not sure what a cab/limo would cost to get to the Strip or airport. Check Bell Trans or Grayline . Was here to see the LV Wranglers ECHL hockey team play at the Orleans Hotel Arena. This is 2 miles west of LV Bl on Tropicana . Very modern/ clean facility w no bad seats. Reasonable ticket prices and unique intermission entertainment. One time, the Blue Man Group did a mini show. The game I went to this time started at midnight. Team is usually competitive, they were in 1st place when I was there. They are NHL Calgary's farm team. Paid $39 , they put a $100 deposit on your reservation that is voided if you do not trash the room . No frequent customer program. NO RESORT FEES! The Gate is the oldest place in town, it is small and well maintained, but has few extras. There is a a remodel/ expansion in progress until June, 2012. Did not mind staying here, I do not linger in my room when I travel.

What a cost it was to me overall. The valet stuck his hand in the little console shelf on my car looking for money, and he broke the little plastic door. I'm so glad I don't keep money in the car, but I was furious. Despite the fact that I spoke with the security person and the manager of the hotel right on the valet lot as soon as I discovered this, the hotel has denied responsibility, of course. Toyota would like $375.00 to fix this, as the entire console front must be replaced. Then we get to the room.... The strange little annoying coffee maker (at $1.50 per cup) was impossible to figure out. There are no useful directions, and I had to call Housekeeping to get someone to explain it to me. The man who came up said he goes to four or five rooms per week to explain the silly machine. What a poor use of an employee's time. The room was very very tiny, requiring holding one's breath to get between the bed and the wall. Fremont Street makes a lot of noise, but if you're in a rear room, it's tolerable. The hotel corridors are rather strange, and the hotel is quite old, but both those things one can live with. What I cannot accept is the hotel not even offering to share the cost of my damaged console. The manager said, when we discussed the damage, that he could think of \"a few different scenarios\" to explain my broken console door. To me, this implies that I was a scammer. Not likely, since I am a teacher, and my 14-year old granddaughter was with me. Another scenario might be that the aliens came down and did this? Never, never, never again at this hotel. If you do stay there, for whatever reason, park across the street at the Las Vegas Club's valet parking. It's an easy walk across the street.

We found a very low rate and decided to stay on Freemont Street for the first time, knowing that there would be a big difference from the Strip hotels. I relied on tripadvisor reviews, and let me tell you...I was still pretty shocked. Lets start with the positives: Easy check in-the valet service was a nice touch and the attendants always ask if you will be going out again, so your car will be easily accessible. The check in staff was awesome..the lady at the counter was funny, friendly and very helpful. I needed an iron and she got me one right away. The shrimp cocktails are as great as everyone says..readily available and super cheap!!! The restaurant was also a nice surprise..a great retro feel with great breakfast choices. Had some luck in the casino. The cons: The elevator smells like vomit and urine. It lingered the whole time we were there. The evening we arrived there was a drunk puking in the check in lobby. Seriously, just GROSS. The hallways are SCARY. Our room was tucked away in a corner that my husband affectionately named \"murder alley\". Creepy..seriously very creepy. The room we had was TINY. I knew from reviews it would be small. But I was still amazed at the smallness of the bed. It wasn't a full..I don't know what size it was, but my husband and I barely fit, and we are fairly short! There was a hole in the baseboard that reminded us of the holes you see in cartoons for mice. We covered it and I had dreams of Tom and Jerry all weekend. The bathroom was so tiny that when I leaned over to brush my teeth, I slammed into the towel rack; I'm only 5 ft 4!! Sitting on the toilet is a challenge-again, cramped. The shower stall tiles are retro and not in a good way. The look DINGY AND DIRTY. There is zero lighting in the shower stall-which makes for a scary, scary shower and there were tiny flies all over the interior of the shower ceiling. The pacing of the shower?? good luck. Either scalding hot or freezing cold. The room itself was nicely updated. Very pretty sheets, bedding, nice tv, great drapes. There was a Keurig coffee machine, but you have to pay for the coffee, which I did not do. I chose to walk to Dunkin Donuts at the 4 queens instead. It was loud..you're on Freemont. Don't expect quiet and you won't be disappointed in the noise level. I wasn't bothered by it. Maybe some of the rooms are bigger and cleaner.

I have stayed there the last 3 times that I have been to Vegas. There is diffenently pros and cons to staying at the Golden Gate. I feel in love with the place about 4 years ago,but at the time I didn't stay there,and had no plans on ever staying there due to the fact a lot of working girls was hanging out there. About 2 years ago I noticed that the girls were no longer there. I talked to a couple of the managers, and they informed me that they were in the process of cleaning things up. Ever since that point I now stay there. I do agree the Golden Gate can and is very loud during the FSE light show, but there are ways around it. I have stayed in the rooms facing Fremont Street, and rooms that are in the middle of the hotel. The rooms in the middle is much more quite, but the view is looking at a roof. IMHO if you are staying in Vegas on Fremont then you really aren't planning in staying in your room much. The biggest plusses for me when I stay at the GG is that the windows open. Being from WI when I visit in late Feb or March the rooms are to warm. I found that at the GG and in the hotels I have stayed at on the strip,and I truely believe that customer service is the highest priority to the management. I had a dealer tell me that he had dealt at a number of casinios and the GG encourge the dealers to talk and be friendly to the players if only 1 or 2 players are sitting at the table, again IMO it seems most of the other casinos I have been in wants to deal as fast as they can to get more money out of you when you are the only one at the table,and those casinos treat you as a \"dollar\" not a customer. It seems as the GG wants you to enjoy yourself as you lose your money. For me that is fine because I keep coming back. Yes the rooms are small,but remember the building is over 100 yrs old,and if you are lucky they do have some bigger rooms. I stayed in one of the bigger rooms in this trip. It is also tucked in a corner that you can hardly hear any noise even when the FSE is going on.I will let you find out for yourself which one that is due to the fact that I will be requesting it from now on.If I had to find one major fault with the GG is that it can be an adventure to take a shower.The first two times I stayed there the water presure and temp was unreliable.This trip I had no problems, but again the room I was staying in seemed as if it wasn't as \"old\". Also myself I feel it would be hard to justify tearing out all the plumbing to fix this problem. IMO it is part of the charm. For us 50+ yrs old,we grew up with plumbing like this even in the fanciest homes. I hope this helps, call me a little old fashion but the customer service given from the house keeper all the way up to the owners ( yes you do see the owners and upper managment walking around and chatting up all the customers not just the big spenders) asking how things are and if you need anything will keep me coming back.

The have go-go type dancers that perform inbetween the table games. on busy nites they have 3 or 4 cocktail servers that make sure you don't go thirsty. And this for a casine with about 300 slots and about 20 table games!!! Also I find my money lasting longer here than other casinos. Comps for food and rooms are easy to come by.

I have stayed here twice before, and it is even better than before. I arrived at about 9PM on Monday, and I was assigned to room 411. I had been used to the very small standard rooms, but this top-floor room was surprisingly large! It was clean and well-equipped. Room 411 was in the southeastern corner of the hotel; this room was the farthest from the Fremont Street sound and from the sounds of Main Street. I personally would have preferred to have a room in the front, overlookng the Fremont Street pedestrian mall (party zone), but room 411 is perfect for those who want quiet. The PRICE is definitely right here, and the value is amazing. If I had advance notice of my trip, I could have gotten this room for $19.70 per night (Fremont Street's \"Summer of the 1970s: theme), but I got a $28 per night rate, with 24 hours notice. Excellent! I only used the room for sleep/shower/storage, so why spend more? When it comes to FUN, Golden Gate and the Fremont Street Experience have it figured out! Every evening, the casino was packed with players and partiers. By comparison, the Vegas Club and the Plaza casinos looked tired and quiet. Blackjack is 3:2 (yay!) with a $5 minimum, even at peak hours! The machines are good, although I could not find any full-pay video poker (the Four Queens has it, just two blocks away). There was a techno-pop DJ in front of the Gate each night, leading an active dance floor. There were Golden Gate dealer-entertainers at the BJ tables and serving drinks at the bar out front. Search YouTube for \"Golden Gate Dancing Dealers\" to check it out. I have never seen a better casino atmosphere, in 25 years of Vegas travels. As I mentioned, the theme on Fremont Street is \"Summer of the 1970s\", so there are disco bands and 1970s tribute acts everywhere on \"The Street\", as well as celebrity look-alikes. I saw \"Captain Jack Sparrow\", \"Bret Michaels\", \"Gene Simmons\", and \"Prince\". The FSE was packed each night. When you visit the Golden Gate, be sure to shoot dice with the regular dealers, too. They are very professional, even though they are \"in the shadow\" of the dancing-girl BJ dealers. I also wish that the piano player would return; I know that the dancing dealers' music would drown out the piano, so maybe the pianist can play in the afternoons...? I miss the old \"Bandit Pianist\", who led the crowd in a few barroom songs. Club 1906 is a good slot/player's club. Get your card when you're there, and you'll get good e-mail offers for your next trip. There is no pool, nor fitness center, but there is a good restaurant and a great snack bar. The former Bay City Diner and the snack bar are a bit more expensive now that they are run by DuPar's, but they are still very good. The parking in the back is valet only; a $2 tip ensures excellent service. To all of those STRIP-junkies: there was no line when I checked in, and there were two attendants. During the trip, I visited the MGM Grand (to play Sigma Derby and the Lion's Share Progressive), and I saw over two hundred sad people, suffering in a check-in line. Not for me. Housekeeping was excellent; my room was kept very well (by \"Maria\", I think). I did notice that the water temperature seems to \"be haunted\". I got used to it. I will be back to the Golden Gate.

There is tile everywhere and the grout is stained. I did experience in the shower the hot and cold. Oh my, it was awful on our first morning. Started out fine, soaped up, freezing cold water comes out, then burning hot. Took forever to finish. It was chilly in our room but could not get any heat. I don't know if they shut it off, or if it is broken. The noise, this rooms looks out onto Fremont street which is really neat. The windows fully open so you can hang your head outside. But... Last year we thought the noise from the light show was loud. This year there was a man singing all night long. He would stop for the lightshow and then start up again. You had to have the tv on full blast to hear it. It was not good at all. There was no escaping the noise. On our last night, we decided we needed some peace, could not stand the noise anymore, and switched to a room on the Main St. side. This was a smaller room and much more quiet. We could still hear everything from Fremont St. but it was much better. When we checked out we asked to have a room not on Fremont street for our next stay in a week. We were given room 410. This was a larger room, the same nice decor and comfy beds. The bathroom was a little larger but still needed redone. This bathroom didn't seem as clean. It also had a vanity area outside of the bathroom. There was a desk in this room. I guess this room is on the alley. In the evening the room was quiet. My mom woke up to the noise from the alley. I slept through it. Still love it but would not get a room on Fremont Street, doesn't sound like it's going to be quiet there.

The theme as they say is turn-of-the-century San Francisco. So those of you expecting opulent suites with enough room to hold a WWE match can skip out of here. If you've ever been to a hotel in a major city like San Fran, Chicago, NYC, etc. you know those rooms can be pricey and small anyway. Well, these rooms are just as comparable in size but way cheaper. The remodeling is very nice with the basic amenities taken care of (comfortable bed, nice LCD TV, clean bathroom w/soap & shampoo, etc.). They don't have hair dryers and ironing boards/irons in every room, but you can get them from the front desk (we brought our own dryer so not sure about that being lent out). My only issue with the room itself was the windows. They still have the swing-open-to-the-side, thin & single-pane ones. Hopefully after enough revenue from the new upgrades, these can be completed in phase 2. Keep in mind, this is a 100+ year old hotel, you can only upgrade so much at a time without tearing the whole place down. The restaurants were pretty easy as well. There's a deli in the back serving simple snacks, sandwiches and their famous shrimp cocktail. To the street-side they have their diner with counter service (a plus) and your standard diner entrees for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Only setback is that neither is open 24/7 nor do they offer room service, but the deli is at least open to the wee hours. Again, maybe something for phase 2. Then comes the casino/bar. Since this is a small space, they split the room to a machine/table ratio of about 50/50. The machines are standard game variety of penny-to-mid-dollar bet range and the tables are $10 min Blackjack and $5 minimum roulette. They're following the trend where peak-gaming hours have friendly-yet-spunky go-go-dancer ladies who are also professional dealers. I like this trend (it keeps the tables full) and the gals look very attractive and are not some fake-sculpted lingerie model with no soul. Add a friendly bar staff and you've got yourself a great deal for the room price. I mean come on, who stays in the room anyway?

I was assigned to Room 232. It was a small, quaint room with a nice flat screen tv and very clean. I went out for dinner and some fun and got back to the room sometime around 11pm. As I was trying to sleep I could hear loud music and actually feel the vibrations coming from the sound. As it turned out, they have go-go dancers at the blackjack tables which happens to be directly below Room 232. I'm happy to see go-go dancers, but the loud music they were dancing to made it impossible to sleep. I drifted asleep a couple of times, but kept waking up. Finally, just before 2am I got dressed and went down and requested another room. I was advised they didn't have any, but could request a different room the next day. It was a Friday night. I walked over to the 4 Queens and Vegas Club just to see if I could get a room and some sleep. They were booked to capacity. When I returned to the Golden Gate the loud music had finally stopped (sometime shortly after 2am). The next day they were very accomodating and moved me to a room on the 3rd floor, across from the Plaza Hotel. There was still traffic sounds at night, but very tolerable compared to the first night.

We stayed at the Lady Luck and the Plaza Hotel and Casino before. The motels/hotels in the old Downtown Vegas are not very luxurious, and most of the people staying there are certainly on a budget or simply don't like spending too much $$$ on a hotel room. Parking at the Golden Gate is pretty limited - they only have valet parking which is free but you have to tip the person working over there. The staff was friendly and helpful - we were able to choose our room. The room we stayed in was small, cozy, with a modern feel to it. It looked like the room had recently been renovated. My husband thought it \"too small\" but since I am from Europe I am used to small motel/hotel rooms. Like I said, all we needed was a room with a bed and a bathroom. The bathroom was small, but clean. That's all that mattered to me. As for the bed, the mattress was pretty soft, so if you like soft plush mattresses, good for you. We prefer hard beds, but then again, everybody is different. As for food, they have a deli downstairs in the casino. The sandwiches were pretty goood, we had one when we got hungry in the middle of the night. There's not really more to say, I would not recommend this place for a family with young children, since the rooms are really small.

The first thing to say, is that value wise it's hard to imagine a better deal. We paid $23 the first two stays for smoking rooms including a Friday night, and $47 the third time in a non-smoking room. The non-smoking room we stayed in was a lot smaller for some reason, though still very adequate. If you like big bathrooms, you will be dissapointed, but if you like more than enough space to get clean, then at this price you wont be bothered. The shower's are fitted with soaking plates and there was always steaming hot water. Complimentary bottles and bars of Neutragena shampoo & soap are a nice touch. The smoking rooms do really smell of smoke - sounds obvious, but these days it's increasingly unusual for smoking to be permitted in enclosed spaces and you really notice it at first. Soon got used to it though. The beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows. The rooms have been re-fitted and the deco style furniture and lamps compliment the set up. New flat screen TV's, large side boards and plenty of hanging space tucked away in a 'built in' cupboard behind the door are all useful, pleasing additions. Location wise, the hotel is obviously on Fremont. Personally, I love this area of Vegas - it has a vibe all of it's own, like a self contained, super laid back mini Vegas community with no hint of pretension. If you want to get to the strip, it's fairly easy to shuttle up and down on the bus, but if you're only going in once a day and you're not alone, a taxi is a much better bet. We ate their on our last night - just cold food, but really good. I was especially suprised by the 99c shrimp cocktail (join the 1906 club for free play and food deals), and the beef sandwich was melt in the mouth. There's always a queue but it moves quick and reassures you of the quality and freshness. If you just want the shrimp cocktail, go straight to the cashier. Tables are good fun and during the day you can get $3 Blackjack play, $5 upward at night. Some of the slots are tucked away a bit tired, but the bar is a good place to kick back and watch the action. Staff wise, apart from one grumpy valet, all very helpful, polite and courteous. Noise wise, we had no complaints, but I gues if you went to bed before the last Fremont Experience light show (about 1am at weekends), you probably will be bothered, but no more so than many hotel rooms on Fremont.

The hotel is right on Freemont Street and the Bay City Diner downstairs was my favorite place to eat in all of Las Vegas, so I had to eat tere twice. You can't beat the price or the quality of the food. I had a huge bowl of pasta for $5.99 and a large salad for $6.99 which would have cost more than $13 anywhere else. The strip is fun, but if you want something more low-key check out Downtown las Vegas and stay at the Golden Gate.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice for the Price...\u201d", "Author": "Opusnight", "ReviewID": "UR34915390", "Content": "Stayed midweek and only paid $19 per night!

It shows that they spent some good money to make it nicer but fell short of going all the way (flat-panel televisions [but only a dozen channels]; Neutrogena bath products [but never replaced the old tile floor]; nice new credenza for the TV [but an empty mini-closet for a fridge]). Still has window AC units, but they really keep the room cool. Beds were comfortable with new linens; a little soft for my taste, but certainly comfortable. The room overall was very tiny, but that is typical of a hotel that is over 100 years old - and after all, why do you need a lot of room when you're in Vegas? Bathroom also was tiny, but the shower stall was nice - tiled from floor to ceiling, good showerhead. Cannot beat the location, right at the end of Fremont Street.

She was impressed enough that we booked 4 nights there for our June Vegas getaway. Our room must have been one of the best in the house, it was plenty big enough, and we had a birds eye view of Freemont street and Main street. If you book there, ask for room 404. It is the corner room on the top floor, overlooking Freemont and Main streets. Both the hotel and Casino staff were very friendly, the restaurants have great specials, and you are within walking distance to all that downtown has to offer. This is an old hotel, with a lot of charm and character,but because it is so old there are some problems. The shower has decent pressure, but the water temp can fluctuate without warning, so at times you have to be quick on your feet! Also, the lone elevator is a bit slow and clunky, but there are only 4 floors, so taking the stairs is a a quicker option.

It's located under the canopy on Fremont Street and in a very safe area. It's at the end of the street next to Main Street. I had a pullman suitcase and had no trouble walking there from the bus stop at 4th and Fremont. My first impressions when walking into the hotel/casino is that it was dark but I liked the feel of the place. It was old(built in 1906) but in very good shape, spotless and didn't smell funky. There were also plenty of security people at all times. I don't see any hotel signs and roamed around to a dead end to the Bay City Diner. Back I go and then find the Deli with the .99 Shrimp Cocktail. You need a players card to get this deal and although I don't eat seafood, they looked like a good deal for those that like the little crustaceans. The cocktails are large as they are served in a parfait glass. I see some people happily gobbling theirs and am surprised at how big they are(the cocktails, not the diners). Too bad I can't eat seafood or it would be a great deal. What I really want it the check-in but I can't seem to find the desk and finally have to ask. The officer points back to the deli and I see the hotel desk is actually through a doorway right by the deli. How did I miss it? It's big enough. The registration is a nice quiet area with some comfy antique looking seats for you to sit if you need to wait or look for wallet etc. Lots of wood paneling(not that icky 60's stuff. It's nice wood.) It had a nice character to it. A cross between antique Victorian and an old Western movie feel. The man at the desk is the manager and promptly checks me in. He is polite and seems happy to serve his clients and answered any questions I had. I had emailed the hotel about something pre-trip and he'd answered me himself and even remembered my email. All the other staff I encountered were very nice as well. No attitude from anyone. There are no safes in the room so I got a safety deposit box for my passport & video camera(it's just a tiny camcorder so it JUST fit) and then I went to the elevator. It's really small, old and a little slow(not Imperial Palace elevators slow) but with the building being over 100 years old, it's a wonder they even have one. Although it's old, it didn't feel unsafe. The hallway is long for such a small property and the walls are a buttery yellow coloured plaster. Kind of dull but clean and in good repair. There is also an ice machine and pop machine. I don't remember the price but had remarked to myself it was very reasonably priced compared to others that are well over $2. I get to my room and use their interesting key card. Instead of the usual \"credit card\" style, this one is a chunky plastic sort of antique shaped key. One swipe and I open the door and take a look inside. I knew to expect a very small room and that it was but it was very functional. All the furniture in the room was new within the past year and included a leather club chair, modern-retro style floor lamp, large cadenza with a big LG flat screen TV & Hamilton Beach coffee maker, two night tables, two table lamps and Ipod docking station. The curtains, bed, bedding and pillow-top mattress(almost as comfy as the ones at the MGM Signature) were also new, as was the carpet. The only thing not totally redone are the bathrooms and mine was miniscule(but workable). The toiletries were Nutragena and were better than what I've had in some more expensive rooms. Towels were on the thin and rough side but there were plenty. While the bathroom was clean, the tiles on teh floor and walls could do with revamping. Don't quote me but they look like they could be the originals from when the hotel opened in 1906 or not long afterwards. Not sure if all the rooms had bathrooms back then. Some of of the very small tiles that were chipped and there were many grout repairs but again the bathroom did not feel gross or dirty. The counter/taps/toilet looked newer and the shower head was one of those large rainshower ones. It had a long neck that I'm sure would easily accommodate someone quite tall. The closet door was very narrow but when I looked inside I saw that it actually goes really deep so you have lots of room. The airconditioner worked very well and blocked out any noise from the Fremont Street Experience/bands outside (The Guess Who were playing that night. Cool!). The music and stuff ends at midnight. My rooms wasn't facing out towards Fremont but sideways over an alleyway that the employees use for breaks. It's also where they throw out glass beer bottles but again with the A/C on I didn't hear any of the noise. The biggest thing that bothered me with the room is that there is a little lip up from the floor where the bathroom meets the rest of the room and I kept forgetting about it. It wasn't exactly a step so there was no danger of catching your foot and tripping but it was a little bit of a nuisance. Looking closer at the room, I notice that the edges of the carpet where they meet the baseboards are a little dusty. Either the maids were taking shortcuts with the vacuuming or their machine does not allow for close contact against the walls because the rest of the room was spotless and I'm a germaphobe. There are no hairdryers in the rooms but they are available at the front desk. I was able to get one in the evening to use the following morning but I've noticed reviews the past few days that say folks were only able to keep them an hour or so. I didn't experience that but maybe they weren't busy that night even though it was a Saturday with lots going on. If room-service is important, they don't have it here. It's not a big deal to go bring something up from downstairs yourself though is it? I usually stay at the Venetian or Signature but had to do things on a budget this time. For $19.06 I was scared of what I might get and honestly was very pleased. I had absolutely no trouble and would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. It was nice staying at a smaller place and I've paid many times more money for rooms not even half as nice as this in other cities(even though they were much bigger than the ones at Golden Gate).

They did not have anything ready facing Fremont, so I left my belongings with the front desk and went out to wander Fremont Street. When I came back, it was still early and they only had smoking rooms available so far. The head housekeeper told me that since the rooms were newly renovated, I would not smell anything. And she was right. I had room #207 - second floor facing Fremont. It was small, but perfect for one person who wasn't going to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. I liked the way it was decorated, too. There was a small closet, but a large dresser with plenty of room for clothes. The room had a flat-screen TV and a coffee maker (with coffee, cups & etc). There was also a clock radio with an iPod dock. I've read some reviews that say paper-thin walls, but no one complained when I played my music, so they couldn't have been that bad. The front desk has irons and hair dryers available. If the place is busy, they only let you have them for a certain amount of time, but I opted for wet hair and wrinkled clothes anyway. The bathroom is kind of dated, but clean. I'm not a fan of separate hot and cold water knobs, but the old fashioned style added to the ambiance. I never did seem to get the shower water temperature just right, but I didn't get burned, so that's all that counts. I would have like a more comfortable bed, but at $19.06/night we're not talking Wynn quality mattresses. The only thing I didn't like was that, being short, I couldn't get close to the bathroom mirror to apply makeup. I had to use the large mirror on the wall by the bed, but the lighting in the room was kind of dim and not useful for that purpose. So they could use some of those swing-out makeup mirrors or brighter lighting near the mirror. Overall, I liked my stay at the Golden Gate. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.

As long as you have reasonable expectations, you will probably not be disappointed. My wife and I booked a room there for Saturday, April 11th at their promotional rate of $19.06. This, for a Saturday night, was a ridiculous deal. Since they only have 100 or so rooms, check-in was a breeze. We received our room in the \"old\" section of the hotel, which meant that the room was extremely small. That was OK with us. We didn't choose the Golden Gate for the amenities, after all. The room was very clean and looked nice with its art-deco motif. There were framed photos of Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong on the walls, which I thought was cool. It also had a sweet flat-screen TV. The bathroom was, again, small but functional with one exception. As a previous reviewer noted, there was no hot water in the morning. This was, admittedly, frustrating but I was willing to overlook it for the price. A cold shower helped to work me out of my hangover-induced haze anyway. When we asked at the front desk about the water, we were told that since the GG is an old hotel (the oldest in Vegas), the hot water isn't as readily available in the mornings and if you shower in the afternoon, it should be at an acceptable temperature. Rather ridiculous but, again, $19. One other cool thing about our room was that it had windows that opened. And not just a crack - fully open, both windows. That's a rarity in Vegas. All in all, I thought the Golden Gate was a great value. If you're going to gamble at all, I highly recommend signing up for their players club. My wife and I both did and we received $20 and $25 each in free play EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK!!!!! This was incredible news to us, as we had played almost nothing through their machines. We were only downtown for the one night but could have gotten over $300 in free play if we played there every day. This was not well-publicized, however.

We were in Las Vegas to get married that weekend and knew that we would be playing and running around most of the nights with very little sleep and we did not want to spend high dollar to stay on the strip and basically not spend time in our room sleeping so we decided on this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting a whole lot out of that hotel since it is really old and not really fancy. However, our room had two queen beds, a LARGE flat pannel tv, a closet and a bathroom. The room was really small for two beds and we didnt need the second bed but it faced out on the street towards the Plaza and was quiet. We did not get the noise from Fremont at all. The walls are pretty thin so we could hear the neighbors in the morning when they would get up and leave, but that really could have been because they were noisy. It seemed like all they did was go in and out of their room over and over. The bathroom was the only disappointing part of the hotel. It was very old and not updated in the least with broken tile behind the toilet and the shower curtain seemed a little dirty at the bottom. Our toilet ran all night until we figured out that we just needed to lift the lid (which was too large for the toilet) and set the plunger straight. However, the shower water pressure was perfect! The toiletries were a nice touch but the towels were scratchy. We had a coffee maker in our room and cable television which we only used to get ourselves relaxed to sleep at night but both were sufficient. Maid service was respectable to our hours and we did not see them come and go. Check in was miserable. It took the young guy over thirty minutes to work with the couple in front of us simply because he was extremely slow! Our buddy checked in the next morning and he had a young girl that was fast. Our checkout was extremely fast and the older woman was very friendly! We ate in the cafe several times and their food was really good. We had a thirty minute wait on Friday night because we had a large party (8 of us) but the rest of the time it was no longer than 5-10 minutes at the most and if you wanted to sit at the counter then you were served immediately! They had another open cafe right in the casino floor and it was a HUGE dissapointment. I would NOT eat there again and their service was TERRIBLE. They had a line that was about thirty people deep one evening and TWO people working and it took us over an hour to get our food. GRRR The floor waitresses that served the craps table were awesome. Totally on top of the drinks. The pit bosses and dealers were a lot of fun as well. I would totally stay there again. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in other big cities for $450 per night and the service was not any better than the Golden Gate although their rooms were really nice. However, I am only bringing that up to let you know that i DO know my hotels and motels. The Golden Gate has a charm all of it's own and if you are looking for luxury this place is not for you. However, if you look at it for it's historical charm and the fact that you won't sleep that much anyway in Las Vegas then it is a perfect choice! Besides, we got a STEAL at $19 per night. I probably would have paid up to $70 per night there but no higher and only because of the bathroom. It really was a nasty one. They need to do something with those as soon as possible. My cousin stayed across from us at the Las Vegas Club in a double queen for $80 per night. Her room was twice as large but the beds were HORRIBLE. I even jumped on one and could get NO spring out of it because she said they were hard as a rock and she was absolutely right. I do not think i could have slept there even drunk without pain.

I chose the Golden Gate because they offered the cheapest rate in town for that Sunday night, $19.06($21.16 with tax). I requested a double room online and when I checked in I was given room #302 which is right in front on Fremont St, almost on the corner of Main St. I was pleasantly surprised. The decor was beautiful. Have you ever seen a $19 room newly renovated with beautiful dark hardwood furnishings, pillowtop beds, an LCD TV, and clock radio/alarm with an iPod docking station, Neutrogena bath products, coffee maker, etc? Neither have I. All the room needed was a fridge to be in line with many 4 star hotel rooms I've stayed in. Beds: The pillowtop beds were extra comfy with high TC sheets. I'm 5'11\" and 240lbs and they were not too short as another reviewer stated. Other than the noise outside I slept very well. Floor Space: Before I left for Vegas, after what I read here, I told my massage therapist that we would have to wait til the next night at Main Steeet Station for my massage. Wrong. My room had plenty of space for a massage table. In fact, I could have held a cocktail party with 10-12 adults in #302 quite comfortably. There's plenty of room, unlike what has been written here in other reviews. Bathroom: Now here is where we drift off. Most guys wont mind the lack of counter top and shelf space but most females will be highly annoyed. The old fashioned shower worked very well with plenty of water pressure and hot water, almost like an aqua massage. The Neutrogena toiletries were a nice touch too. Plenty of towels furnished in all sizes. Closet: there is a huge walk in closet, very deep with a rack of hangers in the middle. Very strange. I would add to the bathroom space with some of this wasted space. Noise: the room had three windows that open directly onto Fremont Street. This is great unless you actually plan to sleep at some point before 7am. The Fremont Street Experience goes on til midnight, but the drunks stay up til 4am hooting, hollering and screaming. Then about 5am, all the service vehicles start their day; trash trucks, street sweepers and cleaners, delivery trucks, etc. Ear plugs don't help much. It's like being on Bourbon St during Mardi Gras. If you like noise and action, request a room between #301-#310. If not, ask for a quieter room location. Casino: The casino is small with not much to offer. I did enjoy playing Viva Las Vegas video slots with Elvis and Ann Margaret. I won $120 in a bonus round and headed across the street to Las Vegas Club where I was served only too well by beautiful young co ed types. Drink service was dismal at Golden Gate. Also, there's plenty of staff hanging around but they don't seem to do much but block the aisles. Some of my fellow patrons had this down as well. Food: I didn't try any of the cuisine here but the ambiance looked quite nice. Very relaxed with warm hardwood decor. Bottom line: I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or to recommend Golden Gate to others. The benefits far outweigh any downsides. The location is excellent for a downtown trip. Notes: Parking is valet only directly behind the hotel off Main St. Elevator service is adequate and stairs are an option. Lots of memories in those walls but no ghosts. Sorry. I asked a couple of them for comments but they refused.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bismarck, ND", "Title": "\u201cGood stay @ the Golden Gate!\u201d", "Author": "TheElCoKid", "ReviewID": "UR24386296", "Content": "This was my second stay @ the Golden Gate, my first stay having been in November of 2008.

The windows pop open to the outside, which was kind of neat. The mattresses are very comfortable & I slept very well. I was in room 314, above the alley, with Fremont St. to the north. Because of potential noise, I wore earplugs when I slept. I'm glad to say they worked very well, I didn't hear any noise from the alley or other rooms. However, don't stay here if you plan on going to bed before the FSE shows end at midnight, because you'll hear it, earplugs or not. Since I don't got to bed that early, it wasn't an issue for me. The only noise from the alley was an occasional delivery truck, and that was usually in mid-afternoon. Overall, I'd easily stay here again, especially since they give me 5 night comps every quarter!

Some say this place is a dump, others say it is very clean, I found my room to be clean. As advised, I requested a 4th floor room, but was told someone activated the sprinklers a few days earlier so the 2nd floor was closed & were short on rooms. I was given room 306 facing Fremont St. I got a kick out of the view from my room, the windows opened right out to Fremont St., we had a great view of the Thunderdome cage too. Nice if you\u2019re in Vegas to have fun all night, but if you plan to do a lot of sleeping, the Fremont Experience is easily seen and heard in this Hotel. The bathroom was just OK, it could have been better, but seemed to bug the girl I was with more than myself, and the air conditioning couldn't keep up until the mornings. On Friday, they had $3 blackjack, but Saturday, the price went up to $5, at least they added bikini table dancers to compensate. I joined the Player's club to get the 99 cent shrimp cocktail, and was able to milk some free cards, dice and calendar just by asking at signup. I ate twice at the Bay City Diner, the food was good, but the prices were kind of high. I do recommend their signature burger with the knife stabbed through it, and the deep fried spaghetti.

Located at the very top of the Freemont Experience , this quaint little hotel has a lot going for it. Firstly its cheap. The rooms are small, but we found the beds comftable and the rooms clean. We have stayed there a few times. The bathrooms are tiny, with little room to move around in, but for the price, you really cant expect too much. Inside the hotel there are two places to eat. The Shrimp Bar and Deli, located near reception, has a variety of sandwiches, soup and other cafeterria style eats. The real attraction here is the 99c Shrimp Cocktail (only 99c to Club 1906 members, the hotel's Rewards Programme, which is free to join, so go on and do it!) The story behind the Cocktail is that in 1959, the Golden Gate introduced the Shrimp Cocktail and it's been voted Best of Las Vegas for years since! Worth the 99c just to say you've tried it!! The other eatery in the hotel is the Bay City Diner, which is located around the back of the casino. We actually missed it the first time around, but are glad we eventually found it. The meals are HUGE and the prices are really reasonable. The place is one of our favourite places to eat downtown...its not fancy, just good food at reasonable prices (and they are open till really late!) This hotel is great for people who wont spend too much time in their rooms (ie, poker players or any hardcore gambler hahaha). We did experience some loud neighbours on our last visit, the walls dont seem to be very thick, so that was a negative. The other negative is the check -in policy they have. You cant check in till some ridiculous time...I think its 12pm, so if you're plane arrives at 7am, you have to wonder the streets!

The location is just perfect. Close to any other casino or hot spot within the Fremont Downtown experience. The casino itself is wonderful. Great tables to play and at a very low $5 waging. You can't find that. The music and the bar scene are just perfect for those that just want to enjoy a piece of Vegas. If you're into the craziness, then head outside and join the crowds in the boardwalk of Fremont's experience. There's music and plenty of vendors. Back to the Hotel, the rooms are a bit older, but they are well-kept. The elevator is a bit slow, but I always rode it up alone. The bed was comfy and the smell of the room was fine.

People do better on the tables. Cocktail service is not very good if your playing slots. Most waitress stay by the tables. Casino is really small, but some how its takes 15 min to get a drink.

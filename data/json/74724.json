Let me explain the set up there. There is a main wing perpendicular to the road, an outdoor pool and parking, then a short wing parallel to the road creating a T. Though the front clerk seemed like a high school student with no training, the check in was smooth enough. I was checked into the rear wing. It seems to be occupied by long term residence. They were cooking on the upstairs walk way and were talking to each other from many units away from each other. It was a little noisy but I tried to nap about 5pm. I get a knock on the door and it was from someone looking for someone else. I called the front desk and asked for a room in the front wing but is told none were available. I couldn't sleep now so I tried to get on the internet. After repeated failure, I call the front desk and she said, \"Lots of people tell me that but keep trying. Eventually you connect.\" I think its more a case of eventually people give up and stop calling the front desk. So I walk to the front lobby and the w-fi worked there. People are calling for rooms and she is telling them that the rates are double of what I paid. I left for dinner and returned about 11. People were still talking to each other outside. I was tired so I fell asleep okay. I got a phone call at 1 am asking for the same person the afternoon visitor asked for. You could still hear people talking and yelling outside, especially as cars arrived and left the parking area at this time. Then at 5 am, I got a pounding on the door again while calling for the person again. I looked out the window and told the person she had the wrong room. At 730 when I left, that female that was knocking at 5 was still sitting on the stairway in front of the room and asked if I could help her. Final thing, they say Continental Breakfast. They had a dozen bite sized muffins on a lobby counter with no drinks (hot or cold) or water. Bottom line, it was cheap (on a very busy weekend because of spring training) and very convenient to the freeway. I would stay there again if I was by myself and could specifically stay for the front wing. I would not bring my family there under any circumstance.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFound Earing In My Bed...\u201d", "Author": "BusinessCO", "ReviewID": "UR119257906", "Content": "This place is disgusting.

I walked out. Im in the process of trying to get a refund and management is giving me the runaround. I think i am going on my 5th phone call... Do not stay here.

My wife and I could not get out fast enough. The neighborhood has changed and we did not feel safe. No bathroom sink, NO stopper for the two bay kitchen sink in the room(WHY?), NO remote in the room, NO clock/radio, NO shampoo. Using sandpaper would have been softer than the paper thin towels(?). Checking in to a person behind a glass enclosure was our first clue that we should have picked a different motel. Had it not been for the late hour, we would have left. It has left a very bad taste in my mouth for any Travel Inn. I doubt that I would ever pick that chain for a nights stay.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flagstaff,AZ", "Title": "\u201cNice Place To Stop\u201d", "Author": "guy-frassygirl", "ReviewID": "UR48432094", "Content": "I found that the Travel Inn that we stayed in was a nice place for us to stay at while visiting some friends. The roon was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The place was well centralized and the neighborhood was fairly quiet, considering the size of Phoenix as well as the location. The pool was clean and our swim was most pleasant. My only complaint was that the bed was a bit hard. The room was priced within our budget and I would say that we got what we paid for.

Its usually used for stop-overs. I landed in Phoenix airport to start my 3 month stay to practice my golf. I called the hotel and booked a 1 night stay, as it was late at night and i needed a sleep. A guy resembling santa claus turned up in a silver bus and picked us up. WELCOME TO HELL!!! We arrived at the travel inn and paid, unfortunately we didnt know this place was so bad befor we paid. After paying, we asked the receptionist were we could go for a pizza at midnight, and she said ''its not advisable going outsde with your wallet, cell phone or your watch around here, you will get shot''. We took that advice...thankfully. That night, there was a prostitute walking the balconys looking for business, a gangster party next door - prostitutes also there..drug dealers all over the place..wow...that place is a joke. dont go near it.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt's has to be worst than a \"crack\" hotel!\u201d", "Author": "MamamiaFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR7390044", "Content": "I hope that something is done to get this horrible hotel off the Internet.

We will never go there again and we want anyone who is considering it as a choice for a hotel, to forget about it.Travelocity, should be made aware of this dirt Pit. P.S.

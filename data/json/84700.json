Cypress Cove. We\u2019ve really enjoyed the nude beach experience, but visiting Cypress Cove has added a whole new perspective to our relatively new naturalist endeavors. We went on a Sunday and arrived late morning. A bit apprehensive, the apprehension began to shed off as early as the front gate. We would readily shed our closes about a half hour later. The lady at the gate was very pleasant and friendly. She was very welcoming and without her knowing she was making us feel special and comfortable from the very beginning. The office was busy with people checking out but it gave us an opportunity to watch the way the staff interacted with the people waiting to be helped. I told my wife that for the first time I felt a little self-conscious wearing cloths and she felt the same way. Once we signed in at the office another very friendly and inviting lady took us on a brief and informative tour. Again we felt self-conscious being clothed and wondering around the pools and other various places in the resort. We both got a kiss from a very nice lady at the salon\u2026 chocolate kiss, that is, as we joked about having my hair done (buffed). Well, I could go on and on about how at home we felt. We took out a paddle boat around the lake. We sat by one of the pools and had our lunch. We spent time lying around and walking around, all in the buff. I\u2019d like to fish next time. Others were fishing. I\u2019m sure that this resort is not like other extravagant and expensive resorts. It doesn\u2019t have the \u201cpolished brass\u201d look, but is clean and inviting. It was surreal to be nude all day. It was relaxing and enjoyable to experience the freedom of nudism. But, from our perspective what we enjoyed the most about Cypress Cove on our day visit, were friendly people. The people on staff and the patrons were the best asset that this resort has.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo", "Title": "\u201cYet another fabulous stay at Cypress Cove\u201d", "Author": "Kalamadrew", "ReviewID": "UR127073484", "Content": "I fear that people will get bored by my several reviews of Cypress Cove. In short, as far as we are concerned, The Cove is so great we won't even look for another resort in FL. It's easy to get to, has a million things going on each day, has great staff, and they bend over backwards to be helpful and take care of your needs. This time we stayed for 10 days. The weather was fantastic with rain only part of one day and sunny 80's the rest of the time. We played Petanque every day in the afternoon and walked the perimeter several times during our stay. Mostly we relaxed and let the tension of our work leave us and the relaxation wash over us. (we call it letting the air out of the balloon.) We went to another great show by the Cove Players. We found out they put over 100 hours of practice into this years program. The show with a never ending hot and cold buffet is only $24 per person including tip. There are too many details to list that delighted us again this time.

Helpful and welcoming staff, good solid American food at reasonable prices, and the clothing optional experience is perfect, with a very large community pool, and a smaller, quiet pool, for those who simply want to get some deep rest. there is a good range of spa services, and a shop for the few things you need that you might have forgotten. Finally, for those who enjoy the social part of nudity, there are lots of activities, and plenty of people who will give you space, but, also, engage in conversation. We did not enjoy staying in the hotel, the one time we stayed there, because it was dated, and that is why I debated giving a four or five star rating. In all fairness, the buildings are older, and require an extra measure of TLC, as one would expect. There is an on-going attempt to keep the facility up-to-date, and, when all is said, they really do try, with room for improvement. We have found that there is a better alternative, which is to bring a tent for camping. The campsite is right on the edge of the lake, with a full 180 degree view of the water. The lake, especially in the morning as the sun comes up, is pure, beautiful, old Florida; the camp ground shaded, well-maintained, and insect-free. And, since the entire grounds is clothing free, where else can you camp in the buff, on the bluff? That experience is so wonderful, being natural, out in nature. It would quickly make a convert of anyone who has the slightest willingness to truly enjoy the freedom such an experience brings? Cypress Cove, is the place to do it!

We were there this year (February) for \"Parrot Head Lite\" the winter version of their huge celebration in July. The party was a bit more subdued this year, but I think it was due mostly to the weather. It was warm (80) but overcast, so I am guessing that some folks stayed away thinking it would rain. Music at the pool Saturday afternoon and fellow party goers handing out jello shots made for a fun afternoon! We love the relaxed and friendly atmosphere of this place! The \"regulars\" and snowbirds that are there make visitors feel like part of the family. Our only complaint would be that while the weekend crowd was more diverse in age, the clientele is older, so there is not much for night life (with Parrot Head Lite weekend, we did hang out and dance at the poolside bar til after 11pm to some DJ music which was fun). Cypress does not have an \"official\" night club like Caliente or Paradise Lakes and they work hard to maintain a family friendly/AANR friendly resort. The upside is that Cypress is fine with guests bringing in their own coolers for drinks and snacks around the pool (Something that Caliente and Paradise don't allow) and they have a poolside bar/restaurant with great food too. The rooms are clean, but basic. The restaurant has great food and we ate all of our meals there for the weekend, so had a sampling of breakfast/lunch and dinner options.

I am getting used to this lifestyle of being nude anywhere you go but it has taken me a bit longer than others to remove my clothing and be natural. No one seems to care what anyone looks like and everyone is nude (it is a rule to have no clothing on in the gated area that surrounds the pools, hot tubs). It was a bit of an \"older\" I hesitate to use this title as we are all doing just that with every day that passes but we were a bit disapointed that it was mainly an older crowd. If I had to guess I woulld say that mainly the average age was 60+ although they were friendly and social group of folks. Seemed as though there were alot of people who had been coming there for a long time and knew eachother pretty well so it was a little uncomfortable being the somewhat of the \"outsider group\" of guests as we knew no one and we were traveling alone as a couple together. We stayed in the hotel type room which only had a small refridge so it made meal planing a bit difficult since we normally have done all inclusive places and dont always want to get dressed to go out to eat outside of the property. Food & beverages were available on site however. As for the property: It was very well maintained and had a beautiful lake with canoes and paddle boats, camping area for tenters near by the lakeside, 2 pools, an outdoor and an indoor hot tub area, 2 bars and a very nice restaurant on the property. They also had a clothing boutique (odd for a nudist resort) but nice souvenier type stuff, spa & fitness center as well. We did not use the spa or fitness center but they looked very nice if you are interested in doing those things. Very nice place overall, we met a few nice couples who we chatted with after the first day, we were there for 3 nights. The Halloween dinner dance party and costume contest was very nice. We dressed up and had a nice time, food was very good at the restaurant for the buffet & party.

Two and a half years ago Tammy (the owner of the franchise) was going away for a weekend (We thought it would be nice to spend a few extra dollars) and we were excited about being at Cypress Cove so we purchased six massages for the price of five, using four of the six on that vacation.

The only issue we had this trip was with the volleyball tourney which brought in quite a few young 'non-naturist/nudist' guests. One night my wife walked to the campsite bathroom in the middle of the night nude and felt very uncomfortable when a group of these college aged male guests saw her and made not so polite comments to themselves. Waking up to see that little alligator just hanging out offshore of our campsite was pretty cool! :) We hung out by the pool as usual and had a great time. The resort allows everyone to bring coolers to the pool which is awesome, but we did use the bar a lot as well. The food is great at the restaurant and grill. My wife is a sun worshiper so she loves working on erasing her tan lines away. Everyone we met was friendly as was the staff. Chatting it up with other guests at the hot tubs is always fun.

The two swimming pools (one shallower, one deeper) were crystal-clear and all of the areas were impeccably clean.

There is a major supermarket within 2 miles, a small convenience store with limited offerings at the resort, and a 7-11 store with gas station across the road. There are a number of fast-food and sit-down retaurants close by. The location is somewhat remote from the major Orlando attractions (about 15-20 miles) but the roads are excellent. We found that a GPS unit was very helpful. All in all, this is the nicest naturist facility we have ever visited, but during the 5 weekdays we were there the (nude) recreation areas were almost exclusively attended by seniors.

The food was very good and very reasonably priced at both. As is the case at all nudist resorts the atmosphere is casual and the people are very friendly. However, like all nudist resorts the majority of people are locals or frequent weekend visitors that all know each other so you will experience the continual reminder that \"you are from out of town\" vibe. Another good thing is unlike a few resorts there is no \"swinger\" element at Cypress Cove. It is frowned upon and discouraged. So if \"mixing it up\" is your thing, this ain't the place.

For example, we joked about not even being able to hold hands (PDA) near the pool area, based upon some previous reviews. We are fairly open-minded and have visited some strictly adult and pretty wild sites, and are live and let live unless people are pushy or arrogant. On the other hand, we're not real keen on lots of noisy kids running around. Cypress Cove tended to be a nice balance. Mostly a middle-aged, married crowd, no obvious swingers. Very scenic, reasonably priced, friendly staff (very important to us), and a nice Saturday night dance atmosphere (also high on our list of desires) in the bar & grill area. No swinging or wildly sexy attire, but reasonably sexy and intimate, like an average dance bar where the people would be clothed. We enjoy a good dance atmosphere, so that was a big plus for us. Most of the crowd was middle aged and friendly. There were a couple of younger (20 something) couples also. Not too prudish, not too lewd. Nice breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the lake.

The average age is very high in this resort though, I bet you it was close to 70 if not above. Part of this is simply Florida, part is indeed the whole idea of naturism I was told. I dare to say that naturism is much more something of all ages in Europe. The fact that also the restaurant was fully in the bare (by choice of most, was not compulsary) was a bit too much for me. People were friendly allright, but again compared to Europe I believe it is easier to connect in France, Croatia, Spain but also Jamaica or Mexico for that matter with fellow guests than it was in this resort. Could be the age difference too... The lake was beautiful, loved to see the small aligators swimming so close by. The rooms and everything else was old and outdated, and could use a great deal of investment to beef it up compared to non-US (France, Spain, Croatia, Jamaica, Mexico) standards I have grown accustomed to. Certainly at the USD 146 per night I paid for a room they should be able to reserve some money for upgrading. The place was nicely occupied, which was partly due to Spring brake of course.

Been a full member since '07. In the past, the highlight of my stay at \"The Cove\" has been the enjoyment of laying in a chase lounge by the pool and enjoying a good cigar while reading a book. Now, according to the signs, \"NO CIGARS PLEASE\", cigars are prohibited. What happened? Did one person complain? Is cigar smoke more offensive than cigarette smoke? Seems to me there could be one small designated area for cigar smoking somewhere in the pool area where no one would be OFFENDED by cigar smoke. Further, wife and I went out of our room, to the pool at 9:45am on Sat, 3/19. We were just lucky enough to find the last available table/chairs under the pavilion between the two pools. With the good weather what it was, I expected a big crowd. However, of all the lounge chairs / tables that were \"staked out\", there were very few people actually there by the pool. One must assume that people come out early in the morning, stake out some land by the pool and then go back to bed and show up later on at their leisure. I don't think this is right. In my opinion, if you are going to claim a spot, you should be in it or in the pool or Cheeks, etc, not back at your camper/ hotel room, etc. (I would write the following in the block below but you don't give me enough space) - I am 62 y.o. and hve been a practicing social nudist since 1973. With every passing year, the average age of the general membership at nudist clubs/resorts appears to get older. I know this is a topic of discussion among the AANR. Not too many years ago, Cypress Cove built the covered childrens play area with things for kids to play on, etc. This was a good idea and an attempt to attract yoiunger families I am sure. Why not a kiddie pool?? Kids at the pool want to go in the pool, not climb the jungle jim when its 90+ degrees out.

We arrived on a Sunday and only planned to stay for the day. This was our first exerience at a clothing optional resort so we were a little apprehensive but excited at the same time. The main entrance is located across the street from \"Lowes\" , I mention that because it would have helped us immensely driving down the street looking for the gate. The front gate guard was very friendly and asked for drivers licences & licence plate number. I did not think it unusual and it didn't take long to be on our way inside. We stopped at the front desk and the lady was very helpful signing us in(just a couple small items to read over and sign). After that she took us on a nice tour of the facility and wished us a nice day. I was thinking something was missing and remembered we had not paid yet for our day, so I pulled out my credit card and she said not to worry that our first visit was free. this immediately got us started on a happy note and i thanked her and promised to enjoy some food in their restaurant. we had read many reviews about cypress on here and decided to follow the advice of other trip advisor people to start our day by the lake. The lake is BEAUTIFUL! It wasn't long and we were au natural enjoying a beuatiful Florida day. The whole feeling by the lake was peaceful, there were only one or two other poepl and most were reading. One man, did spend some time staring at my wife but I kind of like that so it didn't bother me(or her, lol)i assumed he was a single male in search of fun, but he did not approach us or say anything rude. The paddle boats looked fun but we were told there were alligators in the lake so we passed(maybe next time we won't be so chicken. I personally WOULD NOT recommend swimming in the lake after having lived in Florida for several years, alligators can strike without warning. Anyways, we strolled over the the cafe by the pool(cheeks) and had an awesome lunch. No complaints. There other rstaurant by the lake was closed but the food we ate was wonderful. We were anxious to try out the pools so we headed to the one closest us(the smaller one). Seemed to be a local crowd but no one was unkind. Maybe a few looks, but nothing bad. The atmosphere was very relaxed, again, with many people reading. We enjoyed ourselves, truthfully we wanted to cuddle more(no not sex, just cuddle) but we had read where other trip advisor members had been chastised for being too cozy so we refrained, still enjoyed the pool immensely. We followed that with a dip in the hot tub(huge) and had it all to ourselves(daytime). We then went to the much larger pool and loved it even more. It had a nice waterfall flowing inot the pool and the crown seemed a little more active and playful. Just a note, the majoiryt of the crowd seemed to be in the 50-60 range(we are in our 30's) but we did see about 4-5 couples inour age group and had a very nice chat with one, no pressure, just good conversation. We hopped out and tried the other jacuzzi near this pool, a little smaller but loved the feel of a breeze while sitting in it. Again, we had it all to ourselves. Then we took another stroll by the lake, toured the game room(wonderful photos on the wall) and relaxed a bit before one final dip in the pool. The pool with the waterfall was by far our favorite. Although we are not 100% sure it did feel at times we were being watched by one our two regulars to make sure we did not engage in any sexual activities. While i understand their desire to keep the club NUDIST and not SWINGER my wife and I enjoy light cuddling and had to hold back a bit out of respect i guess. All in all we had a very nice RELAXING time and will definitely be back. If you're a first time couple i think you will like this place a lot, if you get excited though you may have to care for each other in your room(we just stayed for the day so we can't comment. ) My wife and i joked about the older crowd just being a bit jealous since us youngsters didn't have to buy little blue pills just yet, lol. all in all a great day!", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heath, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat first time experience!!\u201d", "Author": "mkr2327", "ReviewID": "UR81589579", "Content": "This was our first experience at a clothing optional resort.

The Cove features beautiful, well-manicured grounds and has, in recent years, upgraded its weekend activities. The atmosphere is still more sedate than its ultra-upscale Tampa competitors, but depending on one's tastes that's not a bad thing. The Cypress Cove staff is mostly pleasant and helpful, though on a few occasions I've received decidedly perfunctory replies to inquiries. The fitness center is well-equipped and, for an additional fee, provides a nice change from sunbathing, soaking, and other indolent activities. I concur with the highly positive reviews posted here, so instead I would like to address two areas of criticism submitted by others: the resort's singles policy and unfriendliness of residents. I've stayed at the Cove both with my wife and now as a widower. I can't speak for management, but my impression is that Cypress Cove, like most nudist resorts and camps, considers the admittance of any particular single male to be a judgment call, especially if the visitor is not a member of the AANR or Naturist Society. The Cove has always been family/couples oriented, period. True, the resort sponsors \"Singles Weekends,\" but I suspect one goal is to encourage male and female guests to later return with a partner. A pleasant, friendly demeanor when arranging for a visit can go a long way toward creating a favorable impression. If you're an unfamiliar single male, just showing up at the gate is never a good idea. The folks who live all or part of the year at Cypress Cove tend to be cliquish, and some are resentful of vacationers and weekend visitors. They seem to forget without that source of income the resort would be hard-pressed to to provide the first-class facility they enjoy. Whether a single person or a couple, being friendly (but not pushy) and helpful (should the opportunity arise), can make striking up a conversation much easier.

Over the years i have introduced many friends and family members to the resort (first-timers), and all have expressed interest in coming back again and again. Cypress Cove is in a league if its own.

Tennis, Lake with canoes, Bocci Ball, Vollyball courts all available, the fitness facility has been an extra charge in the past. Two great swimming pools and a bar restaurant area and the usual nudist hot tubs. Excellent restaurant with nice dance floor and good music once or twice a week. And in the past there has been a morning fitness group a couple time a week. The staff, the permanent residents, and the day use members are appropriately friendly, helpful, we always feel comfortable and secure.

If you are a new nudist couple I would recommend this resort. If you are a new nudist single male I would suggest maybe somewhere else. If you are going to specifically meet other nudist couples or singles I wouldn't recommend it. Seasoned true nudists are suspicious of new people whether couples or singles.

The weather was OK - not great - but I got plenty of time in the sun. I arrived on the 18th and drove immediately to Cypress Cove in Kissimmee. It's about a 45 minute drive from Orlando Airport. I immediately felt welcome by the gate guard and the front desk staff. I checked in to a really nice hotel style room. It was a large room and had a table, couch, fridge, TV, coffee maker and a small TV I never used. There was high speed wireless with great connectivity and the room was 40 yards from one of the pools and hot tubs. As soon as I unpacked I hit one of the outdoor showers and the hot tub. I met a really nice permanent resident of the resort and we had a great chat. I felt welcome and included. One of my fears, as a single male, is that I would be ignored or worse but that never happened. Everyone was great the entire time. The next day I went to the pool area early, had a soak in the tub and stretched out on a chaise. People come over early to stake out their chairs for the day. They'll leave for a while but they come back and spend the rest of the day. I spent the day relaxing and reading. I spoke to the people next to me on both sides and they were great. For lunch I went to the bar between the pools. I had several meals there. The food was great, the prices reasonable, and the service fantastic. On Friday night I made reservations for the musical show in the restaurant. I went over nude but took a tee shirt \"just in case\" It became apparent that most people were coming in clothed so I put the shirt on. Ultimately only about 4 people stayed nude for the show. The show was really well done by the local \"Players\" and was a lip synching reprise of 50's-80's music. It was well done and everyone had a good time. The buffet was outstanding - fresh seafood, carved beef, desserts. Total price for the buffet and the show was $24. Overall - my stay at Cypress was simply outstanding and I'll be back. I'd recommend it to everyone. It's easy to get to, the people are great, the facilities are good to excellent, the lodging and food prices are comparable to a textile resort. The weather could have been a few degrees warmer but that's no fault of the resort.

The facilities are a little old but well maintained. There are three \"sections\" -- permanent residences (all mobile homes that have been made permanent with underpinnings and garages), a campground, and a resort consisting of four or five buildings. We stayed in the resort. One big plus is that it is only about 30 minutes from the Orlando airport. There are some nice recreation facilities. A couple of nice pools, one much larger than the other. The large pool is more crowded and fairly loud. The other pool is smaller but quieter, has a deep end and better for lap swimming. The large lake has free paddleboats. We just untied one and paddled around one morning. Nice tennis courts, surprising large fitness room, and a game room. (My first game of naked ping pong). Can also rent golf carts and bicycles. We rented 2 bicycles and rode throughout the complex. (Wish they had bicycle for two). Our room was 1162, a Villa Parlor Room in Villa 4. Dated but very clean. (Use the old plastic diamond-shaped door key holders that I haven't seen in years.) Refrigerator and coffee pot but no microwave. Also, there is NO ice machine on the premises. You must buy a big bag of ice from the office store ($1.50) but it will fit in the freezer part of the refrigerator just fine. Next to our room was a Villa apartment. The two units could be joined via connecting interior doors. Problem was that the doors were not close to being sound resistant. We could hear almost everything being said (or done!) in the apartment next to us. At times, it was almost as if they were in the room with us. Then there was the \"rules\" thing. There are members who patrol the resort, enforcing the rules. They reminded me of hall monitors in school. I thought they were a bit over the top. The pool is supposed to be all nude. A girl had got a bit too much sun, so she had a shirt on. One of the \"guards\" told her she had to be completely nude to be in the pool. What is the point of that rule? My girlfriend and I were hugging a bit in the smaller pool (that was all) and we got fussed at by one of the \"guards.\" Told that this was a \"family resort\" and that they disapproved of such displays of affection.

They all greeted, said hello, have a good day, etc. That was a refreshing touch in a time when most people won't even look at you. The food in the Lochwood Restaurant was good.

I haven't been staying here as much as in the past with a couple other hilton properties in the area (The Wit and the Hilton Garden inn), but still enjoy my stays here and stayed there the weekend of 3/9 for a weekend getaway. Hotel location is perfect. The Red and Orange lines are right outside the door and if you are using OHare, the Blue line takes only a couple minutes to walk to. Lots of stores and place to eat at that are a close walk and very convenient to most theaters in the loop. Fitness center is the best of any hotel I have stayed at. As much variety of machines as most gyms and very clean and modern. One thing I use to hate about this hotel was no wifi except in the lounge. They now have wifi in the rooms and it worked without any problems and was pretty fast. I like that the free code they give you works on more than one device so I was able to use both my phone and IPAD with it. This was my first time staying there since Hilton Honors added suite upgrades to the benefits for diamond members. I had read reviews about some properties not honoring this benefit. Fortunately the Palmer House did and gave me a very nice suite upgrade to suite 11-150. Suite was large and quiet. I used the luggage storage service after checkout and the guys working when I retrieved my bags were great. I didn't think I would have enough time to get to the airport on the blue line seeing I was checking bags and was going to grab a cab and they assured me I had plenty time. They were right and saved me a lot on a cab, and the train ended up being faster than a cab would have been with the traffic backups at a couple spots. The only thing I dont like about this property is how crowded the lounge always is at breakfast time. I usually just take the tray from under the icebucket up with me to the lounge and put breakfast food on it and go back to my room to eat. That can be a pain though if your room isn't in the elevator bank serving the 23rd floor and having to switch elevators. Other times it isn't difficiult to find a seat and it nice they are open most of the day for things like grabbing a soda or bottled water. During breakfast time though they REALLY need to enforce the T&C of the HHonors program of only the member and ONE guest being allowed access if they aren't on the executive floor to help keep congestion down.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice ceiling in the lobby, but food trash in room\u201d", "Author": "Dixie C", "ReviewID": "UR126398853", "Content": "I checked in with my daughter on March 16.

The makeup mirror was mounted five feet high -- no use to anyone of my smaller stature. The staff on the Executive level were a tad too pushy in their effort to get us to stop breakfasting at 10 a.m. The elevators are impossible -- I had to go from 10th floor to 7th to get to 25th in order to reach Exec Floor amenities to which my HHonors status entitled me. And the concierge never did pick up that phone, despite 4-5 attempts at calling for info. But on the other hand, the staff are cheerful and will make good on mistakes when they happen. The towels are plush and plentiful. The beds are Hilton-amazing. The price at $174 tax included was acceptable. The location is IDEAL for downtown sightseeing -- a 2 minute walk to the symphony, 10 min. to the Art Institute, 20 min. to Union Station.

I prefer not to be close to the restaurant entrance. The restaurant was virtually empty. I got a grumpy face and a surly 'what entrance?' I also like a light breakfast so on two occasions I ordered eggs and toast from the sides menu, plus coffee and juice. On each occasion I got aggressive 'you want bacon with that?' no. 'you want potatoes with that?' no. And then both questions repeated. On two different days. Are they on commission if they sell bacon and potatoes or did they just want a bigger tip on percentage terms? Who knows. But the impression was one of aggression and made for a tense atmospherere. No one wants to do tense for breakfast. Also, as a restaurant principally designed for dinner and perhaps lunch, it was a very dark space.

Those are probably reserved for Hilton Rewards members and those paying top dollar, which I guess I can understand on a night the hotel is booked, but I don't believe it was the 2 nights we were there. Our room on the 12th floor had a glorious view of a brick wall. But at least we didn't have any street noise or noise from the train other reviewers have complained about. Although the room was a reasonable size, had a flat screen TV, updated decor and had a walk in closest (never had I seen this before in a hotel), the bathroom was so tiny. Like uncomfortably tiny where you are bumping into the toilet while trying to brush your teeth, etc. Not to mention, since this hotel is old there were issues with the water pressure and the hot water remaining a consistent temperature while you were in the shower. These are not issues I would have expected to have to deal with from a 4 star hotel. There was no minibar in our room or coffee maker, but since there was a Starbucks downstairs I would have gone down there anyway.

They were not that forthcoming at check-in about the location of the self-park garage (even though it ended up being right across the street) because they were pushing you to valet. I would strongly suggest to anyone that they bite the bullet and just self-park to save yourself some money, because it was not a hassle at all.

It is well run, has fine furnishings, and has a general feeling of quality. The Palmer House is a reliable choice. I have never had a really bad experience there. Additionally, it is centrally located in the vibrant Chicago downtown. Access is good as several main rail lines have stations within a block or so. You can get to it from O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare airport (Blue Line) or Midway airport (Orange Line) without changing trains. The Palmer House is a very popular hotel for big conferences. I have stayed there probably 10 or so times over the past 35 years and every time it was for a conference I was attending. If you stay there, chances are there will be a major conference going on. Not necessarily bad but something to keep in mind. The hotel elevators are a problem at times especially during meeting change times at conferences. Even if you are not part of the conference, you will still be affected. Five to ten minute waits for elevators are not terribly uncommon. The Palmer House does have many stairways and stairwells spread throughout the building. Unlike many hotels, most of the stairwells open onto all floors and there are signs on the doors that tell which floors they access. Thus, it is very easy to use the stairs to go from floor to floor and, if you are only changing several floors, the stairs are often a good option. However, sometimes stair doors open into unusual places. During my last visit, twice I came off of the stairs right into a meeting room. The guest room elevators are divided into three banks: floor 12 and lower, floors 13-17, and floor 18 and higher. You can decrease the impact of the elevator problems by asking for a room on floors 13-17. Then, when you are going up, take whichever elevator comes first. If it is not the right bank, get off at 12 or 18 and then take the stairs to your floor. There are also escalators that cover the four or five lowest floors. They are usually a much better choice than the elevator. Or, use a combination of the escalators and stairs. The hotel layout is confusing and is much like being in a multi-floor maze, especially the meeting room floors up to floor seven. It is really easy to get confused. Fortunately, the hotel has excellent signage and you can easily find most rooms, whether meeting room or guest room, simply by following the signs. There appears to be no standard guest room layout in the Palmer House and you will see a variety of room arrangements. I think all of the rooms are reasonably well furnished. If you do not like your room for some reason, ask to move. The front desk seems to make every effort to accommodate such requests. A colleague ended up in a room with loud banging, evidently from pipes banging in the steam heating system. A room change request was cheerfully provided. My room was very nice and reasonably spacious. However, the bathroom, while nicely furnished, was extremely small. There was just barely room to get inside the bathroom and close the door, and I am not particularly large. I heard other guests make the same complaint. Not a problem for me but it would have been impossible for two people to be in the bathroom at the same time. Many of the meeting rooms have wifi access. However, I found it almost useless much of the time as it was terribly slow. The wifi in my guest room was pretty good and only occasionally bogged down. The front desk was efficient and the staff was friendly and helpful, as was all staff throughout the hotel. Pricewise, the Palmer House is no bargain but what do you expect for downtown Chicago?

The Palmer House sounded nostalgic and elegant. We looked forward to this \"reward\" stay through the Hilton honors program as my husband achieved Diamond status this year from frequent travel. We looked forward to the perk of the executive lounge and the on-site Balance Spa. Upon arrival, we pulled into the self-park (entrance located on Wabash) under the hotel and were directed to a spot...but then the attendant disappeared. The signage to the hotel elevator/entrance was not very good in the structure. It seemed a little confusing. Next, at the check-in desk, the staff was business-like but no warm greetings or smiles. Anticipating a room upgrade, we were slightly disappointed in our 1st room on the 15th floor. Although told it was recently renovated, the ceilings in the hallway were noticeably low and the room was TINY. When my husband, who is on the taller side, asked for a different room, we were given a corner room on the 9th floor (Wabash St. side of the building). Let me say the room was beautiful and huge BUT it was right next to the train...which was downright loud when you are only a few stories away. Since our key would not work for the lounge access (they must have forgot), we had to go back to the check-in anyway..so I mentioned the loud train, and asked if there was any rooms available on the executive level. There were. I cannot help but wonder why we were not given the Diamond upgrade immediately when the hotel was not full capacity? Does Diamond status mean anything? Shouldn't Hilton brand loyalty be recognized? Anyway, the executive lounge added a little pampering to our weekend and we enjoyed the snacks. In fact, the only staff of Palmer House that seemed at all happy were there (excluding the bartender). Don't waste any $ on specialty drinks as they were very poor quality, very little alcohol and VERY expensive...stick with wine/beer. We found a very nice place on Wabash St. steps from the hotel called Miller's Pub that had Guinness on tap. Overall, the Palmer House delivered on atmosphere. The regal foyer was beautiful and the historic photographs and trivia in different places I found very interesting. I loved the Thomas Roth toiletries and the spa treatments were awesome. ( I had a massage and pedicure.) The fitness center was huge and well equipped but the pool area was disappointing. It seemed smaller than the photo and the hot tub looked ancient and had a ring around the water-line. Not very impressive for such a high-end hotel.

The rooms, however, are way below what one would expect from a standard business hotel of modest price. For instance, there were bedside tables on each side of the bed, but a lamp on only one side (so if two people were in the room, and the one by the lamp wanted to go to sleep earlier, the other would have to get into bed in the dark). THe desk chair could not be adjusted regarding height. There was not enough lighting in the room (partly because of what might have been high efficiency bulbs, but some gave off that harsh, greyish light). The closet was small and the door would not stay open and the ironing board hanging on the door kept banging everytime one moved the door.

Our stay started off very rocky. We called ahead to make arrangements for the room because we were going to arrive very late (after 11:00 pm) with three small children (7, 5 & 1). We spoke with a woman at the front desk and asked that we have a pack n play or crib ready in the room. I was told \"no problem\". I also asked if they had down pillows or comforters. I was told that yes they did. I asked if one of the beds have the down removed. She replied \"Would you like us to make the entire room down-free? That would be no problem.\" I told her that would be wonderful. Upon our arrival at about 11:10 I asked the man working the front desk if they had prepared the room for us with a crib and removal of the down comforters and pillows. He said that they had not, but did see that the request was noted on our reservation. He said they'd have someone up right away. We went to our room and did our best to settle in given that we could not put our baby in a crib. We removed the down pillows and comforterfrom one bed and put them in a pile while we waited for housekeeping to arrive. After 20 minutes I attempted to call the front desk from the phone located between the beds. The front desk answered and I asked for a status update on the cribs and pillows. I received no answer and the front desk hung up. About 10 seconds later, I received a call from the front desk asking if I had received the materials I requested. I stated that I had not, but then the man at the front desk hung up. It became apparent to me that they could not hear me and that the phone receiver must be broken. They called back right away and I answered the phone on the desk (thankfully they had two phones). The man at the front desk seemed shocked that they had not yet delivered the crib and pillows and said that they would be up right away. I also informed him that the phone between the beds was apparently not working. (The defective phone was not replaced during our stay). 15 minutes later we received a knock on the door. They had brought the crib, but no pillows. We informed housekeeping that we had also asked for a down-free room. They left and came back about five minutes later with the pillows. So, we got off to a rocky start to say the least. (Note: a previous review stated that the Palmer House charged extra for a crib. That was not the case for our stay as the crib was free). The room itself was ok. Not very big, but that's to be expected in downtown Chicago. It seemed a bit dated with a tube TV. The heating/cooling was not the best. We had to turn the thermostat down to the coldest setting possible just so we didn't burn up. We also cracked the window to cool it down a bit. (It was 29 degrees outside). The lobby was BEAUTIFUL! There were many people just lounging around having drinks and taking in the beauty of the place. The location was GREAT! It was just across from Milennium Park. There was a Starbucks, Corner Bakery, McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts all right there for breakfast. We were also very close to the El, which was great for hitching a ride to the north end of the Magnificent Mile, but it was quite loud. The Concierge was helpful providing directions and a map of downtown. Unfortunately, the Palmer House charged an arm and a leg for internet and offered wired only in the room. Too bad iPad/iPhone users. I utilized the 3G on my cell phone instead. Not sure why these older hotels don't get with the times. Strange that your cheaper hotels include internet for free. I guess if you're willing to pay for an expensive hotel, you don't mind the extra for internet (and parking for that matter, which was not cheap). On day two we checked out the swimming pool. It was a decent size and had both a shallow and deep end. Unfortunately, someone had detached the safety rope dividing these two sections making it too easy to meander to the sloped part of the pool on the way to the deep end. Not the safest thing for kids. The water was warm enough. They seemed to have a bit of a drainage problem on the pool deck as there was a LOT of standing water that was very cold. They had plenty of towels for guests to use and a number of chairs and tables. We didn't try the restaurant and opted instead for delivery from Giordano's Pizza.

I got the hotel via Priceline and was initially disappointed I got the Palmer House. It has been about 25 since I last stayed there and it was great then as it is now. I was hoping for a hotel closer to the Magnificent Mile rather than the Loop. We were pleasantly surprised with our location. Within blocks of our two plays and the girls liked the area for shopping. As for the hotel, it was as grand as ever and was pleasantly surprised with the level of service which can be rather aloof or stuffy. Not so here. We were checked in by GeRae, who couldn't be more pleasant. Although we had a very good Priceline rate, he didn't make us feel like 'sub-guests'. We paid an extra $49/night for the executive level, more to ensure a larger room than for anything else. The room had two beds (doubles, not queen) and a sitting area and two bathrooms (much appreciated by me and the three ladies). Also included was a good breakfast buffet (fruit, yogurt, cereal, breads and scones, oatmeal, etc.). The only complaint here was that it was too crowded. Finding an empty table was a chore and it closed at 10:00 even though the place was full. A real bright spot at breakfast was Ernest. He was always in a terrific mood and made it a point to learn all of our names. He couldn't have worked harder - a real joy to be around and a real asset to the hotel. Bar prices were high as you would expect at this hotel - one example: four drinks=$60 with a good tip. Didn't have meals there. Check-out was uneventful and efficient. I had HiltonHonors cards and inquired if they were still valid. The gentleman at the desk merely said it didn't matter since no credit would be honored for a Priceline reservation. I just wanted him to check if they were valid and didn't really care about points earned for this stay but decided not to pursue it. That did make me feel a bit like a 'sub-guest' but no big deal. All in all, I would heartily recommend the hotel. Ask for a larger room, exec level if possible.

There is one upscale restaurant (kids didn't like what they served) and a bar with limited selections. We ate at the bar, food so just so so a bit greasy and fries tasted a bit old.

The Palmer House is a really incredible property in the Chicago Loop. The grandeur of its fabled history is still evident, and the management is continually upgrading the rooms and common areas to bring back much of the original lustre while making the hotel rooms more updated and comfortable. Everything you would expect from a 4-5 star hotel is there with regard to services and facilities. There are many reasons to stay here. While the majority of the rooms are not super-luxury (I am sure you can get some that are if you want to pay for that), they are very nice with updated amenities, pleasant decor in tones of dark woods, and fabrics in lime, raspberry, crisp white and black, and are a comfortable size by Chicago standards. The location is terrific, situated between the Red Line by the west entrance, and the Brown, Green, Orange, Purple and Pink Lines by the east entrance, it is really easy to get around town, or get to/from O'Hare or Midway. The theatre district, State Street shopping, Art Institute, Orchestra Hall right outside, and Union Station is a ten minute walk. I have also found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I read some of the other reviews and have never experienced any of the problems that some of them described. Check in is pleasant, elevators are fast, rooms are sparkling with the new decor, common areas (such as the lobby) are truly impressive and beautiful, and even the hallways have classic pictures of the numerous celebrities who have stayed here in the golden age of stage and film. Yes, parking (especially valet) is expensive, but - welcome to Chicago! That is the way it will be anywhere downtown. Also, in a business hotel such as this, the amenities you expect do come at a price. Internet is costly, and if you want coffee you order it from room service rather than make it yourself, etc. This is not a Hampton Inn, it is The Palmer House. I certainly understand that these expenses can mount up and get out of hand quickly, so I suggest parking free outside of the city and taking the CTA, Metra or Amtrak instead. My round trip train tickets from Normal IL are around $22 round trip whereas parking downtown can be $40 per day. Stop at the Corner Bakery downstairs and enjoy your coffee there while people watching on Wabash, then get a free refill and take that to your room if you don't want to do room service. Use your smartphone to check e-mail and websites rather than hooking up your laptop. Enjoy some of the incredible (and inexpensive) restaurants nearby such as the Flat Top Grill or the Eleven City Diner, and use the CTA rather than drive or take taxis. The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star review is that there are newer hotels in the Loop that have larger rooms with larger windows, larger and more updated bathrooms, and better views. But that should not overshadow the fact that this is a wonderful hotel in one of THE most wonderful cities in the country.

Reception said this was \"upgrade, special large room\". Room was large (huge actually), but totally bare except for bed, one arm-chair, small desk, and old small TV on a little dresser at distant far end of room. Room was barren, depressing, and dimly lit. Dirty carpet. Room had an strange wet bar alcove with an ugly partially dismantled sink. Wallpaper peeling, paint dirty, dim lighting. No amenities whatsoever- just two water glasses and an ice bucket. Small windows with view onto an air-shaft. Bathroom tiny, shabby, old, 1950s style, could barely get in the door. Nothing charming about this room - all just old and shabby. Last straw - sound proofing was so bad that I was woken at 6am by people talking in normal quiet voices next door - I could have easily joined their conversation. Complained the next morning and reception then moved me to 'modern' room 20-209 for second night. This room was tiny, old style TV, barely room for a bed, small dresser, and desk. I suppose it had been renovated, since style was 1970 instead of 1950. Dirty carpet, peeling wallpaper in bathroom. Single small window with 'view' of a hotel wall 50 feet away. At least it was quiet. By way of apology, reception gave me a $25 certificate usable only in hotel restaurant. Big deal - at least it paid for breakfast. Valet parking was $100 for two days! Rates not posted outside when I checked in, so this was total surprise and shock. Internet was wired and slow, for $19 a day. Elevators were incredibly slow - sometimes had to wait 5 minutes for one. My business associate was visiting from China and I'd hoped to show him a good Chicago experience. Palmer House was a big mistake. He had the same problem as I did with his room - he was first booked into a 'large' room, also found it barren and shabby, immediately asked to be moved to a 'better' room, which was small and shabby. As a Hilton Honors member, I've often been upgraded to the Executive Floor. Not possible this time since hotel was full. No great loss though - I peeked into the Exec \"Breakfast Lounge\" on the 23rd floor, and as far as I could see all they'd done was crowd some tables and chairs into the elevator lobby on that floor. Finally at checkout, they confused my associate's booking with someone else and only after some prompting did the front desk search their database to find and print the correct invoice for his expense report. Everyone at reception was nice and polite, but they were far from efficient. Yes, the lobby is impressive, so maybe nice to stop in and see this place as a tourist attraction. But as a hotel to stay in, forget it. Rooms are Motel 6 quality at a premium price. Yes, it's a 'good location' near Millenneum Park, Mag Mile, etc, but there are a dozen other hotels in the same area. PS. I provided exactly this same information in an online Hilton survey. Next week I did get a call from someone in the Palmer House Maintenance Department (maintenance? this place needs a major remodeling). He offered my a free one-night stay, which I declined (why would I want to repeat this miserable experience) and then offered 50,000 points, worth one free night at another Hilton property.

Chief on our list was the lack of an in-room refrigerator or coffee maker. Our leftovers became waterlogged when we tried to keep them cool in the ice bucket and the bag broke, and having to go downstairs and wait in line for Starbucks is much less convenient (and more expensive) than brewing coffee in your own room. Also the pool was extremely small, the TV was outdated, and the number of elevators servicing our floor was inadequate. Internet was extremely expensive (nearly $20/day).

The Hotel This is an impressive hotel. The lobby area is beautiful and certainly has the wow factor. There are some small shops and a Starbucks located on the ground-level, with the Reception and Concierge on the upper ground level. As a result of the size of the hotel, some of the rooms can be a few minutes walk from the elevator - absolutely no issue for us, but if you have mobility problems it might be worth requesting a room close to the elevator. The Rooms We stayed in a room with 2 double beds. The room was very spacious with modern decor and was a very nice place to rest. The room had a TV, desk / dressing table & chair, 2 telephones, an easy chair with foot stool, 2 double beds each with bedside tables, 2 wardrobes, bathroom with bath and shower, and a hairdryer. We found the room to be very clean (with the exception of a used tissue in the sink on arrival!) and it was maintained well throughout our stay. Our only gripe is that there was no mini-bar and no tea / coffee making facilities and, for the price of the room, I would expect both of these things. I assume that the lack of these facilities was to encourage guests to use the (quite expensive) bar in the lobby and the (similarly expensive) Starbucks franchise on the ground-level. The beds were very conformable and we certainly had lots of space in the room. Staff We found the staff, without exception, to be helpful and friendly. The Concierge staff were very accommodating and were more than happy to make all reservations for us. Door staff similarly were very helpful and had taxis waiting within seconds. Location The hotel is located just inside the Loop on East Monroe about a ten minute walk to Millennium Park and the Harbour and about a 5 minute walk to Macy's and other shops. We walked almost everywhere from here and found the majority of places to be easily accessible. A walk to the Shedd Aquarium / Soldier Park took us about 50 minutes, but this was a gentle stroll along the harbour, and could be done in less if you walked with purpose! There are El stations just outside the hotel, and a couple of nice bars / eateries just next door to the hotel (The Exchequer Pub & Restaurant offers a discount to Palmer House Hotel guests).

Thankfully, despite booking on a 3rd party website, they were able to accommodate my request even though the hotel seemed to be near capacity for the weekend. The hotel room was extremely large (it looks like they combined two rooms during the renovation) with a nice sitting area in front of the king bed. The room was clean with no signs of wear, but despite being recently renovated (within the last couple years) it did not have a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very small, and my girlfriend and I found it hard to be in the bathroom at the same time to get ready. The room was extremely quiet - you can occasionally hear the L outside, but this was not noticeable at night. For me, one downside was that the building seems to slow down internet connections on mobile phones. Since I did not want to pay for internet, this was annoying when I needed to get a few things done. The hotel has a great location!

I found the service and staff to be very nice and efficient. The on site restaurants are a little pricey but the food and service was good. On my first day, I needed a fast lunch.

He asked if we needed assistance with our luggage to which we answered yes, he proceeded to give us our ticket and said we were all set. We then stepped in to a very impressive lobby (which is all that was impressive in this hotel) and waited in a long line to check in. The front desk clerk acknowledged that we booked through Priceline and assigned us a room, whcih was to have a been a room to accommodate 2 adults. We then entered a very TINY room that consisted of about 120 sq feet and a single bed. We promptly realized that this would not be acceptable accommodations for two people, as guaranteed by priceline, and returned to the front desk. At the desk we were informed that there are no guarantees when booking through Priceline, that we pay less than their other guests, therefore the rooms are assigned to the full paying guests and Priceline customers get the remaining rooms. After some argument we were able to be assigned another room. This room was slightly larger in size and included a \"Queen bed\" a little room to walk around it and a very small bathroom. There was construction outside of our room. The room had peeling wallpaper in multiple areas and was very dated with an old tube television and dated bathroom fixtures. It did not meet my expectation when I think of a \"4-Star\" hotel. The hotel did provide a 15x25 foot pool to accommodate it's over 1,000 rooms. It had a fee to use it's fitness room, a fee to use it's wired internet (as there was no Wi-Fi available)and we were not able to use the concierge due to an extensive line, therefore we chose to fend for ourselves rather than spend hours in line.

As other posters have mentioned before, there is no wifi in the rooms or in the lobby (we inquired about access in the lobby but were told that it wasn't available to us).

We had some Hilton Honors points that reduced the room price (a lot), and since we had saved some money, we splurged and upgraded to the Executive Level. Boy, was that worth it. We were roomed on the top floor at the far back end of the \"wings.\" The great thing about the room location was that no one would tromp by there unless they had reason to be there. The bed was soooooo comfortable. The shower? Amazing. Really - we both came out of it saying \"wow, that was a great shower.\" The exec. level also has a couple \"private\" express elevators that keep you from having to stop at all the other floors on the way down, which is probably a nice perk. We both really enjoyed the complimentary exec level continental breakfast, and we had just enough space to do our video workout in the hotel room. All the staff members we talked to were super friendly and helpful. The location is AWESOME. You can practically live in that hotel and never leave the building. There were some downsides, of course. Some major things to be aware of: 1 - parking is expensive (but it's downtown Chicago, so what do you honestly expect? Every place downtown is like that.) 2 - Wifi is not gratis. There were 2 computers on our floor that people could use for free, but they were always in use. This does annoy me, especially at expensive hotels. (Again, unfortunately, it's downtown Chicago, so what do you honestly expect? In my limited experience of staying at hotels at this price in big cities, NOTHING is included. So, it's on par with my experience of staying at, say, Westin, except this room was MUCH quieter.) 3 - The health club is $10 a day, but I heard it was quite nice. If you have HHonors, you can get discounts depending on your level of membership. We decided against it. 4 - The pool looked nice, and no one was in there. That had to be because the music in that room was horribly loud, and the speakers were blown and sounded scratchy and awful. I usually love to soak in the hot tubs, but I had no desire to spend ANY time in there. 5 - On the more nit-picky side: my husband thought the exec level snacks could have been better (I thought they were awesome). Although we requested non-smoking, the room did have a slightly faint odor of smoke to it, as though someone snuck into the bathroom and smoked there. We determined that it was the shower curtain, but it wasn't a strong smell at all. We got used to it immediately, and we did not notice it on our clothing or luggage when we left the building or returned home. The TV was old and had a habit of turning the screen off and on while it was warming up (it stopped eventually). Also, the Potter Bar had only mediocre drinks and small plates of food at expensive hotel prices. All in all, even with the negatives above, we loved our stay and had a great time.

While there we stayed on the Executive floors, which included access to The Executive Lounge and offered up a lovely deluxe continental breakfast, with the best porrtidge I have ever had, and a very enjoyable afternoon Happy Hour which included hot hors d'ouvres and a fully stocked bar. Beer, wine and mixed drinks were at extra charge, but the hors d'ouvres and soft drinks, coffee, etc. were all complimentary with our Executive floor rooms. Ernest, who kept the tables clear of dishes from our snacks, offerd his own brand of friendliness that was very genuine. The staff always acknowledged us, especially the maids every morning and evening when we walked to or from our comfortable room. At one point, while my wife and I sat in the Lobby bar, a security person named Dave, came over and politely asked my wife to not hang her purse off the back of her chair, as it was a temptation to pick-pockets. We appreciated his vigelance. Everyone there was what you hope to experience when you travel. I would completely reccomend this hotel for anyone enjoying the sights and sounds of one of my favorite destinations, Chicago. Mike T.

I will say that the concierge and bell staff is absolutely exceptional. For example, I had a question about parking and asked the bell man. He was unable to answer me, but then later sought me out to give me an answer. That is above and beyond service and is definetely appreciated. I have stayed at the Palmer House several times. The first time I had the lovely accomodations which included two bathrooms and absolutely fabulous fixtures and finishes. The second time I was put into a room where the wall paper was falling off the wall, the fixtures were rusted, and the tile in the bathroom was moldy. I literally threw a fit and was granted a free voucher for my next stay. That brings me to my most recent stay. I was once again put into a not-very-nice room with rusty fixtures, a dirty bathroom, and scratched furniture. Since it was free, I was okay with it. But thank goodness I was only staying one night. I travel quite a bit, and I will tell you that I've stayed in nicer hotels in the middle of nowhere Wisconsin (for example the AmericInn). The lobby of the Palmer House is outstanding. The vibe is wonderful, the restoration is beautifully done. The food and drink is delicious. My recommendation is that the Hilton people find a way to improve their dumpy rooms ASAP. I will continue to recommend the Palmer house for a drink and dinner, but will advise all travelers to be sure to specify one of the suite rooms (green decor) if they choose to stay there.

As a Hilton customer for many years, and a former Diamond HHonors member, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the opportunity to stay in many Hilton properties. The problems I noted make me wonder if you ever visit or use the average rooms in your hotel (you should, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). I also wonder why these things are not reported to maintenance by the housekeeping staff. Is there no QA or QC function that randomly tests all aspects of a room (there should be, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not)? Closet The closet door will not stay open, so while I was standing in the closet working with my clothes, it kept hitting me in my back. The string on the closet light is way too long and right in your face and shoulders when trying to get your clothes. A hotel of this type should have a wall switch, at least, or more appropriately a switch built into the jamb so that the light comes on when the door is opened. At the very least, the light string should not be placed so as to hit people in the face when they try to use the closet. Bathroom Again, the door won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in the closed position without being latched. The room is so small that the door can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be left in the fully open position when showering. So, you have no choice but to latch it, which causes an excessive amount of moisture in the room, due to no active ventilation, as evidenced by peeling paint on the ceiling. Due, I suppose to the passive vent being in the shower, the curtain wants to suck in to the shower, giving a person no room to shower. To avoid that, one must rest it on the tub lip, and then the floor floods. The placement of the soap holders on the side wall of the shower is in the almost exact position someone has to stand in to use the shower, which makes the shower extremely narrow in that critical spot. The lack of thought that goes into things like this never ceases to amaze me. Put those things on the front or back wall (or just nearer the front or back of the sidewall), and the problem is solved. Given the curtain sucking in and the soap holder placement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very narrow shower, indeed! The lighting globes were installed crookedly, and the GFI outlet was amazingly crooked. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you or your staff have any pride in how your rooms look? Service The TV listing in your Guest Directory is inaccurate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the channels do not match up with the TV. Do you know how frustrating it is to try and watch TV after a long day of travel and work, and you have no idea what channel is what. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very frustrating to try to find the channels and to remember where they are. I pointed the problem out to the front desk clerk (Vera, I think, on 10-18), and she seemed surprised. It would not be a surprise if there was a QA function. Who is charged with keeping that book up to date? What else was wrong it in (e.g., safety information)? I asked the front desk for an updated listing that morning before I left for work, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor did I get an explanation of why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very sorry service. I assume my book was not the only one outdated, so all of your customers are suffering. When I attempted to use the Zip-Out checkout on the phone, I only heard a few clicks and then another dial tone. There was nothing in the instructions on the phone or on the receipt to indicate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the way it worked. As it seemed to be malfunctioning, I waited in a long line at the front desk to checkout - again, a very frustrating encounter that could have been easily avoided by disclosing simple information. Someone (everyone?) at the hotel needs to approach the hotel through the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be frustrated while in my hotel. If I stay at the Palmer House again, how will you ensure these things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recur? The receipt says to send feedback to commentsph@hilton.com, but if that is supposed to be a web link, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I hope it works as an email address.

(Room 10-212) This room had the smallest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel and I travel a lot! The toilet was situated between a vanity top and a wall with about 20 inches of room. I won't go into any more. The wallpaper is peeling in the bathroom and the floor is supposed to be white tile I believe. Check-in was long and frustrating. The lines were terrible and the staff appeared to confused. Every front desk transaction seemed to baffle the staff there. The rooms at the hotel are not cheap. Parking is not cheap and it seems to be the biggest rip off to pay so much for so little.

The history is fascinating and the decor is stunning. The rooms are well appointed, but alas, missing most of the complimentary amenities (such as free or ANY in-room Wi-Fi, coffee maker) making it necessary to shell out for any extras, whether for wired in-room internet or a coffee at the downstairs Starbucks. If you're used to luxury hotels, this won't come as a surprise. If you're used to mid-range hotels who put out a lot of amenities to compete, you'll not find that kind of \"free\" here. For example, you pay to use the fitness centre, which is very clean with the standard equipment. The concierge service in this hotel is remarkably poor for such a classy place. You pretty much have to do your own research unless it's for basic directions. I think with some advanced notice they could accommodate you, but were weak when asked things on the fly. On the upside, they do have a written list of restaurants really close by with great after-hours dining if you'd rather not spend time at the bistro in their beautiful lobby. However, it's probably good to know they will always recommend their hotel dining (even if for a coffee--kind of lame). Along with being a very old building, the walls are thin and you can hear a lot of noise between the rooms and halls. Nothing that kept me awake. On a sad note, on the last day of our stay my mom had an empty purse stolen from our room. The security took this concern very seriously, but it didn't result in any satisfaction. We were left wondering if the hotel staff took it, or a stranger walking by with the door open (as they maid service doesn't seem very conscientious about security when cleaning rooms).

I was excited I was booked into the Palmer House and was expecting a real treat. Sadly, after 2 nights in the property I left feeling somewhat indifferent about the place. I arrived after a long flight and a long wait at immigration so I was looking forward to getting to my room quickly and freshening up. The first thing that put me off was the pink light bulbs in the overhang on East Monroe. It makes the hotel look like something out of Fremont Street in Las Vegas. And then the fact that you need to find your way to registration, dragging your luggage up the stairway. There are escalators and elevators but they're at the back of the street level floor. I found them on the 2nd day but they were not apparent when I arrived. The line at the HHonors desk was longer than the standard one and staff seemed to take an age to serve folks. Armed with my key cards I headed up to the 19th floor and to my room. Because of the sheer number of rooms and corridors, it did seem like a bit of a labyrinth to find my room. The room itself was ok, but paper and paint were peeling off the wall and the TV was a 1990s clunky Philips version. There were no free bottles of water in the room nor a coffee machine. The bathroom was fine, complete with Peter Roth shampoos and conditioners. The bed was comfortable but there was no wireless internet, just standard wired version. So - like The Drake Hilton - totally useless if you want to use your iPhone or iPad. I had access to the exec lounge on the 23rd floor but it's very odd. As soon as you arrive in the elevator, you walk straight into the lounge. The free breakfast was ok, not the best, unless you like filling up on carbs (pastries, cereals, bagels etc). The only healthy option was apples and bananas. They have a bar service in the evening but you have to pay for liquor, so I don't get how it offers anything different from the bar in the lobby area. The fitness area is nice, it's on the 8th floor but you are charged $5 for the pleasure of working out. There is a pool too, but I never had time to use it. The restaurant in the lobby area was nice, great service and good food. However the bar was terrible. Too few staff to meet the demand of the guests.

In fact, we were put in an 'Apollo' room which is a huge suite, like a living soom, with seperate bed ROOMS doored on each end--which were locked as they were each booked; hence no beds. It was at least another hour to procure 3 rollaway beds as well as track down our checked in luggage.

The king room I was given was without saying the smallest (and using the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is generous) hotel room that I ever stayed in. The bathroom, very clean and updated, but so small (again, using the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is generous) that the door could not open all the way inward because it hit the toilet. There would be no possible way that two guests could be in that bathroom at the same time, unless one was standing in the very clean, tub. But, my sister and I were in Chicago to sightsee and reconnect, so little time was spent in my room, and we spent a lot of time in the grand lobby.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSmall loud rooms\u201d", "Author": "Bucketlistm", "ReviewID": "UR118627509", "Content": "This hotel is old old old.

I was in Chicago for 5 days for a medical meeting. My wife accompanied me as she enjoys Chicago. I made my reservations through my medical organization as this was one of the 'meeting' hotels. I was one of the latter ones to decide to go and the PH was the only one of the groups hotels that still had rooms available. The Good: the location within the 'loop' is excellent. It is easy to get everywhere downtown. There is a nearby 'L' train station with multiple lines just outside the exit. The lobby is large, multistory and speaks of an age now gone. (Although close observation shows some fraying around the edges. ) The staff (maids, bellmen and doormen) seemed truly friendly and attentive. I will say that the climate control in the room was good and allowed you to select a specific temperature. The Bad: Even though, I was early, there was a cue at the check-in desk. Check-in was not fast or efficient even though I had a confirmed reservation. Because of some function in the lobby, my spouse was unable to find a spot to sit while waiting for me. The room on the 17th floor had the king-sized bed that I had requested but the room itself was old, tired and small. The closet door was stuck, had an old key lock that made me think at first it was a door to the room next door. The room had not been updated to modern ammenities, there was no coffee maker, refrigerator or minibar. The TV, which was an old tube type, was in a large armoire which took up precious space. The bathroom was small and was the worst. The fixtures looked like rejects from Motel 6. The toilet seat was the cheapest looking plastic model I have ever seen. The towel rack over the tub, was flimsy and pulling out of the wall. The tub itself did not drain adequately even with the shower head on low-flow. Before you were done with your shower, you were standing in 2 inches of water. The final insult for me was the $14/day charge for internet access. Wireless was only available in the lobby (for the $) or a wired connection in the room. My 'convention' rate was in the high $200s and the rooms would have cost >$300 if obtained through another source. In 2011, I cannot understand this.

Very good experience at check-in as I told the clerk that I had heard (and read) that \"some\" of the rooms were on the small side -since I was going to be there for an extended time could they find me a larger room, which they did (although 2 queens instead of a king bed). As you can read elsewhere, the lobby is quite nice, and the entire hotel is living history well-preserved. The lobby bar is a fun place to hang out and the lobby in general is full of activity at night. The hotel is huge with banks of elevators serving groupings of floors - expect longer than reasonable delays at peak hours (old hotel, old elevators). The hotel is very big, the walk to the room can be far... the room was fine, nothing special - although it was pretty large based on my request :) No flat screen LCD/LED TV here, just a cheap old 27\" tube TV, no coffee maker in room, no mini-bar, and NO WIRELESS INTERNET IN ROOM. One of my co-workers told me that the front desk provided him with a wireless router for his room upon request, I stuck with the in-room wired connection during my stay. Again ,the rooms are older, have been updated (although mine still had the very old AC/HEAT controls), clean, beds were comfortable, but nothing really that special. I guess people aren't staying here for the \"great\" rooms but you can't sleep in the lobby :) Ordered room service a few times - no need to order more than that as there are only about 10 items on the menu, VERY limited selection for such a \"large and prestigious hotel\" - or for any hotel for that matter. Careful if you order the \"bottled water\" as they will bring you the $5 glass bottle - the front desk gave me free bottled water whenever I stopped by and asked, although only once was it cold. There is no coffee service in the lobby either and unless you pre-order coffee the night before be prepared to wait (i was told 45 minutes or longer for room service, weekdays and weekend) - your only on-site options are the hotel restaurant or the Starbucks on ground floor (the street level \"S\"). If you arrive at the Starbucks between 7:30 and 9:30 be prepared to wait as the line got very long - I would suggest one of the many places on the block as an alternative if you are looking for a quick breakfast at a reasonable price (or the Starbucks across the street).

Having said that, I guess I am satisfied, considering the rate I got. However, booking through this website did not guarantee a specific room, and when I arrived, I was told that there were only smoking rooms still available. Much to my surprise, in Illinois there can still be smoking rooms at hotels. We are clearly NOT smokers, and I'm not sure if I was taken or not, but we were offered an upgrade for $49/night for a king non-smoking room on the Executive Level. Observing our hesitancy to upgrade (remember, I booked the room at a discount rate for a reason), we were quickly offered another room on the Executive Level for $39/night. Detesting the smell of cigarette smoke, I went ahead and took the upgrade and still paid less than the advertised rate. The hotel itself is beautiful, nistoric etc., and in an ok location, down near Grant & Millenium Park, and is close to bus routes that will take you to Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, etc. However, being woke up at midnight because of a woman in the next room pleading with someone to not go out displeased me. Having heard her in normal conversation earlier in the day and clearly understanding her every word I realized that the walls were very thin, and feared that this would become a problem later in the evening. I was right. Second negative on the hotel was the size of the bathroom. There was NO counter space, whatsoever, and only 1 standing spot in the tiny bath. Third negative....no free wi-fi, no free exercise room....it all cost extra. Oh, on the executive floor, there are two computers to use, and that served our purpose for our weekend trip. Another negative for some....near the train, so you can hear every one that goes by...even on the 23rd floor, but that noise didn't bother us nearly as much as the aforementioned female in the next room. Executive Level guests get free continental breakfast every morning...too many carbs for me...went elsewhere....and hors d'oeuvres every evening.....which was a nice touch. Free non-alcoholic beverages 24/7 to Executive Level guests, and private bar service on the 23rd floor (not free, obviously, but convenient).

We decided to stay at the Palmer Hilton because it was downtown, had a pool, was a Hilton hotel and had cheaper (still expensive) parking than other hotels. Originally, we booked through Marlin Travel for 179.99/night. We requested a king size bed but when we got there, we were arranged 2 doubles. They offered to upgrade to a king with premium services; orderves from 5-9pm, unlimited non-alcoholic drinks and snacks all day and a contiential breakfast for 39.99/night for the upgrade. We decided to upgrade. So the room was 179.99 + 39.99 for the upgrade + 37 dollars for self parking (they wanted 61 for valet). The building was beautiful in the lobby. The staff were so nice and courteous.Plenty of weddings and events were going on and I can see why. It looked as though you were in the middle of Italy with a painted ceiling and columns around. However. The room was small. Very small. There was no couch, just a basic bed, basic desk and a TUBE tv. The remote hardly worked. The bathroom was most disappointing. You could not sit on the toilet with the door open as it would hit your knees. The door also hit the bathrub when opened. You couldn't get ready in the morning without closing the door. The shower head was a duel-like shower which was the only benefit. There was no seperate shower. The room also did not have a mini fridge, it did have a safe though. The pool was nice- it had a nice skylight. It was also nice that the hottub was seperate from the pool. The towels in the pool area were very nice.

It is a very, very large hotel with a floor plan that can be a bit confusing. Similar to being on a cruise ship (or driving in the Northeast), there are routes where you can't get there from here or you may get lost. Another guest in our party quipped that he could get to his room from the lobby, but once in his room, he could never find the original elevator bank. If you are staying in your room and only going to the restaurant, lobby, and street levels, you will probably find a consistent route. However, if you are in the meeting rooms you may find the path needed to get to your destination a bit counter-intuitive. - The rooms are comfortably appointed. My room (King bed) was laid out well and comfortably appointed. I was in the \"101\" block and therefore right next to the elevators. There was some noise from guests returning to their rooms, but nothing noticeable after 11pm or which woke me up. The linens are of a high quality which would be expected in this level of hotel. Bathroom was small, but one of the best lit I've seen. Good bath amenities (PeterThomasRoth). Closet had real coat hangers and a good number of them. - Meeting rooms were very comfortable (both temperature and layout) and catering did a very nice job with lunches and breaks. Breakfast was not as good (scrambled eggs were a little gritty and the type of bread laid out on day one was different than day two). A nice variety of coffee (reg/decaf), teas, and sodas was available. Great cookies! (I liked the oatmeal ones best.) - I did not eat at the restaurant, but did eat at the Potter's Lounge (bar). Drinks were average. Cheese Poufs were uninspired and the sauce could not hold up to the overwhelming taste of the breading. I stopped after two. Soups (mushroom on day one and squash on day two) were very, very good. The service was a bit lax; however I could not tell 100% if it was the server or the kitchen. I had chosen to eat at the bar to have a quick bite, I was there for over 90 minutes my first day. - Big plus was a scotch tasting in the lobby. I'm not a scotch drinker, but it was fun. - Because I was there over the 09/11 anniversary, security was heightened, but not overwhelming. The communicated well with the guests, providing a letter in each room explaining that there would be additional scrutiny and additional personnel at the elevator banks; but it never felt oppressive or overwhelming. Security was very friendly, willing to interact with guests, and willing and able to answer questions.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vitoria, ES", "Title": "\u201cHAD A GREAT TIME, but had to fight for.\u201d", "Author": "ElcioBR", "ReviewID": "UR118033384", "Content": "When I booked the hotel I requested an upgrade for a suite, but when I checked in this was not available, at least that was the information I got.

We and another couple ended up at the Palmer because our choices were limited due to the enormous volume of marathon participants in town. We chose not to stay somewhere outside of the city and have to commute in and out. While we may be able to afford the occasional stay at $200+ per night hotel, we typically choose to stay at more reasonably priced places. This particular hotel stay is a prime example of why... The Palmer House Hilton is a historical building with a beautiful lobby. There are other nice features, such as the multitude of black and white portraits lining the hallways. These portraits of of the many stars that have played the hotel's Empire Room in years past. Pretty cool... But, of course, we didn't sleep in the lobby or the hallway. Instead, we slept in a room on the 12th floor that I would call simply, underwhelming. I've slept in $120 rooms at the Holiday Inn Express and other similar hotels across the mid-west that were every bit as comfortable and well adorned as this room. I will say that this room was a bit bigger than those at the other hotels I mentioned, but our friends' room was about the same size as the ones at those other, cheaper hotels. In truth, the extended size of our room served only to increase the distance between our bed and the small, tube-screen television, making it appear even smaller. If our bathroom was an inch smaller in any direction, quite literally, they wouldn't have been able to fit a tub, sink and toilet into it. It was clean, but just plain awkward. The room our friends were in across the hallway had a less awkward bathroom and reasonable floor space. HOWEVER, their room came with a dirty XXXL t-shirt laying between the bed pillows on one of their two double beds. Yuk. A call to the front desk, prompted a visit to their room from a housekeeping manager who appeared irritated that this had happened and offered suitable compensation. HOWEVER, the manager chewed the maid a new one (if you get my meaning) in front of us all while the maid argued with her, swearing that she had changed the bed in question. (Awkward! And, um, no you did not!) So, the manager leaves the maid to change the bedding. After the manager was out of sight, the maid proceeds to reprimand our friends for calling the front desk instead of hunting her down and telling her personally!!! She also told them that the manager was new and \"not good\". I'm sorry, but I'm thinking the previous manager was the \"not good\" one and was replaced with a better one. Now this slacker employee doesn't like her new manager because she can no longer get away with skimping on her duties. Anyway, the moral of my story is, anyone can walk in off the street without paying a dime and enjoy the view in the lobby of a hotel like this one. But paying $200+ to stay in a room that you can get elsewhere at half the price just doesn't make sense to me. Summary - Beautiful exterior and lobby. Expensive rooms with little benefit.

Thanks to a nice corporate rate we got a great deal and were on the 21st floor in room 2134. The view from the windows was 90% Courtyard, 10% street. There isn't a reason to open the curtains in your room unless you want to look into the rooms across from you. The room was very big with a King bed and large living area with a 90s style tube TV. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever had in a hotel by quite a bit. If there is another person in the bathroom you pretty much cant open the door to get in unless they are in the shower. Our room had a large room in the corner that served as a bar area with a big stainless steel sink set-up meant to make some serious drinks. I'm not really sure what the purpose of this was but it would be nice if we had a lot of friends in the room with us I suppose. We didn't spend much time at the hotel except to sleep so I cant comment on anything other than the lobby and room. Check in was VERY slow, over half an hour for sure and probably closer to 45 minutes in line. The reason for this was the huge amount of people checking in all at once for Lollapalooza but no one seemed in any kind of hurry to get people checked in. It wasn't until we got to the front of the line that we saw there was a separate line for Hilton HHonors members (which we are) and this would have saved a lot of time. There is no on-site parking. They have valet parking for $61 a day or self park across the street for $38. Grant Park was only a 5-10 minute walk depending on how crowded the streets were, so if you are in town for Lollapalooza or an even in Millennium or Grant Park this is an ideal hotel and one of the closest of the classy hotels.

As Hilton Hhonors Diamond members, we always check prices and availability for Hilton-branded properties first. The location of this hotel appealed to us for several reasons. It is one block from the blue line, so it's a snap to get there from O'Hare (Monroe/Dearborn). The hotel is on the same block as the red line, which was handy for getting to our dinner at Alinea (North/Clybourne). The hotel is one block from the green line (Monroe), which worked well for our visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright's Home and Studio in Oak Park (Harlem). The hotel spans nearly an entire city block, with entrances on Monroe, Wabash, and State Streets (there is no entrance from Adams). There are two CVS pharmacies and two 7-11 convenience stores within a block of the hotel, in case you are looking for a store purchase drinks and snacks for your room. The hotel is one block from Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the Art Institute. The public spaces of the hotel are gorgeous, particularly the soaring painted ceiling in the lobby, off which the Lockwood Restaurant and Bar is found. The lobby itself has a bar, surrounded by additional comfortable seating. Potter's Lounge is accessed from the street level, where there is a Starbucks and small shopping arcade (gift shop, shoe store). The indoor pool is small but adequate. The hotel has an odd configuration. The lobby is on the second level, not the street level, so it is necessary to bring your luggage either up the escalator, elevator, or stairs to check in; however, there is a bellman at the Wabash Street entrance. Both the Wabash Street entrance and the Monroe Street entrances are staffed by doormen who can help you hail a taxi. It seems like the hotel is comprised of several different buildings, along with several different elevator banks; it is necessary to find the correct elevator that will take you to your desired floor, because not all elevators stop on all floors. The Executive Level elevators (and lounge) require key card access. Keep in mind that many of the rooms are TINY! We checked in the day before online, and after reading all the possible room options available to us, we chose the description that stated LARGE ROOM, LARGE BATHROOM. Other descriptions claimed SMALL ROOM, SMALL BATHROOM, NOISY ROOM, and the like, so we felt that we got lucky with room 10171. There was no upgrade offered to us as Diamond members, even though we had booked the second-to-lowest category of room (the lowest being a DOUBLE room with one DOUBLE bed); the hotel was not full, either. Upon seeing the room, if that was a LARGE room, I would dread seeing what the SMALL rooms looked like. Although it would have been possible for the room to be a bit smaller (there was an arm chair in addition to a desk with a chair), I don't see how the bathroom could have been any smaller unless you had to stand in the bathtub or atop the toilet to close the door. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room was attractive and modern, but the size prohibited us from enjoying a relaxing space. On the third day of our stay, we didn't receive service on our room until about 4:00 pm (despite departing the room at 8:00 am), at which time we were showering and dressing for an early dinner. To be fair, we asked the maid to return in an hour after we had departed for dinner, and she did service our room while we were gone. The room had no mini-bar, which we found odd - it's a quick and easy way for a hotel to make a few extra bucks on the guests - although in our room, there was no space to allot for that amenity. Our room had an interior courtyard view, but at least it let in some natural light. Our major complaint about the room occurred on the evening of our second night, when my spouse, dressing for dinner, skimmed a bare foot along the dust ruffle of the bed and withdrew it with a USED CONDOM attached! It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much more DISGUSTING than that! We immediately telephoned the front desk - and our call was put on hold - then we called the concierge - and our call was placed on hold again - and finally, we called the special guest services number (I think it we dialed 26 on the phone) - also to be put on hold! Because we were preparing to depart for dinner, we attempted to stop by the executive lounge to voice our discovery (no one was manning the desk), as well as the concierge (where the lines were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a mile long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) and finally, the Hhonors front reception desk (where there were no long lines, but where every desk attendant appeared to be waiting on the non-Hhonors patrons). We just wanted to tell someone about our \"find\", as well as have it removed from our room, but no one was available. Later that evening, we left a message with the front desk staff for the manager; we were told that NO MANAGER WAS ON DUTY ON WEEKENDS, which is a bit disconcerting for a hotel of this size. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how a routine cleaning of a room wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remove such a personal item. The room assumably had a thorough cleaning after the previous customer had checked-out, and we ourselves had some type of service after our initial night stay. It wasn't as if my spouse had gotten on his hands and knees and looked under the bed, or that we had arrived with an ultraviolet black light searching for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creepy crawlies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so there's no reason why a maid's vacuum cleaner did not uncover the condom. We spend a lot of nights in hotels, some of them at lesser Hilton properties than this full-service Hilton (for example, Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns) and never has this happened before! Apparently, spending extra money on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd properties guarantees you some extra personal-care items! We never received a call from the manager, although we did receive a message from the maid asking us to call and discuss the matter, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to do. The executive lounge was a bit disappointing - extremely crowded on the weekends at both breakfast and evening cocktails. The breakfast buffet was small but adequate - pastries/muffins/bagels, fresh fruit (whole not sliced), hard-cooked eggs, sliced luncheon meats, hot oatmeal, yogurt, juices, flavored waters, and coffee. The evening cocktail hour featured sliced fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and dip, and some hot hors d'oeuvre items, along with complimentary non-alcoholic beverages. My spouse purchased a beer, which was $6; I'm not sure if that was a \"deal\" as compared to what they were charging in the lobby bar, nor could we compare the price to that of the mini-bar because our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one. From the sizable crowds in the executive lounge, it seems that everyone is either a Gold or Diamond Hhonors member these days, although no one really checked guests in and verified that they belonged there. We saw many extended families, some with as many as 6 family members, staking out places in the lounge and partaking of the freebies. Key card access is required to access the lounge from the lobby or street level, but with the many additional elevators and staircases in the hotel, you can get around that if you know how. Overall, this was a disappointing stay, and we would not recommend this hotel, which is a shame, really, because the location is great. We could overlook the size of the room (even though it was billed as LARGE but to us appeared SMALL), but the whole USED CONDOM ISSUE is pretty unforgivable!", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yonkers, New York", "Title": "\u201cHistoric Hotel, Super Location\u201d", "Author": "John Z", "ReviewID": "UR117415104", "Content": "Grand hotel, our room was very small, but it was only a one night stay, so the location and amenities made up for it.

They failed to inform us at check in that we needed coupon for the free breakfast, but we quickly got one at the front desk. Checkout was at 12, but we requested a late checkout and was told that we could extend it to 1 at no additional charge. We asked about extending it to 3 pm and was told it would be an additional $50. The only advice I would give is to not book any tours through the Gray Line tour company that is located inside the hotel. We did and were very, very disappointed!", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cClassic Hotel - nice rooms and location\u201d", "Author": "GATravelGuy", "ReviewID": "UR117235565", "Content": "I have stayed here numerous times over that past year for business.

I am a Hilton Honors member and booked this hotel on points (though none of the others did, so this review shouldn't be read as a raving review by someone who gets perks or anything). I arrived early, and upon stepping into the lobby it quite literally took my breath away. It's STUNNING. Check in was very fast, I was able to get into my room at 10:30 am (regular check in is at 3pm) and I was just in awe the whole time. I made it to my floor and eventually found my room (word to the wise...this place can be a little maze-like in the hallways, but with 1639 rooms that's understandable!) the room was impeccable (albeit a little warm) and decorated beautifully. There were some things that seemed outdated though, such as the small-ish (for the size of the room) tube tv and the extremely small bathroom (read: door could not open the whole way or it would hit the tub) the bathroom size may bother people who are a bit larger, as there really is no room to turn around in there or anything, but I am understanding the hotel is also in the works of renovating a lot of their rooms, so I may have been in one that has not been completed yet. As part of the Hilton Honors program I had access to the executive level concierge and 'happy hours' if you have access to these do go, it was a great break in the day to enjoy some snacks and drinks in the middle of being touristy =) Check out was speedy as well, just dial a number and input your departure time and that's it. Nothing to sign or fill out, pretty convenient. Room service was very fast, and the food was good, however they do stop service at 10pm. We did request a bottle opener and plates/forks/knives a couple times and they were sent up within 5 minutes even after hours. I do know they have an AMAZING spa, but I unfortunately didn't get a chance to go =( The fitness center is pretty amazing too, however I don't believe it's free (which can be a turnoff, there are, however, trainers available all the time to help you with your workout, which can be a turn on) Overall I would recommend this hotel to just about anyone. If you're in CHicago on business it's definitely an amazing place to bring clients, very impressive. The downstairs bar and lounge always had well dressed people having drinks/apps. For families, it's very spacious (well except for the bathroom in my case) and the desk attendants were more than willing to help us find tours, book dinners, etc. Couples will enjoy the romantic ambiance and everyone should enjoy the central location. Both the red and blue line trains have stops within a block of the hotel and with entrances to all four streets surrounding there was NEVER a time where we couldnt catch a bus or train or cab.

Perhaps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start by mentioning Dardan Mehmeti, he went out of his way to ensure our stay was special. He is very dedicated to his job and a great person to deal with. Thank you Dardan! Aside from Dardan the entire staff really made sure to take good care of us during our stay. Not just the usual customer facing roles like concierge and check in, but the person who delivered our roll away bed even took the time to learn how to pronounce my last name (and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an easy one to pronounce). We arrived on a Friday night around 6 pm and only stood in line for check in for a minute or two. With regards to the hotel, this was more of a weekend away with some friends and not a business trip. The lobby is obviously breath taking and I highly recommend visiting making sure to have a drink or a coffee in the lobby. The coffee in the lobby is quite good (and I travel central America) and since there is no in room coffee machine it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great excuse to get down there. A lot of other reviews mentioned small rooms, we got a 2 bathroom 2 bedroom unit on the 15th floor. It was quite big but I realize it was probably an upgrade, we met some other people staying at the hotel and invited them up to our room. Their first reaction was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wow this room is big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A lot of other people complained about slow elevators. There are a few shafts serving different floors, but we never waited more than a minute or two. The actual room itself was well appointed in terms of linen. The room has a comfortable chair and two benches at the foot of a very comfortable bed. Cleaning staff always seem to come right as we slipped out for the day. The bathrooms in our 2 bathroom unit were sufficient and not as cramped as others have described. In room safe was also provided which is a bonus. The alarm clock supported aux input which is handy. My friend forgot a few toiletry items and requested a toothbrush. A ziplock bag full of supplies promptly arrived which had everything from a toothbrush to hairspray, definitely one of the best emergency toiletry kits I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a hotel provide. I was very satisfied with my stay but the only things that were missing were a flat screen TV and in room coffee. Not really a big deal since the coffee in the lobby was quite good and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up watching much TV. The room also had a surplus of a/c outlets. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how many hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to unplug a lamp in order to get access to two a/c outlets. Ice machine / pop machine on every floor, and one of the pop machines accepts MasterCard PayPass, perfect since I despise change and $1 bills. There is also a starbucks in the lobby which has free wifi. We ended up using the pool and hot tub daily, the pool isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t huge but enough to swim a couple of laps and the hot tub big enough to fit about 8 people. Towels are provided at the pool but it closes promptly at 9pm. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up using the fitness center but from what we could see through the window, it was pretty large (compared to other urban hotels) and had a number of flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I was very satisfied that the hotel had discounted self park. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a fan of waiting for a valet to retrieve and park my car, so it was nice saving a few bucks and parking myself, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also frustrating when hotels charge you the same for valet as for self park. You get in / out privileges and its $38 a day. The lot itself is on the next block, but once you exit the garage you just have to run across Wabash and the side door to the hotel is there (important in the winter/rain). The parking is supposed to be valid until 6pm the day of your departure. For some reason the lot tried to charge us $16 on departure despite the parking being billed to our room. I pressed the assistance button on the exit gate, and was told to go into the parking office. I showed my invoice from the hotel and they let me out free. So keep your departure invoice! The hotel is close to the loop but we never bothered taking the subway since taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were quite cheap (compared to Toronto). The area itself has a few decent restaurants. We were very happy with the meal at Ex-chequer apparently an Al Capone spot. Miller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pub was open a bit later on Sunday and the food was also good (had a great prime rib dinner). All within blocks from the hotel. Overall I am very satisfied with my stay at the Palmer house, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m curious what the executive floors have to offer so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably end up booking a room up there since I was so satisfied with my stay.

We usually stay at Kimpton properties while in Chicago - good rates, friendly staff, the wine hour. But we were going to Lollapalooza, which was only a couple of blocks up Monroe, and I got a decent rate on the Executive floor with self-park included. The hotel has been beautifully redone. The check-in was efficient and friendly. We got to our room - no mini bar. That drives me crazy, personally. Not that I ever use it, but we do like to stuff our leftovers in the fridge! I was not going to pay for a fridge to come to the room. Also - no free internet. I may be crazy, but as a silver HHonors member I believe I had free internet before. You can go to a Hampton and get it - why not the Palmer house? Ugh. The room was nice. Small, but nice. Bed was comfy, they usually are at Hilton properties. The bartender in the executive lounge had no clue on how to make a martini with a lemon twist - my husband ended up with a lime after she asked if he wanted olives. One evening we stopped at the lobby bar, Potter's, for drinks before going to bed, and the bartender had no idea what I was asking for - a wine that was on their somewhat limited by the glass list. I had to point it out. Also - for whatever reason they were not allowing carry out of food that evening. And they were a bit abrupt telling people about it. We had our drink and went upstairs where we had a bottle of wine waiting. When it was time to check out I called the bell desk to have them get our bags - we were going to do some shopping before leaving the city. I was asked (also abruptly) \"are you ready?\". NO. I always call the bell desk when I'm not ready. Then he went to the wrong room. He had to go back downstairs and find out where he was supposed to be going. When we came back for our bags I was told that I couldn't have them until my husband was in front of the hotel with the car. OK. So when he got there, there was a huge line. I finally got my turn, and the bellman who had my luggage moved so s-l-o-w-l-y that I almost grabbed the cart myself. Then he just stood there and let my husband load the car! Ugh.

Although I was there for a conference, my family was with me. The room was small and offered only two double beds. The bathroom was tiny, not even offering the rounded shower curtain rod to help the shower feel larger. For the conference, which was suppose to be a team building experience, the set up had the participants sitting classroom style, instead of with round tables, which would have made it more conducive for conversations with colleagues. For the conference luncheon we were jammed in a hallway with 8 people rounds, but they were set for 10 place settings. The wait staff were rude and rushed us out of there.

I called the front desk to see if there was a maintenance man available at this late hour (12:40am). She said yes and assured me he would be right up. I clearly asked, \"He will be up right away? If not, we can do this in the morning. It is late and I have children I would like to get to bed.\" She said yes. By 1:10am, I called back down and cancelled the maintenance man, stating it was too late and we could handle this in the morning. The front desk lady told me she could send up a fan, however I declined again stating it was too late. At 1:25am, the maintenance man came to our door - even after canceling the call. I begrudgingly let him in. He bumped the air controller down to 65, bent a couple of vent slats downward with a screwdriver, and claimed the fan was not on but it should be fixed now. The room continued to feel warm even with the air set at 65 for the 2 days my family and I stayed. Our final night here, I returned from a baseball game and went to the lobby bar/restaurant for a late meal. The bartender stated the kitchen was open until midnight, so I still had about half an hour. I contacted a server, and stated that I wanted to order food to take back up to my room. He told me to go up to the room and call down the order and it would be brought up to me. I explained that my employer would not reimburse extra fees, and that I just wanted to order a sandwich and bring it up. He again stated to order from the room and there would be no extra charges. I went back upstairs to my room and called down. The person taking the order now stated that there would be a 18% gratuity, a 3% service fee, and a $2.00 delivery charge on the order!!! I went back downstairs with the in room menu that also stated these charges and showed it to the server. He did not really say much, but acknowledged the charges. When I tried again to order, he said he would have to check to see if the cook was still available. It was now 11:50pm. He and another server came out and said that food was no longer available for the night.

The pros: historic, beautiful grand lobby, appreciate the original charm, Starbucks (which never had a line when I was there), easy to walk to food / attractions, nice bellman The cons: The place is massive and somewhat difficult to navigate, the original charm stops at the elevators and windows, for goodness sake, get some better windows to drown out the city noise. I would probably give this place 5 stars if it had not been for our first night. We were placed in a room near the elevators and at first we laughed about it, thought we'd either get used to the noise, or the elevators would stop running so much during the night. Mistake! Those things banged and knocked ALL NIGHT LONG! Just as you were lulling off to sleep, WHIIRRRRR, BANG, CLANG. At 3:00 we were so sleep deprived, we called down and asked to change rooms, were told they were full, and they would send the maintenance man up to check the noise (which they later said the maintenance man didn't hear anything....?????) The next day they changed us to a room which was actually larger, nicer, and quiet. I can get over the sorta ugly carpet and skeevy old chairs, but I can't handle not sleeping, so those rooms should come with a warning and you should get a substantial discount to stay in the noisy rooms, we got neither, not even a 'We're so sorry' from the front desk staff.

On Saturday afternoon at Lockwood, the long bar in the lobby, pooped tourists in flip-flops poured down beer and lemonade passed across the cool marble by impeccable bartenders. In New York or Paris there might be some quacking about a dress code. Here, somehow, among the overstuffed leather furniture and the painted, brass and woven peacocks that comprise the Palmer's motif, it all works: relaxed, tolerant, and endlessly friendly. Our room was big and beautifully appointed with numerous updates, including new luxe bathroom fixtures and strong water pressure (often a concern in older properties) and unstoppable AC.

This is the first time I have awarded a hotel 1-star in one of my reviews and I don't mean to suggest that this is a one-star hotel but rather that we had a terrible experience. I always have read one-star TA reviews with a bit of skepticism that the reviewers were just malcontents, I hope this is not taken the same way. Friends from Chile were traveling to the U.S. and booked a room a month in advance at the Palmer House for their Chicago leg. Their credit card was charged for the room. Three days before they were to arrive in Chicago from Wisconsin, our friends received an e-mail that the hotel was not able to verify the foreign address on their credit card and therefore canceled the reservation three days before their arrival. This although the credit card had already been charged for the room. We called the hotel to straighten out the problem but were told there were no rooms available now and that they were unable to do anything about it except refund the amount already charged. The only room our friends could find in downtown Chicago on three days notice was a run-down Travel Lodge -- a far cry from a hotel like the Palmer House. There were so many better ways for the Palmer House to handle the situation and they should be ashamed for their complete lack of customer service. As a Chicagoan, I am embarrassed as this reflects poorly on the city (country?) as a whole to a foreign visitor. Shame on Palmer House for not taking responsibility! As a side note, I looked through other TA reviews of the hotel for similar problems and noticed that although there were numerous one- and two-star reviews, there was no response from management on any that I saw (perhaps there are responses to some I did not read?). On the other hand, for a number of the five-star reviews, Palmer House management responded, thanking the reviewers for their comments. As manager of a large hotel, wouldn't you be more interested in addressing poor experiences guests have had rather than thanking happy guests?

I inquired as to the availability of the Empire Room for our exact anniversary date, June 23rd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Thursday.

I suggested my idea to Jane that my wife and I have dinner for 2 in the Empire Room on the night of our anniversary, just as we celebrated our wedding there 10 years ago to the hour. This is when Jane and her team took over. To my surprise and excitement, Jane took this idea from the start and worked very hard to make this idea, this dream, become a reality. I worked with Jane over the next couple of weeks and days leading up to our night. She helped me pull off one of the greatest nights and best memories my wife and I will ever share.

From what I could tell there is only one ice machine on each floor. I saw that another review mentioned free WI-FI, but its not free, you have to pay for it. I loved the overall 'historical' ambience of the Palmer house. Concierge was nothing but helpful, and friendly, even printing out a map for me. I would highly recommend asking concierge for the guide book called 'Concierge preferred, Chicago Icons' just for the maps on the inside alone. Also has good info on where to eat, and shop and what not. We used a 3 day transport pass for our four days in Chicago, which was great! Right outside the hotel there are stops for the red-line subway as well as the blue-line. Easy walking distance to many clothing stores, restaurants, and Millennium park.

The location can't be beat (especially for my visit). Every member of staff I interacted with was friendly (though a note on this below). Outweighed, unfortunately, by the bad. The room was worn to a shocking degree. Peeling wallpaper, insects in the bathroom, a very worn and stained carpet, stained floor in the bathroom and cracking grout, peeling paint and a door nob about to fall out in the bathroom. I found the bed linens to be scratchy--something I've never run into in a Hilton--though some of that could be psychosomatic. The room felt dirty, not helped by two long dark hairs left on the fresh towels. I got to be serenaded by the couple in the room next to me when it was time to sleep; the walls were paper thin. As I said, folks were friendly. I was a bit surprised that they had two people working the line for check in. One trying (awkwardly) to make conversation, the other with cold water (a very nice touch on a hot day). Had they trained one of these people to help with check-ins, though, we wouldn't have had as long a wait. As it was, the check-in process was slower than it needed to be, even after I got to the counter. I chose the hotel based in large part on the positive reviews here on Tripadvisor, and on the location. I had been here for a conference a few years back and been unimpressed by the meeting rooms, but figured I'd give it another chance based on the generally good reviews here. I suspect that had I gotten one of the renovated rooms (I was on the 21st floor), I would have had a much better experience. I've lived in NYC and Tokyo, small doesn't bother me. I guess I could have requested being moved, but I was exhausted and had no way of knowing if this was actually the standard of the hotel. I guess the take-away is that Chicago has a lot of very nice hotels, and hotels that cost less and provide a nicer stay.

Cons- When I checked in the representative did not slide my credit card correctly, so the payment never went through. He gave us our keys so I obviously assumed that everything was fine. On our second day there, our keys stopped working so we went to the front desk and they just made us new keys. They didn't mention anything about us paying. On the morning were were checking out at 8:30am a security guard showed up at our door saying we needed to go downstairs to the front desk. We called at first and discovered that they said we never paid and had to come down immediately and pay. We asked if we could just wait until we checked out (only a couple hours away) but they refused. So we went down to the lobby, obviously very irritated and upset. They said that my card was not swiped right when we checked in so it showed that we never paid. We found out that the reason what our keys did not work the day before was because they had locked our room but the person we talked to failed to inform us of that. The manager acted as though it was our fault that her employee didn't check us in right. She had the nerve to tell me that she was not putting us out at all by this. My response was that I was in her lobby at 8:30am in my pjs! I did end up getting a partial credit, but it was not worth the bad experience. I understand that computer issues happen, but the way they handled the situation was extremely poor. Sending a security guard to my room for their mistake is unacceptable and very poor customer service.

I traveled with two of my friends for a girls trip. We arrived on 6/29/2011 and checked out 7/3/2011. The pros: - GREAT location - Beautiful lobby and historic hotel -geared toward the business/executive traveler -friendly staff -very clean & comfortable The cons: -pricey if you want Executive level service -no free wi-fi -slow elevators -thin walls -expensive to park Check in- The hotel let us check in early to our room with no extra charge. Upon arrival everyone was super friendly and so willing to help. In addition to the check-in/reservations desk, there is a concierge as well as a transportation desk. Lobby & Common area- The lobby is simply breathtaking. It's easy to imagine yourself transported back to the roaring 20s surrounded by flappers and mobsters. Lauren, the assistant manager at the restaurant, showed us around the Empire Room, where everyone from Frank Sinatra to Liberace has performed. You MUST go see it. Also, don't miss the Red Lacquer room on the 4th floor. It was a favorite of Al Capone and is in my opinion the most beautiful place in the hotel. Take some time to explore and look at all of the black and white photos hanging in the halls. It's worth your time if you're a history buff like me. Room- We booked via Priceline and received a great rate (under $100/night) so we expected to get the lower quality rooms in the hotel rather than the executive level. We had a non-smoking double bed room. The room is small, but not unbearable. I would compare it to a Holiday Inn or the like. The bathroom is definitely not spacious, but was perfect for what we needed. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the showers were hot. What more can you ask for when you pay a rate like we did? One caution though- the walls are REALLY thin, which is to be expected in an older hotel. The Staff- The staff here was great. Everyone was ridiculously friendly and helpful, from the concierge to the maids. No complaints here. Location- You couldn't ask for a better location. You are about 3 blocks from Millenium Park, 8 blocks from the Sears (Willis) Tower, just south of Michigan Avenue shopping, and are right in the middle of everything.

There is old-world luxury everywhere - certainly the mural on the lobby ceiling, but in many other details, as well. Don't pass it by too quickly - look for artwork everywhere, and elegant details in every things from lamps to furniture. The early check-in went great - thanks to Jurgita at the front desk. We had three adjacent connecting rooms on the executive level. I don't think I've ever seen 3 connecting rooms before - perfect for a group of 3 couples. The executive level is well worth the extra money. A private elevator to the top 2 floors is a nice treat! Plus a huge lounge, which was a great place just to hang out in between sight seeing. One of the lounge hosts, Ernest, was incredible. In addition to making us feel welcome and taking care of all our food and beverage needs, he's a wealth of knowledge about the area. The included breakfast was typical continental, but certainly adequate. The evening snacks could have been a full meal - two hot choices every night, plus fruit, veggies, cheese & crackers, etc. And the world-famous Palmer House brownies were available all day! As was fresh, hot coffee! The location is perfect. Just steps from the Orange Line train from Midway Airport. Millennium Park and Grant Park are only a block away. Buses run frequently right in front of the hotel to take you wherever you want to go - Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Museums. And a 3 day day transit pass is only $14! No need for a car here.

We booked the room through Priceline for $80 per night. The total, including tax, for our four-night stay was $380. (Yes, this was a very good deal.) The big advantages to the hotel are (1) its location, (2) its historical value. On the first point, the Palmer House is a quick walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park and only a slightly longer walk to Michigan Ave and the great shopping. On the second point, it's a historic building, and the lobby and decor are really fun and charming. You can tell people you meet in Chicago that you are staying at the \"Palmer\" and they'll know what you're talking about. The big drawbacks: First, the hotel is huge but the rooms are small (like, New York City small). Tiny, stuffy, cramped...there's not much room for two people to move around comfortably. Second, you have to pay for things that should really be included -- specifically WiFi and the fitness center. (The fitness center, if you go, is actually really nice...but they charge $10 each visit.) Third, I pity the fool who tries to stay at this hotel while there's a large conference going on. We were part of such a large conference and, needless to say, attendees for our conference were everywhere and took up all the free space in the lobby and the elevators were mobbed. I felt badly for the poor tourists trying to get around. Overall, it's a nice hotel and a great catch on Priceline if you can get it.

She's played hostess to presidents and the well off and beautiful. She's earned her place in the sun. Still, like many of her kind, the years haven't necessarily been kind. While glimpses of her former beauty and personality still shine through, her features have slackened and become somewhat unrecognizable through the years. Her main lobby, complete with dramatic staircases, more often resembles the chaotic terminal of an airport, than an elegant and serene foyer in which to relax with a pot of afternoon tea and pastries. In the three days I was in residence there, there was virtually no time - save very late in the evening - when this lovely area wasn't besieged with families of travelers and their resulting luggage. It seems as though the hotel might choose to find another location that their arriving and departing guests might lounge with suitcases, rather than the elegant, main lobby/tea room. The rooms, (at least our room was), in good repair, clean, and reasonably attractively furnished. The view wasn't outstanding, but I rarely blame an urban hotel for that. Everyone can't have the best view, and that is an acceptable point. The bathroom, while clean and adequately furnished, was very small. Subsequently, it was very crowded for my my own, as well as my husband's, toiletries to fit on the small shelf over the sink. The shower was fine. This was not a four or five star hotel in my opinion, but likewise, we didn't pay four or five star prices, either. The interior hallways leading to the bedrooms need a little attention. The wallpaper is peeling in places, and lends a dingy feel of neglected grandeur. Room service was delivered on more than one occasion, and the hotel was notably quick with their delivery - both times in less than half an hour. The restaurant, as well as the more casual bar, were both very pleasant experiences. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning. The buffet was more than adequate, but in addition to this - any person paying for the buffet had the opportunity to order off the menu as well at no additional charge. For example, if a person would prefer an omelette or Eggs Benedict rather than the scrambled eggs offered in the buffet line, this option was readily made possible for the guest. I travel frequently, and I'm not aware of any other hotels with this nice offer. Dinner in the same restaurant was fine also, but not inexpensive. We tried a pre-fix menu of three courses paired with three different beers. It was an interesting concept, but the dinner wasn't anything especially noteworthy. The location was convenient to most major attractions, and of course that is a huge boon for those vacationers interested in seeing the sights in and around the downtown area.

Most often I utilized Priceline and other on-line services because I am an seasoned bargain hunter. One cannot imagine a more grand lobby, which harkens back to the days when craftsmanship and style were appreciated. The rooms have indeed varied in size as pointed out by many reviewers. However, I won a Mother's Day prize from this hotel and took my Mom for an overnight. What a tremendous experience, filled with delightful surprises from start to finish! Dianna Freiss made the arrangements for us, and even after some changes from my Mom Dianna remained the ultimate gracious professional. The lobby, always a selling point before, was taken in methodically during our afternoon tea. That is the perfect time to study the architectural details which put a smile on my face. Each time I looked up I saw something new, or at least saw it in a better light. Our waiter was cordial and charming, and offered my Mom some champagne. The champagne was at the level one should expect from a luxury hotel, and Mom's cheeks were pink from either the alcohol or the smiles. The service was precise, the offerings for tea featured some brands I have not seen in my travels (order the citrus tea and your eyes will roll back in your head), and the selection of sandwiches and sweets was well balanced. We were offered a room on the Executive Level and having experienced the difference I will not waste quality time haggling over a few dollars on the internet ever again. Two full beds featured triple sheets and down comforters with emblematic French tapestry reflecting the other French accoutrements of the room. Mama bowed out of plans to tour the Art Institute because she realized how this special upgrade was to be savored. We each relaxed in separate full baths until it was time for hors d'oevres and conversation one floor above ours. Both of us are people watchers, and were fascinated with the myriad languages we heard and the stories we designed in our fantasy world. Although the small tables were all taken when we arrived, by the time we made our way through the buffet seats were available. We easily struck up conversations with other women travelers who elicited advice on sites in downtown Chicago that should not be missed. It felt like a lovely cocktail party and we stayed for at least an hour. Returning to the room, I noticed the added level of security for the Executive Level: a separate elevator that required a room key to operate. I consider this an important feature for females traveling solo. Naturally, Mom was impressed with the inroom safe for the same reason. Back to the room: each of us had a separate closet in addition to the abundance of drawers in the TV armoire. There was also a comfy chair and what appeared to be a pull-out sofa in front of the wide screen TV. The desk was equipped with wifi options and electrical outlets were plentiful: perfect for a business traveler or a long term stay. I will return with my hubby when he can free himself up from work. It will be such a treat for us! It was also a comfort to note many security guards who were very attentive. Indeed, I spoke with Dave and told him I might apply for a part-time position undercover!

We actually stayed in one room (the 6 of us) because we were trying to save money. We got a decent price on the hotel through some connections of friends of friends but we weren't really impressed with the decor, amenities, and other things that were in the room. The second night was interesting since we got up early to be one of the few to get into the pool and hot tub area. The pool was suppose to be heated (it wasn't as heated in the morning as it should be) and we had to call a member of the staff to warm up the hot tub since it wasn't even luke warm. Considering a hotel of that size (over 100 rooms) only had ONE pool and ONE hot tub with a maximum of amount of people allowed in the pool and hot tub area at a time you would think they would have more than just one of each kind of amenity. Also there wasn't any one to enforce the rule of 8 people at a time in the hot tub. At one point there was 10-12 people in it. The staff was friendly enough but not extremely great. We had to ask for extra bedding to accomodate the people that were going to be sleeping on the floor. We thought we were going to get a room that was going to be big enough to accomodate everyone like a suite that offered a couch of some sort. But it was a standard two \"double\" sized beds. The room itself was equipped with two closets and two bathrooms which was nice to have. It would have been nice to actually have been shown the room before checking in. We waited awhile in line when checking in at 6 pm. I actually work for a hotel but not of this calibur so I can understand the reason for waiting that long. We got lost a few times but eventually found our way to the hotel and to the self parking that was cheaper than getting the valet parking. The hotel didn't have many resurants near them or any information on what to find around the area. But not having free internet in the room was kind of disappointing. The trip itself was fun since I was with friends but we pretty much went with the flow. Definately ask for one of the more renavated rooms if you expect a more positive stay. Over all I am honestly not impressed. The decor in the lobby should reflect something of what the rooms look like.

The food at the lobby was very good with typical hotel prices and the service was excellent. we had breakfast at the Lockwood one morning. we ordered from the menu and did not do the buffet.

The rate was significantly higher than I've paid at other convention hotels recently. But the big problem was with the quality of the hotel services relative to the $$$ charged. The first room we were in did not have internet. It had an ethernet wire on the top of the desk--right next to a telephone instrument. But neither one plugged into the wall. There was no place to plug them in anywhere in the room. They were just completely phony decorations. I complained and we were relocated to an equivalent room that did have working connections and given a check to use at one of the (overpriced) Hotel restaurants. But that should never have happened at a hotel like this. All the furnishings in the room were tired and sagging. A bench at the end of the bed wobbled crazily--it needed to have somebody tighten some nuts in the frame. I mentioned that to a guy delivering food to the room, and his reaction was \"hey, not my job!\" There was no coffee-maker in the room and of course no refrigerator (not even a mini-bar) or microwave. Somewhere on the sprawling floor there was probably an ice machine, but I never saw it. One day I tried to use the little safe and at the end of the day, it refused to open for me. They security guy who came promptly to open it laughed and said \"this happens all the time.\" The bathroom shower was supposed to have a pull cord that you could use to hang up washables, but it was broken. The toilet paper was mounted in an almost unreachable position behind your left shoulder-blade. There was only one suitcase stand. Don't most couples have two suitcases? Where is the other one supposed to go? The lamp frames were bent and the effect was that the place looked sort of crazy. There was no guide to the TV channels to tell you what content was on which channel. It was not all bad: good points: the room was bigger than average; there were plenty of towels that were pretty good quality; there was a sufficient number of good-quality hangers. The individual employees we dealt with were pleasant and seemed competent in their jobs. The bed was fine (that's important!), and the street noise was not too bad.

I had a good rate so maybe my expectations weren't as high as they would have been had I paid over $200 (the quoted rate for that weekend). As everybody else has said this lobby is gorgeous. We sat in the lobby a couple of nights for drinks. It was crowded and the waiter came over to take our drink order. I asked for a Martini menu and he said, \"We don't have one.\" I found out the next day, indeed they did and was given the menu. No big deal, just that he didn't want to be bothered and knew he'd have plenty of drink orders since it was crowded. Check in was quick, with not many people in line. I asked for a room with 2 beds and that was no problem. I got to the room and it was a nice size with a nice bathroom. It had been recently redecorated/remodeled. It had a very European feel. Doorknobs were antique and the furniture art-deco. Televisions are not flat screen, but that didn't bother us. Internet was listed @ $15 per day. Gym cost $10 pp per day. We used the swimming pool and hot tub on the 8th floor. They were just o.k. The hot tub was really old and not very clean, This area needs some serious updating! The first night (Friday) there were people in the next room partying and LOUD. You could hear exactly what they were saying:( We thought it would stop but it didn't . I called downstairs and they said they call them and take care of it. NOT. I banged on the wall, they banged back but it stopped. (12:30 a.m.) The last night Sunday night, around 11p.m,. someone in the hall was banging loudly on a door across the hall from our room. It went on for nearly an hour. My daughter opened our door and a lady said, \"Sorry, my daughter has locked us out\" After nearly another half hour, I got up and went to check and there were two security officers unscrewing the safety lock to access the room!!! Once they got in, they left pretty quickly so I supposed nothing concerned them. It did however concern our night's sleep. This whole scene should have been handled differently. Two of three nights sleep disturbed:( I ordered room service for breakfast and it was wonderful: food, service and price! The location of Palmer House is excellent. One block to the Art Institute, walking distance to Macy's, and lots of shopping. I did take a cab to the shopping areas near the central part of Michigan Ave (Magnificent Mile) Only $5. The bus system looked easy and safe. Next time I'll use it. I did take the El Orange Line from Midway and was surprised at how easy, safe, and clean it was. Cost was $ 2.25 and dropped me right at the door of Palmer House. Used it going back too. It took about 25 minutes which was probably faster than a cab. People everywhere were so helpful and friendly all over Chicago. One of the highlights was Garrett's popcorn!!! YUM!!! We ate at Miller's Pub, Beef and Burgundy, and Gage. All these are less than a block from the hotel. I'd stay here again IF I got a cheap rate.

So if you get your room cheap - which means under $130 a night you might want to stay here. Otherwise you will not get what you pay for. First impression, 18 minutes in the Hilton Honors line to check in at 8PM on a Saturday night. Imagine what it is like on Monday. First room 12X15 and this is in an upgraded room I measured. The others are smaller. No toilet paper, no tissues, all of the lamps unplugged, pealing wall paper and pealing plaster in the spaces between the wall paper. Then the pipes began to scream and bang. Called the desk asked to send up an engineer they sent a security guard for the screaming. Explained the issue called the desk, they said there was no problem. Started again 30 minutes later so I held up the phone this time and they said they could hear it through the phone but would send a plumber. He came said of course he knew it happened it was old pipes. Called the desk a fourth time put him on and they said the onl king room was on the executive floor but I would have to pay for. I said fine. Went to put my suit in the closet. This is not a lie the closet was narrower than my coat hanger. Then went to use the TV. Did not work they sent a repair person. Then went to use the wireless. They said you need to come down to the front desk - waited 15 minutes - to get an old bridge, leave a $200 deposit, went back plugged it in nothing. Wireless only works with a bridge, get one when you check in. Called down the sixth time in 12 hours and they did not have any engineers working Sunday sent a bellman with a new bridge. The internet did not work in the room because the plug was torn out from the wall. Called down a 7th time in 12.5 hours and they said they would find me another king. They would find me a work room in the mean time. Sent a bellman he told me he was there to move me to a single - the old 12X16. I said no. I took the key went here and now am online and decided to write. Can't wait for the next 3.5 days. Check your room before you agree to make sure it is OK. BTW when I complained around call number 5 the desk person said they were sorry they did not know how the hotel had 4 stars when the Hampton Inn around the corner was better set up with better rooms and services.

Upon my departure, I was loaded with luggage and the bellman never offered to assist me or even open the door!!! I have no idea why the Palmer House have bellmen...they certainly provided no service!! Also, as a side note--this hotel was recently on the news for having bed bugs!!

Top Notch. The Lobby is truly beautiful. A Chicago Landmark. I live in Chicago & was excited to stay at the Palmer House for my birthday & I love Hilton Hotels. I booked a King from AA vacations with my miles stating that I only wanted a King or Queen. At check in we were told our room was a double. 2 people in a double..Ouch. Well, I'm pretty easy going, gladly took my key & went to my room. So sad, the bed was so tiny and the room was the size of a closet size coffin with the bleak view of a inner courtyard. I have stayed in Hiltons across the world & really love the touches they add to their rooms. However, this was not the case at the Palmer House. Honestly, I would say you could do better at the Holiday Inn. Not only was the room tiny, we could hear our neighbors discussion about how their dresses didn't fit & people in the hall casually walking by. It felt like the walls were paper thin & we were sleeping in the hallway. Besides that the heating system was as loud as a small helicopter. I'm all for vintage charm( my house is over 100 yrs old) & truly not a high maintenance person but this was really crappy. We went to an art exhibit down the street, hoping when we got back, somehow are room would grow on us. It didn't, it was throughly depressing. We checked out, after 2 hours. The front desk was surprised and offered us another room with 2 Double beds. We declined. It was a nice suggestion but really, the idea of sleeping ala Lucy & Desi was not appealing. Let it be known..2 People really don't fit on a double bed..2 double beds really doesn't solve the problem for a couple. We left & chalked this up to a bad weekend. Went home, had pizza & slept in our own queen size bed. The bad part about all this is A) I will never have another 40th bday. B) Iost about 11,000 miles on a room I didn't want or stay in. C) No apology from management or staff. That's downright crappy.

He gave me the room number and said to get a key from the front desk or meet him up at the room. Unfortunately, the nice, polite and respectful gentleman who had previously been assisting me was assisting another customer, so another agent named Suri called me over to see what she could help me with. She explained that I could not have a key to the room as that was the hotel policy, which I was fine with. I was not trying to change anyone's policy. So I politely asked how to get to the room number my husband had given me. She said that she would not give me that information. That I would just have to wait standing there in the lobby until my husband was able to come \"pick me up\". She then called the next customer, so I guess she had had enough of trying to assist me. To be honest the entire exchange with her was terrible and not to the standards that I would hold a hotel with such a great reputation as The Palmer House.I walked over to stand out of the way. Very hurt and upset for being treated so rudely, once my husband arrived and found me standing there visibly upset he wanted to know what could have happened. So I explained the whole story. He was so livid that I had been treated so badly that he walked straight over and asked for the manager. So after a few minutes the manager emerged and stated that she had already been informed by Suri exactly what had happened. After another very rude and disappointing conversation with the manager my husband and I went to our room, but as we entered the room we decided that spending our Valentine's Day evening at a hotel that really didn't care whether or not their patrons were happy or treated respectfully we would just go elsewhere.

Great bar to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. We spent hours grabbing a drink and walking around. I noticed some reviews complaining about prices at the lobby bar. Its Chicago! Drinks are going to be more expensive anywhere you go. A martini is $12.00 and beer is $6.00. Not bad for the atmosphere you are drinking in. -Location / Parking- It was nice to have a safe affordable self parking option right across the street. My wife and I walked from the hotel down Mich Ave and back. -Executive Floor- Its definately worth the minor upgrade to the executive level floors. Happy hour is a blast with great drinks and food all covered in the room cost. Also breakfast in the morning is wonderful. Plus private elevators (with benches) are a nice benefit. BAD - Check in- Now i am sure it depends on who you are dealing with. But the person helping us had a lousy attitude. Our room \"package\" came with a free breakfast, but he argued with me about it even though I had the paperwork to prove it. After dealing with the manager we recieved a free breakfast. Why offer the free breakfast deal if the staff doesnt know about it? Dont let this sway your desicion to stay here - Room smell- Our room smelled like bubble gum times 10000. Im sure it was a air sanitizer but it made our stomaches turn. Why anyone would spray that much of anything in a room i dont know. We didnt complain, just opened the window for 5 hours while we were at dinner. Still an executive level room shouldnt have this problem. - Room in general- I was disappointed with the room size and ammenities. For an executive level room, it was small and slightly dated. Very clean and bed was comfortable. But the more modern chicago hotels have much better rooms. OVERALL- The reason to stay in this hotel is the lobby and history. Its truly remarkable. If you want a modern luxury hotel with large modern rooms then stay at the Trump. This hotel has a great \"old chicago\" feel. You will feel like VIP's while walking around the lobby, lounge, restaurant, or just the hallways. Its worth a stay at least once. You wont regret trying it out. I dont think its for everyone.

There was no coffee maker, but they are available upon request. The room safe was big enough for the largest of computers. There are very nice amenities in the bathroom. Water pressure was perfect and the water was hot. The downside of this hotel is the extra charge situation. Everything costs extra. There is no mini-bar because they want you to order from room service. Coffee is $8 plus $2 delivery charge and 21% service charge, plus tax. The gym is $10, internet starts at $14.99 for a few hours and $19.99 for a day. A scotch in the bar was $17 with tax and tip. There are plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood like Au Bon Pain which has a great lunch. You can watch your favorite TV show if you missed its initial run for $4.99 and movies are available at a much higher cost. I highly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful old hotel, just watch your wallet!", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor Canada", "Title": "\u201cAn incredible hotel.\u201d", "Author": "LauraHasulo", "ReviewID": "UR95947619", "Content": "The Palmer House is a beautiful hotel.

The 'el' was so close to the hotel, you can hear it. It's fine once you get used to it, but needs a little adjustment before you do. Our room was lovely, mainly I think because we had a corner room which made it light and airy, with a view down to the lake. Also, because we had two beds, whihc meant it was reasonably sized. We heard a lady in the elevator complaining about the size of here room and when we went past a room beign serived and could see inside it, it did seem quite small. The bathroom was good with great products, the bedding was lovely and the location was fabulous. Most things were well within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat close by, so no need to starve here. Our complaints were around the lack of... no kettle for tea or coffee making in the room. Why? And wifi was available, but at the most rediculous prices! It was something like \u00c2\u00a314.99 for basic (good enough to check your emails) a DAY or \u00c2\u00a319.99 for the faster stuff. As my cousin said - how come most of the coffee shops provide free access while you sip your $2 coffee, yet hotels charging huge amounts of money can't offer the same service? I'd advise you to go for a coffee to check your emails! Our other complaint was about the pool area. the pool is TINY, no changing facilities and the jaccussi was out of order for our whole trip, which was rubbish. We were really looking forward to a nice soak after a lot of walking and were hugely disappointed that it wasn't in working order. That aside though, we had a nice visit. The hotel lobby is as amazing as everyone says - but all manner of people can wander in and out of the area unchallenged, so make sure you lock everything up okay. We recomend the gage, which is on Michigan Avenue for a lovely meal.

One room was a double and was very large \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plenty of room to spread out with a large walk in closet and decent size bathroom. The King room was a bit smaller, but completely adequate. In both rooms, it looked as if the bathroom had recently been freshened up with new paint, wall paper, vanity and sink. The tub was a little tired but clean and I like the vintage look of an older hotel. The hallways are decorated with pictures of all the celebrities that appeared in the Empire Room. It was fun to see all the people that performed there from the 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to the 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We were able to walk into the Empire Room as there were no events scheduled.

The fitness center is very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots of cardio machines, weight machines, plus free weights, exercise balls, and mats. It cost $10 per day, less if you have status with Hilton.

The Hilton-Palmer House is a very historic building, originally built in 1871 and rebuilt after the Chicago fire of the same year in 1875. There were additions in the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. So, while the hotel lobby is extremely palatial (reminded me of the main room in Grand Central Sta.), the hotel room I had left LOTS to be desired. As a Hilton Honors member, I called a few days before arriving to ensure that a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker were part of the room amenities. I was assured that they were. Unfortunately, upon arriving in my room, nothing I was promised was there. The Hotel said that they would provide these amenities; however, there would be a daily charge for them. After arguing with the desk clerk that a Hilton hotel ought to have such items, the hotel DID finally comp. me for these amenities, however, there was not a lot of space in my hotel room for them. The king bed and side desk took up almost the entire space. And, the bathroom, as others have complained, had no shelf, other than what little space was on the counter where the modern bowl sink was. For anyone with lots of toiletries, you were out of luck for shelf space. The clothes closet reminded me of my parents 1900\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s built house with small 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122X5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 closets, again VERY small space. And the room thermometer apparently worked when it wanted to. When I arrived, the room temperature was 72 degrees and the thermostat set to 65 degrees. In order for room temperature to be reduced, I had to open the window, wide, so that the room temperature was more closely related to the thermostat setting. I had latter set the thermostat to 60 degrees to reduce the heat in the room. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Heck of a way to heat/cool the room. The only chair in the room was a desk chair. Spending two weeks in this hotel, it would have been much more comfortable to have some sort of upholstered chair with an ottoman. Course; there was no space for a chair like that in this room either. My Gov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laptop has so much security on it, it would not work in my hotel room. However, if I had wanted to use a computer in my room, the charge would have been $15/day. This really highlights this hotel, they charged for EVERYTHING. If I was spending my own money, I would have stayed at some other hotel, this is an embarrassment for the Hilton chain of hotels.

It was a belated birthday trip for my gf (and a sneaky engagement plan....she said yes). The Palmer House Hilton was a pleasant surprise. First off that lobby area is immaculate. It's a beautiful lobby area, very classy & upscale. My girlfriend immediately thought I'd laid out big bucks for our weekend stay. Check in was fine. There was a short line, but it moved quickly and our desk clerk was very courteous and we had keys in hand promptly and were off to our room. Also, the baggage check was free after our checkout and we didn't leave until late in the evening (we did tip though). Now we did have one of the smaller rooms, which was a slight disappointment. The setup and decor were excellent. But initially I felt a tad uncomfortable with the lack of open space. I got used to it by the 2nd day, but it's by far the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in. That said, I didn't have to climb over the bed or squeeze in between anything. There's just enough space to do what you need to do. Not much extra. I must say though, the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. I slept very well. The view from the room was not much to see. All we really could see was the fire-escape. But that wasn't an issue as we spent most of our time there out & about exploring the city. Location was excellent. It's right in the mix of the city. Millennium Park was only a few blocks away and we generally just walked when going to the Taste. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but walked next door (literally) to Miller's Pub for dinner the night of our arrival. The next morning, we walked less than a block for breakfast (can't remember the name of the place). There were tons of stores & restaurants within a few blocks. A few things to note: parking is very high. I knew this beforehand & chose to fly instead of driving. Mass transit in Chicago is wonderful anyway. Bus or subway will get you anywhere - quickly. Second: the pool costs $$$. But we didn't really have a desire to swim at all during our trip, so didn't affect us. Third: no free wifi. Overall, it's a great place to stay, especially if you find a decent rate like I did. I'd definitely stay there again if I visit Chitown and just cross my fingers that I get one of the larger rooms.

The only real complaint that I had was that the walls are quite thin. Bring ear plugs as you will definitely need them. The hotel also allows animals, which I simply do not understand. We had two small dogs next door and with the thin walls, it actually sounded as if the animals were in the same room with us. I kept expecting one of the little butt sniffing creatures to poke his nose between my cheeks. Why dog people think everyone is a dog lover, I don't know. At any rate, I did my best impersonation of the witch in the Wizard of Oz (\"I'll get you...and your little dog too\"). The thin walls actually helped as the creatures shut up for the rest of the night. Beds are quite comfortable. The room comes with a safe, which is always a nice feature.

I wasn't surprised when I had difficulty calling the front desk before my arrival to make sure I had the kind of room I wanted. When I stayed on hold for twenty minutes, I looked at tripadvisor reviews and began to worry because there were a few negative reviews. My experience at the hotel, however, demonstrated that there was no foundation in fact for my worries. The hotel exceeded all my expectations. Tatyana at reception listened to all my needs and fulfilled them. I have arthritis and need a large tub in which to soak. I also had three bags and needed adequate closet space. She showed me plans of the rooms and selected one that met my needs. To my surprise without my asking she upgraded me to the executive floor thanks to my Hilton Honors status and discouraged me from selecting a room that had the potential to be noisy because of its location. As I walked through the lobby and looked at the ceiling, I wondered whether Michelangelo or one of his students had painted the ceiling. The lobby itself deserved an hour's tour. The elevator to the executive floors was fast and had a seat! When I arrived in my room, I called for my bags, and within two minutes, Lindell, the bellman brought them to me and welcomed me to this historic hotel by sharing a little of its history. My room was large and immaculately clean. The furniture was in brand new condition though it made me feel that Teddy Roosevelt was going to walk through my door. The bed coverings, upholstery, and carpet might have been the same ones he used in 1901 though they looked brand new. Only the modern television brought me back from my time warp into the 21st Century. A lady from housekeeping told me more about the hotel and welcomed me again and gave me excellent directions. Later I spokewith Ladelle Crawford, who had worked for housekeeping for 14 years. She was as dedicated and knowledgeable as the others whom I encountered. She explained the red and blue line trains, which are both near the hotel entrance. Her information was correct and helpful. Last month when I stayed at another hotel, the concierge gave me the wrong information and added an hour to my trip. Ladelle was better than her competitor's concierge. To be sure, the bathroom was small, but it was clean and adequate. The tub was large and deep. The water was hot and had good pressure. The toilet was next to the tub and near the sink. The size of the bathroom didn't bother me as much as the quality of the cosmetics, which were barely adequate. Soap, shampoo, body wash, and conditioner reminded me of Ivory Soap and didn't compare with the cosmetics at higher level Hilton's such as the Waldorf=Astoria and the Roosevelt in New Orleans. The service at the Palmer House, however, was at least as good as that at the Waldorf=Astoria, and each employee I met acted as if he or she owned the hotel and truly cared about my experience.

However, annoying service issues and average furnishings detracted from the stay. First, the service issues. I waited 25 minutes to check in, and I was lucky. The line was twice as long when I finished. They were grossly understaffed on a very busy night - an inexcusable way for a guest to start their stay. The elevators on my wing were unreliable, and I got stuck for 10 minutes one evening. On the way out, I waited 10 minutes for what apparently was the sole functioning elevator to arrive on my floor. My room (a suite) was spacious and well-appointed, but the furnishings were somewhat dated, including TVs that must be 8-10 years old. I was alone, which was fortunate, because the bath was tiny.

It's a wonderful experience in a grand institution of Chicago. When you're finished with your drink, leave. Nothing good comes after that. As older hotels are prone to do, the Palmer House has small rooms. How small? I've literally stayed in hotels that have larger closets than the rooms in the Palmer House. But small rooms aren't always bad. As a solo business traveler, I really don't need a suite. But the layout and functionality of my queen bed room (King wouldn't fit) was poor. The ancient CRT TV took up about 20% of the available room space. I've seen larger bathrooms on cruise ships. I could honestly have brushed my teeth while sitting on the toilet. And to reach the toilet paper requires a Cirque du Solel contortion act. But what has me rating the Palmer House as 2 stars is the fact that the room was loud (the walls are paper thin) and was apparently cleaned in the dark. After two cleanings there was still rubbish from the previous guest on the floor. Hair that obviously didn't belong to me was in the bathtub, and a hand towel soiled with make-up from a previous guest remained in the room even after I set it on the floor to be replaced. I mentioned this to the front desk and they sent someone up to \"re-clean\" the room. While someone did come-up, they still didn't do things like replace the previous guest's hand towel, etc. The wallpaper was torn on the wall and the desk was obviously damaged (missing pieces). I asked four times to have the ethernet cable replaced in my room because the clip was broken so every time I moved my computer I lost internet connection, and they never replaced it. All completely unacceptable. As a Hilton Diamond member I received free internet (which I couldn't use because of the cable) and access to the Executive Lounge. The Concierge in the lounge was probably the grumpiest person I've ever encountered. I asked her about recommending a supper venue for myself and three other colleagues and she barked at me, providing no valuable assistance. The lounge itself is good to grab a cup of coffee (none in the rooms), but unless you like mini croissants the \"breakfast\" is worthless. No upgrade was offered (as per the terms of the Hilton HHonors program), despite the hotel selling higher class rooms on their website for the exact length of stay I was there. I filed a complaint with Hilton regarding the condition of my room at the Palmer House and an Assistance Housekeeping Supervisor called to apologize and offered a free room for a future stay. While I'd normally appreciate the gesture I will never stay at the Palmer House again. The rooms are tiny, dirty, and loud. The staff, for the most part, treats guests like inconveniences.

I had booked a pretty cheap rate (it was under $200) and after reading on here that some of the rooms were quite small, I decided to try for the e-upgrade that the Hilton offers in their email confirmations. The one I ended up with was on one of the two executive level floors, and I paid $35.00 a night for the upgrade, which I believe was well worth it. When I checked in I was a little taken aback by the long check-in line, but it moved very quickly. The person checking me in didn't mention my e-upgrade request, so I asked about it and he checked around and found me a room on the 22nd floor. I liked staying on the executive level. It had dedicated elevators, and what elevators they were! They were very old-fashioned, and had an upholstered leather bench to sit on in case you got weary on your ride up. My room itself was very good-sized, it had two double beds and a sitting area with a TV and a comfortable but very worn easy chair, a chair and desk and two tiny bathrooms. I have to say though, I literally laughed out loud when I walked in the room because the interior design was so old-fashioned. The beds were covered with elaborate, tapestry-like covers and the elaborate draperies looked like they came from Marie Antoinette's boudoir. I did check out the hospitality suite on the 23rd floor that was for the executive level guests one night, and it was quite impressive. They had a full bar (non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary) and an amazing spread of hot and cold snacks, including things like cheese and crackers, eggrolls, hummis, etc. I ordered room service a few times and it always came around the time they said it would. I would say the room-service food at this hotel was a cut-above the fare you usually get at this type of hotel. My favorite part of staying here was the lobby, it was just breathtaking, and I don't think I ever walked through it without a big smile on my face. I had lunch in the restaurant just off the lobby one day and really enjoyed it. This hotel seems to be the hub of a lot of activity in Chicago. One day I walked outside to see a huge police presence, and found out that former President Clinton was speaking at a fundraiser at the hotel that day. I later passed the concierge desk and overheard the concierge assisting a guest with getting tickets to an event the First Lady was holding there in the future.

Our view was of another side of the hotel, so nothing to brag about, but the room was still nice.

There were *tons* of marathoners who had booked here too (I'm guessing from our check in!), and frankly, I had simply lucked into getting this room through Priceline the night before we left for Chicago. (In a nutshell: I was super pumped about the great deal I'd gotten with Days Inn Chicago, which I'd picked after all the TripAdvisor recs. But after mapping out that location, compared to the PHH location, especially given the proximity to the attractions we were interested in -- our walking pizza tour, shopping, the Mag Mile, other attractions all accessible by a short short subway/metro ride -- I just had to see if I could match my Days Inn deal through Priceline. And it worked! Nuts!) But back to PHH: the staff was so friendly -- both check-in and housekeeping. The check-in was apologetic they couldn't offer anything larger or with two beds, but I was certain I wanted non-smoking and that room was all they had. The lobby was *gorgeous*.

We drove from Connecticut and arrived at the Palmer House right after check in time had begun. I can tell you, after driving for 17 hours straight, we looked a fright, but the staff never blinked an eye or treated us as if we were out of place. Everyone from the valet to the bellman to the front desk attendant was professional and kind and made us feel welcome before we even checked in. The hotel is within walking distance of a number of shopping centers and restaurants and only a few blocks from the famous \"Bean\" in Millenium Park. There were two restaurants at the hotel which had menu items we'd heard of but after reading the descriptions, felt all of the recipes were \"trendy\" and \"obscure\" and in all honesty a little intimidating-designed for people with a very broad palette and for the prices, my fiance and I were not about to try out anything we weren't sure we would recognize let alone enjoy so we ate outside the hotel. The rooms themselves are a standard size and the bathroom, while a little small (it was a squeeze to have two people in there at the same time) was very clean and beautifully decorated. We were on the 20th floor and could hear the subway (which ran right beside the hotel) from our rooms which I'm sure would bother some folks, but we found the distant hum to be quiet plesant and soothing. I would definitely recomment this hotel to anyone looking to spend and night or two in the area.

As indicated by the title of my review, it was a very mixed experience. The bottom line is that because of the very thin walls I wouldn't go back there, though otherwise it was a pleasant stay. On the positive side: 1. Since I am a Hilton Diamond, we were upgraded to a very large, comfortable room on one of the top floors. 2. Especially since this is such a huge hotel (1700 rooms?), the service was very good, starting with check-in and including almost all other interactions. Picking up the phone to get room service, housekeeping, etc., I rarely had to wait at all to speak to someone and even if I did wait it was quite brief. And everyone I dealt with was helpful, efficient and polite. 3. Decent lounge and minimally adequate buffet breakfast spread upstairs. 4. Very large, well equipped fitness center. 5. The hotel seemed to offer a pretty good suite upgrade deal to Hilton members, of about $90 (including tax) to get into a very large suite of about 1,000 square feet. It wasn't available when we were there since the hotel was full. But good to know about for less busy times. 6. Easy phone check-out system On the negative side: 1. Perhaps the thinnest walls I've ever seen...or really, heard! We could very clearly hear the televisions and conversations from the adjoining rooms on both sides of us. And it did not sound like the folks next door were shouting or being excessively noisy. My wife, who is a very sound sleeper, had to put in ear plugs. I would have thought that such an old, classic hotel would have had more solid walls than usual, but that was not the case. I did notice that there were doors connecting our room to those on either side of us, so perhaps that accounted for the noise. But I don't know if our room was unusual in that respect. 2. While our room was fine, my wife's colleagues reported that the regular rooms were tiny. 3. For those who love views, most rooms here just look out on interior courtyards; and some (as other reviews have noted) overlook the noisy elevated train line. 4. Even though I'd requested it in advance, I only got the nice upgrade when requesting it upon check-in.

We all agreed the hotel was very nice. The Priceline deal made it all that much better. The rooms were clean, a little small, but not out of the ordinary for a bigger city hotel. I am still surprised to see older tv's in upper tier hotels such as this. The standard tv was fine, but hotels of this caliber should have HDTVs in all rooms by now. It would have been nice to watch some of the football on HD. Everything else was great. The staff here are likely some of the best I've ever encountered. There was a genuine quality about the staff that is hard to find. The concierge helped with directions, getting as detailed on how to get somewhere from where I was exactly standing. There is a Starbucks right by the elevator, but strangely my entire group all thought our drinks tasted \"weak\" and \"different.\" They made mine twice but it still tasted off. Our group visited other Starbucks locations that weekend and the drinks tasted normal, so we aren't sure what was going on at the hotel Starbucks. The pool was closed when we went to look at it, but I heard it is nice. The king bed was fine, not fantastic but comfortable. I know bed bugs are exploding all over the country so it's hard to \"blame\" a hotel for it, but I did find one or two bumps on my legs after staying there. I'm not saying it was because of bed bugs at this hotel, but I'm also not sure where they came from. Our room was located on the inner side of the hotel (not facing a street-side) so we didn't have any problems with road or city noise at all. In fact, I don't recall hearing any neighboring rooms either. The windows opened slightly which was nice during the cool day. Bathroom amenities were great and the shower was warm. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. You can't beat the location. If you can do without a car I would recommend it. Parking across the street is $38 per day. The trains make everything we did incredibly accessible. My sister came from Midway Airport on a straight-shot, 35-minute train ride. We also went to Wrigley Field on a straight-shot train ride as well. Miller's Pub is a great place to catch a bite and beer right next to the hotel.

I went to bed ~ 11 PM and when I woke up at 6 AM that morning, I was surprised to find my upper torso and my left arm and hand covered in bites. Since I live within 40 miles of the Hilton, I went to my doctor to check the bites. Imagine my surprise when I was told they were bed bug bites! I contacted the hotel so they could immediately have the room exterminated and I was put through \"hotel hell\". After over 35 minutes, I was told I must speak to security and file an incident report. I spoke to Lucien Muntean, head of security, and he assured me the room would be vacated and an exterminator would immediately check out the room. I emailed Lucien several days later to ask what the exterminator discovered and never heard back from him. 2 weeks later, another head of security, Ishawa Stephens, returned my email and said he would file my incident report. When I asked him what the exterminator report stated, he said it wasn't done until August 14th, and \"no bed bug activity was observed\"! Ishawa could not explain to me why it took 10 days to have an exterminator check out the room and he apologized for the poor follow-through by Hilton. He knew by the photos I sent him that I definitely had numerous bites all over me. He said he would file the incident report with the Hilton management and I would hear back from them within 3-4 days. That was on Sept. 2, 2010 and I still have not had any follow-through from either Ishawa or Hilton management. I have been put through the discomfort of severe itching , as well as the worry that I could infect my own home with bed bugs traveling back home with me from the Hilton.

Inddor Pool and hot tub were perfect for kids. Pool room is very large but not a lap pool by any means. Seems to have a nice spa and new gym but we didn't use them. The El stop is very close and there are bus stops right out the door that can get you to the Museum Campus and all over the city. The 3 day CTA pass is $14 at the airport and is the way to go for adults. No need trying to find change or add value. Kids under 10 have a special reduced fare card you can get from the attendant at the station (we were at Midway Airport). Millenium Park is about 1 block and is a fantastic urban space. Concierge was helpful with information if not particulaly enthusiastic. I booked the room through the Hilton website and got $157/night which seems good for upscale in the Loop. Overall its a great hotel in a reallly good location for getting the very big city vibe. As long as you're willing to try public transportation its cheap and easy to get all over the city. All the CTA drivers and attendants were very courteous and helpful. Downtown they obviously deal alot with tourists so dont feel bad if you a little confused or uncertain as you get on.

We also wanted something centrally located where we wouldn't need to get our car or take a cab. I read all of the reviews and found that the Palmer fit all of our needs. I was a little worried since some of the reviews mentioned tiny rooms and/or being located near noisy elevators but there will always be a bad review or two. Our fears were solidified when, after check in, we entered an elevator with a disgruntled British woman who was clearly unhappy. She couldn't stop complaining for the entire ride on the elevator. When she got off of the elevator we all wondered what our experience would be like. Let me back up...I booked through Priceline and called a few days later to put in a few requests. We were reserving 2 rooms for 4 nights and I wanted the rooms near each other and I wanted one of the rooms to have 2 double beds. When I booked through Priceline all they showed left were Kings. When I contacted the Palmer directly, they had no record of my reservations through Priceline. They stated I could book 2 rooms as insurance and cancel up to the day before our stay if need be once we worked out the problem with Priceline. I got everything worked out and the hotel was very helpful. The rooms were rather large, were not near the elevator, they accomodated my requests (the rooms were connected with one being a double and one a king). We had a very nice stay. No problems - very comfortable beds. All hotel staff were friendly. The only downside is the parking. $51 per day - but you're in downtown Chicago where every square foot of real estate has a price. They also charge for internet - wireless or wired but with more and more hot spots popping up this may not be a problem much longer but if you're on the 10th floor you may be stuck. Hotel is very close to The Art Institute. Within walking distance of Magificent Mile (a long walk - 1.4 miles). Near shopping on State Street. We walked to Navy Pier. There is a Cafe on the corner right next to the hotel (no access via hotel but cheaper than eating in the hotel). Starbucks within hotel.

Grand Lobby- the hotel is very proud of its heritage (a tv channel dedicated to it). the lobby is grand- from a past era. the rooms were recently renovated, but they're really tacky (peacocks on the carpets, green silky/satin cheap pillows, lime green velvet chairs, etc). The rooms are the size of closets. To the point where they feel unsafe because the hallway door opens directly next to your bed. needless to say, even at 12AM when I tried to sleep, i could hear everything in the hallway and surrounding rooms. its like there is no privacy what so ever. I can get over the small rooms since its an old hotel, but the service is seriously awful and amateur. 1). To use hotel wireless (at $14.95 per day- even for HH Diamond members such as me) you have to get this UFO device from the Front Desk. I inquired, they gave me the device, I had to fill out a waiver, then the desk agent went on a 7 minute search for the instructions. Finally, i told her to stop looking and just had them keep it. seriously, a 12 minute ordeal to pay them $14.95 per day. And, they never offered this at C/I. 2). At checkout, i was charged 8 times for the $14.95 internet. Was charged $85 for the restaurant- which was not my charge- and when I brought it up to the FD, they said it couldn't be fixed until Tuesday- that is, if they decided that I wasn't the one who spent the $85. Why don't they read the folios before they put them under your door- internet charge twice a day for four days?! 3). On day 3, the housekeeper came to my room at 8:30AM, opened the door while i was asleep...i asked her to come back later....left for the day, returned at 6pm, and room hadn't been cleaned. 4). I had access to the exec lounge- it was pitiful. dirty tables, dirty dishes everywhere. only used it one time in 4 days and that was just for coffee and an apple. the food offerings were gross (the turkey on a deli plate was green).

It was a long walk from the elevator bank. Everything was worn out and old, looking like it hadn't been updated in 30 years. Old stained floral carpet, an scraped-up armoire that looked like it came from a garage sale, wallpaper peeling at the seams. The bathroom was very tiny, just enough space to cram a tub/shower, toilet and sink. The a/c rattled loudly. But what caused me to insist on a new room was the amount of mold. The upholstered chair at the desk had green fuzzy refrigerator mold growing on it, a patch as big as my two hands together. The wall near the A/C vent had black mold spores along the ceilings and walls, and heavy amounts had collected in the split seams of the wallpaper. The hotel was sold out and I was scheduled to have a roommate the following night. As a temporary measure, I was moved to a single room for the night - had to wait in line at the front desk again. It was a nicer updated room, but the mattress was not very comfortable. The next day I had to check out of this room, store my bags, and then stand in line and check in again for my next room.

Instead of eating at the Taste, we walked to the lakefront and enjoyed a (crowd-free) hotdog at a small stand overlooking the docked boats. As you walk along the lake, there are plenty of place to eat. Ironically, there is a Robinson Rib stand right on the lake. I was laughing thinking of the hot, sweaty line you would be standing in at the Taste, when a great rib is only a short jaunt away! The following morning, we had breakfast at a local McDonalds conveniently located one block away. Rooms The ceilings are low but the decor is lovely. The bathrooms are small but efficient, with gorgeous marble sinks, great lighting and large mirror. The toiletries are brand name Crabtree and Evelyn products that smell heavenly. The safe is conveniently located in the closet. Most importantly (for us) the soundproofing is excellent. We slept late and enjoyed a very quiet sleeping environment. General Areas After arriving, we threw our luggage in the room and went downstairs to have a cocktail in the lobby. We sat at a marble table with bar stools and people-watched as we sipped our drinks. The lighting, decor and general ambiance of this hotel lobby is wonderful. We grabbed a cab having dinner elsewhere. We arrived back to hotel after dinner and walked down to the lakefront for the fireworks. The fireworks from Navy Pier were readily visible. The hallways to the rooms display classy B/W photos of old movie stars which is a nice touch. Service When we first arrived, check in was a breeze even though it was a holiday weekend. Check out was super-simple. We got a bill slipped under our door in the middle of the night.

The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved. You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in. My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us. I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted. The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a \"Days Inn\" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have. It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties. The TV was extremely dated. No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it. And they charge for the use of the gym!!!!!! Seriously? How can you give your customer subpar accommodations & claim to be a luxury hotel?

I've stayed here before and have come to expect that the rooms at the Palmer House vary a lot - there are very good rooms and ones that give you claustrophobia. We were fortunate to have a decent room (handicapped accessible) with a good sized bathroom. I was disappointed that the TV was an old CRT model, the air conditioner was too loud and the shower had mold around the edges.

We entered the lobby late Friday night and were met with loud hip-hop music being played. I actually walked around looking for the entrance to the club that I thought was off of the lobby until I realized it was being played through the house speakers! The lobby environment left a lot to be desired, I'll leave it at that. Our room consisted of a double bed, 3 feet from the door and about 10 square feet of walking space after you account for the huge desk and dresser (which should not be in that room to account for the minimal space). Not only was the room TINY for 2 people, but it was also right off of the elevator lobby, and with the bed being 3 feet from the door, I was able to share in everyone's conversations as they exited/entered the elevator bank. The toilet that ran all night I'll chalk up to a small maintenance problem and these things just happen. Completely disappointed with the room, we headed down to the lobby for a drink. We watched the waiter pass us 3 times as he serviced the tables around us so my fiance walked up to the bar to get drinks himself. Paying $33 for 2 martinis (tip not included) was a little ridiculous but we figured those are downtown prices if only a bit inflated. If you decide to drive to the hotel, expect to pay $38/night for parking in the lot across the street from the hotel. There is no validation, this is the price the lot charges and the exact same price the hotel charges, so don't forget to include that in the room cost. We parked at the lot on Clark and Harrison the second night -walking distance and $8 for the night- after having learned our lesson and paying $32 for parking the first night, and were lucky enough to find free street parking the next day on Wabash and Jackson (beware of the \"pay to park\" meters that charge $4.25 for 1 hour of parking). Fitness center is $10 to use and don't expect anything by way of free water or anything else because everything they have to offer, they've put a price on. I should say that they did change our room after we complained about the noise/location/size to a normal sized room with a queen size bed and space enough for two people, but I think at that point, the damage had been done and had I been able to change hotels without penalty, I definitely would have. The location of the hotel is great because you're within walking distance to most everything and a short cab ride away to everything else, but I would NOT recommend staying here again to anyone. For the price (room, taxes, parking, fitness, etc), you can stay at a much nicer hotel and I highly recommend staying elsewhere.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans", "Title": "\u201cGood Downtown Business Class Hotel in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "MooneyPilot", "ReviewID": "UR68735451", "Content": "I have stayed at the Palmer House twice in the last month. Both of my stays were nice, but not special. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to lots of great stuff in downtown Chicago. Also it is next door to the L and makes for easy access around the city. The rooms are nice, but not fantastic. The hotel is very old and has some of the lowest ceilings that I have ever experienced in a hotel. The large size of the hotel makes for long hallways and delays at the elevators. To get to the lobby or meeting rooms, you need to allow for a 10 minute commute from your room. Maybe even more if you are on a higher floor... My first room was a nice corner king room that was fairly large. It had plenty of room and a very comfortable chair to work in. The bathroom was tiny though, and your body (I am an average size male 5'11\" - 190 lbs) touches the bathtub and the wall while using the toilet. It felt almost chlosterphobic to use the toilet or take a shower. The bed was nice and comfortable and the room was clean. All in all, for a downtown business hotel, this stay was acceptable, but not luxurious. On my second stay, I was \"upgraded\" to the Diamond floor. My room here was much smaller than my last stay and reeked of cigarette smoke (literally like someone had smoked in the room just minutes before I walked in). I called down to the desk and they swithced my room. The front desk was very nice when I came down and assured me that I would like my new room. My second room was a very, very large suite and quite nice. I did like it, but also realized that I was given it only because of the horrible odor of my first assigned room. I do not think that it is reasonable to expect this type of upgrade to obviously one of the best suites again. Also, I am not sure what benefits the Diamond Floor has, other than the sign as you come off of the elevator to make you feel important. My room on that floor was very small (just large enough for the king bed and a chair) and candidly not as nice as my room just two weeks earlier on a \"regular\" floor. The bathroom on the \"diamond floor\" was tiny, like my former room as well. All in all, this hotel is acceptable for a downtown Chicago stay. The fitness center is okay, very standard Hilton fitness center. The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms are just okay. The staff is plesant enough when you check in.

I used to park my car outside on Wabash which was free if you moved it by 7:00 a.m. Now they charge for street parking 24/7, at $4.25 for every two hours, no limit from 9:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. then $4.25 per hour (two hour limit) from 8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. You can still park in the loading zones for free from 6 p.m., but you have to move your car by 6:00 a.m. There are two parking lots south on Wabash that are $10 and $12 overnight, but they are outside and unattended.

The room was pleasent and clean though no coffee / tea making facilitys. The big problem came next morning, after a wait of about 5 min we were shown to a table for our breakfast, ( although the place was about 1/4 full) there seemed to be an aurgument going on between some of the staff, I enquired what allowance for the meal we were allowed being booked B&B, I was asked to check with the main desk as the waiter did not seem to understand my question. On checking with the main reception I was informed, quite abruptly that we were only booked as room only. I produced a photo copy of my booking and stated that it clearly showed breakfast included, but they would not accept this and stated that my travel agent had made a mistake by telling me this. I asked to speak with a manager but was told they were busy and that the recetionist would speak to the manager later. I returned to the reception later in the afternoon and spoke to a diffrent person and had to explain everything over and I asked that I be shown the original booking in form to prove my complaint but was told that \"the paperwork will have gone now\" where it had \"gone\" on a Sunday they couldnt say but would not produce it. I again showed my copy and demanded that something be done. After a wait I was given 2 small cards and told to present them for a courtesy breakfast. Not wishing to waste a day of sight seeing we had a look around the city but on my return I enquired with a member of staff, was the card valid all week, but told NO only for 1 breakfast. I again complained and eventually spoke to the receptionist that had originally booked us in, on checking my copy she appologised and stated that she had mis-read the booking and etered it wrong on the system. this was the first and ONLY appology we recieved from staff at the main reception, however she did sort out vouchers for our breakfasts for the rest of the week. The night before departure I checked our bill using the TV in the room and found that I had been charged for all the breakfasts we had eaten, once more back to reception and and effort to sort it out, I was promised that it was an oversight and that theere was no charge for the meals,( duely wiped from account on return to room and TV check) however the next morning after breakfast and booking out were again informed that I owed for breakfast. (how many times had I been through this) eventually charges dropped and we left for the long haul back to the UK. Moral, Check and take copies of booking paperwork with you, I always take 2 complete copies as well as originals. The rest of the city is wonderful and people are very friendly, even beggers in the street are polite (if your polite to them) and appologise for asking and wish you a nice day even if you dont give them anything.

It's a very good location for business in the Loop, the Merchandise Mart, and is a short walk to the Art Istitute of Chicago, theater, and the opera. Macy's in the grand olf Marshall Field's building is a short walk away. It's not a bad walk to the tony mega-shopping district of North Michigan Avenue, although some may prefer a cab. While there are glitzier hotels, you can often get a good rate here since it is so large. You can spend the savings on a good dinner. The room felt recently renovated and very fresh (deatils below.) The public rooms are beautiful in a turn-of-the-last-century grandeur. I have visited the hotel a number of times over the years, and the most recent lobby redo is very welcome. There is a convivial bar and lounge area that makes for a very sociable atmosphere - some past years, the lack of furnishings made the place feel less inviting. Now it's back to being a social venue. Room 13157 had only a double bed as requested (usually there's more floor space when I ask for a smaller bed when I am staying alone than if the bed were larger or with two beds.) Very comfy bed and an assortment of pillows. The room does not set records for spaciousness, but it felt like a good size as a result. There is plenty of drawer and storage space, although the closet felt small with the retro-fit safe. The view of was of an alley and airshaft, but it was also quiet, if dark. The room ALMOST has all the typical business-class amenities (ironing board, hairdryer, toiletries, etc.) EXCEPT a coffee maker, which I miss having. Also: no minibar or fridge, which I don't miss. Spotless housekeeping throughout. Annoying things: there is the situation of the duvet without a top sheet, but you can remove the inside comforter easily if you are too warm and use the wool blanket stored in the closet. Also: there is an internet charge approx. $15, which I always find annoying, but less so since the rate was good. The bathroom is very small, although it also felt recently renovated. There is good counterspace to spread out. The tub doesn't fill as fast as I'd like, but at least there is a tub, contrary to the shower-only rooms that seem to be a renovation trend at other hotels. Very professional and friendly service throughout. The hotel had a nice promotion when I was there for guests: a $50 credit for any spa services at the on-site spa. Unfortunately, I was too busy to take advantage. There is a Starbucks at street level, and a newsstand/gift shop. Some complain about the high cost of parking at hotels and lots in downtown Chicago. Get used to it. It is approx. $40 self-park and $50 valet at this hotel, which is in line with many other hotels. The City of Chicago tries to discourage ANYONE from driving car in, and charges high rates even for city lots. There is the odd open lot here and there where you can get away with under $20 for an early-in or late-in rate, but its how it is downtown.

I like being greeted when I get out of the cab with a cheery, welcome home or welcome back. The rooms were clean and kept well stocked. The room was quiet in terms of inside noises (cannot block out all of the outside noise from the city and the El but it was fine).

The lobby of the Palmer House is absolutely beautiful. The location is great. L stations are within a block of the hotel. The rooms and amenities were not so great. The room was beautifully decorated and clean but that's where the appeal of the room ends. There was no WIFI and the TV had about 40 channels. At a four star hotel I would expect over a hundred channels and WIFI. I didn't travel to Chicago to watch TV and surf the internet so that wasn't that big of a deal. The mattresses and sheets were comfy but there was only one very thin comforter on the bed. I woke up in the middle of the night freezing and couldn't find any additional bedding in the room. The walls of the hotel are also paper thin. The term paper thin may be generous. There was absolutely no sound proofing in the walls. I could hear everything from the occupants of the room next door taking showers, turning on and off the sink, talking, and I'm pretty sure I heard someone snoring. Also, anytime someone walked by in the hallway, you knew about it. God forbid you should have little kids staying in the vicinity of your room. At one point in the night, I was awoken by the sound of someone talking and the voice was so loud and clear I thought someone was in my room. Its not like these people were having a screaming match outside of my hotel room. They were talking at a normal voice level but due to the paper thin wells I could hear it clearly. This shouldn't be happening at a four star Hilton hotel. I've stayed at two star hotels where the rooms were better insulated from outside noise. If you enjoy a goods night sleep steer clear of here. My experience was not terrible but it was far from great. Its not like there were blood stains in the bathtubs or dead cockroaches. However, at a four star hotel of the Hilton brand, I shouldn't be able to hear people in other rooms snoring and I shouldn't be able to clearly hear people in the hallway. Its not like the guests in the rooms around mine were having some loud party. I don't know if all of the rooms in the hotel are like this. I was in a standard room on I believe the 20th or 22nd floor. This hotel was recommended to me by my mother. My mother also had to deal with a noise issue. Her room was next to a loud generator or some sort of machinery that kept her up all night. She also payed extra to stay on the executive level. Again, this is unacceptable for a four star hotel. If you plan on barhopping and coming back to the hotel and passing out cold, I would recommend this place. However if you plan on staying conscious and going to sleep sober I would steer clear of this place. If you do end up here bring some earplugs and strong sleeping pills.

This also happens to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downtown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crew hotel for several major airlines. I love this hotel for its location and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grandeur\". Walking into this hotel is like stepping back into time to a truly classical elegant hotel. Its location is also excellent\u00e2\u20ac\u201done short block off Michigan Avenue, the main \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of downtown Chicago. Lobby / Check-in: The lobby is probably the most impressive of any hotel and it is nothing short of breathtaking. Classical architecture with high vaulted ceilings, ornate carpets, accents of gold everywhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opulent to say the least. The lobby is an excellent photo-op for the out-of-town-- not to be missed. Room: My room was a mid-level standard. The overall room d\u00c3\u00a9cor is a throw back to the classical Victorian era complete with wood-work ceiling trim. The room is set in darker olive, teak and deep mahogany colors, very elegant and stately. I had a nice view of the surrounding area from the 6th floor, but unless you are on the uppermost floors, your view will be somewhat limited to the buildings in the surrounding blocks. The windows were of decent size and the drapes cut much of the daylight, but are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drapes. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sensitive sleeper, you may find this difficult after sunrise hours. The glass and walls are reasonably well sound and heat insulated; I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t detect any outside sounds or cold drafts. My room had a small semi-circular work desk with multi-power plugs and direct lamp lighting. There is also in-room (chargeable) hi-speed internet access. The flat-screen TV had full national cable channels, movie channels, pay-per-view movies and several foreign language options as well. The TV is also interactive and you can conduct some hotel business, such viewing your current folio (bill) as well as completing the check-out payment process, directly thru the TV system. There was also a self-service stocked coffee/tea maker and min-bar and a half-sized ironing board and travel iron (in the full sized closet). The bed was a true double. It was firm but not overly so. I slept quite soundly as usual. The sheets were nice and quit soft- not typically scratchy. The duvet was sufficiently warm and more than ample. There were several full sized foam pillows provided (you can request down feather pillows from housekeeping if necessary). The room temperature and fan speed can be controlled within pre-set limits from an in-room control panel. Bathroom: The bathroom was ample sized and done in marble and dark mahogany colors as well. It was equipped with a combination tub/shower unit. The water pressure was excellent and the hot water ran hot very quickly. There was a adjustable no-fog magnification (make-up) mirror provided as well as a plug-in hair dryer. There is also a nice selection of Hilton-branded pre and post-bath toiletries supplied. Everything in my room and bathroom was in proper working order and was sufficiently clean and sanitary as I would expect. Hotel facilities and Amenities: Surprisingly, this hotel does have a rather limited number of dining options. There is only one true full service sit-down restaurant- serving all three sittings, a lobby-level lounge with cocktails, drinks and light fare and a lobby bar for drinks. The lobby bar does feature one of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best and most famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Afternoon Tea\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd services. Reservations for this daily event are suggested as it tends to book full daily. Given Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s range of excellent culinary options- all with an easy walk or a short cab/taxi/subway ride away, you are not captive to the hotel for eating options by any means. As for guest amenities the hotel features an in-house branch of the famous Chakra Spas. Contained within the Spa property is an excellent and large workout room with numerous exercise machines, free weights, aerobic classrooms (with scheduled classes) and personal training available. There is also a mid-sized heated pool as well. You can do pool aerobics or lap swim. The Spa and related services are priced in line with other branches of the Chakra Spas- and can be charged/billed to your hotel guest folio/account. As I would expect any business-oriented hotel, there is a decent sized business center complete with computers (PC and Mac) print/copy/fax facilities- all with appropriate charge. They can also arrange for pick-up and/or delivery of your UPS, FedEx, DHL packages or standard US Mail. There is also ATM and foreign exchange services on property, as well as a sundry and general gift shop. This hotel is also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pet friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and can accommodate selected pets with advance notice and fee. SUMMARY: This hotel has a very grand and opulent look and feel. It is one of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous and older properties, but is well cared for and maintained. This hotel is not for those seeking modern and sleek, but rather classic and stated elegance. Rooms are average to smaller than average, but with classical architecture finishing and furnishings. While there are a rather limited number of full service sit-down restaurants on property, however, given the hotels location, you are can very easily walk/ride to any number of excellent restaurants nearby. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Afternoon Tea service is not to be missed. The hotel staff is unfailingly pleasant and will help as asked and treats you as a respected guest. PROS: Stunning d\u00c3\u00a9cor, architecture and design. You feel as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at a palace or such. Location is superb- only one block off Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Michigan Avenue and access to the metro (subway) is nearby. One of the most elegant Afternoon Tea services in town. CONS: This hotel is priced at a premium to other properties in the same area and many of the hotels features (such as spa, in-room internet and parking) come with steep surcharges.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDon't expect special service\u201d", "Author": "stlgir1", "ReviewID": "UR60112417", "Content": "In general, the Palmer is a nice hotel in a great location.

On check-in I was upgraded to a corner room because of my Hilton Honours status. My colleague wasn't and was put into a small room with no external windows and a view into the jacuzzi...he complained and was quickly moved to a better room on a higher floor. My room, on the 12th floor, had a seperate seating area, two wardrobes, tv etc. No mini bar or tea/coffee making facilities which would have been nice. The bathroom was very small in relation to the size of the room but was functional. Only criticism of the room was the noise from adjacent rooms and from the El trains on Wabash Street. The hotel was VERY busy with two conferences while we were there. It didn't bother me but the service was delayed because of it. Prices were acceptable although $12 for a glass of wine was a bit steep. I queried one entry on my bill when checking out and it was removed immediately.

In the Palmer House's lobby The Lockwood Restaurant & Bar was not overly crowded, service was very slow and unfriendly! We decided not to have another round of drinks as our waiter had disappeared, which he did after taking our order and after serving with his grouchy attitude. Few days after returning home was checking my online billing of our trip charges, alarmingly noticed the charged amount from Lockwood Rest. & Bar was higher amount than our receipt (we always keep our receipts). Come to find out our grouchy waiter decided to give himself more tip money$! Immediately called the management of Lockwood, whom promised to refund the fraudulent charge and take care of the problem with waiter. After 2+ weeks no credit appeared on our charge and the waiter was still working at Lockwood (was this first time this long time employed waiter has increased a customer's bill?$!), we called General Mgr of Palmer House. He advised it was not common practice for their waiters to increase their customers' bill he would pass problem down to his middle management, whom promised a refund. 2 more weeks, guess what, no credit of fraudulent charge$! If you are a Hilton Honors member or not, you can call Hilton customer service number and ask for Corporate Guest Services, who will open up complaint file and investigate a wide range of hotel/customer problems. After 6 weeks with much work and aggrevation ie faxing documents, writing emails, making phone calls, contacting charge card company, being insulted by Palmer House's management whom never followed through until forced by corporate, or really sincerely cared that their customers are being robbed, we received a refund. Now all the manager of the Lockwood Rest. & Bar had to do was issue an immediate credit and simple apology, but most importantly follow though with his promises to take care of the problem instead of sweeping it under the rug and hoping the robbed customer would go away$! This review is to give a heads up to any future Palmer House guest to hold on to all your receipts and make sure to check the total against what is actually charged on your bill $! Hopefully this will save other guests from being robbed and how to get quicker results...

We arrived at the hotel a couple several hours before check in, exhausted and not looking forward to getting ready for her auditions in the lobby bathrooms, as we figured it was too early to get our room, but the receptionist said our room was actually ready then and we were welcome to check in, what a blessing that was! We also received the room upgrade. I think it was an extra 19 bucks, we got a big suite with two niced sized bathrooms, closets, etc. It was a lovely room. I would highly recommend staying on the Executive Floor, if your budget allows. They have huge sitting areas, and unlimited snacks/beverages all day, plus breakfast. I think it was well worth the extra $$$ if you are there for a convention and will be spending lots of time at the hotel. The bed was heavenly, as other posters stated. The best night I've ever slept in a hotel. I didn't hear any noise from rooms nextdoor or barely any noise from the street, besides an occassional ambulance, but not loud. Also, this hotel was top notch for a large conference like the Chicago Unifieds. Plenty of conference spaces, bathroom and water availability; EXCELLENT host hotel for Unifieds. Also, we were able to pay an extra $25 (an option on the check out bill delivered under your door the morning of checkout) for a late 1 pm checkout, which again, was well worth it. Check was simple; just phone your departure time to the front desk. We were also able to store our bags for free (just gave them a nice tip) as we didn't need to leave to catch our plane for several hours after we had to check out. This made it easy to do some shopping w/o hauling our luggage all around Michigan Ave. The only downside was internet (wireless and room connection) was extra $$, even on the Executive Floor. Because the rooms are a little on the pricey side, I could see this being a negative for the hotel, but that's the only thing we would have changed.

We missed our flight out; when we found out that we would not make it out to Chicago that day, we called the receptionist. She checked us into our room even though we weren't physically there so we wouldn't lose our reservations. When we finally got to the hotel the next day, we just grabbed our keys and went up to our room. One minor setback that I will point out is the elevators. They are extremely slow. We stayed on the 18th floor so you can imagine that wait (stairs were pretty much impossible!). The room was pretty tiny. There was barely any room to walk in between the bed and the TV armoire. The bathroom was small as well. It definitely did not come as a surprise to us because we were warned by other reviewers. The size didn't bother us at all. The room had one window and the view was just the other side of the hotel, nothing special. The room looked a little outdated but I could tell that it was renovated a few years back. The bed! It was the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in! As soon as I put my head down, I slept like a baby. The walls are pretty thin but our neighbors were pretty good about keeping their volume down after a certain time. Maid service was good. She gave us extra towels and an extra pillow. The hotel was hustling and bustling the entire time. I think there was a conference going on. We stayed at PH because of Lollapalooza. There were lots of festival goers staying at the hotel. The people were very friendly and everyone had a smile. If you were to use the services at the hotel, it's very pricey. We didn't use any services like the gym, pool, internet, etc because there was a surcharge involved. Room service was pricey as well. But because of the location of the hotel, you can eat elsewhere. After a night at Lollapalooza, my friend and I went to Miller's pub. We also ate at Pizano's Pizza and the Corner Bakery. (I definitely suggest eating at these places, they're great!) We also walked around the area. There's lots of places to shop on State St. Millennium and Grant Parks are both within a few blocks of the hotel. We didn't rent a car. Instead, we took the el from O'Hare to the hotel. It drops you off within a few blocks of the hotel. It's pretty convenient and definitely much cheaper than paying to park our car in the parking deck. I definitely suggest staying here if you have a good deal.

First of all, I want to know where the Palmer House gets off charging guests for WIRED internet, at the scandalously high rate of $18/day? You can't use your laptop in the bed. The service drops without warning and can be quite slow. Secondly, could you perhaps renovate and make the bathrooms any smaller? Seriously, anyone over about 180 pounds would have to squeeze and scrunch to fit into the bathroom I had on the tenth floor. Where is the coffee pot now? I realize the mini bar has been gone for several years (I never use those) but how about SOMETHING in the way of amenities? Nothing very \"grand\" about what I had in my room. The carpet had a disgusting stain on it, and I was actually able to make it \"less dark\" by doing a little scrubbing. Housekeeping? Anyone there? The room had a tube TV and the hotel receives about 15 channels, most of which are of focused interest. How about some TYLand, TBS, AMC, maybe an alternative to the single HBO channel? And lastly, watch out if you order room service. Read the fine print on the menu ... they want 15.4% state and city tax, a $4.95 \"service charge\" for delivery, and if after 11pm, an *additional* 18%. Thus, a $15 hamburger quickly become $30. Buyer beware. And the food is so-so, at best. Skip the fat- and cholesterol-laden breakfast bar. 22 bucks (+ a host of taxes) for that glop? No thanks. (And no wonder I never saw anybody in there at breakfast.) I've stayed in Holiday Inns, Marriotts, and even a Days Inn in the Loop or River North areas that had more bang for the buck. Bye, bye, Palmer House.

It was a nice place, and given its history it is definitely worth staying at if you haven't before and you can get a competitive rate. The location is convenient to Union Station and points of interest in the loop. It's a bit of a hike up to Magnificent Mile, but a nice walk or a bus ride will get you to that part of town pretty easily. The only interaction I had with the staff was at check-in, but found them to be very friendly and professional. Additionally, they were accommodating in allowing me to check-in a little early. The room was very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was quite small but still functional. Despite the positive aspects, the hotel has a number of shortcomings. As others have said, the hotel has a bit of a tired feel. The furniture in my room was newer but already showing signs of wear and tear, including a large knick on the dresser and a completely missing knob on the desk drawer. The only seating in the room besides the bed was a somewhat uncomfortable desk chair. The view out of my room was of absolutely nothing besides rooms on the other side of the hotel, which wasn't very exciting. On top of that, the windows are quite small and the design of the hotel made the room feel very isolated - adding to the general tired/dull feeling of the hotel. The hotel tries to portray itself as a four-diamond level property, while in reality the AAA three diamond rating it received is more realistic of what you will actually experience at the hotel. Again, if you can find a good rate and haven't experienced the hotel before, it's worth it for the historical experience.

There were a lot of towels in the hotel, which I liked. One strange aspect about our hotel room was the large walk-in closet. It had a safe and ironing board, and it was a good place to store all luggage. Our view from the hotel was just to another hotel room, so be sure your drapes are closed so no one can peek into your room. Overall the hotel was great. The location is nice because the bottom floor opens out to the L at Adams. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interact much with the hotel staff because there were so many other people in the hotel.

Consequently street level noise was not a real problem but noise from swimming guests did bother slightly. However getting a cell phone signal was impossible in the room. In contrast to other reviews, my room was not that small and could be compared to other one double bed/standard rooms in other 4 star hotels. However the bath definitely was on the smaller side. For me, the furnishing was impractical. The (office/desk) chair did look nice but didn't have a real armrest. Additionally the desk was too small for a laptop, the telephone and some documents. Working on the bed or in the arm chair was also impossible, as the hotel does not have WiFi in the rooms but cable based internet access. Like the bath, the TV was small too. My request for a later check out time (standard: 11:00 am) was fulfilled without the usual additionally costs. For me this was especially surprising, as the hotel charges for every other service. The mentioned cable internet for example costs 17 Dollar per 24 hour period. The parking garage is located on the opposite side of the street.

The Palmer House has excellent lobby life going on, full of people sitting, talking, rubbing elbows, socializing and refreshing themselves with drinks and food. I feel this aspect sets Palmer House apart from many hotels that seem nothing more than a line of peoplewith little incentive or space to linger, meet and talk to fellow travellers. This historic hotel is packed with art, impossibly lavish ball rooms and enough winding hall ways packed with pictures to qualify as a museam of Chicago itself. I took the executive level upgrade and liked that the room was larger and had two bathrooms, gorgeous decor but the executive level lounge was in my opinion rather depressing offering over priced beer and rather dull and limited snack and breakfast selections. Besides, who would want to linger in the executive lounge when you could linger in the lobby with it's newly and gorgeous renovation of the bar and restaurant. I've been to the Palmer House many times in 40 years and am delighted to see it more exciting than it has been in awhile. On this visit to Chicago I stayed at three hotels, including the Palmer House, the Hotel InterContinental and the Trump Tower.

We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move much during the night (with the risk of falling of), which made sleeping quite uncomfortable. The room was also very small, there was the bed and minimum space to walk around it and a small dresser with tv on top (the smallest hotel room I've ever been to). We asked to change rooms, and like the other couple; we heard that they had nothing else to offer and that we shouldn't book through priceline.com next time! What a shame! Next stay was already booked (and pre paid), so we decided to go anyway. At check in, we already begged for a bigger room, and since the hotel was not so full, they granted us a king size bed room. The room was at least twice as big as the previous one, which was very good. For my surprise after I found a dirty towel among the supposedly clean ones (lipstick marks). I complained and of course they deeply apologized and brought us a new one. Next day I found on the night table one french fry and a Mc Donald's ketchup, and we hadn't eaten there! Cleanliness was clearly very poor on that second stay. Besides, bathtub/shower combination drain was working poorly, so we damped our feet on about 6 ft deep water even when showering, which I find very unpleasant. Called maintenance, it stayed pretty much the same, and we where left with a dirty toilet, full of maintenance guy's footprints (and still not working).

I found the reception staff a bit aloof and quite hard to understand. They rattle everything off so quickly it's hard to take everything in. Anyway as there were 4 of us we were offered an up-grade on our room. For an extra $29 dollars per night we could upgrade to executive level, which gave us use of executive lobby, continental breakfast, hors d'hoeuvres between 5 and 7pm, snacks and drinks all day and use of pc. We decided this would be a good move as breakfast for 4 would cost more than $29 dollars on it's own. This also meant we could use executive lift which doesn't stop at all the other floors. It was definitely worth doing and food and drinks provided were really good. Our room was very nice, (although nothing special considering we were on executive level!). shower was very nice though, with 2 shower heads. Housekeeping was ok although as usually happens, despite the fact there are four of us they didn't leave the right number of towels and we had to keep phoning down for more.

Because of the price I paid I did question if I should write this review...but decided to do so because the Hilton is classified as a '4-star' hotel on priceline...and I found a few things that were not so 4-star about the hotel. First the 'pro's' * GREAT location. * Room was very, very clean. It was on the small side but certainly workable, even though the bed appeared to be something between a queen and a full size, so my 6'3\" husband wasn't all that comfortable. * Never a long wait for an elevator * Starbucks in the lobby was convenient for that early AM coffee run (there are no coffee makers in the room but that didn't bother me as i'm more of a starbucks junkie!) Now the cons: * While the size of the room didn't bother me, the bathroom was very, very small. I am a small person and I had a hard time getting into the shower...it is a tight squeeze b/t the door and the toilet! * The plumbing could use some work. I understand it is an old hotel, but i swear we heard it every time someone flushed the toilet on the entire 12th floor. It was LOUD! Also the water pressure in the shower was highly variable, as was the temperature. I guess the shift from warm to freezing to blazing hot did serve to wake me up, but it was not welcome... * The walls are paper thin. This was the biggest problem that we had. There was a couple that had some kind of domestic dispute going on in the room next to us, BOTH NIGHTS, starting around 1AM. I actually considered calling 9-1-1 the first night, it was that bad (no, I'm not exagerating) but as the conversation was in a foreign language i could not clearly discern if someone was in danger. I was up for hours hearing our neighbors crying and screaming, it was just ridiculous. The second night it started at 1AM, and I quickly retrieved earplugs, but they did not block all the noise. Now this is obviously not the Hilton's fault (the yelling part), but we were on a renovated floor....so we were told....and I question why the walls would not be reinforced during the renovation if the problem with noise filtration was that obvious? I'm certainly not the only person with this problem, now that I read other reviews. Overall the stay was disappointing since we were only in the room to sleep...and that was the only thing we could NOT do. I'm surprised that this would classify as a 4-star hotel, given the plumbing problems, the noise filtration issues, and the lack of ammenities. I have had much better rooms at a Holiday Inn, so the '4-star' denotion is questionable! Of course someone else might have a superb room, so I guess it is the luck of he draw with this hotel.

My husband had work to finish but had a difficult time connecting to the internet. He ended up having to move furniture to connect to a phone jack, and talking to the tech department to sort it out. The internet connection in the bedroom was the only place were it would work. I watched TV in the living room and soon discovered how stiff and uncomfortable both sofa's were. While my husband tried to get his work finished I had a bath in the bedroom bathroom. It had no vent and soon was steamed up and smelling of mildew... We left the hotel for dinner at a nearby restaurant. Came back to have a drink in the lobby only to find it over-run by guests attending functions at the hotel.

When you think of extravegent hotels from the early 1900's, the Palmer House has to be near the top of the list. One chooses the Palmer House because of its history. It is not flashy. Modern hotels may have more ammenities but they lack the charm. It does not matter how many times I walk into the lobby, it is stunning, even opulent. At Christmas time, there is a tree that is beautifully decorated that stands at least 25 feet tall. Check in has always been fast with pleasant help. I have found the concierge to be most helpful. Ask about the hotel's past. The concierge will gladly tell you. They will even give you a packet of information. The rooms, for the most part, are small. The hotel was built almost 100 years ago. This was the style. Yes, the bathrooms are small and lack space. Again, early 1900's! One thing about the rooms that no one should complain about are the beds, sheets and blankets. I believe the beds are Serta Serenity series. They are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, including my own! I like a harder surface. My wife likes a much softer one. We both agreed that this is the next bed we will purchase. The sheets and blankets are very comfortable. I get hot. My wife gets cold. Again, we were both comfortable. I agree with other reviews that the carpet could be updated. Other than that, the rooms are quite clean. The hotel's fitness center is the best I have seen. It is not just a room that has been converted into a health area with one treadmill and an eliptical. This is a mini health club. The pool may not be olympic size but one can still swim laps, unlike most new hotel pools. I have read several reviews of the pricey parking. This is true but parking is pricey anywhere in downtown Chicago. If you drive, just plan for it as part of your expenses. One of the best parts about the Palmer House is its location. The Magnificent Mile is just a few blocks away. Major sight seeing venues are easily within walking distance, the Sears Tower, Shedd Aquarium, Field Musium, the Art Institute just to name a few. Catch a play at any of the several theatres near by. One will not want for great food. There are a ton of great restaurants within walking distance or within a short cab ride away. Miller's Pub, established in 1935 has fantastic food. It is one of those places that celebrities throughout the decades have flocked to. The place is jammed with autographed photos from the restaurant's beginning to the present. The Berghoff is less than five minutes away. Take a cab north, five minutes. You have your choice of Ditka's, The Weber Grill, Smith & Wollensky, Wild Fire... The list could go on forever. The bottom line is if you are looking for a flashy new hotel with all of the modern ammenities, this is not the hotel for you. If you want to experience what life was like for the upper crust a nearly a century ago, give this hotel a try.

I had stayed here 20 years ago and remember having a lovely room with two bathrooms and hoped we could get the same, but I doubted because of our Priceline price. At check in I decided to just go for it and told the check in man (very nice guy) I had stayed here before and upgraded to the executive floor with two baths for $29/night more. He said no problem. This still put my average nightly price at under $100. We stayed on the 23rd floor where the executive level reception area was located and our room was absolutely beautiful and was HUGE. We had breakfast ever morning (includes coffee which is not avaialbe in room), appetizers (they were pretty awesome) every night and access to a computer in the reception area any time we wanted (my kids would go down there when bored and play until an adult needed to use the computer- oftentimes they had to to themselves for an hour). There are separate elevators for Executive level floors that only stop at the 7th, 22 and 23rd floor and we never had to wait for an elevator. The only issue we had with the room was the last night a family checked in next to us and we could hear them plain as day through the walls but since our bathroom area backed into their bathroom area it was only noticeable when we were in the bathroom. We tried the pool (which is free contrary to many reviewers, though the fitness center has a cost) on the 7th floor and were disappointed. Was small and unwelcoming, my kids ditched it after ten minutes. The location is great and my kids really loved Millenium Park playing in the water and we saw an open air concert the first night we were there. It is literally a two minute walk away. We walked up north of the river several times and it really only took us 15-20 minutes to get up to shopping on Mich avenue and the Hancock building. We would walk to Navy Pier and take a cab back ($7). We even walked back from Shedd's Aquarium along the waterfront (20 minutes). Two restaurants we recommend are just south of the Palmer House- Millers Pub and Exchequer (great deep dish). Skip Pizanos around the corner, long wait and average food. Didn't eat at the hotel. Corner Bakery a good option for a quick bite. Parking was expensive. Use self-park which is just east of the hotel on Monroe for a $15/night savings. I understand there are several other options within walking distance so you can research and if you don't mind rolling your bags a couple of blocks (we saw many people doing this) then you can save even more.

If there are no conventions in town, two bills will fetch you a small room on the alley with no view (except looking into other guests rooms). The begger on the street corner welcomes you to the Palmer House. The registration desk is on the second floor up a couple of flights of stairs which is tough with a rolling bag. The 2-5 minute average wait for the elevator is silly. The distance from the elevator to your room can be a workout. My room on the 19th floor had a strong smell. At first I thought it was cheap truckstop perfume, but decided the staff must have spilled a bottle of orange scented cleaner. Unfortunately the cleaner was not used to clean the tiny bathroom (which still had a wet towel from a prior guest). The room had ancient carpet that was bunching up into waves on the floor. The wallpaper was peeling as was the paint on the bathroom door. The HVAC was either all or nothing. The double beds were OK. Being an avid duck hunter, I stay in some dump motels in the countryside, but the Palmer House is the first place where I decided it was best to keep socks on at all times to avoid fungus. The first morning the wakeup call didn't arrive due to hotel computer problems. The second morning the maid staff was pounding on the door before the 7:15 wakeup call arrived.

We knew we'd arrive late. I contacted the hotel prior to our departure for the trip to let them know. The front desk clerk was extremely pleasant that day and offered to upgrade my room to the Executive Level for 50% off. I considered but declined because we would not be able to take advantage of the evening lounge activities and with our original 25% discount, breakfast was cheaper to just pay for ourselves. The only room advantages were a \"larger room\" and extra bathroom. With that said, I thought the rooms would be small but we were pleasantly surprised at how much space there was. The bathroom & beds were smaller than we are used to (standard) but the room itself was nice size, with two closets and a small hallway (my daughter like to play hide and seek in). Although our house has 4 full bathrooms, we all use the same shower, same sink, etc. so the extra hotel bathroom was a non-issue. While talking to the desk clerk, she mentioned there were 800 people checking out and 900 checking in that day. Phew! So, while on the road, I called a second time to let them know we would be arriving late. It seemed like about the time all 900 people were checking in because I was put on hold for quite awhile and had a hasty conversation with the evening clerk. I wasn't sure they got the information right but in the end they did. We did have to drive around the block once because the hotel entrance/valet parking was a bit hidden and confusing amongst all the taxis and traffic checking in. We did not take advantage of the $51 a night valet parking. Instead, we asked the hotel valet clerk about parking and we parked ourselves for $36 a night in the building next door. Check in was pleasant and fast at 10:30 pm. Only a couple people in line. We were a little taken aback at how large the hotel is and how many people 900 actually is. We maneuvered our luggage between guests & crowds to find the elevators. We knew when booking the hotel there was not a frig in the room so we tugged along a Quest cooler with wheels and kept changing the bags of ice. It saved us a bunch of money to have a few treats and drinks on hand for the kids instead of paying $30 everytime someone wanted a snack or the outrageous hotel room-service costs. In looking at the room, they could very easily install a frig (plenty of room). The Starbucks on the hotel ground floor was must close early. My husband and 9-year-old tackled the streets of Chicago at 10pm in search of another Starbucks. It was only a block away (drinks were still cold when they arrived) but they were stopped by a homeless looking person, asking for cash. Oh the price to pay for a fruity drink & coffee! We had the breakfast buffet both mornings. It was very good (although a little pricey) with a variety of choices, even fresh fruit. Someone was constantly filling or replacing the food. We even took a bannana with us! Our youngest ate free and we took advantage of the weekend kid special of $4.99. I would say it is comparable to country club pricing and variety and service. We knew there was an upper class fitness center on site. My husband and I run so we planned to take advantage of the facility. We didn't know the \"small fee\" would be $18 per person, per day! Pricing should be by the 1/2 hour. Also, we were asked if we wanted access to the pool. I was excited to think there was a pool other than the hotel pool. The fact is, there is not! The fitness pool is the same as the hotel pool, they just have a separate entrance. The pool was ok. It was very crowded and they ran out of towels. The pool is only open until 9 pm so everyone with small children was there at 8. I don't know how the fitness center people managed to swim/exercise through the mass of children. Checkout was a real pain. I had a billing question so I headed down to the lobby. But to get to the lobby was quite the trick. The elevators were jammed and refused to stop on the floors to head DOWN. We had to go UP to go DOWN. I never got my question asked because the people checking in were weaved in and out of the ropes in a very long line. I ended up using the hotel phone to do the easy checkout. We did check our bags to be held for free at the Monroe Street entrance so we could eat breakfast wihtout being surrounded by luggage. The room was clean, the stay was nice.

Thankfully we didn't travel to Chicago to spend a lot of time in our room. The location of the hotel was great. We were within a couple blocks of the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and plenty of dining options. The nearby CVS and Walgreens are also nice to have when you need those essentials.

The hotel is one block from Millennium Park (where the Bean is) and also about one block from The Art Institute of Chicago. - The hotel is huge.

The only strange thing was that the TV was on the dresser in the corner of the room, but I only watched for about 30 minutes the entire trip. - There is no free Internet wireless, which was kind of disappointing.

However, there was no loose wallpaper, the room was extremely clean, the carpeting was nice, the beds were comforable and the lobby was beautiful.

We asked for a room upgrade - another $25 charge, EVEN IF you are a Hilton Platinum or Gold VIP. No coffee maker in the room. Would you like one? $12. Forgot your toothbrush? $5. When I pointed out that every Hilton we have stayed at in the past 2 years has offered these things with no charge, they informed me that \"our policy changed.\" The ambience: It is an old hotel, and while the historic aspect is nice, what this means is that the rooms are quite small, and there is a potentially a LONG, maze like walk from the elevators to your room. The executive lounge, which you CAN access with your room key if you are a Hilton VIP (even if you are not on the concierge level) was okay. Free coffee, tea, soft drinks. Continental breakfast (pastries, cereal, yogurt, fruit) is served in the morning. They do have happy hour finger foods from 6 pm. Not the most elaborate spread, but not the worst either. As I mentioned, the service was the worst part of the hotel. I was told when they had checked out that the hotel has 1600+ rooms. Yes, that is 1600+ rooms. No wonder NO ONE EVER ANSWERS the phone. Each time I called to the front desk, I was on the line for literally 2 minutes, with no answer. Once, when someone finally answered, I had been transferred to the Hilton by O'hare Airport!!!!?! WTF??!?! Not only that, but when we checked out, they had charged us $7 for making an outside phone call. The only problem was, we both had cell phones and never used the phone to make an outside phone call! It appears that they actually had the nerve to charge me for the call to the front desk that was somehow misdirected to the O'hare Hilton! And, you shouldn't be surprised that I had to argue with the front desk staff to have the charge removed!

The reason being only ONE double bed could fit in our room - how I wish I was kidding. Our room was the size of a postage stamp. Don't get me wrong - having asked for a rennovated room, our room was incredibly stylish. But when two adults are squeezed into a double bed... it's like being in college again. Neither of us could actually open our suitcases in the room (except on the bed) because the floor space simply wouldn't allow it. Mine had to go in the closet & his stood up on end (the only way it would fit). We don't typically use the dresser in a hotel when only staying overnight - why unpack only to repack? We had, quite literally, only one foot of walking room between the bed and the chest of drawers (left side), one foot to the wall/closet (center), and one foot to the desk/window area (right side). Having to strategically open/close certain doors to stand behind them to move around means a room is TOO SMALL, renovated or not. I can only really recommend this hotel if you either a) don't care about these things or b) are willing to pay full price to get what you want. I've used several discount websites to book facilities before and NEVER wound up in a room so tiny.

I had a special rate for an event and it seemed like they made sure I knew that because I got that special rate, I was not going to get the same experience that a guest paying full price would pay. This was particularly concerning to me because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Hilton Honors member and I always go out of my way to stay at Hilton properties so it seemed a little short sighted (in my opinion) for them to jeopardize that long term relationship by making sure I knew I was in the hotel equivalent of steerage. Staff: Overall, the staff was nice and helpful. People were friendly, but the check in was odd. They had a sign for a Hilton Honors check in, but when I asked they said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it and to just wait on line. Then the guy seemed to take forever to find a room. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer the normal perks I would get with my membership so I had to ask for those, which is just out of character compared with any other property I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. Facilities: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an old hotel but with a very elegant lobby. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very beautiful, so your expectation when you walk in is that this is a wonderful place. And if you are lucky enough to get a renovated room, it is. However, the room I had was on the 18th floor and it was definitely the smallest room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in the US. There have been a couple of rooms in Europe that were smaller, but this was tiny. And other people who were staying in the hotel with the same rate had nice rooms, some with two bathrooms, so that was disappointing. Additionally, for an old hotel, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think the walls would be thicker. I could hear my neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television through the wall and in the bathroom, you could clearly hear conversations from the next room through the vent near the ceiling. Additionally, when the next room turned on the shower, it made a high pitched hissing/squeaking sound that made conversation impossible. It was really, really loud. That said, the room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. The elevators were a little slow, but everything was nice and not worn down or dirty. We had access to the executive floor that had a continental breakfast in the morning. The room with the food and coffee is poorly laid out so even with only a few people there it gets congested quickly. The PC they have for guest use on the exec floor is also incredibly slow. It took 15 minutes just to print out a boarding pass because each page took a long time to load. This led to other guests thinking you were hogging the computer when in reality you were just doing one thing. Highlights: The lobby was beautiful and a nice place for a drink. The staff, especially the cleaning personnel and the doormen, were nice. The location is great. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re close to the old Marshall Field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (now Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), close to transit, Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park are just a block away. Areas for improvement: The elevators were sometimes very slow and several times I saw people taking elevators up to the top floor to go back down because they could not get an elevator going down. The way the hotel nickels and dimes you makes you feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a cheap motel where you have to pay for everything that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nailed down. The health club is an extra $18/day ($10 if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an Honors Gold member) and internet access in the room is priced from $15-20/day. Valet parking was $51/day, which is high but probably not too different from other downtown hotels. Overall impression: This hotel left me with mixed impressions. The lobby leads you to believe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be staying in a luxurious historic hotel, but if you get a non-renovated room, you might think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a gulag instead. And then when the hotel tacks on fees for the gym and internet, you might as well pay a full rate somewhere else and get the services included rather than have them added on a la carte. That just seems cheap to me, especially the way this hotel is positioned. If it was a Motel 6, yeah, I understand they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll charge for extras but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unseemly in a nicer hotel. I would not stay here again. Next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in Chicago, will probably stay at the Hilton. I am a loyal Hilton guy, but I do not think the Palmer House adds any value to the brand. In fact, it diminishes it in my opinion and makes me reconsidering always staying at Hilton properties. I shared my feelings with the customer service manager (this was right after I realized that a large group of teenagers was moving into the hotel the night before I was going to leave and about 40 of them were staying on my floor) and he did offer to move me to a better room and comp a night. That was nice and I appreciated it, but if they had a nicer room to offer, then they should have done that to begin with rather than stick me with a smaller room and hope I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain. Reactive customer service is never as good as proactive customer service. Nearby transportation: Very close to all major subway lines on Wabash Avenue or State Street.

The bathroom was not small either although I'm sure in the smaller rooms it could be small. No water problems or anything. Even the elevator was quick (but the hotel was quiet for the 1st 2 nights of our stay).

Everyone was extremely polite and friendly. A smile goes a long way. The concierge was outstanding. Aside from giving us great restaurant and logistics advice, they booked almost all of our restaurants in the evenings. Extremely thorough service. The bathrooms are a little small; big deal! How long does anyone need to spend in the bathroom when in a hotel anyway? The pool in the leisure centre was tiny, which is my only real criticism, and we probably would have made better use of that area had it been bigger. It seemed crowded as a result any time we walked by. In short, the hotel is fantastic. Do not hesitate to stay here. I had called in advance to arrange flowers for my wife who was celebrating her birthday during our stay. Everything went like clock-work. I would definitely not be afraid to stay here again and hope to in the near future.

I travel often for both business and leisure and have gotten used to the piling on of fees (resort fees, internet fees, gym fees, etc...). But this place takes it to a new level. I arrived at noon. Normal check-in time is 3 pm. As I typically do, I asked if I there was an available room I could check into. They said there was, but that because it was prior to 1 pm there would be a $25 \"early check-in\" fee. I've never heard of such a fee and it doesn't make sense. If a room in the category I paid for is available whenever I check in, they ought to let me have it without requiring a fee. I used the gym (decent, but not equal to a full gym) and was surprised to be hit with an $18 fee. That is the highest I've had to pay.

Chicago can be a hit and miss town when it comes to reasonably priced hotels. There is no doubt the city offers great 4 and 5 star properties - the question is at what cost. For whatever reason, the Palmer House - now owned by Hilton, seems to be a hotel that will offer just that blend of luxury and value at certain times in the year. I gave it an 'average' in terms of value because when prices go up, this hotel's room rates go right up with them. It is located just off the Monroe Red Line (the \"L\") so you can easily take the \"L\" from Midway or O'Hare. I am sure some of you shudder at the thought of staying at a hotel like the Palmer House and riding Mayor Daly's public transit in. Personally I've done taxis, shuttles and the L is the cheapest and I never had an incident using it. Doormen at the Hotel open the door promptly and greet you as you enter the Palmer House. The first thing you may notice is all the steps in this building as you enter. If you have knee problems or just dislike stairs, this is not going to be a fun hotel for you. The check in counter is up quite a few stairs and it is a bit of a walk to go find the elevator to get up there. Also at nighttime - they close certain outside doors for entry back into the hotel - so before your taxi or ride drops you off - make sure you are at the right entrance and street or you will have a brisk walk around the building. In December, I learned this the hard way and I was pretty chilled by the time I reached the main entrance. Check In - I arrived a bit early - 30 mins prior to check in and the gentleman was polite but firm that if I checked in early there would be an early check in fee. I just waited out in the lobby, which is a fine elegant lobby that you can comfortably sit and wait in. Elevators are prompt and well lit - good decor and clean interiors. I was in a standard room that was a bit smaller than the average hotel, but it was well done. Attractive wall paper and framed art hung in the room - nice plump pillows and a very comfortable bed with the customary flat screen TV. Remote worked fine and the carpet in the room was new as well. Bathroom was a bit cramped - although nice and bright and clean. For a business traveler - it seemed to suffice - i would think for a family or even two people traveling this may be a potential issue. Overall - The Palmer House - a great place to stay for business travelers - if you happen upon it during a slower season, you'll be treated to a great hotel for a fantastic rate.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee, wi", "Title": "\u201cRats !!!!\u201d", "Author": "disgusted1967", "ReviewID": "UR27293409", "Content": "My wife and I left in a hurry last night and stayed somewhere nicer down the street.

An exclusive elevator whisks guests directly to floors 22 and 23 from the lobby and street level - a great bonus if you don't like stopping at every floor at these big hotels.

The lobby takes your breath away from the mirrored walls to the fresco ceiling. Our room was VERY comfortable, nice bed - the only bad thing was that the bathroom was small - hardly any room to set vanities that we brought along, so we had to keep them in our suitcases until we needed them. The bar is wonderful - and they make THE most delicious Hot Buttered Rums, which we partook of when we came in from Navy Pier on New Year's Eve from watching the fireworks in 0 degree weather. :) Although - they are quite expensive!!! We each had to drinks and the bill was $53. But just sitting in such a beautiful place made it worth that total. The staff seem friendly enough, and allow you to meander through the whole place on your own. I enjoyed all the photos of celebrities past and present (mostly past) who had come to the Palmer House to perform through the years. We found lovely shots of Eartha Kitt - Dorothy Dandridge - Sonny & Cher and the like. It's actually how we remembered how to find our room in this huge place until we got the lay of the land. :) One of the things that I REALLY loved was the fact that the El runs right along the street only about half a block from the hotel, so you can hear it all night coming through, which I adored.

The Lobby is absoulutely gorgeous as everybody else mentioned, not much more to say about that. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice and really made our trip, as it was cold and there wasn't too much outdoor sightseeing to do. We were able to celebrate our son's Birthday in the suite and have our whole family over to watch the Bear's game, where if they would have won they would have gone to the Playoffs. (Don't get me started on that) The suite had been remodeled and was very spacious, the other thing we noticed about the room that it was completely handicapped accessible. We thought that was great. My only thoughts for the next time we stay there would be to request a room on the side of the hotel that is not nearest the \"El\" tracks. They take a little getting used to. The beds were incredibly soft and comfortable. They have ice machines on the floor which is great, you don't need to order room service to get a bucket of ice. There's a Corner Bakery and a CVS pharmacy within 50 feet of the hotel if you forget anything or just wanted to grab some munchies for the room.

Our options were to order room service, get up and get dressed and go downstairs to Starbucks or the front desk now has coffee pots for rent.

The room had updated furniture and bedding; the bathroom was very modern, very clean and quite big enough for one person to get ready in, great lighting in the bathroom. The beds were so comfortable that it was difficult to get out of them in the morning. The lobby area is probably one of the most ornate and beautiful hotel lobbies that I've been in. AREA: There is so much around this hotel to do. All around this hotel are streets and streets of great shopping and restaurants. Two blocks and you're at Macy's, H&M, Nordstrom Rack, to name a few. A few blocks to the east and you've got the beautiful Park. The 'Bean' Sculpture is there and is a must-see, just for fun. An Art Musuem is located near the park, as well. There's a great Pub/Restuarant right next door to the hotel. We dined there twice because we liked it so much. There are great restaurants within walking distance on each side of the hotel. There is a CVS across the street for soda's and snacks, so you won't have to pay 4 dollars for a Coke in the hotel. We had to hire a cab (less than 7 dollars), to go further up Michigan Avenue for more shopping. It could have been walked however, it was close to 20 degrees outside and we were freezing.

We we got to our room and it didn't smell like smoke at all, not even a hint of smoke in the air!

Neutral (things that didn't bother me, but they may bother you): We had a busy day and were knocked out by days end, but if your a light sleeper the L-train is a wee bit noisy, and the room walls are kind of thin. Bathroom tub could use an upgrade. Pillows were decent but could have used a little more fluff. Negative: NO COFFEE POT - I have seen this complained about alot on this website. As a \"listed\" 4 star hotel there should be a coffee pot in the room. I guess the hotel would rather have the entire hotel go down to starbucks, spend an hour in line and pay 4 bucks for a cup of joe. Potters Bar in the hotel was very nice, but the drinks are pricey!! If you don't need the swankey ambiance of Potters, go next door to Millers (which is not swankey but very nice) and pay half the price for your cocktails. One other negative - the 6 to 7 pm evening rush had you waiting forever for the elevators. On our way down (from the 16th floor mind you!) we eventually gave up on the elevator and took the stairs.

I'm an Honors gold card holder and this room was on a dedicated Honors floor so thhis can't be the worst they have. There was just a bed and a desk in the room - no comfortable chair, no table for room service to be placed upon. When they deliver your room service breakfast they put it on the bed. The size of the bathroom was worse still. The room was only clean on the surface. Jutting out from underneath the bed was a blood stained towel and a large a amount of trash. These remained for the first two of the four nights I stayed there - as did the hairclips on the carpet. Room service breakfast took 50 minutes to arrive one morning. I called Guest Relations to tell them this and to let them know that there was no hot water in my bathroom. They just said they'd fix the water (which they did) but no word of an apology on either count. On other occasions when I called Guest Relations the phone remained unanswered. One evening I tried to use the pool. The Guest services Directory in the room was empty, the advert for the spa in the elevator told you this was on the 5th floor but it turns out its actually on the 8th floor. I went to the Spa reception on the 8th floor and the receptionist there directed me to the 7th for the pool. On the 7th there is a door to the pool and one toilet cubicle- no changing facility or showers. I retunred to the 8th floor and they told me I could access the pool form there (where there were proper locker rooms) but that 'I wouldn't be able to get back'. I said this was crazy - they agreed, but again did nothing further to help - so don't plan to use the pool because, although it is newly renovated and looking good, this is impossible apparently. On checking out I joined the Honors line. It didn't move and no effort was made to clear it. After 15 minutes I joined the main line which, although slow, moved eventually. The automatic doors to enter and leave the property also move way too slowly - really irritating after a number of days staying there. The newly renovated public areas of this hotel look great - the bar etc., but I really cant think of anything else that I enjoyed about my stay.

The man stayed on the phone the entire time he checked us in (which I found to be not only rude to us, but also to the people trying to carry on a conversation on the other end). We again had to reorientate as the lobby area was filled with \"cocktailers\" on business trips (which did not bother me, but did make it a bit difficult to navigate through with our bags). I will add that the ambiance on this level was absolutely spectacular. It definitely takes you back a century, and is phenomenal to take in. We arrived on the 17th floor only to find that our room key didn't work.

We got into our room, and it was clean, but not eclectic or modern in any way. Still the old TV. A decent sized bathroom. The room itself was very small, but if you're only staying a couple of days, then it is manageable. Don't expect the typical Chicago boutique experience in this hotel. It's hustle and bustle is at it's best. Concierge is pleasant, but not overly friendly. Efficiency seems key, not friendliness.

C'mon, Hilton, have a heart! A cup of joe would make life just a lot better. Oh, by the way, the walls are pretty thin. The shower was great. Wi-fi daily rates are exorbitant.

I've stayed at a good number of hotels in Chicago, and I am always intrigued by the hotels with a rich history. I'm also a big fan of the Hilton line-up of properties, nationwide, as I'm active in the Hilton Honors program and find it be very rewarding. However, the charm of exploring a Hilton hotel that is new to me wore off quickly. Once we discovered we were going to be arriving 3 hours later than expected, due to airline delays, we called the hotel twice, letting the staff know we were indeed going to be checking in, and asked the staff to please hold the king renovated room we had reserved (which we were holding on a credit card). We were told both times that the room we wanted would be held. But, once we finally checked in, weary from the airline delays, the front staff did not tell us we weren't getting the room we had expected. The room that we ended up with instead of our requested renovated king was one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, with a double bed that the hotel calls a queen (but it's actually the size that most of us would call a double or full-sized bed). The bathroom was tiny, with a small square of floor space in which to position one's feet while using the sink or the toilet. The room had not been renovated, and, judging by the photos others have posted, the renovated rooms are worlds better than what we had. Decor was worn and dated. There was an unpleasant odor in the room, though not strong, and we weren't able to identify the source. As others have written, the walls between rooms are indeed surprisingly thin. I slept with ear plugs. We did have a window, and the view featured a wall with windows of other guest rooms. On the plus side of things, the hotel's location is fantastic. I really enjoyed wandering about two blocks to the Macy's and TJ Maxx on State Street. The bellmen were quick to hail a taxi for us. We found the room service to be a bit pricier than expected, but service was fast and available at extended hours. Of course, the lobby area is gorgeous and tends to be buzzing with people enjoying the many comfortable, intimate seating areas in the lobby. When our elevators were stopping on other (renovated) floors, it looked like the decor on those floors was very attractive and interesting. I was envious. The gym and pool were still being renovated when we were there, so I didn't visit that area. I don't want to air a bunch of dirty laundry here, as that's not really appropriate, but discussions with hotel management were disappointing and did not yield any apologies, sincerity, or special offers (discounts, free meals, etc.) in reaction to our disappointment. Admittedly the hotel was well booked due to a conference, but, to me, the preemptive calls from us and assurances that all would be well upon arrival were meaningless in the end. I always try to give management a chance to repair the situation while the issue is fresh, and this is the first time I can recall dealing with a Hilton manager who declined to ask anything along the lines of \"Is there anything I can do to make this situation better?\" and/or offer some kind of discount or gift (free meals/drinks at the hotel restaurant, for example) in reaction to a problem. It was disappointing to encounter a situation like this one at a Hilton property. I just didn't feel like a valued guest at all, and I felt like my active enrollment in the Hilton Honors program meant nothing at this property. This hotel has lots of potential, the location is nice, and the renovations look promising. But I don't think I'll come back. There are too many fantastic hotels in Chicago, and too many proven, good Hilton options to take a risk at trying the Palmer House again.

You'd think that a hotel of this stature that must cater to thousands of businesss travelers would be better equipped, and just more sophisticated with regard to basic technology.

There's a window, but when you look out, you see the fire escape in extremely close proximity and beyond the black metal stairs is a brick wall.

One night we invited our friends back to the hotel for drinks in the Lobby which is absolutely breathtaking and even though they had a function in the Empire Room they let us peek our heads in. It's neat to see where some of the \"Legendary Entertainers\" performed. We enjoyed the history of the hotel even though all the renovations aren't complete. However, we also didn't pay full price so it definitely exceeded our expectations. I'm giving it 4 stars only because the renovations aren't totally complete but everything else was 5 stars in our case.

Pros: 1. The decor of the hotel is gorgeous--really opulent and old-world charming. Our floor had black and white photos of all the jazz and pop vocalists of the 50s that played there on the walls. 2. It's just around the block from the nearest subway station. 3. Contrary to what I've read some people say here, I thought the staff was super friendly. The concierges, in particular, were WONDERFUL. No question was too small or too dumb! 4. We paid a super low price ($73) 5. It's also only 2-3 blocks from Michigan Ave and everything downtown. We were pleasantly surprised to discover how centralized the location was. 6. Others have mentioned the recent renovations, but since we weren't in our rooms during the afternoons, we didn't encounter it to a large degree. 7. Super comfy bed with wonderfully comfortable down bedding and pillows--lovelovelove! Cons: 1. Our room, while nicely furnished, was a bit on the small side. I requested a king bed, and it pretty much took up the entire room. However, there was ample closet space and the bathrooms were surprisingly big. 2. A large tv, but it only had around 10 random channels. 3. No fridge. Why?!? 4. We had the same issue someone else here had. The first real day we were there we got back into the hotel around 5:00 pm and housekeeping had still not been there! When I called the front desk, the person didn't appear to fully speak English and it was a pretty weird and frustrating conversation that ensued. We finally got our towels later that night. 5. It's an old hotel. The first nights we were there I guess there weren't many people on our floor because everything was pretty quiet. The last night, however---OH MY GOD. It was like people were actually in my room and closet. It was weird b/c there was a fire extinguisher closet on one side of us, and yet we could still here every single word and sound of a couple hooking up in the next room. Not Pleasant. Our other neighbors seemed to be speaking in normal tones, but once again, it was VERY AUDIBLE. If you stay there, I would highly recommend getting a room far from the elevators, so that there might be less noisy traffic. Overall, the experience was pretty good.

Since then, it has been burned down (Chicago Fire) and undergone multiple owners and renovations. Currently, it is undergoing another face lift and we just got back from a quick one night trip there. We got the hotel through priceline so we paid under $100 for the night. The hotel is huge (over 1600 rooms). Our check in was easy and all staff we came in contact with was very nice. We stayed in a standard room (8th floor). The exterior is definitely a mess as others mentioned but the lobby still looks great and the bar creates a nice feel to it. The hallways on the room floors have been redone completely. Square Frames hold soft focused b/w pictures of famous performers that once performed in the Empire Room back in the day. Extremely classy. Our room was large. The colors were bold (bright greens, reds, black and white, deep cherry woods). Nothing bad to say about the decor inside the room. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were great. There was a desk with an internet connection (believe it was an extra) and another lounge chair with an ottoman. The bathroom was small. There was a bowl sink which was a nice touch and i think they kept the former floor and wall tile. We did have hot water (noticed that was mentioned) however the fixtures for the shower were old and the water pressure was sub-optimal. The tolietries were Crabtree and Evelyn and were ample and pleasant smelling. There were plenty of towels. The TV was a small tube tv that was very far away from the bed (one of the minuses of a large room) and they also had Figi Water to intice you but it was $6.50 per bottle. (Hint: stop at the CVS across the street for snacks) We ordered room service for breakfast and it was nice. Overpriced but very good food. We did not eat at the Lockwood so not sure how that was even though it was advertised a lot. The hotel is in a great area of visitors who want to do shopping downtown, see shows and be close to Millenium Park. State Street shopping is a must along with a visit to the bean. Finally, I noticed they are adding a lot of amenities to compete with new build hotels (flat panel tv with announcements, kiosks to check in to your flight with printer, trendy bar that is being built and complete renovation of the fitness center). I will admit, i am a sucker for places with rich history so the hotel already won me over with that. I have stayed here over 10 years ago and remember my experience being pleasant but this past one was definitely above average. I wouldn't say this is a family focused hotel however the rooms are big enough for a few kiddies on rollaways without you tripping on them. There was nothing that was negative about the stay HOWEVER, the amenities that are being renovated take away from a full Upscale experience.

The staff is indifferent at their best, rude at their worst. Simple requests are a burden to them. For example, while checking in at the HHonors desk, I asked to be put in an outside room, because wireless reception in the hotel is terrible, and if you want to use your cell phone or broadband card, you have to be facing the street. The clerk said I would love the room. When I opened the door, it was an inside room, exactly what I didn't want. I called and asked to be moved, and was told I'd have to speak to a manager. When I explained to him that I wanted an outside room to use my wireless card, he shouted, \"We don't have wireless in the hotel!\" I explained to him that with my broadband wireless card, I did, and wanted to use it. He then said, \"I'll send someone up,\" and hung up on me. Nice. Also, they were renovating the hotel. They had closed the fitness center, which they didn't mention on check-in.

When we arrived, we were told the elevators were not working in the main entrance. So my husband and I had to drag our luggage up the stairs to the lobby. It was only two flights of stairs and we can handle it but we wondered how an elderly or handicapped person would get to their room. There were bellman but there were also 20 or so people waiting for their services. The check in process was fine and finding our room was easy so no problems there. Once we got in the room, we realized the walls were paper thin. I suggested getting another room because of our noisy neighbors but we decided to stick it out. Little did we know what we would wake up to the next morning. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK. That's the sound of hotel renovations. It's high pitched and loud. Enough to make any dog want to howl. We tried to drown it out with the fan in the room to no avail. Then the drilling started. This was 7am. We just decided to get up because obviously, the noise would not be ending anytime soon. This went on every morning we were there. We were out of the room during the days so we are not sure how long this went on. On a positive note, the rooms were very clean, updated and housekeeping always kept the room stocked with fresh coffee and towels. I didn't have to ask for anything. The concierge was very helpful when we needed directions and many times suggested alternatives in order to save time. Overall, housekeeping, concierge, doormen, and the reservation desk offered great service. We had a studio room and other reviewers have suggested they are closet sized rooms. Well, sign me up for that closet! The studios are much larger than people are suggesting. I would put them at about 15'x18'. Not huge but not tiny either. I never felt cramped. We had a king instead of two doubles so maybe they are referring to a studio with two doubles. There is plenty of room for 1-2 people in a studio. If you have kids, I would suggest a larger room though. A good restaurant I would suggest is Miller's Pub. It's near the hotel on Wabash between Monroe and Adams. We wanted a bite to eat late at night and when other places were closed, they were still serving at 11pm on a Tuesday. It's Zagat rated too!

I had fond memories of this hotel, but I had been warned about its downhill slide in recent years and the renovation currently underway. Both turned out to be accurate. As for location, you can't beat it. Right in the heart of the Loop, within easy walking distance of nearly everything in the downtown area. In its day, The Palmer House was the go-to place with a great supper club, Trader Vics restaurant and an arcade of shops on the lower level. Sadly, all are long gone. The lower level is completely closed off, and there's no word what will be going in down there, if anything. The standard-issue overpriced hotel restaurant is off the lobby, taking up a lot of space and making the once spacious lobby seem very cramped and crowded. There is no escalator on the street level, so you need to haul your bags up a pair of staircases, then cross nearly across the lobby to the front desk, which is very busy (even the desk for Hilton Honors members was jammed). This appears to be a hotel that makes its money on meetings, mini-conventions and groups. To my pleasant surprise, elevators ran well and you never had to wait long. I stayed in one of the older rooms and it was a huge disappointment. Smaller than some hotel rooms in Europe, with a postage stamp bathroom and a shower only (which means a hole in the wall, with ceramic tile and a flimsy shower curtain -- not unlike a dormitory). I am told some rooms are bigger; I hope so. For a one-night stay such as mine, this is OK, but I would get claustrophobic if I had to stay longer and there is no workspace to speak of, so good luck trying to get any work done. The \"business center\", if you can call it that, is actually the UPS office, with three terminals that charge for internet access (one of my pet peeves -- how can this be free at Embassy Suites and Hamptons but not in the rest of the Hilton family?). Even if you don't mind paying, forget about privacy or peace and quiet while you work. People are constantly in and out shipping packages and talking loudly. Hilton is pouring some serious money into this hotel, but it may be too little too late. Deferred maintenance is everywhere, from faded carpeting to peeling paint in the hallways and rooms. Half of the older rooms should be eliminated and combined into suites. For the money, there are far too many other acceptable alternatives for me to return to the Palmer House.

First room looked old and faded. The bathroom was so small that one person in the bathroom could barely close the door by leaning off to the side and then slowly closing the door. We asked to be moved. The next room also was old and faded and quite a lot smaller than the first room. But the bathroom was about twice the size. Now, twice the size means it was still a very small bathroom but at least one person could easily utilize the sink, shower and the toilet. There was still no place to put toiletries. When first checking in, I asked if there was a possible upgrade for me (I was with my wife and daughter). I am HiltonHHonors Diamond and usually get upgraded to executive level or to a suite at a Hilton Hotel. She responded in a rude tone that I would surely like the room I was in. It turned out to be the miniature bathroom room. The room did not have enough towels for three people. Called down and they brought up extra towels. Next day room was again not supplied with enough towels. Called down and they were brought up. Next day was the same. It does not seem like a big deal but how many times do you have to ask for enough towels. The hotel provides in and out self parking with a garage next door. They validate a ticket for the in and out after we paid $30 per day for parking. Twice the validation did not work and I either had to pay an extra $29 or get another ticket at the garage and then get it validated again at the front desk. Both times the front desk staff acted if if it was my fault as if I had not validated the ticket. Hotel is under construction and there are a few inconveniences involved with that but construction is a temporary issue and I cannot fault that.

Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $150 million renovation and the \"Chicago\" charm is being killed off in favor of \"New York-New York!!\" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last 40 years. The last time prior to this visit was in 2004. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the 2004 visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the \"bellmen\" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not. The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the \"We're completely sold out...\" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good. The restaurant \"Lockwood\" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries. Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on 21 and then 15 is hideous! I describe at as the \"stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry\". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess! What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think..... Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago. We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous.

Last year was great. Not to say that this year wasn't, because it was. This year just had a few bumps that will not matter in a year. The Palmer House is doing some major remodeling. They do not really have a hotel restaurant, which is a problem if you don't want to spend $25 on a children's cheeseburger and a Coke. No joke. For the conference in the past we would have to stand inside of the side doors of the hotel and wait for the busses to come. This year, those doors and that floor are being renovated so you have to go out the front of the hotel and around the side and stand in the extreme weather of Chicago. It was freezing cold and there was no shelter at all. The day we checked out we had to stand there for 40 minutes in blowing snow and freezing temperatures. The bellman took our bags and dropped them next to the street where we had to stand. He held his hand out though... they don't miss that. Which brings me to my next point. Upon checking in we encountered a bellman who we had to get from talking to the group of other bellmen so that he could get a cart, which was behind his stand. He grabbed our bags and slung them like he used to work for the airlines or something and then wheeled them iside the doors (about 10-15 feet) and said... \"Ok, this is as far as I go with your bags\". He repeated this to me about 5 times before I realized he was asking for a tip. Each time he said it... he was less and less friendly. That was irritating since he really didn't do much and was so relentless about the tip when we clearing had just forgotten to give it to him... which we ended up doing once I realized what he was saying. The high speed internet (which you have to pay for) was anything but high speed. It was like having dial up. Really bad. Also, to use the pool or workout facility... you have to pay. I think that's realy bad. Almost unheard of as well. The rooms were fantastic. We were on the 25th floor and had adjoining rooms to the rest of the family. Housekeeping was great and the executive level was awesome. The showers in the room were so wonderful that I honestly looked forward to my showers and could stay in there long enough that I turned into a prune. They were GREAT! We are actually going to buy the same shower head for our bathroom. The beds were like sleeping on clouds. No kidding. They were amazing and cozy. The concierge on the executive level named Alegra was GREAT! I can't say enough about her. She was extremely helpful and very very nice.

My mother is disabled and she looks forward to her annual Christmas visit to the Palmer. This year, when we arrived no one was there to help with the bags and we carted them inside ourselves. The elevators were unavailable, and we were told my mother had to climb the two flights of stairs. When I protested, a security guard was called and he unlocked a door & pointed us into a construction hallway. Again, we hauled our own bags and wound around until we found the elevators. Once up on the main floor, I had my mother sit in the overly crowded and dirty lobby. I am very shocked at the changes. The lobby looked like a bad bar scene with all the half drained wine goblets & beer bottles sitting on tables and even in the chairs. The grandeur of this promient lobby is now dwarfed with over-sized booth-like chairs making a horrible maze to get to the check-in desk. The young european lady who check us in spoke very little english. I wanted to confirm that the handicap accommodations for mother were in place. She \"yes\"ed us away so she could move on to the next patron. We were treated like a number not like a family meeting to spent a lovely long weekend in Chicago. On to the food accomodations, ONE restaurant! What has happened to all of the hotel's restaurants? We breakfasted in the new \"Lockwood\". Would you believe the hostess tried to seat my disabled mother in a round booth? When we explained that this booth, though lovely, would never work, the young lady lead us to a pub style table with elevated chairs!!!! Finally, we were seated at a traditional table with chairs. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the only reason I did not rank this visit \"terrible\". I would recommend this buffet to anyone, no matter what. I am not sure we will repeat our Palmer Holiday season visit next year - it might be time to start a new tradition. I hope your visit goes better than ours did.

The breakfast buffet didn't look worth the cost so I took breakfast mainly in a Beef & Brandy round the corner in State St, much better and a calm oasis compared with the hotel.

Never did. Tipping at the front desk when checking in at the PALMER HOUSE HILTON, D O N' T. This really kills it for tipping industry! The hotel was nice. Rooms very small especially the bathroom. Good location. PARKING, I was charged $90. for three nights. The Palmer House automaticlly charged my credit card and put the receipt under my door.

The rooms were refurbished and therefore well appointed, if maybe a touch on the small side. The hotel is surrounded by other high rise buildings and does not boast the best views of the city.

The hotel serves it's function as a well-placed city location and offers a good standard of accommodation. It lacks in facilities such as a decent bar, while the pool, gym & business centre were all extras that needed to be added to the cost of staying there - disappointing that the Hilton chain feels the need to do this.

We took the blue line train from Chicago O'Hare as the hotel is only a block away from Monroe blue line station (the Monroe red line station is right on the corner only 2 minutes away from the hotel, Adams station on the El is just at the back of the hotel too). It only cost $2 each but took forever to get there, almost an hour and finding the blue line station at the airport was quite tricky. Had to go through a car park to use an elevator to get to the lower levels but even then had to take a train from Terminal 5 to Terminal 2 or 3, not clear at all. We eneded up getting a taxi back which came to $40 but was much quicker. The location though is perfect, right in the heart of the loop and everything is easily approachable on foot or Subway. Once we found the hotel, you have to go up a floor from the ground level to the lobby (which is a fantastic site) so hauling 2 large bags up the escalator was painful but we eventually found the elevators at the back of the hotel. Checking in was quick and easy, we asked at the time if we could get a room as high up as possible and thumbs up to the guy, we got one on the 21st floor which I think was as high as we were allowed to go before you hit the more expensive rooms. First impressions were good, we were worried about size on the reviews but we got a good sized room, more than enougg for the 2 of us. The bed was enormous and extremely confortable with all the pillows, a big TV with plenty of channels available, a walk in cupboard with plenty of hangers and included an iron and board hooked on the door and a big desk area with coffee and tea making facilities. The view was not much though looking down on Monroe but set back into the hotel but traffic noise was never a problem. The air conditioning was very good and not too noisy although it was only on for short periods, never overnight. The bathroom was fine, a bath/shower combo which had a good power shower. The only thing which kept getting us caught out was the taps, they turned the opposite way to what we were used to so continously sprayed the bathroom each time we wanted to turn it off. Each morning we had breakfast a the Big Downtown which was accessible from the shopping arcade of the hotel. The hotel is still going through some modernising and this is the only place where you can see this happening (I think in earlier reviews this area was not even open and the restaurant had to be entered from outside the hotel). There are the occasional loud bangs in this area but unless you are seated right by the inside door you don't notice it too much. The buffet is definitely the best choice for value, only costs $15 dollars each but the food was brilliant. Sausages, bacon, scrambled egg and breakfast potato. Don't know what they use to make them but they were the nicest potatoes I have ever had. Coffee and juices on tap as well as cereals, pastries and fruit all available and the decor is really good with a little model loop train going round just under the ceiling. We booked the room through Airmiles which costs us 5340 Airmiles plus \u00c2\u00a3140 which if paid with cash for the whole thing would be roughly \u00c2\u00a3460 which for 4 nights I thought was excellent value.

The location is ideal, within walking distance to many tourist destinations and there is a red line stop right outside. The hotel really is awe-inspiringly beautiful, and offers modernly appointed, very clean rooms with amazingly comfortable beds and linens. There are great restaurant choices all around the block, and discounted self parking directly across the street. And while those good points have not changed, there is now a glaring and growing fault. The guest service has been on a downward slide for the past few years and this visit did nothing to encourage me that there is a positive change on the horizon. On a previous visit (two years ago) I had a very unpleasant encounter with a concierge, but dismissed it as an isolated exchange, until my next visit (six mos later) when the representative checking me out was more interested in placing his coffee order than completing my transaction. On my most recent visit I was blatantly ignored by the person working the HH members desk when I attempted to check in. I stood in front of him for no less than five minutes while he continued to silently stare ahead at a monitor. I was in no hurry and could have waited longer, but he didn't acknowledge me at all, so I went to the reception desk. Doug, the representative that registered me, was wonderful. He was professional, friendly, welcoming and even upgraded my room. When I returned later to thank him, I believe he genuinely remembered me, and if he didn't, it speaks well to his aptitude that I thought so anyway! Unfortunately, even his adroitness wasn't enough to change my opinion, as excellent customer service at a four star hotel should be the rule, not the exception.

We stayed on the 18th floor (I don't think the room was renovated, I'm not sure, the bathroom fixtures didn't look new though), and had no problem with noise whatsoever, and I slept in (past 9AM!). The room was spotless, quite large (although it seems rooms must vary greatly in size...the one we had at least 3 feet between the end of hte bed and the beginning of the TV, and a little sitting area with two chairs and a small table, as well as a desk and a small hallway entryway.) The bathroom was a bit small, but okay...water pressure and temperature was fine. The toiletries, as stated previously, were very nice. Spacious closet as well. There was a nice alarm clock you could hook your mp3 player up to, which I appreciated. The bed was extremely comfortable. I actually think it was better than my bed at home!

If Red Roof Inn can give me free wireless internet access in my room, why the heck can't the hilton? Instead it costs 12.95 for 24 hours. Same thing with the fitness room. It really seems ridiculous to charge 11 bucks a day if you want to work out. I guess they want it to stay less busy, but it just seems silly to get nickel and dimed when you stay at a 4 or 5 star hotel! Isn't the point of staying at one that you get better service, not worse? The elevator was VERY slow! Especially if you are trying to use it during prime check in/check out hours, it really takes a while to get on the elevator.

We were in Chicago to see the sights and attend a play and were sorely dissapointed with the hotel accomodations. While the Palmer House location was great since we were going to the LaSalle Bank Theatre, I'd take a cab to the theatre and stay someplace else next time. The proximity to the Art Instittute and free trolley were nice, but there are other locations close to better shopping, other sites, and more restaurants anyway if you venture up closer to N. Michigan Avenue where the rooms are bigger and the staff friendlier. Our stay started out poorly and never got better. The Hilton Honors receptionist was extremely slow and certainly not welcoming. Because we had read the reviews concerning rennovated vs. non-renovated rooms, we asked specifically for a renovated room when we checked in. We were told that there were none ready yet (although it was after the 3 pm check in time) so we offered to leave our bags with the bellman and come back later. After waiting quite a while without a bellman appearing, we ended up lugging our bags down a level to the storage room ourselves. We returned around 5:30 pm after killing most of the afternoon wandering down State Street, and were given a room. It was renovated, but the SMALLEST two double bed room I have ever seen, and it overlooked a roof with the fire escape right outside our window. Both of us were very dissappointed in the room, and also sorry we had wasted an afternoon of our time in the city waiting to check in, given this was the \"upgraded\" room we were going to receive. The service matched the rooms. In fact, the only word that comes to mind for the concierge is \"snooty\". Perhaps it was because we were dressed like tourists in shorts and sandals. (I usually travel for business and treatment of business people seemed to be much better!) While our questions were answered, it was in a very abrupt and non-helpful way and I observed another mother being treated the same. In fact, she was looking for options for her children to ride a boat on the river, and I stopped her afterwards to suggest if they did not want the 90 minute tour she could take them on the water taxi--something the concierge did not even mention--possibly because she did not get any commission on water taxi rides! Several other reviews have suggested this is a great place to go have a drink in the beautiful lobby and see the \"old gem\" but you'd get better accomodations and superior service at a lower price elsewhere. I'd have to agree. We've stayed at the Embassy Suites on N.

DO take some time even if not staying here to walk in, sit down and marvel at the restored frescoed ceiling - touched up by the same artist who restored the Sistine Chapel! The front desk staff was friendly and courteous. The room was spacious and two bathrooms for 3 guests was hard to beat! I appreciated the helpfulness of the concierge staff and on one occasion requested a recommendation for dinner within walking distance. The gentleman's suggestion was such a hit, we went back to thank him after our meal and then returned to the same restaurant for another meal later in our stay. The ONLY complaint I have about this hotel was that our key cards (7 keys total for 3 guests over 3 days) NEVER worked properly. On arrival, we could not enter the room with ANY key and had to return to the front desk for new keys. One guest's keys never worked the whole time we stayed. On another occasion we couldn't get any key to work, went back to the front desk and advised that we were having such a hard time. The response of the staff at that point was disappointing, something like, \"Yeah, we know there's a problem.\" That's all, they knew there was a problem. Not, \"We're trying to fix it\" or \"We'll send maintenance up to change out your door lock\" or even \"We apoligize for any inconvenience\". That could have been handled better ESPECIALLY when they know there's a problem and it was obvious we came all the way back to the front desk from the 18th floor to be able to get into our room! I would have rated them 5 stars if it hadn't been for this indifference to the inconvenience of their guests. That aside, as I said, I will look forward to staying here again.

LOCATION This hotel is in a terrific location for the fireworks. You are two blocks away from the Taste of Chicago and the Petrillo Band shelter. If you go one more block east, you walk thru Buckingham Fountain and are right at the Lake. The fireworks are set off from a barge on the lake, and this is the perfect location to see them. SECURITY There was a virtual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sea\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of people flooding the streets after the fireworks. We walked in the crowd and got to the front of our hotel. There were at least 10 security guards outside the hotel, asking to see your room key before they would let you in. I thought that was great. When we left our room initially to go to the fireworks, we saw a security guard patrolling the halls on our floor. He spoke to us and said the hotel was a full capacity and all the security staff were working that evening. This hotel really had their act together. LOBBY AREA The common area of the lobby features a gorgeous bar and many comfortable, elegant high-back gold velvet chairs scattered throughout. There are comfy sofas, cute end tables and coffee tables too. The tables had a beautiful vase with glass marbles, water and lit candles floating amidst fresh, fragrant flowers. The lobby smelled heavenly as a result of the floral displays and the candle d\u00c3\u00a9cor really added a nice touch. My husband and I had a drink there around 7pm, before we went down to see the fireworks. As soon as you sit down, a waiter gets your drink order and gives you a snack mix (chex mix kind of thing) to accompany your drink. Just sitting there gazing at all the frescos, paintings and elaborate moldings in this historic room is worth staying at this hotel. It was lovely. SWIMMING POOL We did not go swimming due to time constraints, but we did go to the 8th floor to see it. The pool is rectangular and small. (This is NOT an Olympic size pool or anything\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I would estimate that it is less than one half the size of an Olympic size pool.) There were chairs scattered around so you could sit and watch the people swim while you read or something. The ceiling is really high and glass (like a greenhouse) which would let in lots of light. There were parents with kids swimming while we checked it out at approximately 7pm on Tuesday night. ROOM We were on the 18th floor. When the elevator doors open, there are pretty chairs and floral arrangements in the lobby area that look really nice. We got to our room and found it to be adequate. (After all, we were just sleeping there.) The building is really old and as a result, the ceilings are kind of low. (Around 7 feet, I would say\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) For example, I could literally reach up and touch the ceiling fixtures in the halls and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only 5 feet 1. Our room was a little on the small side, and seemed smaller due to the low ceiling. The bathroom was really super-tiny. My husband kept bumping his arm into the walls in there as the tried to brush his teeth at night. But, it was clean and well-decorated. The soaps and shampoo stuff was Crabtree and Evelyn and smelled divine. The room had a coffeemaker in it. PRICE I booked the hotel directly on the Hilton website for $179.00. They add a room tax later which brings the bill up to a little over $200. I felt that was reasonable, given the great location during a holiday. PARKING We live in the suburbs and drove into the city. We used the Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valet service and let them park our car. That was $38. It was kind of pricey but we were willing to pay for the convenience. We wanted to simply drop off the car, check in to the hotel and then wander around. So it worked out well for us. Plus, when we checked out the next day, they got us our car in a matter of a few minutes. That was great. I saw a self-park high-rise garage right next to the hotel, but during crowded holidays I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how that would be. (I think the sea of people after the fireworks would have kept you from pulling out for hours and hours. And the frustration of trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153find a spot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the garage in the first place, seems like it would be a pain to me.) OVERALL This is a nice hotel with a historic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to it. The location was great for our purposes and all the staff we dealt with (check-in, security, bar, valet etc) were professional, polite and friendly even though it was obviously a busy evening for them.

My thoughts: I'd booked a room at the hotel's Looptopia special, which was just $99 a night, which just assured me one double bed. On arrival, I requested an upgrade and was upgraded free of charge to a room with two double beds, two closets, and two bathrooms. The room was clearly a combination of what had been two separate rooms and, though oddly laid out, was quite roomy. The bathrooms were very clean and modern enough for an old hotel. It was not as nice as what I'm used to in the US (it would be great by European standards) but it was acceptable. From the hotel's online pictures I'd expected that the rooms would have been remodeled. There weren't. The beds were older but fairly comfortable, and had duvets and nice linens. The tv, phones, curtains, chairs, furnishings, and carpet, though, were very dated. We were on the 20th floor, so no problems with street noise. Only noise from neighbors was running water and flushing toilets, which were easily heard in our room. I felt a bit nickel and dimed, though, as the hotel didn't have a really business center and charged for internet access in its two public computers. Most hotels offer this free. Also, the key card wallet contained a notice that they include a USA Today in the cost of the room and if we didn't want the paper we could call the front desk to cancel it and have the bill reduced by 75 cents a day. We did not cancel the paper, but did not receive it either. We were charged for the paper. Finally, not having a mini bar was annoying. The fridge was locked with a note that food and beverages were available through room service only. The bottled water in the room was 3.95, which is far more than other hotels. The concierge was quite helpful and always on duty, and the front desk staff were very polite.

The room was large with two smallish double beds, a sofa bed facing a coffee table and 32\" TV and DVD player. There was also space for a work desk, extra chairs and table with coffee maker. The two windows faced other rooms and there wasn't much of a view. Because we were on the last floor there was a good amount of natural light. It looked like the room was renovated recently, it was nicely decorated and had an upscale feel to it. The two bathrooms were on the small side, however we preferred having two small bathrooms than one large one. The towers lounge served breakfast, hors d'oeuvres and snacks and drinks throughout the day. The breakfast was a little light but hors d'oeuvres were satisfactory. One other advantage of the towers lounge is the private elevators that take you directly to the towers levels from the lobby. We never had to wait long for an elevator. On the 23rd floor there was no noise or disturbances from the renovations. The location of the hotel is fantastic with easy access to the blue line to and from the airport and many other lines. Also very close walking distance to the Art Institute. There are a few restaurants around, coffee shops and convenience stores as well. One disappointment was the fee assessed for every package I had delivered to the hotel. Most hotels usually keep them at the front desk which is easier and free. Here you have to go to a UPS store on a different level and they will charge you $5 for each item. Other than this I have nothing bad to say about our stay. It was nice to stay in a property with more character and history than the usual Hilton. Judging from the other reviews, you obviously have to make sure you get the right type of room if you want to have a good experience at this property.

We walked into the hotel and thought the lobby was indeed worth the hype. There was a small section that had been closed off due to renovations, but it didn't not detract much from the beauty. The check-in was painless, but there weren't many people at that hour. We got a pretty big room. 2 queen? sized beds, 2 comfy chairs, ottoman, tv, minibar, desk. The furnishings did look a bit worn, but it was clean and the beds were comfy. The bathroom also was indeed a bit small, but it was good enough. We had no view really, but we weren't expecting any to begin with. We did hear the train, but it's Chicago...we did not hear any renovations at any time, but I must admit we were hardly in the room in the day. The gap between the floor and the door is also indeed huge, I can see why people said it was loud. It let in a lot of light, but even tho we were at a T-intersection of the hallways, we never heard anything. I also barely heard our neighbours to either side. The location is fantastic as many others have said, close to trains, bus to museum campus, Miller's pub right downstairs for late night food (most other things are closed), and the Corner Bakery served a pretty good breakfast. It's also a block away from the park and the park parking lot (which is a lot cheaper than Palmer house parking). The only complaint I would have is after extending our stay (again via priceline), we asked them two times if it would be ok, and if we would have to check out and recheck in. We were told both times that we were fine. But lo and behold, when we got back the next day, our keys didn't work and we did end up having to go down to get them recoded.

I was a bit surprised to find a well-dressed gentleman packing his bags as I walked in- he said he was an executive at the Palmer House and was just leaving. No problem- the room looked completely undisturbed. Executive Floor goodies in the evening weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad- a cash bar, but the food included empanadas, veggie spring rolls, a very nice assortment of cheeses, and fresh fruit. There was also a case of complimentary soft drinks, water and juices. Not much of a view, but extensive seating, a large TV and plenty to read, along with an employee who helped with check-in and check-out. I got back to my room after a dip in the pool (smallish, typical of city hotels, over-warmed, over-chlorinated) and found a complimentary bottle of wine with a note- apparently from the guy who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been in the room! Very nice touch, and it was good wine. Health Club (fee for use by non-HHonors members) had a lot of new-looking equipment. Cable Internet was reliable and was $12/day- not bad compared to Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s properties in Europe. It would be even better if it were included in the room rate, of course. Executive Lounge breakfast the next morning was pretty much standard continental breakfast fare.

I'm now a diamond Hilton Honors member, but started my stays here as a lowly blue. I feel at this point I've experienced pretty much everything the Palmer has to offer, and this review will reflect my years of experience with this hotel. (I apologize in advance for the length!) The Palmer is a classic old hotel, with a lot of variability, and your experience here will depend on a number of things: -- How full it is. The hotel is VERY popular with tour groups. If you are checking in at a time a tour group is arriving, you may find the lobby very crowded. (The lobby is presently undergoing renovation, and the roomy, spacious seating areas have been, at least temporarily, eliminated.) -- What room you have (size). The Palmer has some of the smallest (US) hotel rooms I've ever seen (usually called \"studio\" rooms on their website), but it also has some of the largest. I've stayed in everything from a studio room where the bed pretty much occupied the entire room to suites that were bigger than some apartments I've lived in (one suite I've had a couple of times must be close to 1000 sq ft). My advice: inquire about room size when you book your room. The size of the bed is not necessarily correlated with the room size. A room with one double bed can be larger than a room with a king or larger than a room with two double beds. On the other hand, studio rooms can be good bargains if you don't mind having essentially no free floor space. -- What room you have (view). Many rooms at the Palmer have \"views\" over building infrastructure or what seems like directly into other rooms. If you want to avoid this, ask for a room that faces directly (not obliquely) onto Adams or Monroe. Nowhere in the Palmer has \"great\" views, but streetside views will at least let you see some skyline. -- Your Hilton Honors level, if any. I've always been treated courteously at Palmer House, even before I joined the Hilton Honors program, but diamond members do get better treatment and additional amenities. Now on to some specifics: -- Executive floor. Honors members have access to this, but it can be hard to get a room on this floor (it's the 23rd floor). If you want the executive floor specifically and not just access, be sure to request the 23rd floor. Breakfast is served (fruit, yogurt, donuts, muffins, bagels, juice, cereal, etc. -- no hot items other than what you stick in the toaster), as well as hot hors d'oeuvres in the evening, and cookies and snacks at night. Soft drinks, juice, bottled water, and coffee/tea are available for free any time the kitchen area is open (typically around 6.30 AM till 11 PM). If you're staying on floors 21 or 22, it's usually quicker to access the 23rd floor via the stairs (bring your key; you will need it to get out of the stairs on the 23rd floor) than the elevator. -- Fitness center. Open nice and early on weekdays (5.30 AM), and fairly large, although it can get crowded during weekdays, when there are a lot of business travelers. I've found weekend mornings to be far less crowded. If you're not at least a Hilton Gold (I think Gold and not Silver, but don't quote me on that) member, there's a charge. Theoretically, there's a 25-minute limit on equipment when other people are waiting, a policy I don't agree with. -- Elevators. There are three banks of elevators at Palmer House (plus a semi-hidden \"executive elevator\" set), and they go to three separate sets of floors. You can transfer between all elevator banks on the 8th floor, which is often easier and faster than transferring at the lobby or street level. If the hotel is very full, or if one or more elevators are down for repairs, you can have quite a long wait for elevators. The executive elevators are accessed from just across from the concierge's desk, but they only go to a limited number of floors and require an executive-access key card. -- Rooms (continued). The Palmer House is undergoing an extensive renovation, and some floors are closed. Also, the beds and amenities are being replaced piecemeal rather than all at once, since the hotel is remaining open during renovations. Some rooms have the new beds and amenities, and others don't. Ask at the time of your reservation if this is important to you. Standard amenities include shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash; upgraded rooms often have robes and fluffy bathroom rugs that the other rooms don't have. I'm not sure if Palmer eventually plans to put all amenities in all rooms. -- Staff. I've never been treated anything other than courteously at Palmer House, but competence of staff has varied. Twice (in over 50 stays) I've been charged for minibar items I didn't take (both times I was credited promptly when I noticed the charge). (It appears that Palmer may be discontinuing its minibar service; during my last 2 stays in Feb and Mar 2007, the two rooms I was in no longer had minibars.) Rooms have typically been kept quite clean. Repairs often are not made promptly, and it can be quite some time before room-service items are removed from halls and floors, and trash is picked up. I've never used room-service delivery so can't comment on that. -- Location. Palmer House is located south of the Mag Mile area, so if you're envisioning Mag Mile/Rush Street-type activity at night, you won't find that around Palmer House. Dining in this part of the Loop is typically fairly poor in terms of variety and hours. Many places cater to the lunch crowd and close down at night. A plus is that the hotel is within walking distance of almost all downtown theaters (e.g. Goodman, Oriental) and extremely close to the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Note that usually the Wabash and State Street entrances close at night (hours of closing vary), and you must use the Monroe St. entrance at that time and show your key. I've walked around this area alone late at night many times and never felt unsafe (I'm female). I would avoid dark alleys and doorways, though. -- Public transportation. Extremely convenient to the Red Line el (a stop is located just outside the State Street entrance) and the Brown/Purple/Orange/Green Line els (a stop is located just south of the Wabash Street entrance). A few blocks to the nearest Blue Line el stop. One block from Michigan Avenue buses. --Parking. The Palmer House's \"official\" garage is the 55 E. Monroe complex, currently undergoing a major renovation and accessible for entry only from Monroe St (the Adams St exit is occasionally open, depending on construction activity). Both Monroe and Adams are one-way, so you need to plan your entry and exit to the garage well in advance. Cars tend to get very dirty in this garage at the moment because of all the construction dust being kicked up, so if that's important to you, park elsewhere. Rates are slightly discounted with a Palmer House stay, but are still expensive. -- Noise. It's an urban hotel; you will probably hear street noise no matter where in the hotel you are, although I consider myself quite noise-sensitive and I've never had trouble falling asleep because of noise here. Rooms facing Wabash are somewhat noisier because of the el directly underneath. In summary: I love the Palmer, despite its flaws -- it's like an old, familiar friend whose flaws you tolerate because of all the good things about her. By asking for what you want, you can avoid a number of the flaws and significantly improve your stay here. I hope others find the beauty in this old gem as well.", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines", "Title": "\u201cClean under Remodel,dont pay full rack rate but otherwise Perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Branuga", "ReviewID": "UR7171867", "Content": "Stayed during Big Ten Torney!

In the lobby is a big costume jewley stand avoid this tourist trap at all cost with so much nicer shops all around why waste it in that over pirced costume jewelry. The room was very small as seen in the pics first one showing the bed / tv /desk area was taken from small lead in hall way by a small but very clean mable floored big bath tub bathroom. Careful the bottled water in the room is now 3.95 per bottle! 2.50 in the vending maching down the hall, there is a 7 eleven around the corner or a white hen one block down. One great plus about the room. The most comfortable bed I have slept on in years in a hotel .The Pillows were perfectly soft slept very well both nights there. The pool was small but nice an relaxing didnt use it to much maybe 3o minutes to much to do all around the area to sit an waste in pool.

Great find the first night there their staff very friendly and the food was 4 star at 1 am ..recommend the feta and cheese and olives for the greek lovers and the baked chicken .for breakfast travel to the state street side and you can find BEEF n Brandy, Very cozt little diner that at night turns into a locals bar upstairs great breakfast biggest bang for the buck and is high quality with free wifi if you need to internet search for things to do in the area.cost 13 a day in the hotel. State street is lined with great shopping..macys nordstorm;s rack so on.. but go up michagn ave toward pierson and michagan to the water tower area, Some of the biggest retails are up in this area. Cab's are cheap so valet and let them do the driving , if you know where your going and sound smart the cabbies are ok. but you gotta pay attention for there are some bad ones there.You just say stop here pay them and get a new one.

Internet acess available in the lobby cost $4.95/15 min. + $1 per page to print, and when I had problems with the printer they were rude and dismissive. Similarly unhelpful on the question of where one might dine nearby (in view of the renovations and closed services) they handed me a list of 40 or so \"nearby\" establisments. Some of these were 4-6 city blocks away. The beds ,linens and bathroom facilities were superior, the housekeeping fine, heat and hot water quite adequate. Our room, however, was tiny and cramped with a \"view\" of a dark and gritty inner courtyard. The electronic door locks (ours and others I observed) were a real trick to open and I had to get one of the housekeeping staff to open ours for us the first time. (She said to me with seeming surprise \"They gave you this little room?\"- one has to wonder.) It was a great disappointment and I felt we didn't get good value for the price. Perhaps if I complained I could have gotten a switch or had them fix the door, etc., but I am not a complainer and don't feel I should have to complain to get a good product and good service.

Having 3 years ago had a terrible experience at the Chicago Hilton Hotel and Towers (didn't honour booking, after we'd been travelling about 20 hours, terrible check-in staff, and awful beds - with no alternative firmer mattresses in a 1700 room hotel!) this Hilton experience was the opposite - an excellent hotel. We checked in around 2; were swiftly given a large corner room on 21st floor with windows on 3 sides - I had specially requested high floor away from elevator and this was perfect, even with a view of the lake - which due to height of proximate building which is higher than the hotel is a rare thing (room 219 - recommended). Check-in was easy and courteous. Next, the beds were the opposite of what we found at Hilton H and T; beautifully comfortable yet firm, with lovely linen and even (rare in US?) a covered comforter. Like someone said in an earlier review - there was definitely a temptation to stay in these beds and order room service! What particularly impressed me, in addition, was the (unexpected) levels of efficiency and service in this hotel - it's clear that they are prioritising customer care. As an example, I reported a toilet which was not flushing properly: within an hour (in my absence) the fault had been rectified, and a card confirming this was on the desk together with a small box of belgian chocolates to apologise for the inconvenience. I have never encountered such swift and thoughtful service - even 5 star hotels can be a let-down in this area. The hotel also made follow up phone calls just to check everything was OK. Need I say more - this is rare indeed! Don't bother though with the Big Downtown - bit drafty and very limited menu - we kicked ourselves because there are so many other, better places nearby which we discovered afterward. By the way take the Blue Line to this hotel - the Wabash exit from the L station is literally 30 yards from the hotel's Wabash Street entrance. Much recommended. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel - it was a great experience; we moved to the Blake Hotel for a further 3 nights, which is a different, boutique hotel experience - but service and comfort wise the Palmer House was perfect.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201csmall rooms\u201d", "Author": "Bessca", "ReviewID": "UR6158041", "Content": "typical Hilton room; but they are smaller then I've ever seen!

Oh, wait...you could rent a fridge for $30/day!) There was bottled water in the room if you wanted to pay FOUR DOLLARS A BOTTLE for it. The service for the conference was rather poor...coffee and hot water for tea were often out, dishes were left sitting, etc. The Downtown Cafe food was ok, overpriced, as would be expected, but DON'T sit outside...right under the El, and so loud! Also, they have a \"beer tower\" drink, which is literally a giant tower of beer. As one can imagine, it is popular with your stereotypical wannabe frat boys, who also like to sit on the patio and dispense shots into the mouth of whoever walks by...while the staff looks on (even though there are regulations in Chicago against alcohol leaving the marked premises). The service was polite enough but slow, and when you're at a conference, promptness is important (especially when you'll be spending the next five years waiting for an elevator!) Overall, the lobby is OK (in Europe no one would look twice), but you could come in and peek at that if you wanted to.

Pros: 1. 2 blocks form the Art Institute of Chicago (Museum) 2. 2 blocks from Millenium Park 3. 1 block from the L 4. One of the absolutely best locations for shopping or eating as so many venues are within walking distance. 5. Stellar professionalism from those who work in the hotel 6. Walking distance to the free Trollys that will take you to Navy Pier and the Museum of Contemporary Art. 7. The men and women at the concierge desk were (with one exception) all very helpful and knowledgable about the city. 8. If you don't like talking to people, there is also a digital concierge w/a touch screen where you can do anything from checking your flights to making reservations. Cons: 1. The room I was given was small. The reason (promptly explained to me by the desk agent) was because I booked through Priceline - though, I know how the game goes since I've worked in a higher end hotel in the past - not a big issue to me. 2. There was a charge to use the fitness center. 3. No free wifi and actually, no wifi at all - the hotel is still wired through LAN. 4. ** This isn't the hotel's fault, but I could barely get any reception with my cell from anywhere within the hotel. All in all, the Palmer House was really a wonderfully convenient place to stay. My deal is that I only use a room to sleep in, so the size wasn't that big of an issue. The bed was only a full sized, so if you're a bigger person then it might not suit your needs (or, if you are a larger couple). I am pretty convinced that you cannot beat the location.

We checked-in well before the posted check-in time and had no problem getting into our room. The bell staff efficiently and politely held our luggage on our departure day since our flight wasn't leaving until later in the day and much past the check-out deadline. The room was nicely appointed, including a very large closet that had plenty of hangers and room for our luggage. The room was clean and had more than adequate space and good lighting. The bathroom, however, was very small. I don't think I've ever seen a smaller hotel bathroom, but at least the shower was not one those horrible \"low flow\" devices, and the shower head was mounted high enough on the wall that I didn't have to bend to get under it (I'm 5' 9\" and I have this problem at other hotels that are supposedly \"upscale\".) The bathroom was also extremely clean and well maintained. The beds are very comfortable, and the HVAC worked just fine as did the hair dryer and iron. The hotel includes a shopping arcade on the street level, and all of the employees were exceptionally helpful and friendly without being intrusive. Room service prices are on the high side - even for a big city hotel. I recently stayed in New York City and San Francisco and found lower room service costs so I'm not sure what the reason was for the escalated prices since the menu items were the usual fare. However, room service is an optional service so this doesn't make any difference in my opinion of the hotel. The swimming pool was clean and well-stocked with towels at all hours. It is not a zero-entry pool and must be entered either from stairs or via typical pool ladders, and the depth goes to over 8 feet so those with children who are not strong swimmers must be careful as there is no rope to denote the rather sudden drop from the more shallow depths to the deep water. The hotel is in a great location, and has nice rooms with great service.

The staff were very accomodating and allowed me to check in to the room at 11 am and even upgraded me to a room with two bathrooms. Unheard of anywhere else I have stayed at in Chicago!

We always felt like we were a top priority to the staff on every level, from Room Service to Concerige. The room was impeccably clean and beautifully furnished. The beds were so comfortable there were days we debated just staying in them and ordering room service all day. The lighting, windows that opened (to a safe height) and all the extras were an added bonus. The Palmer House - who knew of my friend's birthday - even sent up a tray of cheeses, fruits and the most delightful chocolate confections as a surprise for her (and I was surprised as well as I had not ordered it for her.) One day we walked in from a day on the town and voila!, there it was in the room. At the Executive Tower section, bottled water, snacks, juices, coffees, teas, and the like are yours all day for the taking. The bar on the 23rd floow is open from 4 pm to 11 pm. Yes, drinks are expensive, but then this is not the Comfort Inn or the local tavern. The Concerige on the 23rd floor was very, very accomodating...everything from restaurant reservations to getting a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to the room prior to my picking my friend up from the airport and returning. The express elevators to the Executive Level rooms (21 - 23rd floors) were very convenient. My friend works out, so she loved the fitness room - very vast and a wide variety of machines.

An opulent lobby does not equal a great hotel. My first impression was of a huge Travelodge with a posh porch.

This is not an uncommon occurence, apparently. Proms, conventions and general teenfests abound at Palmer House. We were told that our room - which had been booked several months in advance - was not available. We would have to spend the first night in a broom cupboard situated directly beside the 20-something elevators, with noisy neighbours evident through the paper thin walls. Needless to say, we complained ever so politely (we are Brits, after all) and were given some vouchers for the restaurant as compensation. The room was tiny with a great view of a fire escape and alleyway. The noise of elevators/teens in the room was so loud we decided to have a drink to calm our shattered nerves. No mini bar. And a charge of $3.25 for a small bottle of water. So we went to the bar in the hotel - very expensive for Chicago - more like London prices! And a grumpy bartender to match. No matter what time of day or night it took 15 minutes to get from room to lobby or back again, as the lifts were either not working or constantly busy with teen 'delegates' from Japan, Peru, France etc. Nightmare. The next day they moved us but after a struggle. We couldn't be moved first thing (fair enough) but were assigned a room that would be ready for us anytime after 1pm. We were also told we'd have to move our own luggage, for 'security reasons'. We returned at 3.30pm to be told the room still wasn't ready, but finally spoke to someone who knew what he was doing and got us fixed up within about 10 minutes, luggage and all, in a quiet, spacious room (view still of an alleyway though!). On the plus side, the location is very central. It's clean. And they have nice bathroom products. And the food in the Downtown restaurant, although pricey, isn't half bad.

We have just returned from a week at this Hotel and felt disappointed.

Ceilings were stained in a number of areas. The poorly designed bathroom meant there was only about 12\" clearance between the opened door and the lavatory seat, so trying to manoeuvre while closing the door required vertical limbo dancing skills that I have never possessed. I assumed that the reason we had been given a room subsumed in gloom that overlooked the opposide side of the hotel was to avoid the noise from the El which runs parallel to the Hotel. It meant that very little natural light could enter the room and led to feeling of profound depression. Each day we returned to the hotel as late as possible, as we just did not like the stygian gloom. Holes in the bathroom walls from previously connected apparatus made the uncomfortable tiny room look even more scruffy. The prices for services could not be justified we felt.

Our room was very large with two very comfortable beds and two bathrooms though one bathroom was on the small side. The room was spacious enough that we were able to fit in a roll-in cot. The room was very clean and nicely decorated with ample furniture, but we did run out of electrical outlets to plug in laptops, digital cameras, and cell phones, so bring an extension cord if you carry many devices. The a/c, iron, tv, coffee maker, and blow dryer worked well. I paid extra for the fitness center which was well equipped and staffed. The hotel is centrally located near everything other than the baseball ballparks and the magnificent mile which are only a subway ride away.

Much has been said about the lobby but even so I wasn't prepared for just how gorgeous it was (and trust me, I'm not the kind of person who gets excited about hotel lobbies!) Check in was quick and smooth and our room lovely. Some posters have described the rooms as basic, but that was not my experience. Maybe we fell lucky (we booked in England through our travel agent, rather than on Hotwire - so probably paid full rack rate) but we had a large corner room with two double beds. It was furnished traditionally, not elaborate but not basic either. The beds were exceptionally comfortable. The bathroom was adequate but nothing special, but came with Crabtree & Evelyn shampoo etc. which were replaced daily. The location of this hotel is excellent. Some posters have indicated that they would prefer to stay in the Michigan Avenue area near the Magnificent Mile, but I would disagree. The Palmer House Hilton is so convenient for public transport (the loop stops are directly outside one door, the red line outside another) that I don't really see the advantage of staying elsewhere. True, the loop feels a little deserted at night, but it felt reasonably safe. It is just a short walk to the hotel from the blue line and were able to get to and from the airport without relying on public transport. There is an excellent Corner Bakery next door to the hotel, which we used for breakfast most mornings. One tiny quibble relates to the Concierge facility. I wanted to get tickets for the Cubs and on the first night spoke to the Concierge who tried to get tickets but the website was down. The following morning another we asked another Concierge to help us out but he clearly couldn't be bothered and gave us the box office phone number. The same evening we went back to Concierge no 1 who booked the tickets for us immediately - so if you use this facility the evening guy is better than the daytime one! All in all an excellent trip.

The room was small, but we've had much smaller rooms (such as the Hudson in NYC). The walls were a little thin but noise really was not a problem. The bad news: the bed, one double bed for the two of us. This was really bad news as I'm 6'4\" 220 and my wife is 5'9\". We were shocked when we walked in the room and saw the bed size, and pretty miserable when it came time to sleep. While we've encountered rooms with only a double bed in Europe before, we had never experienced this in the US. We called the front desk and asked for other options (a king, a queen, or two doubles?) but were told because this was a Priceline room, there was nothing they could (or at least, would, do). After two nights of horrible sleep in the double, they finally offered us a bigger bed on Sunday night. A single doublebed for two people just is not acceptable, at least not in my book.

It does have a great lobby, and the rooms are clean and well maintained. I travel all the time for business and what matters to me is service - and while it's adequate at Palmer House, it's not what I expect from a hotel in this class. For example, I went to work out in the gym dressed in a t-shirt and exercise shorts (the nylon kind) - the attendent asked if I was dressed in workout clothes - I thought the question was odd, but said yes. Then she asked me if I was wearing Jeans - I did raise my eyebrow in disbelief, looked at my shorts and said \"no\" - she then said \"Are you giving me attitude?\" When I complained at the front desk, the clerk said she was going to get a manager - she didn't. Instead she called the attendent, who apparently said she had to check attire. In fairness, the front desk clerk did give me a coupon for free access to the center (it's an extra charge) - but it was pretty clear it was more to make me go away than being sincerely apologetic for the attendents inappropriate comment. The internet access was down the entire time of our stay. When we asked about it at the front desk, the clerk just said \"it's down.\" No apology, no idea when it was going to be back up. I look for hotels with in-room high-speed because of my business - not having it is a real problem. Again, the attitude was more irritating than the problem. I had driven there with a colleague and the parking was supposed to be on his room. There were no charges on his room bill so he assumed he would pay that separately when he went to retrieve his car. When he went to pick up the car, the attendant was upset with him that the parking had not been paid for. Eventually the attendent let him pay right there - but the attitude was much more that it was my colleague's responsibility to make sure his room bill was correct. Again, at this class of hotel, I don't expect to be treated that way. I usually stay at the Wyndham Chicago on St. Clair (near Michigan Ave.), but couldn't get a room there for this particular weekend. They have much better customer service and larger rooms.

We got the room for about $116 per night (including taxes) for two people. I was really worried about what we were going to get for a room after reading some of the reviews; but, I was hopeful that my Hilton Honors Card would come in handy, as one reviewer indicated it would. Well, it did. There is a separate check-in for card-holders, and the clerk immediately indicated that we would be upgraded to a room with two bathrooms (boy, did that come in handy). The room was very large, giving us a lot of moving-around room. It is an old hotel, but it has been modernized to the point that it is comfortable enough for the rate. We stayed on the 13th floor, Room 265. Someone previously indicated that finding the room was very confusing. We had no such problem. The bathrooms in our room were quite adequate, not real small, as someone previously indicated; but, they are designed for one person at a time. Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel was nice to us, and helpful. The pastry-snack shop on the ground floor came in handy every morning for breakfast with our in-room coffee. Our coffee maker didn't work the first time we tried to use it, so I called someone, and it was replaced in 15 minutes. A complimentary USA TODAY newspaper is at the door of every room every morning. The elevators worked fine -- no long waits. This is a huge hotel, so there were three separate entrances/exits onto three different streets. The Red Line Monroe St. train stop is right outside the hotel. The Blue Line train stop is one block away (this takes you back and forth from O'hare Airport). We bought the 24-hour train/bus pass each day for $5. They can be purchased at the Osco Drug Store that is on the same block as the hotel. Using the train to get to/from O'hare is a steal at only $1.75 per single ticket one-way. We bought individual tickets at the airport when we came in; but, on the way out, we had time left on our day pass. Now, for the negatives. The beds were way too soft for my taste. I did not get a good sleep on any night. I don't think they are soft out of neglect; I think someone purposely selected that type of matress. What leads me to say that is, the other aspects of the room (bedspreads, sheets, pillows, curtains, towels, etc.) were of high quality. Why, then, would the matresses be neglected? The water pressure in the shower was terrible. I complained to the main desk, and they apologized and took note of my complaint for future reference. I was somewhat puzzled by the \"noise factor\" in the room. On one hand, we never heard anyone talking in the adjoining rooms or televisions blaring. On the other hand, we could hear very clearly people in the adjoining room hanging up clothes in the closet (like they were doing it in our room). Hallway talking and other noises were also very clearly heard in the room. Running water from other rooms was clearly and loudly heard. Although the noises were astonishing when we heard them, they did not occur often enough to disturb our stay. Maybe we just lucked out, and it really could have been a lot worse with the wrong type of people in the adjoining rooms. At any rate, we were satisfied with our stay. I can envision, however, how things might go terribly wrong for someone in this hotel. There is definitely potential for a lot of negative. I would recommend this hotel to Hilton Honors Card members.

My room was on the eigth floor, and I was first directed to the wrong set of elevators due to unclear instructions given at the front desk.

I entered the room, only to find that the air was stifling and hot. I also discovered the interior of the room could be viewed by those at the indoor swimming pool, as I was changing clothes and noticed movement. I went to eat at the Trader Vic restaurant in the complex, and was told, even though it was ten minutes before closing, that they would not serve any more meals. After finding an altrernative for dinner, I returned to a hot and musty room, despite the fact that I had left the AC running while I was out. After finally getting into bed, I discovered that the mattress sunk down to the level of the box spring, and that it was lopsided regardless of any efforts to get it to be level. Considering that this room was about $160.00 for the night (with taxes), and the reputation of Hilton Hotels, I would have expected much better than what I got.

I am sure the hotel was not full during my stay so why ? When you're in vacation like I was, travelling from far, you expect for more care. At the Palmer House, apparently they don't... care. I will never forget that.", "Date": "November 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnsville, MN", "Title": "\u201cOld World Elegance\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2825308", "Content": "We stayed at the Palmer House Nov. 5th through the 8th, 2004. You could not ask for a better located hotel. I learned from the info book in our room that the Palmer House is the longest continuously operating hotel in North America. For it's age, the hotel holds up remarkably well. I loved every facet of the hotel. The best way to visit Chicago is without a car. Driving in downtown Chicago isn't worth the risk and parking is expensive. The roads are a free-for-all. Cab rides are always an adventure as it is. And always look before you cross streets. Red light running is routine. The Blue line \"L\" from Ohare is easy to find. Just follow the \"Trains to the City\" signs. It drops you off a block from the hotel at the Monroe St. stop. Conversely, on the return trip, just make sure you go down the Blue Line subway entrance (there is also a Red Line) and hop on a clearly marked train to Ohare. There is also an Orange line elevated train to Midway Airport, with a stop a block from the hotel. Best $1.75 you'll ever spend in Chicago. Once you emerge from the subway it is a little intimidating as you are immersed in a dense sea of skyscapers. It is just a matter of orienting yourself. Read maps to familiarize yourself with the cross streets. Don't be afraid to ask someone if you get turned around. You may encounter beggars, but a polite sorry is all you need to say, if anything. Keep walking. They won't bother you. Once you get to the hotel, it is again a matter of getting oriented in the cathedral-like lobby. Check out the ceiling mural, painted in 1900. The Windsor Bar, just off the lobby, is a great place to hang if you are waiting for someone. They have world-class cigars for sale, big screen plasmas and a Golden Tee 2005. The only drawback is the long walk to the other side of the lobby to the rest rooms. After you check in, take some time to familiarize yourself with the hotel. It takes up an entire city block and has exits to at least 3 of the surrounding streets. You could spend your entire stay without leaving the hotel. There are 3 on-site bar/restaurants in addition to the Windsor, which serves appetizers and free snack bowls they put out that you won't be able to stop munching on. There is a Starbucks-type coffee shop on one of the buildings' corners, and the real thing a block or two away. There are several retail shops in the hotel and on the back side of the building there is an old fashioned mom and pop breakfast diner. There is a Walgreen's nearby and a White Hen, which is a little pantry with several types of coffee, pastries, deli sandwiches and typical convenience store wares, about a half block away. I used the internet access in the hotels' business center to print my boarding pass for my return flight. Make sure you tell the staff you are printing a boarding pass. It is a flat rate of $5 versus $9.50 for 15 minutes of access. If you are an HHonors Gold member, be sure to find the elevator to the 23rd floor, which requires you swipe your key to access the floor. There you will find a free continental breakfast in the morning, free pop and water all day, internet access, free snacks in the evening along with a private cash bar. Millenium Park is a block away. The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium are a long walk or short cab ride away. Ditto the Sears Tower Skydeck. The \"L\" and Red and Blue subway lines are a block away. Anywhere you could want to go in Downtown Chicago is either within walking distance or a short taxi ride away. Taxi rides are another story... This is not the place to stay if you are on a budget. Food and cocktails are spendy, but then that is life in the big city. If you are coming here for a once in a lifetime splurge, this is your place.

I heard many others complaining about the same thing. Actually, it was usually the topic of conversation while waiting fo elevators. This one killed me. The fitness area is an extra charge to hotel guests!!!!!! They want to charge you $10.00 a day extra when you enter the fitness area. You can use the pool free of charge, which is very small for a hotel that size. Finally, I really did expect CHicago to be expensive, but the hotel eateries and bars are unbelievable at $6.00 for domestic draft beer and $8.50 dollars for a mixed drink, not to mention the bar staff was a very rude bunch.

Trader Vics and French quarter fall into the very average food very high price category - $60+ for a dinner and drink. Downtown Chicago is vaguely reasonable - $25 for dinner and a beer, but again the food is unremarkable and pretty bland. Best meal of my 4 night stay? - wings and a philly cheesteak from roomservice, a snip at only $30!! If the company is paying, it's fine. If it's my dollar, there's certainly better for less.

Each property also has positives and negatives which are NOT the result of timing. Here are a few for the Palmer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Cons: * Some of the rooms are quite small. Many of the older style bathrooms have little standing room. * Because it is a historic property, some facets of the hotel will show its age. * Because of the dense urban location (no fault of the hotel itself), you can expect the following: even self-parking is expensive; only the top rooms facing the street have any views; beggars are common. Pros: * The location is indeed excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to transportation, tons of restaurants & shops, theaters, the lake, Grant Park and Millenium Park, the museums, etc. * The beds are wonderful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down-filled toppers both above and below the main sheets. * Not just the main lobby, but all of the public spaces are beautiful (for example, check out the grand ballroom). Tips: * Before booking your stay, become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hilton HHonors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd member. There are some perks including a separate check-in desk. * Request your room preference before you arrive. * If your room preference can not be guaranteed (as with Priceline), arrive early on your check-in day to request it in person. * Before booking, check with the hotel regarding any overlap with major event dates (such as conventions). * Leave a note with your tip for your maid. * If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an option for you, visit without a car. * As with any hotel, avoid the mini-bar.

Our dog is trained not to bark in these situations, and we didn't hear any other dogs barking during our stay. A few notes on the hotel: Not a lot of rooms with a \"great\" view... realize you may overlook a parking lot or directly at another building across the street. The lobby is magnificent, but the rooms don't reflect the elegance represented there. It is a great location if you want to visit \"The Taste of Chicago\"... easy walking distance to that event.

The location for the hotel is excellent, 5 minute walk to Madison Square Garden, 20 mins to Central Park, 10 mins to Time Square. Supermarket and pharmacy only a 5 min walk up 5th Avenue, perfect. Found the room to be quite spacious for New York City, we had seen some of the reviews before going over and were expecting it to be alot smaller than it was. Nice walk in robe with a safe, had a desk and a lounge chair, and bathroom was small but convenient. My fiance had emailed before we went over and requested a fridge in our room, with a reply that one would be provided for our stay free of charge if one was available. (we thought being the slow period over there that there would be no problem), when we arrived in our room there was no fridge. We went out to get some dinner and went past the front desk to ask if a fridge was available and the guy was quite nice about it and by the time we got back to our room there was one there. There was one problem with our stay though, we had been out exploring the amazing sights New York has to offer and had done some shopping and got some lunch and were pretty keen to go back to our room and relax for a few hours before going to a NBA game, went to put our key card in and it wouldnt work, tried it a few times thinking we were just putting it in too quickly but it still wouldnt work, so my Fiancee went down to the front desk to see what was wrong only to be told that we had to check out, he was a little suprised at it was only day 8 of our 13 night stay?! After the man from the front desk telling him that we had only checked in for 8 days, my Fiancee replied with \"im pretty sure we have checked in for 13 nights, I can get our travel documents but they are in our room, would you like me to go get them\" the gentleman replied with \"oh no no its okay ill just go check whats going on\", he came back and provided him with 2 new key cards for the rest of our stay, very appologetic for the incompetence of mr non excitment. The only other problem we had was that because the hotel thought that we had checked out, once we got the new key cards and got back into our room we put the lock on the door as we do with any hotel room we stay in, and house keeping tried to come in the room. Not there fault at all as they were only coming to clean the room as they had thought we checked out, so we just explained what had happened and she was very understanding. All in all, a good budget hotel, great location, despite what other people on here have said, we didnt have much street noise, I think what some people forget is that it is New York City so it never stops, so expecting to stay in the heart of the city and have no noise it crazy.

The muffins and tea/coffee in the morning were a perfect start to a busy day, the only issue would be that there is not ample seating for everyone depending on what time you go down for the muffins. I would definitely return to this hotel and would recommend it. The only negative was the air conditioning was a little noisy but after a busy day out in the city we were to tired to hear it!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Wight", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable hotel within easy walking distance of sights and station\u201d", "Author": "SandyIsleofWight", "ReviewID": "UR121024889", "Content": "Large comfortable, quiet room with separate seating area which was handy for husband who is an early riser.

About the only positive for this hotel is that it is located within a convenient walk of the Empire State and other mid-town attractions. The side-street that the hotel is located on is dirty and not at all attractive and the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the hotel is very unimpressive. Not what one might expect from a property advertised to have period appeal. That said, the hotel owners have obviously put a significant effort into maintaining the period look of the lobby area, which was very ornately decorated and attractive. A character that has unfortunately not been continued through to their reception desk, which looks more like something from a budget two star establishment. As for the rooms, those that we experienced were small and poorly maintained, with tired d\u00c3\u00a9cor and furnishings. In fact, our room had an air-conditioner that sounded as if it was going to rattle out of the window frame, which easily drowned out the surrounding street noise below and was impossible to sleep through. There were also visible stains on the carpet and ceiling. The bathroom shelving was thoroughly rusty and covered in layers of dust and had to be replaced during our stay. The ceiling of the bathroom was also covered in dilapidated panels, which were in need of some attention. (SEE PICTURES) Also, be warned, everything at this hotel comes at an extra cost. It'll cost you $1 to make a 1800 free-phone call from your room, which is higher than the 60 cents/min they charge for local calls. No free wireless connection and what is on offer is very highly priced and not of an executive standard. Luggage storage consists of coin operated lockers that are not big enough for large suitcases, although the front desk will begrudgingly store these in their back room if you ask. There are also none of the standard coffee and tea making facilities one might expect from a hotel of this class, not even on request. We were simply told that coffee and tea would be made available in the lobby at breakfast time, which consists of nothing more than a few stale muffins. This hotel may have been a proud example of a three star hotel in it's time, but unfortunately those days have long since passed and the current management seem more interested in profiteering than maintaining service standards. We absolutely regret staying here and would most certainly not recommend that future travellers look elsewhere. If you're looking for budget, the Holiday Inn provide a far better standard, at a vastly cheaper rate. If you're looking for charming d\u00c3\u00a9cor and a period feel then you better camp in the hotels lobby, as this is the only visible evidence of any historical note.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falmouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice traditional hotel\u201d", "Author": "Finbarjc421", "ReviewID": "UR113936222", "Content": "Great location and nice hotel.

No restaurant or bar in this hotel but they do provide muffins and tea or coffee for guests each morning. The muffins were delicious and fresh and several flavours were available. It would have been nice if some water or fruit juice would have been available for drinks though. The hotel is not on the main road which was better as this made it a little quieter if your not used to the noise of the city. The view from our window was very limited (the building next door) but to be honest we didnt spend a massive amount of time in there (why would you - its New York) anyway. Come out of the front of the buiding though and look up, the Empire State Building is right there and about a 2 min walk away. Location wise the hotel is ideal. It takes no time at all the walk to Times Square, Central Park or any of the other amazing attractions available. There are plenty of restaurants around the area to find decent food, but then you are so close to the centre that it doesnt make much difference anyway.

The location of this hotel is really what you are paying for. Our room was basic but clean. Not fancy, but realistically we just slept there at night. Some of the reviews we read complained that the room was too small. But we found that it was fine - especially because we kept all our suitcases in the large wardrobe so it helped keep the room feeling more spacious. The bedding was very comfortable. Our only complaint about the room was the shower. It could be a little temperamental and it took a while for the hot water to start. Sometimes the water temperature would suddenly become very hot or very cold. The tap handles were a little stiff, but we found that if we really turned them hard, we could adjust the temperature back to a good level. The only downside about this hotel was the front desk staff. They were not friendly at all and were actually quiet rude - except for the young guy who worked the late night shifts. He was very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is very ornate inside and really feels like a turn of the century building. Just lovely. Also there were free muffins and coffee in the morning which was great. The hotel has a coin operated laundry which is very helpful. Whilst it doesn't have a restaurant, it is directly across the road from Ayza wine and chocolate bar. It's a great little place, very popular. We recommend the white truffle pizza! Yum!!

The room they tried to put us in first was a complete disaster. It was tiny, barely room to step around the bed - which was hardly bigger than a single - I know we were on honeymoon, but come on! The ensuite was not an ensuite, it was a wet room, hardly big enough to turn around in, and you had to step though a closet to get to it. I was unimpressed to say the least.

My Husband went down to see what he could do, because if I'd gone, little miss smirky at the front desk would have had her day escalated from Bad to \"Worst of her life!\" in seconds. He came back with two room keys, the first he told me not to bother with, he knows me so well.

I've noticed a couple of other reviews on here also say the same. We did complain about it but the heating wasn't on. This was during the snowstorm as well so it was freezing outside. The floors and the walls felt very hot so it must be from the pipes. Throughout our entire stay our windows were open constantly and only then was it just bearable. The decor was extremely old fashioned but I think this is probably part of the charm of the hotel which is over 100 years old. The bed was comfy and big. The bathroom wasn't too impressive as it didn't look very clean (the sort where you want to keep something on your feet so your skin doesn't touch the floor!). We got little sample bottles of shampoo and free soaps. Having said that it it could just be where the bathroom was so old - I didn't want to look too closely!

Check in was uneventful apart from the most miserable face EVER behind the front desk. I perservered with my charm and eventuallyher face cracked out the slightest of Mona Lisa smiles..... The lobby is quite ornate but it stops there. Th room was very basic but clean. The bed linen was crisp & clean & the mattress looked new. (I checked on my paranoid quest to check for bed bugs! I didn't find any bugs either...) The shower was almost impossible to get to the right temperature and occasionally the water stopped flowing altogether for several seconds at a time which was distressing with a head full of shampoo. Our toilet blocked and overflowed but this was dealt with swiftly. The heating throughout the hotel is ridiculously hot, we had to put the aircon on in November! There are clanking, hissing & gurgling sounds intermittently throughout the night, I presume from the aged central heating system. In the morning they serve tea, coffee & various muffins for breakfast which were tasty. Went down a treat with the teen. The best bit about this hotel is the location. It's a stones throw from the Empire States building & Macy's. We walked from the hotel to Times Square as well. The taxis run on a meter on the way back to the airport and the roads are often gridlocked so because we had time & subway tickets over we walked to nearby Penn station & got on the A train that goes almost all the way to JFK airport. The driver tells you which stop to get off at then it's $5 for the airtrain. The whole journey took os 1hr 35min from the hotel to airport but I'd allow at least 2 hours in case you get lost.

There is a Walgreens store where you can find bottled water as well as a lot of snacks and if you need something more specific, there is a Duane Read store also very near, both of them on the 5th Av. The hotel Staff is really helpful and polite, they helped me with my delayed luggage and also with the booking process (on line). The rooms are nice, in my opinion, there is enough space for two - three people in a twin room and the best thing is taht you have a bathroom onside your room, so no need of sharing! Another really good thing is the the Wolcott hotel offers complimentary coffee, tea and delicious muffins (cranberry and blueberry are a must!) every day, so it's a great way to start your day exploring the city. Also, the hotel is near NYC Penn Station, so if you arrive at Newark, the hotel is just a couple of blocks walk.

The reception staff were very friendly and when our toilet broke on the second day it was fixed by the time we returned from site seeing (5 hours later) and when i reported the fault there was no issue in getting maintenance up to the room. A complimentary breakfast is on offer. Its served in the main lobby of the hotel so was slighly awkward coming from the 12th floor and back up with two coffees and muffins. The muffins had varirty and fresh. But if muffins are not your thing then a dunkin dounuts and other outlets are just across the street.

The suite was small but clean as was the bathroom. We did not expect anything fancy and therefore were not disappointed with it. We did not spend any time in the room except to take a shower and sleep anyway. The suite had a t.v in each room but I have no idea whether they worked because we never switched them on.

First impressions: nice area, central, literally down the road from Macys and a clean and rather grand reception area. BUT....WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE WAS ALREADY 2 OTHER SCHOOL PARTIES THERE so be warned....it is a favourite for large youth groups. I was in a room of 3 and immediatley through the door there was a bed. There was then a bathroom and a doorway to the large room with 2 beds, a tables, t.v. and dressing tables. Prehaps not the newest and modernest interior but it was clean. The bathroom was smallish with a bath/shower toliet and sink but it was satisfactory and had been cleaned. The hotel does offer free coffee and muffins in the morning but due to the large number of school groups, i couldn't get near it. Honestly though, the tales about bed bugs and cock roaches are rubbish. our room was throughly cleaned daily and towels and laundry were fresh and clean. I am a hygine freak and honestly had no issues. Location wise, i think its difficult to beat. Macys it literally a strole away as with the empire state. A 10 minute walk to time square and easy access to subway stations. Just round the corner is a superb 24hour breakfast place called SPEEDY'S. It is actually brilliant anc not too pricy. It does self seleection cooked breakfasts, continental as well as frozen yougharts smoothies and all beverages imaginable. I got a bagle and large juice for under $5!!!! Its great. The hotel also has a shop connected to it, accessable from inside the hotel so water can be picked up cheaply at the start and end of each day. View wise, only the front rooms get them but for me, it was not a big deal as i could walk out of the hotel and be anywhere very quickly. A friends room has a broken lavatory, when they returned after a day out, it had been fixed. Didnt interact alot with the staff but all seemed pleasant, and willing to help. They organised a room to store out suitcases during the day as we had a night flight. Honestly though, im a fussy teenage girl and i thought i was absolotly fine and definately clean && anyway, when you in New York, you have to be pretty sad to spent alot of time in the hotel. our days were so packed and we were so tiered it was literally a place to wash, sleep and change. Especially if you are going here on a school trip take my word it is fine and clean and actually rather a nice surprise. And also last time i went to nyc ii stayed in the embassy suites (part of the hilton chain) in lower manhattan with my parents so its not as if i dont know whats nice and whats not. There were also locks and latches on every door and a safe in every room so there was never a time when i felt unsafe with my friends or on my own within the hotel. enjoy your trip:) x", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat City but not a great hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Midor", "ReviewID": "UR47981632", "Content": "The only good thing about the Wolcott Hotel is its location close to many otf the tourist attractions,the hotel is old, noisey and in dire need of a makeover,If you intend to go to this hotel make sure you take earplugs as the walls are paper thin and vibrate when the room doors are shut,seems like many guests take delight in slamming doors at 330 in the morning.

The bigger issue was the shower. The water would either randomly stop flowing (or reduce the flow to a trickle) or it would become extremely cold. Adjusting the hot and cold usually resulted in another burst of cold water or being scalded. If I had been staying longer this would have been more of a problem.

We stayed in room 1124. When we got to the hotel and opened the door to our Junior Suite that had 2 rooms, my first impression was that it was way too small but since it was the best price in Manhattan that I could find and an awesome location I wasn't upset. After all we spent little time at the hotel. There's always something good and something not so good about each hotel and though I was completely satisfied with Wolcott I wanted to share some things with those who are looking for a hotel in NYC. Had I known some of those tips I would have brought conditioner with me. :) What I liked about Wolcott: 1) Great location. It's very close to Empire State building on one side of the street and to Penn Station, Macy's and 5th Ave on the other. For the lovers of Korean food there's lots of Korean restaurants on the 32nd St right next to the 31st St where Wolcott is located. There's Subway & Dunkin Donuts on the other side of the street from Wolcott. 2) Has 2 TVs in Junior Suite, one in each room. Has one queen bed in one room and 2 twin beds in the other (one of the beds is a roll-away bed that is hidden underneath another bed) . Junior Suite has 2 closet with plenty of hangers. 3) There is an iron and a safe in the room. 4) They have coffee and several kinds of muffins for breakfast in the morning. (There's not much room in the lobby to have breakfast so we always took our breakfast to the room). 5) Towels were changed daily even when we didn't leave them on the floor. 6) There's a tour agent in the lobby from 8am to 8pm that offers great one day trips to Washington D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. I went to Washington D.C. and Boston with them and absolutely loved the tours. 7) The sheets were clean and beds were very comfortable. And now some things that could be better... 1) There was only shampoo in the bathroom. No conditioner or shower gel. 2) There was no coffee maker in the room. 3) No fridge in the room 4) The hotel doesn't have a pool and I don't think that they have a gym either. 5) The air conditioners in the rooms were not working well. I always had mine at 75F but you had to keep in on all night to get the room temperature to 75F by morning and they turn air conditioners off during the day so it gets warm in the room. 6) No free high speed internet. The only free internet I found in NYC was on 5th Ave (near Times Square) in an Information Center but you can only use it for 15 min and the lines are always long there. Overall, I did like my stay at Wolcott and if I ever go back to NYC I'll definitely stay here again since the location is great and their prices are unbeatable.

Situated on West 31st Street the Wolcott Hotel is specifically geared towards tourists. The operating principles of the management team appear to evolve round the fact that they are within walking distance of Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all they need to do. We stayed in a Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite for 7 Nights in December 2008. The 2 rooms were large enough but basic. Why they felt the need to supply a TV in both rooms and yet no facilities for making tea or coffee is strange to say the least. The coffee and muffins supplied in the lobby at breakfast time are nice but come across at an attempt to appease the otherwise general lack of facilities that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d assume were the norm these days. On the day we checked out we checked under the drawers of the dresser to see if any of our clothes had fallen behind. There was a substantial selection of other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underwear that appeared to have been there for some time which was probably indicative of the room service standards. The taps in the bathroom leaked, the heating was noisy, the bed not particularly comfortable and bathroom extras were kept to an absolute minimum. One reviewer described the hotel as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcShabby Chic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure where the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bit came from. One final word of warning to anyone thinking of booking this hotel. The original quote for the stay omitted the three different taxes that are required for hotels in the city. This added a further $50 a night onto our already overinflated hotel bill. In summary there are much better hotels in New York in this price range and although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely go back to New York we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be staying at the Wolcott.

The rooms are small but that is common with hotel rooms in NY, the one downfall was the air conditioning, it didn't work very well and gave out a weird smell. To be honest if your site seeing and shopping etc you are hardly ever at the hotel and it literally was a place to sleep. The staff on reception were great and very helpful, you also get free coffee and muffins for breakfast. The Wolcott is in a brilliant location, right by The Empire State Building! I didn't find the concierge helpful at all, I tried to book a few tours with them and they told me the tours I wanted were fully booked, this also happened with tickets to a Broadway show, however I managed to get the tickets from other places myself. So watch out for that one! If you are a student then definatly bring your student card as you get tickets for a quarter of the original price. I saw The Little Mermaid for $30, the original price of the seats were \u00c2\u00a3160. Another recommendation is to take the Greyline bus tours as you get to see the whole of Manhattan with a great tour guide.

They also have \"lockers\"downstairs where you can secure small belongings prior to check-in and after check-out for $1. There is a free Continental Breakfast, but it was too crowded for me, so I went to \"Jimmy's\" (fast service and good food http://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants.php?id=301570# ) around the corner on Madison. There is also a great French resturant, Serge, a block up on Madison. Take a walk down to 29th (Park/Madison) to have a drink at classy Red Sky (http://www.redskynyc.com/default.htm). Finally, my room had three twin beds, which work out nice for a family. The Bad: This is an older hotel that has had some updates so don't expect a deluxe bathroom. The elevator is slow and small and I don't particularly like standing body to body with strangers. The front desk staff was grumpy and there is no express check out. This hotel seems to get a lot of tourists so I would not recommend for a business traveler. Stay at the Vinici Avalon nearby. The Ugly: It appeared that the one twin bed had not been changed. Now, I grew up on a farm, so there is very little that bothers me, but the bug that I saw in the bathroom in the middle of the night was the last straw. Looking more like a beetle than I roach, I don't know who wsa suprised more - me or it. Anyhow, I kept the light on and did my handicapping the rest of the night.

Itself being visable from some of the rooms, i contacted the hotel beforehand to request a room with a view and it was carried out. The look of the hotel is as grand as their website suggests, unfortunately the heating is either too hot or not on at all so if your planning to stay there take some nice warm pyjamas. The windows do not keep out the noise or the cold, however the bed linen and towels were all clean and changed daily(despite the claim they like you to use your towels as much as possible to save the environment, they were pretty much changed every day). The lifts were slow, but again were spotlessly clean and well kept. The reception staff are very polite, all except one who spoke to me as if i were the village idiot and quite blatantly commented to other staff on the size of our baggage although it had nothing to do with him as we moved it around ourselves! He spoiled what was originally going to be a positive review of the staff. Mid way through our stay we were visited by a mouse, he appeared in the room and helped himself to our Indian Take Away left overs. We contacted the reception desk who told us they would send someone up to deal with it, over an hour passed (I didn't particularly relish the fact i was sitting in my hotel room when i should be outside exploring the city) my husband called reception again and was told Housekeeping would deal with it. Simple as that. No offer to move us out of our room, no apology from the management or incentive not to come back and tell the world and his wife that the Wolcott has a mouse infestation. I had noticed towards the end of our stay an American complained about the price of his room to a member of staff, he clearly thought the standard of accomodation should be higher for the price(i personally thought it reasonable) and after she had a lenghty discussion with him justifying the rates a hamper was called for and subsequently taken to his room as a little sweetener. Maybe we should have been a lot more stroppy in our mouse incident and then we too may have recieved the complimentry hamper. Now as for the hotels surroundings, there is a Dunkin Donuts at the end of the street, the coffee there is disgusting but the doughnuts aren't too bad. There is also a very posh restaurant jus accross the street which is rediculously over priced. If you venture out of 31st Street and head towards the Empire State there is a Starbucks and just a little further a place called Heartland Brewery where i reccomend the NY Cheesecake(Best i've ever tasted)!There is lots to do within close proximity of the hotel so you cannot beat its location. A small tip though, contact the hotel and arrange for their shuttle bus to pick you up on your arrival at the airport, it cost us almost $80 to catch a yellow cab by the time we paid the tolls and his tip and only $48 plus a tip to get their shuttle bus back. We wish someone would have told us this before! In all this hotel is great, I just hope you don't get a visit from a mouse, that a particular staff member is off during your visit and your not a light sleeper!", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carlow", "Title": "\u201cReally impressed\u201d", "Author": "PearlCarlow", "ReviewID": "UR11546463", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in December 07 and found it amazing.

I woke up the 2nd last morning and went to the bathroom and my 2 eyes were terribly swollen and I had bites all over my arms and legs. However I was more worried about my eyes as they looked dreadful. I had to go to the doctor as I was worried and thought I needed an antibiotic and pharmacist advised that i should get it checked out. so went to doc and he diagnosed bed bugs. Now he said lots of hotels have them so this is only 3/4 of my problem with the Wolcott. I went back and showed reception and the manager my eyes. Reception seemed shocked and could not understand how it happened. The manager came down and spoke to me and said they had no problems like this in the hotel (what a load of crap)...he saw what a state I was in with my eyes and still denied everything. They apparently got pest control in and went through the room and found nothing (what a load of crap) The injection the doc gave me ($80 later) took most of the day to take full effect but I will never forget how I was treated in that hotel I have never been treated so badly.

On my way down on the train from Connecticut, I saw an add in the Amtrak magazine that if you used the \"booking code\" in the add that you would get your room for $169. When I called I was told that they only had a few rooms left so they could not honor my coupon!!! There was nothing in their add that said that. Since I was booking late (same day) I went for the room as $190 still was within my budget. However, I was further upset to find that my room had NO security lock! I had to push my bed in front of the door for security as I was traveling alone (and I had made that clear when I booked my reservation which, by the way, was told it was non-refundable since I was making it at the last minute.) I was also given a smoking room, complete with ashtray. Lastly, the air conditioner was SO noisy that I had to wear my ear cancelling headphones to bed. This air conditioner was as loud as the back rows of a jet liner - even on the lowest setting. I had to keep the air conditioner on as the room was tiny and heated up quickly with the New York summer heat. Since I had arrived late (after 9PM) I decided to tough it out and complain in the morning and ask for some sort of partial refund.

I stayed there because a friend of mine from Osaka Japan was there for an art gallery showing of promising new artists. He is Japanese but was the interpreter for the other 9 people as we went from gallery to gallery with their work. They selected the Wolcott because many young Japanese, not knowing any better recommended the place. I had my own room, a twin bedded room with 2 chairs in it. My friend and one of the men artists were on an upper floor also with a twin bedded room. The first incident was when I went to their room- there were no chairs. I called the front desk and asked them for chairs. Several hours later, a disgruntled worker came with 1 chair and said that was the best he could do. I went downstairs and brought up a second chair from my room. One afternoon (we stayed 4 days) we went out and upon coming back, my Japanese friend asked for his room key which he left at the front desk (I had mine- I always carry my room key)The first thing out of the snotty clerk's mouth was you can't have 3 people in a room. There are only 2 people booked in this room. Being a Philadelphia I snottily replied that I have my own room, my own key and for him not to be such a snot-nose. No further comments were made except to have the friend's key slammed on the desk. I found the hotel to be a dump, full of foreign travellers who don't know better that they could have had a much better place to stay in had they done some searching for the same price. Often times, recommendations, as evidenced here are spotty. One thinks a place is fabulous, others think it is horrible. I thought the Wolcott was a dumpy place for the money. The good part though is its location, its close to everything New York and has lots of reasonable places in the nieghborhood in which to eat including Korean restaurants. It snowed while we were there and our clothes got wet from the sleet. The nice thing was that we could put everything in the dryer in the basement and clean up our clothing from snow and sleet.

The room I had both times consisted of two huge rooms. One room had two twin beds with a TV, desk and closet, the other room had another twin bed with another TV and a safe as well as the bathroom. In my view this was a big room for Manhattan or any other big city for that matter. We didnt have a view either time...I dont know how you get rooms with a view but I didnt complain, I could walk right out and look at the city myself. The hotel has a concierge who can help make reservations to get to the airport or to go to the Statue of Liberty or something. The lobby also features a small convenience store. Also something very helpful for my family and I was the hotel has a parking agreement with a garage on W. 32nd St (right around the corner) where I was able to leave the car off for 3 days with no worries).

The only negative aspect of the hotel was that their lifts/elevators what have you are ancient and were often under repair, but they have \"back up\" elevators. But the real gem of the stay was the neighborhood -- when we arrived, there was a Polish parade about to occur down 5th. Magica! There is an attached bodega to the hotel that was crucial when I came down with a little cold. There are close, very authentic New York cuisines nearby: Joe's Pizza, Pho32 in the Korean District one or two streets up is an unbelievable pho shop. On the opposeite corner of fifth and a block up, there is a bodega/breakfast/sandwich shop that has a window that faces fifth -- lovely way to start the day.

The heater is very noisy (I have had old heaters before - these are not typical noises); the clock radio picked up interference from something and made loud noises pretty much every hour and the only way to fix it was to unplug it.

My room -- one of the two-room mini-suites, was on the ninth floor. It was quiet, clean, very comfortable, and the bathroom was modern, reasonably large and absolutely immaculate. There were lots of fluffy towels and when I asked for more washcloths, they arrived promptly The beds (one queen and one trundle daybed) were fairly new and very comfortable, with plenty of good quality pillows and blankets. The suite had two tvs and two phones, all in good working order. The in-room safe worked fine after I studied the directions, and it was large enough to hold my laptop computer. No fridge, but this is probably a good policy to discourage people from leaving food around, which draws bugs. (I saw no evidence of a bug problem, by the way.) Lighting was okay -- not-too-ugly overhead lights in each room, plus bedside lamps for the queen bed, and a desk lamp by the daybed. Decor of the room was fine though not deluxe -- nice wallpaper and bedspreads, though carpet was a bit worn. It would be nice if the windows had sheer curtains in addition to the drapes, so you could let in light without giving up all privacy. The hallway was attractive -- freshly painted and papered and reportedly about to receive new carpet, which had not yet arrived. It appears the hallways on some lower floors have not yet been re-done. I myself had no problems with hot water for showers, though I did notice that the hotel seemed to run out of hot water for a short time after peak usage periods -- so if it's possible, plan accordingly. The room got a bit warm for my taste when the building's heat was cranked up but that was easily remedied by opening the windows for a time. There were two fairly new AC units (one in each room) that I did not use except to test them out to confirm that they worked and were not unusually noisy. My room was on the back, with a view of the airshaft, which made it very quiet even with the windows open. As others have noted, the lobby breakfast consists only of coffee and an assortment of muffins but it's free, good quality, and plentiful.

The prices are much cheaper than other accommodations in this area and in my opinion you get a good deal for your money. We stayed in a junior suite and it was a large room, the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. The bedroom area had a tv and closet and there was another room with couch, tv, two chairs, desk, telephone. The ensuite was a good size and the shower water pressure powerful - it took a few seconds to get the temperature right but that is not much of a hassle is it! We had no view from our room - but you did not come to look out the window anyway did you? We had a view of a brick wall and the room did not let in much light - this however did not bother me for one minute - we got up in the morning and did not return until night when we went straight to bed. Ignore complaints about the lift in other reviews - they were fine some people might think a wait of less than a minute at the most for a lift when the hotel is fully booked is onerous but I am not one of them. I dont know about \"bugs\" as some others have commented on I can just say that I never experienced this at all. The hotel provides coffee and muffins every morning, each room has a safe, hairdryer, iron and clean supply of towels and bed linen each day. I did not have any dealings with the staff other than on check-in and check-out but found them to be friendly and helpful. Large lockers are provided for storage of your bags if you are leaving after check-out - just 50cent. If like me you are looking for good value accommodation that has everything you need and is in a great location, you wont go wrong. However, if you are looking for 5star accommodation but are only willing to pay 2star prices you will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, Somerset", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, clean and good location\u201d", "Author": "Joney-Blett", "ReviewID": "UR5921206", "Content": "I had read a lot of reviews of the Hotel Wolcott before I left for my 4 night stay in September and was a little worried about what I would find because of the mixed reviews and because NY is notorious for expensive but below par hotels.

Although we had no view out of our window this meant that we weren't disturbed by street noise and we were generally very happy with our stay. The lobby is fantastic and we made use of the complimentary breakfasts - be warned though that very large parties or students often stay at the hotel and consequently if you arrive for breakfast when they do there is very little left until supplies are replenished (which is often). We only had one problem with the room and that was the in-room safe - DON'T BOTHER TO USE THEM - they frequently go wrong and although the handyman was very prompt in helping us out the safes are unreliable and lock you out and refuse to accept your password.

We were confident through reading other reviews that even though the rooms were tiny, it was an affordable, clean, and comfortable choice. They were also one of the few hotels that offered twin beds. We checked in on the evening of September 28, 2006 and found our room to be just as we expected very tiny, the closet wasn't even deep enough to accomodate a clothes hanger! We decided even though the cleanliness didn't meet our standards, it was pretty typical for a hotel and we could put up with it for a few days. We quickly unpacked our belongings and hit the streets in search of a restaurant for our late dinner. We were exhausted after a long day of travel and much walking, so we went to bed pretty much as soon as we got back to our room. The next morning, my daughter noticed a bug on her comforter and she immediately new what it was...a bedbug! I squished it in a kleenex and it was full of blood. We were too afraid of what we might find so we didn't tear our beds apart to see how many other visitors were there, but I did see a chigger next to my pillow! We quickly packed our suitcases and checked out, advising the girl at the front desk about our discovery. The hotel manager wasn't in yet so we locked our suitcases in a locker and left for our morning as guests of the audience for the Martha Stewart Show. After lunch, we returned to the hotel to speak with the manager. According to her, the maid found the room to be infested with bedbugs and she invited us to her office to check our bags for hitchikers. We didn't find any, thankfully, but we were still very grossed out by the whole situation! The manager called Orbitz and we weren't charged for our 1 night stay, the following nights were cancelled, and we weren't charged a penalty. According to the manager the hotel has an exterminator come in every Thursday and spray each room.

The front desk staff that we encountered during our stay were also very pleasant. However, that said, the shower in our room was really terrible. It is possible that this because we stayed on the 11th floor and this hotel is around 100 years old. I think this shower was even worse than those of the many cheap hotels I stayed at in China (although it was cleaner). Sometimes the water would just stop in the middle of the shower, but most of the time there was just very little water pressure. Sometimes we had to wait several minutes to get any warm water at all. We thought about asking to move to another room (preferably on a lower floor), but we decided to just live with it. Another \"con\" at this hotel is the air conditioning unit (at least the one in our room). It didn't keep the room very cold at all, and in fact it felt humid in the room even with the air con set at \"super cool\". It can also be very loud and annoying at times. Yet another downside to this hotel is the lack of even a small refrigerator in the room (not to mention a microwave). We always prefer to have a refrigerator to store drinks or snacks in, and we have found them available in most budget hotel rooms in New York, but not here. So, we had mixed feelings about this hotel, but we feel that the \"cons\" outweighed the \"pros\" overall.

The Staff..Wonderful..no complaints what so ever..helpful in anyway. Ok now for the Slow,crappy, and haunted elevator..NO just kidding..but I tell you almost every review I read before I went to NYC to stay at the wolcott said that something was wrong with the elevator..but So not true on my exsperince in it. Yes..the elevators were sort of slow..but that's only because they were working on puting the other new one in so it took a little bit more time. But most likley before you go..who's reading this..they'll be done by then. So that's that.

The rooms are huge and very nice..I LOVED the bed and the little couch in the other room that was very comfey. And my favorite channel was E! (just for some fun info.) The very little I watched it anyways..lol. So enough of that..on to the attractions near by..empire state building is 3 blocks down..just like a lot of reviews say..and Time Square..umm..all say it's about a 5-10-15 min. walk..just depends on how fast you walk, if you stop places, or etc. But for me it just seemed as if it took 2 sec. to get to time square..I geuss I wasn't paying to much attention to the time..lol..but who would. There's pleanty of places in the morning to go for breakfest if you don't want their muffins in milk. As in places to go..duncon dounuts..which is right across the street. Or you could walk a few mins. away and go to a near by starbucks coffee and trust me..there is plenty of those.

Noise from the steam pipes, which kick in at around 5:30 every morning, is another story - you will be woken.

I paid $200/weekend night and $120/weeknight. My room was clean and the linens looked and smelled fresh. The furniture and TV appeared to be newer. The bed was comfortable too. The carpeting had a few wrinkles. I could view the top 20 floors of the Empire State Building from my window. There was a walk-in closet containing a safe. The bathroom was clean but small. The sink was one of the tiniest I had ever seen. A small shelf hanging above made it difficult for brushing teeth without bumping my head. My only other complaint was that it was very difficult to adjust the shower's water temperature. There was plenty of hot and sometimes scalding water, but it literally took me 10 minutes to get it to where it was comfortable. This is despite having the same style faucet at home! There was a 20-30 second delay between faucet adjustments which made it very frustrating when trying to get the correct temperature water flowing out of the tap. The hotel's location was very convenient to shopping and the subway at 34th st. Unfortunately, the Transport Workers Union decided to strike about halfway through my trip, bringing most public transportation to a standstill. Luckily, the hotel is still in the center of Manhattan (east to west). Walking 28 blocks to the southern edge of Central Park proved to be do-able for someone in his early 30's, but tiring. There were only a couple restaurants on the same block, but it was still easy to find a place to eat by walking another block in any direction. There are normally two passenger elevators. One was being renovated. It appeared to be nearly done the day I checked out. The other one was slow, but I got around this by walking downstairs every time and only took the elevator when going up. Morning breakfast consisted of about 4 types of muffins, coffee and tea. Everything was good. If you like a bigger breakfast, there are nice cafes and diners within a block. A Dunkin' Donuts is across the street.

There is a restroom off the lobby, but requires a key to access it...this was a pain. Several people off the street were coming in to use it (there was a parade that day), so it was hard to keep up with the key. The Concierge was a new girl, and was no help.

First of all they couldn't find our booking and when they did it was a twin room not a double. I had specified a double in my booking but as it was explained to me was basically 'like it or lump it' The lobby is stunning but as you go up in the tired and tiny lift you begin to find the hotel's true colours. The halls stunk and were nothing better than what you would find in a YMCA. The room was awful and the door would have blown over in one breath and it was paper thin. The only good then was that the bathroom was clean.

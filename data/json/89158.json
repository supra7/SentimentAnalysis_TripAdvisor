After Katrina, it tried to return to its former state, but never really got there. Now, for the first time, the hotel seems to be back, delivering my best stay in years. It all starts with Lauren, who contacts you before you arrive for any anticipated needs. She has been great help in requesting the perfect room, ordering flowers through the concierge for my wife, and even recommending a running route up St Charles. However, your stay really begins at the front door, and this hotel has the best doorman in the city. David is fantastic and always remembers our names, cars, etc. He is truly amazing and I hope the hotel realizes what an asset he is for their returning guests. Check-in was a breeze and our room was ready at arrival - beautiful Club Level Full Suite. We prefer the --01 rooms, as they are at the end of the halls, offer river views, and are configured well with many windows and light. The renovation of the bathrooms in the past year has made our stays even nicer. Before, water pressure was an issue, but this is improved substantially. My wife wishes the hair dryers were of better quality (the ones at the Roosevelt are the same as she has at home), so she just brings her own. The Club Lounge does a good job. I still think the NOLA Ritz Club is a little better with regards to food quality, but it is hard to beat the great river view and outside seating areas. The staff there was pleasant, as usual, and tries to help as many guests as they can. My only real criticism, as noted by other guests, is housekeeping. The daily service is fine, but the turndown seems highly variable. Sometimes the curtains were closed, other times not. Sometimes towels were replaced, and other times not. It seems like water should be left behind - at least in the Club level. If there is a checklist that the staff should follow, then they are not doing it. We had breakfast daily in the Grill Room, preferring it over the Club Lounge. The homemade granola and hashbrowns were among the favorites of the weekend. Checkout was great with a correct bill. The final goodbye was to our friend, David. We'll be back soon.

Food on the Club Level is well done and you would have enough to eat and drink all day w/o spending another penny (not that you'd want to do that in NO, but it is nice not having to go out for brkfst every day or having a casual glass of wine and snacks mid-day between day and evening activities).

Over the last year, every room we have stayed in has been completely renovated--this even includes the hallways. The WC definitely has gone through a growing and renovation period BUT not only is the WC fabulous they are also in the process of adding a beautiful SPA and a NEW pool (now compete). YEAH! One of our favorite parts of the WC is the Polo lounge. Best cocktails and service in the city: REALLY! Roger is known for his creative drinks as well as for just an awesome glass of champagne. If you know Nola, you know this. Music, cocktails and friends--it is not so loud and crowded that you can't have a great time with friends. We love that it is a get-away weekend place that is located close to lots of city action or we may not leave the hotel all weekend. The Grill room is also an excellent place for breakfast and/or dinner. Ask for a spot out by the windows :) FYI: They are VERY pet friendly. Our little dog, Fred loves the WC.

The entry courtyard to the Windsor Court Hotel is lovely. The entance to the lobby is beautiful and you are greeted with the signature floral arrangement of 12 dozen beautiful roses. We arrived very early and stored our bags with the bellman.We reserved a full suite with 2 queen beds. There were only king beds available at the time we arrived. We explored the Riverwalk and French Quarter, had lunch, and returned at around 2:00. Still no room. We sat and relaxed in their beautiful lobby. 3:00, check-in time, still no room. We take a deep breath and continue to wait. At 3:45, still no room. At this point, after getting up at an insane hour to arrive at the airport for a 6:30am flight, we are tired and very unhappy. A bit more time passes and we are upgraded to a club level suite. This instantly makes up for the wait. The bellman meets us at the elevator and escorts us up to the 21st floor with our luggage. We are given the lay of the land as well as the hours for the club lounge. He filled our ice bucket and called for a rollaway bed so our children could sleep in peace. The suite was gorgeous. The entry had beautiful parquet flooring. To the right there was an entry table with lamp and a mirror on the wall. To the left was a granite topped wet bar area. the bar held mini bar items as well as a Keurig machine with both coffee and tea selections. The living room had 10 ft ceilings, and was furnished with a large sofa, 2 chairs, coffee table, 2 end tables, a writing desk and chair, a 42\" flat panel TV, a marble table with 2 chairs. There was a floorplant in the corner and a plant in a pretty silver container on the table. There was a cordless phone on one of the end tables. The carpeting was in very good condition. The drapes were very pretty. There was an unfurnished balcony off of the living room. The color scheme was very soothing and warm. French doors separate the living and bedroom areas. The bedroom also had a 10 ft ceiling and was furnished with 2 queen beds with a bench at the foot of each and pretty wood headboards, 2 dressers, a nightstand between the beds, and a 32\" flat panel TV. There was a large bay window. The blackout draperies are well done. There was an iPod dock/alarm clock and phone on the night stand. There was a dressing area with a sink, granite topped vanity and chair. The area contained a good sized closet with a laptop sized safe, iron and ironing board, and some shelving. The ceiling drops down to 8 ft in the dressing and bathroom areas. The bathroom may be entered from either the bedroom or living room. there was a vanity with a single sink, granite counter top, and some shelving. There was a vase with a black calla lily matching those found throughout the hote, There was a door at the entry from the living room and a pocket door leading to the dressing area. Another door lead to the wc and bath tub/shower. the tub surround and walls were tiled with marble. Marble flooring ran throughout the bath and dressing areas. There was a scale in the bathroom. The club lounge was on the 22nd floor and had lovely views. There were 2 outdoor patio areas. The continental breakfast and evening appetizers were set up very nicely. There were cocktails in the evening. We were not around for the afternoon tea service. There was a concierge desk in the lounge and Diana was very helpful. There was a flat panel TV and 2 computers. Wonderful artwork on display throughout the hotel. The pool deck just reopened a few weeks ago. It is a lovely area. The pool heater was out of service during our stay. We did not utilize the spa.

Perhaps my expectations were a little high. The rooms and hotel in general are nice, comforatable, and clean. The staff is pleasant. However the service leaves a lot to be desired and the hotel is technology challenged. Some of the problems we ran into: - The TV was fuzzy and the wireless connection was so low that we couldn't keep a connection. - The hotel was kind enough to give us another room (and moved our luggage for us), but gave us a room that wasn't quite as nice (a little smaller, desk didn't have plug in or AV connections, motel 6 soap instead of the nice soap in the previous room, etc. - nothing major just a slight down grade). - The second day there we came back from a day wandering around and found that they didn't clean the room. We had booked the cleaning to be between 2 and 5 pm as we planned on sleeping in - somehow that translated into not cleaning the room (it did work the next day) - On the third day we came back and found there was no toilet paper. We called for someone to bring some, but after an hour no one showed up. - The kids wanted to watch a movie on the second night, but the Hotel doesn't have any type of pay per view or netflix capability. We were going to connect our computer to the TV, but our new room didn't have the connections our first room had. The staff did't know where to look for cables and said they would find some in the morning (not a lot of help when we have kids wanting to watch something before bed). The staff did look the next day and got the cables that were in the previous room. - The rooms are dark, but did have a reading lamp. However there are no plugins near the bed to use it. That didn't really matter as it didn't work. We swaped light bulbs with another lamp in the room to get it to work (but only turns off by unplugging it) - The concierge was very helpful in getting us tickets for a river boat jazz cruise. However when we showed up, we found that he didn't give us the proper paperwork. We still got on, so it wasn't a big deal, but could have been if the river boat was fully booked. - The room has no plug ins near the bed or easily accessable by the desk. We had four computers, four iphones, and a few cameras to charge - but no place to plug things in. Most lower end hotels have already figured this out and provide connections. - Wireless is free, but you have to log in after each time you turn off your computer or leave the room with your phone. A minor thing, but still a pain that most hotels have figured out. - The tub felt like I was standing on a layer of soap scum A few good things: - We needed spoons for ice cream we bought on the way back to the Hotel and they brought them. - We forgot sunglasses in our car and they went and got them - We needed help finding a cruise and the concierge found one for us", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cBabbaloo\u201d", "Author": "Maxmo1", "ReviewID": "UR126209684", "Content": "My wife,children and I have stayed many times at this great property.

I stayed on the 21st floor of the Windsor Court so we were able to take advantage of the club level experience. It was nice to be able to go to the club level for a light breakfast or if we didn't want to eat there we could get a voucher from the front desk to eat in the dining room and have the value of the club breakfast deducted from whatever we ordered in the dining room. We would also head up to the club level every night to have complimentary drinks and appetizers before heading out for the night. Our room was very spacious, two queen beds, a bathroom and then sort of a powder room outside of the bathroom so more than one of us was able to get ready at the same time. I loved the complimentary mini scones we were given at breakfast in the dining room and if you go for tea time you'll get a few large ones there, they were better than any I've had in NYC so far. The hotel offers a 3hr tour of New Orleans twice a day and we did that on our first day. I would say its worth the time and the money if you know very little about New Orleans. We took the trolley to Parkway Bakery for Poor Boys and the fried shrimp one was extremely good, towards the end I just ate the shrimp because it really didn't need all the fixings. The trolley is very slow at least in the French Quarter area because it stops at pretty much every block but once you get further away it can be faster. My favorite meal was at Bayona, I had the crispy quail salad and the lamb loin. I would also suggest going to August and going somewhere that offers Sunday Jazz Brunch. As far as jazz goes, we went to Snug Harbor jazz bistro on a night Charmaine Neville was performing and boy was she bad. When we arrived we took a seat in the back of the first floor in case it might be took loud upfront as its not a large venue. When the band opened they sounded great and we thought we were going to have a great night, they had Davell Crawford on the piano for the opening with one of his songs and he had everyone into it. Then Charmaine got on stage and put a damper on the night. She did one song and then said she heard there was a bunch of student volunteers from Newbury College in the house and that one of them was a singer. She went on a rant about how we need to nurture the young folks in music and made the audience member come on stage, he asked if he could bring a friend and she said alright. She then started a song and had them sing the same words every now and then but you could tell they were uneasy. She then wanted him to choose a song and sing it for everyone so that took a while because he had to try to think of something they might know how to play, luckily they decided on a gospel song but he didn't know all the words and warned he would just stop when he needed to. I don't know if he was nervous, which you could tell he was, or if he just isn't as great a singer as someone told Charmaine. His girlfriend that he had come on stage with him had a better pair of lungs than him and Charmaine, I almost wished she just performed because her voice caught your attention. After they were finally allowed to head back to their seats Charmaine went on a rant about god and even a local next to me said \"come on now, I already went to church on Sunday, I want to hear some jazz\". He had all of us laughing and I found him more entertaining throughout the hour and a half than Charmaine. Her next song involved her opening a bag full of small instruments like a tambourine, cowbells, maracas and I don't know what else. This is where I was glad we were sitting in the back because she started handing out these instruments to the crowd and having the people come on stage. There was at least 7 audience members now involved and everyone was strumming to their own beat. It was like a circus and went on for so long that the audience members involved were less enthusiastic about it by the minute. Charmaine finally did a solo act for about two songs and then invited her son onstage and wanted us to support us song on Amazon that's titled something like \"New Orleans, Hot\". It was a rap song about New Orleans and by that time there might have been 15min left of the show because people would need to start coming in for her 10pm show. We left while her son was still performing in hopes to find some real jazz and thought we would checkout the Spotted Cat until one of us realized we lost a credit card and had to head back to the hotel to cancel it. On a different night we went to Irvin Mayfields which was a nice spot and it's free, I would try to get there on a Wednesday when Irvin performs. I almost forgot to mention the beignets at Cafe du Monde, they are worth waiting for and they are open 24/7. We went on a Sunday afternoon and only had to wait about 5min for a seat and its really cheap. There are a bunch of places to eat in the French Market I would check out, when I walked through I wish I didn't have different lunch plans. What I also enjoyed about the area of the French Quarter is there are a number of musical street performances that you can stop and listen to. I would like to go back with friends as opposed to family to check out more of the scene on Bourbon St. at night, it's nothing special during the day.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat spot\u201d", "Author": "PimlicoTram", "ReviewID": "UR125763665", "Content": "I fled here from the woeful Doubletree next door.

It had a skeleton staff and no room service and only a buffet for meals but we were warmly welcomed and made to feel at home. For over three years, until we bought our new vacation home on the Mississippi gulf coast, we stayed at the Windsor Court on a fairly regular basis. We loved the W.C. then and we still continue to consider it our \"home away from home\" whenever we go to the \"city.\" Our most recent visit was during Christmas week 2011 and our one night stay was much too short. The hotel, which is undergoing renovation by its new owner, has retained all of its wonderful ambiance. A before or after dinner drink at the Polo Bar is still one of my favorite things to do on a visit. Our suite on the 14th floor had been remodeled and it was beautiful, comfortable and luxurious.

If you are planning to attend a conference at the Convention Center and would like to feel like royalty, there is no other place to stay in New Orleans but the Windsor Court Hotel. Shopping? The shops at the Canal Place and Riverwalk Mall are few blocks away. Fine dining? The Windsor Court Hotel has one of the best in the city - The Grill Room. A block away from the hotel you will find August by Chef John Besh. Things to do? The Aquarium of the America and Insectarium are also few blocks away. Gambling? The Harrah's is a across from the hotel. You will also find the New Orleans Trolley a few feet away.

There is a butler's pantry in our room. The bed is comfortable, and there is enough space for our clothes. For the ladies, there is a make up table. There is no bath tub in our room, but who would like to use one where everybody else had laid down in it and scrub their body. The shower space, however, is wonderful, and the water pressure is the best I have seen in any other hotels, considering our room is in the 16th floor. There is no problem getting the hot water. The towels are soft, and they provide Molton Brown in the bathroom. Overall, the room is fantastic, they did a wonderful job in remodeling the rooms. TIP - Call housekeeping if you would like your room clean right away. This alone separates this hotel to any other hotels we have stayed. Regarding the facilities of the hotel, the gym is adequate to what you would need in your daily workout. There is enough machines and free weights. Towels are provided. The pool is currently being remodeled, but I am sure it will be grand once completed. In conclusion, the Windsor Court Hotel truly deserve the Four Diamond award. It is the best hotel in New Orleans.

I gave value a 4 because it is not normally that cheap but based on the rate we paid I give it a 5. Valet was the normal $35 but they let us keep the car in the garage as long ss we wanted the next day no extra charge There was one downside I noticed. It might have just been the location of this particular room, like I said this was our first stay so I can't judge on any other suites, but the noise from the party patrons on the street was really noticeable from our bed. We were on the eleventh floor and I could hear entire conversations. Yes those conversations were being yelled at the top of their lungs just to clarify.

This has the makings of being a very nice hotel. The staff were friendly and the location is great. The room I was in was very large. I have traveled to many hotels over the years which range from a Holiday Inn to Villa d'Este in Italy. In all my time I have never experienced what this hotel is doing. They are trying to improve the hotel quality and I do applaud their attempt. However, they are also hedging their bets that guests will not complain too much to maximize the amount of work they can do in a day and still bring in as much revenue as possible. I just checked out today of room 405. When I originally checked in a few days ago I was never asked for any type of room or smoking preference. Apparently when you call to make reservations they warn you that they are doing some renovations on the \"pool.\" This just happens to be on the floor they put me on which is or was a smoking floor. (I am not a smoker). I can deal with the pool renovations. However, what they strategically neglect to tell you is they are also renovating many other sections of this property. This includes the room directly above mine. I woke up just before 8am on the first day to what I can only described as a wrecking ball sound on the ceiling right above my bed. I thought I was having a nightmare and fully expected the ceiling to be cracked and caving in. I promptly got up, showered, and left the room and didn't think about it much more. However, I got back to my room around 11:30pm that night and couldn't believe they were drilling and sawing still right above me. I tried to ignore it but after about 20 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and contacted the front desk. The person that answered was nice and said that this should not be happening and told me they would take care of it and call me back. Well, everything finally stopped about 25 minutes later just before 12:30am and I never got a call back. In the morning it all started again around 8:15am. I tried to turn on the TV to focus on some other noise but the remote power did not function and so I gave up (my room has older TVs so I assume it had not been renovated yet). I showered, packed up everything, and checked out. I was asked how my stay was and at that point I brought up my experience. The front desk attendee was nice and apologetic but couldn't explain to me why they would occupy a room right below the construction. I got the impression (although it was never directly confirmed) that many others have complained about the same thing. Needless to say this is not a common practice at a 2 star hotel nor should it be one at one trying to be at the rating the Windsor is going for. I doubt I will ever stay here again based on how my situation was handled and the fact that they knew exactly what they were doing when they placed me in this construction zone. I know others have commented on this before and I read another review that indicated a RItz Carlton would typically give at least two floors buffer between renovations and rooms that are occupied. Last night I would have been happy with just one floor buffer. Windsor Court Hotel you hedged your bets with me and lost. I hope that others can read this warning and avoid my nightmare. Apparently this same thing happened to at least another one of the guests in our party earlier in the week. They complained the next day and were moved to a higher floor.

The hotel is close to some great restaurants (Mother's for breakfast, Bon Ton for lunch or dinner, John Besh's August for an upscale dinner) and the impressive World War II museum, too. The hotel bar is lovely, and serves an array of interesting cocktails. If you are planning a trip to New Orleans and you want comfort, luxury, a friendly welcome, and a great location, the Windsor Court is an excellent choice.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cSmall hotel feel at large venue\u201d", "Author": "SFGreg", "ReviewID": "UR120339312", "Content": "Very upscale, boutique hotel well situated between Convention Center and French Quarter.

Seriously, this is easily the best hotel experience I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. We stayed in a junior suite (renovated), which had a wet bar, sitting room with balcony overlooking the river, large bedroom with another huge window on the river, separate dressing area with vanity, and marble bathroom with a large shower and separate WC. Other amenities included two flat-screens with HDTV, and a Keurig coffeemaker. The room was stunning. Expensive? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on par with other quality hotels in NOLA, but there are three differences that were important to me. First, the customer service is above and beyond. The concierge had booked a service for me, and there were a couple of glitches that were not in any way the fault of the hotel. However, the concierge not only comped the service, he sent a complimentary cheese and fruit tray to the room as an additional apology. (Thanks again, Adam!) Room service was prompt, the food arrived hot and delicious. Anything I requested (bucket of ice, extra creamer for my coffee, etc.) arrived with 10 minutes. These folks are serious about service. Not only is there evening turndown (complete with either chocolate or pralines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yum!), but they fill your ice bucket and set out your slippers (provided compliments of the hotel) and your robe. The room was spotless when we arrived and housekeeping does a pretty good job. They do miss a spot here and there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think our wet bar area went several days without being wiped down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the bathroom is kept spotless and the towels replaced daily. The toiletries are top-notch spa quality, and while we did have to request refills when we ran out (as opposed to having housekeeping monitoring for that), when we did request they were replaced immediately and in double quantity. The second thing that was important to me was proximity to the French Quarter. We stayed over Halloween, and while I wanted to be close enough to have fun, I also wanted to be far enough to have a retreat when I needed it. The Windsor Court is ideal in both respects. Just a block or so off Canal, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk to anywhere in the Quarter, and the nights were blessedly quiet (and that includes no noise from the air conditioner, which I used every night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I like my room cold). You will hear the whistle from the ships on the river and the occasional traffic noise, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a much quieter street than Gravier (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this close to the Quarter). Noise from other guests was minimal as well. As for the construction, yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening. But I worked in my hotel room every day until noon, and never once did the construction noise interfere with my concentration. Let me reiterate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I stayed on the 16th floor, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on floors 12-15 and on the pool, which was outside my balcony and down maybe 12 floors. Sure, I could hear it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not that much noise (and anyway, who besides me is going to actually stay INSIDE their hotel rooms in the Big Easy?). I was up between 6 and 7 each morning and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember them starting before 9 or so. Finally, my favorite difference about the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really one I was actively looking for; the folks here are not just interested in serving you, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in YOU. When I walk through the lobby, I say hi to Antonio the doorman/bellman, Adam at the concierge desk, Kyle behind the check-in desk\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and they know my name. They know me well enough to laugh together, to ask how this or that restaurant or activity worked out. Sure, not everyone behind the desks is gregarious and vivacious\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all friendly and polite and ready to help. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a business executive or a high roller, just a high school teacher from Washington State. They care about their customers here, and you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find that much anymore. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel highly enough. Try it and see.

I can't imagine why (except for price). Yes, the Windsor Court is expensive; however, it's well worth its price when you want to feel completely relaxed. My room was incredible. Separate living area, small balcony, large bedroom, and big bathroom with separate room for sink and another separate changing room with another sink. The club room (if you take the added splurge) is again well worth the expense. It offers a great series of sitting areas (inside and outside) overlooking the city and the Mississippi River. Plenty of snacks and drinks. On the weekend, eggs were made to order. All included in the price of the access to the club floor. Room service was delicious (having ordered a soup and Caesar salad) and prompt. Drinks in the Polo Lounge every night was elegant. The bar staff was amazing. The next night the staff immediately remembered all of our drinks which is the sign of an attentive and professional staff. People are a bit dressed up (not casual, no shorts and t shirts). The fitness center is a bit small and lacking the necessary or expanded equipment. Overall decent, but considering the hotel is first rate with everything it does ... it could be better (what can I say they set the bar high for themselves). The floral arrangements are stunning (this coming from a guy whose family owns and operates a garden center). Staff is all accommodating and friendly. Our first night had the hotel not have water available from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM. I think the 11:00 PM shut off was a bit too early. I know these things can't be helped sometimes but it's inconvenient and surprising. Considering the price (which wasn't discounted off rooms) the hotel should offer a discount without having to be asked (which we did and received). Some light construction started at 8:00 AM! That's a bit crazy considering New Orleans is NOT an early city. Everyone is generally passed out at that time and nursing a hang over later. Not sure how the hotel could justify banging on the walls at that hour. It wasn't full on constant construction but it still was something that jolted me the first morning. Room service is the only thing which I really take issue. The rooms are immaculate; however, the staff will knock early in the morning to try and make your room (if no do not disturb sign is posted and then came back to some of our rooms but not others). With turn down service I turned away the housekeeper around 5:00 and she never came back. Same or the next day. I didn't think much of it but then another in my party said when the housekeeper walked in their room to do turn down service, they were told if they didn't get it done at that moment they were going home and not coming back to do it later. Understood but you're paying over 400.00 a night and I can't believe they just don't say ... if you still want turn down service call housekeeping later. I thought the comment was a bit out of line with how the hotel operates but the room service seems to be spotty. We waited until after 4:30 PM on a Wed because housekeeping was not able to clean the rooms (we tried to check in at 2:00 PM). So there does seem to be issues with housekeeping but when they clean ... they clean and do a great job. It seems to be a drawback but let me state the hotel is fantastic. It just stands out because the hotel is such a class act and stellar place.

The first day I experienced it at noon, and again at 3pm- so I chose to relax by the pool instead (which was closed halfway during my stay for renovations). The most disappointing day of my stay was the last day where I was actually able to sleep in, but was awoken by hammers right above my head at 8:30 in the am. I understand the hotel is under renovation, but I emailed the concierge ahead of time who explained that the only inconvenience would be the closed pool. I also called the front desk to complain about the hammers and they said they would try to do something about it, but it went on for at least another hour so needless to say, one cannot sleep through such a disturbance. I would not recommend staying at this hotel for a leisure vacation if you want to be interrupted by power tools during your stay. I'm sure everything will go back to normal after the renovations, but I don't think the Windsor Court should knowingly book rooms near the renovation process. One other note is that when I was reviewing my bill, there was a $200 bar bill from the Polo Lounge.

We were originally booked in a standard room but were upgraded to a renovated Club Level room (Thank you Windsor Court Management!!!) due to ongoing renovations in the hotel. I was very nervous about the room we would have gotten based on all the reviews saying how worn the older rooms were but our room was so brand spankin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new that it still had that new carpet smell. The room was not huge but tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds and a large marble bathroom. I do hope once the rest of the hotel is upgraded, the prices won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go up because although our room was lovely, I absolutely do not think it is worth the amount they are charging. In addition, I found out after my stay that there is complementary breakfast and hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres for club level guests, which I would have taken advantage of had known about it, but since I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually paying for club level I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not that upset about it. Another key factor is the terrific location of this property. It is only a 5 minute stroll to the French quarter in a clean, quiet spot. It was so wonderful to be able to enjoy peace and quiet at night after leaving the non-stop party of Bourbon Street. Some of the things I loved: 1) Amazing staff: Especially the concierge (Adam) - very helpful and patient. The doormen and bell-hops were also great, getting you a taxi in the blink of an eye and welcoming you back every time you walked through the doors. 2) Renovated room was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I hope this hotel finishes their renovations quickly so others can enjoy it (and stop writing negative things about the older rooms to bring down the rating). 3) Marble shower was an awesome touch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There was no guard or delineation between shower and the rest of the bathroom so water splashed on the floor but I liked it anyway. 4) Lovely bar / lounge on the 2nd floor with a grand atmosphere and live jazz music! 5) Nice relaxing pool area (Just wish there were drinks served at the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though you can get one at the bar and bring it up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A couple saw me grab a nice glass of wine to enjoy while reading by the pool and went to do the same). 6) Absolutely delicious fresh made New Orleans Pralines left on your bedside table during turndown service in the evening.

I did hear some banging but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a major problem and will obviously not be going on forever. The only surprise we encountered was that we could hear the people next door talking so the walls must be fairly thin, but again, not a deal-breaker.

Our suite, while large, was sooo dated...old worn out carpet, old worn out sofas, bath fixtures that were probably 25 years old, dripping faucet, painted doors in bathroom had faded to old yellow, no slim line TV in living room, an old worn out kitchen with nothing in it but a hard to use coffee pot and and old musty full size regrigerator!

One of the fantastic things about this hotel is the concierge lounge, located on the 23rd floor. The lounge was closed for renovations earlier in the summer, but according to the website was open for my stay. Only it wasn't. When we arrived, we were given a letter informing us of the hours of operation of the Concierge lounge, including breakfast. But when we got there for breakfast, it was locked. I called the manager and he said that there was an \"internal problem\". Yes, the Windsor paid for us to eat at their restuarant, but the views from the 2nd floor over the entranceway aren't the same as from the 23rd floor overlooking the river. Which means I didn't benefit from a concierge level room. I complained and the manager discounted my room (a junior suite) to the same rate as a non-concierge level room. But there were other issues. A friend called and was transferred 3 times before she got to my room. The coffee maker in the room didn't work (and when I was reported it, the person on the front desk didn't seem to care). The iron was beat up and snagged the dress I was ironing and it leaked water profusely. (Yes, it was changed after 3 phone calls). This is a wonderful hotel but the service this time was awful, not at all my experience in the past. What is happening to one of my favorite hotels?? Not sure I would stay here next time I'm in town.

I had a few trepidations concerning the dated nature of the rooms from reading some earlier, unfavorable reviews regarding the condition of the hotel. I spoke with the General Manager who allayed those fears and assured me that my stay would meet my expectations. But in fact, our time at Windsor exceeded my expectations. Our room was quite large and classically elegant; the pool area was beautiful and had an attendant on site; the bathrooms were large and the shower head rejuvenating; our balcony and bedroom views were of the beautiful N.O. skyline; the beds were quite comfortable, and the sheets and bedding were plush; turn down service was a nice touch after having been out about town. The valet, porter, maids and room service staff were extraordinarily helpful and prompt without being overbearing. The hotel is being renovated from top to bottom, and there are a few dated items in the hotel.

We go back with every firm intention of having a lovely stay. But we hadn't been there in a few years. Alas. The two main problems are the physical condition of the hotel and the attitude of management and staff. Physical, just the room -- grease stains on the sofa and threads dangling; carpet either worn-and-dirty or just *really* worn. When I got to the room, the A/C was blowing hot. The button that raised and lowered the TV from its odd little box and the foot of the bed didn't work. But the TV was old and clapped out and the colors weren't right. Bathtub and fixtures with chipped porcelain. Both lamps in the bathroom flickering so badly you could hardly stand to stay in there. The sink didn't drain properly. Cherry on the sundae? When I got to the room and lifted the cover on the toilet, it hadn't been flushed since the last user. Ugh. I had to raise some of these issues and nobody apologized, nobody did anything to make things better (other than the engineer who did get the A/C working). All anybody in the hotel said was \"you should come back after we do renovations next year\". Well, that doesn't help this stay. Elsewhere in the hotel, things were no better. I had to attend a meeting where everybody was complaining about how cold the room was -- temperature set on 60 degrees and even though they told me that the organizers complained repeatedly, it never got better. And I just have to say that the fancier staff you dealt with -- bellmen, phone operators, desk people -- were somewhere between indifferent and clueless. The housekeepers, waiters, and engineers just fine, but the others, no. It's really sad to see the hotel fall down like this. Nothing they did or said will encourage me to come back.

In fact the great service was evident prior to our arrival., I communicated with Pam Lambert at the hotel for our booking and she was wonderful to deal with. The hotel has a quiet elegance - a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street. We had a full suite and it was beautiful. It wasn't worn and tattered as previous reviews had said. Perhaps our room had been updated. I don't know. I just know that we were extremely comfortable and well rested. My daughter said that she slept better there than at home. We ordered room service a few times and the service was spot on: friendly, efficient and the food was delicious. They thought of everything including the white linens and flowers. We dined in The Grill Room one evening and one morning and both meals were amazing. Our server at breakfast was Adam and he was knowledgeable and extremely professional. He even gave us a card entitling us to complimentary sparkling wine with dinner later. As for dinner, I have a nut allergy and my daughter cannot eat meat and they were wonderfully accommodating. The amuse bouche was foie gras and topped with crushed cashews and because we were unable to eat it, the chef made us a special combination of fresh peas, pea sprouts, morels and fiddleheads. Delicious! The restaurant is very elegant but not at all stuffy. Our servers Mary and Billy were friendly and so very nice and of course the food was lovely. Lastly we lounged by the pool for a few hours and again the young lady who worked the deck was great and the loungers and pool great.

As a member of one of the large Krewes, we travel to N.O. every year and have previously enjoyed the Windsor Court. We've overlooked the \"oldness,\" things like the exhaust vents having an inch of dust on them and the worn carpet because it's a great location and the rooms are normally large. For further perspective, my friend and I have been responsible for referring multiple people to stay at this hotel. When people join us at Mardi Gras and fly in we've always said stay here. My friend had just brought his family there over Christmas as well and has stayed there several other times on business. There has been untold dollars spent at this hotel based on our stay. This year we arrived as usual, payed $320 a night not including fees and walked into our room and it literally felt like a closet. We didn't even know they had these rooms at \"an all suite hotel.\" That is a quote from one of the staff when we inquired about our room and how we ended up in something smaller than the La Quinta at double the price. Our inquiries were met with a complete indifference mainly from the manager on staff who even went so far as to question whether I had stayed there every year since 2005. They plain and simple, did not care that we had spent our hard earned money there and been very loyal customers. Here's the rest. As has been mentioned many times already, the TV remote could change channels on the very outdated \"Motel 6\" TV, but it could not turn the TV on and off. You had to get out of bed to do that. In room free coffee was never refilled at this \"4 star hotel.\" We asked three times and finally someone brought it. The plunger in the sink would not close when my friend wanted to put in his contacts and didn't want to lose one down the sink. He pushed it down and then it wouldn't open so the sink later filled up with water. When the maid came in, she pulled the plunger out completely and left it sitting on the sink until we checked out 2 days later. It would have been easy for the management of the Windsor Court to make us feel a little better about a very substandard stay for a very expensive room. Access to Club Level, discount next year, dinner or whatever. They could have done something but they couldn't care less. Two different managers on two different days. We asked about the room professionally and respectfully and were met with complete indifference. We are the type of people that are loyal but expect the same in return.

After a twelve hour day on the road, we were looking forward to a good nights sleep and an overnight to recharge our batteries to hit the road again in the morning. As we drove into the city there were motorcyle police everywhere with screaming sirens escorting buses through the city streets. I thought there was either a sports event or some political dignitary and his entourage arriving. I guess we were the only people on the planet who didn't know that it was the first day of Mardi Gras (which we were informed of when we reached the hotel). We checked into the hotel at a discounted rate arranged the prior evening by a direct phone call to the hotel's front office manager. Our GPS guided us into the labyrinth of downtown streets and to the hotel. we drove into a beautiful walled courtyard (it had the feel of arriving at a private mansion) and were greeted at our car door by friendly staff. Valet Parking in a secure garage with an overnight charge for the parking. The hotel is older, but elegant and sophisticated. The same manager who I had spoken to the previous evening greeted us upon arrival (he had a very unsual first name - the same as our favorite cruise line). He gave us a beautiful corner room, despite our discounted room rate (and no doubt a full hotel). In retrospect, I am amazed we were even able to GET a room during this annual event. Somehow, arriving clueless turned out to be an advantage. Sleep would have to wait as there was a Mardi Gras parade right outside our 5th floor window - we watched in comfortable night clothes. The parade went on for hours and provided a superb experience. We've avoided this world famous festival - thinking about all of the debauchery touted by the media, it just wasn't my style. I was surprised by the reality of what we saw. Little kids and families on the side of the street, dressed up in carnival outfits with funny hats, adults (fully dressed) and enjoying themselves, high school and military bands, it was one of the best parades we've ever seen. The rooms are spacious, the beds and linens finest quality and comfortable. The bath was spacious, marble and had two sitting/sink areas (one in the bath and one outside of it). the hotel is a short walk to the tourist areas of New Orleans - the french quarter and their beautiful waterfront. Other comments at this site have discussed the televisions. True, they are not flat screen, high definition sets that you might expect - in fact the television sets are ancient. The kind you might expect a coat hanger for an antenna, Faces were green - it was comical - but my answer to that is - who comes to New Orleans to watch television. I think the televisions are probably the only flaw in the armor of this superb hotel. We were tired from our trip and chose to order room service. They have a restaurant in the hotel. thinking there might be a larger choice I called room service and requested a menu from their restaurant. Within minutes the Room Service Supervisor, dressed in a suit and tie, showed up at our door with the menu and let us know we could order anything we wished from either the standard room service menu or from the restaurant menu. We chose the restaurant menu and were not disappointed. it was an Incredible meal. Rack of lamb, creme brulee. I was concerned that ordering only one meal and splitting it would bring an inadequate amount of food. So I also ordered a Margherita Pizza (we were unable to finish the pizza as there was just too much food). Excellent taste, large portions. In fact, the meal was one of the finest we've ever had in a hotel from room service. During our week long road trip we spent time in many of the cookie cutter, omnipresent hotels that populate every interstate exit. The Windsor Court was like stepping into a Mercedes after driving a Yugo.

We lost most ours somewhere on Bourbon St, which was, I'm sure, to be expected. Our room was huge. Walking in there's a small wet-bar and then a grand sitting area with couches, a table and a balcony. Make a right through double french doors and you find the bedroom- a desk, a giant bed, a pop-up television and another balcony. Turn right from there and you find a small closest area with room for a dresser and some ironing, and through there is the bathroom. The room was awesome and the bed was so comfortable that our first night at home left us stiff and honestly we are now shopping for a new mattress and pillows that would somehow compare to the luxe ones we had at Windsor Court. I have 2 small complaints. First, they have a lovely Keurig coffee-maker in the room but the coffee was never refilled. I didn't find it important enough to call anyone about though- I'm sure they would have brought more coffee if I had- but at the same time I feel the cleaning staff should obviously check and refill a wet-bar, same as they would the soap in the bathroom. Second, I found showering here to be a huge pain. I don't know if it's the hotel or the city itself, but the water is so soft it took 5 extra minutes to wash the soap off my body. Also, the drain was kinda clogged which is never any fun, but again, I never called down about it so I can't really complain. All in all, this hotel is wonderful.

We ordered breakfast for the room and felt like royalty. They set up the table in our sitting room with linens and a beautiful food presentation. Other mornings we took advantage of the Club Level breakfast.....fritattas and lox/bagels! The view from the Club was even more impressive. At night we would enjoy having a drink in the hotel bar.

I like the location and the hotel rooms. This time we booked a suite (traveling with friends) with an adjoining room. The arrangement is perfect: there is a door that shuts off the end of the hall and the suite is on one side and the very spacious double room on the other. This was perfect. The suite comes equipped with a full galley kitchen: fridge, sink and stove. The bed was very comfortable and on the first night, the room was equipped with lovely linens and extras like a linen mat on each side of the bed. BUT, for having booked a suite and paid full rack rate ($550 per night), there were odd omissions that were just annoying. For instance, despite a full convenience bar, there were no bar glasses, or bar napkins. There was a full kitchen, but no kitchen towel. I was told by room service that I should have ordered breakfast with the door tag menu instead of calling but there were none in our room. There was a king size bed but only three pillows. The pillows in the sham covered pillows didn't have any cases on them. On the second night, housekeeping had not replaced wash clothes or bath mats. The little linen bedside mats were missing and we still didn't have drink glasses. Shampoo was not re-stocked. This all seems like trivial stuff; however, it was just annoying given the overall cost of the room. The room was clean and the bed and overall layout very comfortable. But, it's a bit like putting out only a B effort when with just a bit more effort, the experience would be exceptional and not just good.

Having stayed in several top-notch hotels in the US, I expected more from a hotel that is supposed to be one of New Orleans finest. First of all, the suite I stayed in was rather outdated. From the other reviews here, it seems that only the Club floor suites/rooms have been refurbished the recent years. I do not see how a 5 star hotel can operate with this kind of difference (club vs. non-club rooms). The kitchenette must be from the 70s or so, the sofa horribly dated and worn and the hot water system did not work well in the evenings (had to wait ten minutes before the water was warm enough for a shower). Secondly, I understand that prices on everything on a hotel like this is higher than usual. But charges like 5.50 dollar for a black coffee at breakfast is IMO just too much. Valet was 32 dollar, which is acceptable I guess if its quick and efficient. But at least once during my stay, I had to wait outside for my car for like 15 minutes, even though I had called well in advance from my room.

I do agree that some of the rooms could use some updating and some modern touches(direct cinema, newer tvs), however, I liken the Windsor Court to your favorite great aunts house-the one who has the beautiful home that you have been going to since you were a child. As you were growing up you loved going to visit and loved the rich fabrics, lovely furnishings and warmth it all conveyed. As you grew older, the furnishings all still stayed the same-the lovely drapes, the one of a kind artwork-and while your own taste evolved, you still loved visiting your aunts home-even though some would call it dated-but to you it was warm and comforting. Some travelers prefer their\" luxury\" to be more along the lines of downright gaudy or more minimalist-I consider it a luxury to be somewhere that it makes it feel like you are at home.

The good: if you like old-south style with floral curtains, fabrics, antique-looking furnishings, hunting-scene paintings, etc, it's great; charming even. The hallways are very elegant and the entry is garnished with a huge floral arrangement -- probably 200 roses in a giant vase. The room was also quiet, despite the fact that we were on the third floor. The one exception was when the maid woke us up at 9am on Saturday by ringing the bell. We couldn't have put out a do not disturb sign, because there wasn't one in the room. Had to ask for one. The bad: the heavy curtains missed about 2 feet to close the gap, so the room was never dark. Old cheap giant-tube TV's (we had to ask for a remote). Although charming in some ways, the room was extremely dated, frayed around the edges with sorely needed upgrades. When we needed a remote control and a do not disturb sign, there was no answer at either the front desk or operator, so we finally called the concierge. Sunday morning, the coffee service ended at 9am! The restaurant wasn't open yet, so there was no option for coffee! On a Sunday morning! The good part was that when we found kitchen staff, they graciously put together a tray with some leftover coffee and sugar/cream for us. Location is good. Two blocks to the quarter; almost directly across from Harrah's, if you're into gambling. Kudos for FREE Wifi!

I was really excited to stay here and we booked through the Amex Platinum Fine hotels and resorts program. This got us a late check-out (which we didn't use, due to flight times), free breakfast each morning, and tea in Le Salon. The breakfasts were good-one day we went down to the Grill and one day we did room service-food was good both times. We did go to afternoon tea at Le Salon, which is always fun. We stayed on the club level with a river view suite. We liked the club lounge, which had great hors dourves and drinks in the evening. I know some people have said the rooms look tired or old, and I didn't find that to be the case-the decor is just more formal, and not as modern as some hotels you may see. The location is right across the street from Harrah's if you like to gamble (we do) and right off Canal street, and it's a very short easy walk to the Quarter. The location is great because you're not on Bourbon, but you're not far from it either. Here were my drawbacks about the hotel-we arrived on Sunday around noon (we stayed at Royal Sonesta with friends for the first part of the trip), and were not surprised that our room wasn't ready-it was 3 hours before their 3:00 p.m check in time. We were checked in, and told that a rush would be put on the room to be cleaned, they'd call us when it was ready, and in the meantime they would hold our bags. No big deal, we left and got some lunch and drinks in the Quarter. We came back to the hotel at 3:00 pm and were told that the room still wasn't ready, but that they would go ahead and put a rush on it to be cleaned. Exuse me? That should have already happened. It's not unreasonable to assume that at standard check-in time the room would be ready. We told them that this was supposed to have happened 3 hours ago-and we had a 4:30 reservation to get ready for. They did apologize and said that again, they would call when the room was ready. About 10 min later, it was, so I calmed down. Got to the room, and it was nice-but the conditioner in the shower had already been opened and used, and the ice bucket had melted water in it from whomever used it previously. Hmmmm.... The next day we left around 9:30 a.m. and got back into the room around 3 p.m.-and again, it hadn't been cleaned-we did ask the front desk what time that normally happened and they had it taken care of.

One of our party who stayed elsewhere was not even interested in seeing the hotel because she was not interested in what she perceived to be the decor. For the price, it was a great value. Easily worth three times the price in NYC. Service outstanding. My biggest complaint about the Windsor Court was the fact that I could not get coffee the first morning once I left my room. It is unacceptable that coffee cannot be had inside the hotel in the morning if you fall between the restaurant's breakfast hour and lunch hour. I ordered room service the next morning which I guess was the hotel's intent. In my mind there is no excuse for not having in-room coffee available. If I'm at this hotel I will spend enough money in the hotel so that in room coffee is not a concern. Very disappointing.

We had a stretch limo and arrived at the hotel in the early evening. Check-in was extremely gracious. Our room was a Club Level Full Suite on the 21st floor with an amazing view of the Mississippi River. The room was beautifully appointed in a feminine style and the marble bathroom setup was spacious and luxurious. We were hungry after our journey so we went to the Club Level Lounge on the 22nd floor to dine. The food buffet was outstanding and we had a tapas dinner with cocktails and soft drinks. Even my fussy two year old enjoyed the dinner. Michael in the Lounge was friendly , warm and did a great job making us feel welcome. After dinner we retired to our room. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was no street noise from below. The next morning we had an early breakfast at the Club Lounge and the breakfast spread was just as impressive and delicious as dinner had been the night before. Service was again warm and friendly. The Club Level Concierge Ryan, who was gracious and helpful, suggested a restaurant for dinner that evening and gave us a map to help us explore the city. We visited the Cafe du Monde, Jackson Square, the French Market, the Riverwalk, the Aquarium of the Americas. We also took a carriage ride through the French Quarter and a ride on the Natchez Steamboat. After that full day exploring the city we returned to the hotel. We needed a cab to go to dinner so the doorman whistled aloud for a cab out on the street to proceed inside the hotel courtyard. Our doorman asked us where we were going and told the cab driver the name and address of the restaurant in a tone of voice that said, these are our people, take good care of them. It was at that moment that I knew that this was a truly great hotel. After dinner, it was a beautiful evening and we decided to stroll back to the hotel. The next day, after another wonderful breakfast in the Club Lounge, we took the St. Charles Streetcar out to the Audubon Zoo. The zoo was amazing and the kids loved it. Afterwards, we rode the streetcar back and arrived at the hotel in the mid afternoon. My six year old son and I went down to the pool on the 4th floor and enjoyed sitting in the hot tub. We had a blast talking and laughing. It was my birthday so we dressed for dinner and again our wonderful doorman whistled for a cab for us and we proceeded to Comander's Palace for dinner which was fantastic in every way. After returning to the hotel, we got the kids in bed and I went up to the Club Lounge and had a cocktail and printed out our airline boarding passes for our flight the next day. Checkout was again gracious and warm and our driver was in the lobby to take us to the airport. This time the car service sent a super stretch limo that my son was amazed with. As we rode to the airport, I gazed out the window reflecting on our fantastic experience in New Orleans. We arrived at the airport and departed for home.

Check-in was so easy,quick,and friendly. I was thrilled to learn that our suite was ready because we checked in about 4 hours early. We were entranced by the beautiful and sedate lobby,and we were quite impressed with the ultra speedy elevators. I was blown away by the fabulous view of the river from our room.I sat by the expansive bay windows in the bedroom for a long time each night enjoying the view! Our suite was HUGE and gorgeous. The living room and bedroom furniture was elegant. The wallpaper was cheerful and bright. We utilized the refrigerator in the kitchen area for the bottled water and soft drinks provided by the Club Lounge-very handy. The dressing area between the bedroom and beautiful marble bathroom was such a great size. It contained the large closet with safe,and also a nice vanity area with sink. We loved having that extra sink! The bathroom was also beautiful with plenty of space for your stuff. The bathtub/shower combo was very large-great shower! We were so spoiled by the staff in the Club Lounge. Really-is there a better staff in New Orleans? No request was too big or too small. We just loved having the option of eating a light breakfast overlooking the river scene,and being able to come back in the evening for another light meal if we were too tired to go back out.I agree with a previous review- Michael in the Club Lounge is fabulous! Oh-the swimming pool area has got to be one of the nicest in town. The pool itself is very large compared to other hotel pools in town.My daughter and I went swimming one night-the pool was nicely heated and the hot tub was divine!It was a beautiful evening. We had a fabulous time in the French Quarter,in the Garden District, and on a swamp tour,but our favorite part of the entire trip was our stay at the Windsor Court. We were sad to check out,but delighted to learn that we could come back later in the day to utilize the club lounge as we had a late flight out. This was much nicer than waiting around at the airport. Other things we loved-the beautiful,quiet courtyard at the front of the hotel-provided a nice separation from the noise of the city.We also enjoyed strolling around the hotel admiring their extensive art collection.

Nice room. Had a fridge, microwave and a stove. The furnishings were a little dated, but the size of the room was great. I should note, that the rate I got was $240 which included full dinner for two at the Grill Room ... so I could handle the older furnishings for such a great rate. Great food. The Grill Room was excellent. Again, the room rate included the suite AND dinner for two at the Grill Room. Had steak & lobster one night and Shrimp the next. Both meals were really good. Great location. Just steps away from the French Quarter and a block from canal street and the streetcar. Across the street from Harras Casino. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you can get the rate with the meal included.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, SC", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't get any better\u201d", "Author": "Michael965", "ReviewID": "UR34865115", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Windsor Court Hotel the second week of July.

Our stay at the Windsor Court had both highlights and lowlights. Despite it looking very grand, the preponderance of green marble, old fashioned sofas, and library-quiet atmosphere rendered the lobby slightly stuffy and outdated. It is an almost hilarious contrast with its next door neighbor, the W (where we stayed last year), where they try almost too hard to be hip. Location is great, and the pool and gym were both very nice. Our junior suite was spacious, clean and comfortable, the bed was heavenly, but oddly, only 2 pillows for a king bed. Furnishings were a little tired, but still nice enough. Bathroom was very average (my towels at home are better) with low water pressure - a real bummer when trying to rinse off the Fairgrounds grit. Our biggest disappointment was we could not get full closure of the drapes, no matter how I tried to gerry-rig them. As a result, we awoke every day at sunrise, because sun was streaming in our room through the openings in the drapes - not a good thing in such a late-night town. I asked for eye masks, and the front desk replied they had none. This may not be a problem for many, but it was a huge problem for us. We have not experienced this problem at any other hotel we have stayed at in NOLA. We dined at the hotel twice, for breakfast and for brunch. The breakfast menu was creative and delicious. Service was great, and the meal was delivered promptly. The brunch menu was equally adventurous and delicious. Unfortunately, it took almost 2 hours for them to serve the three courses we ordered. The room was not busy - we could really not understand why the service was so insufferably long, and no one bothered to explain or apologize for the ridiculous delay. My overall impression of the hotel is that it is geared to the 60+ traveler who is early to bed, early to rise, has nothing but time on their hands, and likes traditional, clubby, quiet, and slightly stuffy surroundings.

The 2nd completed bed had the obligatory folded robe and slippers so how house keeping missed this is beyond me. No big deal, just not what you expect from 4 stars.

This hotel has in room Ice service. No big deal, made the call and in room ice service was promised \"right away\". 40 mins passes and we are still iceless. Finally it showes up in a giant sack which is handed to me.(side note: The next day I made the mistake of calling for ice again, 30 mins pass AGAIN with no ice. I walked downstairs and offer to pickup the ice myself to stress my dissapointment. I was promised ice and two cups immediately. The door bell rings, ICE (CHECK) Cups (NOPE) No big deal, just not what you expect from 4 stars. Upon leaving the room that night we discovered the toilet was non functional. This was remedied with a call and was repaired upon our return that evening, That same night we tried room service wich was prompt, courteous and tasty.

I missed the note stating to call to have your plates picked up which I then did before we left our room that evening to hit the town once again.

Our minibar was not restocked either. No big deal, just not what you expect from 4 starts.

It's nice to see another positive recent review from an LA guy, since I think New Orleans is nothing less than LA's next Las Vegas with better food. I'm not some hotel shill you see all over the place here. See my review of the hotel Wynn a few months ago--I have recently been to both Las Vegas and New Orleans, and I can tell you New Orleans as a destination wins hands down. And if you like to gamble, Windsor Court has Harrah's RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. Wow, all that and high tea (Thursday through Sunday). And when you go to N.O., you want to stay in the Windsor Court. The hospitality, the room, the location, even the pool were all top notch, better than Wynn. They can't do enough for you. These guys \"get it.\" See, New Orleans is actually in decent economic shape, with an unemployment rate that would make Schwarzenegger envious, but I don't see the national prominence yet. Its influence is regional. The way this town is going to recover its big, national tourism reputation is one guest at a time, one family at a time. Convince enough of us that there isn't Mississippi mud running through the streets, and we'll tell our friends and neighbors, never mind the whole internet. I think they understand this at Windsor Court. I can tell you, the central portion of N.O. is pretty much as I left it in 1998. Except for Antoine's and K-Paul's (neither of which I particularly miss), the place is back to baseline. Muffaletta at Central? Check. Camellia Grill? Check. Cafe du Monde? Did it ever close? Emeril's? DItto. Palace Cafe? Check. By the way, the kids had a pretty good time in New Orleans, and we felt safe in the city. The place was crawling with cops. Nice job, NOPD. Children's Musem, Insectarium, trying new foods, streetcar, Audubon Park, Tulane campus were highlights for the family. Also, WC has a decent pool, heated nice n' toasty and also saltwater(!), but no waterslide, so go to Orlando for that, last time I counted there's like a billion of them over there. In fact, if you have the kind of kid that will only stay in a hotel with a water slide, then you really shouldn't come to New Orleans. Ever. You know, Uptown looked pretty good also. Audubon Park is as nice as I've ever seen it. Ok, a minor nit--I would have liked working internet access in the room--it was supposedly free, but I couldn't get it to work. I haven't had much luck with \"free\" internet at any hotel, really, so no major loss. I thought the room was lovely, comfortable, nicer than my house, clean, and well-designed. It's also a terrific value right now, with rooms to be had for $209 for this coming weekend and the famous French Quarter Festival. We checked while we were there, because we were considering extending our stay a few days! Shh, don't tell anyone! Honestly, people, New Orleans really isn't \"about\" free in-room internet, or what kind of TV you have in your room, or a microwave. You really want a microwave in your room? With Palace Cafe less than 500 yards away? Why did you come to New Orleans? Ok, guys, renovations are not on the agenda, so forget the marble bath and separate shower. There is a bidet, which I suppose could be used as a shower, if you are so inclined. Did you read the New York Times this week? A lot of these fancy joints will be fortunate to stay open in the next year or two. I am hoping very strongly that Windsor Court is one of the survivors.

After seeing some current photos taken by a Trip Advisor reviewer, I asked AmEx to book me into a different hotel. The choice of the Windsor Court could not have been better! Upon my early arrival, Ashley on the front desk greeted me enthusiastically and was genuinely interested in my birthday celebration trip! She had upgraded me from a Junior Suite to a Full Suite (I didn't know it at this point) and as the room was not ready said they would store the luggage and call me on my cell phone the moment it was ready. This was fine as we had a full day's activities planned. In the early afternoon, the call came as promised. However, we didn't complete the check in for a couple hours because we were having too much fun snacking on raw oysters in the French Quarter. When we did arrive back at the hotel, I was again cheerfully greeted and told my luggage would be brought up immediately. I was pleasantly shocked to see we had been upgraded to a FULL suite. The luggage arrived within 5 minutes (you know at some hotels it can take an hour). Shortly afterwards, the door bell rang and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot had been sent by the hotel management as birthday cheer! Again, a super pleasant surprise! Throughout our stay, staff (restaurant, bellmen, concierge) kept asking how the birthday trip was going and giving me birthday wishes on the exact day. Everyone seemed to really enjoy working at the hotel and the feeling was passed on to the guests. This was a huge positive. I don't think I need to describe the room, other than to say it was super clean and everything was in working order and really, the bedding was luxurious! I fell asleep quickly and easily each night. The marble floors and walls in the bath were opulent. The shower was hot and strong. It's probably a shame we didn't spend more time in the room! Our city view was fantastic! The main restaurant, The New Orleans Grill, was a bit pricey for breakfast, but absolutely excellent. On our last morning there, the staff even came by to say \"goodbye\" and \"safe trip.\" They also offered to pack snacks and fruit for us for the drive!

Seriously overall It was great.Yes It could use new furniture but the hotel is miles better than others in the area,and the staff go out of their way to accomodate.As I always end my reviews :You can have the best product in the world,but If you cant back It up efficiently and effectively you dont have a darn thing.They do It right.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Best!\u201d", "Author": "mulehouse", "ReviewID": "UR20725588", "Content": "This hotel is incredible!! the staff, the furnishings, the amenities are all over the top.

It was not fixed and when we told that to the front desk staff, they immediately offered to move us to another room.

Again, we said, \"no thank you!! The staff could not have been nicer. This was our first trip back since Katrina. We were a little apprehensive about what we would find (and, our friends are using us as their scouts) but we felt like we were immediately taken back into pre Katrina (with a few things here and there that were bordered up) and were so excited to return to the city we love.

The staff was very professional and courteous, but when we got to the room we were shocked! SHOCKING is the only way to describe it. The carpet had many obvious stains, and was coming up at the seams. The bed had a permanent 'body' indention and looked like the mattress had never been turned in 30 years. I am not exaggerating. The chrome was substantially worn off of the bathroom fixtures. I called the front desk and told them that the room was unacceptable. They did not sound surprised, and as our luggage had not been brought up yet, they said that the bellman would bring a key to a new room. My wife went down to the lounge to hide. As we were leaving the first room I asked the bellman, \"not to put too fine of a point on it, but do you have a room that has been remodeled in the last 10 years?\" He replied \"none of our rooms have ever been remodeled.\" I think this is true. When we got to the new room, it was better as far as having no major stains on the carpet, which was still glued down, and the bed looked better. I stayed in the room and my wife came up. The bathroom fixtures were still worn, and it had the same 30 year old kitchenette area. As I was sitting in a chair discussing the situation with my wife, I noticed my arm feeling sticky on the arm of the chair. There was nothing obvious there, but it did bring my attention to the fact that the upholstery was mostly worn off of the arm on the chair. We looked around again and decided to leave. At the front counter, the manager on duty was very apologetic and didn't want us to leave. I agreed to go with him to look at a Club Level room, which supposedly is the only level that has been remodeled. I looked around the room, and I can't say it was remodeled. It was perhaps maintained, in the that the carpet and fixtures were better, but it still had the 30 year old kitchenette, and the furniture and fixtures appeared to be the same as in the previous two rooms. It was in better condition, and if this had been the first room we got to, we probably would have stayed in it, but at this point it was not enough of an improvement to remedy the disappoint my wife and I felt. We left the hotel and stayed in the Westin, which was close, and at least clean and well maintained.

It definitely has a certain charm and ambience to it, but it's just not my thing. I would say I enjoy a more modern aesthetic and the Windsor Court didn't quite do it for me with all the flowery, old-school looking decor. We stayed in one of the spacious suites, but honestly, the living room is not terribly inviting, so we barely used it during our stay. There is also a small kitchen (no microwave) in the room that went unused. Frankly, when I'm on vacation, the last thing I want to see is a kitchen! Nonetheless, overall, the rooms were pretty decent. The bathroom was also very spacious and the dressing area outside the bathroom was nice as well. However, the bathroom had a strange mix of amenities - i.e. the bath products were from 2-3 different brands! Odd. Also, the beds were rock hard which did not make for very comfortable slumber. Service was also spotty. Funnily enough, we went during a weekend when the hotel was anticipating a VERY special guest, so about a week beforehand, we received a call about heightened security and keeping indentification on you at all times. That was fine. However, my in-laws (who also stayed there as guests of the wedding as well) were told during check-in that they would need to be moved to another hotel for the last night due to special circumstances. However, when my husband and I checked in later that same day, we were not told anything and when we asked about it, they assured us that we would not be moved. Nonetheless, the next day, we were in fact told that we would be moved. So, when we tried to ask details about the move, the guy at the front desk seemed clueless. They were going to move us on the day of the wedding, so getting the logistics ironed out was important because we would not even be around most of the day to move bags, check-out, etc. So, information was delayed, staff were confused - it was a bit of a mess. They finally got us straightened out and were gracious enough to comp us a room at the Loews Hotel for all the trouble. So, in that respect, they went above and beyond. As for the pros, their afternoon tea is a lovely, relaxing experience - a fun thing to do with girlfriends or loved one. The hotel is also conveniently located and actually lies a bit outside of the French Quarter so you're not inundated with noise and rowdiness.

It had been approximately 10 years since I had stayed at Windsor Court, but remembered the hotel was very nice and at the rate they were charging, approximately $750 per room on Club level, on a Sunday night by the way, I felt it should be nice. When I made our reservations, I indicated that we would require an early check-in. The morning of our check-in, I again phoned the hotel to advise them that we would require early check-in, and they said there would be no problem. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 1:30 p.m., and our rooms weren't ready until after 4:00 p.m.. So much for our early check-in. (Standard check in is 3:00 p.m.) Not only did they not have any of our rooms ready, 3 in total, but when I mentioned to the front desk person that I had specifically requested an early check-in and could he please let me know approximately what time our rooms would be ready, he told me in attitude overload with all but the head banging, \"It's all up to housekeeping, we have no idea\". I asked him if he could possibly phone housekeeping to let them know that we were there, ready to occupy our rooms, and could they possibly do our rooms next. He then told me, \"All these people are in front of you--We have no idea when your rooms will be ready but if you have a cell phone we'll call you when they are\". No, \"I'm sorry Miss, but please take this voucher and have a free drink/lunch on us while we see what we can do with our housekeeping staff\", or \"Miss, let me give you your club level key and please feel free to go there for comfort while you wait and we'll contact you as soon as your room(s) are ready\". Nothing. He was a jerk and it set the entire 24 hours off on a bad note. Once in the room, I phoned the hotel manager to complain, but I was on hold so long that I eventually just hung up in frustration. As on so many hotels, the main lobby is very nice--nice artwork, beautiful floors, traditional old money decor with great ambience. But the Suite itself, needs a facelift. Badly. (We were in Suite 2106) There were two lamps with bad bulbs, the minibar key didn't work, even the bellman couldn't get it to work and they had to send another, the carpet was soiled--both in the room and in the hallway. The countertops in the dressing room and in the bathroom were severly out of date-I practically had to bend over to touch my toes to brush my teeth in the sink, and they were very worn around the edges and around the wallpaper. The bedding, bed coverlet, was dated, although the bed was comfortable enough. To be fair, my husband did say the view was nice from the balcony, and we did get our wake up call as scheduled the next morning. We had lunch at their main grill, and it was okay, but just okay. We had a driver scheduled to pick us up from the hotel to take us back to the airport, and after two attempts to get a bellman, my husband and I drug our items ourselves, I had several large boxes, thru the lobby and to the car. Our driver kept saying to us, \"I can't believe they don't have a bellman, I can't believe they aren't helping us....\". Overall, with things in New Orleans as they are in the aftermath of Katrina, and as dependent as the city is on tourism, you would think that courtesy and customer satisfaction would be top on their minds to make you want to return to New Orleans. Unfortunately, nothing that Windsor Court did made me want to rush back to 'help' the New Orleans economy. It is very apparent they don't have a properly trained staff, at least not at Windsor Court, and the staff I did deal with there could have cared less about satisfying a customer.

The rooms are still huge, the common areas are still elegant, but it's all very dated and in need of a refresh. The common areas smell moldy. The TV's are old tube TV's that just don't fit in with a luxury hotel.

When I asked about wireless internet they said it was broken,but that i could use complimentary wired access in the room. Unfortunately, despite a number of calls, i could never get the internet access to work. The deadbolt lock on my room door didn't work, and as a female travelling alone that made me very uncomfortable. I asked them to fix it--it never got fixed. I requested a USA Today in the morning instead of the Times Picayune--they continued to deliver the TP. All of these issues are fairly minor, but not what you expect in a luxury hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and the food was good. I hope they spend some money to update the property, because this was once a great hotel and deserves to be again.

While the view was not spectacular, due to the room being located on a lower floor, we found sitting on the balcony on a comfortable New Orleans evening very enjoyable.

If it were not done correctly it would not have lasted as long as it has and in the decent condition it appears. All that being said, it is time for an overhaul of the suites.

A nice welcome upon checking in and an upgrade to a small suite! Wonderful. Avoided the hotel parking fee of $30+ a day by parking one block away in an open air lot on Poydras Street.

Upon returning, I noticed that the thermostat was turned down, but really no solution to this problem during the entire weekend. The next morning, it was very nice to sit in the court area of the lobby with their complimentary coffee. And I was able to choose from five morning newspapers on their rack. (Sipping my coffee and reading the Financial Times in the Windsor Court that morning made me think that I actually had money! And then I came to.) A couple of other negatives. The toliet did not work well, and generally required two/three flushes. The television is in a box and can be rotated for viewing from bedroom or living room, but it is clunky and needs to be replaced by a flat TV.

At the reception, no way to get your room on time: waiting 5 hours in the afternoon does not look like a problem! And do not wait for any solution or proposition such as a drink or anything else! The room: not that small and not that huge: it is a real mini junior suite. one good point is the bed quality.

The pool: here is the worst. Forget this ridiculous anti-decoration.

The jacuzzi: even do not invite your enemy to enter it; you would be accused of crime after his bacterial attacks (I do not mention the old egg smell in the jacuzzi environment). Staff? Do you really need anybody when on a pool area? How spoiled children are you! If you cannot find the towels, well, go and buy one! Isn't that obvious in a 5 stars hotel? A good point for the barman, one of the few to try to do something 5 stars rated in the hotel. Others to be mentionned: I will not mention them but give them an advice: ESCAPE.... And they know that!

The club floor suites are decent size and have been refurbished, however, the over abundance of Pottery Barn room accents were a little tacky. The new club floor lounge is very nice, quite large, if not a bit understaffed. That was understandable, the first time we went in there, we were the only people. The next time, there were about 15 people. I think that Windsor Court realized that they had to do something and I think that they did a commendable job. A few minuses- Our balcony was covered in cigarette butts from the previous guest. There was an 'UNO' card in the middle of the bedroom floor (kinda weird). The room wasn't all that clean. The club level indicates that you will have fresh flowers and personalized stationary in your room. Had neither, but no big deal The one small ancient TV had a satellite system that regularly lost its signal.

We had stayed here 5 years previously for part of our honeymoon. Being Katrina victims ourselves, we had moderate expectations for this hotel now past the 1 year anniversary of that fateful day. And that is about what we got. The hotel is still beautiful but is a little worn. The rooms could use a refurbishing. The carpet has stains and the furniture is somewhat beat up. We stayed in a suite and had great views of the river. We booked it for $199 through the hotel web site. A great price for the Windsor in its current condition. I wouldn't pay more and I am sure we didn't pay this 5 years ago. There is only continental breakfast for room service and at $18 is way overpriced for toast, a biscuit and a crossiant with cofffee and OJ. And that is not including tax and service charge. You would do much better getting out for breakfast (and all your meals for that matter-this is New Orleans!). Lunch and dinner room service is only on the weekends. We did not eat in the Grill Room (the hotel restaurant). As for the rest of the service, it seemed understaffed but everyone was pleasant and glad we were there. Housekeeping was late everyday. No clean room until 3-5 pm. Getting our car always took a while with only 2 guys working valet. Overall, I am glad we stayed here but mostly for the memories. Both my husband and I inquired about possible renovations to this hotel and they are underway and working down the floors. Hopefully the Windor will return to its original prestigous status.

Having stayed in a suite at this hotel before, we discovered that the corner suites (1717, for example) are much larger than those elsewhere on the floor, even though they are the same price. There is a large bathroom, albeit with a plastic shower curtain in the tub instead of a separate shower, and a dressing room which includes another sink. The bedroom is a good size, although the bed is exceptionally uncomfortable and the bed linens are old and of poor quality. The living room is large, and has two sofas and an armchair around a coffee table, as well as a small dining table with two chairs; but there are only glass French doors separating it from the bedroom. There is a good-sized kitchen with a full-size refrigerator and a sink. A call to room service yielded a coffee maker along with the requisite cups, etc., for two people. The overall condition of the furnishings was acceptable, everything looking a bit dated but also clean and free of nicks, scratches and stains. High-speed Internet is free. The A/C has two zones and is reasonably quiet. The TVs, which incorporate a VCR, are ancient CRT boxes. There is a free library of videotaped movies downstairs. It was fun trying to remember how to use a VCR. Valet parking and check-out were friendly and efficient. However some other services are still in post-Katrina mode, which seems unnecessary nearly one year after the event. For example, the Front Desk agreed to gave the NYT delivered to our room every morning, but when I called to enquire about its whereabouts at 0630, I was told that the person who does that does not come on until 0700. (Although, curiously enough, the local paper was delivered to every room during the night.) There is still no concierge. Room service is still on a post-Katrina limited (type-written) menu, and it shuts down at 2300. Dinner was delivered promptly, but the table was not removed in response to our request. I put it in the corridor, and it was still there at 10 the next morning (quite smelly by that time). Breakfast is still buffet only, and a rip-off at $21 plus $3.50 for coffee (the first time I've paid extra for coffee with a buffet breakfast) plus 13% tax and no option of a continental breakfast at lower costs. When I questioned the bill on this last point, having consumed just two tiny muffins and a pat of butter, a suited Food and Beverage Manager showed up and refused to make any adjustment. In talking with the Director of Rooms who called to apologise about the two locust-sized insects which we found in our bedroom on the first night (one actually in the bed), we learned that floors 18-22 are being renovated and converted into a Club Level.

In recent years because we owned a home on the Mississippi coast, hotels in New Orleans were not an issue for us. With the wrath of Katrina so went our vacation home and when we decided to make our first trip after the hurricane at Thanksgiving, the Windsor Court was one of the few hotels open. The warm welcome we received then as well as on our subsequent visits has truly made the Windsor Court our home away from home. Although we have booked our rooms at the cheapest rate, we have always been upgraded to a junior or full suite. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and most of all quiet. The staff has always gone out of their way to help us in any way - including making our 10 and ll year old children feel special and welcome. The restaurant and bar are absolutely wonderful and there is fresh coffee on the 2nd floor each morning at 6:30 to enjoy with your complimentary newspaper. From the moment you pull into the courtyard, every member of the staff is at your beck and call. It is wonderful to see the same faces and receive a \"welcome back\" from Jackie or Robert at the front desk. Everything is done in a highly professional manner. As an added bonus, the hotel is directly across the street from Restaurant August which is run by John Besh, one of the most highly regarded chefs in New Orleans who is also a hero to those workers that he cooks for on a volunteer basis. And in a city that struggles on a day to day basis to survive in so many ways, the Windsor Court is an oasis of elegance and calm. While you are there, eating at the restaurant, having cocktails in the bar, high tea in the afternoon or lounging at the wonderful pool, you can almost forget that you are in the midst of an ongoing disaster. Because the Windsor Court is in the Central Business District, it is not the hotel for anyone whose purpose in visiting is Bourbon Street or the French Quarter, although it is an easy walk across Canal Street to get there.

Older bathroom fixtures, stained wallpaper, paint ready to peel in the bathroom and frayed upholstery. The deadbolt lock on the door did not work. Housekeeping promptly sent up a repairperson. There were some housekeeping missteps but I cut the hotel slack due to understaffing. No breakfast service. They should set up coffee urns in the lobby. The kitchenette had sticky counters and floors and old appliances. The Ritz Carlton is closed so no real competition. I would stay at WC again until no other game in town but I would not pay over $200. This is not up to Orient Express standards. New Orleans is back on its feet.

As an ex New Orleanian I am very familiar with most of the city's hotels. One night was enough to quickly gather that this wonderful hotel has many problems and is riding on it's famed reputation for service and luxury. I had reserved a \"full suite\" for $275 per night on a promotional rate on the Orient Express hotels website. I was assigned a large corner suite as requested. I have been an occassional guest of the Windsor Court for 15 years now. This was one of the finest hotels in the world; up until about 10 years ago this hotel shined like a diamond and was impeccably flawless in every way. It was slowly declining and now due to Hurricane Katrina and the resultant lack of staff, it's decline in service and ambience is horrible. The hotel is approximately 20 years old and is really starting to show it's age. The rooms and public areas need a serious remodel. The lovely art collection and classic British design will always remain but it's getting tired and everything needs a good scrub or replaced. Hurricane Katrina has resulted in the hotel being severely understaffed. The Windsor Court only has 30% of it's normal staffing levels \"including contract housekeepers\" according to the front desk clerk. Service was therefore dismal. The problems: a.) Housekeeping is very slack. My suite, 1501, had a 20 year old fridge with mold and mildew stains on the inside of the door. The top of the fridge and range hood were filthy and had not been cleaned since before Hurricane Katrina (8 months ago). b.) No turn down service (due to no staff). c.) Housekeeping was generally poor. Dusty room, stickers on the windows from October (glass was replaced due to hurricane blowing out the windows - housekeeping in 7 months had never bothered to remove the stickers from the new glass windows). d.) Room service is very limited (soups, sandwiches and simpler items) from 11 AM to 11 PM with a small menu. My lunch ordered at 1 PM was obviously previously prepared. The room service tray sat in the suite for 24 hours until I checked out. No one came to remove the tray. e.) No wi-fi internet in room. This is unacceptable for a hotel of the Windsor Court's famed stature. f.) Rooms with videocassette players. Not a DVD player in sight. Time to upgrade to Plasma flatscreens. g.) Horrible fabrics with clashing patterns (stripes on one sofa and brocade on the other) and loud floral prints on the curtains. Stripes, floral prints and patterned carpets create a hideous jungle of clashing fabrics. Very poor interior design. The Windsor Court needs a serious interior designer to keep the British \"country home\" a la Laura Ashley or Ralph Lauren feel. A luxury hotel needs to feel and look the part. h.) Worn out furniture. Nicked and abused. Quality furnishings that are now 20 years old and needing refinished. i.) Beds that are very ordinary. With even the Sheraton having a luxury bed with duvet cover, it's now time for the Windsor Court to deliver a luxury sleeping experience. Overall, this is still a lovely hotel. It is no longer 5 star. With a modernization program, serious renovation and more staff, it will easily once again become the premier grande dame of the city. Meanwhile, once the Ritz Carlton New Orleans reopens, it is a far superior property.

When we finally got in the condo it was much smaller than it appeared in the pictures. The condo might be not so bad if the people cleaning it for the owners knew how to clean but the comforter had chocolate left on it from previous renters and the floors were dirty. They're were not enough clean blankets either and every day I woke up with a headache from the mold in the air conditioner. The kitchenette was nice and the owners who were out of town and tried to fix any problems we had. I agree totally with the review too about the pool key and the fitness center smells so musty I couldn't breathe to even try to work out. For the price though it was overall OK. I was happy to be on the beach in a place that didn't have any bedbugs with this day and age. Even the expensive condos and resorts are getting them. The pools were clean and nice too. I looked in some of the other condo windows and some were much better and some were much much worse.

The price for this condo was great! The location, beach,pools, and size were perfect. It is very private and secluded! The locks to get into the pools and onto the beach were a pain because you only have one key for your whole party. Now for the not so perfect: i stayed in this condo from 7/23-7/30. When i arrived there was an overwhelming smell of bleach in the condo. We had to leave doors and windows open for the entire first day because our eyes were burning so bad from the fumes. You would think because of the smell it would have been very clean but that was not the case. The bedroom floors were discusting. There was hair and i am assuming comet all over the floors. This white powder would not all come up. We swept the condo probably 5 times before we felt like we could walk around without shoes. We even bought a sponge mop and pinesol to clean the floors. I was scared to let my toddler walk around out of my sight due to the chemicals under the sinks and in the floor. The washing machine smelled like mildew and has mold growing in it. The sheets were dirty and we had to wash all of them. The towels had long black hairs all over them so they had to be washed as well. The iron did not work, the can opener did not work , there was no dvd player. Like i said the price was great, but i was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the condo. I would not stay again due to the dirt. If i would not have paid in advance i would not have stayed after seeing how dirty it was. It was not small kid friendly as advertised. On a positive note the owners were very friendly and responded to let us check in and out promptly.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee, United States", "Title": "\u201cMUCH better- new management\u201d", "Author": "Monty P", "ReviewID": "UR131151576", "Content": "This place had become pretty bad under the old management, but under the new folks, it is great!

No complaints at all, just a little noisy due to construction next door and some late night guests checking in. No big deal though, nothing that kept me from sleeping or enjoying myself. This is not a Travel Lodge any longer. The condo's are owned by individuals and rented out. I noticed that a few of the people laying out by the pool knew each other, so I'm guessing that they live here or are frequent guests and have become friends over the years. If you have children, this is nice because it is gated and you can't get out to the beach unless you type a code into the gate. You also could not get back in to the condo without a code, keeping out unregistered guests. I liked it because we have a very curious 7 year old that will go wherever he wants and we have to watch him constantly. We were in a bottom unit. This was nice because the kids could go to the pool just outside the door and we could watch them from the kitchen while we prepared lunch or dinner.

I made the reservation on the Travelodge website, and I'm very disappointed that they didn't call me before my trip to tell me I wasn't going to stay at a Travelodge property. Once we got the key to the room, we understood why Travelodge pulled out. This place is a dive. When we arrived at 1 p.m., the office staff were on their way to getting pretty liqoured up. On our way to the room, we passed some \"employees\" that looked like ex-cons. Concerned about finding lodging the week of the race, we decided to stick it out. It was downhill from there. The carpet was FILTHY in the \"junior suite\" we were in; the dirt came off the furniture onto your clothing. The \"non-smoking\" room smelled like stale smoke, and we kept smelling \"something else\". We found out what that \"something else\" was the next day when we went to turn on the A/C, and found that someone had puked inside the air conditioner, and maintenance hadn't bothered to clean it out. We were given a new room, but the only room they had was a regular room with two double beds (when we were supposed to have a junior suite with a king bed). The second room was definitely cleaner, however, they wouldn't discount the room (even though it was a smaller room, and we had to sleep in separate beds). During our stay, someone jumped off a balcony into the parking lot. This person was clearly using; when I attempted to help, I could tell she was hallucinating. Very unsavory location/guests. My advice: if you want to stay beachside, stay at the hotels on NORTH Atlantic Avenue. The only decent looking hotel on SOUTH Atlantic was the Best Western Tiki. P.S.

I went down to the front desk to request a better room, I was told that i could check in at another hotel. I travelled from Pennsylvania and my family and I was too tired to look elsewhere. Ok. Very rude! After a few attempts we got tired and annoyed and took what we felt was the better of what we have seen. Still lousy though! This room had no light in the kitchen area. The door leading to the balcony was weather beatened and was peeled and the wood was rotten at the bottom and looked as if something, (probably from the sea) had chewed at it!

The window in the bathroom was tiny, dust, and had dead bugs in it. There were roaches in the shower.

The pressure in the shower wasnt so great took a long time to take a shower because of it maids didnt do too great if you were out on the balcony she only did good when you were physically gone down at the beach two pools were okay little salty pool hours were amazing for teens 6 am - 12 mid easy access to the beach if you want to go down to the pier and actually end up and the other side of the resturaunt bring money for the ride or pay up a dollar just to get to the other side the walk back to the hotel from the pier a mile away hurt the feet . if you wanted a can of soda you had to go down to the main level to get it next to the elevator which they wernt cold or in the lobby 25 cents more for cold ones the snack machine was well priced theres area for grilling which we did 4 nights of and picnic tables to sit at nice view of the ocean but i most likely wont go back because i didnt enjoy it like i wanted it to", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cNice place for the money\u201d", "Author": "jazzman89", "ReviewID": "UR5497301", "Content": "My wife and son went over to Daytona from Orlando.

Before leaving the lobby, the desk clerk used profanity infront of my kids and slammed the phone across the desk. This outburst was over another guy behind the counter refusing to do some kind of daily count and walking out in the parking lot for a cigarette break. I returned at 3:00pm and was told my room was not ready for check in and I asked if could see the manager. I was told that I would be charged for the room if I left and he would have my room cleaned right away. Before I could get out the door, the manager called the cleaning staff and discovered my room #224 was ready. Apparently the room was clean but the \"cigarette break\" guy was too lasy to check. The room was in horrible shape. The sofa bed was broken and we were not allowed to change rooms. My two boys had to sleep sagging downward. The room smelled of urine and gym locker room. There were spilled food stains in the refrigerator. The bathroom had hairs on the floor. The kicker to all this was the next morning when I was not able to get into the exercise room. The \"cigarette break\" guy refused to give my a key at 8:00am because I was checking out that morning. I said I would just get someone to let me in and he replied the police would be called to have me removed. He actually followed me back to my room to check if I went in the exercise room on the way!

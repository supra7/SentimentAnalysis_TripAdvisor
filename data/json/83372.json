I read all of the reviews prior. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a quant little place, which seemed very secure. I liked how it was isolated, with only one entrance & exit by the from office. The neighborhood wasn't \"bad.\" Yes, I saw a strip club on the other side of a major street. The parking lot of the club was virtually empty & I never saw anyone go in or out, nor did I hear a sound in 3 nights. This is in part because the club is not visible from the motel rooms or pool at all. People really make a bigger deal out of it than it is. The staff was nice. The continental breakfast was fine. Yes, it was just pastries, which is what continental generally means. I realize a lot of chain hotels offer full breakfasts now. That's not what this place is. IHOP is right there if you want eggs! The pool area was cute. One night the hot tub wasn't working well, but they fixed it while we were there & it was great after that. It's not a luxury resort. It's a perfectly fine place to sleep if you're more interested in spending time out and about and aren't ultra picky about accommodations. It's minutes from beaches, the bay, and major attractions. I personally like the convince of being close to fast food & Target, so it's not necessary to pay tourist prices for sun screen & snacks.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hesperia, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here.\u201d", "Author": "Windy2409", "ReviewID": "UR126872545", "Content": "We choose this hotel based on many things, however we didn't know that it was across the street from a strip club. The place seemed very sketchy, the whole time we were there which was a lot because we had bad weather, it didn't seem like a very safe or secure place. During one of our 3 night stay people were talking outside our door and the staff didn't do anything about it, however the staff was friendly. The room itself had had patches of wall paper that looked like it had been cut out and then just put right back in the same place where you could clearly see where it had been removed. The socks to plug in lights didnt cove the whole circle of a hole there was, the blow drier was jim riged to the light socket. I thought, plugging in my own stuff was going to catch the place on fire. Anytime someone in another room was flushing the toilet or showering it was as if they were doing it in your room. We had our daughter with us and so I brought bed sheets just incase and I'm glad I did. The bath towels weren't very soft, but when we asked for more we got more. The hot water took awhile to get hot, it was a warmish feel and with bad weather I wanted a hot shower. Overall, our experience was not the most pleasant. The breakfast that is included looked home made and it was coffee and some biscuit thing (didn't try it) IHOP was next door so we went there. We would never stay her again or recommend this motel to anyone else.

Nice clean room, and quiet, even though we were right next to the noisy elevator. Comfortable beds. Nice clean pool and jacuzzi. This is a no-frills place, with a minimal continental breakfast, but we did our research and knew this coming in. Reading some reviews, I don't understand how people are surprised by what they find after checking in. You need to do your research. That being said, overall we were only basically satisfied. We had reserved a KING room, and had the confirmation to prove it, but when we arrived we were given a 2 QUEEN room. They said we had been \"upgraded\" from \"a smaller room with only 1 bed to a bigger room with 2 beds\" that normally costs $10 more. We sleep in a queen bed at home, and wanted a king, which is why we reserved one. The lady acted like she was doing us a favor by giving us 2 beds instead of 1. Whatever. Now on to the free wi-fi. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel over 2 or 3 others near the same area and in the same price range was the free in-room wi-fi. The connection, when working, was strong and fast. When working. When it was up, it would stay connected anywhere from 1-15 minutes before dropping. It would take at least 5-10 minutes before it would come back up. Again for only 1-15 minutes. The longest it stayed connected was about 40 minutes around midnight the first night (Saturday). Sunday it was spotty until around 2PM, then it went down again until the next morning at around 9AM, 2 hours before checkout. The front desk said that yes, they were having problems with it, and had to keep resetting it, and that someone was coming in on Monday to take a look at it. Great. We were there for Saturday and Sunday. They told me that there was an internet cafe within walking distance, and a Kinkos about 3 blocks away. I had work I needed to do online, which I wanted to do from our room. Plus we were travelling home on Monday and the weather forecast called for possible snow along our route and I wanted to keep updated on the conditions. 2 of the 3 people we dealt with at the front desk were very courteous and helpful, apologizing for the issues we had. But the one that checked us in and out could really improve her personality. Upon checkout, she even claimed she knew nothing about the internet being a mess all weekend, though I'm pretty sure she was the first one I complained to on Saturday. Another guest said the same thing about her. So, the room was fine, other than the bed size. Property clean. Jacuzzi clean and hot. Just confirm you get the room you reserved, and that the wi-fi is working, if you plan or need to use it for more than a few minutes at a time.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson", "Title": "\u201cDirty!\u201d", "Author": "tucson2004", "ReviewID": "UR118083565", "Content": "The floors were so dirty we put towels down to walk on.

She was very helpful and friendly. She answered all my questions and gave us some restaurant ideas. There is an IHOP right next door, and we did eat there, the food was good. The walkways to our room made me a little nervous with all the changes in flooring height and sponginess. Good thing was an elevator since we were on the top floor. It was slow, but it worked. When we did get to our room, the carpets were in need of cleaning, the bathroom was ancient with a loose toilet seat and only one tiny shampoo - no soap, conditioner, or lotion, and the towels were very old. The air conditioner sounded like a frieght train, and the noise from the airport wasn't too pleasant. Planes constantly, all hours of the day and night. The continental breakfast was a JOKE!!! The coffee sucked! My child did like the pool (at least they had one, not the cleanest), but what does a little kid know about motels? The wi-fi did not even get a good enough signal to connect in my room. A lot of the tv channels had fuzzy reception. And I kinda freaked out when I saw there is a stripclub and a tatoo parlor right across the street, although we did not have any issues with either establishment's patrons. There were alot of families here, only for a quick place to sleep I imagine. For the price we paid (119 + tax) I expect better than a renamed dumpy old motel 6. When I told the day clerk / \"manager\" about our issues, she did not care one bit! She didn't even try to apologize, but made it sound like our fault re the wi-fi, ac, lack of stock in the bathroom, and the tv. I am planning another trip to this area, but I definately will not ever be back to this shabby shack, not even if they only charged $40 - which would still be overcharging.

When i went to the front desk to complain, the girl, her name is Danielle, extremely rude person, kept saying this has never happened and did not care to do anything about the situation. Basically called me a liar repeatedly saying that it has never happened and that there was nothing she could do. She pretended to call the manager, i never got a call from either manager. I told her that we will not be staying a second night and that i expected a full refund. I called Orbitz, who by the way, also very rude. They gave me the run around about the refund, spent an hour on the phone with them. I am still waiting on my refund, if i do not receive it within 5 days, i will be doing something about it.

Anyway, I thought the location was great-very easy access to the freeway system, about 10 minutes from the Zoo, there was an In N Out less than 1 half a mile away, and there was a trolley stop with free parking about 1 mile away. Also, IHOP is right next door, as well as tons of shopping like Ross, TJ Maxx, and restaurants, etc within a 1 mile radius. There was a pool as well as a hot tub-didn't try either. Ice and water just down the outdoor hall. No elevator-didn't bother us. Also, the ac/heating unit is the old type that is either on or off-it can't self regulate. So when we came back after a long day the room was cold. Not a big deal as the heater worked awesome and would heat our room up in a couple minutes. There was breakfast served every morning, but very limited hours (7a-9a). We missed it both mornings. Woke up too late the first morning, the second morning we left too early. That was kind of a bummer-it was one of the reasons I booked this place. There was a micro and well as a decent sized fridge in our room. Also, a desk and chair. Shower/tub combo and good water pressure. Our first night, the area was very quiet-we slept awesome. The next night was NYE, so of course it was pretty loud with the club nearby. But didn't bother me. Also, covered parking was nice and since the hotel is so small, parking is convenient to the room. The front desk lady was very helpful, showing us where the trolley stop is. She was very nice as well. Overall, I am giving the hotel 4 stars. (the hotel states it is a 2 star, and I think that is fair-maybe a 2.5 star). 1/2 star deduction because our room was not serviced by housekeeping at all the 2 nights we were there. Did we call and complain? Nah, didn't care that much. The other 1/2 star deduction is because of the very short breakfast hours.

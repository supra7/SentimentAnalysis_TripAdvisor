I am an owner at the Coconut Malorie Resort and have been since 2002. So I have seen this resort change ownership at least 4 times. Some for the good and others not so good. So to say I was surprised when I checked in was an understatement. Since 2007 whenever I checked I checked in, I had to do battle with the front desk staff. My wife has bad legs and 9 times out of 10 one or both of the elevators are down for repairs. I was told that since I check in on a Saturday I HAD to except an upper floor room. So this year again I was expecting another battle. Since Festiva Hospitality Group took over it was such a joy to check in. All new front desk staff were more then willing to accomondate us on a lower floor. It fact they were very happy because most people want a room on the upper floors and that freed up one more room for them. Check in went smoothly. As an owner, I can say that not much has changed. The rooms are quite roomy and bright. Still has a tiny kitchen area. No big deal but still quite crowded. Stil have the mismatched eating utensils and pots and pains have seen better days. But a BIG PLUS. Festiva has stopped the Fager's Island valets from using the resort parking lot to park cars.

I'll start from the beginning, when we checked in everything seemed great. The hotel was beautiful from the outside, front desk employees were friendly and welcoming. We got to our room and it seemed nice enough. We hit the AC on and discovered to our dismay that it just plain didn't work. So we attempted to open some windows....and none of the windows open. They aren't broken, they just don't open. So then we opened the french doors that had sliding doors onto the balcony and the sliding doors just kept coming off the track. Infuriating. So we dealt with all of those things and went out to explore. When we returned it was rather late. My boyfriend used the bathroom and the toilet clogged. We went down to the front desk and they gave us a plunger. This would be fine if it only happened this one time but it happened this time and every time we used the bathroom following. Can I tell you how mortifying it is to have a maintenance man come in to fix your very clogged toilet on your vacation? This happened over and over and they just would give us a plunger or send maintenance. Finally the night before we left, I spoke to a manager and he gave us a new room. This was appreciated but having to move all of our stuff the night before we leave was super frustrating. When we got to the new room, there was working AC and a good set of screen doors but I don't think they had changed the sheets before we went in. I found multiple hairs on the sheets that were not ours. If we weren't leaving the next morning (it also was about 1am when i went to bed), I would have complained. Then I attempted to plug my phone in to charge, when I put the charger in the outlet it fell out. No joke. All of the outlets in the living room were too large. They had lamps that we could not even plug in. How does that happen?! Also, I wish when we had booked we would have known that the pool would not be open and that more than half of Ocean City is closed unless it's the weekend. There was very little for us to do. Even restaurants closed before 5pm. There was no room service or even vending machines (with the exception of soda) so if you were hungry after 5pm, good luck. Good things: the bedding was soft and comfortable, the view was beautiful but I'm sure during the summer it is probably very buggy (right over marshy land) and loud (across from Fagers Island).

Just needed a mini getaway. Overall, the hotel was ok, a little old but they tried to update it. The lobby was nice. The rooms are old & musty and need renovation. The hotel is located on 59th and coastal hwy so it's a bit far from the boardwalk. 2 blocks from the beach. Free parking. My husband and I got there Friday night around 10pm after driving 4 hours and we checked in right away. The front desk person was nice and helpful. Went up to our room, but the key didn't work. So my husband went down to the front desk and took about 15 minutes then maintenance came up with him to fix the door. However, that took what seemed to be an hour to fix. The guy kept trying and trying but it didn't seem to work. Finally, around 11:20pm the door was fixed and we were able to relax in our room. (That was a turnoff) Also, The following morning we were awakened to noise and talking outside of our door. a couple of people were having a conversation for about 20 minutes and we could hear everything. My husband and I were very irritated by that. So,I got up and went down to get coffee and I saw the housekeeping cart out side our door. Which leads me to assume it was the housekeeping staff that was socializing (but this is only an assumption). We stayed in the one bedroom suite, and like I said it need updating. It overlooked the bay. The bathroom was a decent size but the fixtures need replacing. There was a 30'' TV in the living room and a very old TV in the bedroom that had horrible picture. The bed was very uncomfortable to sleep on. It also had a fully equipped kitchenette which was nice to have. (we didn't use it much) The complimentary coffee in the lobby was from 7am-11am. It was actually very good. We had about a cup each day. We asked for late check-out (12pm) and it wasn't a problem. Check-out was simple.

We had won a raffle and we could choose from a variety of hotels. We chose the Coconut Malorie because it wasn't too far from the city (3 hours drive from D.C.) Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewers. There is a very bad ant problem in this hotel (especially in the bathroom area/counters). We did report this problem to management and they didn't seem surprised. The entire hotel has a very musty/mildew smell. The workout room has a treadmill (probably from the 70's) and due to the musty smell in the area, it was hard to breathe while working out. Our room had a musty smell as well. There is a kitchenette but we were grossed out by all the rust around the appliances. We didn't dare to use any of the dishes/silverware that were in the cabinets.

It was a timeshare trade through RCI. I read some of the reviews and was concerned about the place. When I got there, I was completely surprised. First, the front desk. The people are not rude, they are Russian, and I am not saying that in a bad way. I found out, as you go through Ocean city, the boardwalk, the restaurants, everywhere, there is a Russian exchange for the summer. These people are here learning to work. Learning the language, and let's face it, they are not what Americans expect. So their personalities are just different than ours. So I found no problems once you started talking to them, or asking for assistance. Overall they were nice people at the front desk and pretty much everywhere throughout the city. We had a studio apartment. It was huge compared to what I expected. Nice comfortable bed, small living room hide a bed and a dining room set. Also a kitchenette with a full fridge and microwave. The bathroom was huge with a jetted tub. And not once did we run out of water. We were overlooking the pool and the pool was great also. Every morning the maintenance people were out testing and vacuuming the pool. I was also amazed at the maid service every day. Typically with a timeshare swap, you get towel change once a week. But they were there every day. There really is no activity at the resort. They have a huge lobby that is pretty much just for decoration. Nothing planned that I could see. So you have to use Ocean City as your activitiy and I am sure you should have no problem doing that. The beach is right across the street, about a 5 minute walk and you can rent umbrellas and chairs for the day. Overall, we would go back. This is a fantastic place for all ages. If you want to party, there are plenty of bars and bands. If you have kids, the beach and the boardwalk are fantastic. One thing I would recommend, is make some of your own meals.

Upon arriving just walking in to the hotel was beautiful with the staircase and the waterfall. check in was VERY easy and we had the top floor .. when we walked into the room we were in amazement! The living room had a dining table, a nice sofa beautiful tile floor, and an excellent view! We were in astonishment because we only paide 180 for the room, and it was incredible .. we then went further to look on, and we found a tiled bathroom with a large jacuzzi bathtub, and the mirror with lightbulbs going down the side. It was like we were watching scarface! I couldnt find the bedroom but then my boyfriend opened these large doors which led us into a spacey room, with a large closet- extra pillows, blanket, and an iron! The towels actually went all the way around my body and they weren't tiny, like most hotels, and there were FOUR towels! The view was also amazing. 7-11 is right down the street and you can walk there at 1am for taquitos! On the down side, check out is at 10 am, while check in is at 4 pm. If you are staying on the bay side, you will here the club/restaraunt until atleast 1am. But the balcony was atleast 60ft from our bedroom, so we couldnt hear it from the living room. The hotel is pretty far from the boardwalk, but it was easy enough to pay 10$ for the day to park in a parking lot. In the long run you are saving yourself money.

Cons: The halls, lobby and room had a musty smell. The room itself was so bad I had to go out and buy plug-ins to overcome the smell. I also bought lysol and sprayed down the sofa, carpet and drapes.

At night the hall lights are pretty dim so it can be a little creepy coming back to your room after dark. The towels were thin and the blanket had a hole in it, while the sheets were patched in places and thin. The game room is nothing more than a library with a pool table in it. The fitness room is upstairs past that, and has a few machines (treadmill, eliptical, bike). The website pictures are very misleading, the room shown is of the presidential suite which is not available to timeshare owners, just those willing to pay for it on a day to day basis.

There was other people's hair on the floor, clearly the bathroom floor hadn't been really cleaned in years, if ever. Same with the bottom of the tub. The bathroom towels had holes in them and had me wondering if I was cleaner prior to the shower?! The comforter on the bed must have been 30 years old without ever being cleaned. The couch in the room was so old I would never sit on it - very dirty and something you would see on the side of a road with a FREE sign hanging on it.

Let me start by saying that we are timeshare owners with Fairfield. I had an active search going with RCI for at least five years trying to book a week of vacation at the Coconut Malorie ... finally success, and I was so excited. About 2 weeks prior to check in I started researching things to do in Ocean City when I came across some reviews of the Coconut Malorie on trip advisor. I was shocked and disappointed to learn about the mold issues. Because I am highly allergic to mold, I promptly called the resort, and my fears were put to rest by the hotel staff. Still, I was a little hesitant. Upon entering the lobby for check in, I was certain that the reviews were accurate. The entire lobby smelled stale and moldy ... I was dredding what I would find in the room (208). The room was terrible. Mold on the walls and the ceilings near the air vents. The refrigerator was disgusting, and I was worried for my health. Being the optimist, my husband thought we should give it one night and see how we felt in the morning. The next day we changed rooms to the first floor (109). The room was still a little moldy, but nowhere near as bad as the first room. In hindsight, we should have called RCI and demanded our deposit back. This almost ruined our vacation. Outside of the mold issue, the pool area was pretty pathetic. It looked like at some point it had a pool bar ... but no longer. The hot tub looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, and I was horrified when I saw people actually get in it. We did not have an issue with sales calls as indicated in other reviews because we unplugged our phones. (my daughter like to play with the phones). The other reviews that spoke of the 8am wake up call by the trash truck at Fager's Island is accurate and surprisingly loud! I will say that the front desk worker that handled finding us another room was very attentive to my health concerns with the mold. She even coordinated maintenance to help me move my luggage because my husband was unavailable for a few hours. Something tells me she has had a lot of experience dealing with mold complaints. We will never stay here again, and I will always consult trip advisor before booking with our timeshare again. RCI needs to reconsider if this should be classified as a 'Gold Crown Resort.'

A half dozen yellow roses in the room, some coupons to lunch ($20 off) and dinner ($50 off) at Fager's island and some muffins/OJ in the fridge.... dinner at Fager's was good, but we essentially paid the full price of the meal with the cost of the couple's package (and then some!) So definitely skip that if you are desperate enough to need to book a room here. On to the room... it was TERRIBLE, especially considering the price!! I have stayed in many Hiltons, Marriotts, Embassy Suites for roughly the same price per night and NEVER have I seen such a state of disrepair in a hotal room. The cabinets drawers in the kitchenette were old and misaligned .... same in the bathroom where one handle was completely broken off. Several shower curtain hooks were broken and missing, the bath towels were so old - they actually had HOLES in them (!!), the caning on the chairs in the living room was pulled off, the tile floor near the balcony was chipped and missing huge chunks (making barefoot walking hazardous). The bedroom dresser was missing several drawer pulls, the paint in all of the rooms was dirty and chipped in many places, and the fitted sheet on the bed looked and felt like it was 15 years old - not smooth, but \"picky\" and falling apart - I slept on top of the flat sheet. The extra blanket in the closet smelled like sour milk. Overall, I can't believe that management can actually ignore such minor fixes that make all the difference in the quality of a stay for a guest. It is true, as others have written - they have a beautiful lobby and one of the workers was re-painting the curb on the day we left. Why not pay some attention to the GUEST ROOMS?? They actually had the nerve (standing in the beautiful lobby and handing out free wine) to ask if we would sit through a 1 1/2 hour \"spiel\" on buying one of their timeshare units.

They had charged us for the first night even before we had arrived! I was so disgusted upon our checkout, (yes the early 10:00 am) I couldn't even bring myself to voice the issues. Had the naive checkout girl asked about the quality of our stay (obviously they don't care to know because she didn't ask), I would have blasted the poor girl.

Overall, my hubby and I did have a nice weekend in OC and surpisingly we enjoyed Cruiser's Weekend and seeing all of the old restored cars driving up and down the main drag. We had some good food, good weather and fun walking the boardwalk. The Coconut Malorie was the ONLY negative - thank goodness we didn't spend much time in the room.

The review titled \"Watch out for bed bugs\" scared me enough to contact the hotel via email. I got a response the same day and was satified that the property had properly addressed the situation. So off we went. The property is located 1 block from the beach and about 30 blocks from the boardwalk. The lobby is very nice and has 2 computers with internet access which guests can use for free. There is also free coffee available for guests 24/7. The entire property is SMOKE-FREE and there is a HEFTY fine of $500 if you indulge. Other amenities include a small pool and a tower which has a pool table, a library, a ping pong table and a workout room. While we were waiting to check in we overheard two other guests complaining about their room. After hearing them we expected the negative reviews might be correct. When we got to our room we went through it with a fine tooth comb and especially checked for bed bugs (there were none). We wrote down a list of things that were problems, but not 'deal breakers' and called the front desk. They sent maintenance and housekeeping to our room to address the problems and with only a few more problems arising later which were, again, addressed, we continued our stay. We had a one bedroom with a pull-out sofa for our teenager. The room has 2 TVs, and a DVD player with the TV in the living area. It also included a small balcony, a whirlpool tub and a very new and clean kitchenette with a microwave. We also had a nice view of the bay. A small bridge takes you to Fager's Island restaurant. The staff was very nice. The trash truck, does, indeed come early in the morning to Fager's Island, and does make a lot of noise. The walls of the room are thin enough that we could hear people talking within, I'd guess, about 20 ft. of our room. *** I think it should be said that the property is not exactly a hotel in the normal since of the word. It seems the Coconut Malorie is a hybrid of a hotel, a time-share and a condo. We were approached by a salesman connected with the property who tried to get us see a 'demo' about the property \"and find out more about us\". We didn't take him up on his offer (timed very poorly as we were on our way to dinner). This system may explain why there are so many divergent reviews. Our unit might have a very good owner, other units may have owners who don't take care of them. The owners may have to pay extra for maintenance; the unowned property could go unattended until booked... you get the idea. Housekeeping obviously does not communicate to management the problems that exist in a unit. We know this because when we handed our list of problems to the front desk, the manager said \"thanks for telling us, because otherwise, how would we know?\" Well, management SHOULD know. And unless they start talking to each other, it's obviously up to the guest to make sure they list EVERY LITTLE THING and report it to management so it can be addressed and you won't get charged.

We felt like leaving as soon as we got there, but figured since it was only for one night it wouldn't matter.... in reality we should have slept in the car. Upon arrival, they require you sign a document with a whole list of 'rules' to be obeyed or there would be penalties to pay. We stay at a lot of hotels on business, and never have problems as we are model guests. We even put up with a lot and don't complain. But I was a bit suspicious nonetheless. And rightly so, as my credit card was charged over $500 extra after we left. Repeated calls back to the hotel went unanswered. They keep telling us the Manager is not there today. Messages on his/her answering service are not returned. We have yet to hear the explanation for the extra charges, even though we left the place in better shape than the way we got it. (btw, and we don't steal towels or anything else from hotels... that's lame and we don't want their stuff). We now sincerely beleive they routinely rip people off as often as they can. As for the condition of things, we must agree with the other negative comments about the hotel: The two elevators are verrrry slow and shaky. No bellhop service to take our luggage up. The hallways are hot and smelly. The carpets are old and stained, and the walls look like they haven't been painted in years. The room was dirty and musty smelling. Dirty carpets and floors (our feet turned black). Mold in the bathroom and stagnant water was in the tub. The bed was uncomfortable and worn out. The TV remote did not work, nor did the alarm clock. I asked for a wakeup call and never got it (checkout is at 10AM). The balcony is too small to sit on, overlooking a dirty swamp between the hotel and the nearby 'island'. Noise from the nightclub on that island goes on till about 3:00AM, with people yelling, screaming and carrying on. Taxis buzz in and out to shuttle crowds back and forth throughout the night. The view of the sunset was nice, but with all the noisy seagulls, birds and smelly swamp it was not worth it. The staff is nonresponsive and of no help. So if you still think this might be a nice place to stay, take your chances. When they bill you over $600 for a nights stay at this dump, don't say we didn't warn you.

Plus, we were unable to have firm dates so many other places were booked (Hilton, Holiday Inn). Once again, we have found another overpriced OC hotel that is underwhelming. My husband and I brought our 18 month old and my mother along with us for the trip. We got the 2 room suite thinking either us or Mom could stay on the sofa bed. Upson arrival we were treated fine, but not offered any bell service to get our 2 luggage carts up to the room. After an evening on the boardwalk, we returned at 10 to find there was no bedding available for the sofa bed! WHAT A JOKE! The mattress was incredibly thin and we wern't offered a mattress pad. Repeated calls to the front desk went unanswered and my husband went down there to get some assistance. We were not given a blanket, but the offered a comforter to provide extra padding for the mattress! The sheets they gave us were king size to go onto a full size sofa bed! The bedroom was OK, but felt dated and dirty. The kitchen area and living room were nice and made a great place to hang out after the baby went to sleep. However, the door to the bedroom (where we put her pack and play) was similar to a shutter and sound and light passed right through. Fortunately, she was so sleepy it didnt matter. The bathroom was a pleasant surprise. The whirlpool was nice and there were always extra towels provided. We didn't appreciate the 10am phone call from housekeeping notifying us we were the last room left to clean (we found that very hard to believe). So, we were rushed from our room each day for housekeeping. The housekeepers were rude. Overall, the hotel has a LOT of potential, but it is obvious they are trying to make you feel that you are in a nicer place than you really are. The customer service is lacking and attention to detail is absent! I don't think we will be back. Next year we are thinking of going to the HIlton or Holiday Inn (but booking earlier) ....or we will skip OC all together and head down to VA beach for a cleaner, more affordable vacation.

He was very nice and promised to send us a certificate for two free nights at the hotel and also said he would \"show us what true hospitality is\". I was satisfied with that. I live less than 10 miles from the hotel and four weeks later I had still not received anything from the hotel. I then e-mailed him to inquire about our two free nights.

If you want to relax, this is not the place for you. The noise from Fager's goes late into the night (especially bad on weekends). Quite a few of the tenants were teens and a bit noisy. The overall grounds are kepy fairly nice. I have to believe that the only people who rave about this place must be owners.", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cVery Shady!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3666878", "Content": "The Coconut Malorie is a decent place to say. However, I try to tell as many people as I come across not to stay there since my wife and I stayed there two summers ago. We had an ok time at Ocean City, Md and the resort definitely is beautiful. However, when we returned home and found that our credit card was billed an extra $200.00 by Coconut Malorie, we were a little shocked. I called the credit card company, and they told me to ask the resort. So after many phone calls not returned by management, being hung up, and disconnected (and this was all before my inquiry); I finally got through. I was told that I stole two bathrobes, which each cost $100. Now, I know none of you know me, but I did not steal any bathrobes. So if you want the biggest hassle of your life and someone accusing you of theft, go ahead and stay at Coconut Malorie. But hey, It does look very nice.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful!\u201d", "Author": "clbalo", "ReviewID": "UR3656941", "Content": "We just returned from the Coconut Malorie. We stayed there during the week of July 4th. From the room to the service received, everything was wonderful. Everything needed to cook a meal was included in the kitchenette. The bathroom is Huge! The view from the balcony was lovely. The noise that I expected from Fagers Island was barely noticeable (unless you kept the sliding door open). The decor of the room is very nice. The rooms look like they could be found in a tropical resort. I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cvery disappointed\u201d", "Author": "galemelmer", "ReviewID": "UR3355317", "Content": "well we just returned and will never go back ...for 109...they placed us first in a dirty room, the girl at the front desk was disheveled looking but the lobby looked new and inviting.we got to the room.which was ok.but not sparkling clean.the hotel is not well lit and kind of scary in some areas.for 10 dollars more we could have been ocean front at the holiday inn.the elevators are a disaster old scratched.and they started drilling in the room under us at 845 am !", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Coconut Malorie", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d89498-Reviews-Coconut_Malorie-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$74 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">200 59th Street on the Bay</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "89498", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/44/1b/441bd5ad74df247e7200f4db770cd2483large.jpg"}}

This is an above average typical USA hotel....very little character. The management were friendly and helpful. One thing we didn't like was the very abrupt breakfast finish and the attitude of the breakfast staff ..exactly at 0930hrs every breakfast \"machine\" was switched off and items cleared away with no warning...any requests for food were instantly dismissed....arriving at 0920hrs to a packed breakfast room meant very little breakfast available for us!

The next morning I asked if we could have another room because of the length of our stay we really needed a room with an easy chair.I was told the only way I could get a room with a chair was to book a suite.If we weren't meeting family members there later in the week, we would have left. When they did arrive with the same reservations, we found that all the rooms had a chair.Shame on you @ the front desk for lying!You got caught.Not only that,when you walk down the hall and housekeeping is cleaning you can see in the rooms and they had easy chairs! Guess you think one to be supid. SECOND, our toilet was clogged first use.The young lady who came up said she would have maintence look at it. Apparently not, had to call them 3 times! The first full day we began having problems getting he door to open once the card was put in the lock and the light turned green. At first thought it was me. But, everyone entering our room had the same problem. Told the front desk one evening when we were coming back in from our day of activities. He said ok-someone would look at it. Nothing done and nothing said about it. Then one day when I was struggling to get in one of the cleaning ladies helped me. The door knob was backwards and pushed up, instead of down like everywhere else I've stayed. All that would have been necessary was for someone to have told us this-there would have been no problem. As far as I'm concerned they do not care to make a guest's stay pleasant. Except for the young man that was on duty the night we checked in, the front desk peronel were less than pleasant. THIRD-The cleaning staff was impecable. The rooms were clean. Even smelled clean after they were in. I was very impressed to have a clean bedspread put on the bed after about 3 days. They were the only ones that deserve an \"atta boy\". Breakfast staff was ok. Not overly pleasant either. Other visits to this area we have stayed at Holiday Inn & Suies/Kendall Airport. I will go back there. They are pleasant, helpful. No problems with them. Great place. Though at the time we felt like it was away from things, it really isn't.

We stayed at this hotel because it had good reviews on TA, and because it could accomodate us all --2 adults, 4 children ages 11, 9, 6 and 3. We have been on many trips with these children, to various locations in the US, and never encountered this problem before. After the first night, my oldest grandaughter announced she had been bitten by something. We had been to the pool, and out and about in hot, hot hot Miami, so I dismissed it. She kept getting more bites...no one else did, After we had been there 4 nights, her brothers discovered an insect on the fold-out sofa bed (she and her little sister had slept on this bed the night before--only one night. My husband killed the insect andsaved the evidence. I went downstairs and did some research on the hotel computer. WALA! We had bedbugs! I told the manager(who did not at first admit to being the manager) very quietly, because at the time I was not sure how I was going to handle the situation. We agreed to move to another floor in the hotel because I was not sure we could find accomodations for the rest of our stay, AND, I guess I was hoping for the best. We also were given 3 days off our bill. We did not see any more evidence of the little critters. However, I could not enjoy the rest of the stay because I kept wondering if I had made the right decision for my family. When we arrived home, the childrens' mother noticed several bites on the 2 little boys, which did not come until the evening of the day we returned home. Their doctor informed us that sometimes you will not see bites until as much as 24 hours after being bit. The real reason I decided to blow the whistle on this hotel is, I'm afraid there might have been bugs in the SECOND room, also!!! On another note: The breakfast was not spectacular AND the living room configuration in both rooms made it impossibe to get around the room when the bed was out---a fire hazard, I'm sure.

We have two little ones (4 and 5) that go to bed very early, so we appreciate a hotel room with a separate bedroom so my wife and I don't have to go dark and quiet at 8 PM. In that respect, the hotel was great. The room was configured with a separate living room and a bedroom with a real door in between. The room itself was a little awkwardly shaped. The living room was long an narrow with the TV at one end, and a sofa at the other. The TV was small-ish (about a 20 in widescreen) and was about 15 feet from the sofa, so TV watching was odd at best. The room did have the Bathroom off of the Living Room instead of the Bedroom, so that is another plus in our situation. The room also had a refrigerator, a microwave, and a coffee maker, so we were able to keep food in our room and heat up stuff for the girls to eat. The breakfast was a bit lacking, in my opinion. Most hotels now have the waffle maker, so that is not a big deal. Aside from waffles, your choice was cereal (3 types), yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, sausages that you had to heat yourself in the microwave, toast, and bagels, and a basket of oranges and apples. There was milk and a variety of juices. Better than nothing, but I have seen better at less expensive hotels. Their coffee is hotel-standard Maxwell House, which in my opinion is awful. They did also have a small selection of teas (mostly chamomile). The Fitness room consisted of a treadmill, a bike, and an elliptical trainer. That was it. The location was absolutely great! without having to leave the mall parking lot, you had several options for food (including a pretty good Cuban restaurant), as well as a Publix and a CVS. The location is convenient to the Turnpike, and just off of Kendall Drive which is a major East-West artery in the Kendall area. You are less than 30 min from the beaches, and about an hour out of the Keys. All in all, for our type of travel to Miami which involves visiting a lot of family, with an occasional trip to the beach, this location is great.

Our room was extremely clean, climate controlled, nicely decorated and spacious. In the bathroom, we each had our \"private little giggle\" as we discovered that the full length mirror was hanging on the door directly facing the toilet (sorry, I had to throw that in : ) Free breakfast is included and it was one of the best complementary breakfasts that I've seen offered by any hotel we've ever stayed at - they had a nice selection of cereals, juices, muffins, hard boiled eggs, fresh fruits and you can even make your own waffles! The breakfast bar was always tended to and stocked. The neighborhood that the hotel is located in is a combination of a shopping plaza (Publix, CVS and post office to name of few stores), office buildings and some residential housing. We felt safe the entire time we were there. Parking at the hotel is free, and there were plenty of spaces. We've found our favorite hotel in Miami, and since we go back numerous times throughout the year, we will definitely be staying at County Inn and Suites again.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, good rooms, fine breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Rocks19", "ReviewID": "UR25965279", "Content": "We had to stay in Miami for over a week at a place near the Baptist Hospital and were very glad we found the Country Inn.

It was super clean, everything worked, the staff was friendly and professional. Free parking (a real plus in Miami), free breakfast, free coffee and cookies all day, and free USA Today. The entire motel is NON-SMOKING, no exceptions. The near-by mall was only half finished with a complete refurbishing when we were there, but had several decent restaurants and a Publix super market.

In any event, there were three pillows for two of us all flat of course, but at least one of us had two pillows, the in room fridge made so much noise we had to unplug it. The ashtray still had ashes in it. The front desk clerk, did not confirm any details with me upon check in nor did she upon check out (I believe it was the same clerk), initially gave me the wrong key, did not give me any information on the property or surrounding areas and gave me attitude instead of trying to help me with my problem.

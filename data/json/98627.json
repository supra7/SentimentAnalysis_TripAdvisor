The staff was absolutely wonderful. They were courteous, quick and loved my daughters. They even rewarded them for being so quiet and polite during breakfast. Their breakfast was my only complaint. We got downstairs about 40 minutes before breakfast was over and there was not much left and we had to wait for more food and clean glasses. Since we had to pay an additional $10 for it they least they could have done was have it ready and plentiful for those who paid.

A block of rooms was reserved for us at an outstanding rate of $49.00 per night. I've stayed here before, but I thought I'd update my reveiw. The hotel is immaculately maintained. If you've been in one Courtyard, you've been to this one, so no surprises here. I must say that the bed was too soft. I had a back-ache from our 15 hour drive and frankly the mushy matress did nothing for it. Everyone else liked the beds though. I'm a weirdo who likes a hard bed. Nice big bathroom, great water pressure, plenty of room to spread out and enjoy life. Kids went in the pool, and I enjoyed a nightly soak in the hot tub. There's one washer and one dryer on the property at $1.00 per load. Went to the laundromat down the street and did my wash there in very short order. Starbucks is to the right at Webb Chapel. Movie theater is there too. Quick Trip next door is an awesome convenience store with hot and cold food items (that are very tasty) and probably the best donuts anywhere. Very reasonably priced (as opposed to The Market) Our maid was awesome never disturbing us, the front desk did everything possible to help us out and even gave us some pennies for a game we could play on our trip back to Atlanta.

My room was typical, traditional-style Courtyard, - very clean, with 2 double beds, desk, bureau with flat screen TV, and closent. Bathroom was clean, with thirsty towels and some basic amenities. I was on the 3rd floor, and the elevators are a fair distance from the lobby - not a big deal but worth noting. Location is on Forest Lane, just off Josey Lane, just south of I-635; about 15-20 minutes from the DFW airport. There is nothing special about this hotel - good or bad. It's your typical, traditional Courtyard style hotel, and if you want something clean, comfortable, and simple, you'll get it here. Hotel often goes on sale for weekend stays - enter code \"MEB\" when doing a search on marriott.com (this code is for weekend specials), and see if this hotel appears, before booking at a higher rate. I paid $44/night, which made it an excellent deal for the price - not much higher than Motel 6, but far better. The only issue I ran into is the water pressure in the shower - and this has been noted in other reviews. The hotel appears to use water-conserving shower heads, and while it's nice that they think \"green,\", it would be even nicer to get a nice, powerful rush of water when stepping into the shower in the morning. The water pressure isn't bad, but it could be better. Bottom line -- decent hotel, especially at special weekend rates.

Upside: Price was right. Alfredo, the night clerk was extremely helpful, as was Jesus for breakfast in the morning. Room was clean. Downside: No water pressure in the shower. Only got good water pressure when we turned the water to the full on position which was very hot. In-room, complimentary internet access was non-existant. At least we couldn't access the net and there were no instructions in the room. Since we're not techies, we did without. We asked for a room on the first floor. Although the place was almost empty, they gave us a room facing out, rather than into the courtyard. Very disappointed in this since our room had a patio door leading onto the parking lot. I would expect that unless requested, or unless the hotel was full, they'd assign inward facing first floor rooms FIRST. Then fill in with outward facing rooms as needed.

I checked Holiday Inn brands and then looked out the window and seen the Court Yard across the street from my house and decided to check them in Dallas. Went online and checked prices and compared them to the Holiday Inn and seen they were pretty much the same so i booked online with this property. I decided to leave a day early and called to see if I could get the same rate if I arrived earlier and they said no, called reservations and they went ahead and gave me the same rate for both nights (Thurs and Fri $47/night with AAA). Exiting off the LBJ I realized that this part of town does not look the best. It is the kind of area that has the corner beer/wine store and some thugs hanging out, but I did not let that bother me I felt I was well protected. I arrived at the hotel and checked in and was given room 345 on the third (top) floor.The room was clean but rather small compared to other places I have stayed. It had a 42in LCD cable TV and small bathroom, patio area you could sit on (well, mine you could stand, it was one of the only ones with not furnature) if you wanted to brave the Dallas heat. I then walked to the desk to see what dining options there was since the hotel only serves breakfast. Although the clerk was friendly upon check-in he seemed to act as if coming back was a bother. Friday I got up and went for breakfast. They have a breakfast buffet with waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuts and gravy and a few other things. The breakfast was ok but nothing to write home about, and this is where i think the Holiday Inn has them beat. They charge $10.95 during the week and for the same food it is $11.95 on the weekend and the food in just plain, nothing special. What I like about Holiday Inn is that if I buy breakfast for me the kids eat free but not so at Court Yard. On Friday when my kids arrived I inquired about the Sponge Bob packages they were suppose to have for kids, it included a pillow case and some entertainment packs and I think a float toy for the pool, but nobody knew anything of it even though they had it advertised around the property. One thing I did not like was that they check out out in the middle of the night and go ahead and charge your credit card. I would prefer to see my bill and pay with the method of my choosing, but i admit I had planned on using that card, but in a lot of cases I just pay with cash. Had my bill been wrong I would have had to wait for reversals and such since they charged me as they did. Over all the place is nice, not as nice as the photos online make it look, but what place is as good as its pics? My bigget complaint was the pillows, they were so thin that it was like not having them. The bed itself was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on but the pillows did not provide me with a great night sleep. One thing to note, although the area is not the best, I walked around a bit and felt safe during the day, I did not venture out at night.

The hotel is not near any major restaurants or bars within walking distance; it is close to the airport. However, with Priceline, you get random hotel choice on a bid, but the star quality rating is solid. That said, I checked into the room and the a/c was off. I watched TV and it went out, so I took a nap while the cable repairman worked on it. While sleeping, I felt a tickle of sweat on my neck. I wiped it away only to find it wasn't sweat but a large cockroach. I threw it against a wall and screamed while another roach crawled up my bare leg. The roach on the wall scurried into my shoe, and I was able to capture it under a water glass (I took a video and picture). I called the desk enraged; demanding they relocate me to another Marriott and comp my stay. I also demanded to speak to a manager and have one come up to witness the roach. The clerk got in touch with the manager, but, instead of the manager talking to me, he left the clerk in charge. A maintenance man came up to the room and verified it was a very large roach. The clerk said they would not pay for me to go to another hotel and offered to switch rooms. This was unacceptable. They did credit my Priceline payment and, instead of walking me to another Marriott at a comparable rate, they gave me a Priceline operator and had me make a reservation at another hotel. They refused to pay for my 1st hotel night stay or offer any other compensation. For the record: Priceline would have refunded my money, so the manager was not doing me any favors. I called Marriott Corp as the manager would only communicate via email and through his clerk (apparently). Corp kept sending me back to the manager, where he offered me a 2-night stay next time I'm in town along with a template letter apology. I explained that they owed my company the difference in cost between what I paid for the Marriott vs where I made last minute reservations via Priceline. I also called Priceline and Marriott Corp saying that this hotel should be stripped of their Marriott banner and/ or be dropped (at least) two stars for poor management and infestation. The manager continued to sugar coat the cockroach's description by calling it a Palmetto Bug and Waterbug.

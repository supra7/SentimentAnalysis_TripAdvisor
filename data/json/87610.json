Our choices were Denver or Chicago so we picked Chicago. This was an unexpected/extended trip so we didn't have a hotel or car lined up and not much money left. We started making calls to hotels in the airport using the phones provided down the escalator. Well, the big hotel chains (Hampton Inn, Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn) were all $170 - 200 a night. Then we called the Four Points Sheraton because I am a starwood preferred guest and I get points for staying there. We didn't call their first because it didn't say \"Midway\" and we thought it was further away than the others (but it wasn't). Well, they changed their name to Chicago Midway Airport Hotel (new ownership) and no longer were a part of the point programs. However, their rates were only $119 a night for a room with 2 beds. I KNOW!!! I couldn't believe my ears. And, they would come & get us for free and they offered a free shuttle to the subway & airport every half hour. Since we were going to be there for 3 days without a car that was ideal. Although I was thinking that this might be in a bad part of town or crappy rooms but we just couldn't afford to stay in the Marriott. So we took a chance and it was the quality of a Sheraton and not far from the bigger expensive hotels. We are talking 1/4 of a mile from the other hotels on the same street. The rooms were really nice, the restaurant had great food and employees were nice & helpful. We had a small issue with a slow draining tub and they fixed it immediately. Oh & free morning coffee always makes me happy! They have an outdoor pool that was well maintained and I think was heated and a work out room. We walked to Applebees & had dinner and it was great. There's also a hometown Buffet that you can walk to on the same side of the street. There was an Olive Garden across the street & down the road a little but I wasn't comfy crossing 4 lanes of traffic so we skipped Olive Garden. The hotel is right next door to a shopping mall if you needed anything you could walk & get it. What a great deal! Save your money & stay here. Thanks Chicago Midway Airport Hotel for making our unexpected say so great and affordable!

On June 20th I received a email that it was no longer a 4points. I was a bit worried about why it had changed. However, I tried to keep an open mind about the situation. I booked the motel for $89/nt when other motels in the area were going for $199/nt. We were only staying 1 night, after the Jimmy Buffett Concert at Toyota Park. After getting the email notification I checked on some other motels in the area and they were all booked up. So, we got there, checked in and headed up to the room. We were on the 4th floor. The carpets in the hall way were very stained and in need of some deep cleaning. The room was relatively clean, but smelled musty. We checked for bed bugs before committing to stay (there were none). There was a thermostat on the wall to control to control the temp. We set it on 72 and it only kicked on 1 time during the night, making it feel very stuffy. Noise from the hallway made it seem like other people were trying to enter our room. The King size bed was comfortable. The shower had very little pressure. When we went to check out the housekeeping lady was sitting in the doorway of another room, talking to another employee. She asked us what room we were checking out of. I found this slightly unprofesional. When we got around the corner to the elevator there was a mop bucket blocking the elevator. Maybe it belonged to the other employee? The area where the motel is located seemed decent. I felt safe, even when returning after 11pm from the concert, and I tend to be paranoid. There was an outdoor (small) pool and a restaurant. We didn't use either, so I can't comment. I probably wouldn't stay here again, unless they undergo a major renovation. The motel is just old and run down. There are plenty of other motels closer to Midway/Toyota Park and they appear much newer. There is also a starbucks located among those motels, for you coffee drinkers. I've stayed at all types of motels/hotels in the past and I would rank this closer to a DaysInn or Motel 6. Not horrible, but not great.

The driver was very nice and helpful with our bags. During the drive, he made small talk with us about our weekend. Upon arrival to the hotel, we entered a very small lobby. The desk staff was also very nice and gave us information about the hotel amenities. We then went up to our room. We arrived at the door to our room. It stated \"Starwood (something)\". Anyway, we thought the room would be of the same quality of the downtown location. The room was large with a king size bed and a couch with a hide away bed. The problem was that the room either was a former \"smoking\" room or just really musty. The smell was something we just had to get use to being that most of Midway flights were cancelled causing the rooms to fill up. As for cleanliness, we really did not have any complaints. Everything was very clean in the room, just old. Wanting to check out the area, my wife and I decided to go outside and kill some time. We did go over to the mall next door for a while, however Target, Costco, and other businesses were across a very busy street. If you feel daring enough to cross this street at night during a snowstorm, go ahead. My wife and I just returned to the hotel. We went to the 24 hr cafe in the hotel. There was a very limited menu. We ended up just splitting a club sandwich which was actually pretty good. I guess under the circumstances, the hotel wasn't all that bad. The best way that I can describe it would be \"tired\". Everything just seemed old, outdated. It wasn't on the same level as the 4 pts. downtown. Would I stay there again?

I looked into many of the properties around the Midway Airport area\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6where I needed to be (57th & Pulaski) and found the properties either booked OR very expensive for one night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6between $200 and $259 per night. Not wanting to spend that much, I chose to go online and see what was available nearby. Just going a few extra blocks past the Midway Centre, I was able to locate the Four Points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sheraton and got two (2) rooms for about $129 each! The two rooms were very clean and comfortable. The lobby was small but nice and the 24-hour restaurant on site, which my family used to have dinner around 10PM that night, was very good and the service friendly.

We've been to Chicago several times and will be moving to the city soon, so we didn't mind sacrificing a couple of days in the city in exchange for saving serious money (we ended up spending $119/night on a weekend when everything downtown was going for at least $250 or more). The hotel actually exceeded my expectations in terms of staff friendliness and overall room quality. The free shuttle to and from the airport is a HUGE bonus (they'll take you there to catch the El as well). We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at 11 am - they actually already had a room ready for us to check in after being fully booked the night before. All of the staff were pleasant and helpful. There is a decent gym and an outdoor pool if you have kids interested in swimming. Another bonus is that the hotel is right within short walking distance of a large mall and a movie theater, as well as plenty of other stores/shops. The hotel restaurant actually has decent food, and is open 24 hours. The only complaints I have about the experience would be that the free wireless was not strong on all areas of the building (we had to shift in our room to pick up the signal, but we were eventually successful, so I wasn't overly upset). The only other issues were that our tub drained slowly and the room had an under window unit air conditioner, which is just a little annoying because the room does not stay temperature controlled very easily (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either on continuously and the room ends up getting pretty cold or you have to turn it completely off).

I had a chicken and fresh vegetables with a light white wine sauce that was very, very good and (even!) was garnished beautifully.

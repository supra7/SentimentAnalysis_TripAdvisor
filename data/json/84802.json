The hotel is located opposite the turn into Celebration, which is a pleasant couple of miles walk. It is really close to Old Town which was only a few minutes walk away and right on the 192 a few miles from the entrance to Disney. So the location is great! The hotel itself was everything we were looking for. Our room was in block 7 on the ground floor facing the pool. We had a lovely new carpet and every room I got a glimpse of in our block seemed to be the same. I should probably mention that we 'upgraded' to a room with a fridge, which was well worth the extra $10 a day. It also had a microwave but we didn't need it. I reckon you've a better chance of a new carpet in the slightly more expensive rooms but that's just my guess. I would ask for one at reception when you check in as the staff were very obliging. The room was large with two double beds and a TV (which wasn't the best quality picture!). The air-conditioning worked well albeit a little noisily. Because it was only April we turned it off at night anyway. The bedding was clean and I saw the housekeeping staff change the outer bedcover when guests had checked out which is always reassuring as I'm not convinced all places do! We had no problems with ants or insects of any kind. The room was cleaned well daily and the towels changed. The hotel has ample parking and consists of blocks of rooms around the pool area. The pool was nice and quite large. There weren't too many sunbeds but it was never busy. There is free wi-fi at the hotel. Initially my iphone only picked it up in reception but for some reason by later in the week I got it at the pool and in my room so don't know whether it was just my phone being difficult! There was breakfast included but we never went as we kept our own things in the fridge. To conclude, I will definitely be going back to the Rodeway. There was nothing not to like and it was so cheap.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roanoke, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNothing fancy but not bad\u201d", "Author": "kaydayAlabama", "ReviewID": "UR127053326", "Content": "If you are looking for immacculate and upscale ...

It also has a free shuttle to and from EPCOT, where you can get on Disney buses or \"trains\" to the other parks. There is a free breakfast which is very basic, but it is fine. The room itself, well, you get what you pay for. The carpet was fraying and dirty looking. In our last room (8111) there were cobwebs all over the walls. In our first room (5 something...) there were tiny ants in the sink. But, you don't go to Kissimmee to hang out in your hotel room, I suppose!

In the morning, Only one person can have a shower because the hot water finishes before the second person goes in. I experienced this problem both days. Ahh the breakfast of course. I must say that it was a joke. There is a separate building for the breakfast. In the morning somebody is waiting next to the door and checks if any guests is taking anyting out to the rooms. Don\u2019t fancy anything better. There are only bananas and bagels. I was there for the seaworld, and It was worth to bear this hotel\u2019s conditions just to see the seaworld during Christmas time. My advice, if you are a couple with no children, go to seaworld. If you are married with children, you can also consider Disney besides seaworld. But please stay away from this hotel.

Check in took about 20-30 minutes per person. Our room key was de-magnetized when we went to the pool so we stood in line for 30 minutes waiting for a new key. I finally had to interrupt one of the clerks (yes, there were 2. Did I mention how slow check in is?) otherwise we would have waited for well over an hour. The carpet was so awful that I didn't feel comfortable going without shoes. We could hear anyone and everyone walking by outside. The hotel told us there was security on property, but we never saw them. The pool is great for older kids and adults because it's 4+ feet deep. Our trip was primarily for Disney, but the transportation was the biggest problem. This hotel offers free shuttles, and these were another big problem. Our return shuttle drivers were always confused about whether or not they should be picking up people for our hotel. They actually forced a group to get on the wrong bus, and they ended up having to take another shuttle from a different location when they discovered the error. They finally returned to the hotel 2 hours later. This hotel is about a 5 minute car ride from the Disney parks and it took our driver 45+ minutes to drive us home. He also was incredibly rude to the family next to us. He had packed so many of us on the bus on one trip that their daughter was sick at one of the stops. As she was vomiting outside at the front of the bus, the driver began laughing at her. When they asked his name he wouldn't give it. He kept telling them that he wouldn't allow them to give a bad report about him. I told them to take his picture and a pic of the bus number before getting off. They did. Our hotel manager was sympathetic but continued to use the same service during our stay. Another driver took us to a hotel that wasn't on the route and hung out there for an additional 10 minutes waiting for someone. Then, this family approached and slipped the driver some twenties and got on the bus. It's all very shady. Breakfast was coffee and wrapped donuts in a dirty hallway. The tub always had chemicals sitting in it every time housekeeping left. A majority of the guests here were trashy and ghetto. We won't be staying there again. I actually am so turned off by the public transportation in Kissimmee that I will only drive a rental car or use Disney transportation in the future.

I got a rate of $19 plus tax, so I wasn't expecting much. Seeing the mixed reviews on here made me think that I should make a backup refundable reservation at another hotel, which I did, but I didn't need to use that and ended up at this hotel. The hotel is located very close to Disney, and has a shuttle service available. I saw many people using that service, so it must be reliable. I was just passing through town, so I didn't use that service. The lobby was immaculately clean. Check in was OK, but I did notice on the statement I signed that I was to be charged a fee of $1.70 for use of a safe. I was able to have that fee removed, since I didn't need the safe; however, I was not able to remove the $2.50 charge for the shuttle. Still, I thought that was reasonable, since I usually pay double that at area Kissimmee hotels. The buildings appear to be at least thirty years old, and have the outdoor walkways which were common in the 80's. The rooms were very clean, but very beaten up. When I arrived in the room, I pulled off the bed sheets and checked for bed bugs, which is something I do routinely when I check into a hotel. I did not see bed bugs, but I saw very old, stained mattresses which were coming apart at the seams. Also, I found large clumps of dirt on top of one of the mattresses, which had been concealed by the bedsheets. Also, the beds were not that comfortable. My wife and I spent the night on the \"cleaner\" set of mattresses. In the morning, I checked out the \"breakfast\", which consisted of prepackaged donettes, a coffee machine (which is not kept out all day), and room temperature grocery store orange and apple drink (not juice). We went elsewhere for breakfast. I found the wifi to be excruciatingly slow. I did not check out the pool, but saw that many families were using it. Overall, given the low rate we paid, we weren't disappointed. If someone is seeking the cheapest possible clean room for Disney, then I would recommend this place.

We had 2 young children 11& 9 and was able to accomodate all 4 of us and had a decent size kitchen. The carpet felt little soggy and the floors in the bathroom and kitchen were dirty.

The good: the pool is great - it's very large, heated, and open long hours. The grounds are very well-maintained. It's very close to all the Disney parks - took us under 10 minutes driving from the hotel to being parked at Disney. There are tons of stores and restaurants very close by. Our room had a microwave and mini-fridge. There were on-site laundry facilities. The staff were all friendly if I was friendly to them - I kept in mind that they're probably getting paid very little to work in this dumpy hotel and deal with unhappy guests all the time. And this place is cheap. The bad: Although friendly, the maid who cleaned our room could not understand spoken or written English, so when I asked for extra blankets and pillows, nothing happened. Many appliances wouldn't stay plugged in because the plugs were old and worn out. Clock didn't work. Mattresses were in sorry shape. \"breakfast\" is a little package of mini-donuts and a cup of juice or coffee. People in the lobby and other places in the area will try to sell you discounted tickets if you do some kind of time-share thing, which of course we didn't do. The ugly: Although it was mostly cleaned, everything was so run down it seemed dirty. Moldy old bathroom - mold under the toilet rim. But the ugliest was the \"free shuttle\" to Disney. It took over an hour to get there, very crowded, and you have no choice but to go back to the hotel at the one time they come and get you - doesn't matter if your children are worn out and crying at 7:00, you're not getting a shuttle back until 9:15. Of course, you know this up front, but you might not realize just how tired and cranky your whole family can be by 7:00 after walking in the sun and waiting in lines for the whole day. Do yourself a favor and just pay the $11 for parking - the Disney park roads are EXCELLENT, all marked well and very organized. You can bring all the stuff you want in your car instead of lugging it onto a crowded bus for an hour and you can leave whenever you feel like it. We took the shuttle the first day, then drove and paid for parking the next four. So this place was pretty run-down and the mattresses were uncomfortable, but it did have it's perks. And really, anybody who expects a lot for $40 a night is fooling themselves anyway.

The check in process went very quickly, the staff was very friendly and I was out in about 7 minutes (good considering 2 guests in front of me).

The beds themselves were comfortable (alittle on the soft side but ok) but the pillows were flat...I used 2 and that worked just fine.

We came down to get the \"free continental breakfast\" about fifteen minutes before the scheduled allowed time would expire and the staff was very nasty about the whole thing and kept hissing that the breakfast station was closed. Not having anything the previous night we grabbed the tiny loaf that they had yet to put away and left to go down the street for breakfast. Also there was no refrigerator in our room at all and when we asked the desk about it they just shrugged thier shoulders and looked away. For internet access may I suggest that you bring your own comuter. There is no computer in the lobby and when you ask the front desk they say, \"We have no internet access, but you can go next door to use thiers.\" (By the way that's a charge of $5 for fifteen minutes next door). The maid did clean the room everyday but I wonder how well as there were dead \"love\" bugs on the wall the entire time we were there. At the end when we were checking out they charged a miscellaneous fee that I asked them to explain as we had prepaid for our stay of 10 days ahead of our arrival. The lady would not tell me and just said as she shrugged, \"It's a miscellaneous charge.\" A $21.00 miscellaneous charge.

Breakfast was not much to chose from: a cake, a cup of orange juice or apple juice and coffee, but we did not expect more for the price we paid. The parking lot seemed secured enough. The front desk people were friendly and polite. The location is close to the parks and there are plenty of restaurants and fast foods to chose from within walking distance. The gas station near the hotel offers good, cheap sandwiches, snacks and drinks. I did not like that the $ 2.50 per day was not disclosed to us before booking the room, that the little shampoo bottles appeared after 4 days in the bathroom. Not very pleased with the shuttle service. It's not flexible when it comes to the departure and return time; on the other hand, the bus stopped in another 4 or 5 places to pick up tourists.

She wasnt informative, perhaps she's tired. What we asked, that's what she explained. Period.She pointed us a direction to our room, which lead us to a locked gate, and made us walked back again to lobby. When we explained about it, she just smiled and open the door behind her without say sorry and hold the door with her feet. Well, what do you expect from a budget hotel. Morning shift : No problem with them. They are okay. They allowed us to keep our backpacks in the room behind them. Room : I didnt expect much, just a place to sleep, because I knew we would be always come home late at night . So, when I did a little bit inspection, I was relieved to find it's clean, the lamps and tv are working, and there's no hair /bugs on my bed nor in the bathtub. They provided clean linens, enough towels for face/body/hand. There's no strange smell, and the water heater works fine. Shuttle : The hotel offers free shuttle from/to hotel- disney park, which is a combined shuttle bus with Howard Johnson guests.(The Howard Johnson hotel is right beside Rodeway Inn) . Dont rely on the shuttle much, because they are not always on time. They have 3 shuttles,in the morning, that goes in different time, from hotel to Magic Kingdom/Epcot, and 3 shuttles from the park , which are 6pm, 9.20pm and 10.30pm. It's said in the information paper, that we always had to check with the driver about the time . So on my first day , there's a young driver, he said we will be picked up from disney on 9.20pm. We were waiting and waiting . And the bus came at 10.30pm! Appearantly there's no 9.20 pm bus! But why were we told differently??? My suggestion is, if you want to use the free shuttle bus, use the first one in the morning from the hotel (7.30am), and use the last one (10.30pm) from magic kingdom back to hotel. The 7.30am bus is quite reliable and on time. We found out that there's a LYNX bus, number 56 that goes to Magic Kingdom. It comes every 15-20 minutes and $1.50 per trip. Just look for the pawn sign , about 10 meters to the left , in front of the hotel. It will just take 15 minutes to Magic Kingdom. If you're heading back to the hotel, you can ask the driver to stop at 'watermania ' . Then, you just walk across the street. Breakfast : Not much. It's a continental breakfast \"eat on the go\". And the meal is always same, muffin in the plastic, juice and coffee. For just a 99 cent , we got ourselves ham sandwich, from the store at gas station beside hotel. Props goes to the cleaning service guys. I left my hand phone when we already checked out , and immediately back to my room when I realized it on the way . The cleaning service people had already start cleaning the room when I was there . I told them I left my phone on the bed, and if they were seeing anything. One girl, went to her cleaning trolley and hand me the plastic bag with my hand phone in it. There's my room number written on it.

The shuttle only goes out in the morning hours, and I came in around 2 in the afternoon. The taxi company the motel sent for was nasty, wouldn't take my credit card after the motel told me they would and charged me $25 for a ride that shouldn't have cost that much even the motel said the same thing. They were going to look into it, but I never heard anything back on it. There are two motels right near the motel an IHop and a Waffle House.

We were vacationing in Orlando, tried to get a last-minute reservation on 3/24/06 at a local hotel and couldn't because they were full (as were almost all hotels we tried due to Spring Break). I called the chain's 1-800 number to try another hotel and the woman suggested the Rodeway Inn. I took it immediately without any further investigation. When we arrived, the room keys did not work and had to walk back to the main lobby to have them reactivated. When we did get into the room we were blown away with a horrible stuffy/stale/moldy smell that we found was coming from the refrigerator that was unplugged (or at least I believe that was the source). We had to open the door to get fresh air in for over an hour. Then, when we turned on the heater, a horrible burning smell came out of it. To my 4-year-old's horror, we found a dead cockroach lying on the floor next to the refrigerator, rust on the floor in the bathroom along with VERY outdated fixtures, floors, etc. THANK GOD we did not have to wash up in the morning and just left to head back home. My husband wouldn't even get out of his clothes and put on his pajamas due to the nasty environment. My daughters and I did and when we walked bare-foot around in the room and then sat on the bed, we found that the bottoms of our feet were DIRTY!! I couldn't believe it!!! We washed them and tested it out again and it was true! The carpet was so terribly filthy that it caused the bottoms of our feet to turn brown!!! We wanted to leave immediately but could not find another hotel at this late time during Spring Break in Orlando! Plus, they informed me that they had already charged my account when I had reserved the room and had not checked in by 4pm. I felt trapped. The beds were hard and thread-barren. I worried all night that someone was going to either break into my room or break into my car. I am a working-class city-girl and not in need of the finest things, but good grief.

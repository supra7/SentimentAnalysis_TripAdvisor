Marina City is less than five minutes walk from Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile.

Complaints; glasses started disappearing after day one we started with six in the room and ended with one. The TV set itself to a high volume every time you turned it on (maybe good if you have gone deaf in the mean time), and I've learnt that it's maybe better to tip the maid a day earlier than you leave (there was a knock at the door at 9.45 the night before we left and again at 8am) if you want a lie in.

I stayed here twice, three nights each, in a month (for work...I had no choice but to return). Both times, I couldn't sleep AT ALL because of the lumpy and saggy beds. I seriously think that budget hotels have better beds. I actually slept on the floor the last night because the beds sucked so much. I'm a 30-year-old with no back problems or aches and pains on a regular basis, but every night and every morning, my back and hips were sore and I woke up many times during the night because I was uncomfortable. I wasn't just my room either. I had two different rooms in my differing stays and both beds were terrible, and two of my colleagues said their beds were also terrible. The center of the bed has some support running down in, so that's ok, but then each side dips down and sags. These beds must literally be 10 years old. I can't even imagine how disgusting they are under the sheets if they're old enough to be this saggy. And, the pillows, while fluffy and soft, also provide absolutely no support. I would never stay at this hotel again, despite the good location. NOT worth bad sleep...if you're sight-seeing you can't really enjoy it if you can't sleep.

I booked it because of a price deal on Travelzoo, its location, and the reviews mostly being positive. The Sax was very pleasant, with fun and interesting decor and helpful pleasant staff. It is a beautiful hotel, really. We had a room on the 15th floor, overlooking the street. The view was great through the floor-to-ceiling windows that could be opened. The bed was really comfortable. The bathroom was quite large and had attractive tilework and fixtures. I asked for two extra pillows and some more towels, and the hotel provided them quickly. The room was clean and smelled nice. The hallways and amenities in the hotel were in good repair. The bathroom was stocked with some very nice lotion, a nice bar soap on the sink, and the shower/bath had squirt bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. I liked the lotion a lot, and the bar soap as well. The shampoo/condition were OK but didn't seem to be of great quality. The use of the refillable pumps was fine for showering, but at one point I decided to have a bath and having to stand up periodically to reach the products was kind of inconvenient and potentially dangerous. The room was comfortable and seemed in good repair mostly. A few minor issues: I had to fix the toilet myself as the flusher handle was not attached to the mechanism and so the toilet wouldn't flush (easy fix and not worth calling down for maintenance, but shouldn't housekeeping have noticed when they were cleaning?). The room came stocked with only 2 bath towels. I had to ask for more towels, which were quickly provided, but next day after the room was cleaned we were back to two towels again. No washcloths provided at all on the first day. I assumed the hotel didn't provide washcloths, but the next day there were some. One other issue was that we could hear the people in the room next to ours. It was an adjoining room, and even normal talking levels could be heard far too well across the rooms. They need to do more soundproofing. I wasn't sure if it was just the adjoining doors that were the problem, or the walls as well. It was nice that on the other side of our room there was a staircase that wasn't much used. The second night we didn't have neighbors, so it was all very quiet. The fee to park the car was a bit higher ($52) than some of the other downtown hotels, but it was valet with in and out privileges. The cars were parked nearby (in the corncobs/Marina City) so getting the car when desired was fairly quick and easy. We did have one strange incident with the car. The morning after our arrival when we went downstairs, we found our car parked in front of the hotel. We hadn't asked for it or anything, and we weren't checking out until the next day. The valet wouldn't tell me why it was there, he just said \"don't worry\" when I asked why it was there. It was handy as we were able to get an item from the car that we had forgotten, but very mysterious! The room was stocked with a minibar tray and a refrigerated minibar. We used neither, but on our checkout, we were billed over $7 for cashews that we did not eat. The hotel desk person removed the charge without a hassle (still, I have seen this on many of the reviews making me wonder if they just throw minibar charges on the bills hoping people won't notice and will just pay it). The Crimson Lounge (bar inside the hotel) was nice, although expensive. The staff/service in the lounge was very attentive. We had the key lime martinis which were amazing! We found the music levels in the lounge pleasant if we went early in the evening. Later in the night it was too loud for us. They were replacing the desk chairs during our stay, so one day we had one chair and the next day we got a new one. The first chair was a bit battered and not very comfortable, but in-keeping with the hotel's funky decor. The second chair was much more comfortable - maybe not quite the funky style, but a nice modern style. We did also have a snakeskin chair that was fun although a bit noisy. The location of the Sax is perfect. It is right on the river and very easy to walk to a million fun places in the city. It is an easy walk to Michigan Ave, Millennium Park, and Navy Pier. There are all kinds of great theaters, bars, restaurants, parks, etc, within an easy walk. You might want a bus or a cab to some destinations that are a little bit further like the aquarium, planetarium, museum of science and industry, etc, but there is a lot within easy reach of your two feet. Loved the location of the Sax, the room, and the funky decor.

Lived in downtown Chicago for 3 years, so needless to say we were excited to be back! Pros: - Great location - next to the \"corn cobs\", House of Blues, downtown and the river - Ambiance - sexy decor, don't know how else to describe it. Take a look at the pics, lots of velvet, deep reds, etc. Actually I think someone described it as a Disney Haunted House vibe. Yes, a sexy Disney Haunted House vibe. - Staff - very friendly staff! I was sick and had some left over Soup Box (fast food soup place, do try the lobster bisque mixed with tomato soup if you're keen) and wanted to heat it up. I called room service and they delivered a microwave, bowl and spoon quickly and without a fee. Cons - View: website says ceiling to floor windows, but doesn't mention the wall dividers in the window (will post pictures) in our room - Small room: we had a room with one huge bed in it - and that's about it. There was a table along the wall at the foot of the bed, a flat screen, 2 chairs and 2 end tables, all squeezed into a small room. - Limited HD channels: we wanted to watch the Niners and Giants game from the privacy of our room and had to watch on a non-HD channel. If you plan to stay in doors and watch TV, call in advance to find out HD channels available. I know not a deal breaker, but it was the NFC championship game! - Mini bar charges! We got charged 1 M&M and 2 Miller Lite beers after the fact ($17). And we did not touch the bar. I called in and we got refunded (still waiting for confirmation) which was easy and fast, but I am wondering if they do that to all their customers, to see what they can get a way with? Conclusion Good for business trips. You're in and you're out. You've got a swanky bar in the lobby, Harry Caray's down the street, House of Blues at your finger tips and Caribou Coffee around the corner.

Quite frankly, the lobby isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fancy or a lobby\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a hallway with Bin 36 on one end and a reception desk that doubles as a place to purchase fine crystal on the other. Is it the super friendly staff? Nope. Reception folks are nice, but about as nice as they are obligated to be. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a huge smile, a hug and a free room upgrade. This group - including valet - is all about efficiency, and they seem to do it well. Perhaps one of the reasons I like the Sax is because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just different than most hotels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the Disney Haunted Mansion vibe going on. When the elevators open, or you key into your room, or visit the Crimson Lounge, you get the sense a fog machine is about to start up and Vincent Price is going to greet you. (As a side note, I swear the eyes on that woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picture in the elevator move.) But none of this is meant in a negative way by any means. Actually, the mix of modern and somewhat darker motifs give this hotel a little character, which in my humble opinion is greatly missing in most cookie-cutter overnighters. As for the rooms, I have always found them to be clean and the late evenings quite. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is trendy and unique. The shower/tub combo is a bit small, but suffices. The phone rings. The stereo, alarm clock and TV are all in good working order. The mini bar good to go. Comfy robes? Check. Beds and pillows are always subjective. You should note that when I hit a bed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m beat, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just glad it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a holding cell. Could the rooms use a little upgrade at some point? Probably, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deter you. Perhaps the Sax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best characteristic is the location. No taxi needed to get to Ten Pin, Public House, Rockit Bar, Paris Club, Hub 51, Keefers, Trump Bar, Harry Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (very under-rated because of the name sake), and a thousand other fun places for great food and drinks. (Skip the cheesy tourist trap known in Chicago as the House of Blues unless you are attending a concert.) I love the location and if pressed could whip out another dozen or so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not to be missed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bars or restaurants without thinking. And, depending upon the event being hosted and the crowd, the environment at the Crimson Lounge in the Sax is a great place to meet people, dance, drink, and ultimately end the night. Guests at the hotel tend to be a little younger (under 40?)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a little wilder looking than what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find at the Embassy Suites down the street. Most are there to have a good time, not just crash for the night. While there are nicer hotel options, cheaper hotel options, and hotel options with more, well options (Spa? Pool? Full menu room service, etc.), in Chicago, the Sax is a unique boutique hotel with an interesting interior and a hard to beat location.

First and foremost, the toilet \"ran\" all the time. Multiple attempts to cease the noise, including lifting the back off of the toilet to investigate the hardware inside, did little to curtail the incessant noise. I also could not connect to the internet because the hard-wire connector was not plugged into the wall, and the connector plate was behind the headboard, which was affixed to the wall, prohibiting access to it. Although wireless was an option, the signal strength was too weak to be effective in the room. Every time I turned on the TV, the volume was extremely LOUD, even though I would turn it off at a much lower volume; attempts to change this apparent default via the TV and the remote were fruitless. Although the \"hotel services\" book listed prices for items in a mini-bar, there was no such item in the room. Since there were no ice machines nor vending machines anywhere to be found, I either had to visit a restaurant or drink water out of the tap for fluids. The walls also were so thin that I felt I was in the middle of the argument between the couple next door at 2:00 in the morning. Finally, the room thermostat seemed to be oblivious to any changes I made, as it was always extremely warm in my room. To be blunt, the location of this hotel is great. It is basically next door to Harry Carey's and across the street from the House of Blues, two venues which I love in Chicago, but I will not stay here as long as it is owned by Thompson.

Contemporary chic meets the 1970s basement rec room. I think because of the style it's less obvious that it's so average.

When I entered my room, there was an envelope on the desk addressed to perhaps a different guest in a different room. No big sea -l when I called down to the desk someone came up to get it right away. Things that make it a mediocre hotel are - lack of coffee machine, lack of towels (I had 2 towels and 2 cloths, and only got the additional 2 hand towels on my second day), and lack of furniture. The bed appears comfortable but is lumpy and squeaky. For some reason the hallways are dark, damp, and over-air conditioned. Add the smell of cologne and I'd feel like I was in a clothing store for teens only. My room was also way too air-conditioned and took a number of hours set at 80 to heat up to just normal room temperature. I grabbed a snack from the honour bar and noticed afterward the best by date of 03/11 (my stay was 08/11). It won't kill me but for $7, a luxury or high end hotel would have been on top of that. Also amusing about the honour bar, I had a different selection in it this morning before I left than the one I had when I got back later in the day. I also feel like this hotel is minimally staffed. I barely ever see anyone, at concierge, front desk or otherwise. It's not that the hotel isn't functioning for lack of staff, just in general, I never really see anyone to just ask a casual question of. Last thing, beware the internet... $15/day is totally nuts.

What it works for you might not work for me. What you find outstanding I might find it random and so on. It really depends on the type of hotels you're used to, your perception on things and how picky you are. I've been to such amazing hotels all over the world with such quality and professionalism by the staff that honesty when I read people think this hotel is \"amazing\" gives me a jaw drop.\u00c2\u00a0First of all, I'm a frequent traveler to the wonderful city of Chicago since is my bf home town. We like to always try different hotels in the city. This time we tried Sax Hotel. We stayed 7 nights in room 1019. Got Studio King Room.\u00c2\u00a0This room offers king bed, sofa bed, two flat tv (one for living room area and one for bed area) desk, snacks & beverages, small closet for such a big room, floor to ceiling windows, good sized bathroom, vanity mirror, hair dryer, two sinks, decent sized tub.\u00c2\u00a0The sleeping quality was ok. But bed was too soft and pillows were almost flat, which don't give full support to your neck. No free internet provided. As an additional detail i want to share, one night my bf complained that he felt a bug bite in his arm. We thought it was a mosquito bite, but the next day I woke up with 5 nasty bites all over. Bedbugs? A Spider? Mosquitoes?? you be the judge. All I know is no so called 4 star hotels should even have mosquitos in their rooms. Other thing that I noticed is they don't really clean well. Saw lots of dust in mirrors and tables. Im a cleaning freak since im allergic to dust, so you can imagine the scene. Can't believe they have stains on the main lobby carpets. An insult to guests in my opinion. Decor in general is pretty random and even starting to look dated. Not sure why\u00c2\u00a0people think is \"beautiful\". Funky old couches, red carpets (a big indicator of old-fashioned hotels) poor lightning, weird painting in elevators and lounge, it almost feels they came out of a Harry Potter movie and the people in the painting will move. Weird front desk glass cabinet, cheap Christmas lights in window. Definitely not a good taste decor. Parking cost is ridiculous! 52 bucks for 24 hrs, are you kidding me? Room service is expensive too. Almost 70 bucks \u00c2\u00a0for a random breakfast for 2. Definitely not worth it. If you add those extra expenses to the room bill you can easily get a nice room in Trump Tower.\u00c2\u00a0However, the good thing about this hotel is the fabulous location. But as I said, you can get a better hotel in the same area for the same price or a little bit more. Hotel 71 or the Wit are good choices. All these little details such as price, service, cleanliness, and decor make a big difference between poor, good and great hotels.\u00c2", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular!!!\u201d", "Author": "ericsf", "ReviewID": "UR116639844", "Content": "Had an absolutely spectacular stay at the Hotel Sax.

The Crimson Lounge was my favorite. I could have hung out there for days but could have gone without the rave-techno music on Saturday night, which, in my opinion did not mesh well with the baroque furnishings and overall antiquarian aura.

We really liked the very trendy decor throughout the hotel and our room (a king studio on the 10th floor at the back of the building) featured high ceilings with a floor-to-celing and wall-to-wall bedroom window. Both the bedroom and bathroom were spacious, modern, comfortable and clean (one thing to note is that our bathroom had an abbreviated bathtub but we didn't mind since we're not bath people). The business centre on the 4th floor is a bit tricky to find due to low lighting, no signage and being tucked away in the cavernous lounge space but we appreciated that it was quiet there and free to hotel guests and we were able to print out our boarding passes the night before. We also appreciated the noon-time check-out and were able to enjoy a leisurely morning before heading to the airport to catch our flight home. The hotel is centrally located to the El, shopping, sightseeing and nightlife, so we were able to walk everywhere and there were plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from. One really good place we went to around the corner was Sullivan's Steakhouse and would highly recommend it for the excellent food and service (and try their signature drink, \"The Knockout\"!). Reservations at all restaurants (those who will take them) are highly recommended as the core is very busy at night. Aside from our own informal Oak Park tour (a beautiful, peaceful suburb), we also took the architectural boat tour and highly recommend both as well but again, advance ticket purchases are a must for both! One shop I would no-holds-barred recommend shopping in in Oak Park (across from the OP visitor's centre) is a camera store called \" Holiday Camera\". We went in to see if I could purchase a memory card for my camera and after checking in the back of the store, the owner, Mike Lebarre, told me they were on order but were not in as yet. He then kindly LENT me, a total stranger, his own camera card and gave me his business card with their address so that I could mail it back to him when I got home to Canada. How amazing is that?!

We overllooked the House of Blues (we were high above their building) and were overlooking the Chicago river and those \"bee hive condo's. The room was clean, fresh, modern, large bathroom (with fantastic bath products), flat screen tv's, and honor bar. The room only lacked a in-room coffee machine (coffee was hard to find unless you were up before 0800-which coffee is served in the lobby 0600-0800) but who is up that early when your on a get-away. The hotel shares the building with Bin 32 (my favorite wine bar in Chicago--Juan the bartender is the best server I have ever had-anywhere). Crimson Bar inside the hotel, is dark adn mysterious and the progressive house music that Jason the DJ played was perfect for the environment. Travlers of all ages were in the house and once again service was top notch. Next time we go to Chicago, we will definately stay at the SAX Hotel. THe location is central to everything Chicago. 10-15 minute walk to Bloomingdales on Michigan Ave. 5-10 minute walk to the loop (Macy's/Marshall Fields/theater district) 10 minute walk to the Mechandise Mart. We travel to Chicago frequently (we live in Michigan) and we will be staying at the SAX again.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queens, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice Location and touches But.....\u201d", "Author": "tmoo6", "ReviewID": "UR106490999", "Content": "I enjoyed the location of the sax hotel.

Certain amenities were free, such as computer access, gym access, and a fridge for my room. 4. Some would consider the decorations attractive, but that's subjective. Now for the bad: 1. The room smelled like old books 2. The bed was very worn out and uncomfortable. 3. The TV doesn't have a lot of channels and it's HD but most of the channels aren't so the picture quality is very bad. 4. The gym is very lackluster. Only three treadmills, three elipticals, one exercise bike, a very poor selection of dumbbells, and a life-style machine that I couldn't get the pin to fit into to adjust the weight plates, so I couldn't use it. 5. The 3 computers they have for internet use are outdated, and you have to be standing to use them. It would be nicer if you can sit, and nicer yet if they would spend 40 dollars to get better mice than the cheap, rollerball ones they use that don't move very well. 6. Worst of all, my room was situated right above where the line forms for the House of Blues. No big deal when people are in line before the show starts because it's early. And even though there was quite a line before the show, it wasn't that bad. But afterward, it was a different story. I'm guessing most of the concert goers were drunk, because they were 100x louder after the show than before. The staff at the House of Blues manages the line before the show, so you would think they would tell people to leave the property after the show, but nope. There were people loitering there for hours. Literally, hours. They know there's a hotel right across the driveway, so if I was the manager, that would never happen. By that point, I was already in bed, and I didn't want to pack everything back up and get dressed to move to another room. You might say that I was stupid for staying here, and if I would have known this was the hotel I'd be staying at, you'd be right. But I arranged my hotel stay through Hotwire only knowing that it was a \"4 star\" hotel and a couple of the amenities. They did not say it was right next to a noisy landmark, otherwise I would have avoided this place like the plague.

We are both in our early 30's, so still want that different/funky vibe in our rooms. We also have a teen who loves video games, so when we seen their tech room we were psyched!! The website shows a beautiful mix of funky and classy, with a wonderful location to downtown-we were sold. We arrive to a cool lobby with beautiful furniture and a friendly front desk lady. The lady told us our parking would be free when we asked when we should pay the $25.00 the site advised it would cost a night. We told her again that the site said we indeed needed to pay, though we would love it to be free-we could not hustle the nice lady. She insisted on her computer it said our parking was indeed free, it was comp by the manager-SWEET!!! We get to our room and it was FILTHY and cheap looking. The chair had a big rip in it, the garbage had some kind of liquid in it, but gross of all-our bed had CRUST on the sheets and blankets. Now to be fair, it looked like sauce from food, but it was every where on both beds. When I dropped my key in disgust and went to pick it up, there was looked like short dog hair in the carpet with a million crumbs. I called the front desk right away and asked for another room, the man who helped me on the phone was very blah to me and about it, but I think that was just his voice. He was quick to get someone up to help us carry our bags to another room, which I was happy about. The man that came was the bell boy we had seen when checked in and was nice when we arrived, but when we opened the door he started questioning us on the rooms state-like he did not trust us. He kept giving us strange looks while standing in the room as we gathered our things, till I snapped(sorry to say-I still feel bad) and told him if he had a problem with what we're saying to look around himself instead of standing in the door way pretty much calling us liars. He said he was sorry and grabbed ONE BAG and took us to another room. It was the exact same style room, so it made me even more mad we were being treated like liars, he made it seem we were just trying to get an upgrade..lol. This room was much more clean, though still run down and cheap seeming-I'll take cheap over dirty any day. Well, we woke up early to find a bill under our door for the damn parking!!! I took it as they were upset to have to change our rooms and decided to charge us anyway. So, I called down and spoke to the same blah/nice front desk man, who told me it does say free in the system, but will talk to the manager. He called back and was very sorry to tell us it was a mistake and we did owe the 25.00-even though we tried to pay it when we first got in. Fine, we had a taping to go to and had to run-so I asked him if we could get the tech room open for our soon while we were gone. We were told the night before the tech room was only open from 4:30 till midnight(something close to those hours), but we could request someone open it up prev to those hours. Well, we got in @ 7pm and it was closed-he said due to cleaning and that's why tomorrow they would open it for our son and any other guest to enjoy before we checked out. Well, when I asked in the morning, they said their was no way they could open it up till 4:30 today and the front desk & bell staff was mistaken. We were livid again, but in a rush. We asked if we can at least get a later check out and they said the latest they could do was 1pm-fine. I travel a lot and love staying at hotels-staying at a good hotel makes me feel like I'm living a different life. This place had me longing for my son's dirty room and the yelling to clean it up..lol. The price was OK, but at anything over $120.00 a night, I would expect a clean room and keep what they have on their site open as promised. Again, I stay at a lot of hotels and in the last 8 years, this was the worse place I have ever stayed at. Other people may have had better luck, maybe it was just my room, that night front desk, bell stand, my luck in general-I will never stay here again nor will I recommend this place to any of my co-workers or human in general. P.S. I am not being bitter-I've never wrote a negative review-ever. If it was just bad service or a closed tech room-fine.

The hotel was clean and we stayed on the 15th floor out of 16 :) Our room was clean and the beds were so comfortable. The fitness center was nice but we opted to run on Michigan Avenue Christmas morning. Most of everything was closed and barely any foot traffic so we took advantage of that. We found plenty to do here during our stay from the German open market at the Daily Plaza to Navy Pier. Walking around downtown Chicago on Christmas Eve looking decorations while it was snowing was the best. We had a great dinner at Sullivans on Dearborn. Sleeping in Christmas Day was the best! The hotel was quiet and the staff was friendly. We both would stay thier again!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cChristmas visit w/ the family was GREAT!\u201d", "Author": "shytown", "ReviewID": "UR90313207", "Content": "Took my wife and two young children (1 & 4) up to Chicago to see the big-city during the Holidays. We put in a bid for $100 on a 4 star hotel along Michigan/River North and were lucky to have the Sax take our bid. The location was great for us as it's centrally located - easy access to both the loop and Michigan Ave. We took the short walk across the river and visited both the old Marshall Fields building (now Macy's) and saw their window displays and visited the Kristkindlmarket. All the previous posts that rave about the Hotel's staff are right on the money. From the bellhops, to valet (we actually parked the car up in Lincoln Park and took the Brown Line back, saving the Hotel's $50 parking fee), to the front-desk staff, they were all wonderfully polite and courteous, all eager to accommodate our needs. Although Priceline booked us into a room with one queen bed, we paid the extra $20 a night for two double beds and a lot more living space. We thought the extra space was well worth the extra charge. The room was very spacious and clean, with a full wet-bar, bath robes, and flat panel television. The room did have an art-deco style theme, but I thought it was very classy and well done. Beautiful long drapes hung across the windows, which we used to encircle our child's pack-n-play creating a nice tent-like effect. The only downside to the hotel was the lack of a traditional lounge area - but with two kids and so much to do and see in the city, this was the least of our concerns.

Both the room and bed were comfortable. It was quiet. I never heard anyone walking and/or talking in the hallway like you do at some hotels or the usual door slams.

Housekeeping did a great job every day. Everyone was polite. Cons: No coffee maker :-( My husband would run to the restaurant next door every morning to buy two cups of coffee. The toilet usually needed two flushes--it seemed to work well every other flush. Internet cost $10/day. We were charged for Swedish fish (yuck) and there was an extra open container that appeared the second day we were there although neither one of us even touched any of those containers. They did quickly removed the charge though. Didn't appreciate the last morning when we went to eat breakfast at the attached restaurant next door. For some reason the door had a sign that said to use the main (outside) entrance. We went to the first set of doors to go outside only to find they were locked. We went all the way back to our rooms to get our coats before heaing outdoors--in the snowstorm--to walk to the restaurant entrance. Once inside we observed many people going in and out of the door with the sign saying not to! Guess we shouldn't have been rule-followers. The cons were all minor though and we really did have a great and comfortable stay and we would definitely come here again.

It was easy to get to the museums, to the Shedd, and to the couple of business meetings I had on Michigan Ave. I got in late at night via taxi (so I can't comment on parking), and I was initially worried because there's a lively, crowded (good people-watching!) club downstairs. No worries, I didn't hear a thing when I wanted to get to sleep. The hotel really is geared, some might say, \"young,\" but I just think it's hip and in step with the times and a nice break from big chains.

For example, there's a cool media room you can book for free where you can play xbox and wii and hang out. So I'll say it's definitely a new 'hotel experience' for me, but a good one! The room was comfortable and reasonably sized and tidy. I was in a non-smoking room but strangely there was what looked like a cigarette burn in one of the end tables. The hallways maybe are a little more dark and slightly dank than I'd like andI think the ventilation in the room wasn't as good as I would have liked, either, but overall ok there. It does seem like I have to note how hip and chic the style of the hotel and room is, and I really liked it, but really it has to be comfortable and serviceable or else it just fails as a hotel, and Hotel Sax was comfortable and had good check-in service (even if they had to shout over the music downstairs late at night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was totally quiet during the day).

And while the lobby and Crimson Lounge areas are very unique with many sexy design elements, the actual hotel rooms are terrible. You'd think a hotel that is so invested in their reputation as a design showplace would go to the trouble of keeping up the appearence of the property...but you'd be wrong.

The electrical outlet dock on the nightstand was not only broken (so the only working outlet was in the bathroom...which is where I had to plug in my computer) it was caked with what can only be described as \"gunk\". There was mildew between the tile in the bathroom. The entire room was covered in dust. There were cigarette burn marks on the curtains and holes in the sheets. Oh, and to top it all off, when I went to use the lotion in the bathroom after my shower I discovered that it was only 1/3 full. Yes, it was used. When I checked in at 5pm, there were dirty dishes in the hallway left over from someone's room service. At 6:30 when I left the room to explore the rest of the hotel, the dishes were still there. When I came back to the room to get ready to go out for the evening at 7:30 the dishes were STILL in the hallway...and there was a roomservice maid with her cart cleaning one of the rooms.

The shower was also small, but in the end, I didn't mind the size. OK, now the problem. The beds are horrible. They feel fine at first, but after a night of sleep, I was aching in the morning. Hotel Sax management, you have got to replace the beds.

First off, make sure you have an extra $200 lying around, because they take it out of your card as soon as you check in. They'll give it all back when you check out, so long as you don't touch anything. The snacks on the table are all horribly over-priced, and they are SENSORED. So you will get charged if you pick them up for too long. There is also a $25 fee for removing said items if you would prefer to get rid of the possibility of accidentally doing anything to them. Wireless internet is $10 a day, but you can use the computers in the Studio for free. If you need a microwave, call in for it in advance, or you probably won't get it. There is also no mini-fridge. You might be able to use the private mini-bar, probably for a fee. If you need silverware, bring it with you. You will get charged for room service to bring you anything, even silverware. Parking is $55 a night. There are no inputs on ANY of the TVs. If you want to play video games or watch your own movies, you have to use the Studio. The Studio is on the sixth floor; it is a video game room that is the only free and complimentary thing in the entire hotel. It's supposed to open at 4 PM, but each of the three nights of my stay we had to call in to make them open it. I was scared to use the soap at this hotel for fear there would be a charge, so I can't confirm if the stuff in the bathroom was complimentary or not. Didn't want to chance it. Putting all of the absolutely ridiculous charges aside, the room was nice. The beds were really comfortable, though the mattress pad often came off and had to be readjusted. The decor was interesting and different, the large shower head was nice, etc. My friends and I had two double-bed rooms that were totally different. My room was very small and had a tiny pedestal sink in the bathroom, while their room had an extra chair, almost double the floor space, and a large marble sink in the bathroom.

Admittedly, I started my bidding at a low $100 but have done this several times with success in the past when booking the same day as a stay. I had never heard of the Sax before but realized that it's taken the place of the House of Blues so I knew the location and was anxious to explore. Upon check in I requested that we be given a room with two beds or a pullout couch (sharing the room with a friend and her daughter) and was told that there would be a $40 \"upgrade\" charge to do so. When did two beds instead of one king become an upgrade? I got the sense that no matter what I'd requested would include an upgrade charge. So be it. The room was spacious and the shower had a fabulous large head with great pressure. The linens were soft and clean, which is expected at a 4-5 star, but the beds were very limp and both had deep sinkholes in the middle. After a long day of photoshooting for my friend's daughter, we returned to the room at 8-ish starving but too tired to go out so we ordered soup and salads from room service. What a mistake! With so many great restaurants around this hotel we choked down stale bread, a poor excuse for a salad and \"homemade\" soup that tasted like it came out of the river nearby. This was the worst food I've eaten since dorm food! 3 small salads and one bowl of awful soup for $65! But wait, there's more! When we parked my car at the front of the hotel (only parking available at this hotel) we were given a ticket as per usual. The next morning we came down to depart the hotel, gave the bellman our ticket and after a long wait, discovered that they'd misplaced my car. Actually, what happened is the attendant the night before had given me the wrong stub and it didn't match my car ticket. So...after a 20 minute wait my car was pulled out front and we were charged...ready for this??...$55 for one night of parking at a hotel where we had stayed! I almost fainted!

There was absolutely nothing glamourous about the room, which begged the question of why it is rated as a 4 star hotel. The mattresses were lumpy, there is no pool and the internet is not free! The breakfast was meagre and expensive. We only ordered room service once and ate out throughout our one week stay. Also the rooms are not cleaned thoroughly by the housekeeping.

The decor was a little different that I am used to in a hotel but it did not impact our stay. As soon as we started to our room I did notice that the hallways seemed dark. Again, nothing against the hotel just different that I'm used to. The room was clean and a nice size. I did feel like the room was decorated back in the 70s though.

After falling asleep I woke up somewhere around 12:30am and got up and closed the windows and turned the AC back on (I had enough of the sirens, honking horns, and city noise). Around 3:30am or so my wife got up and turned the AC back off again because the room smelled of cigarette smoke. Once again we opened the windows to the city's serenade. I didn't sleep well the next 3 hours. What capped it was at 7am I woke up to the sound of someone (must have been a porter somewhere) blowing a whistle over and over.

Great restaurant BIN 36 attached to the hotel, $100 for breakfast for four girls, but amazing ricotta-blueberry pancakes and pomegranate mimosas in the morning, and also a bright, clean interior. Honestly the best part about this hotel is the bellmen who work at the front door. Nice guys with excellent personalities, found us cabs in less than a minute and were so helpful with directions, suggestions. Chicagoans are very proud of their city and it shows. The Crimson Lounge (attached to hotel, and then see below) for a pre-game drink is a cool place to have a few before deciding where to head out for the night. Sarah, one of the waitresses was really amazing, went through a city nightlife book and recommended a few bars she'd go to her self, and went way out of her way to help us plan our nights out. Housecleaning staff friendly and efficient. CONS: The front desk receptionists are a little robot-y but get the job done. The front desk is like Grandma's Dining Room, crystal glasses on display. I don't know what they are going for here. The Crimson Lounge... ok until 10PM, then it becomes a cheesy, possibly tranny nightclub. I mean, we had to hightail outta there, after a few of the regulars dropped by for the silicone parade of hooker wear. This is all mixed with a few lost and confused tourists wearing fanny packs, jean skirts and white keds who also stopped by for a drink to experience \"the city.\" The rooms... where do I start... black shag carpeting, one mirror and NO ELECTRICAL OUTLETS in the BATHROOM? WTF. We did our hair/makeup sitting on the floor in front of a wall mirror. The mattresses are from 1980 with the original stainings. Pillows are like laying on a tissue. The television sometimes worked. Pretty small rooms with pretty old linens and bare bones hotel soap. Major construction going on here so don't look for ambiance at the door. CHICAGO: We're East Coasters. That said, people are slow as $hit in the Mid-West. I literally felt myself pushing them down the street to walk faster. But all in all, super friendly (a little scary for Bostonians) and the city's architecture is breathtaking. Take a river boat cruise (no gasp of fresh sea air here on a lake though). Cabs are unbelievably cheap. There are some gorgeous hotels with nice bars to hit up at night, as downtown Chicago can be a little cheesy. Shopping is excellent. Didn't try the L, but it's NYC like planning makes this an easy city to walk. Speak with someone who lives there because some of the boroughs are like night and day, safety wise. Take a 12$ cab ride out to Wicker Park for some less intense club/bar scenes for casual relaxed places to grab a drink.

Our upgraded room was nice size, the bathroom was large (huge actually) and it was pretty clean. The kingsized bed was very comfortable (not the pilliows). Con's: Our first room was smaller than our guest bedroom at home. The queensize bed took up the entire room. The bathroom light was a heat lamp that glowed red - no other light in the bathroom. Directly over the bed plaster was falling from the ceiling from an old leak. The upgraded room had floor to ceiling mirrors, wood paneling and a faux alligator skin wing back chair - icky.

We went to the lounge every night and were not disappointed. Despite the large crowd that comes here late night, we managed to get great service and were treated well.

When in Chicago, I usually stay at the Westin Water Tower but as I was traveling to Chicago to attend a concert at the House of Blues, I decided to stay at the Hotel Sax as it is next door to the HOB and I had read the review that the band members often stay there. As a 20th birthday present to my youngest daughter, I bought tickets to see Dashboard Confessional on April 6th at the House of Blues. I booked our room the Saturday beforehand on Expedia.com and received a very favorable rate that included valet parking - a BIG plus for downtown Chicago! Upon our arrival at the hotel, we found that their computer system was down and they were unable to check us in electronically. Absolutely not a problem for them though, as the very gracious front desk manager took our confirmation letter, jotted down my Amex info for incidentials and had the very helpful bellman, Constantine, show us to our room. The room was very sleek and modern. We had paid for a deluxe king but were upgraded to the next class with two doubles. The room was immaculate and the beds were very plush. Constantine offered us tips on the concert venue next door and wished us a pleasant stay. My daughter settled in and then went to the House of Blues to scope out the lay of the land over there. Their staff was extremely helpful and even offered the info that the band would be doing their soundcheck at 2:30 p.m. At that time, the frontman for the band, Chris Carrabba, came in and took some pictures with my daughter and a few other fans who were milling about there. Truly the highlight of her trip! We had to leave the hotel at 4:45 a.m. on the 7th so I could drop my daughter off at Midway for her flight back to her college. We called the bellstand at 4:30 a.m. and when we arrived in the lobby ten minutes later, our car was out front and ready to go. We did not eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food but what we saw looked nice. Quick recap - gracious staff, over the top helpfulness; immaculate, well-appointed room; terrific shower and very quiet for downtown Chicago.

It appeared nice and had a reasonable rate to match. The ammenities seemed sufficient and included parking. Upon checking into the hotel, I was informed that I would be charged an additional $49 for parking service. I then had to spend 40 minutes on the phone talking the individual through how I came to find this and helping him view the list of ammenities (which included parking). He realized the mistake and stated that he would credit my account, but that it could take up to 72 hours. The room was nice enough so I had hoped for a pleasant stay from there on out. I was sadly disappointed. The next morning, I heard the housekeeping staff using profanities loudly out in the hallway. I, personally, wouldn't say that I was offended by such behavior, but did have concern for other guests who might have children staying with them. My spouce and I then left for breakfast, came back to retrieve our things, and checked out of the hotel. After waiting approximately 30 mintues for my vehicle to be returned to me, I realized that I had forgotten my cell phone charger in the room. A front desk attendant then escorted me back to the room where I retrieved the charger and left. A couple of days later, I checked my credit card statement to ensure that the parking charge was in fact credited back to my account only to see that it had been, but an additional $200.00 charge was placed by Hotel Sax onto it. I proceeded to call the hotel numerous times and spoke with a very rude woman who answered the phones. I finally was able to speak with a manager and found out that the front desk attendent, who had escorted me to my room, reported that the room smelled of smoke. My spouse or myself DO NOT smoke and we DID NOT smoke in that room. They admitted to not finding any physical evidence of smoking other than saying it smelled like someone could have been smoking in the room. They refused to credit my account and now I am filing a dispute with my credit card company. The irony of the situation was that the attendant NEVER mentioned any concern with me nor was I notified in any way stating that this extra charge would be placed. This hotel is scamming its customers and I am sure that I was not the first to have had this happen, nor will be the last if something does not occur to stop their ability to place random charges on people's credit cards. I am outraged by this situation and truly feel as though I am a victim of a fraudulent crime. Be AWARE of your credit card statement if you decide to stay at this hotel.

Since the hotel is so close to these things, there is a younger crowd (20s-30s) and not a lot of children (something to keep in mind if you need a place for your kiddies to play).

My criticism comes in their execution of the details. We happened to pick up a bottle of wine that was sitting on the mini-bar tray in our room, and just touching created an automatic charge to our room. Since we didn't actually drink the wine, the over-the-top security system for the mini-bar required us to make some calls to straighten out the charges, which was a bit annoying. The bathroom in the room was clean, but the towels smelled really gross (like sour milk) and the in-room soap and shampoo were nothing special.

When we told him that we did not reserve a king, he rudely responded that the room is what we booked. We clearly disagreed and let him know we had zero use for a king size bed and to please get us the room we requested and booked. It turns out this character was the night manager and he had zero response. After some poking, he offered a roll away bed. After more questioning on how he was going to accommodate us for their mistake, he basically gave us a rude response and tough luck attitude.

We liked the area so decided to book a King room at the recently renovated Hotel Sax. We requested early check-in & got a room right away. We were told that only a Queen room was available. When we got to the room on the 6th floor we were extremely disappointed...the bathroom was so tiny that the sink was in the bedroom area & that area was also very small. I called the desk to complain & the receptionist said \"you booked through Expedia\" then said she could give us a room with 2 double beds...I immediately said yes since we wanted out of that tiny room. The 2nd room was much bigger & had a nice flat-screen TV. I had requested a fridge & asked if there was a coffee maker in the room & was told no, but they would send one up. She also mentioned a microwave & I asked what the charges would be. She said there was no charge & sent the items up. There were floor to ceiling windows that opened. The view was of the unique condo/parking towers & The House of Blues which is very busy every night of the week, but being on the 11th floor the noise was minimal. They provide in-room safe, iron/board, bathrobes, mini bar, nice toiletries & power rain shower that feels like a massage.

I have mixed opinions about the hotel. While we were kind of neutral about our experience (and wouldn't stay there again), I can understand why others would love it. The hotel is very trendy and chic. We stayed in the deluxe king room. The goods: The bed and pillows are super comfortable. Prob the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in a hotel. The staff was very friendly. Both check in and check out was seamless. The rooms were really clean. The hotel has a really cool & young atmosphere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a great location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a block away from the downtown nightlife, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning on a trip to the house of blues, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty much in the same parking lot. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little further from Navy Pier and such than other hotels are, but it is walkable (we walked it) and/or taxis are cheap. Great flat screen tv. The negatives: The rooms were small and dark compared to what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in before. There was zero counter space (or hair dryer) in the bathroom. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcatmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really our style. It kind of has the atmosphere of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcparty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hotel in that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty well rounded bar in the room, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStudio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - which is like a high tech game room, Crimson Lounge is downstairs (a very popular club), the House of Blues is across the street, etc. There was nothing wrong with this, but, for example -it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a place I would ask my parents to stay. Our telephone wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working and the a/c started clicking really bad for awhile. They missed our wakeup call but called and apologized. The walls are a little thin and we could sometimes hear the tv in the room next to us. Besides the hotel, cool things to do in Chicago: of course go to navy pier and stay for the fireworks. Take one of the boat tours. We took the sail boat one. Looking back, probably would have done the more traditional ones. The zoo is only so-so but good for kids. Look for the hot tix location to get discounted theatre tickets. The staff pretty much know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showing at every theatre in town. We saw \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAlice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the looking glass theatre. It was fantastic and great for kids and adults. The green mill was a really cool jazz bar with a lot of history (I guess it was Al Capone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old hub). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there if you want to drink and party though. They ask people not to speak while people are playing. Wrigley field was AWESOME. Andy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jazz Club was tons of fun and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other bars in its proximity (that was our one night of staying up too late and drinking too much).

Though we have stayed at many hotels downtown, Hotel Sax is by far our favorite. First and foremost, the location within the city is ideal. Located on N Dearborn, it is walking distance from Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, etc. House of Blues is Hotel Sax Chicago's neighbor, so time your stay according to their schedule and you'll only have to walk across the parking lot. Located inside Hotel Sax is Bin36- a FABULOUS wine cafe with great wine, cheese flights, and other fare that can be paired with the perfect wine to suit your taste. Crimson Lounge is a new chicago nighttime hotspot that even has it's own \"signature scent\". Well known Dj's frequent here and other musical guests perform. There drink list is out of this world and though we didn't have time to order from the menu- it sounds to die for. Another location inside of adjacent to Hotel Sax is 10pin Bowling Lounge. Think martini's and fingerfoods instead of beer and pizza (though they have that too). OUR ROOM. Room#1119. Amazing. We didn't want to leave! 2 flat panel TV's mounted to the wall that consists of varying patterns- very modern eclectic. The sitting area was large enough to accomodate a small get together, though it was only my husband and I... A spacious desk with free WIFI and informative city guides and the best room service menu I've ever seen! The back wall was made up of a window that , when opened, provided a view of the city. Breathtaking. The bathroom was incredible! Large enough for a family, spacious enough for the two of us. A double vanity with products specially made for Hotel Sax. A stand up shower.. again, big enough for 2..with ideal water pressure. There was also a large tub with jets, oversized towels and perfect water temperature. My stylish husband even said that he would like to make our bathroom at home look like it with the beautiful vanity with black marble top , the black and white tiled floor, the textured wallpaper, and the beautiful curtains (can we include the view of the Chicago too?) PARKING. Close, accessible, easy....pricy. $43/night. Parking anywhere in Chicago is not cheap. Usually we park a few blocks away, but your car is usually not accessible 24/7... and who wants to drag their luggage through the city? We used the valet for parking and paid the $43/night to park and just griped to each other about it, lol. We liked knowing our car was right there and that we could get to it whenever we needed it. What can you do? It's Chicago. Complaints? Not really.. Location: Perfect. Room: Perfect. Staff: Perfect. Style: Perfect. Ammenities: Perfect (what happened to Crunch Fitness Center though???- I didn't get a workout in during our stay:( ) If I had to muster up ONE complaint.. it might be the pillows. Not the best, but my husband sells mattresses and pillows- so I may be a little spoiled. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were a little flat- but if that is the only complaint, then all in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Hotel Sax Chicago.

The Bad half: I had arrived early and let them know I was there, check in was 3:00 and so I joined my party who had their rooms. I waited until 3:40 to go up to the front desk and was told my room was not ready and they would call housekeeping to get an update. In the meantime, she started to handle another guest while I stood there so I sat down on their couches and at 4:00 was motioned up to the desk. Now it was ready, they apologized and asked IF I would like a complimentary breakfast. I was still in a good mood, said it wasn't a big deal and said that's okay, turning it down. As I walked away I thought why didn't they just give it to me, why do they ask me if I want a freebeie? What they are doing is telling me they don't want to give away anything unless I am cheap enough to accept. It's just never happened to me like that and I thought it was odd. A couple hours after claiming my room I was in a state of undress and hear a knock. While I was grasping for clothes and before I could even say just a minute, the door opens and it is a hotel employee not knowing the room was taken (obviously). He got halfway in the room (I am female) and could hardly speak English enough to apologize and quickly shut the door. I didn't report it because I thought no harm done, it was a mistake and made sure I had the chain on for the rest of my stay. One morning for breakfast I joined a party of three at a table who had just ordered their breakfast. Knowing that, I didn't ask for a menu, I just asked for a cup of coffee. Twice. In the meantime, he brought them their food, etc, and never got coffee for me. It was like he was ignoring me because I came late and wasn't expected. So don't expect any special consideration from servers here , they have a high expectation of protocol. The cream on this crappy weekend came when I got home and for a whole week had $400 taken off my credit card as a \"hold\", meaning that amount was taken away from my purchase ability. I called the hotel and it was their room hold for incidentals. I had checked out on a Sunday yet by Thursday it was still on. They said it is up to the bank to release it. I don't know if that was a story or not, my company paid for the room, so that $400 was for my snack bar and movies? I didn't use any of extras and I checked out on Sunday, so I don't know why the hold took so long to clear. I didn't call my bank to verify who really is responsible, but I am in my 40's, stayed in rooms around the U.S. and Italy and this has never happened. It is like this hotel is too good for their own clientele and doesn't trust them . If you a good person, go with the flow, and not demanding or a diva, you may get taken advantage of like I felt I was. I probably should have done more to make a stink about all these issues as they happened, people can't take advantage of you unless you let them. However, I am of the Show-me attitude, and if you don't, I won't come back and will tell everyone I know how crappy I was treated. We are as dangerous as demanding customers.

When the bellboy was helping unload the luggage he told my husband there was a parking ramp 1.5 blocks away for $26 per night (the ramp next to CVS on Kinzie) First we were sent to a room on the 12th floor that was a king size bed and there were 5 of us and I had confirmed the day before that we would have a nonsmoking 2 double bed room. After I contacted the front desk we got switched to a room with 2 double beds on the 11th floor that I was certain the minute I walked in was a smoking room but felt after looking around and not noting any ashtrays that maybe I was mistaken. We also had a room with a door that connected to another room which usually is never an issue but for some reason this hotel or maybe it was this door was paper thin and you could hear the family next door just having casual conversation, a hairdryer being used, the tv show they were watching and I'm sure they were just as impressed with our children settling in to a new environment. We did not stay in the room for long I truly could not stand the smell and did note that the hotel was smoke free throughout but that must be a recent thing.... the first room did not smell that they took us too but the second one was saturated in that stale smoke smell. There is no pool at this hotel, the hairdryer I could not locate until the end of my stay because they keep it in the closet in the room and not in the bathroom where one might expect to find it. The room decor was not my taste at all a bit tacky with the shadow of a chandelier on the wallpapered walls and vinyl throw pillows on the bed along with that vinyl like bucket style chair at the desk with some odd 60's like handle in the middle of the back. The wall to floor windows are nice but made me very nervous when my young child figured out that the smaller panes opened up and there is no screening and you on on the 11th floor. The plasma big screen is nice and the bathroom I thought was one of the better features - it was roomy and not tacky and seemed very clean. The staff was for the most part friendly - although since my husband was leaving to park the car and the bellman that was taking out our luggage and placing it on the cart was assumed to be the person to take the luggage upstairs my husband tipped the guy since he wouldn't be up there.... the bellman walked us in to the lobby acted like he was going to be right behind us by telling us to go up in the first elevator and that he would be in the next, and to our surprise a new bellman showed up with the luggage...... hope the second guy figured out that his tip was sitting in the hands of his buddy that passed us off before completing the task. The only other off experience was the man who was staffing the microsoft room (which my husband and kids enjoyed the xbox 360's) who was \"arrogant\" and very rude according to my husband.... seems other guest were getting the same impression of him from the comments my husband was hearing while in the room. People who have commented on the dark hallways and elevators are right on.... and some of the artwork on the elevator walls is a bit creepy.... a women holding a skull? I admit we are not Blues fans and maybe that is what you need to be into to really appreciate the Elvira/Adams Family decor. The location was different and I did appreciate being at the South end of the Michigan Ave area after coming from the North end - It was fairly close to Millenium Park. The house of blues is literally right outside the hotel door but we did not go to but there was plenty of activity that involved several police cars the night we were there. So after being at that 3 star hotel that was clean, fresh with 2 pools right off N. Michigan Avenue for less money we were very disappointed with what a 4 star offers - if this had been a 2 star I would have gotten exactly what I would have expected and would have felt treated to the bellboys being on staff.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGood Overall.

The lobby is small but really unique using old store display counters filled with antique cut glass items as their check in desk. A big jar of cinnamon jelly beans was a hit. The decor here and in the rooms is just plain out-of-this-world! It looks like some really hip design team had a great concept that they carried out to the finest detail. The staff at every point was fantastic. We got great advice from the concierge, the valets were very funny and personable, the front desk was warm and friendly and I even ran into the general manager on the elevator and he was so nice. An extremely hip place like this tends to have really stuck-up staff (think The Delano in South Beach, Miami) but these people were typical Midwesterners - nice, funny, unassuming. We had two double beds in our room and the sheets and pillows were luxurious. The shower head is enormous and blasted water which we liked. The bar in The Hotel Sax has got to be seen even if you don't stop in for a drink. It has separate nooks with huge couches and chairs. It looked like THE place to meet up if you're a Chicago yuppy. We had a late dinner at Smith and Wallensky's literally a stone's throw across the driveway. The view of the river on a beautiful warm summer's night was great.

The doormen were extremely friendly. The front desk staff were friendly as well, although some of them were a bit hit and miss. The Crimson Lounge is definitely a pro for this hotel. The lounge seems very new, and is decorated in red and black. The drinks are a bit pricey, but the bartenders were extremely sweet and made sure we got fantastic drinks for our dollars. Only downside was that the lounge closed around 1:30am, but this is the same as most places in Chicago. The room was great. Luxurious, comfy beds, huge bathroom, the wireless internet worked flawlessly, and it was spotless every day. The big downside - the concierge. They had a few different people staffing the concierge desk and we only had one competant one - that was Christina or Catherine. She was fantastic, but the others didn't really know anything. They had to make several phone calls to find anything out and they didn't even know the way to get places!

The location was excellent, just a short walk to the Miracle Mile and Merchant Mart. My husband and I were contemplating extending our stay at the hotel because it was so comfortable and, well, perfect. That is, until we retrieved our car from the valet lot a day after we checked in. Our car had been ransacked, with every compartmented rumaged through and our belongings scattered. Luckily, we removed all valuable items from the car except for some quarters intended for parking (those were stolen) but it felt violating to have our car vandalized like that. When we complained to hotel management, they immediately said that they do not run the valet parking service and they just send guests to the lot since it's right across the way. And, of course, the parking service didn't want to take responsibility either. My perception of valet parking is that the car is kept in a safe place where it wouldn't be ransacked so obviously, this kind of service was unacceptable to me. I was tired of getting the runaround so I asked that we not be chared for parking that first night (I parked on the street after that) and they did remove the charge.

On arrival we were very impressed with the lobby area, all be it small, it was bright and airy with crystal and glass in cabinets all around. The doormen were very attentive too. It was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared. The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the 14th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor. This hotel must have just been renovated because everything was immaculate. Our room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow. All the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. We did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin36 for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed. There is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around 20 - 25, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really. We did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. Harry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. ALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience.

No internet... the 2 wired jacks didn't work and the wireless wouldn't hold a connection for more than 30 seconds.

The (probably once comfortable) arm chair in the room has been recovered in... I kid you not... imitation vinyl TEXTURED snake skin. Not only does it look horrid the chair is now cold, uncomfortable and squeaks when you sit in it. I used it once for about 30 seconds. No screens on the windows. To the delight of the fly that joined me in my room on day 2. No vending machines in the entire hotel. None, zippo. The guest book says there are but the hotel operator informed me that there aren't after I went looking. I refused to open the $7 bottle of water in my room and wandered off to a grocery store instead. And lastly, who puts a pedestal sink in a hotel room? There is no counter space to put down all the toiletries you typically travel with and I ended up using the toilet tank as a shelf.

The rooms themselves seemed like the product of a rushed \"Trading Spaces\" or \"While You Were Out\" show in which massive changes were made in a short amount of time for a small amount of money. Gaudy decor aside, the bellman and valet while friendly were inappropriately casual (\"Thanks, man\" and \"Thanks, dude\" were some of their responses to us) and the cleaning staff missed broken glass in front of our room from a dropped tray of a neighboring room. Our room, while large (it was a suite) bordered the elevators and the noise from their movement was nonstop. The lobby is full of cases of crystal stemware.

It is a half block from the Chicago River and many rooms have partial river views (mine did.) It is just a couple blocks from the Magnificent Mile, a couple blocks from the Merchandise Mart, and is surrounded by many of the best restaurants in the city. You can walk to most of the places you'd want to visit. The recently renovated hotel has modern and luxurious furnishings and my room was huge and very comfortable. Great bed, large bath, a huge plasma TV, and windows that actually opened to let in fresh air. Internet in the room was free as was wifi in the lobby. I loved the fact that on each floor by the elevators there was a TV in the wall to watch while waiting for the elevator. The lobby was lovely including the reception desks which were fronted by glass cabinetry filled with beautiful crystal pieces. The front desk personnel were friendly and efficient and the concierge was most helpful. Same for the bellmen. My only staff hitch was the reservations agent I spoke with on the phone who was not friendly or very helpful. When I complained about her in the survey I received after leaving the hotel, the manager was very prompt in writing to apologize about that and promised to remedy the situation. The lobby bar, The Crimson Bar, is just that....red, red, red. It is huge and decorated like a luxury bordello. There are many private and comfortable seating areas with sofas, large chairs, etc. Also, a long bar and friendly bartenders. It is not a restaurant but they do have a bar menu. We tried the restaurant off the lobby called Bin 36 and were rather disappointed with it. It was loud, crowded and not comfortable. Our food was not cooked as requested and the efficient but not gracious waitress said that's just how they do it, then reluctantly offered to take it back. I noted in my hotel survey that since there are dozens of great restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel (including several within two blocks), that I would have no reason to return to Bin 36. Again, the manager was apologetic and promised to make it better. Overall, I loved this hotel and highly recommend it. Everything within the hotel itself is very well done, beautiful and comfortable and the amenities are excellent. The location is ideal. And I got a very good rate for my stay.

The only drawback is parking. It was $40 a day, and the lot right across the street was $15 a day. Wish I would have used that one and spent $30 instead of $80...but they come and snatch up your car right away and you think that is the thing to do. Our car never left the lot for 3 days, so it really could have been parked across the street. Our rooms were nice and clean and large. It really is a fun stay for right downtown.

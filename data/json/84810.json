The room was very big and nicely furnished, everything clean as a whistle. The decor is hodge podge but its done nicely, very shabby chic.

I came across some reviews for Record Parkside and thought \"how bad can it be\"?, considering there are some major hotels in the area that guests report are dirty, dismal and downright frightening. When I first checked in, I could see the hotel was old, probably built in the 1970's (or even 1960s), pre-Disney. But from the outside everything looked clean and cared-for, very similar to the 'Mom and Pop\" motels our family would stay at on road trips when I was a kid. The room itself was just your average motel room - bed, dresser/television and bathroom. There is certainly some wear around the edges, but nothing significant. Then, as my trip continued, I noticed how CLEAN everything was. No dust, no spots, no stains. Sure, there is rust on the mirror frame; the towels are thinning; and there have been some 'creative' handyman repairs, but I didn't worry about things crawling on me at night, or find any mold in the shower. I would say, it's a lot like staying at a family members' house, that you haven't seen for a while. Everything is clean, they are welcoming, but you can't help notice some things that you would 'never' do if you had guests over! lol I would easily stay here again, and best of all, even though it was Spring Break, everything was quiet and generally peaceful. There seemed to be mostly older, retired types staying here, and not until my last night - a Friday - did I notice some more colorful characters. The one thing I didn't realize is the motel is on a major tourist highway, so you're surrounded by cheap shops and attractions. But the rooms themselves are set back about 100 feet or so from the highway, so while traffic can be rough, excess noise was not a problem.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4600709", "Content": "The only thing keeping me from giving this the highest ranking is that the first 3 days we were there the heater in the pool was broken.

Peek out the front since the doors were wide open and what do you know she's around the corner in a little nook smoking a cigarette. And when I told Debbie the night clerk what the issue was there was no empathy whatsoever. All she said was well what kind of bugs are they. Lady I don't know I am not an exterminator!

The beds sleep quite comfortably, and there's a huge cable channel selection. Compimentary wireless internet service is provided.

As well, this hotel features an enormous pool; it's no wonder another TripAdvisor member complained they felt the pool was cold, as the pool is significantly larger than what one would find at a newer property. The deep end truly is deep--thirteen feet, in fact. It is attractively landscaped and appeared very clean. There is a complimentary breakfast buffet provided in the mornings that is amply stocked with a selection of juices, cinnamon rolls, eggs, cereals, and two meats. There were also biscuits and gravy served; it is a must to serve the gravy on the biscuits to help soften them. I was immediately reminded of the \"fighting muffins\" from the first Charlie's Angels film, and that's not an exaggeration. The hotel staff was extremely polite and courteous. The facility itself, while dated, is clean and presentable. I would definitely recommend this property to families traveling with children, but there is one small warning to pass: the doors on this property do not have any sort of spring-loaded arm to ensure a slow, quiet closure. Instead, every door I encountered swung closed rapidly. I could see a small child getting their hand or arm caught if they were not paying attention.

Rather, it seems to be an old, rundown, ancient Holiday Inn that they decided put Express on the end of...I guess to lure unsuspecting travelers. Anyway...stained carpets, lights that don't work, poor color on the TV, uncomfortable bed, terrible looking shower (probably not dirty, just looks to be) were just a few things i noticed upon entering the room. To make my point even stronger...I am NOT picky when it comes to hotels. Just give me a clean room and a comfy bed and you won't hear a peep. But this place....this place SUCKS. Not to mention it was $290/night...granted, it is Rolex 24hrs of Daytona weekend, but $290?!?!?!? Move the decimal point one spot and I think you have a more realistic price for this HOLE.", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDropping off college student\u201d", "Author": "jluczak", "ReviewID": "UR3812909", "Content": "We stayed at this property when we were taking our son to college in the Daytona Beach area. We we arrived in Daytona, we needed a hotel that provided a sofa sleeper, as we had two adults, and two teenagers, one girl, one boy. Not only did we have a sofa sleeper, but it was located in a small seperate room with a second TV and another small sofa. Lots of room, very comfortable. Our daughter even continued to sleep on the sleeper sofa, after one of the double beds was freed up. The desk staff were very friendly, and always spoke when we passed by. The morning breakfast was very nice. As was the pool. We didn't get to spend much time there, but we plan to stay at this hotel when we visit our son at school.

Decided to stop for dinner and find a room. The Holiday Inn Express is located close to I-95 and just down the road from where we stopped for dinner. The only available room was a smoking room so we agreed (its only for one night, right?). Unfortunately for us, as nonsmokers, the smell in the room was really gross. We tolerated it for the night and won't ever again. The complimentary continental breakfast was more than expected. There was plenty of food and much to choose from. The eating area was clean and nice. We didn't get a chance to check out the grounds so I cannot comment on that. I would not discourage anyone from staying here. Its not the closest to the beach if you want a beach vacation and if you're a nonsmoker, don't get a smoking room.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service sells this hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3317660", "Content": "I would definitely stay here again. During a week-long \"tour\" of Florida, my husband and I stayed here for two days. Out of the four hotels we stayed in, this was our favorite. The continental breakfast was more than we have seen offered in other hotels. The accommodations are clean and spacious. If you're a NASCAR fan, this hotel is conveniently located near the Daytona Speedway. It is also only a short drive to the beach. Most importantly, the staff was very professional and kind. The smiling front desk attendants were a welcome sight after a long drive. Also, check out the Ale House next door. Excellent food for reasonable prices...save room for dessert.

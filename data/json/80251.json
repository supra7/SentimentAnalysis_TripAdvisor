The location is wonderful-right on the beach. Rooms were attractive, and the hotel was close to restaurants. The problems we encountered were with the room itself. We stayed in a King, Balcony View room. The bathroom was not cleaned well. There were hairs on the floor and some mildew. The next problem arose in the late afternoon. We heard the shower very loudly from the adjacent room. The adjacent bathroom must be directly behind the head board of the bed. When I called the front desk, I was told that people come off the beach and it should end soon. We went out for dinner and turned in for the night at 11pm. In the middle of the night approximately 2am, we were awakened by the sound of rushing water. This went on for 40 minutes! It was impossible to sleep. I have stayed in many hotels and motels and have never encountered water sound as loud as this establishment. The sound was loud enough to record on my iphone which I did play back for the front desk to hear. This was supposed to be more of an upscale hotel. I'm surprised they do not invest in sound insulation between the guest rooms. Fortunately, we were only booked for one night. It would have been nice if the font desk offered to change our room after our first noise complaint at 5pm, rather than shrug the complaint off and tell us to wait it out. It makes one wonder if their rooms other rooms have the same problem.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belen, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSan Diego on the beach!\u201d", "Author": "Evelyn B", "ReviewID": "UR126587391", "Content": "The people who work this hotel work well as a team.

I accidentally left them in the room (completely my fault) and by the time I had realized it, I was three hours into my drive home back to Arizona. I called the hotel as soon as I arrived home, so at this point I had been checked out less than 24 hours. I explained to the front desk the dresses I had left, along with my room number. They called me back about 30 minutes later to say they did not locate the dresses. I asked to speak to the housekeeper who cleaned our room after we checked out as well as the housekeeping manager. They refused to allow me to speak to them, which pretty much tells me that their housekeeping policy is to take what is not theirs. I called several times in the next week and each time no one allowed me to speak to the housekeeping manager or the manager of the hotel. I am upset with myself for forgetting these dresses, but I am very upset that Ocean Park Inn apparently does not allow people to discuss issues with their management. Clearly they are hiding that someone took my dresses and do not want to speak to me about it. I urge anyone who goes here to not leave any valuables in their room for any period of time because apparently their housekeeping staff has sticky fingers and the management turns the other cheek.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "wanderercf", "ReviewID": "UR119459554", "Content": "Perfect location in PB, right on the water but walking distance to shops and restaurants.

How awesome is that? These guys are the best!!! All of the staff ave very accommodating and nice, but these guys are \"the bomb\"! They usually have coupons for discounts at various places in the area so ask them - they will be glad to help you out. Parking is $10.00 a nite in their own underground parking garage. Spaces are somewhat small, so larger vehicles may have a bit of a tight fit. Considering that on the weekends, and any holiday, parking in the area is nonexistent, this is a great plus to have available at this price. It is also gated so that you can feel secure when coming or going. The hotel is right on the Boardwalk which is a constant flurry of activity. Be it people walking, jogging, on roller blades, skate boards or bicycles. If you like people watching, you will have plenty of that here. The boardwalk extends for 3 miles all the way to South Mission Beach. There are many shops, restaraunts, bars, rentals and snack shops along the way. (check out the Fish Tacos at the Pacific Beach Shore club right next to the hotel!) Views from the Ocean view rooms are breathtaking to say the least. At sunset everyone along the boardwalk stops what they are doing, and watches as the sun goes down. Each balcony has a small table and 2 chairs making it a perfect cozy place to relax and just chill watching the people or the sunset. As one guest mentioned here, the water pressure in the shower is fantastic - something you don't often find in hotels. There's lots of counter space and the bathroom is roomy compared to many hotels often cramped bathrooms. People have mentioned the homeless that tend to hang out on the boardwalk near the hotel. I spend quite a bit of time walking around the boardwalk and sometimes standing near them and have never, ever been approached or ever felt threatened in any way (I am a single female). This year in fact, there were less than previous years and police presense was higher than any other year (perhaps because it was Labor Day Weekend?) I would not even consider the homeless as a factor in not choosing this hotel. The \"Beach Flies\" are quite harmless. As mentioned by others here, there is a nice flat panel TV, small microwave and mini fridge in the room. The beds are a bit soft for my taste and I'm not sure that they have changed since I started staying here, but I did not have a problem getting a good nite's sleep. Listening to the waves crash onto the beach is quite soothing! Love sleeping with the sliding glass door open. I love, love, love the Ocean Park Inn and can't wait to return next year.

Yes there's transients on the boardwalk in front of the hotel, but I stay at the Gaslamp Hilton and have to tell them no every time I walk down the road. At least the ones in front of the hotel leave you alone as the cops make frequent trips on the boardwalk to enforce your privacy. Yes there's a band on certain nights that play music late into the night. It's a beach atmosphere, Has anyone been to Miami or Cabo lately? I love sitting on my balcony with a few cold ones, listening to the music and watching the wide variety of people go by. Do they enforce the non Smoking rules. Yes they do and thats a huge reason I go there. i cant stand smoky rooms that all these guests love to say they didn't smoke in yet they'll stand on the balcony and light up, ignorant to the fact they bring it in with them which stinks up everything they touch. Funny I never got a bill for smoking. Keep enforcing this one for me! I called and spoke with the manager 3 years ago that I wanted to make the OPI my regular hotel on business and vacations which has resulted in a great rate and better treatment than I get at the best Hilton's. They treat you like family and check throughout to make sure I have what I need and everything is satisfactory. The place is always clean, the pool is spotless with nice furniture, The view is amazing and the parking is gated and secure which is nice when we get home late from an event.

There is a jacuzzi and swimming pool surrounded by plexi glass to cut any winds, which was nice since the beach was a bit windy. They serve a continental breakfast with waffles and danish, juice, coffee, cereal, milk fruit etc. Pretty nice and free! But the staff there is outstanding. Sachin and Patrick at the desk were the best! We were always greeted with smiles and greetings. They were both very accomodating with our every need and didn't make you feel at all like a bother to them. We were offered beach chairs and towels when they heard we were off to the beach and suggested some great eating spots when we asked. I forgot my credit card at check out and Sachin biked 2 blocks to where we were eating to return it to me. I would recommend this hotel if you don't want the usual mediocre beach pad.

The continental breakfast each morning included fresh fruit, cereals, DIY Belgian waffles, pastries, bagels, muffins, juices, etc. and was excellent. The parking spaces are below the hotel, and most are too small for anything over a midsized vehicle, but it was nice to not have to waste time looking for a parking spot along the street somewhere (parking wasn't free, but was only $10/day if I recall correctly). I've read that some reviewers had problems with noise from an establishment next door, but neither I, nor a fellow traveler in a different ocean front room had any problems with noise at our rooms. That problem might be only with certain rooms (not ocean-facing). The staff was fantastic. I definitely recommend stopping by the front-desk if you have any questions at all (traffic/travel routes, local eateries, etc.). And the room itself was very clean and everything worked as it should (including the free wifi, a microwave, small dorm-sized fridge and nice-sized flat screen tv). Also, the pool and hot tub were both spotlessly clean and well-maintained. OPI seems like a good place to stay no matter what you're doing in the San Diego area. It's only about 20 minute drive to the Gaslamp/East Village/Old Town area, and about the same to the Torrey Pines area to the north. If you don't have a rental car and can't get away, you probably won't miss it, since you're literally on the beach and can walk to several good eats and shops, and there's also Belmont Park down the boardwalk (to the south) where they have carnival rides & a roller coaster. Lots of fun near OPI within walking distance. On my last day in San Diego, I took a later flight so I could find a place to go hiking and Torrey Pines SRA is just a short drive north of OPI.

After searching for many options in Pacific Beach (aka PB), Mission Beach and La Jolla, I realized I made a great decision once arriving at Ocean Park Inn. Greeted by friendly staff, I experienced easy check-in and was provided a pass to their underground, secure parking garage. A $10 value worth every penny -- parking is very limited on Pacific Beach. Staff was very professional, accommodating and very hospitable. In fact, each time I met them in the lobby they remembered my first name the entire week. Let's talk accommodations. In addition to being in the heart of Pacific Beach activity with great \"beach front\" restaurants, lots of healthy runners and being ON THE BEACH, the hotel rooms are extremely clean, good size and have incredible views. Although it was a little cool at night, I opened my sliding door to the view and sounds of the ocean. Sure, it has a little dated charm to it, but fixtures and furniture are all updated, nicely painted and kept in great working order. Although Ocean Park Inn isn't part of a major brand hotel chain (which are limited on Pacific Beach), they offer many of the same amenities. I would say it's similar to a beach front \"Holiday Inn Express\" or \"Hilton Garden Inn\". But I have to say, neither of these chains I've experienced had views like the Ocean Park Inn! Hot tub was hot. Pool was clean, lighted and modern. Pool towels laid out on wicker pool chairs each morning. From the pool area you constantly hear the roar of the waves onto the shore day and night. Location was great. Don't worry about being \"too far\" from the San Diego life. During non-rush hours, you're only 7 minutes from I-5 (aka \"the 5\"), only 15-20 minutes from downtown San Diego & airport to the South, and from LaJolla to the North. Even if it takes you a little longer with traffic, the stay at Ocean Park Inn is definitely worth it. If you're going to a beach city, you might as well stay on the beach. And the noticeably present San Diego police keep the place fairly quiet and safe. Unfortunately, there is a small population of homeless on PB and around the hotel area. Most of the time, they keep to themselves and do not bother anyone. In addition to the San Diego Police, the main PB Life Guard Station is 100 feet from the hotel. For 20-30's crowd there are a lot of night life options around the hotel. At times you can hear music, but it's faint. Although the 20-30's crowd is a good majority on PB, there is good presence of families and baby boomers walking and living in the area. My guess is that the family/younger crowd increases quite a bit in the summertime when the beaches really open up. Clientele in the hotel was a mix of all ages and families. Price was right on the mark for this hotel. I hesitate to say it was a great price for what you get in fear of Ocean Park Inn raising their rates. :-) But after researching almost 20 hotels in the area, I found this one to be the best price for the view, quality, safety, accommodations and service.

If I stay again (and I want to) I'd ask for an oceanfront on the other half of the building away from the bar. Went til about 2am, and was quite obnoxious on a Sat night...but...the waves were so loud it partially drowned out the noise. So - something to be cautious of. Parking was extremely convenient! I was able to keep my car there the whole next day before I drove out of San Diego, which was really nice. The rooms got a 3 for clean. At first glance they seem ok, however I travel so much for business I've learned to tear apart and inspect certain areas for certain critters (my room was clean of signs of those) -- but there were layers upon layers of dust everywhere behind the scenes. Months of not vac'ing or getting behind the cracks or furniture. However - the room view was so awesome I could overlook it. Bed was ok, I mean, it's not a Hilton resort, and I didn't wake up sore. I did wake up with the sunshine and waves, and ate a peaceful breakfast on my patio, then wandered to north Pacific Beach and Tourmaline Beach and found awesome colorful shells for jewelry, a whole sand dollar (3.5\" in diameter!), lots of wins and epic fails watching the surfers, and some fossil hunting on the cliffs.

From check-in through checkout, the staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Yes it's rather expensive, but you walk right onto the boardwalk which directly fronts the beach. We were furnished towels for the pool, spa and beach. The breakfast features do it yourself waffles, cereals, pastries, muffins, yogurts, fruit, juices, milk and coffee. The room with the two queens looked out over the alleyway and could get noisy at night. The Firehouse BAR & Grill next door really hops Friday - Sunday nights and can get quite noisy. The food at Firehouse was mediocre at best - a medium rare to go burger came extra well done and was ridiculously small. Cheesesteak sandwiches were okay.This is obviously a major hot spot and it's not for the food. The hotel is constantly maintained, just watch Todd doing cleaning and chemical balancing every morning on the pool and spa! There's outdoor showers when you enter in from the boardwalk to rinse off the major amounts of sand clinging to every part of your body. What a treat to boogie board for hours, be able to come rinse off all the stuff and then jump into the crystal clear pool and hot spa. (No wetsuits in pool please!). It's a high 3 star property. But it pays for itself in location, customer service and amenities. High speed internet is hit and miss, worked better in one room than the other and sometimes went in and out. The parking garage can be VERY cramped for anything larger than a compact car, but it seems very secure.

The price was very reasonable compared to other properties located directly on the beach. The location is fantastic....right in the middle of everything you could want, with lots of shops, grocery stores, restaurants, bike and surf rentals, etc. all within walking distance. The amenities are great if you are on a budget, including a decent size mini-fridge and microwave. The free continental breakfast has everything you could ask for, including industrial size belgian waffle makers. BTW...that loud beep (which could double for air raid siren) means you need to turn the waffle over! The room is comfortable and clean. We had an ocean view corner room on the third floor with a nice balcony. I forgot to ask about the king bed in advance, so we had a queen, but it was very comfortable and the linens used were nice and seemed upscale. There was also a great flat screen tv mounted on the wall, but there were so many activities, we didn't watch it much. The parking is priced reasonably at 10 dollars per day and is in a gated underground garage, so the security was good. One pleasant surprise was the staff. Everyone was very friendly and accomodating, and always smiled and asked how our stay was going. I proposed to my fiance during the trip and we asked the front desk to to take our picture in the lobby the day it happened. When we returned from dinner, we were surprised to find a note of congratulations along with a chilled bottle of champagne and two glasses, a very nice touch. On another day, we misplaced our Zoo tickets that we printed from home. The gentlemen at the front desk was a big help by logging into our account and printing the PDF out again. Another nice touch... each afternoon, we would find fresh lemonade waiting at the pool. The pool was very clean and quiet with lots of chairs and fresh towels laid out for the guests. There was an outdoor shower and a door that you could use to access the beach directly from the pool. THe only negative others might have (we stayed up late and weren't really bothered) was that the sports bar next door had music playing nightly that you could hear from the room. If this bothers you, consider asking the hotel to book you in one of the rooms away from the side street.

The hotel was in the process of upgrades during my last stay. My room had not been updated yet - it was in dire need of new bedding I will admit. The bed was quite uncomfortable. The TV was out dated - they were replacing them with wall mounted flat screens however. They were also painting all of the hallways - I see someone mentioned the hallways were not air conditioned - I don't spend time in the hallway, so I don't see why this would matter - I never noticed the hallways being uncomfortable. I used the pool area quite a bit to tan, and was usually the only one there. Pool area is great. I have read some reviews stating that the management and staff were rude, that the area is noisy, and there are people hanging around the hotel. I had absolutely no problems with any of the staff on either of my stays. Each one was consistently helpful, courteous - almost to a fault!, and friendly. Jay, Chanel, Patrick, Sachin and Karelia - made my stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel is on the Pacific Beach boardwalk - there is noise. There are people on the boardwalk, rollerblading, skateboarding, biking, walking and jogging from early morning to evening. The beach is also immediately off the boardwalk - what do people expect?!? For there to be no one on the beach and no one on the boardwalk? If you want quiet and solitude, stay on an island. It's Pacific Beach, it's a beach community - it is what it is. I never found the noise to be over-whelming and slept with my slider open every nite. Yes, there are a number of homeless that stay directly in front of the hotel on the boardwalk - they keep to themselves and don't bother anyone. I never saw them approach anyone at any time. They are gone by early evening. Traveling alone, I never felt afraid to be near them at any time-in fact I talked to some of them. They are harmless. T The continental breakfast changed last year and didn't offer as much as it did the year before (there were waffle makers the year before). However, there were several varieties of fresh bagels, packaged pastries, toast, butter, jelly's, cream cheese, fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, juice and milk. Just like any other continental breakfast FOR FREE. I'm just not sure what people expect. It was quite adequate. I would rather not have a full breakfast offered in lieu of keeping costs down. Again, having walked up and down the boardwalk, there are some really trashy places to stay - including the Best Western that are old, outdated, filthy and run down. Yes, there are a few nicer places like Tower 23 but the cost is also considerably higher.

We did a lot of research prior to the vacation to find a hotel that would fit our needs of location, moderate cost, pool, free breakfast, and overall value. I was having a very difficult time finding a hotel under $250/night that had decent reviews and had the important amenities we were looking for (e.g. accessible to restaurants, pool, breakfast). We were very pleased with our choice of the Ocean Park Inn and glad that we positioned our vacation in Pacific Beach. Prior to booking a room, I called the front desk to ask about the difference types of rooms and which rooms were affected by the neighboring bar's noise (from prior reviews). We booked a limited view king-bed room on the hotel website because it was the best value in our opinion (compared to the slightly more expensive partial view and most expensive ocean view); the front desk let us check out a partial view room when we arrived in case we wanted to upgrade. We stayed with our limited view room because it had better light / larger sliding glass door and was conveniently on the ground floor so we could walk right out to the hotel pool every day. There are partitions between the rooms and the pool, so we didn't feel that there was less privacy from facing the pool on the ground floor. If any rooms have less privacy it would be the ocean front rooms because the hotel is only a few feet off the boardwalk. But the views of the ocean surf are fantastic! We walked out to the Crystal Pier for amazing sunsets when we weren't enjoying the sunset at a boardwalk restaurant. The room was clean and updated, slightly unexpected after reading prior posts, with the exception of the outdated light teal bathroom (but it was very spacious and clean so we didn't mind). Our king bed was comfortable (and huge!), we had a mini-fridge to stock beer and snacks for pool time, and we were happy with the very convenient location right on the boardwalk and within walking distance of many restaurants along the Pacific Beach area. Our room had a loveseat, small closet, wardrobe, and a desk. We rented a car for our vacation so that we could explore other neighborhoods every morning until the sun came out around noon every day. Parking was very reasonable ($10) whereas it seems that every other hotel in the San Diego area charged $30/day! We enjoyed being able to drive straight down Garnet Ave (only a block or two north of Grand Ave) to Trader Joe's for getting beer, wine, and snacks. We were able to look up restaurants, directions, and lots of info on their FREE wireless internet connection, which was great and rare! Bring your laptop! The front desk was very helpful, in allowing us to ensure we had chosen the best room for us, recommending restaurants and other helpful suggestions. Jay, especially, was very friendly and helpful. After reading reviews that the front desk was staffed by teenage kids that didn't care about their customers, this was a relief. Breakfast was a little spare, but they had cereal, bagels, juice, yogurt, and (cheap) coffee. We were expecting the Belgian waffle maker previously mentioned or at least something with a little protein, so it was disappointing, but free. There was a family there telling us about all the great breakfast fare (eggs, waffles) they enjoyed during their stay there a few months earlier, so I know they have the ability to provide a more satisfying breakfast! It was apparently not busy enough that weekend to provide their superior breakfast foods. All-in-all, this was a great choice for us. Pros: free wireless internet! free breakfast until 10am, enclosed outdoor pool (for wind protection), right on boardwalk, clean/bright rooms and good value, unlimited towels for pool/beach, affordable private parking, friendly employees, and great location in Pacific Beach neighborhood to ocean and nearby restaurants (see other TripAdvisor reviews: try the Green Flash and the Fishery, avoid Gringos Cantina)... Cons: breakfast a little minimal, hot tub turns off at 10pm, can be noisy but only if in a room facing bar behind the hotel (ask front desk), no onsite restaurant but they offer room service from the neighboring bar & grill (Firehouse?)...", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "vb", "Title": "\u201cmixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "rewyanc", "ReviewID": "UR30513759", "Content": "THis place is in a goiod location if you want to be on the boardwalk and next to the beach.

The bathrooms were in good shape, and the beds were firm but comfortable. Also, the continental breakfast is quite reasonable. The garage is located under the inn. I would say the price is somewhat high if just staying overnight. Never got a chance to go into the pool as it was cool out, but I can say it was on the small side (but, hey, this is a beach inn we're talking about.)

The music was SO loud and people were partying and screaming until 2 or 3am. It sounded like it was right outside our window. There was NO way to sleep through the night. We found out the following night that ONLY the rooms facing this bar get the interruption. So if you're staying there, opt for a room away from that section and get a quiet sleep. The UGLY: I called the front desk at midnight to ask when the music would stop - they said 1:30 am. It went later than this. The hotel did not offer me to switch rooms and I didn't think to ask since I assumed all the rooms had this noise level from the bar.

The daily continental breakfast was a big plus - very clean presentation. The beds are very comfortable, the shower had nice flow.

The only fair way would be to split the review of the hotel from the area. Some of the problems my family(hubby and 2 teens) encountered were not the fault of the hotel. Yet the area is usually how most choose their hotel. The Ocean Park Inn: Even though I made reservations 6 months in advance they were not able to accomodate us in the same room for a week. The first 2 nights we stayed in a 2 room suite that overlooked their very nice and warm pool. This room had a large balcony(could fit 4 chairs) and a nice small view of the ocean. You could hear the ocean if you kept your patio door/windows open at night. The room was clean, decorated nicely and had a full size table and kitchenette. We really liked this room and pleaded with them to let us stay in it even though we would be giving up the full oceanview. It was perfect for the 4 of us. My teens could stay up later since it had a TV in the living/kitchen area and also one in the bedroom. Since they do assign rooms at the time of reservation we had to move to our 1 room oceanview room. This room was very spacious but not nearly as nice. It needed updating and the bathroom was in desparate need of caulking. The patio screen door was broke but they did fix it immediately when I called. The balcony was very small and could only hold 2 small chairs. This was the kind of room that even when cleaned(which they did a great job on) did not look like it because it was old and needed work. Showers in both rooms had excellent water pressure. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. The continental breakfast was fabulous. Waffles, eggs, variety of cereals and the best cinnamon rolls and other pastries. I grade a continental breakfast on the serving of some kind of protein and they got an A+. Parking in their garage was an issue. We had rented a small SUV and most parking spots were for compact cars only. We had a very difficult time parking our car, often having to take up 2 compact spots, which everyone was having to do, which resulted in less spots. Also, if you came in late at night-forget about it. With updating and their doing work in the rooms, this hotel could be a 4* hotel. Our first room was great, our 2nd was not. Pacific Beach: The beach area and boardwalk were not clean. When asked, I was told they clean every Friday. Once a week is not enough with the amount of people in the area. Water temp was great@74degrees. However, we did not like the amount of seaweed that would wrap around you when playing in the waves. My teens loved the surf area which is separate from the swim area. The Pacifc Beach Surf Shop across from the hotel is the place to go for lessons and rentals. Gave us a discount since both kids got lessons and even gave us a 2 for 1 rental on skateboards. This is not an area for kids. I was not happy that my 2 teens were exposed to an area of heavy drinking. Open street bars everywhere and many adults were walking around that obviously had too much to drink. The bars were filled to capacity(seen as walking down the boardwalk) even during the day. Average age in the twenties. Felt we could put up with during the day but not good at night. I disagree with the previous reviewer, the area by this hotel is crowded. There were police patrolling and they were kept busy. Every night at least one big fight in the area. Usually over a girl. We read on this site about the homeless and were prepared. They sleep out on the benches on the boardwalk directly across from the oceanview rooms. Most are quiet but not always. I called the front desk at 5am one morning because of all the noise. They did send a security person out to ask the homeless to leave the area, which they did. The boardwalk is very busy, at least in August, with a lot of noise and partying crowds walking by until about 1-2am. For this reason, I cannot recommend this hotel to families, unless they reserved a room in the back of the hotel and off the boardwalk. We did not have any of these problems with our first room we had that was back by the pool. As you can see, this was a difficult review. Maybe a month other than August would be different. See my San Diego Crowds review. We liked having a Ralphs grocer, 7Eleven and numerous restaurants nearby. Just north of our hotel was Tower 23 and Pacific Terrace Hotel, both much quieter but a lot more expensive. A few blocks south was the Best Western, more in the mission beach area which is quieter. All are directly on the beach and boardwalk. The Pacific was on a bluff and had a lot of stairs to the beach.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "k-ro99", "ReviewID": "UR7992466", "Content": "Stayed from June 19-21.

We had a 3rd floor, ocean front room with king bed & pull-out sofa, refrigerator, and microwave. We arrived early on the 21st, and OPI accommodated us by getting us in the room by 12:00. They also allowed us to keep our car parked in the garage until 3:00 on our day of departure so we could enjoy more beach time. The room was a basic hotel room but everything was functional, clean, and in good condition. While we were there, they were painting the exterior - can be a pain to deal with maintenance like this when a guest; however, the workers were circumspect, and I'm always pleased to see hotels invest in their properties, instead of just milk profits out of it. The balcony off the room was very tiny, but sufficient to sit and enjoy a morning coffee or evening wine. The sound of the ocean from the room is lovely. The continental breakfast is a little basic - definitely room for improvement. However, when we were there, the staff was getting instructions on a waffle machine, so there may be upgrades coming there! Across the cul-de-sac street from the hotel was a small shop called Pacific Beach Surf Shop. They have a larger shop a block down in same complex as Hooters. Danny at the Grand Ave shop was awesome - very helpful to my son, who signed up for surf lessons. We enjoyed meals at Nicks and Green Flash (strong drinks!)

I paid over $650 for the stay, made the extra effort to call and confirm the floor that I wanted and I certainly would have paid an extra $20 to make sure that I got the oceanview, if anyone had mentioned it. The Manager then tried to sell me on a second floor room with two Queen Beds, when I wanted a King Bed, for an additional $50 per night ($150). I was checking in early on a Thursday, and could hardly believe that all the rooms were occupied. As we discussed the options, the story changed at the Manager's convenience. They had at least two such rooms, but none with a King. I feel that the procedures of the hotel lend themsleves to a bait and switch type dynamic. Service was hit and miss.

You can take the no.8/ 9 to Sea World also from the same stop. The breakfast in the hotel is poor. So bring your own. There is fat-laden pastries, sugar cereals and very sweet bagels and bread.

In fact, I have booked a reservation in December. This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and I just love it. First of all, the hotel overlooks the ocean. You are ON the beach. Some people have complained about accommodations and service at this hotel, and granted, it is NOT the Ritz Carlton. I found the staff to be hard-working, and at times, over-worked, but friendly. I've also found that if you are nice, patient and friendly with people; they are likewise with you. We arrived in San Diego on Friday around 12:30 PM. Our room at the Ocean Park Inn was not yet ready, as they had 100 percent occupancy, and had to get the rooms cleaned for check-ins. Check-in time is 3 PM. My boyfriend and I parked our rental car in the OPI lot, and walked around the beach and went to lunch. When we checked back at 2:30 PM, our room was ready. I had booked a king, partial ocean view room on Expedia. This room was facing the pool, and beyond that, the ocean. Basically, it was an ocean front room without the ocean-front price!!!! We were thrilled!!!! This hotel is in such a great location that you don't really need a car. Unless you are going to SeaWorld or exploring San Diego, there is everything within walking distance to the hotel. My boyfriend and I walked so much that our legs and feet are sore!!! Across the street is a Ralph's grocery store; Starbucks; UNO restaurant (best pizza in town! great place!); Sketchers; Long's Drug Store; Jack in the Box; Wells Fargo ATM; 7-11. Down the street a bit is Rubio's and LaSalsa for fresh Mexican food, Taco Bell and Burger King. Next to the hotel is Taylor's Restaurant (which is good, but not great); Joe's Crab Shack (also good); and lots more of everything. For live music, try Blind Melon's (now 710 Ocean Avenue or something like that ) at the pier (two blocks away). They feature different music nightly, all of it good. For nightlife information, get a free San Diego READER magazine. For t-shirt or other beachwear shopping, try the beach front shops about 4 blocks south of the hotel. They have the BEST prices on sunglasses, postcards, t-shirts, hats, swimwear, etc. WAVE is a little pricey; try the unnamed \"mom and pop\" shops just past the Best Western and Surfer hotels. The OPI also offers a free continental breakfast, with cereals, fruit, bagels, sweet rolls, a variety of juices and coffee. Parking is now $7.00 per night, in a secured, underground garage. There is a microwave, refrigerator, in-room safe, hair dryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board in each room. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean. I much prefer OPI over the Best Western Blue Sea Lodge, because it is smaller and cleaner, and it caters more to families and couples than wild party people. I was very glad to be staying at the OPI instead of the Surfer Hotel, Blue Sea Lodge or other adjacent hotels, because the beach this past weekend was like Spring Break. Lots of wild, noisy, drunk 20-somethings...but none of them appeared to be staying at Ocean Park Inn. I also much prefer Pacific Beach to Ocean Beach. Ocean Beach is in an older, lower-income section of town, and I just did not feel safe in that area in general. While Pacific Beach has its share of homeless people, they tend to mind their own business. I felt quite safe walking at any time of the day or night on Pacific Beach, and there always seems to be people walking around, regardless of the hour.

First of all the rooms are much prettier than the Blue Seas down the street but I wouldn't say the beds are more comfortable. It took me about 30 minutes just to find the closet behing the mirror. The rooms come with a desk with a dataport and microwave and frig. However, the Blue Seas also has these things not to mention free wireless internet. The main problem with this hotel for about the last year and a half is the construction of the new lifeguard tower right at the end of the street that the hotel is situated on. Since their parking is underneath the hotel, all the construction made it very difficult to get in and out of the parking garage. The one plus about their parking is that it is free whereas the BW Blue Sea Lodge right down the street in Mission Beach charges $6 or $7 a night for their parking and they have underground and outside parking. In Pacific Beach, however, it doesn't matter where you stay, all parking places are very tiny and now even more so with the rage for SUVs. Anyway, the pool is not as large as the one at the Pacific Terrace or the Blue Sea, but it is warm, and the jacuzzi is nice. However, their pool area closes at 10. Well, they say it closes at 10pm. The last time I stayed at this hotel, there were several of us in the jacuzzi having a pleasant conversation, enjoying the evening. At about 9pm/9:15, management shut off the jacuzzi. Then at around 9:30/9:45, they shut the lights off in the pool area. I couldn't believe it. We had been looking forward to using the pool area all day at a time when there would be less children, and they closed it early. When we complained, the security guard person became very rude and asked us to leave!! Now, this hotel admittedly has a beautiful view of the beach and the ocean, but just like every other property in Pacific Beach or Mission Beach you do have the problem of homeless people and once in a while a drunk causing trouble right outside your windown on the boardwalk. But that comes with the territory. This is a big city, and there are homeless people who live down on the beach, and it is a college party town so there will be drunks. But I think the sound of the ocean at night and the proximity to the beach makes up for most of it. I never feel unsafe in Pacific Beach. I just use good judgment. At any rate, I have had problems with this hotel with billing. I have never gotten a straight answer from the front desk on whether or not 800 number calls are free or charged. Sometimes they are free and sometimes not. Also, I had a problem with the hotel releasing the hold they had on my credit card after the charge had already come through. I had to make several calls to the hotel after I got home from my trip, and was sassed by an employee over the phone and told I should just wait. Well, I called again a few days later and complained, and miraculously the hold was finally released. The Blue Sea Lodge and the Ocean Park Inn charge about the same for their room rates and there are a lot of pros and cons of both properties, but after the incident at the pool, I don't think I'll stay there again. During one of my stays at this hotel, my friend, who walks with a cane, asked if she could have a room close to the elevators. They put her in the last room at the end of the hall in the wing on the other side of the pool, as far from the elevators as she could get. When she asked if they would move her, they told her there was nothing they could do about it. Well, it happened to me the next time I stayed there with family, and I immediately called the desk and insisted they move us, which they did. So sometimes they are accomodating and sometimes there are not. I have to admit this property is in much better repair that the Blue Sea, and I have been there many times, twice when the pool was shut down, and once when the elevator was broken. I have even considered staying at the Pacific Terrace, but for much the same situation, they charge about double, so I have put up with the situations at these two properties. Again, even though the rooms are nicer at the OPI than at the BSL, I probably will not stay at this hotel again and will return to the BSL where I am treated better and they have warm chocolate chip cookies waiting for me at my arrival!!!!! Also, at the BSL, if the room is not what you want, they will work with you until you find just the perfect room. One time, they gave me about 6 keys and told me to go check them out and pick the one I wanted. How's that for accomodating. Another reason why I would choose that hotel over the OPI. Just remember, none of these properties are the Ritz Carlton. They are in a tourist/resort town and get heavy traffic and heavy abuse!!!!!!!", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBum Problems On The Boardwalk\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5226091", "Content": "While we have stayed several times at the Ocean Park Inn and have enjoyed our room, the hotel has definitely acquired a bum problem.

As of today 3/8/06 I still had not received the refund and was shocked to see that I still had a reservation there. When I called the hotel and spoke to Jade, she informed me only the GM could cancel the reservation, and that he would have to review the account to make sure I could do this. When I asked what that meant, she said that is the policy. I don't know about anyone else, but I have never been refused to cancel a reservation especially when it meets all the requirements, which in this case was a 72 hour notice, I am giving close to 72 days notice.

But it might be good to ask the hotel for a room on 1st or 2nd floor when you book (my room was on 1st) In summary: good value for your money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c recommendable.", "Date": "May 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3460444", "Content": "My husband and I spent our anniversary here and LOVED it. The construction on the balconies is long gone, and the constuction of the new lifeguard headquarters didn't bother us a bit. Each morning we woke up to the sites and sounds of the ocean- which was exactly what we were looking for. Breakfast at the hotel was good, but you have to try breakfast at Konos just up the boardwalk (about 2 blks north). It's well worth the wait! Our room was clean and functional (nothing fancy) and the bathroom was extremely clean with great water pressure in the shower- which was important to my husband! The hotel is small, so it was quiet and parking in the gated underground parking was easy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Pacific beach is centrally located, so trips South to Coronado or North La Jolla were just 10-15 minutes by car.

Yes, there is construction going on in the hotel (they are replacing balcony decks and railings and air conditioners) and next door to it (they are rebuilding the lifeguard tower). We didn't find either project to be excessively noisy, in fact many rooms were closed so the hotel was quieter than it might have been and the flow on the boardwalk was interrupted so it was quieter as well. This hotel was somewhat removed from the \"party\" section of the beach which was great for our family, we only had to walk out our the secure hotel gate and a few feet down the boardwalk to reach the stairs to the beach. The room was very clean, the bathroom somewhat dated but large and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was great as well and they do now offer cream cheese with the bagels. The building is of wood construction so there is some sound transference, we could hear water running and loud discussions if they took place in the bathroom. Most of noise we heard was created by incredibly rude people who felt that having loud discussions in the hallway or letting their kids play soccer there was perfectly acceptable! They rank right up there with the ones who bypassed the handy outdoor shower and went straight into the pool or their rooms, sand and all. The pool was nicely warm and cleaned regularly. There are lots of restaruants nearby, our favorites were Taylor's (right next door) and Joe's Crab Shack (a few doors down). It was easy to drive to the attractions we wanted to see, Sea World was about a 10 minute drive away. Our view was overlooking a very old motel, however we could see the ocean and it was quiet. Our only issue with this hotel is that although it is a totally non-smoking hotel, they allow people to smoke on the balcony with the door closed. As a result we were treated to flicked ashes and the smell of cigarettes on several occasions.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "helen118", "ReviewID": "UR3322360", "Content": "I have have just left the hotel less than 24 hours ago and what a great place to stay.

The outside heated pool great also. Shops across the road are good. Try Rharps. The two best bits advice I can give is eat at a great place on the broadwalk called the greenflash. JUst out of this world fish dinners. View great staff great. Just a brillent place. Also Seaworld. Be warned it is $7.00 to park then $51.00 each to get in.

So in addition to the other noise, we were awakened to workers actually standing outside our window yelling at the porch above. We had to leave the room the afternoon before because it was so noisy. Even if they finish construction on the hotel itself, the construction next door should take awhile. We reasonably requested a different room. We were just told that we couldn't be moved...there was no attempt at accommodation. They told us\"well it doesn't start until 8:00\". The \"view\" out the window was certainly the beach, if you could look past the construction workers, the wall, and the homeless. Even if no one was there, if you open the curtains to look out...everyone is staring back at you. I advise a different hotel, I didn't even recognize the place some people were describing, but if you book....check about the construction and get a second or third floor room.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay on the beach\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2993772", "Content": "We spent 12/25 to /1/2/05 at this hotel.

First, this Holiday Inn is possibly in one of the worst locations that one could possibly be in. If you're not familiar to this area and even if you are, please stay away from this hotel and take the extra time and head east on I-635 to a more decent and safer hotel. Second, the rooms for this hotel are no better than a MOTEL that you see on the side of road/ highway ( I would say more but I'm trying to make this family friendly). From walking through the lobby, hallways, even in the room there's a lingering smoke/ dirty/ musky smell. Also, throughout the night since the walls for the room we were staying in were so thin, we heard our neighbors TV throughout the entire night as well as everyone walking through the halls. So for this hotel to be rated a 3 star hotel it is very misleading. Third, and most importantly, was security. Of course because of this area, the first question I asked the employee at the front desk before we checked in was how is security in and around the hotel. The lady at the lobby guranteed me that nothing would happen because there is security in the parking lot 24 hours with multiple officers. Needless to say my truck was stolen from the front of the hotel. There was not multiples but only 1 security guard that works through the night and they leave around 4am. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy because it was just a horrible experience.

The front desk staff is composed of several employees that aren't the nicest people in the world, but they get the job done. The woman working at the concierge, however, was very sweet and helpful. There is a large touch screen board when you walk in, and it provides information and directions regarding shops, restaurants, and popular attractions. This was a nice feature. The rooms are nice, what you would expect with a Holiday Inn Select. Although I didn't have a chance to go swimming, the indoor/outdoor pool is really neat, and the jacuzzi is pretty roomy. The fitness center has 4 treadmills along with other exercise machines. It was a good collection for the hotel, I wasn't expecting the exercise facility to be that nice. There is a decent restaurant and bar right off the hotel lobby. They have a continental breakfast or a buffet, both are availible. The buffet isn't that extensive, but it serves its purpose. The men working at the restaurant don't speak the best English, and they seem to make everything more complicated than it should be, but they were hard workers. Something that really impressed me was the fact that we called the restaurant and asked them to stay open for our team to come eat after we finished late. They stayed open an extra 45 minutes for us to eat, and that was great customer service. The food tasted good, and not one person in our group complained about the quality of their food. So the other reviews you may read about the food, just remember: there are picky people out there who will find something wrong with everything. Considering everyone in a group of 20 people enjoyed the food, I'd say it it's pretty quality.

Nothing that new carpets and wallpaper wouldn't sort out - at least these are not the areas you sleep in after all, but all the detail fixtures and fittings like signs, lamp fittings and door handles all look old and worn out. Likewise the elevators felt really old and decrepit - and noisy - anyone allocated a room on the top floor near the elevators would no doubt have to put up with the noise from the machinery. Once in the rooms however, it gets a lot better. My bathroom at least was refurbished with new tiles and sanitaryware, but it lost marks for a toilet cistern that kept on topping itself up every half an hour (irritating when you were trying to get to sleep!). The rooms were palatial, the beds comfortable and the linen was clean and fresh. Another bit of tattiness comes from the old and noisy air conditioning/heating units by the windows. They really could do with some replacement. Personally, I found the restaurant food OK, but a bit ordinary, so I followed the usual pattern when it came to eating out once I had my bearings of the area, there was a large strip of restaurants in nearby Irving (about 10 minutes along I-635W) that I ended up going to - don't read too much into the claim that it is in the \"Galleria Area\" - it is in fact 6 miles along the pretty hare 'em scare 'em freeway. As others have mentioned, the breakfasts in the hotel are excellent and good value ($9.95), and there is a chef on-hand to cook omelets and scrambled eggs to order. All of the staff in the hotel were polite, eager to help and everything that I asked for was done expediently. As there were business conferences in the hotel pretty much every night I was there, there were always interesting people to strike up a conversation with in the bar in the evenings. Overall, I was pleased with this hotel. It isn't as bad as people on here have said, and it certainly doesn't warrant a one or two star rating. Bear in mind its location - I certainly wouldn't consider it if you don't have a car as there is no public transport nearby and there isn't very much in the way of restaurants or amenities within walking distance. The poor condition of the lobbys and the ordinaryness of the restaurant is the main reason why I'm giving it a 3 rating instead of 4. In short it's one of those hotels you wouldn't have any regrets about choosing, or being allocated by your employer, but given a free hand you would probably try somewhere else next time.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLook somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "railroader1", "ReviewID": "UR24645823", "Content": "I stayed there with a group for a meeting.

Booked a Saturday+Sunday night for $42 on priceline (it comes to about $52 per night after taxes). The hotel is right on the highway, but it's a little tricky to access by car (I ended up making a few u-turns to get to the place -- grab a GPS unit, or get a good set of maps before arriving). But by being right on the highway means that you can reach downtown by car in about 20 minutes in non-peak-hour traffic. A vehicle is a must. Public transit is non-existent, and it's awkward to access nearby restaurants without a car. Initial impressions of the hotel (from the lobby) are good. Lobby is fresh, clean, and must be newly renovated. There are (free) public internet access terminals, plus free in-room wi-fi. The atrium is modern and clean too, with the fitness centre, pool, and hot tub. The hotel hallways, though, could use some work. Drab 1980's carpeting, weak lighting, peeling paint meant that the walk to the room was rather depressing. The room itself was perfectly acceptable. The bed and pillows were comfortable. TV channel selection was present but limited. There were modern fixtures in the bathroom (that could use a fresh coat of paint). The cleaning staff are erratic, but they generally do a decent job. I don't know what people are talking about with a \"free breakfast\" (must be for conferences), but you can grab some bread from a Wal-Mart nearby. When they publish, you get a USA Today at the door of your room. If you get a room at the back, you usually don't have to worry about aircraft or freeway noises. All in all, don't be worried when you get this hotel on priceline. (Though, certainly do not pay rack rate for this hotel.)

I enjoyed it much more than the DFW Hyatt Regency I stayed at the week before on my way out of town. Tho not located exactly at the airport, the Holiday Inn Select is very much an airport hotel, only about 15 minutes away from DFW. Flight crews were coming and going at all hours. It's much more reasonably priced than the hotels right at the airport, and the restaurant was suprisingly delicious! My spinach salad was emmense, with fresh tasty ingredients, and only $6.95! The hotel building itself is from another era, huge, sprawling and mazelike, with a giant lobby, resplendant in it's faded 1980s decor, which the lower floor rooms open up directly into. Besides the restaurant the lobby includes a bar, a nice workout room, and an indoor/outdoor pool. The rooms themselves, however, are another story. I checked out 3 different rooms before finally settling on the least of the evils. The first room was on the second floor and tho musty, would have been acceptable- execpt the entire ceiling was vibrating like a boom box car with frightening metallic bangs and thuds! I went back to the front desk, and after thourough interrogation the clerk finally revealed that there just might be \"a little construction\" going on on the third floor. She reluctantly gave me a key to another room (first floor) and upon opening the door- GOOD LORD! smelt like the mummy's tomb! A whole new dimension of stinky than I've ever experience before! Back down to the front desk. A different clerk was at the desk and he quickly turned over a third key, this time on the forth floor. This room not only had a fine view of the pool and fitness room, but had only a vague mildew and tobacco smell, which reminded me of my youth and was oddly comforting. The rooms itself was quite clean, altho there was all kinds of garbage and room service debris in the hallways.

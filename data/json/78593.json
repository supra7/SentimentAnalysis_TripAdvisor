We had booked a pet room but with a tub but when we were shown our room it was a shower only room because they had moved us do to renovations on the courtyard. At first I was upset because I'd booked this months ago and felt they could have emailed told me the room I booked was unavailable but they went above and beyond to help do to the afore mentioned renovations they had to send someone to all the available rooms to find me a tub suite but they found one and we moved rooms with no hassle. The rooms a comfy tvs in both the living and bedrooms sinks in both living room and bedroom also. They had a full breakfast buffet with several types of muffins, bagels yogurts fruit and cereals to choose form as well as a made to order omelet station with sausage and bacon as well. The food was wonderful the drinks at the evening cocktail hour were very good as well as the chips and salsa cheeses and crackers.

Of course we expect all hotels to be expensive in Napa but this one had an open bar from 530 to 730 every evening. Not just wine and beer but anything you wanted! The breakfast was included as well and was really good. Made to order omelets were delish. Our room was a suite with a separate living area and a sink in the bedroom. It is right off of 29 so access to the main highway is super simple but this was also the cause for more noise near the morning. Being so close to the highway on the back side rooms you got a little more noise than normal so be prepared if you book those rooms. Some of the other reviews mentioned not getting a room near the atrium and I would agree. It is very noisy in there. The view from the outside rooms was nicer. The hotel staff are helpful almost to a fault. They spend so much time with each person that it can take a while to get checked in. A little patience goes a long was since it may be you there booking your tour for a discounted price! It is within walking distance to downtown Napa but it is a good walk. Don't let them say it is just down the road. But the neighborhood is good and we were not nervous at all walking back around 10pm after dinner.

For a hotel at this price (and 50,000 points per night for HHonors members), this type of noise should not be an issue.

In the front room, you can hear doors slamming and people walking up and down the walkway at nearly all hours of the day and night.

To keep your breakfast from becoming too cold, sit away from the doors, where people (seemingly oblivious) create an endless trail of foot traffic as they cut through the courtyard, holding doors open, instead of walking around through the hallways. Breakfast consist of eggs anyway you choose, pre-frozen potatoes warmed on a griddle, limp bacon, sausage links, plenty of hot pancakes, various assortment of breads and cereals, coffee and juices. The ladies preparing the food are very friendly and accommodating, so bring a few dollars for their tip basket, if you are so inclined. When we arrived, the hotel has just gone into \"heat mode\" and we heard the front clerk tell another patron that it would take an hour or more to have the rooms heat up. Our room, on the back side had a sliding glass door open up to a parking lot overlooking the highway 29 entrance ramp. Noise was very loud until after 8 pm. We attempted to request another room but the front desk was unwilling to help. The thermostat only controlled the amount of heat in the room, and despite highway noise, each night we had to open the sliding glass door for ventilation.

Great omlete station and great choices to pick from And parking was free which is always a great feature to have CONS: i though the hotek was nice....nothing too over the top. I though the price of $350 a night was excessive. We actually used our hilton points to reserve the room and it was almost 50,000 hilton points to stay. overall, i though it was a little much for the room and hotel accomodations. also, wifi was an additional cost Overall...greta stay, hotel was good but pricey, and location was perfect.

We stayed at the Embassy Suites Napa a few years ago, and decided to return due to having to use up airline points. We can't fault the staff as the front desk were efficient and helpful as were the breakfast attendants. However, the hotel room sure could use a major update. The decor is outdated, the sofa hasn't got much support, the shower and toilet are clean but need to be updated. Worse were the floppy bed pillows which frankly did not smell clean. Also the bathroom has just two tiny hooks attached to the door. There were no towel racks anywhere! They only provide a tiny hutch to place the clean, folded towels. Where do they expect the guests to do with them once they use them?? They could have attached some racks on the shower walls against the opposite side of the shower like many chain hotels do. It is very impractical and quite irritating to not have anything but those two itty bitty hooks. Speaking of the bathroom door it's weird. It's not a regular door but a swinging sort of door though it's complete. It's not appropriate. Thus, there is no lock on the door since it's in two pieces. Hopefully whomever you share the room with will not open the door on you accidentally. In addition, the rooms have very little insulation so one can hear the neighbors' noises from talking to slamming of their doors. The rooms we've had on both visits face the pool where the walkway to the rooms are wooden so when the guests walk and drag luggage on it the noise is quite apparent in the rooms. The windows facing the front of the hotel/street are thin and should really be replaced as the noise can be heard in the room. In short, this is a well-located hotel for the wine country and beyond, but it appears that the hotel management haven't made all that many updates over the years.

It was basically the same as the one our friends were in, except for details such as artwork on the walls, etc. However, the management did leave a bottle of wine for us, which was quite nice. I would agree with the other reviews that you can hear noises from other rooms, such as water, etc., but it really didn't bother us much. The only real noise disturbance was from people that were loading their car and leaving at 5:30 am, outside our window. Nothing to be done about that. The room itself and the bed was extremely comfortable. We appreciated having 2 sinks-his and hers. As we were with friends on this trip, it was nice to have the living room area to meet and relax in. The breakfasts were very good as was the afternoon reception. My only comment would be that it would have been nice to have had some changes in the breakfast menu after a day or two. It was exactly the same all 4 days-although it was very good! There is a business center available to print off boarding passes and such for your trip home if needed. The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants for dinner. We walked into Napa for dinner twice, as it was only about a 20 minute walk. The staff also was helpful in helping us arrange to have our wine shipped home-they work with a company close by, so we were able to leave our items at the front desk, and they arranged to have them packed and shipped.

I chose this property for a comfortable home-base while visiting Napa, Yountsville and SF with my mother and 11 year old daughter. It appealed to me because of the made-to-order breakfasts (saving meal costs), the location (near CA hwy 1), the 2 pools (1 indoor and 1 outdoor), and suite (2 room) accomodations. Positive reviews on TripAdvisor and other sites encouraged me to choose this hotel over similarly priced Napa locations. Upon arrival we were impressed with the exterior of the hotel and its convenient location to the highway. I went inside to check-in and found approximately 10 people standing around the check-in desk, with no clear line to be served. A very simple solution would be a single line and then have the reservations agents say ''Next please\", but that seemed to be something they didn't believe in at this hotel. Eventually (about a 20 minute wait...) I went up to check-in and when the agent found out I'd booked through Hotwire his smile turned to a frown and he said \"Oh... you booked through Hotwire.\" I asked if this was a problem and he said 'No', however the service with a smile was now gone! I was given a 2nd floor room (257) facing the indoor atrium (very pretty with tiled floors and high ceilings), but with the bedroom facing the highway at the back of the property. The room was clean enough, but the floors hadn't been vacuumed and I found several 'bits' upon arrival. The thermostat in the room was tough to find. Hidden behind the bathroom doors, which are actually a normal sized door cut down the middle to act as a French door. Very weird. The in room bar set-up was nice, as it had a large fridge, that wasn't a stocked honor bar so we could buy soda at the market and put it in our room versus out of the machines in the hotel. A small microwave and sink were there too. The room actually had 3 sinks... one in the bedroom, one in the bath and at the bar. The coffee maker in the room is only for 1 cup at a time, using proprietary 'pods'. FYI: if you bring your own coffee you can't make it in the provided maker. The king bed was comfortable enough, but the noise from the highway was awful as was the morning breakfast prep noise. The clanging of plates echoed through the atrium and into our room. Between the two noises, my whole family was up and ready to start our day by 6am each day, but this was NOT what we wanted! We also had one night with someone above us who apparently needed to catch an early flight. The stomping back and forth was just another fun addition to the already noisy room! NOTE: if you choose to stay at this hotel, be sure you ask for a 3rd floor room at the front of the property, preferably at the south end with the outdoor pool outside your room. That would be the quietest I'm sure. The second night we came home from a day out (leaving at 7am and arriving back at 3:45pm) to find our room had not been cleaned. We called the front desk to be told by the desk clerk \"Our maids work until 4:30pm and since it's not 4:30pm, they may not have gotten there yet.\" We were 5 doors down from the maid's office. I'd seen the carts parked there both in the morning and upon returning, so I decided to go have a face-to-face with the front desk. The front end was busy with check-ins (4pm) when I arrived. Approximately 30 people waiting to be checked in by 2 people; despite having 4 check-in terminals at the front desk. One desk attendant, David, was very nice, but also very slow. The other attendants, while almost rude, got things moving. Eventually I spoke with David and asked him \"When should we expect our room will be clean?\" He immediately called the maid's office to get it done. He also re-checked our reservation, which was lucky for me as he told me our keys wouldn't work the next day due to my reservations through Hotwire being made in two transactions on the same day, instead of one. He re-keyed our electronic keys and saved me another day of standing in line for poor service! The 2nd and 3rd nights were equally as noisy, and never was the room vacuumed. We did receive clean towels and toiletries, but that was it. No effort was made to step-up the service or offer something to make things right, such as a day of *free internet, which otherwise is $10 per 24-hr period, unless you use one of 2 computers in the 24 hr business office. The made-to-order breakfasts did save us money and were tasty, plentiful and fresh. Muffins, toast, fresh fruit, cereals (hot and cold), juices, coffee/tea and milk were all available immediately, or you could stand in line (not if you were early - before 7:45am) for an omelet, homefries, sausage, bacon and pancakes. You could eat in the atrium or out in the beautiful courtyard. The Happy Hour 5-7:30pm each eve, offered free beer, wine, soda, and well drinks, as well as Chex-mix, veggies with dip, tortilla chips and salsa, and popcorn. It was fun and a good snack to either enjoy downstairs or in your room. It seemed to have no limit. The indoor pool was nice with a large spa and sauna available. The outdoor pool was intimately sized and took up one of the outdoor courtyards. No fitness center, a small business center (2 computers, wired access for your laptops, 2 printers, 1 fax/copier), and a small, unmanned 'store' for toiletries, snacks and gifts. The Grille 29 is an on-site eatery/bar that offered general pub fare for the adults, some kid fare (PBJ for $5), and room service for a 21.5% service fee plus a $5 delivery charge added to your food tab, plus tax! We didn't eat there, but I believe the morning breakfast line-up is probably a good indicator of a mediocre Napa offering from the Grille. Beautiful courtyard with two sets of swans: black and white helped make this property a visually enticing one, however the incredible lack of sound-proofing of the room, the lack of concern to fairly basic lodging issues by the front-desk staff, a crabby omelet maker (yes, we got her too...), NO FREE INTERNET in the rooms or public areas and concerns over safety of the hotel (apartments across the street, field on side and highway at back of triangular-shaped property with no security on staff), would lead me to not recommend this hotel to anyone. A better similarly priced Napa property would be the Napa River Inn in downtown Napa. It has free parking and wireless internet, as well as a free breakfast. The location on the river would be infinitely quieter too!

We had other friends staying at the meritage but it was 20min south of downtown napa and the wineries; it was facing an industrial park and expensive. If spending time at wineries or downtown then location is key -especially if using taxis/limos.

The hotel will pack and ship your wine to any state using 3rd party shipper and was less expensive to ship than wineries; plus some winery shippers could not ship to all states. Fun tip: we arrived at 2pm on first day, then taxi to downtown to purchase $20 tasting card next to visitor center and walked to 4 wineries before 5pm closing times and then stayed for thurs night's festival. 2nd day - limo to 5 wineries; highly recommend - grgich, *cakebread, *nickel, *robert synskey, chandone (*reserv required).

Pros: excellent location to HWY 29 which is the main road through Napa, the continental breakfast was laid out like that at Seaside, a little all over but there was better seating and people could maneuver better to different food/drink stations. The omelet was delectable; the courtyard is really a site to see. My mom was taken in by it and our room overlooked it. Again, the room was spacious and clean and had a refrigerator. The staff was very friendly. Cons: the sofa was a rock! I really like relaxing and watching TV but I found it most undesirable and my mom was already in bed where the second TV was. The bathroom could use an extra hook for hanging a towel. No bellman EVER. Again, we are not in need of someone to drag our luggage to the room but opening a door would really be appreciated and is always a welcoming sign to guests staying at any hotel.

This year the rooms have changed their decor to different levels from the standard, romantic and executive, although the room layout is the same, the decorations differ. The rooms are very clean. We made the mistake to accept a low level floor and we changed due to the person above us walking constantly and making noise all night long (don't know what was wrong).

Front desk instructed us to pack our luggage and leave them by the door inside the room for housekeeping to transfer them to our new room once it was available. Well, after our tour we asked for the key to our new room and the luggage was already inside. Problem solved! We love the location because it is close to the highway, Downtown Napa and Lucky grocery stores. This time of the year is off season for wine country so the price was reasonable. The staff is always helpful. Front desk staff Dave was always helping us with anything we needed and recommending things to do. We had the best time in Napa and our stay was very relaxing!

The hotel is a sprawling complex with beautifully landscaped inner courtyards and grounds, and they even have a goose pond. Mature landscaping gives a lush look to the exterior of the property. There is ample free outdoor parking. The hotel feels old and appears to have been only partially renovated. The bedding is in great shape, but the furniture looks a little worn and outdated. The rooms have the feel of a country inn, with charming bedding and decor. The rooms actually are suites, with a separate sitting area with a large sofa, chair, dining table, television, and a nice wet bar with a mini refrigerator, microwave, sink and coffee maker. The bathroom felt tiny and had pocket doors to make the space feel bigger. The bedroom portion of the suite had a new flat screen t.v. and plenty of drawer space.

The bedrooms are positioned toward the parking lot, which is a hedge away from a very busy highway (see photos).

The front desk staff was less than pleasant as well. Be prepared to walk and walk and walk to your room. Since this hotel is spread out over several buildings, you may have to walk outside to get between your room and the front desk, parking lot or restaurant (not fun during inclement weather).

I have trouble sleeping when it is warm, and I have spent several unpleasant nights at this hotel, just waiting for the air to come back on at 8 am. It is ridiculous.

Last year we had a problem with the air conditioner in our room that never got remedied, but did get a box fan that helped a little bit. This year, same problem. Many people in our group complained about the a/c...the lowest setting you can put it on is 65, but in reality the thermostats are just decoration, and do nothing to cool the room. Finally we were told that they actually turn off the air conditioners at nine o'clock at night b/c some people get too cold. That's about the lamest thing I've ever heard. Obviously they turn off the a/c's to save money. My thought on that is if they can't afford to run the equipment, they shouldn't be offering the service. Interestingly, during our stay, they did go out and purchase more box fans for the \"hot\" customers (they ran out before...which speaks volumes for the situation).

Overall the hotel matches out to the prior reviews, and was a pleasant stay. This hotel is a good example of a unique item found in the Embassy Suites chain that I have not run into elsewhere. It appears to have been single\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartments converted into a hotel. (Arizona has several Embassies like this) This has some good & bad points, the good is the grounds as noted, but the room layout is rather strange with a full sink in the bedroom with a full bathroom right outside the bedroom. And overall I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found this type to always be in average shape with some parts really needing updating. Furnishings were in good condition, but slightly dated and we have the brown shutter room so we got the one old, one new TV. And we had the strange dated bar/kitchen. Check in on a Saturday during the summer, expect delays getting your room as this place is busy. (Check in itself was quick) And get to breakfast early, it gets crowded by 9 AM but the staff in the kitchen is one of the fastest short order kitchens I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. We had a room facing one of the parking lots so noise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem, and overall the guests were pretty quiet when using the many outside areas for relaxing. But to get around the area & to get to dinner, it was great. For dinner, highly suggest Julia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen at COPIA, we got a last minute table easily and it was much more of a local\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place without the HWY 29 crowd driving up the prices & the noise.

The grounds are nice, but not spectacular. The small pond, frequently patroled by live-in black and white swans, is a nice feature. The pool is small and crowded. The atrium appears circa 1975, with outdated carpet and furnishings. Same with the rooms. The living room furniture must've come from the rent-to-own-collection - similar to what one may see in a \"Roseanne\" rerun or a trailor park in Arkansas. We were not impressed. The room felt dark, musty, and cold. The breakfasts were good - we really enjoyed the made-to-order omelettes and french toast. The afternoon snacks and wine were pretty nasty - not what you'd expect for $300/night close to wine country. More of what you'd expect on a red eye flight. The wine wasn't really drinkable. The customer service was laughable. The front desk is staffed with teenagers - way too cool for school.

After reading the reviews here I thought it would be better than the average Embassy Suites--it is not! The hotel's web site says all suites are full renovated. Well I guess that depends on what you call fully renovated. By looking at the exterior of the rooms from the balcony it appears that there are two distinct room sets at this location. The rooms that had dark wood shutters fronting the balconies appeared to have LCD tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the front living space besides a rather 3rd rate lcd tv in the bedrooms. The rooms that had beige shutters had lcd tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the bedrooms but older crt models in the living space. As for my room it did have what appeared to be a newer couch, and chairs but the rest of place looked run down. The vanity had a big crack running through it. The kitchen (or whatever you want to call it) had a 1990's vintage microwave and mini frig. None of the phones in the room worked. Aside from the conditon of the interior of the room we had one other issue: The front door of the first suite we were given had an almost 1 \" gap between the door and door frame at the bottom of the door. Seeing as the front door was an exterior (picture old 1960's Holiday Inn style) door --this is not good. Besides letting in light just about any bug you could name could have come in the room and this is exactly what happened. We noticed this and were given another suite--which I noticed was only slighly better with a 1/4\" gap at the bottom of the door. If you need to do any work forget it unless your laptop battery is fully charged. There were no desks, just a table in the front room, but with no available plugs to use at the table.

As I drove up to the hotel, it didn't seem that nice. The location is right off the freeway, and I've seen Embassy Suites with better exteriors. I was really surprised when I stepped inside. It seems like a different world! It got better as I walked to the atrium and the conference area. The outdoor pond and watermill had a lovely ambiance and relaxing sound. The conference rooms were nice and the staff members were friendly. I was not wowed by my room. I was in the wing closest to the freeway, on the ground floor. It was dark and gloomy in the room, even though we opened the shades. The furniture/beds were nice enough, with a French country-type style, but not as nice as other properties. It was nice to have a vanity outside of the bathroom so we could get ready faster - but it was kind of weird having it right next to the TV. The beds themselves were comfy enough - but anything would have worked for me after supervising a group of college students at the conference. I only had 2 negative comments: When I walked by the ponds (where the geese & ducks were), there was a terrible sewage-type smell, which disappeared once you went into the buildings. The other bad thing was a loud security alarm (not sure where it was coming from) going off for more than an hour. I wasn't sure if it was on the property or across the street. I just wished someone would have found it earlier to turn it off! I guess this showed how thin the walls were - I could also hear street traffic throughout the night.

Small water features and animals were present. The room was simply a typical Embassy Suites room. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Nothing worse than a typical Embassy Suites...but nothing better either. The bed was okay. We both didn't sleep so great on it. But it wasn't a horrible bed. Breakfast was simply a zoo! We had to wait in line for approximately 20-25 minutes, and then there were absolutely no tables available, so we had to take it up to the room, then return for juice. Breakfast was okay...about on par with Denny's calibar food. Not horrible, but certainly not gourmet. Again...typical Embassy Suites. Would I return to this hotel...probably!

We watched the Steeler game last Monday in the bar, on really comfy couches. Almost as good as home!! What a mess the Monday night game was!! We are from Pittsburgh so guess why we picked CA for a few days?? The managers reception is nice, food got a little boring but is free(well, included in your price). Mike, who is a bartender for the 2 hours while you are there is really nice. We tipped him well and he kept the wine and drinks flowing!! You can sit inside in the Atrium but since we are from the North we enjoyed sitting outside. The did not have the Chimneas lit ,but I bet if we would of asked the would have!! We did sit at the fire, as I said above. David at the front desk was very helpful, as seen in above reviews. He helped us plan a few days and we got in all that we wanted to see. It was crazy but this was a sightseeing vacation not our usual beach vacation. What I really liked was David remembered us and what we did for the day. What a personal touch!! That made us feel special. When can you say that about a hotel?? He was great. They have comment cards and we filled one out for both Mike and Dave, I hope they got them. Dave, if you are reading this after we told you about this web site please accept our thanks. We were told to go to Bogeta Bay by Mike. What a beautiful drive through wine country.

Ideal if you are going with a group of friends having to share accommodations, or bringing a child. I was blown away by the swans, flower gardens, indoor/outdoor pools, huge bar, restaurant, lots of meeting space. Plus, we recieved a rennovated room which meant all up to date furnishings (pretty mod) and flat screen. Because I am a Hilton Honors Gold, they gave us a bottle of good wine. Plus, there were extra little perks like actual coffee beans and grinder! This is an idea I can't believe more hotels dont use! I am a coffee snob, so it was wonderful. Other little amenities were shoe shine kit, bath salts, teas, hot chocolate, popcorn, it was very nice. And, we brought our 2 year old, so he actually got our King bedroom and used the sleeper sofa, which wasn't a good idea. Pretty uncomfortable and hard on the back.

We were on the first floor, a major mistake on our part, but we were with two other couples and in the midst of fun, so who cared, right? Well, at about 6 a.m. our first morning there, we cared, A LOT! As did our friends who had the same experiences in their rooms. The people above us tromped back and forth, rather loudly, for two hours. Just as you fell back to sleep, the creaking floorboard above our bed would scare the heck out of you and set you upright! And everytime they flushed or washed or showered, it sounded like a waterfall was coming down in us. Not nice. After they left, we were calmed by the humming of the maid vacuuming their room! HAHAHAHA This happened both mornings, but it was relatively minor all things considered. But seriously, aside from the two hours in the mornings and the hour or so at night when the elephants above us were active, the hotel was great. The \"free\" cooked to order breakfast was amazingly good with coffee, juices, tea, bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. All for the taking. We took it all back to our room rather than sit in the atrium and enjoyed our \"free\" USA Today paper in private. In the evening, the \"free\" wine, beer, sodas and mixed drinks were an even greater plus, although more booze after a day of wine-tasting was a bit tough and honestly, I could not see getting the best of the Embassy Suites on that deal!! The room was pretty clean and I am a clean freak. The only other complaints, aside from the herd of elephants, was the fact that the two TV remotes did not work and the shower was a light mist. If you are into people spitting on you, then you will be a happy camper. But for what we paid, I was quite happy! Easy to get to, right off the 29 freeway (we backed up to it but heard very lttle to no noise) and close to both St Helena Hwy (the 29) and the Silverado Trail.

I travel quite a bit with work and stay at 4 and 5 star properties, so I am picky. I would give this property a solid 3.5 almost a 4. Quiet, clean, great atmosphere and close to downtown Napa and central to visiting alot of the wineries. Speaking of wineries: We suggest going to: Artesa (wines so so, but the view is the best in Napa), Domain Carnaros( we joined their wine club-great terrace where you overlook Carneros region, sipping champagne and having a cheese tray), Sequoia Grove (small boutique, awesome wines and a warm/fuzzy feel, and Cakebread (their wines-need I say more. Their Tour was great, you got to keep you glass, sample 5 wines and a tour for 10.00 a person). Did a private tour and tasting at Seduction Winery-(small boutique feel and just loved it), Monticello was nice and small feel. Did not care for: Hall or St Supery. We did about 10 wineries in 4 days. I highly reccommend not going to the Mondavi's/Beringers..think small boutique and you will enjoy it more. I also reccommend getting the COPIA passport for 5.00 on line. We had tons of two for one tasting coupons which my Husband was thrilled with. That passport saved us over 100.00! We also went to Muir Woods and San Fran for lunch on Memorial Day-broke up all the wine were consuming. We had a convertible so we enjoyed driving around the. I am a huge tripadvisor fan, and so far the reviews of this hotel are spot on. Enjoy your trip, we can't wait to go back and get our wine in the mail. Cheers!

Honestly, I was torn between staying here and the new, Meritage Resort and Spa (see below). I decided we would stay here based on its location to the wineries, as well as, our past experience with the Embassy Suites Hotel chain. We stayed using the government rate (like the last reviewer) which apparently was a bad decision. This is the first property where you are banished to the corner (down the hallway, at the end, on the bottom floor with a view of a wall and the parking lot/street) just because you booked with a discounted rate plan; there were plenty of other rooms available as the hotel was not full. We were then offered to upgarde to an \"executive suite\" for an upcharge($30.00), which we agreed to do with the check-in person. When she went to book it, she then wanted to charge us an extra $150.00 DOLLARS, way more than what we had agreed upon. After a short discussion, the manager agreed to the original agreed upon price, BUYER BEWARE. When we got to our room, the room smelled like must from old smoke. I know they just finished refurbishing this hotel but they can't get the old \"smoke\" smell out; we propped the door wide open while we got ready for dinner. If you want to go to the jacuzzi, be sure to go before 10:00 pm, as they shut off the power after that and turn down the lights. The drinks in the evening were good and the staff was friendly. For the morning breakfast, they give you a coupon to hand in at the counter; I have never had to do this before at this chain, which led me to believe that you are only entitled to one trip through the line for the hot foods, so, get it the first time. The property is nice and the pond and water wheel are a nice addition. It is unfortunate that they allow smoking at the outside tables (inside the courtyard area) as it really takes away from the whole atmosphere. We also saw the baby ducks (27 of them) and they were a nice addition to the proterty. I would think twice before staying here again, even if you do get a cheap rate for your room. SPA TERRA AT MERITAGE RESORT: This place is beautiful even if it is in a coporate park setting, but the spa staff is very inexperienced and the the couples room is quite stark, not quite the intimate setting I was expecting. They start you with a wait (25 minutes) in the quiet room where you wait to be greeted for your massage. Our masage was supposed to start at 3:40 but it really started at 3:50 by the time the staff arrived to greet us, and then you walk to the room and get comfy before they start. It was not worth the $250.00 dollars it cost for the 40 minute (basic) massage. They also have a wine cave across from the spa where you can tatse for a price; 15.00 for samples or they sell it by the glass. DINNER at DON GIOVIANI'S: Dinner here was exceptional and very reasonable for what most dinners would cost in the Napa Valley. We had the soup, the calamari and shrimp appetizer, and the ravioli, all of which were great. The dessert that was served next to us looked wonderful and the pizza looked tasty as well. If you love the orange creamsicle (I'm dating myself), they have a drink here that tastes just like it, Yum-O. The next day we went upvalley to go wine tasting, which we went to Coppola and Domaine Chandon for champagne. Thanks to Lisa, from the wine cave, we tatsed at Coppola for free; there is usually a charge for tasting. The grounds are beautiful but the name is now Rubicon. Domaine Chandon, I think, is one of the best places for tours and tasting. The tasting room is undergoing some sort of renovation, so all tasting is done outside on the patio; if the weather is inclimate, you will need to bring a coat.

We were visiting Napa and then on our way to San Francisco. We arrived around midnight. The lobby was very pretty and grand looking. It was a large room with a fireplace and lots of chairs, internet access, a kiosk to print out airplane tickets, water and coffee and the front desk. Checking in was a breeze. The front desk person was very nice. The lobby is indoors but the hallways to the rooms are outdoors. They have a cover so you wouldn't get rained on. I have kind of made it a rule not to stay anywhere with outside hallways because in my experience, they are usually skanky and shady places but I took a chance because this place looked nice and was a GREAT price to stay in Napa. We took the elevator to the 2nd floor and it was confusing signage to find our room. The room was awesome. It was beautiful and very big. There was a living room and bar when you walked in. It was very homey. A couch, a tv, chairs, a kitchen table, a coffee table, and the bar with stools. There are lots of books about the local wineries, how much tastings are, restaurants, things to do, etc. The bathroom was also very nice (the usual marble with the shower and curved shower curtain for more room). The doors were weird though. It was two little skinny doors that closed together (but opened separately) and one was on a hinge so the doors couldn't stay open. They automatically closed. No big deal, just weird and annoying. The bedroom had a sink and mirror (convenient to get make up on when someone is in the bathroom). There was a king bed and a TV and end tables. The bed was VERY comfortable and there were sound machine alarm clocks that could wake you up by your MP3 player or sounds (like the ocean, the rain, etc) or the alarm noise or radio. I believe the bedroom was facing the highway ramp but I didn't not hear anything from the highway at all. The room was very quiet. I did not hear anyone that night or the next day. The living room faced the courtyard which was really pretty. There was an outdoor pool, a pond with swans and tables and chairs, a gazebo and a little mill. The next morning we went to the free deluxe hot breakfast that was included. I was so impressed. It was in a nice restaurant part and there was lots of drinks (juices, coffee, milk, water, etc), cold food (cereal, fruit, danishes, bagels, bread, etc), a omelet making station (lots of options, made to order, bacon, sausage, potatoes), pancakes, waffles. Maybe more but I didn't notice. The omelet was very good. The potatoes weren't that great but they were free so who cares? It was a very good breakfast for free. It was a good breakfast for money. It was the same thing you would get at any breakfast restaurant. I don't think you could go back for more omelets, bacon or sausage (though they probably wouldn't care) but the rest of the food was like a buffet. There was also an indoor pool and spa that looked nice. The free internet in the lobby was available when we arrived at midnight but checking out on a Friday morning around 11, there was basically a line for it. One guy would NOT get off even though people were waiting. I also heard the airline ticket kiosk thing was not working. Checkout was also easy. You can check out from your room or at the front desk and there weren't any people at the desk waiting. The front desk people were very polite giving us winery maps and two \"buy one, get one free\" tasting coupons at two wineries. Ask for those. Napa charges at almost every winery for tastings and it is between $5 and $30 (except fancy special reserve tastings). Most places were $10 for a 4 tastings. The hotel was in a good location. Right in downtown Napa and there are wineries everywhere though the bigger ones are probably 15 minutes away. TIP: GO TO THE NAPA VISITORS CENTER. There was a man there selling resort condos who gave us a tasting card for free tastings at like 10 wineries. He didn't even force a sales pitch. He asked how long we'd be there and if we had time to look at the condos, we'd get a $100 restaurant gift card for Napa OR San Fran. It actually seemed reasonable but we said we would only be there until 5 PM and that was it. No pressure at all from him. He was very nice. Plus, we got maps and recommendations for wineries and places to eat. It was well worth it. Napa is not as nice as Sonoma in my opinion. Much more built up (even in the wineries section). Not as much individual service at the tastings. Sonoma had all free tastings pretty much except reserve wines and most places gave us those for free too. They were a little friendlier in Sonoma. Sonoma was also much prettier and picturesque like you'd picture in the movies or on a postcard. Now, Napa was very nice but I'd head to Sonoma if you have the time. I am saying Napa but I mean Napa Valley (St Helena, Rutherford, etc). They are all next to each other. One place we did not like was V. Sattui Winery. They are one of the only free tasting places and it shows. It was SO crowded that they wouldn't even serve us. They have specific sections to be served (certain parts of the bar, they literally just ignore you. Literally. There were lots of angry people trying to talk to someone). When they do serve you, they are rushed and rude, they don't give you any time. There is barely room to move. On the bright side, they have good wine and they have a deli/market section with GREAT food. That is part of the reason they are so popular. The food is so good and there are tables to eat at outside. Go for the food, go elsewhere for tastings. In summation, the hotel was great. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNever again at Embassy Suites\u201d", "Author": "chicagogirl77", "ReviewID": "UR6908204", "Content": "My husband is a Hilton Diamond Honors member, so we were very excited to stay at the Embassy Suites in Napa.

After we checked in we were told to drive around to the back of the complex and find one of 3 entrances with awnings the get you into the building. There is absolutely no signage outside of the doors and it was difficult to find our room once we got inside (no signs with room numbers and arrows directing you). Once inside, the very dark room had a very strong mildew smell but after driving for 3 hours in the rain and struggling with luggage, finding the room, etc. I didn't have the energy to ask for and move to another room. The room was also warm and stuffy with no A/C to cool it off. We opened the window but then heard the very close highway noise.

The sheets and towels were the roughest and cheapest quality I've ever had in any hotel. The hair dryer is placed in a fancy black bag with a tied rope around it which sits high on a stand on the bathroom counter. At least on Sunday (when I got nosy and looked in the bag) I got to dry my hair. Saturday morning I received an in-room massage that my daughter had scheduled for me. She told me that she had pre-paid for it and that I should just pay the tip just in case it wasn't up to par. When we received our bill a charge ($90) for the massage had been added. I called the spa and the very nice lady said she'd call the front desk, take care of it and call me right back in which she did. I thought the $90 charge was odd since the massage therapist didn't have me sign anything for payment, meaning she already knew it was paid for.

We stayed with our two small children, one in a portacrib and one in the hideabed in the sitting area. I like the separate bedroom for the adults. We were there while they were remodeling but stayed in the back, it seemed at the time that the rooms at the front of the hotel were being remodeled, but there were lots of dumpsters around, furniture being moved in and out, etc. Didn't bother us during the stay but definitely noticed it when outside the hotel, coming and going. Sorry to see that we just missed a renovated room, it did seem a bit dated but clean and spacious enough. My biggest complaint is the indoor pool. The tile, while beautiful, stays very wet and very slippery. I had a vice grip on my two-year-old's hand the entire time he was out and he slipped on almost every step he took. My six-year-old, entering the pool area carefully with athletic shoes on, slipped and fell right before I said \"be very careful, the tile is slippery.\" Luckily he fell well and wasn't hurt but it is shocking to me that they haven't corrected this problem with better surfacing. Young, old and in-between could be seriously hurt and they could face lawsuits on a regular basis. This must be fixed. The breakfast, while free, reminded me of a cafeteria or dorm, it wasn't that great. But there were lots of choices and it was nice to serve ourselves and be done with breakfast quickly with two little kids ready to start their day and not sit still for long. The atrium is a nice setting for a quick bite with kids, a group of travellers, or for a business traveller. The hotel sits right on Highway 29 and in fact our room faced the back of the property and the highway, however, the noise wasn't bad. Just be aware of this if that view would bother you to be sure to upgrade to something with a different view. The price was right for us and we weren't there for the ambiance. I would not recommend this as a romantic hotel for couples travelling in wine country. There surely are more attractive options. From the outside it is a nice looking hotel, and the inner courtyard is quite pretty and the swans in the \"old mill\" area are fun to watch. The \"vibe\" however is not very interesting otherwise.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Padre Island, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfast, hotel just ok\u201d", "Author": "DLapeyre", "ReviewID": "UR5540416", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights on our vacation. Pulling into the hotel had to park way in the back because it was so full. Kind of seedy and had construction workers staring out some of the windows at us. We had so much wine and stuff in our car I did not feel secure at all and moved it as soon as I could get a space in the front of the hotel. When checking in discovered the front desk clerk was brand new and took awhile to check us in. The hotel had construction workers everywhere which made my 21 year daughter uncomfortable. Only one elevator working and it was always full of construction workers and materials and a huge mess. When we get to our room the key does not work. I have to go through the whole waiting 5 minutes on the elevator, etc and go back down to the font desk where the kid gets me new keys. When we finally get in to the room it was newly decorated and spacious. We use the toilet and it starts overflowing all over the floor for no reason. So we have to move to another room, back down to the front desk...new set of keys again. Rough start but now for the good stuff. Great breakfast served in the atrium. Grounds were nice, location was close to downtown Napa and easy to get to. But by far the best thing was the MASSAGES in room. I had booked online on the hotels website. Both my daughter and I thought the girls who did them were the best we have ever had. I had the Down Under which was alot of feet and calves, also neck and shoulder and my daughter had a deep tissue Swedish massage. I wish I could remember their names to refer by name. On our trip to California we first stayed at the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay and the Inn of the Spanish Garden in Santa Barbara which were both 5 star excellent hotels so compared to those this hotel was just OK but I would recommend if you are going to Napa and I would probably stay there again since the construction would be done.

I booked a little late, so there was not much else available - but because Embassy Suites has a fairly good reputation, I decided to try it. We were VERY disappointed. The only good thing I can say is that the lobby is nice and they had excellent customer service. The Manager was very apologetic and tried to make us comfortable. Our first room smelled very bad and did not have a good view - was on the ground floor. The smell was hard to describe - it was a musty/moldy/wet dog-that-had-tried-to-be-masked-by-cleaning-products-kind-of-smell. Very nasty. We asked to be moved, and were put into an upstairs room with an even worse view. This room smelled equally as bad, we finally gave up and opened up the door in the \"living room\" and the sliding glass door in the bedroom for a few hours to air it out. The \"suite\" was very small and dark and the bedroom side was located right next to the freeway. The bed, along with the rest of the furniture, was very hard and uncomfortable - we did not sleep well AT ALL. The room seemed fairly clean, but not the cleanest I've seen. The decor was very dated and worn. It was Motel-6 quality - which is fine if you booked at Motel-6 - not OK if you booked a $199/night \"Suite\". The cocktail hour was OK. They had a fairly well-stocked bar - I liked that I could order mixed drinks. The snacks consisted of a veggie tray, chips/salsa, olives and a cracker/cheese/meat tray. It was decent, but just the basics. The breakfast was OK. Everything, except for the omelets, were pre-made and kept under heating lights. The only omelet available was ham & cheese with a choice of onions, peppers and mushrooms. Bagels and toaster were available - that was nice. After the 1st night I used the computer in the lobby to book a room at the Park Hyatt in San Francisco (nothing else available in Napa area). Luckily, the Manager was very nice and let check-out after only one night, despite the 2 night minimum. He also reduced the price from $199 to $149. He was extremely nice and helpful - even gave us directions to San Francisco via the Golden Gate Bridge. As a side note - had a wonderful time in SF. The Park Hyatt was very nice, excellent staff and good location. Also, the city was practically empty for Memorial Weekend, which we very much enjoyed. They also had great rates at most of the nicest hotels there. We paid $179 for a very nice room with a beautiful view. The only downside is that parking was $40 plus tax. Although, had we booked earlier, and for more than one night, we could have gotten a better rate that included free parking.", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rescue, Ca.", "Title": "\u201cNot Perfect But Still a Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "TravelinCanuck", "ReviewID": "UR3685562", "Content": "My wife attended a medical conference here for several days and my 16 year old son and I tagged along with her for the stay.

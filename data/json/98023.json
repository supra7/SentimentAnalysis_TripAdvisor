We went for a walk around the grounds one evening and we were suprised by a man who came running at us yelling. We walked into the lobby thinking that we would be ok there but were amazed that he walked up to the front desk and told them \"I want to talk to them\" and was allowed to follow us down the corridor. He then said he needed money as his car had broken down 2 blocks away. It was obvious to everyone that we were trying to distance ourselves from him and a confrontation ensued. He finally left empty handed after we directed him back to the front desk, but who needs this on holiday? Later we went for another walk and there he was waiting in an old car for some other poor sod to walk in. He saw us and round two was on. We decided to forego any more walks. Why was he allowed to park in the grounds let alone follow us down the corridor? They advertised a continental breakfast but there was no breakfast except a couple of rolls of doubtful origin, and these were gone before we got to them.(they were not replaced) there was not even toast. Nothing. Even the fruit juce containers were empty and this was at 7am! The maintanace? Yes we had a fridge but it was in a death throw. It wheezed and gasped so much we had to turn it off at night. The bath was cracked and the crack was covered with sealer. We even had a cockroach wander by to keep us entertained. On the last morning I checked under the bed and was amused to find a large piece of wood under the centre of the bed supporting it. The place itself could be ok with some maintanace. But it does need security.

I was a bit dismayed when I originally arrived, as the lobby is locked and the neighborhood is airport/industrial, but the room was comfortable, I have wireless internet (my room is near the lobby), and there was even a very minimal breakfast.

I have stayed in spare rooms in bars in third world countries and hostels that made the movie of the same name look tame and this was one of my top 10 worst experiences. The rooms are horrible. The locks do not work (one is actually missing [the lock where you flip a long loop bolted to the doorframe over a ball on a rod affixed to the door itself was missing the loop]) on the front door (the peep hole did not work either) and the bathroom door does not close at all.

The mattress and box springs are soaked in some red substance (and I do mean soaked). The sheets, towels, washcloths, pillows and comforter are threadbare and stained. The furniture and electronics are from the 70s and broken (the tables sway if anything is set on them and the remote is missing batteries and a battery cover). The mirrors are chipped. The outlets will not hold plugs and shock you if you touch them. Most of the lamps and fixtures that do work do not have light bulbs and the ones that do have no covering. There are used condoms in the dresser drawers. The shower curtain is covered in mold. The bathroom walls and tub are covered with mold, mildew and that reddish brown stain. The toilet does not flush unless you hold down the handle the entire time. The knob to the sink has to be held on in order to use the water. There is no drain cover but there is a toothbrush lid in the drain. I had to purchase bedding, towels and cleaning supplies at 2 in the morning after driving 6 hours non stop in order to sleep. Lastly, there is no security (evidenced by the fact that my car was broken into in the parking lot and my GPS, iPod, digital compass, coat and iPod dock were stolen, the fact that on two separate occasions someone attempted to jimmy open my door while I was inside and I was followed by a gentleman whenever I left my room for ice or to go to my car).

The staff at the hotel was superfriendly always asking us how our stay was going and if there was anything they could do for us. My only complaint about the hotel would be the state of their pool, the pool was dirty when we checked it out on the first night with water bottles floating in the pool and wrappers all over the floor, furthermore there were no lounge chairs which was dissapointing as we wanted to lay out by the pool and get a tan.

The staff were mostly very friendly (especially Melissa who brought up room service and served me in the restaurant), the room was clean, and the bed comfortable. The pool area was great, and the wine servings generous :) I liked that the Light Rail was a block away. The restaurant food is quite good, especially the breakfast buffet. There were two negative things about my experience. First, I ended up adding a couple of nights to my original booking that had been done through my administrative assistant. The website showed those nights as $30 cheaper than what I was paying throughout the week; however, the employee handling my checkout insisted that the price was what had been agreed upon. I wasn't happy about that - I felt I should have been giving the going rate for the extra nights I ended up staying. Unfortunately, I was hurrying to catch a flight, and did not have time to speak with a manager. Whether or not the manager would have given me the going rate, I don't know. Perhaps! The second negative -and this is the one thing that would stop me from ever staying in this hotel again - is that the internet connection was lousy. I tried both wireless and not - web pages took ages to load, if they ever actually did. This made it impossible to work from my hotel in the evenings, and on the weekends, when I wanted to price car rentals and see what Phoenix had to offer, I just couldn't access pages I needed to access. Simple email was ok, however.

Briana, at the front desk, juggles many tasks with ease. I had arrived early in the day, and there was no room available. In between greeting me, checking out someone else, and answering the phone, she took my bags and placed them in a secured room so that I could go for a walk. When I got to my room, I need to setup up my computer and get to work for a presentation the next day. The desk chair was stuck in position and I could not raise it to work at the desk. Stephanie from housekeeping got on it right away and within minutes I had a new desk chair. Stephanie also insisted on helping me up to my room with my bags because I had returned with a cup of coffee, so did not have enough hands. When I needed a light bulb replaced, that also happened very quickly. This wasn't because they were bored, as the hotel was close to full. Besides a coffee pot in the room, in the morning there is free coffee in the lobby, and it was excellent. I did not eat in the hotel, but walked just a few blocks to a little mall that has a few casual restaurants (Thai, Italian, Mexican, Deli, and Starbucks). The only issue with the room was that the air conditioning/heat was loud, so I kept turning it on and off. It was comfortable enough as the temperature outside was only(!) about 85. The hotel is only a couple blocks from the Osborn/Central light rail stop. I took it from the airport, and got there from a free shuttle at the airport.

Our experience started upon arrival. My first contact was with the General Manager, Wendy Paler There was an issue at the time of check-in and by the time I had my vehicle unloaded and returned to the loby, the issue was resolved to my complete satisfaction. I was very comfortable that the training of this staff was customer satisfaction with a smile. I then met the Director of Sales, Darrell Surhigh. What a professional he is. Once he discovered that I was there for a convention, he knowing there would be several otghers of my organnizaion arriving over the next two (2) days, he asked me what they would expect. Darrell sounded very concerned and wanting to satisfy so I was very candid with him about the organization. As such, all of their requests were more than completed, up to and including the Hotel renting another shuttle vehicle to shuttle guests to and from the hotel from early morning to late evening hours. Now let me tell you about Stephanie, the Manager of housekeeping. What a fantastic lady. She was everywhere all the time and I never saw her without a smile. Her staff was second to none. We never returned to our room after it being cleaned and it not being as spotlesss as the day we arrived. The housekeepers are second to none The management staff deserve the highest praise possible. I did not meet one associate who did not speak perfect english even with a varienty of nationalities. I knew any questions or comments I had were understood and I was able to have open communications with each and every one of them. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. The serving table was always clean and orderly, the breakfast choice was very well presented. The food was hot (when required), and a very broad choice was present for selection. The eating tables were always clean and there were cloth napkins present with clean silverware at the seating locations. Brett (unknown if he is a manager or not) was alwas present and served the guests well. The dining room was set up well for evening meals and the menue had a wide selection on choices. We ate several dinners there and each meal was very well presented and the amount of food was beyond what either my wife or myself could complete.

It appears to be a formerly beat-up property that has been renovated and slapped a 'HI' sign on the door. It is not really in downtown - in fact it is 5 train stops away from the heart of downtown. On the bright side the hotel is not too far from major freeways and the airport. The parking lot is tiny - if you can't park there forget about it because you will never understand the directions given by front desk staff to and out of the shared parking lot with another hotel. The \"Business Center\" is a small room with 2 computers and no privacy which allows the gawkers to get their fill as they trundle to the elevators. No conference room or steakhouse is visible on the property. The restaurant flows out from the tiny lobby. Room service is advertised to run from 6 a.m. - 10 a.m. Don't believe there is any evidence of it on the four nights I was there. Before midnight of the first night I put out the breakfast order for 6:00 a.m. In the morning there was no knock on the door at 6:00 a.m. I waited 5 minutes and dialed room service. I got the front desk and requested my order to be sent up right away. By 6:20 there was no follow-up call from the front desk so I called down and was told the cook had arrived at 6:00 and was \"working on it.\" I told the front desk a tour bus was picking us up at 7:00. No action again. At 6:35 I called down again and asked when if ever the food was going to be ready. At 6:42 I was told my order was going to be ready at seven. Just one problem - the tour bus is going to be here at 7:00 I reminded him. I indicated my dissatisfaction and said if they were not capable of fulfilling my room service order they should have told me right away and I would have made alternate arrangements. I don't believe the staff have grasped the concept of customer service. All they could offer us was 2 complementary breakfast buffet tickets which we used on the last day there. It was fair at best. On most mornings the food would just sit there as there were very few customers. The owners either need to eliminate the restaurant and offer this property up as a no frills 2 star motel @$55 per night or seriously upgrade their facility and staff to get it to an $85 per night level. Not in the heart of downtown so not a lot of restaurants nearby - hey I miss Frisco - but for breakfast your best option is the Good Egg in the Park Plaza building on the way to the train and half a block down. In the same building is a great spot for lunch - hot or cold sandwiches called simply the Deli. To stock up on bottled water, etc. turn left out of the hotel and walk a block to Walgreens or two blocks to the right to get to Safeway. There are no safes in the room so the in-room literature advertises to leave your valuables at the front desk. When you get to the front desk you find there are no individual safety deposit boxes as you would expect but a communal hotel safe that the staffer was unable to open. After the fourth try I told her not to bother. The front desk staff are often absent from their posts, and not very knowledgeable about their city. The management staff are invisible. The only competent staff are the housekeeping staff who are actually friendly. I always tip for maid service or any ABCD (Above and Beyond the Call of Duty) service everywhere I stay so I was pleased with the cleanliness and somewhat larger standard room and the comfortable beds.

I bought a 3 day pass for $10.50 and could even use the city bus system to reach Camelback Mountain to hike. The hotel has recently been renovated and the decor is modern and sleek. My room was great with choices of firm and soft pillows, a small fridge, and coffee maker. The pool is right near the lobby and nice for the AZ heat. I was grateful for the business area were I was able to get online and print directions for walking, the light rail and city buses to sights nearby.

My wife and I travelled with four friends. The hotel was in a decent location; very close to downtown. However, other than a Walgreens, there is not much within walking distance. The hotel interior was very nice. The restaurant and bar area seemed like a nice place to hang out. However, there is no breakfast included here-one of my major complaints. They did offer a breakfast buffet for $8.50/person. But the Good Egg was a great breakfast location just 2 minutes away-where you could get a better bang for your breakfast buck. The other drawback was the parking situation. There is a small parking lot in front of the hotel-about 20 spaces. They also share a parking lot with the Radisson-which is a decent walk from the Holiday Inn. If you have luggage, you need to unload before you park your car The rooms are a comfortable size. We were in a room with 2 queen beds and felt a little cramped. There is a desk, small fridge, and small bathroom. Our friends stayed in a suite-which was a nice size. However, the suites only had one TV in one room. Our room did not have a microwave either. The beds were very comfortable and the room itself was quiet. We could not hear noise from other rooms or doors closing. The pool and hot tub were nice. They had towels available at the pool. There is a business center that we did not use. The free wifi worked well in our room. We reserved directly with the hotel and paid 92/night. I know this hotel sometimes charges 200 or more; it is not worth it for this much.

The hotel is about 15-20 minutes away and about a $25 cab ride. There is no shuttle from the airport. We booked two rooms. Check-in was smooth, and the front desk folks were friendly. We had to wait for one of the rooms to be cleaned because we wanted two close to each other, and one of the desk clerks offered some of our party some complimentary coffee drinks from the coffee bar in the lobby. That was a very kind gesture. Since we're Platinum Priority Club members, we also got nifty little welcome bags with water, fruit, and chocolates. The rooms were average to smallish in size, each with two double beds. Not much of a view, just the downtown Phoenix city-scape. There are no balconies. Nice flat-screen TVs in the room. When the TV across the room wasn't working, we called the front desk and someone from the staff was up almost immediately to correct the problem. The property seems to be just about done with renovations, so you may still encounter a few rough edges at present, but nothing that would put me off staying here. The bathrooms were clean and functional, although our room was out of tissues. The room across the hall seems to have AC that isn't really working that hard. The double beds were comfortable, if maybe a little small for grown-ups. Nice little business area downstairs with two PCs and a printer.

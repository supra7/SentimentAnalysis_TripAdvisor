I arrived at the hotel early and checked in. I noticed that the parking lot was empty and the hotel looked worn. As I walked to my room, all the bottom rooms were vacant and the doors were open. The carpets were ripped out and the furniture piled on top of each other. I figured they were remodeling. The trash can located by the ice machine was full of empty beer boxes and it made me wonder where are the cars for the people that made this kind of mess? My room was upstairs and looked clean. But there was trash in the parking lot and it seemed like a ghost town. My room was at the very end of the property and I felt unsafe. Especially if I was the only person there. I read a review of the hotel from another website and the comment about the low showerhead is true. An average person would have a terrible time using the shower. I immediately called another hotel and reserved a room. I then went to the office and canceled my stay with Ramada. Please! pay an extra $35 a night and stay at one of the neighboring hotels.", "Date": "Apr 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR333331927", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lynetterw"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98713-r14083726-Ramada_Limited_Dallas_Market_Center-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "98713", "Price": "$107"}}

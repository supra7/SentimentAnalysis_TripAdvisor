We are a family of 4 (2 year old and 2 month old at the time) and grandma and grandpa joined us. Our needs were a little complicated since we had two young children and would need to factor in returning to the hotel for naps and also, we have many food allergies to work around so we needed a place with a full kitchen so we could prepare our own meals, and we wanted a connecting room with the grandparents. Complicated? Just a little! It turned out that to get lodging at Disney that would accommodate all of these needs was WAY out of our budget. We found Staybridge Suites had the option of a one or two bedroom suite with full kitchen and living room. We had plenty of space so that we (and our parents) could have privacy if necessary. The kitchen came fully equipped with just about everything one could need to prepare most meals. The room was very clean and spacious and the living area was quite comfortable. We didn't use the pool but it was open late and supposedly kept at 82 degrees. The staff was very helpful. For example, one day the internet wasn't working in the business center and I needed to use it so they allowed me to use the internet in their office briefly. The location of the hotel was convenient as well. We went back to the hotel everyday for lunch/dinner and naps. The trip to and from Magic Kingdom was a little far because one has to take the tram to the TTC and the monorail in addition to the drive but it was certainly doable. The hotel was very close to Epcot.

I booked this hotel after reading a few hundred reviews on trip adviser as well as other review sites. although the reviews were helfull there were certain things i wanted to know in more detail which none of the reviews highlighted, so i will cover them here. But first, here is our general overview; Loved our stay. We found the room, a trio suite to be clean and spacious. The hotel location cannot be faulted, (Outside of the main Disney hotels) and we recieved great service. We requested a ground floor room which we had, and upon arrival we requested an in room kettle which was delivered within five minutes, fab ! After the first week we experianced some minor issues with the room, (A blocked WC and a loose towel rail) and again, these were fixed by the time we returned to our room later the same day. The breakfast; Whilst i can understand some of the negative reviews, at the end of the day this was no five star banquet, (but neither did we expect one !) there was enough choice to keep us happy; toast, waffles, cakes, cereals, eggs, fruit, sausage, yoghurt, ham, porridge, juices, pop, hot drinks. If you want to laze around all morning relishing your surroundings and eating the finest food then book a five star hotel elswhere, otherwise if you are like us and want to have something to eat that will keep you going half the day b4 hitting the disney parks then this will do nicely. the free snacks and drinks three nights a week are OK, perhaps not worth rushing back for, but if you are coming back early to the hotel anyway then its nice. Typically you get hot dogs, wine or beer, plus soft drinks. The pool and jacuzzi are clean and quite warm. They are open until about 23:00 hours every night. There are three free computers with internet and one free in the kids room. Indeed, as some others have suggested, they can be slow but still usable. LOCATION/TRANSPORT; IT TOOK ME MUCH DELIBERATION CHOOSING WHETHER OR NOT TO HIRE A CAR OR TO TRUST THE BUSSES. I TOOK A CHANCE WITH THE BUSSES AND IT WORKED OUT JUST FINE. THE PACKAGE DEAL I GOT FROM ENGLAND INCLUDED A FREE CAR FOR TWO WEEKS BUT THE INSURANCE WAS ANOTHER \u00c2\u00a3300, PLUS ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE $15 PER DAY DISNEY PARKING !!! THEN YOU HAVE PETROL, AND TIREDNESS ETC TO FACTOR IN SO FOR ME IT WAS A NO BRAINER. I GOT THE IMPRESSION FROM OTHER REVIEWS THAT THERE WERE REGULAR BUS TRANFERS TO THE DISNEY PARKS BUT NONE OF THEM GAVE A TIMETABLE SO HERE GOES; MAGIC KINGDOM; PICK UP AT 07:50, 10:20, 11:40, 13;40. RETURN AT 7PM, 9.45, AND 11.35/12.50 WHEN THE PARK OPENS TIL LATE. ANIMAL KINGDOM; 07:50 ONLY, RETURN 5.30PM ONLY. EPCOT; 09:20 AND 11:40. RETURN 16;10 AND 22:00 HOURS. HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: 09:20 AND 13:40, RETURN AT 15:55 AND 19:20. (23:20 WHEN THE PARK IS OPEN TIL LATE). ALL THE DISNEY BUSSES BETWEEN THE PARKS AND RESORTS ARE FREE AND REGULAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE AT EPCOT AND MISS THE 16:10 BUS, YOU COULD HOP ONTO A SHUTTLE TO MAGIC KINGDOM AND GET THE 17:45 BACK TO THE HOTEL. THERE ARE NO DIRECT BUSSES TO DOWNTOWN DISNEY, HOWEVER HOP ONTO A FREE DISNEY SHUTTLE FROM ANY OF THE PARKS TO SARATOKA SPRINGS RESORT AND ITS A FIVE MINUTE WALK FROM THERE. THERE ARE NO DIRECT BUS FROM THE HOTEL TO THE WATER PARKS BUT AGAIN FREE DISNEY SHUTTLES GO FROM ALL THE PARKS, ALL BE IT VIA A RESORT. TAXIS; ABOUT $6 EACH WAY TO DOWNTOWN DISNEY. ABOUT $20 EACH WAY TO MAGIC KINGDOM. $15 EACH WAY TO EPCOT, $30 EACH WAY TO EITHER THE FLORIDA MALL OR THE MALL AT MILLENIA. COSTS: A TYPICAL BURGER AND FRIES IN A DISNEY PARK SERVICE COUNTER IS BETWEEN 8-10 $. DRINKS ARE $3 INCLUDING TAX, SAME FOR AN ICE CREAM OR POPCORN. FOR A SIT DOWN MEAL YOU ARE LOOKING AT 25-35 $ PER ADULT FOR THREE COURSES OR BUFFET, MINUS DRINKS TAX AND SERVICE. THERE ARE ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE PLACES TO EAT TOO. THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD VALUE PLACES TO EAT NEAR THE HOTEL:cici pizza buffet, sizzler, shoneys, subway, steak n shake, papa johns pizza, chillys, to name but a few. Furthermore, a 15-20 minute walk away will bring you to Mcdonalds, golden corrall buffet and the highly recommended bahama breeze.

The kitchen was perfect for a family on vacation even though we only used the fridge and the microwave. Disney and Universal Studios allow you to bring food and drinks; so our fridge had water and soda ready for us. The breakfast was adequate. They had make your own waffles, eggs, some kind of breakfast meat (bacon/sausage/ham) rotated daily, yogurt, cereal, some kind of pastry and drinks (milk/coffee/team/soda/juices). They also have a manager reception at night 3 days a week from 5 PM to 7PM. That one is somewhat ok. One time they had BBQ food, it was good and free. Regardless of the food, they had free wine and soda as well which is not bad if you are going to order something in. The location is also wonderful. There is a big plaza across the Street from it where you can find casual dining. On the other side there is a Walgreen which is very convent if someone got sick (it has one of these quick clinks) or you forgot your sun block. It is very close to Disney.

If you aren't going to spend every day at the parks and just want somewhere to relax and explore Orlando by car, I would definitely stay here again. My friend and I stayed for 12 days in November 2011 with plans to visit all the theme parks. The hotel was fabulous, but the location and free shuttles didn't suit our needs. Basically I recommend staying at Disney while you visit Disneyworld, as you then have full access to all the parks day and night for free and then stay somewhere closer to Universal/Seaworld to see the other parks. The Staybridge is a really great hotel, but not a good location for visiting parks. The 'free shuttles to theme parks' from the Staybridge only go to Disney World and only 3 times a day (7.40am, 10.40am and 1.40pm) and there are limited return shuttles too (7pm, 10pm and 11.25pm). (Times vary by season) Basically most of the parks closed to the general public at 8pm and we then had to wait around until 10pm or later for the return shuttle. There is nowhere to sit or shelter while waiting for the shuttles. If you are staying at Disneyworld you can stay at parks much later. Disney Downtown is only about $8 cab ride from the hotel, but you can't get to the parks from there on the disney buses unless you are staying at Disney. To get to Seaworld or Universal it was a $25 flat rate cab ride each way - cheaper than a car hire and parking I suppose, but expensive extra on top of entrance fees. The hotel itself, I couldn't have asked for anything more. We had a 2 bedroom suite(both with ensuite bathrooms), full kitchen and lounge area. Better still, it include free buffet breakfast every day and free Happy Hour every Tues to Thurs night including wine, beer and food. The pool and spa were heated and great. We both loved it.

There is a free breakfast buffet which consisted of both hot and cold foods. The food was quite adequate, not top restaurant quality, but good for the price (free)! This hotel is located very near Disney, and is just slightly north of the Hotel Plaza Blvd entrance that takes you to Downtown Disney. There are many restaurants, fast food places, grocery, liquor store, drug stores nearby. Many are within walking distance if you do not have a car. I believe they have shuttle buses to take you to the parks, but I cannot comment on them as we had a car and did not use them. Overall, this hotel was a great deal!

We absolutely loved the suite.........2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, nice kitchen, 3 televisions. It was very spacious with large closets; reminded us of an apartment rather than a hotel suite. As other reviewers have noted, you must ask for a first floor room because there are no elevators. We were in Building A in Suite #213. I had requested a downstairs room close to the main building where breakfast is served and the free transportation picks up for Disney. The reservation clerk I spoke with prior to our arrival was very nice and accommodated my requests. We did hear a bit of road noise as our room faced the main roadway, but it was not too bad. You might want to request a room in another building if road noise bothers you. Now a word of caution about housekeeping. We normally stay at Marriott Residence Inns, and we are accustomed to their superior cleanliness standards. When we checked in, my daughter found an empty soda can under her bed. I found an empty dirty plastic cup under the master bed. When my husband went to get a glass from the kitchen cabinet, he picked up a glass that had red lipstick on the rim. I did report this to front desk, and I was just simply told they would report it to housekeeping. I thought an apology would have been nice. Breakfast buffet was good, but again, it did not compare to what we are accustomed to at Marriott Residence Inns. Each day the scrambled eggs were cold. When I reported this to the kitchen attendant on the first morning, I was told I could use the microwave to warm them. The problem never was corrected. My main word of warning for future guests is absolutely do NOT allow the front desk to call a taxi for you. When we checked in and mentioned that we wanted to go straight to Downtown Disney, the front desk clerk kindly volunteered to call a taxi for us. That taxi ride cost us $12. We called the same company to return us to the hotel that night. The next night we were at Downtown Disney and just used a Yellow Cab that was parked outside the World of Disney. That taxi ride (traveling the same distance) only cost us $6.60. The taxi that the hotel called for us cost almost twice the amount charged by Yellow Cab. When I reported this to the front desk, I was told that they always call the same company, and yes, they knew it cost more because the company charges a flat rate rather than using the meter. I replied that I felt like this was wrong to volunteer to call a taxi that they know overcharges their customers. I am curious as to why they would purposefully call a company that they know charges almost twice what a Yellow Cab charges unless perhaps they receive a kickback for calling that company. If you do choose to stay at this facility, just call your own taxi to avoid being overcharged. The location of the hotel is awesome, especially if you fly and do not rent a car. There is a Walgreens across the street, a grocery store behind the hotel, a reasonably priced souvenir ship across the street, and a Steak n Shake across the street. The Steak n Shake has great food with very, very reasonable prices. The free bus transportation to Disney is another perk. The bus picks up at the front door, stops by 2 other hotels, and then takes you to Disney. The bus picked us up at 7:50 each morning, and we were usually at the parks before 8:30 which was great since the parks opened at 9:00. I have left comments about the housekeeping, breakfast buffet, and taxi incident on the Staybridge website comment link. If they were to correct these issues, I would certainly consider staying at this property again.

Full kitchen and the Winn Dixue grocery store is just beside the hotel across a small street- great to have real meals while travelling. On check in they explain the green housekeeping policy- basically quick clean- make beds & change towels then on 3rd day vacuum & clean counters. 7th day change sheets- you can call housekeeping at any time if you need something additional.

Often Orlando hotels SAY they heat their outdoor pools to 80, but the pool heater just can't keep up with the pool size so the pool is more like mid 70s December to March- their pool honestly is well heated all winter long!!

Each room had its own bathroom, which is great for everyone and saved time when we were all getting ready at the same time to head out sightseeing. The bathroom was a bit small, but just to get a shower or bathe the kids it was sufficient. The beds were comfortable, however, I was not a fan of the pillows; I thought they felt like marshmallows for how soft they were. I had to put a pillow from the sofa into the pillow sham to firm it up a bit, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been having neck problems lately. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have brought my own, but I tend to leave them behind so I decided against it. Upon request, the hotel provided a crib for our 18-month old, which was made of metal and appeared to be safe by the new government reg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. While it was a bit on the small side, it was fine for him and he slept great in it every night. The kitchen was clean, and silverware, glasses, coffee mugs and plates were provided in the cabinets along with a refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher, which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. My 5 year-old son slept on the pullout sofa bed, and his only complaint was that the clock on the wall above him kept him awake. He said the bed was comfortable. We enjoyed the free buffet breakfast every morning, which offered different hot selections like eggs/omelets, bacon, ham, and sausage, as well as cereal, toast, muffins, donuts and a waffle maker.

I bought some snacks from the shop and thought it was a bit pricy ($4 for a bag of Doritos and a 20 oz. Diet Coke). They have different toiletries, etc., available for purchase, which are good in an emergency, but if you can wait, go to Walgreens across the street or Winn-Dixie in the plaza around the corner. There are lots of different restaurants in the area, also, to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. We also noticed there was a medical clinic across the street, which is good to know should an emergency arise. My father took my one son to the pool one day and said it was nice and clean (and warm).

Please note that I travel for work frequently and used Priority Club Points to pay for this stay (160,000 points). The biggest negative on this stay is that I requested a two bedroom suite and only got a one bedroom. As you will notice on previous reviews you can only get to the bathroom in a one bedroom suite through the bedroom. It makes it difficult in the middle of the night. After shouldering a 6 year old through amusement parks all day it was not a lot of fun to sleep on the couch. Plus- This is a great property with a staff that is always looking to help. Rooms and linens are kept extremely well for the age of this property. The amount of people from other countries make this a wonderful place to make interesting and amazing new friends. Mid week sundowner parties allow extra interaction. The pool is kept really warm, even during the off season. I spent a fortune on theme park tickets- but my kids loved the pool area. The breakfast will save you a lot of money (sorry, it is coming in my negatives). I am told that a property \"refresh\" is happening. I would stay here regardless. Although dated, a great stay. Giordonnos (spelling?) in the mall across the street has wonderful deep dish pizzas. You can not beat the location of this property! Negatives- The pool is kept warm so the need for chlorine is greater- make sure your kids have goggles (really inexpensive goggles available in the mall across the street). Most of the breakfast food is really bad (scrambled eggs, meats, etc.). Rely on waffles and fresh fruit to fuel your day. I was lucky enough to get a room next to where the breakfast truck delivery truck parked on the first floor.

(Included in the price really yes! ample foods to start your day) My only thing and its really not a complaint it is mearly a comment would be the cleaners come in to do a mini clean each day and once a week a full clean of the suites but you never know when they will be coming one day it may be early in the morning another maybe 5pm in the afternoon and when you are just coming back from a long day at the parks sometimes not what you would want. Another comment that may help We loved our Pool View room but bear in mind it is open till 11pm at night and there is noise from children and families till that time ( it didnt affect us one bit) Having said that This place is amazing, we will be back and will bring our children next time so spacious, great suites fab hotel lovely people a really pleasant holiday give it a go you really wont be disappointed here....

We hired a car for the whole holiday which we parked free of charge right outside the block our suite was in. This place is on the doorstep to Disney and 15 minutes from all the other non Disney attractions for which this hotel gives you lots of information about when you check in - a lovely touch was the information sheets that the hotel has put together for all driving guests which had all the addresses of virtually everything you wanted to do for your car SatNav, all Disney, Universal, Seaworld theme parks as well all the restaurants you can imagine locally of which there was many to choose from, including the supermarkets and shopping outlets. Another nice touch was on our last day due to a late flight back home, they let us have the suite until 2.30pm instead of having to vacate at 11am at no extra charge.

This was our second visit having stayed here in October 2009. I was afraid that the second time around things might not have been as good as I remembered but I needn't have worried. Check in was effortless. We had emailed the hotel before arriving requesting a ground floor room as my daughter had injured her foot shortly before the holiday. This request was met. We stayed in a 2 bed trio suite, 2 adults and 3 children aged 13, 11 and 5. The main bedroom had a king size bed, shower, bath and separate wc and handbasin. There was also a dressing area, a safe, extra linen, towels, iron and ironing board in this room. The second bedroom had 2 queen beds, shower, bath and separate wc and handbasin. There was ample closet space in this room. I liked this room because there were windows on two walls making it nice and bright. My only fault with this hotel is that the room can be quite dark. The kitchen seemed to be very well stocked, although I never used anything other than a wine glass! We did use the fridge though. We froze bottles of water to bring to the parks with us as we didnt like the bottled water on sale at the Disney parks or the price of them. The breakfast as other reviewers have said was a great start to the day - eggs, bacon, bagels, make your own waffle station, pastries, fruit, juices etc. There was something to suit everyone. There are Styrofoam cups if you want a take away cup of coffee and paper plates and bowels to bring cereal or pastries back to your room. We did this a couple of mornings when the older kids slept in. The last time we stayed we didnt attend any sundowners Tues, Wed and Thurs 5 - 7pm) but this time we did and I have to say they were great. It was a really good way to meet other people staying at the hotel and I was surprised that the food was so good particularly on the \"Cook Out\" nights. Pool area nice with plenty of sunbeds and towels. A couple of times they ran out of towels but they were replaced very quickly. There are plenty of pool toys available to keep the kids occupied. A bit of music around the pool area would have been nice though. There is a games room with arcade games, at a cost, and a computer. My teenager loved this for checking up with friends at home. We used the computers in the business centre to arrange car hire and found this very useful. A couple of times it was difficult to get at the computers in here though as there were teenagers using them to go on facebook. No under 18s are allowed to use the computers in this room but no one seemed to be monitoring it. It is only a small issue anyway. We didnt use the shuttle buses this holiday so I cant comment on them only to say that when we stayed in 2009 we used them all the time and found the service excellent. I am nearly finished - I know this is a long review, sorry. One of the main reasons we picked the Staybridge LBV on our first visit and again this time is the location. 10 minutes to disney and 25 to universal. Also for those evening when you aren't in the park there are ample restaurants within walking distance. Orlando Ale House and Olive Garden are two I would highly recommend.

Im an experienced traveller both to Orlando for holidays and to the USA in general for work and have stayed in various big name Hotels and on site at Disneyworld so wasnt expecting huge things from this more moderatly priced hotel but have to say everything about it was spot on. We arrived on the Saturday after thanksgiving and was quickly given our room after being given a little bag of cookies. We were asked by a lady on the opposite desk if we were interested in discount park tickets but said we were sorted and were sent on our way with a smile, no hard sell. The suite itself was on the 3rd floor facing the pool. I was aware that there were no elevators so expected to have to carry the cases up, but its only once up and once down so no hardship. If your party isnt able to do this im sure the guys at front desk would be happy to help. The suite had everything we needed, nice little kitchen, comfy lounge area with a good sized TV, nice bedroom and clean and well layed out bathroom. It was the little extras that made it for me though like the free in room safe and the free wi-fi. In the morning we did notice that one of the plug sockets was damaged and let front desk know. When we returned that evening it was fixed and we had a message apologising, there really was no need but nice touch. We made use of the free breakfast buffet about half the time we were there, its not as good as going to Dennys or Perkins for breakfast but theres plenty to choose from and if youre on a budget a great way to start the day. The hot food wasnt great but the pastries and coffee were lovely and i loved making myself a fresh waffle with maple syrup. It was a little chilly when we went but we did manage to use the pool a couple of times, its lovely and clean. Even at this time of year we saw the friendly maintenance folks cleaning the pool daily, it really was spotless. During our stay we had a weekend at Clearwater at the Hilton hotel and despite the Hilton being great we loved coming back to our little home from home. Location wise you couldnt ask for me, its a 10 minute drive to the Disney Parks, 15 mins to Universal and 5 mins to Seaworld. There is a shuttle bus to the parks but we had a car so never used it, it didnt seem too full when we saw it outside but again it was a quiet time of year. There are several restaurants in walking distance, we loved Chilli's for a nice no frills meal with a nice cold beer and Giordannos across the road does awesome chicago style stuffed Pizzas. There is also Joe's crab shack, Sizzler, Dennys, Black Angus and a few others in walking distance and you have Crossroads plaza a 2 minute drive away with lots of other eating spots including the awesome Sweet Tomatoes. There is a wallgreens near the hotel and a Winn Dixie out the back, i found the Winn Dixie to be much quieter and friendlier than Walmart and not much more expensive. Theres also so fast food take away places next to the Winn Dixie that would be good for a quiet night in with a pizza or chinese. Overall i have to say this is probably the best place ive stayed at in Orlando, beating the Disney hotels for convenience and value hands day and at least equal to the higher end off site hotels ive stayed at like the Wyndham resort and Hilton Garden inn in terms of service and quality of stay. So long as you can cope with the lack of lifts i would recommened this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cOK stay - good location\u201d", "Author": "carlyscan", "ReviewID": "UR98467745", "Content": "Check in was fast and friendly.

The property is a little old and I always felt like the room was dirty. The tile in the bathrooms were in need of serious cleaning or replacement. The pillows were the worst I've had in a hotel. They looked like a throw pillow for a couch with a cover on it. They barely measured 14 inches wide and were very lumpy. Internet... what internet? It was so slow they might as well say it's not available. It reminded me of a 56k modem and during peak times, a 28k modem. The free breakfast should be free as it was one of the worst! The eggs were horrible (foamy and lacked taste), the sausage floated in grease, and had no bacon. They did have fresh fruit and bread. It was so bad we opted to pay for breakfast elsewhere.

One other thing.... if your stay includes a Friday or Saturday night, getting off on Exit 68 from I-4 will teach you a whole new vocabulary. Buy a good Orlando map and avoid that road during peak hours.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cNeeds To Re-capture It's Potential\u201d", "Author": "Drew47", "ReviewID": "UR78521021", "Content": "For the price, this was a great deal. As a member of the family of hotels' loyalty program, for us, it was a no brainer: free breakfast, a two-room, 2 full-bath, full-kitchen suite for $100/night plus tax...and only minutes away from Disney attractions. Throw-in a package deal: 7 nights for the price of 5 and 6 days of Disney park passes for the price of four, and this is hard to beat. But, you have to be prepared for a bit of 'rough around the edges.' Trim everywhere on the exterior needed a new coat of paint or completely repaired due to central Florida's relatively brutal heat and humidity. We found small areas required stucco repair, and some wood trim was visibly deteriorating. Previous reviews we have read noted the carpets in the rooms appeared dirty. I cannot disagree. Housekeeping could've been better. Rooms have coffee service in them, though, with a free breakfast, I never had a need to use it. However, we just happen to inspect the service and found that there were only de-caffeinated coffee packs available, and a used coffee filter pack still in the coffee maker from the last guest. Yuck. Throughout our stay, this coffee service was never re-supplied. There is a form for you to list any thing in the room that needs attention. I noted the wall clock in the common sitting area was not working(dead battery?) . The form appeared to have been collected by housekeeping, but I never saw the clock fixed nor was there any mention made by hotel staff of having received my note. Also points off for the dryers in the laundry area. $1.50 per load and our clothes were as wet as if they just came out of the wash machine. Another guest had the same experience as us as we were washing at the same time. The pool and the jacuzzi were fine, though we used it only 2-3 times during our week stay. I assume the pool uses one of those salt-based chlorinators as there was a definite salty taste to the water (yeah right, you try and keep pool water out of your mouth when you swim!). Otherwise, the pool water did appear clean. The lobby was clean and inviting. The free breakfast was great. One step above what you would find in a Holiday Inn Express or similar. It was actually more of a buffet, with two serving lines. As the hotel is comprised of several 3-story buidlings around a large court yard, which includes the pool, laundry service building and a covered veranda area, there are no elevators, just external stairs. If you cannot 'do stairs' I recommend informing the hotel at the time you are making reservations. A Winn-Dixie supermarket and a liquour store is literally across the street making use of the suite's kitchen a very easy alternative to expensive restaurant fare. Downtown Disney is only minutes a way by car, and not difficult to get to either. There are money quality eateres nearby, too. While the hotel offers FREE bus transportation to all Disney parks, it isn't the best. You can't complain though, since it is free. At one point it took us an hour to get from Epcot back to our hotel as the bus route also services at least two other hotels in the area. For the morning trips to the parks, as our hotel was the last on the route, it was standing room only...and I must believe some had to be left behind as there was eventually no more room. After the second or third day, we drove ourselves to the parks, forking over the $14/day parking. Admittedly it was due to an injury requiring crutches and a wheelchair, but I must believe we would have eventually decided to drive on our own as did one family sans injury because of the amount of time it took to get to and from the parks otherwise. The schedule of pick up and return to the hotel is also a bit limited. Overall, if you are on a Disney adventure and don't want to stay at a Disney property because of the cost, this is a great choice. Since you won't be doing much more than sleeping and eating breakfast here, going for something more expensive is truly a waste of money, IMO. The hotel, however, needs to invest a bit of money in this money maker to keep it up to Disney quality.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cgood budget hotel with minor problems\u201d", "Author": "PaddySch", "ReviewID": "UR78319470", "Content": "Pros: 88 USD for a hotel with Breakfast, Disney Shuttle (all parks), 4 times a week Dinner and a one bedroom.

There are 3 tv's, free wifi, a full cooker, large fridge, safe, iron and ironing board, two hairdryers, and loads of storage space. There are 2 bathrooms. The breakfast is included and there's a great choice, so if you're going to Theme Parks you are not hungry again till late afternoon. With 5 of us, the rate was so good, my son said you would hardly get a hostel as cheap if you divided the nightly rate by 5. There is a business centre which we used to print off airline tickets, and no charge for that. There is a swimming pool and jacuzzi and a gym I think although we didn't use it. The hotel is literally around the corner from Disney and about 15 minutes in the car from Universal. There is a free courtesy bus to Disney and also to the outlets but we had hired a car so we used the car anyway. There is a great Walmart on Turkey Lake Road, open 24 hours and with a McDonalds in it as well, but there is a Walgreens and a Wine Dixie beside the hotel. Also there are lots of restaurants nearby. The beauty of this hotel is that there is so much room in the suites that everybody has their own space. The room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels, toiletries etc. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Orlando. I think it's an all round great hotel, in a great location, and so much space for everyone that you don't get the normal teenage arguing at all. On a visit about 10 years ago we rented a house in Kissamee but it was too far out and you had a long drive every night after the theme parks. Our flight was an evening flight so we were able to leave our suitcases in a locked room in the reception area and go back later for them. There is a huge parking area, free of charge.

The 2 bedroom suites are great. They're roomy. The rooms have a kitchen, a fridge, an oven, a microwave, dishes, everything, a dvd player... They have light housekeeping daily. So, every day when we came back the beds were made, we had fresh towels and the room was ready to go another round with us. The breakfast was awesome. We didn't pay to go to breakfast once. That saved us lots of $. Don't expect steak and eggs or an omelet station or anything. Juice, milk, cereal, scrambled eggs, a meat, toast, oatmeal, waffles, great coffee, tea. Coffee is out 24 hrs a day too. It's great to just go downstairs together or just whenever you're ready. Also, during the week the staff will bbq burgers and/or dogs and put out chips, beer, soda. So we saved again there because there were 2 nights that we didn't even have to go out for dinner. It's a short walk to the drug store, olive garden, mcdonalds, many fast food places to choose from. There's a computer room, a game room, a laudry room. It's pretty much like home. Just like some other reviews, my small complaint was the carpet was older and somewhat dirty. But don't worry because when I check out I let them know that that was my only concern and they assured me that they're getting new carpet, so that will be taken care of shortly. We did not rent a car and we had no problem with the bus. Sometimes it was pakced, but so you have to stand for 10 - 15 mins, who cares.

We loved the hotel in general. We saw it's high rating on TripAdvisor and liked the fact that it had plenty of space for a family. Traveled with 6 people, three adults and three teens. Check-in was smooth and trouble-free and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were given some coupons for nearby restaurants upon check-in and invited to the free daily breakfast and afternoon reception (held Tues, Weds and Thurs evenings). The hotel is a \"WDW Good Neighbor Hotel\", meaning you can buy Disney tickets here (though not necessarily at discounts). Hotel's location is outstanding. It is located just off Apopka-Vineland Road, just a couple miles north of I-4 exit 68. This road is somewhat of a tourist strip, but the hotel is not located in the busy section. Downtown Disney's entrance is 5 minutes or less away, and Universal and Sea World are no more than 10 minutes up I-4. You are really no more than 15 minutes away from any Disney location or park. The hotel is not smack on top of other hotels like some in this area; it is located by itself in a very quiet area, although everything you need is just minutes away, including several sit-down restaurants, fast food, and a grocery store (Winn-Dixie). If you're flying in from Orlando Airport, expect maybe a 25 minute drive to the hotel. We didn't encounter any problems during our stay. The rooms were VERY spacious, with a huge living room and two bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, which was wonderful. The bathrooms themselves are pretty small, however, but we didn't mind too much. The sink and counter is located outside of the bathroom. The carpets, as you'll see in other reviews on this site, are somewhat outdated and dirty, but the rest of the room is spotless. Side note, the grounds of the hotel are very nice, with nice landscaping. Pool is a little small but is well taken care of. It appeared, during our stay, that a maintenance staff was replacing cabinets and doors in some of the rooms, so maybe they're renovating somewhat. Hotel has free wireless internet, but the signal is hard to pick up and weak at most times. Beds and couches/chairs were very comfortable. Wished we stayed longer!

Winn-Dixie allowed you to access their store card to get store savings. At Staybridge, the free breakfast was great with what we considered to be a reasonable variety of foods. Mid-week they have Sundowner Receptions. Tuesday evening they had chinese night with egg rolls and fried rice, Wednesday evening they had a cookout with hot dogs and burgers and Thursday they had chips and salsa. All this was included in the price of the room. These reception foods, while not truly complete meals, really cut our expenses on eating out as we simply added a light snack. In addition to the foods, they had beer, wine and soda also free. The only thing I would change is more bus service to/from the theme parks, or at least Downtown Disney. You had a full kitchen to cook, but if you came back to your room for lunch and a swim, you had no way to return to the parks later in the day. We chose to use our car which made the travel to/from the parks fast and easy, However, you must pay $14 per day for parking at Disney if staying off property.

The living and dining area in our suite was dirty and in need of refurbishment. We frequently had blackened feet and dirty socks from the carpet. However, as a place to crash at the end of the day it was acceptable. There was a serious pipe leak that put the small fitness room out of use and caused loud air dryers to be placed throughout the dining/reception area. Our room didnt get the attention that we had previously. On two occasions our room was not prepared and frequently rubbish not removed. I suspect that as with all of the travel industry the reccession has hit hard and perhaps their renovation and/or cleaning schedule has been affected. The maids seemed constantly busy working long hours, perhaps their numbers have been cut? The positives outweigh the negatives though. The location is great, Disney nearby, Universal a 10 minute drive (take Vineland Apopka Road, Sandlake then Turkey Lake to miss the Interstate (4) traffic). The I4 is 5 min drive and easy to access. Plenty of places to eat, Joes Crab Shack, Chillis, Red Lobster and various other family friendly restaraunts withinin walking distance.

The Marriott Village is too busy and has no character, the people are rude and I feel like a business traveler when staying there. The Holiday Inn SunSpree is dirty old and has no value. Other hotels in the area are commercial and lack the personality that this particular Staybridge Suites has.

The rooms are spotless, the grounds are constantly being kept, there is no noise once you are in the rooms and the respect for each neighbor is given once everyone recognizes the quality of the hotel. The Breakfasts are bountiful and never ending. The game room for the kids is, well its there but not much to it, but we never use it anyway as there is always so much more to do off property.

In a politically correct society, this location showed their true character by having the Easter Bunny in the lobby visiting with all of the children on Easter Sunday. I was amazed that a business would do this and elated that this location took the time to show us how much they cared about children on such a religious holiday. We enjoy the Sundowners reception that they have on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays which offers complementary soda, beer and wine along with a small buffet of appetizers, hamburgers or Hotdogs.

My kids loved how the birds and squirrels would come for treats. My daughter said she felt like Snow White singing in the forest! You simply can't beat the value.

I was OK with it, but it could use an upgrade. I would recommend asking for a 3rd floor room. We were on the 2nd floor. A couple nights we had \"noisy\" neighbors above us. Sounded like a herd of elephants going in and out the door for a couple hours. Breakfast was also OK. After 5 mornings, I was a bit bored with the offerings. Always plenty to eat though. Go early if you want a table. If you arrive after 8:00 a.m, you are likely to encounter a crowd. Hotel is within 5 minutes of the main entance to Disney. SO CONVENIENT! Lots of restaurants just blocks/minutes from the hotel. Olive Garden, Chili's, Carrabbas, Steak-n-Shake, TGI Fridays, etc. We also used the Winn Dixie grocery store right next to the hotel to stock up on drinks, snacks for evening time.

Let me preface my review by simply stating it was AWESOME! I traveled w/ my wife and family, 2 boys ages 10 & 12 and we stayed in \"tri-suite\" on the third floor overlooking the pool. Having stayed at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter 2 years prior in basically a motel room, the entire family marveled at the size of our room. We had 2 bedrooms, 1 w/ 2 queens for the boys w/ their own bathroom and television, our room w/ a king, bathroom and television and a large living room(also a television) and kitchenette. The room was spotless and updated. In fact, we had to wait a few hours to check in so the rugs that we cleaned that day could dry properly. Our room was made up daily with fresh towels and I believe on our 4th day it was thoroughly cleaned and linens changed. The whole property is beautiful and the perfect size. Its a three story building that surrounds the pool and courtyard. The grounds are impeccable and the staff could not be more friendly or more helpful. I did my homework and spoke with the manager, Melissa, prior to booking. She was upfront and honest stating that the property was not brand new nor was it a five star hotel. I still booked for a variety of reasons; price, location, ammenities , free breakfast and managers happy hours, and the ability to get a suite. The suite was really great. Having the room to get away from the kids and give them their own space made for great relaxation. We had a perfect view of the pool and the courtyard and pretty much let our kids go. There is a small gameroom w/ 2 kid friendly computers w/ internet access. They also supply some pool toys and plenty of lounge chairs and tables. The whole place had a really \"safe\" feel to it. As far as location, you could not get a more convenient spot. You are literally 5 min. from Downtown Disney and no more than 15 min to any attraction. There are lots of restaurants, many within walking distance as well as a grocery store across the parking lot. I would recommend the Orlando Ale House for food. Big place with lots of T.V.'s , good food, big portions and very reasonable. The hotel has a shuttle but we had a rental car so I can not comment on it. The property is on a service road off a main drag so the road noise was non-existent. The free breakfast was great. I know a lot of reviews say it was repetetive but we found it more than ample. The managers receptions on Tues, Wed and Thurs had beer, wine, hots & burgers and a whole variety of snacks, again all free. We ate outside everyday at an umbrella table and the inside had plenty of seating. The kids could even make their own Belgian waffles. We saved a lot of time and money starting our day with a good meal and in beautiful surroundings. In conclusion, I wish everything I researched so hard came out so good. I would go back in a second and would highly recommend the place to anyone, especially families. Do yourself a favor and go online and get an Orlando Magicard. I think I saved about $60.00 a night and all you have to do is mention it. We traveled 3 nights in the prime season and 5 nights after prime and my total bill was $1340.00 If I had one criticism it would be that the pool was too warm.

We stayed here for seven nights and the location to all the Disney parks is perfect - just a mile up the road from Downtown Disney and the same road will take you to all the parks in minutes. You can take the complimentary shuttle bus from the hotel, which we did one day and it was fine, I prefer not to have to worry about the bus schedule. There are a variety of restaurants and stores right accross the street. This is an excellent location! We reserved a two bedroom king suite, which was more than comfortable for two adults and two kids (11 & 14) for the same price we would have paid for a moderate room on Disney property. The boys had their own room with their own beds, bathroom and TV and we had our own room, bathroom and TV. The living room was comfortable with a sofa bed (if you need it), lounge chair, TV with DVD and VCR player. The fully equiped kitchen and dining area were perfect for our needs and there is free internet service in each room. The room was very clean and housekeeping came in every day to make beds and replace towels and soaps. They come in every third day for a full cleaning. The one thing I would recommend is trying to get a first floor room if you have a lot of luggage because there are 3 levels and no elevators so you have to carry your luggage up yourself. We requested a first level pool view room, which was a great location for the kids, but if you prefer peace and quiet, stay away from the pool side of the hotel - it can get a bit busy at times. The hotel has an arcade, with computer, a laundry room, business center with computers, gym and a library. The pool was very nice with a toddler pool, full size pool and a jacuzzi with fresh towels always available. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to any of our needs. The complimentary breakfast each morning was great, with a wide variety of breakfast foods and drinks for just about anyones taste. There is an evening reception with free food and drinks three nights a week. This benefit alone saved us a lot of money each day in meals and you are welcome to eat there or bring the food back to your room. I found the grounds to be very nice and relaxing with plenty of plants and places to sit an talk.

We come down from Jacksonville to relax a few days and enjoy the city. The room rates are really good right now. In the past these rooms have ran about $150.00 a night. You can get them for about $75.00 right now. The staff here is great. The hotel is really great for the money. Very nice pool area and large. Now this is 'Orlando' and full of tourest and kids and so is the hotel. But the good thing is they leave about 9 a.m. for the parks and don't return until late. So you almost have the pool to yourself if you want to relax at the hotel. The buffet breakfast is good. It comes with the price of the room and you should find something on it to start your day. The only problem I encouter is when they have scrambled eggs, I wish they would cook them more. The cook must like runny eggs, I don't. Now the rooms are starting to show some wear but they are kept clean and room service does a good job. Unless you want to pay a lot more to stay in a 5 Star Hotel stay here. Well worth the money. It's a great exit and has a number of restaurants on the block that you can walk to. Tip of the stay: If you want to avoid a crowd at breakfast eat between 7:30-8:00 a.m. or at 9:30 a.m. And if you encouter any problem just talk to the management that will gladly take care of you.

It was just perfect as far as we were concerned. There are 2 large bedrooms, one with a kingsize bed and the other with 2 doubles. There is also a sofa bed. We have 3 teenage children and had plenty of room. There are 2 bathrooms, 2 hairdryers, 3 tvs, a roomsafe, an iron and ironing board and a kitchen with a full size cooker, huge fridge and microwave. There is free internet access in the suite. We brought our laptop and the kids were able to go on MSN, BEBo etc. Our suite was spotless. There were fresh towels and beds made every day. There was bath soap, face soap and shampoo renewed every day. I thought the furnishings were lovely. There is a kitchen table also. Normally our kids fight on hols if we are in a small living area but there were no arguments at all what with the 3 tvs and the internet access. There is a courtesy bus to the Disney parks - we were given the schedule when we checked in. The breakfast has a good choice. They have paper plates for people who want to take away the breakfast. A few days when the kids slept late we brought up cereal and pastries to the room for them which was very handy. The pool area was lovely, a big pool, a small for toddlers and a jacuzzi. There are loads of loungers and plenty of fresh towels at the pool for everyone. The hotel is literally a two minute drive from Disney World. A tip when you're coming out of the Disney Parks - head for the Downtown Disney area and that road takes you out to the exit near the hotel. For Universal take a left onto Apopka Vineland Ave (outside the hotel) and then the next left up Palm Parkway. This road becomes Turkey Lake Road and there is an entrance to Universal on that road. There is also a Walmarts on Turkey Lake Road, but there is a Walgreens just outside the hotel. There are loads of restaurants just outside also. I can highly recommend the Pizza Hut just around the Corner on Palm Parkway, the food is great, very cheap and the staff are lovely. There is also a great takeaway pizza place - there is a card on the worktop. We go abroad every year mainly to the States as my husband works for an airline. With 3 teenagers we are classed as 5 adults so accommodation is always expensive but we try to get it for a reasonable rate. We got a special on this hotel as they were giving a one bedroomed suite for the price of a two offer when we were enquiring. We also booked the Disney tickets. A tip - the difference between a 3 day and 5 day Disney pass is only 10 dollars in total - 5 dollars per day so it's worth getting the 5 day one. With Universal when we were buying a 2 day pass at the park they offered us a pass for a week for an extra 5 dollars each so we took that as well! Entry to Disney and Universal is by card (ticket) and fingerprint so don't mix up the tickets or they won't match with your fingerprints when you enter. For anyone new to Disney the hopper pass means you can go between the parks and Disney have courtesy buses that go park to park all day. If you are shopping what used to be the Belz Mall is now the Orlando Prime Outlets. It's good. There are other outlets - Orlando Premium Outlets - we found them expensive. There are small outlets a short drive from the hotel - Lake Buena Vista outlets and we found them pretty good. In summary I can highly recommend this hotel. It's got everything you need in it and also it's in a great location for everything. The area is safe and also the hotel is very quiet. I can honestly say that we loved it. The hotel was recommended to me by a friend who stayed there in June and I would recommend it to anyone going to Orlando.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Smyrna Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBreakfast Was About It !!!!!\u201d", "Author": "tomgna13", "ReviewID": "UR38090918", "Content": "This was our experience. With the pictures on their website we thought we would pull up to something MUCH nicer. Check in was fine and the man was quite nice. We even received a bag of cookies.

The rugs were dirty, the furniture is old and dirty and in poor condition. The baseboard molding had tons of dust on it. It grossed us out. The overall appearance of the inside of the room is poor. Clogged sinks, leaky toilet, dirty conditions in shower area. The maid service is terrible. They barely clean the rooms before you check in and while we stayed there for three days our beds weren't made until after 5:00 in the afternoon and towels, facecloths and bath mats were taken but not replenished. Why???? They only give you shampoo and a bar of soap. The water is hard so a conditioner is a must. We had to go to Walgreens across the street to purchase some. Also bring your own lotion and dirty laundry bag because you don't get those either. We also had a room where they stored their garbage bags throughout the day outside our door. It smelled great in the 90 degree heat. We never used the pool because it was always overcrowded and we were afraid of catching something. We have stayed at many hotels with our 3 children before. NEVER have we stayed at one so poorly taken care of or so neglected with such POOR room service. The best perk of this hotel is that it is within a 10 minute or so drive to most disney resorts and parks. We also enjoyed the all you can eat breakfast buffet. Many choices, delicious and it was nice and hot. The employees for the food area were nice and polite. So our review to you is....if you are looking for a great breakfast stay here.

I thought this would be a bit much (not to mention expensive) after 10 days. The Staybridge suites fitted the bill perfectly. The 2 bedrm/2bathroom (3 TV) suite was spacious enough that we could spread out during the down times back at the hotel. The kitchen facilities meant that we didn't have to go out for every meal. The breakfast was basic but adequate - the kids especially liked the waffle station. I also appreciated having the laundry - vital to have this during our month-long trip to the US.

The Winn Dixie supermarket is just across the road, and a number of other convenience stores and restaurants are within easy walking distance.

We had a 1-bedroom suite on the 3rd floor of Bldg #17 facing the pool area. The hotel's location is absolutely ideal for visiting Disney World. It takes no more than 15-20 minutes to get to/from any of the Disney parks by car in the morning or when returning even at rush hour. There is a Winn-Dixie (one of the better ones we have shopped at in Florida) supermarket and 24-hour Walgreens across the street plus numerous stores, eating places, etc., within a 1/4 mile. I found that if you are driving a car with a GPS don't follow the Disney direction signs on I4, follow the GPS's directions, it will save you time and distance. I won't re-hash the previous reviews here as they are fairly accurate regarding the room conditions (some to moderate wear and tear and disrepair), the staff (very friendly), and the food (a bit limited in breakfast selections but OK otherwise, the evening receptions were a bit disappointing but at least there is free wine and beer). There was a large gap under the room's door which allowed plant debris from the courtyard to blow in under the door. There are at least 50 cable TV channels to watch including the local Weather Channel feed which should keep kids entertained when not out. If you don't want to listen to little (and big) kids screaming in the pool until 11PM every night, request a room facing the outsides of the buidlings or one overlooking the west-side courtyard. They said we would have to move twice if we wanted a different room when we discovered the noise at 9 PM on the first night. The heating/cooling system is a residential-type split system with the compressor/condenser unit outside so it is quiet in the room when running compared to the integrated systems found at many extended stay hotels. They have two free PC's with a printer in their Business Center and signs clearly state they are for use by guests over 18 years old. Thus you don't have kids hogging them all day and night. They also have both wireless and wired free high speed internet connections in all the rooms. The rates here were cheaper than the Residence Inn Lake Bunea Vista, which is about 1 mile due east.

I'm not sure what some reviewers are talking about when they call the rooms \"dated.\" I suppose that some people must believe that hotels need to remodeled every couple of years or something. The entire hotel itself cannot be more than 10 years old, and the room we had was fine. Yes it had a couple of signs of use, but lets get real, this isn't an expensive hotel. If you want perfect you will be spending $300+ these days, and even then you can be dissapointed. The courtyard and pool areas are very-very nice. The breakfast buffet was clean and had a good selection of breakfast items. They even have a rather large laundy area (not that we used it, but would come in handy if you were staying longer). Every staff member we encountered was friendly, and made us feel welcome and appreciated (which seems to be hard to come by these days with some hotels). The only small ding I will give our room was that the AC system did need the coils and ductwork cleaned. Some other reviewers did mension this, and our room AC did have noticable dust on the vents and a musty smell when we fired it up for a couple of hours when we arrived.

Check in/check out was fast and friendly, our room was clean and the perfect size for our family of 5. We booked the 2 bdrm/2 bath suite directly by phone and asked for the Magicard rate. This saved us around $40 per night, so keep that in mind if you decide to book. You cannot get the Magicard rate by Internet. The pool area was a decent size and never seemed crowded. There are some inflatable pool toys for the kids to play with, and plenty of lounge chairs and tables. Breakfast was a good variety of hot and cold items, coffee, sodas, juice, fruit, and so forth. There are also several restaurants within a 5 minute walking distance. Across the street you will find Sizzlers, Steak-n-shake, Giordanos, etc. And behind the hotel (another 5 minute walk) there is a Papa John's pizza, an ice cream shop, and a Winn Dixie grocery store which is perfect for buying bottled water and other necessities. We used the free shuttle service to the parks for both pick up and return. The bus was very comfortable and stops at all 4 Disney parks. You will receive a shuttle schedule upon check in. Make sure you are at the bus stop at least 5 minutes before pick up. The bus comes on time (sometimes a couple minutes early) and it will not wait for you. It picks up whoever is there and takes off without waiting 5 or 10 minutes, etc. So if you're not there, you will be left behind. A word of advice about return times. The Animal Kingdom closed at 5:00 and the bus didn't arrive until 6:15, so for an hour we basically stood in the parking lot waiting. With the Magic Kingdom, the park closed at 9:00 with fireworks ending between 9:15 - 9:20. The bus pickup was at 9:30, so this left little time to get to the parking lot. We were literally running to get there. ( After a long day and tired feet, this was quite painful!) So if you use the shuttle for the return trip from the Magic Kingdom, make sure you are near the front gate when the fireworks are presented and then make a beeline to the monorail as soon as they are over. Skip the express monorail! Everyone goes there and you will end up in a line. Go straight to the resort monorail and you will get right on. The 2nd stop is the TTC and that is where you will find the bus. If you don't do this, you will most likely end up in a Taxi instead of the bus. Downtown Disney is less than 10 minutes away but it is not within walking distance. We took a cab for $12 each way. The hotel lobby will call a taxi for you so you don't have to arrange that yourself. When you're ready to leave for the return trip, you will find many taxis waiting outside the Marketplace and West Side so it is easy to get a ride with no problem.

It was wonderful. The apartment was clean and spacious. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The bedroom was spacious with an enormous bed! a walk in closet area (which was big enough for my 10 year old to utilise as a bedroom- see photo) which aslo housed the safe , spare linen and towels. The bathroom was also in the main bedroom. The bathroom would be my only critisism as it was tiny . The lounge area was a fair size even though we left the sofa bed perminately made up for my son and the kitchen was plenty big enough for our puposes although we could have made use of a grill and we took our own travel kettle ( as we had read that one isn't provided). Always plenty of ice The housekeeping was regular for change of towels and bed making although could be quite late in the afternoon. The staff were all really freindly and helpful. The breakfast was great ( some have said it's repetetive - but how many different things do you eat for breakfast at home !!) The choices are - either scambled egg or omlete with either bacon- sausage burger or ham, always a choice of cereal, fruit juices, bread, yogurt,grated cheese, boiled eggs, fresh fruit and tea & coffee ( wolfgang puck - fab !)and muffins, cake ,dohnuts or cinammon whirls. Then of course the waffle maker !! How much more choice does one need !!! The communial areas were well kept and clean as was the pool. It isn't a huge pool but big enough for a quick dip and a relaxing cool down ( there is also a hot tub and by god it was a very HOT tub so we didn't use that - remember the temp was a 100 degrees !) There is aslo a small games room and gym but we didn't need or have the time to use either of them. The location ifsbrilliant. So easy to get to and only minutes away from the entrance to DownTown Disney with complete access to all other Disney parks. Just across the road from WinneDix and Walgreens and within walking distance to several restaurants. Hope this helps not sure if there is any thing else to add.

The room was very clean on arrival but the standards of replenishing the goodies ( eg popcorn) fell rapidly as the stay wore on. It then improved when we handed a $30 tip to the chambermaid ( Us brits loathe this US habit). Room/suite This was very spacious with a king size bed for us and a double each for our teenage sons. The bath was a bit small and could be hard to get out of especially for my wife who has arthritis of the knees. There was a kitchen ( stock somewhat spartan) a very large US size fridge as well as a cooker and microwave. A toaster was also present and a coffee maker but no keetle ( is this a British item?). We ate out most of the time but feel we would have struggled to fix a full meal here. Air con good and can be controlled to a level that suits the occupant with ease. Swimming pool Good size with jacuzzi. Open till 11pm which was great on coming back from a day at the parks. Other facilities. Good hot buffet breakfast included in room rate. There was a business centre with 3 free internet terminals and signs in English and Spanish ( lots of South Americans staying here) advising that there was a maximum use of 15 minutes at a time and strictly no under 18's ( they had their own single terminal in the games' room). These rules seemed unenforced and I spent long periods of time waiting for young teenagers to stop talking to their boy/girlfriends back home. Washers and dries plentiful at $1.50 a load- efficent as well as reasonably priced. No restaurant/ bar in hotel but plenty in walking distance. Very small shop on site not used.

Having two separate bedrooms and 2 baths worked perfectly. I would say that although I didn't think the suite or furnishings were \"worn\", the pull-out sofa bed had a caved in mattress. Not unlike most hotel sofa beds however. We had my 13 year old nephew sleep there, so he didn't really care. We had a 2nd floor room overlooking the pool which was great to watch other family members while at the pool. The pool is adequate...not very big as others stated, but it was very clean and had nice sitting areas as well as a hot tub. Even though we were visiting at a busy time, we literally had the pool area to ourselves at 10am in the morning. The free breakfast was wonderful! Hot items such as the fresh waffles and omelettes were a nice touch. My sister saved a ton of money not having to pay for breakfast for her family of 5. We literally filled up before heading out to Epcot. The parks are literally one exit away, so it is VERY convenient if you have your own transportation. If you plan to stay here, I would suggest becoming a Priority Club member first (it's free) before booking. As a Priority Club member, I received a basket of homemade cookies upon arrival as well as top notch attention. It also didn't hurt that I was wearing my \"TripAdvisor\" baseball cap during check-in! At first, the master bedroom toilet wasn't flushing properly and we also noticed the 2nd bathroom was missing shampoo and conditioner, but both were remedied IMMEDIATELY when I called down to the front desk. Literally, maintanence was at our door within 3 minutes and took care of everything so I can't complain about that. Oh, but their shampoo/conditioner product was horrible! So, I do suggest you bring your own. I never had so many tangles in my life! Anyway, the location can't be beat...many stores and restaurants are located in very close proximity...some even walkable. There is a grocery store, a couple restaurants, and a nice ice cream parlour right behind the hotel. Unfortunately, this hotel doesn't have elevators, so be sure to request a ground floor if anyone in your party cannot do the stairs. Overall, I definitely plan to stay there again.

You are right down the street from the Downtown Disney entrance to the WDW Resort. This entrance has less traffic and is often easier to access than Maingate. You can also catch Disney Buses right at Downtown Disney if you like. Staybridge Suites is less than 2 minutes from this WDW entrance. This hotel is not fancy but we have always found it to be clean and comfortable. The layout of the suite is ideal as we are often traveling with friends. Each 2 bedroom suite has one room with a king bed and full bath and a second room with 2 double beds and a full bath. In addition, there is a small kitchen and living room. There is a full breakfast offered with both hot and cold food. Again, nothing fancy, but convenient and good. There is also a grocery store in easy walking distance. Our family has been making great use of that this week. The pool and spa are also good sized and clean. I would highly recommend this hotel to family's looking for a little more space and a terrific location. Only complaint we have had - or heard - is about the shuttles.

I requested weekend housekeeping and they said consider it done, so we had our maid service all eight nights. Our kids loved the pool, kiddie pool, fountain and hot tub almost to the point of annoyance because often they complained about touring the parks and just wanted to stay and swim! We stayed on the second floor overlooking the peaceful courtyard. This was convenient because when our kids would nap my husband and I could go down and play cards/read the paper/whatever and still keep an eye on our door. If we return, I would request the third floor however, because we could hear our upstairs neighbors plumbing and pipes in the morning while we were still in bed. The third floor would eliminate some of that noise. You can also hear people pretty clearly right outside your door. Some extra soundproofing would make this place even better.

An open plan kitchen area, a 3 seater sofa bed, a seperate chair and a dining table and chairs. The bedrooms are on opposite sides which is useful for some privacy! The main bedroom had a huge double bed, with en suite fittings, TV, hairdryer, free safe, iron, ironboard and alarm clock. The other bedroom had two small double beds, ensuite and TV but no hairdryer and no safe. Apart from that not much different. All rooms were clean to a good standard, it's not going to satisfy everyones tastes but it satisfied my wife and she is a stickler for cleanliness! Breakfast room was a good size with tables outside so that whatever time you went down there, it never felt crowded. A good variety of breakfast options, including make your own waffles. The waffle maker is in a seperate room to the other food options. You can have cereal (doesn't change) juices, coffee, tea and even beer! They also provide an egg option and a meat option if you want to. It does get tiresome after a while so we went to IHOP a couple of times. One thing they didn't have was peanut butter! The only spread options seemed to be Mixed fruit jelly, Grape and a few strawberry ones! (Had to hunt for those!) So we brought down our own PB which we brought from Walmarts! Overall though, it was a good breakfast spread. Pool is a bit on the small side. Put it this way, if there's more than 10 people in it, it feels crowded! Apart from that it's clean and you get plenty of sun. Pool area was clean and free towels were provided and also free balls and floating devices which I thought is a nice touch. We also used the laundry service which was ok, make sure you have plenty of quarters! Maid service was the minimal standard, they did come everyday including weekends which differs to what the notices say, and most of the time they tended to arrive between 4 and 5pm, which was an incovenience, especially when we came back from the parks early! They make the bed, give you clean towels and might put on the dishwasher but there's no hoovering at all and didn't appear to be any cleaning. I guess that is in the once a week full maid service! Whatever you do, do not use the phone! Very expensive to call the UK, I told my friends it wouldn't be cheap but they did it anyway and it cost them $130 for about 20 mins! So be warned!

Hotel is an ideal base for exploring Disney, theres a free shuttle bus to Hollywood Studios, Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdon and Epcot, providing pick up and return service at various times for each park. For Disney waterparks take advantage of using the DisneyWorld Transportation System from the parks which runs throughout Disney itself. We did have to get taxi's to Seaworld and Universal but the taxi's the hotel used were all very reasonable. Our suite itself was very adequate for what we needed, bathroom is a little bit small but the king size bed makes up for that! We did miss not having a kettle in the kitchen, there is a coffee maker but for tea lovers the boiling water from the coffee maker is not nice! Cleaning was adequate but do make use of the \"later please\" sign if you are looking for a lie in as the timings of the cleaner varied alot! The daily breakfast was good but did get a bit boring after a while as normally either scrambled egg and bacon or scrambled egg and sausage! The waffle station is great fun though and there was always a selection of cereals, juice, tea/coffee and pastries/cakes. The hotel does not have a drinks/snack bar or any alcohol beverages, except on Managers sundowner bar b q nights, which is a shame, however there are plenty of restaurants nearby - The Olive Garden is a fab Italian, Hooters is just a bit further to the left of the Olive Garden, TGI Fridays can be found on Crossroads place, and Joes Crabshack is just opposite the hotel. Most nights we were out at the parks anyway! The hotel has a lovely gated pool area where you can swim until 11pm - theres a pool and jacuzzi which is very welcoming on the feet after walking around parks all day. Plenty of sunbeds and towels provided too. The laundry room came in handy but one request i would make is for a folding airer in the suite as there is no where as such to hang your washing that you cant tumble dry! There is also free use of computers and internet for those of you who cant leave checking your emails whilst away!

One final point is that if you are booking this hotel through Thomson Holidays be aware that there is no Rep service at this hotel, we were given a number to call if we needed a Rep, which we did use as needed some details of pre booked excursions, however getting the Rep to come to us was not an easy process, Thomson didnt know who was covering the area and we ended up with a guy who normally covers Universal International Drive area, he didnt know where the hotel was so was over an hour late getting to us!!", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helen's Bay, N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA great family base for Disney\u201d", "Author": "saparker", "ReviewID": "UR16956812", "Content": "This is a great family base for a stay at Disney.

I got the impression that the staff were generally proud of the hotel. I take this as good sign. Location wise the suites are close to everything. One tip when going to the Disney parks other then Typhoon lagoon, Downtown Disney or Cirque is to go via I-4. There is a entrance to Disney less then a mile away via Hotel Plaza Blvd but having to stop for traffic light every couple of hundred meters put me off. There is a 24 hour Walgreen's right across the road from the hotel. There is a large walmart within 5-10 minutes drive. When you are coming out of the hotel on to the main road, turn left and drive straight for 2-3 miles it's on your right (pass under I-4). For what it is. A mid-range spacious family friendly suite complex that is comfortable and safe close to all the attractions, I would give this 5/5.

Our boys slept on the pull out just fine. They are 6 & 9 but if they were older we would have opted for the 2 bedroom. We only ate out \"nice\" one evening and twice lunch in Magic kingdom & Blizzard Beach. The rest of the time the kitchen came in handy and we were able to have snacks, drinks for the kids and for us adults grabbed some beer from winn dixie next door, and sandwich stuff for the rest of the time. The bathroom was a little cramped, it needed about another 2 feet of space in there. It also needed a new shower head, but I find that in most hotels. If they would just stick to a plain ole shower head and avoid the fancy shower massagers they would work better and longer. Other than that it got us cleaned just fine. Breakfast was pretty good and got us to a great start. Eggs, bacon or sasauge, yogurt & granola, cereal, juices, milk, coffee, soda, waffles, muffins, bagels. We arrived late and did not stay during there BBQ evenings but it sounded good. We did not realize how booked the hotel was until our last day when we decided to sleep in (9am). We like to get to the parks early. There were alot of eople at breakfast that day but everything flowed just fine. Pool was small but we were there for the parks not the hotel pool. There was also a hot tub. Very close to DT Disney (5minutes). Close to all of Disney. There was shuttle service to all of these. I did notice that animal kingdom had only one pick up and return but the rest had multiple times. Saved on parking fees! If you are going to universal there is no shuttle service, but I would reccomend a closer hotel to there anyways. I think there is another staybridge closer to that. The hotel staff was ALWAYS smiling and actually seemed like they liked their job. Very nice and willing to answer any questions. We used our reward points to stay but the price is resonable compared to other hotel in the area plus you get breakfast, a kitchen, some shuttle service, and a suite. We would definately stay here again even if we did not have points to used for our stay. Oh I have to tell you this....One day after going to the Magic Kingdom when we got back into our room, our room was not only cleaned but my son's favorite stuffed animal was proudly set up on the pull out bed waiting for him.

As well, the suites are nicely laid out and although they are not super large - they are more than enough room for a family of four. In fact, our 2 bedroom had a king size bed and 2 doubles, as well as 2 bathrooms, 3 T.V.'s, in-room safe and kitchen with full-size fridge, stove, m/wave, dishwasher and toaster. We found the rooms clean and nicely decorated/furnished. You can request a room right around the pool, but I don't know how noisy it might get (I think the pool is open quite late). Our room was still facing in towards the courtyard but was at the other end opposite the pool, and we liked that just fine as we could easily get to our parked car. However, even though the hotel was operating at full capacity, it was never noisy or overcrowded. Bear in mind there are no elevators, so if you bring a lot of luggage, you may not want to go higher than 2nd floor. The included buffet breakfast was deliciious! There's a waffle making station (yum!), and they always offer an egg dish (scrambled or omelette), meat (bacon, etc.),cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, coffee, OJ, and cake, donut or muffins. You can choose to eat either inside or out (or in your room!), and the outside courtyard area is very tranquil and pretty. The pool and surrounding area is large and has a tropical-like feel to it. The hotel has a handy business center as well with free Internet. There's also a manager's cocktail reception 2 or 3 nights a week (I think it was Tues, Wed & Thurs evenings) and the offerings are pretty generous. They had chicken wings, salad, veggies/dip, beer and wine one night when we were there. Overall, this is a great hotel for families, couples, friends - anyone who wants a clean, comfortable stay with a great buffet breakfast included. Excellent value for money - I'm very glad we chose this one.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cYikes, mold and mildew alert!\u201d", "Author": "TravellinwithFamily", "ReviewID": "UR16295684", "Content": "In preparing for my family's Orlando stay, I picked the Staybridge on the basis of many positive reviews.

The benefits of this hotel for us were its location, which is handy to WDW, many restaurants, a pharmacy, and supermarket (walking distance for all but WDW). Other value-added services included the buffet breakfasts, manager receptions (3 times weekly) guest laundry (nominal fee), complimentary newspapers and shuttles to shops and WDW, tidy pool area and grounds, and willingness of staff to respond to issues brought to their attention. The drawbacks we experienced was a room that desperately needed more regular maintenance prior to guest check-in. For example, we were met with carpets that turned our feet/socks black within moments of walking on them, a toilet that would not flush/drain consistently (2 maintenance calls during our stay alone, problem still occuring on check-out), a moldy/mildewed shower head, curtain (a fresh one provided on request), toilet tank filled with mold, a moldy air exchange system, and rumpled bedding that appeared \"enjoyed\" by the previous guests. We appreciate that cleaning staff in most major hotels have 20 minutes or less to prepare a unit for new guests to arrive, but if you have health issues, such as sensitivities to molds, mildews, or dust mites, this is probably a hotel you want to avoid until the management works out a better maintenance schedule. Think I am being too fussy? Check out what the Centre for Disease Control has to say about exposure to molds and mildews.

The furnishings were comfortable although not brand new (it is a hotel, after all). Everything was very clean. The morning breakfast was a step above the usual continental breakfast, serving eggs, bacon, self-made waffles, and fruit in addition to the usual fare of cereal, danishes, coffee, and juices.

Check out was automatic, not even needing a trip to the front desk. These folks know efficiency! The hotel is in walking distance to grocery and drugstores, and a few restaurants. Since it is located on the north side of I-4, it is on the same side of the highway as the Disney Parks. Access to the parks is quite easy without having to get in the middle of I-4 traffic or the Lake Buena Vista exit. Downtown Disney is a mile a way. My only complaint is very minor: the hallway areas were at times cluttered with trash bags from recently cleaned rooms. These were never left out for more than a couple hours but sometimes there were many. Also, the hallways could be littered with flyers from local restaurants that had been stuffed into doors and fallen on the floor.

The suite itself had 2 bedrooms (one massive king, the other 2 v.large doubles), 2 bathrooms and a kitchen with diswasher, cooker, full size fridge/freezer and microwave. No complaints at all about the space on offer, but it needed some updating: it was very tired, and the bathrooms in particular were very \"old\".

We did not use the shuttle system as we rented a car since we have small children and did not want to have to wait for a shuttle.

Trip Tip: Since we had planned to do the \"Disney Experience\" for several hours each day and then return midday to have lunch the location was great because there were restaurants off Disney grounds and the ability to do grocery shopping at the Winn Dixie immediately behind the hotel. This saved a lot of money for us, The breakfast buffet in the morning also provided a great selection of hot and cold menu items. Again, another great money-saving feature of the hotel. Although the hotel is not on Disney grounds this really was not a drawback. The hotel is within 2 to 10 miles from each Disney park. However, be careful because if you are looking for complete shuttle service to the Disney parks, this hotel does not have it. We opted to drive to the parks each day and pay the $10 parking fee, which ended up being much more compatible with our schedules of going back and forth to the parks when we wanted to.

The only downside for the whole stay was that there were no lifs, our room was on the first floor, so we had to cart our luggage up and down one flight of stairs. But the room was lovely. One bedroom had a king size bed and walk-in wardrobe, with safe. The other bedroom had 2 queen beds. Both bedrooms had an ensuite bathroom.

Free use of the computer station which was limited to adults only (which I feel is wonderful). Very nice to be able to check your emails and not have to pay $4 a minute. Kids had a computer that they could use in game room.I found the hotel to be overall very clean. The laundry room could use some help, but not disguisting.

I worried about some of the reviews I found here, but found they were substantually untrue when we got there.

We requested a first floor, quiet, recently renovated room and that is exactly what we got even though the hotel was booked full during the spring break period. Yes the breakfast was fine, nice to be able to eat right there in the sunshine before a day of battle at the parks. Room was clean and very spacious, we had only a single bedroom suite as we only had two adults and one small child, but really ample room to make things comfortable. We really didn't use the kitchen except the sink and the fridge, but everything worked and was well stocked, silverware, glassware, corkscrew, icemaker etc. We checked in early, checked out late, felt safe the whole time, things were quiet, staff friendly and helpfull. Common areas were nice and kept clean, same for the pool and the area around. The pool is not as big as it looks in photos online, but nice just the same as we didn't go when it was busy. I think the people who complain about the grade of cabinetry or how they found a speck of dirt here and there, or the maids hadn't done thier room every day by 1pm should get a grip. If you want first class luxury accomodations go to the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress ($190-$300 a night for 360 sq ft room), Ritz-Carlton Orlando Grande Lakes ($320-$500 a night per room), Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa ($400-$600 a night for 406 sq ft room). Keep in mind the above quotes are rooms, not suites so double these figures for suites or adjoining rooms. Maybe I am easy but it seems to me if you want a decent, clean, well maintained suite type hotel, right near Disney, serves free breakfast, that's inexpensive and you are able to look past the occasional flaw then this place is a good bet. If you want perfection at any price, try one of the above. If you want perfection at Staybridge Suites prices, stay home. BTW. I am not that easy, I am a platinum Priority Club member plenty of travel experience. On this trip we also stayed 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza Universal (Jr Suite Priority Club Level) and 5 nights at Disney's Grand Floridian (Lodge Concierge). Were they nicer you ask..... Yup. Did we pay a lot more for that level accommodation..... Yup, yes indeed we did. Would I go back to Staybridge Suites Lake Buena Vista?

The kids loved these. We had a two bedroom suite overlooking the pool. The room was as we requested, non-smoking. 3 televisions, 2 double beds in one room along with it's own bathroom and a whopping king size bed in master bedroom along with it's own bathroom and dressing room (which contained ironing board etc and safe). The sitting room/kitchenette was a good size. Room was clean and well decorated - some of the kitchen cupboards had marks but who cares I wasn't there to cook! The beds were made everyday along with the towels being replaced - the room was hoovered every few days. The only day the room wasn't done was the Sundays we were there which didn't bother us (if you put in a request the room will be done 7 days per week). There was always plenty of hot water for baths/showers and plenty of car parking space. There was a managers special three times a week (Tues through to Thursday 5.30-7.30) where there were such things as chicken wings, cookout with hotdog and burgers, soft drinks, wine beer. You can get coffee 24 hours a day from the machine in the dining room. The kids loved the pool and there are plenty of sunloungers and chairs, this shuts at 11pm, so any noise will be gone by the time you want to sleep. The hot tub is as it says hot, but welcome when your feet are killing you! There were always plenty of papers (local) in the lobby but we never had time to read them anyway. The business centre had 3 computers with internet access. The hotel is in an excellent location for restaurants - Sizzler, Black Angus, Shoneys, Steak 'n' Shake, Olive Garden, Burger King, IHOP to name a few. Winn Dixies and a Papa Johns pizza place is behind the hotel, Walgreens across the road. Also a couple of gift shops across the main road, also a petrol (gas) station. Post Office and a Sony shop is also across the road. What more can I say we really enjoyed the hotel and it's location.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limehouse, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4999059", "Content": "All I can say is Service, Service, Service!

The room was not dirtyon the surface, only when you looked more closely it just needed a good clean. Our room was on the top floor, which was not a problem as we were aware there was no lift and reception did offer for someone to help with our cases if we needed assistance. We actually liked our room at the front overlooking the lakes and found it very private up there. Would not have liked a room near the swimming pool area, due to noise in the evenings.

We were poolside, The floor space was great and newly decorated. Unfortunatly the kitchen let the suite down. The cabinets were chipped and water damaged, you could scrape grease off the hand grips and front doors of the lower cabinets. the hinges were rusty and caked in dirt. The microwave had dirt in the door and old food in the seams inside. The air conditioning vent in the living room was filthy and some of the furniture was soiled. In one of the bathrooms the handbasin was cracked and again the cabinets water damaged. My first complaint met with a promise of deep cleaning the next day, that wasn't done so on day 3 I asked to be moved. Was told a room was coming available that day so to repack all our cases and take our valuables out with us that day. After packing when we went to ask for a safety deposit box were told the room wasn't available after all and to come back that evening(wasted morning at the parks). The only rooms they could offer us were in the walkways between the buildings looking onto of the wall with large air conditioning vents outside the bedroom windows. Not ideal for a 14 night stay at $159 a night! Advised to ask at reception each night for next day availability. Was told the manager only worked 11am til 5pm (not true). So wrote to her and was offered the room we rejected a couple of days before. During the second week the kitchen was cleaned and checked by the manager. Other than the air vent and door grips you couldn't have told. Didn't actually use the kitchen during our stay.If we hadn't paid in advance I would have moved on.

Its position is good for Disney,the facilities and communal areas were good, breakfast a bonus and apart from two of the receptionists, staff were very pleasant.

The sundowner was also very good with a limited choice. The pool was very good and open till late, it was nice after a long day at Disney etc, you did not need your own towels at the pool as they were also provided.

The air-conditioning was very welcome as the temps were in the late 90's you could adjust the setting for your own comfort. At the back of the suites is a supermarket this sells everything you need if you want to cook yourself.

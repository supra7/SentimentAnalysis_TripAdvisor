{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel Great, Service Poor We stayed at this hotel because we had a Softball tournament in Slidell. The Hotel was clean and very nice. We experienced poor service over all. Our team traveled 11 hours to Louisiana and on our first morning for breakfast, we were rushed to eat and leave. We had one parent that came in at 2 am and had to wake up and have breakfast before 9 am. Most La Quinta's breakfast is over at 10. This one was taking food away before 9. One parent was at the waffle maker with at least two or three people waiting, the lady told them to hurry because she was going to take the machine away. Every time we made a request, they seemed bothered to do it.The other thing is that the only restaurant close by is IHOP and McDonalds. There is nothing else in site.", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551933993", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SoftballMom07"}, {"Content": "A reasonable hotel We got very decent rates thru Hotels on the NewYears Eve weekend 2004-2005 (~$50). The hotel offers average and basic comforts. Refrigerator, iron, microwave, coffeemaker, etc. The room is spacious, but it had a damp smell in it. Bath towels were not of good quality. The hotel employees were not very good choice, we saw the attendents, just shouting and playing around in the corridors even when guests were around. The office staff were friendly and helpful.The location of the hotel was perfect for us, just 10 mi away from all the action, if you do not mind the short drive. But for the money we saved during the NewYears, it was well worth it. But otherwise, I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR712254798", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "teekays"}, {"Content": "No problems here I stayed at the LaQuinta on Bullard Nov. 4-6,2004. It was very quiet. The only noise that I heard at night was the heat coming on because it was chilly that weekend. I had no problems, but the hotel could use a little updating (tub was water stained, and the wall paper was tired looking). The staff was helpful when I needed them, which wasn't often because I was out of the room all day and into the night for my entire stay. I really liked having free parking, a premium in the NOLA area. Access to the I10 service road made it fast and easy to get to attractions in NOLA, and the easy access to I10 made it easy to get to Baton Rouge and Cajun Country.", "Date": "Dec 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR941286747", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Avoid La Quinta Bullard We stayed at this hotel July 1-3, 2003 Confirmation number LQ0072183944I had the most miserable night of my life in this hotel. The room next door turned into Party Central. At least 15 people were staying (or partying) in the room next door. Incidentally, the smoke was very strong coming from this non-smoking room.Three calls to the front desk did nothing. At 2 am I demanded another room. A security guard (Ollie) grudgingly- helped me, my daughter and my sister carry our luggage upstairs to another room (no elevator). He rudely told me in no uncertain words he didn't work for the hotel and moving luggage wasn't his job! I felt that if he had done his job we wouldn't have had to move! In fact, I later saw and heard him laughing with two girls from the party room next door. I asked him where his interests were and he told me the girls offered him a drink but he told them he couldn't drink on the job.Another guest threatened me and my daughter in the front lobby when we went to get the key- told us to mind our own business. I replied that my only business was trying to sleep. The hotel clerk watched this incident and did nothing. I called a headquarters number in their brochure (1-800-531-5900) at 1:30 am and spoke with Rolando. Rolando sounded very concerned and said he would follow up on the situation. I gave him my cell and home phone numbers. Surprise, surprise- I never heard a thing!We felt very unsafe in this motel. I even called the police around 1:30 am and asked for an officer to come by.The desk clerk (Danille)and security guard were absolutely useless. We didn't sleep until 3 am. The next morning when we checked out, the manager apologized. He was very nice, but he wasn't there when needed and his people were incompetent. I will avoid this particular motel at all costs and I doubt I will every stay in a La Quinta Inn in the future!It's ironic that this motel was recommended by Triple A and the Triple A agent actually made this reservation for me. I am sending them a copy of this complaint as well.Jeanne Bates", "Date": "Jul 20, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR251382784", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d93132-r18356005-La_Quinta_Inn_New_Orleans_Bullard-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "93132", "Price": "$62"}}

I did not get to visit the bar on this trip. The room was quiet, updated and had very comfortable beds. We ordered room service for a late dinner and the food and service was great! The entire staff was polite and professional! Now the negatives....the parking garage allowed easy access to the hotel but they slam you with a 26 dollar fee. You are given a stub that allows you to come and go as you please. The second problem is they charge you a fee to use the Internet. This is ridiculous! The third and last problem I had was that I had to leave the ballgame early because I have young kids. When I got back to the room, I found out that I could not watch the game in my room, as they do not provide local programing for the Orioles games. Horrible!

Rooms were fine, hotel was clean and nice although the cleaning staff did not clean some of the volleyball girls room for any of the three days we were there. However, the concierge was friendly and helpful in recommending a restaurant when most were booked and in helping us to get a large reservation. This hotel is much much better than the Days Inn Inner Harbor which we stayed at two years ago so I would stay again. But I do think the hotel should do a little more to make their guests feel safe in returning to the hotel and not being accosted by a homeless person. Also, one other complaint: pillows were either the giant decorative pillows or they were extremely small and mushy.

One, the fan in my room just would not shut off (a/c, heat, whatever). Usually if the fan noise is bothering me I can just turn it off; with this one, no matter what I did it wouldn't stop. I went as far as looking for a cord so I could unplug the damn thing. I ended up having to use earplug to get to sleep for three nights in a row. I mentioned this to some other people attending the conference with me, and several of them mentioned this was an issue in their room as well. So if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs! The only other complaint I have is that the meeting rooms in this hotel got extremely cold. I'm no stranger to conferences, so it was a surprise to have to wear my coat and scarf during conference sessions. Not sure if it's just the time of year, but it definitely made some of the meetings uncomfortable (and we had men getting cold too, so it was not just us warm-blooded women).

I did an initial visit for just one day in 2009, and stayed for a full 7 days in November 2010. I was extremely impressed with their entire staff, from upper management, to front desk, catering, and housekeeping. The concierge is very helpful and has lots of information on transportation (FREE bus line!), local shopping and restaurants. It is a 10 minute walk or 5 minute free bus ride to the Inner Harbor, which is lovely and has great shopping. You can go visit the Edgar Allan Poe memorial and grave just blocks away - on foot or there is ample street parking by the little cemetery and church. The property is also adjacent to the University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore Convention Center, and Camden Yards. My room was an executive suite, which i could have lived in comfortably for an extended period. It was very well laid out for business and/or pleasure. The property is very clean and up to date, as well as being well appointed with high-end amenities. There is a nice view of the Inner Harbor area via the wall of huge windows in each room. I loved the updated shower, but it must be noted that they do not have a bathtub, if that's your thing. The parking is a bit of a hassle - it is expensive and you have to arrange for in/out privileges. Not too bad for those accustomed to downtown city parking, but perhaps a hassle for others. The meeting space is excellent and conveniently in its own wings so as not to create traffic jams with the kitchen or sleeping rooms. The hospitality staff is EXCELLENT. I work all over the country in all types of meeting space and these people are in the upper echelon as far as training, expertise and people skills go. The food is very good - better than many other Marriotts in the same class. If you want something different, try Frank and Nic's West End Grill a half block away. You can't go wrong with any menu item, they are open late, and the staff is fun and efficient. If you feel like a happy hour that lasts an eternity and some regular pub fare, hit Pickles Pub just a block further away. I drank $1 Peronis for three hours there and met some fun people. I didn't have time or energy for the fitness center, but it looked brand new and state of the art, even if it was a little small. We had a great group rate that i negotiated, but their rack rate seems in line as well. Overall, this is a great property for the money and very convenient to many local attractions.

The location is, as other's have said, about a mile from the actual inner harbour, but I didn't mind the walk and it's a nice one. I have two major complaints about this hotel. The first is that they nickle and dime you for everything, internet access, coffee, parking, etc. The second is that the beds here were possibly the worst I have slept on EVER in my entire life. It was like sleeping on a very very very porous sponge. I commented on the beds before my roommate got into his. He rolled his eyes and called me a drama queen. Then he went to bed. All I heard was \"oh, wow!\" as he sunk to the floor.

Having stayed at the Inner Harbor area in the past we felt more at ease staying there than in an area of Baltimore that may not be as \"good\". Rates for hotels in the area run high so I went on Priceline and secured this hotel at a very attractive $70.00 per night. Checking in was a breeze. They honored my requested for double beds and allowed 3 in the room, no problem. Parking is $24.00 per DAY. Once the ticket has been validated by the front desk you are able to take the car in and out of the garage all day with no additional charge. The room was not the biggest Marriott hotel room I have been in, however we had 2 queen size beds, a desk with free wireless high speed internet, coffee service, flat screen tv etc. The beds were extremely comfortable, and not a bed bug in sight. (of course I checked, I'm from NY) Once we were settled in, we had no problem finding a cab to the Inner Harbor which is 10 blocks away. It was late afternoon, I have MS, and different legs at different times of day, lol, so we chose a cab. It was $5.00 with tip. Once there we were able to walk around the Harbor, and hopped another cab to Fells Point which took less than 10 minutes and $8.00 from the Inner Harbor. Fells Point was great. A bag piper was playing on the steps of town square to serenade people on and off the water taxis from the Inner Harbor. An Orioles double header had been in full swing, cheers and jeers bursting out of the bars as we walked by. Fells Point is a young, urban area, with a decidedly historic feel. Great little shops, restaurants, and bars galore. We hailed another cab back (legs) to the hotel to pick up my daughter who had been sleeping soundly behind our double locked doors AND the key card enabled locked glass doors that block entrance to the hotel rooms unless you have a key to that hallway! Nice touch Marriott! That cab ride was approx $10.00 for the longer ride to Camden Yards. Still reasonable! (My husband says he should have taken out the car...of course, Dear) Finally, we went back to the Inner Harbor for dinner at Phillips Restaurant for Crab Cakes etc. They were good. The service was great. My daughter was developing a sinus infection. Our server went out into the food court and BOUGHT her Tylenol with her own money. That was above and beyond and very much appreciated. Once we checked out this morning, enjoyed breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Actually, I did not want their breakfast buffet, but from the moment we walked in 3 people asked or suggested that we would be having the buffet. By the time the waitress came over to pour the coffee and hand us the menus, she said, \" we have the breakfast buffet\"....and I said \"which I guess everyone wants us to choose vs ordering from the menu?\" and she explained that you can't possibly get this much food for $17.50 anywhere, and it's so good. Guess what we ordered???? And you know what? I ordered 2 eggs over easy. And they were the best eggs I have had out ever. They had biscuts in a beef gravy...I can't begin to describe how delicious that was. My husband had french toast that I could smell as I walked up to the table. He ate every last bite. This was the kind of buffet you hope for but NEVER find. Well, now you know, it's at the Marriott Camden Yards!!!! Shhhh don't tell anyone... One last note, some other reviewers knocked the service at this hotel. That was not our experience at all. And let me tell you, I ask for directions everywhere, for everything. And I forget alot of things. Well, you get the picture. I come in contact with a lot of people. They were always very courteous, helpful, wrote directions for us more than once, printed tickets, arranged for wake up calls, and really extended themselves on every level. Bravo Camden Marriott!

The property is just a bit tired compared to the Hilton and other full-service Marriott properties in which I've recently stayed. On the up side, the service was great. My room was cleaned twice daily - once during the day and every evening when I was out for dinner. It was as if they were waiting for me to leave and ran in to clean the room while I was gone. Very impressive. The food in the hotel was pretty good and the staff was super nice. The gentleman who checked me in remembered me by name five days later when I needed a key to my room. I was disappointed that I wasn't upgraded to a suite (picky, I know) but they were all contracted out to the convention. I'd stay there again if I was going to an Orioles game, but only because I'm so loyal to Marriott. If brand wasn't such a big deal to me, I'd be at the Hilton.

Given that a few (about 4) blocks away, there is the beautiful Baltimore Inner Harbor, I may stay in a hotel near there for similar price and comfort but with a view! Secondly, if not for a view, why stay in this area? Why not near BWI and simply take the light rail to downtown. That would be easier in terms of parking as well.

I might accept it as a Courtyard, but no way does it approach full Marriott quality. The fitness area is small, and the pool appears permanently closed. No pool, no hot tub ... those are simply automatic amenities with a full Marriott, and this hotel doesn't have them. (Some staff believes the pool may reopen, others have heard it's being remodeled into banquet space.) The restaurant and room service prices are at least as high as a full Marriott in a top-tier city, and the $12.95/night Internet and the parking fees (I believe $25) are heavy duty. But the rooms are small, the climate control is a noisy Ramada-style wall unit that's controlled by a thermostat, the mini-bar had apparently been disabled (handle gone, door glued shut) ... but it east half of the dresser space, so there's very little storage (at least in sixth-floor rooms). A wall socket was apparently spliced to fit a bump-out in the wall, so the face place is about two-thirds as wide as normal, with a rough-cut edge down one side. Is that big stuff? No, but again - it's simply not Marriott quality. Gene the concierge is beyond outstanding - if you go, you really want to say hello. He's cheerful and upbeat, as are a couple of the doormen and at least one of the desk clerks. But most of the desk staff we encountered was bored/brusque, and the check-in clerk was way, way more interested in confirming whether I was a Marriott rewards member than in answering questions about the hotel. Clearly, this hotel gets a lot of business from the ballpark, and I'm guessing there's a disproportionate percentage of children/familes/budget travelers compared to a regular Marriott.

Well within walking distance. Checking in was a breeze. We arrived at about 4:30 on Friday and our room was ready when we got there. We asked for an upgrade to the concierge level, which was immediately granted because of our Elite Member status. The service at the hotel was very good. Everyone was pleasant and helpful from the front desk, to the bellhops, to the room service people. No issues whatsoever. Our room was extremely clean. No issues with mold in the bathroom, stains on the carpet, etc. Furniture was in good condition and the TV was a nice sized flat panel LCD TV. Beds were very comfortable (as always at Marriott). All the other typical amenities were present (as expected). Breakfast was included in our room rate and we ordered room service both days due to convenience. It was delivered hot and on time both occasions. Room service accidentally added these meals to our bill, but the front desk immediately fixed this once I brought it to their attention. The one complaint I read that was true was regarding the safe not working. We also experienced this and tried to have it fixed, but engineering never got to it. Apparently many of the rooms (ours not included) were having air conditioning issues. We found this out from an engineering department staff member we ran into in the hallway. This was not a huge concern. We just ended up carrying our limited valuables with us instead. The concierge helped us with reservations at a restaurant we wanted to go to and got us a free shuttle ride there. He also gave us one adult and one student ticket for their brand new Sports Hall of Fame near Camden Yards, for free. Parking in the garage was added to our room bill and worked out well for us since we were able to leave our car parked in the garage on Sunday well after we checked out, giving us time to still mill around the Inner Harbor without having to take the car and find new parking.

At check-in I was greeted by a clerk who did not welcome me, did not acknowledge my Marriott Rewards status and was simply overall unhelpful, surly, and possibiliy uninformed. It was 1:00pm and my king room was not ready. I asked if some other accomodation could be identified as I needed to leave for work within the hour and would be working until late at night. I needed to get settled. No. Nothing. Nothing. No offer to even check. I returned to the desk within 2 minutes to confirm that they had my Rewards # (vaguely thinking that might make a difference). A different, older woman helped me and asked for my room #. I told her I didn't have one yet - and she looked at me with a very puzzled expression. She immediately offered my a double room, which I accepted and I was checked in in short order - with a welcome gift for Elite members. I was greeted as such as well and welcomed back. Night and day to the other gal. All I can think is that the first gal either needs re-training, doesn't care or some combination. The rooms - and the hotel overall for that matter - are VERY dated and in strong need of update. The room has wallpaper that I recall from Marriotts at least 10 years ago. When I returned to my room in the evening the TV remote was not functioning and a call to \"At your service\" to request help with the remote and order dinner - was another excursion into the land of indifference. The gal on the phone barely answered \" At your Service\" - the proper greeting would have included my name and a \"good evening\". I cheerily identified myself...no response...asked how this indiviual was ...What can I do for you? I told her I had several requests. I started with the remote...silence on the line...I said, So you'll be sending someone up...yes - you said you had several requests...Im waiting to hear the Rest!! yikes. I ordered dinner and a corkscrew. Dinner arrived very propmptly with a pleasant server - without a corkscrew. he returned promptly however and in the meantime the remote man arrived and solved the problem. Very hit and miss but my overall perception is that the staff are indifferent and the hotel is in need of revitalization. I don't doubt that will happen given the primo location and the new hilton going up across the street. This place is probably barely ok for a conference or a ball game but I wouldn't stay here again.

I was in Baltimore for a conference and I choose this hotel because of its proximity to the convention center and the Inner Harbor.

I handed my luggage and laptop to the bellhop and he gave me a tag for the luggage and an orange security tag for my laptop. I was very impressed with that little detail, as it implied that they were taking some kind of responsibility for my laptop. I then left to find the Convention Center which turned out to be less than 2 blocks away. The Harbor is just a couple more blocks down Pratt. The location was absolutely perfect. After grabbing lunch at the Harbor, I walked back to check on my room although the pager had not yet gone off.

The bed is a firm, yet pillowy mass of cool down comforters and great big fluffy/firm pillows that I sank into for a nap as soon as I put my bags down and surveyed the room. It was truly one of the best naps I've ever taken. And that night's sleep was even better. The hotel does offer a catalogue that sells their bedding and linens but it's way too expensive for me.

My most recent visit was unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. The room was very nice, the bed being the high point. Marriott bedding is truly beyond compare and one of the reasons we prefer Marriott. The room's floor, however, was filthy. I don't know whether the dark carpeting makes for less attention but though not immediately discernible to the naked eye, our socks showed proof of this after a relatively short amount of time. The bathroom was adequate, though nothing special. It was the little things that made this particular stay question staying here in the future. It started with not being recognized (as is usually the custom) at check-in as a Silver member. I don't need to be recognized as such for my own self-worth or anything like that, but it was just an interesting indicator of the level of attention to come. I had booked this stay as a \"Romance Package\" which included champagne and breakfast for two. The champagne never materialized, and breakfast was an adventure, to say the least. For starters, it was charged to my bill (despite the package) and only through haggling with the front desk was it taken off the bill. Secondly, the breakfast experience in Cafe Promenade has definitely gone downhill. A fork presented to me was filthy and when I complained it was handled nonchalantly. The buffet food is middling at best - though on previous trips, cooked-to-order items have been very good. I'm at a crossroads with this Marriott.

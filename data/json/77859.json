The room was clean which was the most important thing for me. We had 2 double beds plus TV with cable, a fridge, a desk, and night stand. The shower was super powerful and there was enough closet space for the two of us. Brand new secure locks on all the doors and the transients clear out early in the day. I still adore the location and price. There were slight little things like the last time I stayed there was almost like a mosquito screen across the window. There wasn't this time and something bit me after we left the window open. However, without the screen we were able to hang out of our 10th floor window for some great photos. If you looked closely, there was a stain on the wall and the chair looked like a puppy had teethed on the legs. Nothing major, though; just little cosmetic things. Oh, and there was the weird guys who would sit in reception all day and then stare at us as we walked by. Classy. There's only one thing stopping this from being a five star review. On day 9, my friend confessed she had been killing roaches in the bathroom for about 3 days. I was fully aware there would be roaches and I'm actually fine with this. We went down to the front desk to get some bug spray so I could defend myself but when we told the guy on the front desk, his response was \"what do you want me to do about it?\" I would have liked it if he had at least feigned surprise at the roach infestation but of course he was fully aware of the problem and a bad actor... His friend then came over to the front desk and started going on about \"this is why Brits shouldn't be allowed off the island\". They both told me that roaches were clean and I should be happy they were there (ugh). The front desk guy then had the nerve to ask my friend for a cigarette! I was so angry. He said he would go and have a look for some Windex after his cigarette and give me a call. I'm still waiting... His attitude was awful. He did actually apologise to my friend on our last night at the hotel and said he had to look big in front of his \"homies\" (I actually don't know what that means but I don't think it justifies such disrespectful behaviour). Again, for the price, I wont argue.

It's probably a good thing I was not sober checking in after the first nights show. Check in was easy, elevator dirty, got too our room and no air on. Turned on the wall unit and it did cool down. Our room faced the side parking lot (10th floor) so it wasn't noisy. I have been in dirtier places....this place is old. So beds old, linens old. towels old, bathrooms old. For the most part as old and worn as it was I think it was about as clean as it could get. Housekeeping was helpful and did their best. Bartender was not nice (on multiple nights) and I wouldn't spend a dime no matter how cheap it was in there. I did attach a picture(s) of \"something\" that was \"drawn\" on the wall bewtween the 2 beds when we arrived. Yes shocked at first - now it's just a good story to tell friends when they ask how my weekend in LA was. Area was pretty safe, very dirty, lots of rats. I counted 12 walking from the Stillwell to the Shell and back. If you stay here you will come out with a great story. If your partying down town this will do it, bed, shower, fridg., ice, and AC.

It was dirty. even the front lobby was disgustingly dirty. We stayed on the tenth floor. I thought the elevator was going to fall the whole ride up. It was a small, crowded, rickety junk bucket elevator. Then we get to the room - the locks hardly work. There was two twin beds and the entire place was very old and looked absolutely filthy (matted dirty carpeting, scuffed walls, dusty curtains). Neither my boyfriend nor I felt comfortable walking around barefoot, not even on the beds. we slept on top of the sheets, on the bed furthest from the door. The bathroom was disgusting as well - it had that scary haunted look, the toilet did NOT flush, the showerhead did NOT work (unless you call droplets of water slowly dripping out working) and on top of that the shower drain was clogged. And the worst part - we locked ourselves out of the room on our way out for the night, so when we returned we asked the front desk for a set of spare keys to the room. Which they gave to us. without checking our IDs. or verifying that we lived in that room. So in essence, anyone can walk up to the front desk and get a key to any room and break in. yeah, really safe. In the future i'd rather pay more for safety and cleanliness.

The reviews here are at best mixed so i was unsure about this place. I found that the room and the washroom was clean and adequate for my purposes. I got some noise from the street (i was on the 8th floor) but that didn't really bother me. This was my first time in LA and i had heard about how unsafe downtown is. A reviewers comments on how unsafe it was did not help. I was pleasantly surprised to find that downtown was not half as unsafe as i thought it would be. I felt that there were perhaps only a few more homeless people proportionally than i would find here in Toronto, Canada. I also walked around at odd hours of day and night and although downtown is deserted after dark, i did not find it unsafe. I found that the staff were not overly friendly but they were quite functional as in they called me when the tour van arrived, called cabs for me and kept my valuables and luggage (at no cost). So i cannot complain about that. The comment about the Indian restaurant is perhaps somewhat valid. I love the odd curry but the whole lobby smelled like the restaurant. Although once inside the elevator, it was fine. The hotel is defintely handy. I was in LA for 5 days and did not need to rent a car. I walked to the places downtown (Library, LA Symphone orchestra building, Modern Art gallery - all excellent), took the Metro on a couple of occasions (under 10 min walk from the hotel) and cabbed a couple of times. A subway is not too far away, and a department store is 10 min walk as well. So it is difficult to complain about the location. What i do not know, i found difficult to find and would be useful to know is that for a similar price (US$ 55) what are the other places in the vicinity and how do those places compare. That information would be useful to have and will be appreciated.

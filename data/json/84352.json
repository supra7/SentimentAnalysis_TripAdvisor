I would NOT recommend this hotel for anyone, but families especially should beware. The floors were moldy, dirty and constantly wet (even the carpets in the rooms.) There is no way I would let my small children crawl or walk on these floors. The interior of the hotel appears to have suffered extensive water damage, that has never been repaired. The walls in our room were stained, and their were large stickers on several surfaces. There was a hole in the bathroom door that, instead of being patched, simply had duct tape over it. The bathroom towels showed considerable signs of wear. The bathtub did not seem to be sufficiently supported from below. The shower itself took a remarkable amount of strength to turn on, I'm sure they were never upgraded. The mildewy shower curtain only had one sheet, which stuck to your body as you bathed, making it difficult to feel clean. The beds were also a disapointment, I found a short and curly hair on my pillow. The mattresses and sheets have likely never been replaced. Furthermore, there was not a clock radio in the room. While there was a TV, there was quite a bit of signal interference, so watching it was difficult. The dresser drawers, which we hoped to unpack our suitcases into, were filthy , covered in dust and hair. Perhaps the most alarming aspect of our stay was the discovery that the door connecting our room and the adjacent room was unlockable. We found a piece of duct tape that was meant to keep the door from being opened, which was hanging limply off the door frame. It is infuriating that we were not warned about this, as we had valuables in the room, as well as concern for our own safety. We ended up having to drag the table in front of the door. The deadbolt to the front door of our room was faulty as well. The elevators are to be avoided if possible. A fellow visitor informed me that her mother got stuck in the left elevator for 25 minutes earlier in their stay. The buttons to call for the elevator didn't work, and neither did the floor number lights inside. The outdoor pool had soda cans, trash, and dirt in it, athough it had been cleaned by the 3rd day.The front lobby area had no AC, and the doors into the lobby could only be opened by pulling the heavy \"automatic\" doors apart by their handles. The cleaning ladies were all very friendly, as was MOST of the frontdesk staff. The fire alarm pull looked damaged beyond repair, as if the plastic had been melted somehow. All in all, my frustrations with this place would not be so numerous had the place been sanitary. I can handle old, dated hotels for a cheap price, but dirty is never acceptable. I'll never stay here again, definetly not worth the cheaper rates.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cNegative\u201d", "Author": "MandS0923", "ReviewID": "UR132750551", "Content": "This place was so bad, I don't know where to begin. The outside awning was torn in areas, the building needs a complete exterior wash and paint, and the automatic front doors did not work. You had to open and close them yourself. The first front desk clerk we dealt with was rude. The hallways were smelly and the elevator semi worked. We used the stairs not only because it was faster, but slightly safer. The concrete stairs smelled like urine with holes and divots. The carpets were old, dirty, and smelly. I advise wearing shoes when going through the indoor pool desk due to the decay of the rocks. We did not use the outdoor pool but the lounge chairs were sufficient. The outside pool deck was dirty and could use a good pressure cleaning. The room itself had a hint of Febreeze to cover the moldy odor. Shotty patch jobs from the holes in the walls and doors. There were petrified boogers on the walls. The room and hotel in general had a roach issue. The bathroom faucet only worked when turned on all the way and the shower needed 'elbow grease' to work. The tv only had 7 channels in which 2 of them were fuzzy w/ rolling screens and the remote was broken. No microwave, phone, wi-fi, or fitted bed sheet. One lamp and one outlet worked throughout the entire room. The fridge was old and rusty and made a lot of noise. The fold-out couch was nasty and stained with a large hole in it. The sliding glass door opened partially and needed force to get it open that much. The outside AC unit's grill had fallen off to expose the rust and decomposition of the eqipment. A low-grade tropical storm came through on our last night. This was the WORST of the entire experience: we were the only tenants on the 3rd floor (we found this out afterwards). I started to hear a strange fast beeping sound which I thought was part of the movie we were watching and 20 minutes after the movie was over, it still beeped. I opened my room door and went down the hall and it stopped. When I went back to my room, it started again. My husband did the same thing. We both went downstairs to say something and she told us that no alarms were flashing from her area. We went back up to the room and it happened again. There was also eerie banging and howling in the hallways. Needless to say, we packed up within 2 minutes and checked out immediately. Due to the storm, we had to stay at another hotel. It was the absolute WORST hotel I have ever stayed. The only positive thing I have to say is that the housekeeping staff was pleasant and the towels smelled like coconuts. I have had some poor experiences at other hotels but none to this length. I do not recommend this place at all!! Please just pay the extra $20/night and get yourself a decent place to stay.

No free wifi...unless u r bright house network user. Paid 3 hrs for 4 dollars I opened the door to the room...the light didnt work, then, when I look at the place, it was a nightmare, it's the room u see in scary movie--huge noisy fridge, old desk with people writting on that--from 2001!...on the wall, there is a name and 03, god I felt like someone dead there. The curtains cannot be closed well, the remote control doesn't work, a dead roach under the sink, the fan in the bathroom was under there too! There was a hole on the ceiling where the fan was, and more, u can tell that someone broke in the room before since the door frame was glued together!! The lights near the bed was no even plugged in, and the thing made me so scared was the phone was not even working--actually there was no button left on it!!! Can anyone stay at a place like that...??? Besides, when I walked in the door, I started to cough and sneeze, the mold smell was gross... There is nothing I recommend for this place, even the price--not for 44usd for that dump. I didn't know that was only 44, since Expedia told me it was 60. The funny thing was that when we decided to leave after 10mins in the room, we gave back the key to the guy--not the same girl checked us in--in front desk, and we said we cannot stay here. He didn't even ask why, he just replied \"yes\" then that was all it... I guess it's normal that people checked out right after they checked in?

It could have been coming from the dirty walls and carpet, or it could have been the fridge that had not been wiped out, or it could have been the box of dinner left in the microwave from the previous guests. We're still not sure where it came from. The first thing you see when driving up to the hotel is the landfill of garbage. Apparently they do not have trash collection. The outdoor pool had not been cleaned. It was full of grass and cigarette butts. The pathway leading to the beach was covered in broken glass. I mean it was EVERYWHERE. They have furniture randomly thrown against the window in one room that is on the first floor. It looks really classy, let me tell you. Overall, the staff was pretty nice when we told them we just couldn't stay in their filthy hotel. We were only checked in for half an hour, but they could only give us half of the money back.

The hotel was far from what was shown on the website. The only good things about the place were, the sheets on the beds were clean and the ocean view was great. There were stains on the carpets, so bad my wife wouldn't walk on them without shoes. The kitchen area was gross and the fully equipped kitchen (no microwave) only had a couple of pots and pans, no utensils and there was something disgusting growing in one pot under the sink. Bugs (or something) had been smashed on the walls and never cleaned up. The fold out couch was a wreck (ripped, stained and uncomfortable). We tried to change our reservations on the day we arrived, but the manager would not work with us because we booked on line. The only ice machine was on the 8th floor and it was broken or out of ice. The second night (Friday) the noisey guests on our floor got unruley at about 3:00 am. At 4:30 we tried to call the desk and found that the phone didn't have a cord to the wall outlet. When I used my cell phone to call the desk, I had to leave a message. At 6:00 am we confronted the desk clerk and his solution was to give us a cord for the phone. No action what so ever was taken by the management to reslove the rowdy guests, infact we were told that we should have called the police (I assumed that was their responsibility). On Saturday morning both elevators were a mess, with one having pop spilled in it and the other having a booze bottle (750ml size that was full) broken on the floor, glass everywhere. Management was told at 6:00 and the mess was still there at 8:00. Upon checkout we complained to the manager, she told my wife that she was mentally handicapped and that she wasn't going to work with us on the complaint. She said that it was spring break and we should have gone to another hotel. She didn't give us a receipt when we checked out.

The couch that they put in the room had rips and burn holes in it. The comforters that they put on the beds also had rips and burn holes. We found an ash tray behind one of the beds that still had cigarettes in it from previous guest. The roof was falling down and not to mention the fact that mold was growing everywhere.

The elevator didn't work properly and when you got on it with other guest not one of them had anything remotely decent to say about their stay. We actually witnessed one couple leave and check out because it was gross. The phone in the room didn't work at all we had to go down to the office to say anything to them. The alarm clock didn't work and neither did a couple of the lamps that were in the room. The TV and the A/C only worked when they wanted to. We were so hot and felt so nasty that we could not even sleep. One of the people we brought with us actually sleep on the couch cause they thought that it would be safer than the bed but they ended up with bites on their back from laying on the couch.

I would not recommend taking a toddler or small child that would want to sit or crawl on the floor because it would not be clean enough for them. The pools were not bad and it definatly had enough chlorene in them to kill anything that would hurt you. Be sure to take your own towels they are very stingy about them and I have the feeling they don't have alot of them to give out. Also, bring your own sheets because it's a little sketchy, ours were clean but I can see where they might not have enough to really wash them everyday.

Every single room I have been in has been immacualate- upon arrival and when I get to the room at night. Housekeeping does a great job! They have a breakfast they serve every morning and it is good, they have fresh fruit, yougurt, homade waffles, scrambled eggs, various muffins and toast. Dry cereal and juices are available as well. The coffee is my morning savior! Every morning that I have been there, they have plenty of people in the breakfast area eating so for those previous reviews who said the food was terrible, it can't be too bad! Plus just for the record, it's not! As far as guest services go, the staff has been nothing but extraordinarily nice and helpful. Again, not sure what happens with every customer, but at this Comfort Inn the staff is great! Alex, goes ABOVE and BEYOND to make the guests feel welcome and make sure they enjoy their stay. They are always avaiable if you need anything; extra pillows, blanket, or just a wake-up call. I have not gone swimming here, but from my room I can see the pool and exercise area and I see people swimming and working out! So again, I do not know what was happening when ChipAnnDale were there but the Pool looks very inviting to me! So, overall this experience at Comfort Inn-West at Indianapolis has been a good one. I definately reccomend this hotel if you are in the Indy area and need to be close to the airport.

We were told, \"there had been a water leak.\" Yet we noticed that many of windows on the play area had been papered over and that there was a bunch of dust on the others.

By the vending machines, baseboards and trim were falling off the walls, for example. In our room, one of the comforters on the bed was ripped; on the other bed, the dust ruffle was ripped half the way down the bed. In the shower, the shower curtain had blood on it...yuck! We called, asking for a replacement one and were told, \"I'm the only one here and there's no one to install it...blah, blah, blah.\" After looking at the breakfast (I am a manager at a restaurant), we chose to not eat there; our experiences in the rest of the motel had us even questioning whether it was safe to eat there...we picked up food outside the facility. The place looked very little like the photos showed. When we asked for the manager, he told us they had no control over the photos on the website. While he apologized for the experience, he gave no explanation for it and simply handed us our receipt and said good bye. In the end, we paid $140 (including tax) for a $50 property.

I read the reviews prior to our trip and was a bit leery but based on the cost of other hotels in the area we decided to try it. There were 6 of us in our party - with 2 rooms reserved. Our room included in a refrig. but no microwave while the 2nd room had neither. The fan in the bathroom sounded like an airplane overhead and this was in both rooms. The furnishings could be updated - very simple table, desk, drawer, and nightstand. While watching tv we kept hearing a high pitch screeching and finally determined it to be the tv. The room itself was clean but the layout is different with the bath area split up into two areas - a toliet area and then a separate sink area. This would normally be fine but it just seemed to be congested. The kids were excited with the pool until we got a chance to go there on Sat. night. It was so hot in the pool area it was actually uncomfortable. The kids were saying there were worn areas on the bottom of the pool where it seemed to have worn to sand. The breakfast area needs to be updated too. We saw mold on the walls and peeling paint. Would I stay here again? No - I would not. We've always enjoyed staying at Comfort Inns but this one needs some work. We saw in the their local phone book how this hotel had won awards - not sure why.

When we got to the hotel we were told that they did not have king rooms that connected, We could have queen rooms that connect for an additional $10 per room per night! The hotel itself was not maintained well. Wall paper was peeling, the pool was peeling and missing concrete inside. The play room jungle gym's poles had foam covers that were split open and falling out. Everything was grimy. There was only one elevator for the whole hotel and during the morning time it was in constant use by the house cleaning staff. The breakfast bar had coffee, oatmeal, 3 types of dry cereal, breads, bagels and pastry and a waffle station, yogurt, apple and orange juice. There was ample seating and high chairs. The rooms were okay, my husband cut his foot on carpet tacks that had come up on the floor. The hotel wifi did not work and we were credited $15 back. In all we were disappointed with the hotel.

I booked a block of 10 rooms 1/16/07. Someone there cancelled all rooms 1/31/07 and never told us. Bumped 3/4 of us to the Sleep Inn. When you read the other reviews about the phones not working believe them! that also means you are unable to order pizza. Due to a security policy you must use a hotel phone but if if all the hotel phones are down...No pizza for the group!!!! The ants...yeah... that's trus also... but they are literally climbing up the walls at both here and the Sleep Inn, which by the way are owned by the same person. The staff is great but there is quick turnaround due to the owners lack of response to correct issues correctly. Staff takes a good bit of the beatings from the guests. Let me see we didn't have hot water for one day. One of the vehicles got stripped of all 4 tires/wheels in the parking lot the next day. Noone could use the shuttle because the owner had received moey from one group for the sole use of the shuttle. Then, of course, I can't forget the fire alarm which evacuated the building, which fortunately was a false alarm! Oh yeah, 4 of us had booked suites and had confirmed suites and got a double room. They had reserved 60 non smoking rooms when they only have 35. There are obviously some serious issues with how this hotel is operated. Becky the director of sales that I had worked with, which is not the person that cancelled our reservations, that was a prior director. Becky's last day was Wednesday 4/4 because she just couldn't continue working in the role she was in. I have stayed in numerous Choice Hotels and this hotel does not meet the criteris.

Lobby is not at the street level, so you always have to take the elevator from the entrance at the street. If possible ask for rooms far from elevators, cause they are a little noisy. At the departure i left the luggage at the locker service, good and cheap. Probably i would repeat to spend one or two nights.

The four of us who went have very high standards. The location is the best right next to Broadway, 15 mins walk from 5th avenue, 25 mins from Empire State and same for Rockerfella Centre. Central Park is no more than 25-30 mins walk. Bit difficult learning the street system of NY, but we found everyone in NY was willing to help and point us in the right direction!! I have to say a big thankyou to Arielle for answering all our questions prior to our stay!

The test lasted for more than two hours and was extremely disruptive - announcements over the intercom, intermittent beeps, men entering the room to set off the fire alarm in the room. The hotel did not provide advance notice to the guests - no signs by the elevators, no information upon check-in. Fourth, it takes a long time to get in and out of the hotel.

The hotel is up to the somewhat predictable standards of the Novotel chain - so you won't take any risks. I feel that I ought to mention a couple of (minor) drawbacks - so here we go: (1) the internet access costs $9.95 per day and is lousy: every page takes a minute or so to load and you might as well forget about anything that requires speed of any kind; (2) the hotel is 40+ stories high but to get to the lobby, you first have to take one of two small-ish elevators from street level. If you arrive just following a larger group, your wait to advance to the lobby could be longer than wished for; (3) the mid-town location is great for sights but will cost you - New York is at its most expensive here, even involving a normal breakfast in a diner or deli.

The room was spacious and very clean, we had no traffic sound. We didnt pay for the internet option as we didnt really need it and Starbucks was just across the road which offered free access which pleased my son. The hotel has 3 Apple Macs in the lobby it was just a matter of picking the right time to use them for printing boarding passes out for our next flight. For Breakfast we used Cranberry Deli west 45th street (Between 6th & Broadway) which is approximately 15 mins walk from the hotel and just off Times Square. You can get a filling breakfast and a drink from here for around $4 and they offer something for everyone. We also had dinner a couple of doors up at perfect pint Irish bar which offered good food and was good value.

Next door to Wicked/Gershwin Overall - Great Hotel Cons: Heat did not work properly; ran constatnly - When we ask them to fix it....NO PROBLEM! When we came back we found the window opened--HAHA!

Rooms are spacious, clean and beds are very big and comfy! We got an excellent price for the hotel and flights with Thomas Cook for this time of year. But I have rated down on value due to the cost of eating in the hotel or even sitting in the lounge to have a drink being so highly priced. With a breakfast buffet being $22 per person. But with so much being within a stones throw of the hotel it is not needed but would have been nice to have the option. Ellen's stardust diner is literally opposite the hotel and does a fab breakfast much much cheaper. The hotel has a terrace balcony outside which over looks times square which is great for photo opportunities and views are spectacular. Lobby and lounges are very clean and modern. Staff were friendly, but we did have one incidence where a pair of earrings went missing out of our room off the bedside table and the only person who entered our room was a maid so whether they were swept up whilst changing the bed I'm not sure but this was the only downfall to our holiday. The security manager did visit us and advised he was submitting a report to their insurance company, but we as yet have heard nothing. So use the safe provided for every valuable you have, it was only by pure mistake that I forgot to put the earrings back in after a shower that they went missing. Upon day of leaving we had a late flight and check out is at 12, but the hotel does offer bag keeping service for $1 per bag for the whole day. Which I thought was very reasonable. Otherwise you can pay for late check out but it is $100 until 6pm. The only thing I think the room would benefit from would be a tea and coffee making facilities. But we got cold drinks from the pharmacy underneath the hotel which was very reasonable in price but the room lacked a proper fridge facility. Other amenities included a gym and business area with wifi that can be used for 20minutes per login for free, but you can login using the same details over and over again. Paying to have wifi in the room is very highly priced at $40 for the week on one device. Useful for checking details on things you plan to do whilst on the trip. Such as schedules for boat and bus trips of which I would recommend both. But starbucks has free wifi, and with a starbucks on every block it is very easy to access. Overall we had a fab holiday only spoilt by the earring incident. But I would definitely recommend the hotel for location and rooms.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the price\u201d", "Author": "h00ked0nvegas", "ReviewID": "UR124091231", "Content": "We just stayed in this hotel for the last week.

It makes it all the difference as the View at night time is grand. Bedroom is very spacious and very modern. I had slight problems with the heating at about 2am but called up reception and the electrician was there in a flash to sort it out- very impressive.

Novotel is on 52nd Street and only about 5 mins walk to Times Square its so so close but yet far enough from the Madness at time Square. The closest Subway is on 53rd street, 2mins walk from Novotel - it takes 2 changes to JFK which will cost you $7.50 and a 45min ride.

Many Broadway theatres within a few hundred meters walk. Taxis to Soho, Wall Street, Brooklyn Bridge and attractions in the south end of Manhatten Island were $10-20. The rooms are fairly plain although well-equipped and very clean. A room with Times Square views is a must to make the most of the New York experience. The restaurant (Nicole) had excellent dinner and views if you prefer to eat in, although many other restaurants very close along Broadway and 8th Avenue. The breakfast buffet was good although a bit expensive if you only want a light meal of fruit or cereal and not the full suite of cooked items. Service was exceptional. Some reviews mention thin walled rooms however I had no issue with excessive noise and the block out blinds ensure the Times Square lights don't keep you up all night.

I have never written a review on a hotel before but feel that because we enjoyed it so much we would have the honour or recommending the Novotel to future visitors.

The Rockafella building is around the corner and so are the theatres. There are many bars and Central Park is only a couple of blocks walk. The hotel itself is extremely well presented, from the lobby to the bar which is spotless throughout. The service and help at the desk was excellent. We needed a phone card and the staff told us where to get one, how much to pay and even how to use it when we brought it back to the hotel. They could not do enough for us. We upgraded before we left to a room with a view of the skyscrapers, we were on the 33rd floor, but that was OK because the elevator has a TV in it. The room we had was large, it had a King size bed, a two seater sofa and a HD plasma TV as well as safe, wardrobe, double desk unit and good sized on suite. The room was cleaned everyday at a convenient time and we were made to feel most welcome by the housekeepers.

NY is not cheap...so you cannot compare these to Asian hotels on price. The Good : Location is about a 5 min walk north of Times Square and within easy walking distance of Rockerfeller centre and Central Park. Subway is close. It is also close to on and off Broadway shows and some great restaurants (Stage Deli is just around the corner and is a must do!) Plenty of shopping close by and not too far from Macy's or Bloomingdales. Mind you, we did not mind walking around as New York is so interesting. The bed was comfortable and saved the room a bit. The terrace outside the restaurant is worth a look for some great times square views and photos. Close by (just on the corner) is a Duane Reade which is very, very handy (supermarket and pharmacy). If you walk up to central park up broadway however (about a 10 min walk) make sure you go to Wholefoods in the Time Warner centre (take note Coles ands Woolworths - this chain of supermarkets embarrasses you both). The staff in general were friendly and nice. Found one person - Ian, at the front desk who was great! The bad : The rooms are about 5 years overdue for renovation and seriously need to be redone. The bathroom is ok, but again needs to be renovated. There is a mini bar that is sensor activated and you have to pay for a fridge if you want one (not good at these hotel prices). The hotel enters via 2 elevators from street levels then you have to cross the lobby to get to the main elevators. Not a huge issue but is a pain at times especially after a long day out and about. The breakfast is overpriced and not great. In all reality with so many delis and Cafes close by, dont bother with the breakfast, just go out and enjoy the NY food. Wifi is not free, which is really lagging behind, but they do offer a few Macs downstairs in the lobby for free which is nice if you can get on one. Overall : If I came back to NY I would reconsider this hotel. Price vs location works well for this hotel, if it gets renovated would go up in rating as long as the prices stayed the same.

Very clean en-suite, flat screen TV, we were given free wifi for the full stay and there were also three iMac computers in the lobby for guest's use. The staff were very friendly and the concierge was very helpful, we did not eat at the hotel as the staff reccommended so many good (and cheaper) places nearby. The location is just north of times square and so we always felt very safe going out around the hotel at night - also we did not suffer from any kind of noise at night. Don't be put off that the lobby is on the ninth floor - the lifts at the entrance do not take you anywhere else and so you cannot get lost (however I did not see any stairs so may not be suitable for people who avoid lifts). Also, this just made the hotel feel very safe and secure. We got a very reasonable price for the room and based on the quality of what we recieved for this I would recommend to anybody. Do note that (as is usual in USA) there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room - this didn't bother me but it did bother my husband.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia, pa", "Title": "\u201cMeh\u201d", "Author": "rdooz", "ReviewID": "UR122793942", "Content": "Novotel is really just okay.

Reservations were made through their website a few months in advance. Location is very good, being walking distance to many attractions (Rockefeller, NY Public Library/Bryant Park...) and the subway station. Check in was efficient. We came in early and had our luggage stored with them. However we had another room reserved for family, and this was not available until 5pm. Front desk gave a couple of drink vouchers for this inconvenience. The room was more spacious than we had expected, with comfy king size bed and sofa (with a pull-out bed), and the bathroom was a good size too. It was a passable 3 star hotel room showing its age and wear (peeling paint in the bathroom ceiling, jiggly doorknob...). The safe accommodated a laptop, iPad and DSLR camera (could probably fit an additional camera lens). Wifi was free for the holiday season, otherwise there's a surcharge. Room cleaning was fine. The only problem we had with the room was the lack of temperature control. We were informed that there was no air conditioning during the winter, only heating. So our room got particularly warm in the evenings, which was not neutralized by the partially opened window. We stayed for the Times Square view, and paid for it. Our room was on the 25/F and we spent an evening just watching the lights and screens below. One would think the price steep if one considers the standard of the room, which also did not include breakfast (or wifi if you stayed outside the holiday season), but upper end hotels are even more expensive so this oddly turns out the more reasonable deal. It may be noteworthy for others that the hotel room does not have floor to ceiling views of Times Square. You can only see it if you sit or stand by the window. For us this was a one time \"indulgence\" of a room-with-Times-Square-view, and not worth repeating.

I had a king with city view but the room was almost a suite, it had a small sofa and coffee table besides the bed, quite a large space. Everything was very nice and the location cannot be beat. It is only 2 short blocks from the subway so easy to get to from Penn Station, for example, and easy to go to/from on your visit. I chose the location as I was doing a lot of theater that weekend, so it worked, but easy to take the 50th St crosstown bus to Madison Ave if you want to take the M1-4 buses or take the subway to/from LInconln center, etc. My only demerits are that they have an ominous sign on the minibar about charging you if some automatic sensor can tell you moved something (no big deal for a weekend, I was thinking of using it for some drinks of my own, but didn't). So I didn't look in it to see if there was empty space or not as I didn't want to get into issues at checkout, but that seems a little petty. My only real complaint is that I didn't like the pillows. They were very thick and rather hard (not sure what they were made of), so your neck would have to be raised maybe 6 inches if you used them. I don't use a thick pillow like that at home and cannot.sleep that way so I had to sleep without any pillow, which is not optimal either. Everything else was fine, comfortable (the mattress was good, not too hard like some hotels can have), nice decor, and great location so I could have given then 5 stars but to me that means perfection and they weren't perfect. PS The \"amazing city\" view is nothing special and not so amazing, just buildings, of course, but better than looking at a close wall.

It is in a great position in the theatre district, a stones throw from Times Square and was an excellent base (location-wise) to explore the city. Disappointed upon arrival to have been allocated a very smelly smoking room (particularly as my other half has a Novotel loyalty card and his profile expressly states non-smoking!) - to be fair, they did change us to another room once we'd gone back down to the lobby, but after a long-haul flight and dragging your luggage up in the lift, you really don't need this! The staff were generally rather supercilious - whether this was because the majority of guests appeared to be French and we were English, I can't be sure, but it was perceptible. The second room was ok, but lacked basic things that would have made our stay more pleasant ... for example there was no mirror above the desk/dressing table, so application of make-up, hair straightening etc had to be done in the bathroom or in front of a mirrored wardrobe door (with no plug or surface except the floor to put your stuff on!). On the subject of wardrobe, insufficient number of coathangers were provided - half a dozen for 2 people for a 6 night stay. More importantly, the room was dirty ... there was loads of dust, including on an electric transformer plug which belonged to the telephone on which I was able to write my name it was so thick! Drew this to the attention of a member of staff, but it was still the same when we left 6 days later despite the room having been 'cleaned' daily. On the first day, found a very long hair on the tiles in the shower ... either it belonged to a previous guest or my husband has some questions to answer! I probably should have made more of a fuss, but frankly didn't want to let anything spoil my vacation so put up with a less than pristine room. It was an unusually mild week so it was disappointing that the 'air conditioning' blew out warm air ... but at least while it was on, it disguised the sound of the lift which was just through the wall from our room. Resorted to alcohol to block this out in the end! On the plus side, the bed was comfy. The breakfast buffet was good, although pricey (but this is a city, so I suppose to be expected) and we ate an evening meal in the restaurant one night which we enjoyed.

This location is close to Times Square and also within walking distance of Columbus Circle and Central Park. There are a ton of great dining and shopping options within steps of this door.

Just a few minutes walk from the Hotel there are subway stops-bit hard to navigate at times but value for money for travelling, vendors on street corners selling tours and the Hotel is within walking distance from the Port Authority Terminus for buses to Woodbury Common - the outlet stores - so worth a visit and bring an empty suitcase because you will need it for transporting all those designer goods home..... Had drinks one night at the Hotel and they are a bit expensive compared to say TGI's where you have happy hour but it is nice sitting on the balcony sipping a cocktail overlooking Times Square.

She was not accommodating at all and a bit put out that I should be inquiring about my original reservation. Not what I wanted after a very long and delayed flight. When I got to my room I called down to ask for a top sheet for the bed and was told hotel policy was that the duve` was all i could get. When pressed she (the same young lady at check in) annoyingly said to wait and put me on hold. In the time on hold I discovered I could remove the feather tic from the cover and use that as a top sheet. (It was very warm in NY) I hung up and never heard back. The next afternoon I went to the front desk and a very lovely young lady helped into my new room. When I inquired about another cover for the bed and what I was told the night (very early morning) before she looked at me very confused and said she would take care of it. Not 5 minutes after I was in my room a very nice man delivered a duve` cover as a top sheet for me and said if there was ANYTHING at all I needed to please let him know. (this is the Novotel I know) I was very pleased to see Gerard and Heather in the bar area that night!!! What wonderful people and so accommodating! Always wonderful to see familiar faces! The food at your hotel is wonderful but your staff leaves a lot to be desired. My second morning at the hotel I ordered oatmeal thinking it would be easy and fast. 30 minutes later as I was getting up from the table to leave for a business meeting it arrived. Unacceptable! I think I am most disappointed because we (my 2 colleagues and myself) chose your hotel over many others due to the wonderful service the year before. I am certainly willing to give this hotel another try because everyone has an off day.

The guy in the registration desk took my ID and credit card and told me that I couldn't check in until 3 pm. Seeing that I had the whole morning and afternoon to kill, I checked in my bag for safe keeping and walked around Time Square. I arrived back to the hotel at 1pm only because I grew tired from my red-eye flight and waited at their lobby. It was very upsetting that while I waited til \"3 pm\" to check in, there were numerous groups/people that were checking in at 1:30pm when they arrived at the hotel. It was only because I saw this while in the lobby that I finally was able to check in even though they weren't going to let me check in until the 3 pm time slot. The room was very small. Very small desk. The carpet was hard and not padded. The bathroom was very \"minimalistic\" and didn't have enough counter for 1 person's toiletries much less two or more. The shower must be a European style type with the shower head coming from the top and only had a 1.5 inch barrier on the floor to keep the water from wetting the rest of the tile floors.

The safe was locked when we got the room and it took quite some time to get this solved. The staff is quite impersonal and quite inefficient as far as I am concerned. We had an issue with an Accor promotion (free breakfast for any reservation in the US in very large characters in numerous emails, \"depending on availability\" in very small characters - typical \"borderline\" marketing). The issue was in fact with Accor, not the hotel itself, but it has been a nightmare to get the attention of a manager to get the problem solved. At the end, they proposed half a solution by giving breakfast coupons for one day, which was a positive gesture from the hotel, but the original issue has not been addressed. We decided to leave it there and to concentrate on our trip. Overall the hotel is good, comfortable (except for the noise), the food is good, the location is good, but the service has been less professional than I would have expected.

Another thing is that internet is not free, the price is not exaggerated for a week, but you need to pay per device which is ridiculous nowadays (We usually travel with two smartphones, a laptop, an iPad, this is the 21st century...). One last comment: the Novotel chain is French and several employees do speak French - this could be important/useful to French visitors.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cmiddle of the road\u201d", "Author": "starflyergold", "ReviewID": "UR112897105", "Content": "I recently stayed 4 nights at the Novotel Times Square as my normal haunt the Sofitel was just too expensive. The hotel is centrally located at 52nd St/Broadway and ideally located for any tourist activities (if one must). The entrance at street level is rather glum and down heel, up an elevator to the 7th floor lands you on the lobby and restaurant floor. The lobby is bright and airy. Unfortunately at 1 pm my booked room was not ready and I was told by the altogether not too friendly receptionist at the separate A-Club check in counter that I would have to wait til 3 pm which is official check in time. I wasn't too happy about the lack of welcome or the wait time after a transatlantic flight but at least one of the other staff got on the case and after an hour I got my room. Despite the reservation stating \"KING BED WONDERFUL TIMES SQUARE VIEW\" the view was of the back of buildings onto 8th Av. so technically not what I had booked but I was happy to get to my room. A voucher for an A-Club Platinum drink was handed over at check in. The corridors are bland and slightly worn out as was the room. Wear and tare has not been kind to the hotel and while there was nothing seriously wrong with the room it certainly showed its age and lack of upkeep. The bathroom was standard tourist size and not exactly spotlessly clean. Toiletries were unbranded Novotel and nothing special. The bed was large with a thin duvet and a good choice of pillows. Sleep quality was ok though unfortunately the air condition (despite what the display said) had only two settings: off and arctic rendering the duvet too flimsy to be warm (outside temperature was 39c so aircon was a must). Internet access was only available via paid wifi and if like me you travel with more than one laptop and iphone you must pay for each gadget's access separately which was very expensive and not acceptable. Very positive (and better than the Sofitel) was the fact that all TV channels were available in HD. The restaurant served a decent buffet breakfast ($25) which was good and offered great views over Times Square. The best part of the hotel was the outside terrace which had plenty of seating (limited service during the day) and is available to smokers. Room service was good and well priced. I had a fantastic steak and frites one night which was better than the equivalent in the Sofitel. I had arranged for a late check out which was confirmed on the day of departure for which I was very grateful. The rates were very high and 4 nights came to $1840. However it should be noted that all hotels during this week were expensive or sold out. Verdict: The Novotel is a standard tourist hotel and while basic in many respects offers a decent service. It is not luxury or even upmarket but if you get a good rate it should be fine. Some more loving attention to maintenance, customer service (though some receptionists were great, the initial welcome was not) and cleaning would make it better. While A-Club Platinum members per rules get nothing other than points at Novotel I was offered a drinks voucher and late check out. Points were credited correctly within 24 hours.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cThis is not a Mobile Four Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "reunion041", "ReviewID": "UR112785835", "Content": "Disappointed that the European Travel Agency sold this hotel to us as a \"Four Star Hotel\" which it is definitely NOT!

The carpets were miserably stained in our room and throughout the hotel. My children found game pieces, m&ms and toenail clippers that must have belonged to previous guests-apparently housekeeping does not vacuum. We neatly grouped our beverage bottles for housekeeping to take away the second day-a family of four goes through a lot of water and iced tea-not to mention a few beers for dad! Housekeeping never touched them. All in all, we got a good deal on Expedia for this hotel- I would have been really dissapointed if we had paid a lot more. Also, how much time is really spent in your hotel room in NYC? However,, as a matter of principle they should do a better job.

The Guggenheim is a masterpiece and the American Museum of Natural History can take you all day to get round. They are both across from each other East and West of Central park.

In fact they even provide an ice machine on every floor to chill your JD. One tip - Don't buy a drink at the bar, 1 beer and 1 coffee $17. We used the Grayline bus tours 72 hour all loops. Fantastic value. Book before you go and save money. Also theatre tickets - cheap tickets are available daily at TKTS at Times Square. Don't use that office, go to the South Ferry Seaport on the downtown loop and use the TKTS office there. Much quieter and easier. We got great seats at Jersey Boys at a $0% discount. Places to eat - Ellens Starburst Diner and Emett O Lunneys on Times Square and THE best deli on the planet Carve on the corner of 8th Ave and 48th or 49th Street (can't remember which one). All in all a fabulous trip with wonderful memories.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cote d'Azur", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sfs56", "ReviewID": "UR98406528", "Content": "Have just spent four days at Novotel Times Square with my 12 year old daughter.

Right from the start, with a warm welcome at the front desk in reception from Ian who gave us some great tips for our stay, we felt relaxed, secure and assured. All the staff offered the same level of courtesy with humour and patience. Even when we wrongy reported the hairdryer as not working! Room service was quick and friendly and the bar staff were also helpful. The hotel has a stylish interior that belies its modest exterior appearance. The bar area is very comfortable and has is great for people watching as it is adjacent to the reception area. The room we had was comfortable, with all the fixtures yoo'd expect. We did pay extra to get a Boradway/Times Square view but this is worth it as it is spectatcular, especially from the 29th floor where we were.

There are also countless broadway musical shows litereally on the doorstep of this hotel. Also within a 2 minute walk was the Subway, so you couls get anywhere in NYC with ease! You simply cannot go wrong with this location! The hotel itself is average. The rooms were were not that big. But it was comfortable enough for us, and it was always 100% clean which is the most important thing. It is a typical 3* Hotel, so dont expect anything too fancy. I found that it was however great value for the price we paid, taking into account how expensive the hotels in Times Square are. Staff were friendly and helpful.

The restaurant was the only pretty part of the hotel and had a nice view of the Times Square, but again, that was the only good thing about it. The buffet was very basic (aka small) with pancakes, sausages, bacon, potatoes, scrambled egg, some cold cheese and sausage, some fruit, orange juice (not fresh!), yoghurt and some pastries. No omelettes, no french toast. I liked the mozarella cheese which tasted very fresh, but they had no olive oil or balsamic vinegar for it that usually comes with mozarella.

They have a good breakfast buffet also but if you don't like it then you won't struggle to find somewhere else outside of the hotel!

We did not have the breakfast as it was only a buffet style and to be honest, there are plenty of diners right around the corner to get the all-american breakfast. We did eat dinner one night in the restaurant and it was very good, however, there is much more variety and choice outside due to the excellent location. The rooms were very comfortable and cleaned every day and all have air-con which is definately a bonus. We had booked to see Wicked (the musical) and was very happy when we found the theatre was actually on the next block along from the hotel.

The lobby is a bit impersonal, and the area for free internet use is a little cramped with no seats, but that's probably intentional to discourage guests from monopolising a machine for lengthy periods of time. We didn't use the hotel restaurant, there are plenty of places to have breakfast around - don't even think about McDonalds for goodness sake, you can get that in UK. We particularly enjoyed the Food Emporium (take a left out of the hotel to the end of the street, take a left and keep walking, and Food Emporium is on your left a couple of blocks down .... so much to choose from in the store and then you can eat it in the seating area). There's also a good bagel store if you take a left out of the hotel to the end of the street and then turn right. We stayed 5 nights, and thoroughly recommend the 48 hour 'all loop' Gray Line bus tour if it's your first trip ..... you can see so much in the first 2 days and then plan your remaining days around what you see. We had a total of 5 different guides, two of which were outstanding, the others pretty average. If you think yours isn't too good, just get off and get on the next bus!

Food was mediocre, wine expensive and they ask you for a tip!!!! Doesnt matter how much you think they deserve they wiil return to your table and ask for it, putting you on the spot. Not our idea of good service, we werent new to New York as my husband hd been on previous occassions so we were aware of the tiping. avoid it like the plague! We enjoyed the Irish bars such as Patrick Conways nr Grand Central great food and service, also loved The Perfect Pint.

When we arrived I was excited because we were put up on the 33 floor. When we walked into the room, the first thing I noticed was how hot the room was. I called down to the front desk and the gave me some story about how the building was on central heat and air and basically what you see is what you get. What made me mad is that when I complained about the temp being too hot, no one even came up to the room to check the tempature. Its kind of like they know that have a crappy hvac system and they get those calls all the time. I was told I could open the window to cool the unit down. Now for $350+/night, I dont feel like I should be put out with hearing the car horns in time square just so I can get some good sleep. One other annoying thing about the temp situation is that while it is hot as hell in the room, the only bed linens we have to cover up with is a down comforter? Did the manager of hospitality get his degree online or something here? What kind of mickey mouse racket are you running here? I called again after 2 hours and no change in the temp and complained further and they brought me up a bed sheet to cover up with instead. I unfolded the bed sheet and threw it across my girlfriend and I, then when I looked at the sheet closer, it literally looked like someone had wiped thier butt with the sheet. Yes 2 brown stains right in the middle about the size of a football. I complained again this morning but as another post said, the staff is very reluctant to help it seems like. I informed them this morning that the hallway (which has its own non central hvac unit) is actually cooler than our room. I told them I was going to end up having to sleep in the hallway if they could not do anything about the temp. So to sum it all up, if you are traveling on business and sleep matters to you, this place is not for you. I think this is a better place for Europeans because they are used to being in non-airconditioned living environments more than americans are. With the type of system they have here, they might as well not have one at all. I feel like this hotel is one of the worst values for the moeny I have ever spent.

Best features are its location, large rooms by NYC standards, great views (we were on the 23rd floor with a river view - impressive both by day and night), cleanliness and good bathroom, including both a bathtub and decent shower. Unlike other reviewers, we found the rooms very quiet, and the lifts very efficient (we never had to wait more than a minute). The cleaning staff were a delight - always smiling and jolly. The fitness room was fantastic, full of the latest equipment and open 24 hours a day, plenty of towels and free fruit. Seemed a bit odd that there was never a member of staff there - this didn't bother us, but perhaps for health and safety there should have been? Minor negative points: we arrived well after check-in time at 3pm and the reception staff assumed we'd be happy with a twin-bedded room, which we weren't - we'd to wait till 3.40 for the king-sized we'd booked, and we weren't the only ones waiting. A free drink would have been in order, really, but wasn't offered, nor was the hint of an apology (the Novotel is after all very French!).. And the lack of any instructions at all in the room was irritating - ie, no TV guide, anything on how to adjust the heating/air con, details re hotel facilities (the hotel guide section on the TV is not set up either), so you have to ring Reception to find out where the fitness room is (on the mezzanine floor), what time check-out is (a generous 12 noon), etc. And in particular, no tariff for the movies or 'phone - caveat emptor here, it cost us 58 dollars for two urgent calls to the UK totalling less than 6 minutes. We knew it would be pricey, but ouch! Buy an international 'phone card if you need to ring home (we were surprised to find that neither of our rather elderly mobiles worked in New York, as we had no problem in China or Sri Lanka - one is on the O2 network, one on Virgin). The location can't be bettered. Walking distance to so many theatres, restaurants, Central Park and Museum Mile, Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Carnegie Hall, etc. We didn't try the pricey hotel food as there are loads of restaurants and vendors everywhere. We advise the 30 minute walk over to Ess-a-Bagel on 3rd Avenue and 51st Street for the best bagels in town, served with an authentic NY sneer! The Carnegie Deli on 7th and 55th near the hotel serves a very good breakfast too, and don't discount Starbucks or McDonalds just round every corner for cheap and cheerful (I don't know how many calories there are in those McD Cinnamon Melts, but they're worth it). Rosie O'Grady's bar prices are exorbitant - the Benash bar just up the road (7th Ave and 55th) do very generous apple and watermelon martinis and Manhattans for 6 dollars (didn't try the food). The best pizza we had was at Patzeria's on 46th St between 7th and 8th Ave - full of locals, which gave us the hint. Don't do what we do and order a whole pizza - they're massive. A slice each will probably do. Katz's Deli was great for brunch - subway downtown to Delancey, and it's at 205 E Houston Street just up the road from there. Quite an experience! We also loved the Oyster Bar and Zocalos Mexican at Grand Central Station, the Italian on Broadway just round the corner from the hotel, opposite where they film the Letterman Show - looks scruffy but the food's great. But wherever you go you'll be spoilt for choice. If you want to sit in on the Letterman Show, just call at the theatre box office at 10 am - they give away free tickets for the same evening (but only Monday to Thursday).

The room was a good size - not the tiny one I'd expected from other reviewers and we had a view right out over Times Square. We did book a King room and only ended up having a double bed - but we walked so much and spent so little time inthe room, it was of no real concern to us. The rest of the room we had was what we had booked. The room itself was clean and housekeeping did a good job each day. Linen and towels were changed daily whether we needed them new or not. A room safe that was lap top size was very handy. Only downsides were the usual USA thing about the fridge being sensored - (that is take a Coke out of the fridge and it goes straight onto your bill) - so there was nowhere to store your own drinks (ice and buckets were available); there was no guest laundry - had to use a laundromat several streets away (often a problem on a long holiday!) and the internet was not free - which shold really be a \"gimme\" for hotels of Novotels standing by now. I think we ended up paying $20 for a weeks access though - which was not too bad. We ate breakfast at the hotel once, which was a little disappointing - not much choice for the price, but the food was good. For all other meals, there were simply too many other options right outside the door and Times Square has everything you could want or need at any time of the day or night!

We also requested adjoining rooms. On check in we learned that all of their bedrooms in the hotel contain two double beds and no adjoining rooms were available. The receptionist tried to be helpful and put us on the same floor (level 9), just a few doors apart. This worked fine for us and grandma/ granddaughter shared a bed.

They have a mini-bar, but it automatically charges you when you remove an item. I'm not a fan of these new systems, because I like to buy soda and water on my own and keep them cold. So I had to request a mini fridge for my room for a small fee per day!! They also don't have any \"do not distrub\" signs to hang on your door, so be prepared for housekeeping to knock at any time during the day. But those are the only minor downsides to the hotel.

We flew American Airlines Heathrow - JFK. Left London around 6pm (UK time) and go to New York late evening. the flight was good, you get decent amount of rooms in the standard seats & we got free refreshments and food the whole flight! (Not something you usually get when youre from the UK!!!!) When we got to JFK and got through all the security and gave them our fingerprints!!! we grabbed a cab to down town Manhattan. $45 standard fee from JFK to Manhattan anytime! Which was pretty good. Taxi dropped us off on Broadway on the corner of 52nd street, the street our hotel was on. We were staying at the Novotel Times Square. The hotel was LOVELY. We checked in, and went up to our room which was on the 32nd floor!!! and it gave us an amazing view of Times Square! i think we landed lucky with this as you got to option for a room on floors above 26 or something when we booked to get this type of view but we didnt take that as it was an additional charge!! The Room was really nice, lovely decorated, MASSIVE bed & Bathroom with a wet floor and the shower kind of just ran on to it! Once we had had a wee look around our room and dropped the bags off that was us... out till 2am NY Time (7am UK) we were just buzzing with the atomsphere that we werent even tired! and the place was still rocking incl the shops at this time of morning!! we did some shopping in American Eagle, Levi's etc etc...! Another lucky thing, we had gone the week of Thanksgiving, it was on the Thursday and we arrived on the Friday so there were all the sales... And i mean SALES!!!! The only bad thing about it was as it was the weekend we were there, all the americans were on holiday too and go away for it!! So all the shops were mobbed 24/7!! We were shopping all day saturday on 5th avenue!! Its just amazing seeing all these shops. from H&M to Henri Bendels and Saks etc... Saturday night we went to see a show. we chose Memphis! it was a good show, would recommend it if youre in to music from the 60's era!! After we went for supper at a steak house on the same street as the hotel! BIG, BIG Mistake!! the cheapest meal you could have was $45!!!!! When eating in New York Stick to chinese resturants or take outs of any sorts!! Definately the nicest & cheapst food option! On the sunday i wanted to go on the Gossip Girl Tour so i booked it before we went and dragged mum along!! If youre a lover of GG its a great tour! You meet outside the palace Hotel and hop on the bus. I enjoyed every minute! you get hop off stops where you get to go in to some of the locations on the programme! So take money with you to buy stuff as you will in Dylans candy store!! :D At the end of the tour you are dropped off MILES away from where you started and you will either need to grab a cab or get the subway back to youre end of town!! No offence to anyone that rides the subway, but i will NOT being doing it again if i go back to NY! it scared the hell out of me!! I suppose its one of those things though, if you do it you get used to it! We had to ask a local which one to get on and just looked out for the sign saying 42nd street and hopped off! ANYWAY !! After that we did some more shopping!!! haha! by the end of sunday the jet lag had well and truely caught up on us, we grabbed a take out from one of the shops around the corner from hotel and went to the room to eat it and we were bedded by 7pm!! The next day was Monday our last day so we went to Macys as you need a whole day in the place or you wont get to see it all!! I liked macys alot and spent a fortune in there but if youre not from US if you go to the visitors desk they give you a card to carry around the shop and you get 10% off every purchase. So take youre passport or some sort of ID that shows you arent from the US!! The 2 ladies in front of us showed thier british bus passes!!!!! hahaha! Monday night, we went to the Empire State building! Be weary of the people that work there! they try to con you out of money!!! we were told when we'd go in that it was foggy and when we got to the top we wouldnt see anything so we should go on this virtual thing..... Guess what? We got to the top and seen EVERYTHING!!! Clear as a picture! If you are going in winter take a jacket scarf gloves & umberella with you as its freezing up there and can rain too obviously!! that night we went to a chinese resturant for some food. we were $40 for all our food and drink for the 2 of us!! dont ask me to tell you what it was called or where it was as it was just up some back street !! Tuesday morning, we had to be at the airport for 7am. so up at 5, downstairs in reception checking out by 6.15 and the guy in the lobby got a taxi for us to take us to airport. Got to Airport, checked in and then dropped our bags off at the bag drops you get. and headed through to departures for some breakfast! Again, a good flight home! only thing our second snack/ meal on the flight was a ham & cheese sandwich...... which was frozen SOLID!!! So overall the whole holiday was great! and if i could i would go back every year at this time of year just for the shopping etc..!!! :D", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Time Square Location\u201d", "Author": "STEVEFR", "ReviewID": "UR57927984", "Content": "Hotel is situated almost perfectly on the upper stretch of Time Square.

On arrival we found ourselves at the end of a long queue checking in, but within no time we were taken care of and in our room. Desk staff are efficient and fast. The room which we shared with our two children was spacious and clean - our bags unpacked, there was ample storage out of the way and plenty of space for everyone in the room, although the bathroom was a bit narrow, but nothing more than that. Looking out onto Times Square we were apprehensive about possible noise - but didn't hear a thing! We had drinks in the bar most nights; they are more expensive there than in neighbouring restaurants and bars, but then you do pay for the mesmerising view of Times Square... We ate twice in the restaurant at dinner; the food cannot be faulted - however service is a little slow, so order first and enjoy your pre-dinner drink at the table rather than at the bar. Breakfast was a vast buffet catering for many different nationalities and again faultless. Price-wise, yes it is probably more expensive than going out, but who wants to face the cold NY air in February without something to eat first? We didn't! There is a good shop in the foyer with lots of souvenirs and postcards, as well as food items and medicines. There is also a fitness room and internet room. For the kids, the highlight was the playstation next to the shop where they were not only entertained, but had a chance to make friends with the other children staying at the hotel. There is a large terrace outside which is probably very nice to relax on in summer but was more than a bit chilly in February! Good photo spot though, whatever the weather. As for it's location - it would be difficult to choose better; a stone's throw from the MOMA, a lazy walk to Central Park, Macy's, ESB, Top of the Rock, and bang in the middle of theatre district.

My fears were laid to rest upon arrival. When we arrived at the hotel we got to reception and begun checking in. I told the gentleman on reception that it was my mothers birthday and I cheekily asked for a good room. The man was very warm and friendly and told me that he would see what he could do. He managed to get us a room looking onto Times Square which was fantastic. He also gave us some really good advice about places to eat, prices of taxi's to various landmarks etc. Already I was well impressed with the level of service from the staff. Having been to many other hotels and destinations it was the best level of customer service I had ever recieved. I thought initially that the good customer service must be a cover for an inadequate room. How wrong I was, the room was clean and modern, well equipped with plenty of toiletries. The television was bigger than what I expected, beds were comfy with nice, clean and fresh smelling bedding on them. Room was well heated with the heating set at just the right temperature. The bathroom was clean and bright and bigger than some of the other hotels I have stayed in. The view from the hotel was truely breathtaking looking down onto Times Square, just opposite the musical mamma mia. The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is central to everything, therefore I would recommend it to anyone travelling to New York for the first time. It is literally a 2 minute walk into Times Square. We got the hop on and hop off bus tour around New York for 3 days and this begins in Times Square so the hotel is ideally situated. The hotel is near all of the broadway musicals and near plenty of shops and lots of excellent resturaunts, it is a 15-20 minute walk to 34th street which is where the empire state building is and Macys department store (the worlds biggest). It is also about a 15 - 20 minute walk to the Rockerfella Centre (home of the famous ice-rink) and Central Park.

Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a terrific view. Very nice. Rooms have a contemporary decoration of good taste. Neutral colors. There is an Ice Machine in every floor (a bit noisy), but in ours it was far from the room (#2204) and could not be heard. The hotel is very quiet and only ocasionaly we could hear people entering the rooms that were next to ours. Very nice King-sized bed. Very clean room. Loved the wooden floor on bathroom (never cold or hot). There is a small sofa on the room, a small coffe table right in front of it and a combination of office table-TV stand-mini bar in front of the bed. The ceiling is made of sound-absorbing material (maybe the reason why the hotel is so quiet). The room was very spatious and we could open 4 very big suitcases on the floor when packing to check out and there was still lots of space on the floor. There is something that we didn\u00c2\u00b4t like. The hotel does NOT offer complimentary WiFi. It is paid (8 dollars/day) and explored by T Mobile. All other hotels at the same level offer free access to the internet. The staff is very helpfull, from house keeping ladies to front desk personel. Our transportation to the airport was going to pick us up at the hotel only at 3pm, and despite the hotels check out time is 12am, we were promptly allowed a late check out (3pm) when asking at the front desk. We would definitely stay at Novotel again and recommend it to friends.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value with the Winter Sale\u201d", "Author": "scapaflow40", "ReviewID": "UR53792667", "Content": "I spent three nights at the Novotel at an average rate of about $170 a night based on an Expedia winter sale.

We were both born and raised in New York and wanted to go back and be a bit touristy. First thing I will agree with most other reviewers that the location of this hotel is very good. We stayed 4 nights and could walk to just about anything or a short cab ride would suffice. Just a few blocks from Times Square, in the heart of the Theater District and around plenty of good restaurants. However we found the facilities lacking and while the staff were exceptionally polite, they seemed unable to understand and comply with even the simplest request or maintenance issue. When we entered the room we found it to be unbearable hot. The heat was on and the thermostat set to 72 degrees, but I assure you it was much hotter. After a bit we realized that the heater was not cycling off and just ran continuously. The only way to get the heat to stop was to turn the unit off. We reported this to the front desk and were advised that since it was cold outside this is how the heating system worked. This excuse was lame at best. So for the nest 4 nights we had to wake up through out the nights to turn the heat on and off to keep the room comfortable. This alone is enough for me to never return and not recommend this property to any of my friends or family. However in addition to the room temperature we found that the hair dryer only blew cold air. Though reported this went unresolved during our stay. We then noticed the bed was made without a flat sheet. We called housekeeping and requested a flat sheet and they came to the room and brought us 2 blankets. We assured them with the heat issue the last thing we needed were blankets and requested the bed be made up with a flat sheet in addition to the fitted sheet. I was ready to chalk the sheet incident up to a communication failure on my part until the next day. The day after we checked in my wife's sister and her husband arrived and checked in for 1 night. The also found no flat sheet on the bed and requested one be delivered. A few moments later someone from housekeeping arrives with, you guessed it, two blankets! To me this shows a a real lacking in attention to detail, listening and comprehension skills. As for the room itself it was of moderate size though the bathroom was a bit small. There were wall tiles falling off in the bathroom and the fixtures were not caulked to the wall in he shower. The bed was comfortable enough and the room was kept fairly clean. There are far better hotels in the area for the price.

I went to New York with my mom and great aunt to visit family and see the city. We chose Novotel because of the pictures that were on the website; they're modern, clean, white with a few colours. When we got there, the lobby was very nice, just like the website had shown, white with accent colours and granet counters. The service was good, pretty average. As soon as we got onto our floor (12th), it was a drastic change. The walls were orange with blue accents and were marked all over. When we got to our room, and turned on the light I almost cried. I was expecting a nice white room, but it felt as if we just stepped into a dingy motel in Arizona or Mexico. The drapes and bedspread were the same generic hotel print, the walls were an odd splotchy orange, with green metal windowframes. I almost expected cockroaches and spiders to come out of the walls. To add to this, the bed was uncomfortable and had lipstick smears all over the pillow. By this time I was upset, because it was a special trip for my birthday, and from the beginning it wasn't what I expected. To make things worse, I had to buy wireless internet that didn't work. The bathroom, however was nice. It was the only part of the room that was modern with very nice lighting for makeup, but the shower wasn't very nice. The shower floor was bumpy, and coming away from the floor. The veiw was also nice, but not the best; we overlooked the top of a dirty building, but in a crowded city it wasn't shocking. The food service was very good! It was one of the best in-room meals I've had. I'm not meaning to turn this hotel off for people, it just is not up to my comfort level. Many people say that they came to the city to see the city, and only have the hotel to sleep.

The hotel bar was quite expensive but it had great staff (thanks to Gerard and Heather). The terrace overlooked Times Square which was an amazing setting (am biased as my partner proposed to me), although it was a bit windy to sit outside when we were there!!! The check in was brief but curtious. The concierge was very helpful although they don't tell you thats its $1 to leave your bags with the bellman if you are waiing round for a flight! If you want a cheap brekkie then turn left when you come out of the hotel and head to the Cosmic Diner. However, if you fancy splashing out then I'd thoroughly recommend the Brooklyn Diner (there are 2, 1 off Times Square and one near Central Park). This diner was recommeded to us by a New Yorker and it didn't disappoint. The most perfect poached eggs. Cannot comment on the food in the hotel as I didn't try it.

I'd recommend the Circle Line bus tours. For $54 we got a 48 hour pass which included downtown tour, uptown tour, Brooklyn tour, night tour, boat tour, $10 off a meal at Planet Hollywood and a free pass to the Museum of American History - the downtown tour was our first real view of Manhatten and it was nice to see the sights and learn a bit of the history off the tour guide.

Before traveling I was alarmed by the reviews from other American travelers staying at this hotel, they seem to be rather harsh where as Europeans seemed to rate their accomodations substantially higher. It is best if you book your rooms directly with the hotel, if you go through a travel site you might ened up getting shafted on your room location. My room had a perfect view of times square, I did book directly with the hotel and I did ask for a room with a good view. The room was a little dusty but it was ok for the price and location. This hotel is very close to two 24 hour drug stores (Duane Reed) and you can purchase small snack items so go ahead and opt for the in room fridge for sodas and things you need to keep cold. There were also several cool diners and delis in the area, the (cosmic diner \"Great Pancakes\", there is a really pizza spot about a block away, mc donalds and the stardust diner, the stardust had a 50's theme and they provide live entertainment from breakfast thru late evening dinner. There are several theaters near by (as of 7/2009 shows such as Billy Elliot, Mama Mia, Wicked and Lion King were all in close proximity to the hotel, I was able to take a short hike to an off off broadway show and it wasnt too bad of a walk. Several banks near by Chase and B of A to name a few). If you have read other reviews you will know about the 3:00 rule - they are serious about this and I saw several pple checking in and having to wait till three to take possession of their rooms. Coordinate your flight accordingly. LGA is the closest airport, I found super shuttle it is the most reasonable thing smoking from the LGA. Super shuttle is an 11 seater van and you will be in close proximity to other passengers plan your time accordingly because the super shuttle stops at several hotels your trip maybe close to an hour and a half depending on what maybe going on in the area. Overall the room was adequate and I would stay there agian only of I could get the same rate as before. Beware of the double decker buses, the windows are obscured and you are not able to really take good photos from the lower decks (greylines was customer service was weak, citysite not sure about them) grey lines was to go to see the city but you have to be on the upper deck some time the buses come by and they are no seats in the upper deck. People will not really answer questions on the streets, (so know before you go) - get a lay of the land from riding the tour bus, get a street map from the hotel and get a subway map from the airport as soon as you get off the plane. The airport has lots of \"Things To Do Brochures and maps\" get that stuff there. They have only two computer and they is always a line for intenet service. Workoutroom was very good, and never crowed. The Hamburgers, Fries and Mashed Potatoes were good from the hotel resturant (if you like a southern flare) It is a French hotel and they cook in the french style.

We got a taxi from Newark airport to the hotel which cost $80 (including tolls and tip). The hotel is about a 100m walk from the centre of Times Square so is in an ideal location! Although we didn't pay extra for a view of Times Sq, we could still see part of it and had a good view anyway. There were a coupel metro stations very close to the hotel which took you anywhere in Manhattan. We paid $27 for a 7 day metro pass which was well worth it. The hotel lobby is on about the 5th floor which is very modern and inviting. There is a large restaurant (Cafe Nicole) and an outdoor terrace which overlooks Times Square and is very fashionably styled. We ended up enjoying drinks out here most nights rather than bothering with any other bars. Definitely one of the best views of any bar in Manhattan. Our room was very spacious. We asked for a twin room which comprised of 2 double beds (a double bed each!!) and a large bathroom. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were cleaned daily. There was a new flatscreen TV with loads of channels and the option of pay movies. We also had a large wardrobe, a powerful hairdryer in the bathroom and an iron and ironing board. The only ever so slight problem was the shower was slightly erratic but still quite powerful. Although we overlooked a busy road on the edge of Times Square, the windows were soundproof so we slept soundly the whole time. The air conditoning was lovely and cool. We didn't pay the rather extortionate price of $20 per day for breakfast; instead we went to a place about 50 metres up the road called 'Cosmic Diner' every day for breakfast. It was reasonably priced and did everything you could imagine for breakfast.

Philosophical contemplation aside, it is basically as close as possible to TS without dumping you in the middle of the hordes. When we arrived at the hotel at just 5:00 AM, there was no one at the front desk. We tried shouting into the back room but they pretended not to hear us. Eventually a bar tender appeared and he went into that same room we were shouting in and dragged out a very sleepy employee who very clearly did not want to be there or help us. We booked two rooms with two double beds: We got two rooms with a king in each. We went back to the front desk to complain to a different guy who appeared and he was the rudest, coldest, most disnterested clerk I have ever encountered. Let's just say our request wasn't met and we put up with the kings for the rest of our stay. Another request that didn't get met was at least one room overlooking TS, but that had a happy side-effect of getting a near unobstructed view of the 4th of July fireworks. As for the room itself, while clean (and quite large for NYC), it was in desperate need of renovation. The bed covers are of the old colored variety, which I thought had been phased out in most hotels at least a few years ago. All furniture and walls were scuffed, dented, nicked, and in general really tired. Gaps were appearing in the cheap-looking ceiling panels, and some of them were filled in with some ugly paste that made the ceiling look worse! At least the TV was very new. Another annoyance was an internet connection that would cut out every 2 minutes. The bathroom was also large and well-appointed, but again looking pretty tired and mold was starting to grow in the shower. The nicest amenity of the hotel was the 7th floor terrace overlooking Times Square. Just bring some company and chill out for an evening watching Times Square go from light to darkness. All the seating was comfy and there seemed to be a good selection of drinks if you're into that. After our previous experiences with the staff, we were too scared to try the restaurant, but what I do know is that breakfast is outrageously expensive (think $20 per person) given all the options at your doorstep. If all you want is coffee and good pastries, try the Starbucks across the street - there it costs $20 for a family of 4! Given the price we paid, I don't think we got a bad deal, but I can't recommend staying here if renovations don't happen soon.

Our flight was not until late in the evening, so the hotel minded our luggage for $1 per bag until we were ready to collect. They also suggested a car to take us to Newark airport for $75 including tolls which we took, but would probably get a taxi instead as it wasn't much different! We found out on the last day that travellers cheques can be exchanged for cash without a commission charge (providing it is no more than $200/room/day). Rooms were a little dated but clean and comfortable. We had a room on the 16th floor which overlooked Broadway and Times Square (if you put your cheek to the window!) We didn't have breakfast so could not comment on that, but had some lovely pancakes and eggs most mornings at Cosmic Diner on the corner of 52nd and 8th Ave. The hotel has a nice outdoor bar which overlooks times square and Broadway. Most evenings they had 'happy hour' (usually 5-7pm) and had certain spirits 2 for 1, such as Absolut Vodka. Sometimes we struggled to get a seat, but the staff were very helpful in rearranging chairs to provide you with somewhere to sit.

We visited the TKTS office near South Street Sea Port which had a queue of approx 10 minutes and still had the same selection of musicals and shows on offer.

A couple block only to Firth Avenue shops and Rockefeller Square. the people in New York were so friendly and polite. Also helpful. Anyone who sees you with a map, will ask if they can help you. Tip - to see the Statue of Liberty take the city bus down Broadway ($2) to the end and get off at the Staten Island ferry terminal. Walk onto ferry (free) and sail across to the island. You go right past the Statue. Just walk off the ferry and get back on again at the other side and you will see the Statue a second time. We went across while still sunny, and came back as the sun was setting. We got some great photos. Did not have to spend a lot of money on a harbour tour to Liberty. Other great area sto explore are Canal Street, Greenwich Village, Soho, Macy's and we took the same bus down Broadway to all those areas for $2. You can ask for a transfer and use it to get onto another bus going back the other way (or another location) within 2 hours, I believe. Great way to get around New York quickly and cheaply!

Bathroom was clean and the safe was easy to use. Only several minor concerns. The key cards used to open doors are very sensitve to being wiped by cell phones or even other bank cards. Always keep your key in a seperate pocket otherwise you will find yourself going to the check in counter regulary. Speaking of which the check in is on the 9th floor which you have to get a lift to and then another lift to your room. I didn't find this a problem until a coach arrives (only 2 lifts to lobby) but this only happened once and we didn't wait long. The television channels had rather grainy pictures and limited channels (around 15 in total). Not really a massive issue with all the entertainment in area. Refreshments cabinet was very expensive and be warned not to remove anything as you will be charged as soon as the item is moved. On a final note the tap in the bathroom was broken and was rather fiddly to get working. Very good hotel and I would definately go again. In relation to other hotels in the Manhattan the price is very affordable and with its location you can walk to most attractions. The hotel has masses of diners in the area at good prices ($25-35 for two person breakfast, $30 - $45 for two person Dinner)", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, NS", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for a NYC Stay\u201d", "Author": "Dan-Hfx", "ReviewID": "UR29493627", "Content": "We stayed here in November 2008, the good - the location is great, close to Times Square, theatre, Central park , Radio City music hall, basically everything that a tourist wants to see in NYC.

The room seemed fine enough, though the two elevator access is a bit of a minor annoyance. Up 5 or 6 floors, across the lobby, then up again to your room. Picture this, you are tired, you finally get to go to bed, you climb in and your feet slide between the crisp sheets to go right off the sheet and onto a gross coarse mattress pad, straps and mattress. What the HELL? You tear up the bed to find that if you remake the bed (isn't this someone elses job?) to actually cover the bottom of the mattress, now your head is on the exposed mattress. Not sure what's worse, or more of a health concern, everyone's bare face on the bare mattress, or feet? I guess they get Queen sized sheets cheap or something. So I had to sleep diagonally finally to keep myself on clean sheets rather than rough mattress surface. The next night I get back after work stuff and check to see they've done it again. I call housekeeping to complain, and they sent up someone with new sheets. They act like I'm nuts. \"This is how we always do it!\" the proclaim. \"But don't you understand, the sheet is too small!\" They get new sheets and they are also too small. I explain well then at least put down two overlapping sheets for the bottom and another as a top sheet so I can sleep tonight. They do that, and I notice that the top sheet she has found is actually a big one. I point out that Look, clearly sheets exist that will cover the bed, so what's with the small ones? She doesn't really understand my insanity, i guess, but I let it go cause I just want to be able to sleep on a clean surface (call me crazy).

That's MY NEW YORK For me is a totally strategic place, due to the subway lines, the Whole Foods @ the Warner Towers Mall - where I eat breakfast fast enough with great natural juice - the lincoln center, the nice walk along Central Park South 'till the 5th av and the East Side, the proximity to broadway theatres without being in the the middle of the Times SQ mess. And that hotel is not(thank god) really at times sq. It is located in the corner of 52th and broadway, close enough to MY NEW YORK. I loved that. About the hotel: the lobby is not on the floor level, which is good to separate us from the street crowd, and it's a nice looking lobby with a great terrace overlooking times sq. Our room was poorly decorated, but clean and big enough(we have stayed in a tiny boutique room once in nyc and it was hell because of the lack of space for clothes, shopping bags and luggage). They gave us a high foor room with a nice times sq view, as I requested, even though I was a \"Priceline guest\", what I guess gives them simpathy credits. By the way, hotel staff was very nice all along our stay. Although the \"priceline price\" was not really cheap - US285/night - I was quite satisfied with my stay at Novotel.

I called the hotel to make reservations and they transferred me to a central reservations agent. I explained to the agent that we wanted a room with a view of the parade. Being from New York he was very knowledgable of the city and spent time with me discussing on which room would be best, etc. He made the reservations viewing time square for 3 nights at a rate of $389.00, $344.00 and $344.00 that could be cancelled. Expensive not by NY prices and well worth it. I also made reservations (on line) for April to celebrate my nieces 16th birthday. Although I was given a confirmation number I never received an e-mail confirmation as I did for my April reservation. So, this morning I called the hotel direct to request an e-mail confirmation only to find out the following: 1. Our room that the agent reserved is not considered a viewing room for the parade. 2. The central reservations agents are not supposed to reserve rooms 'with views' of the parade route. 3. The room we would want cost $200 more a night and was non refundable. Needless to say we are extremely disappointed with the lack of communications between the hotel and their central reservations staff. If I hadn't called for an e-mail confirmation we would have arrived in November without a 'room with a view'. I decided to cancel the November and April reservations at the Novotel.

The remaining nights were spent at the W Hotel New York on Lexington Avenue and the Empire Hotel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve completed separate reviews of each hotel, my favorite hands down being the Empire Hotel. First impression: After three-nights in a suite at the W Hotel, I loathed the idea of downgrading to this hotel. Even though it cost me nothing to say here since it was billed at the expense of my companion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employer, I almost wanted to pay to stay somewhere else. Upon entering the hotel, guests have to take the single working elevator up to the seventh floor, where you will find the reception desk. Check-in was efficient; although I was dubious the hotel only had two rooms for our offering. We had booked a king superior room, but were offered a noisy king by the elevator with a terrible view, or double beds on a higher floor with a great view of Time Square. We opted for the later. If views and proximity to Time Square are important, I can understand why one would stay here because the hotel clearly delivered on its promise of sweeping views of Time Square. Adjacent to the lobby is a wonderful outdoor wrap around terrace. I would imagine it would be a prime location to observe the legendary Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thanksgiving and Christmas Day parade and the New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve festivities. On the other hand, if views are not your chief concern, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why on earth anyone would pay over $800 for a two nights stay (especially given that September is probably considered a shoulder travel season and there are a plethora of more upscale accommodations offering more bang for your buck) .

We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food but we had a couple of drinks at the bar and the prices compared quite favourably with those in local bars (which we found quite expensive......$14approx for a beer and a wine) and at the hotel they give you a bowl of snacks (similar to Bombay mix) with your drink. We stayed for seven nights, and the hotel is very favourably located, being close to all the Broadway theatres and Times Square in one direction and Central Park in the other.

I am a huge believer in TripAdvisor and I research all my travel options diligently. I try to be very fair and balanced when leaving a review so that others can actually benefit from my experiences. So here it is........ PROS- FANTASTIC LOCATION. Loved it, loved it. Just a few short blocks from Times Sq, close to restaurants, cafes, theatres (wicked is literally a block away). Decent size rooms - although rooms were not \"modern\" or trendy they were a decent size ( i have stayed in rooms in manhattan that were the size of closets) and they were clean even though they were older. Service - staff were helpful, check in and out was smooth. Patio - hotel had a decent outdoor lounging area, great to sit and have a drink after a long day in the city CONS - I cannot stress this enough folks - the elevators were insanely loud!! LOUD. So loud in fact that I did not sleep at all the first two nights. The third night they finally had another room available that they moved us to. And even though it was on a differnt floor and away from the elevators we could still hear the clanging and banging of the elevators, this time it may have been the service elevators which were directly across from us. Not quite as loudly as before, but enough that I needed to buy ear plugs and could still hear them. I checked dozens and dozens of reviews before booking this hotel and not one review commented on this issue. Not one, that is until I checked today and say that someone who stayed at the Novotel last week had the same comment. I was very dissapointed. My partner and I are very reasonable travellers and he has travelled quite a bit and he can sleep through pretty much anything, however, by the second night as the noise became louder and louder even he was tired and cranky. I do not exagerate when I tell you the noise from those elevators was over the top and impossible to sleep through. I sincerely reccomend you avoid any rooms by the elevators. Other than that no real cons at all.

No room was more than 1 hallway down from the elevator with straight sight lines. Hair dryer was an older Conair model with a \"slow blow\" and there was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom...on the other hand, the bathroom was very well lit, and had a ceiling fan to avoid steaming the whole room.

The day started out kind of rough. We missed our flight and all we had to do was call the hotel and they kept it for us untill midnight which was great. Our view of Times Square was amazing. It's really nice to go to a clean hotel after a long day of running around New York and just be able to look out the window to Times Square. If you can afford to pay extra for the view, it's worth it. But if you can't that's okay too because the hotel is really nice. The only thing about the hotel is that they didn't have a cofee maker in the room. My mom would have to go down to the restaraunt they have and buy a cup of coffee for about 4 bucks and the breakfast is super expensive for cold cereal. It's around 15 bucks and 20 bucks if you want toast or eggs. But there is a McDonalds literally around the corner which was nice because I love their bisquits. They had a fridge in the room but it was motion censered so if you opened it, you were charged. They didn't have a microwave either. That didn't matter to us because any food brought to our room was eaten. :D But that might be a problem to some people who might just want to keep their food fresh. Also when you check in they charge you a 100 dollars just in case of damage or whatever but they put it back your bank account once you check out. The Theatre for \"Wicked\" is literally across the street which was so nice. Expecially if you don't know your way around NYC and you have to search for your theatres. When you check out the door men are really nice and call cabs for you. The rooms were clean, large, and smelled nice. :D They were always clean when we came back to the room after walking around NYC all day. The location is absolutly amazing. You're right there right at Times Square and everything is close. Also do spend the money on the City Bus Tours that are close to the hotel. They are completley worth the money. We were there 3 days but the first day we didn't do anything because we came in late but for 2 days we did not miss one thing on that island. The men are dressed in blue or red. There are two different busses but they take you to the same places. Really worth the money. For 50 bucks a person you get a entire tour of the city with hop on hop off features to you can stop anywhere you want for two days. A ticket to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty (which we didn't do, just because not enough time in the day) and a ticket to a museum of your choice. The Late show with David Letterman is super close. Walk out the hotel and take a left and boom you're there. The location is amazing. Can't knock the hotel, really.

Negatives: room temperature was 90+ degrees for 4 of my 7 days until I finally called maintenance. Seems the hotel can either have it on \"hot\" or \"cold\", so despite following the instructions for the thermostat the room wasn't cooling down - it was doing the opposite. After it was reprogrammed the temp was great! Also, there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, repeat NO TEA/COFFEE FACILITIES IN ROOM!! I have never stayed in a hotel that doesn't at least have a coffee maker. Bit of a pain when your 3yr old is asleep and you want a cuppa and the deli is 25 floors down and across the street. Minibar in room - if you remove items to use the space for other items (like fruit for the kids) you are automatically charged for the item, as the fridges are sensored. Seems there is a warning on the fridge but after close inspection of my fridge I still couldn't find the warning. On checking out was presented with a bill for several hundred dollars for bar/restaurant services. Except we never once dined or drank in the hotel. Seems there is no system for checking people are giving correct room numbers to the bar when ordering drinks/food. So you could be paying for someone else's stuff. Didn't find the concierge particulary friendly when asking about laundry facilities, check in desk were going to put us all (3 adults, 1 child) in one room, despite us having 2 rooms booked and paid for. Overall, it was an OK hotel, excellent location, walking distance to most of the major sites. Subways are very easy to use (I have been going to New York for 15 years and never had a problem) and safe, although do be cautious at night and stand where the ticket booth can see you. Take the bus tours - they are fantastic value, hop on n hop off. Take the downtown tour, get off at Battery Park for Statue of Liberty, then get back on bus when you're ready and continue the tour. For Statue/Ellis Island, get downtown early as there can be a rather large queue (security). Personally, I would get the Staten Island ferry (free) to sail past the Statue - I don't think it's worth the hassle of queuing, and I certainly wouldn't spend the time lining up to go inside and up it!! One last piece of advice to the New York virgin - don't be fooled into thinking you must eat at big name restaurants. We always go to the Olympic diner on 8th Ave between 48/49th streets. Breakfast here for all 4 of us was $25ish, breakfast for 1 in the Novotel - $20. You do the math!! Sure, try the all singing all dancing restaurant, but if you eat out like this for every meal you will be very skint very soon!!!

Our room was normal sized for a room with two double beds - plenty of room to walk around. The bathroom was good sized also. The room was clean and quiet, the service at breakfast was terrific and our check-in went smoothly. The few things that bugged me were: 1.) the use of flat sheets for fitted sheets. They always end up coming loose if you turn at all while sleeping, so it made sleeping slightly uncomfortable. 2.) The heat never got warm enough, so rather than have it blow out somewhat cool air, I just kept it turned off while we slept. 3.) The lobby was an elevator ride up from street level. Sometimes that was a little annoying - not being able to just walk right out. 4.) I didn't really see a bellman available to help hail a taxi.

The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was nicely sized (I'd stayed in The Paramount at this time last year and the room was not nearly as large). The view was extraordinary. The sound was not bad at all for Manhattan (either from my adjacent rooms or from the street - partially as I was up on the 25th floor.) The most outstanding characteristic, I'd say, however, was the overall cleanliness of the room, the common areas, even the business center. Check in/check out was easy. In nicer weather (it snowed while I was there), I'd suggest availing yourself of the outdoor patio at the lobby level overlooking Times Square. Negatives: Time to upgrade the bed linens from the bedspreads and wool blankets of old. Lots of bleach marks and other stains on the carpets in and outside the room. General - could probably use a slight update, but really not offensive. Room temperature was really not adjustable via the thermostat and permanently registered at 76 degrees F (no matter whether I changed the heat or air setting.)

We weren't at all disappointed. Room 1501 provided us with two large and comfortable queen beds, a convenient bathroom and a view over Broadway.

We had a twin double which was 2210 and looked onto broadway, the room was great, clean, tidy to the same standard as hotel rooms in the uk ( of this price range). The hotel was probably decorated in the mid to late 90's. the bath sealant maybe slightly discoloured but nothing for you to think you would want to leave before unpacking your bags. If you want a top class hotel then book into the Marriot etc. The Novotel is a good hotel for the right price. The rooms were cleaned everyday, the windows open slightly for a bit of fresh air. The hotel doesnt have kettles but if you go to the restaraunt they will give you hot water in a nice flask for you to take to your room to make coffee. The taxi from JFK to the hotel was $49 set price including tolls. The hotel conceirge got us us 4x4 blacked out windows, leather seats, limo type car to go to JFK this cost us $55, the extra $6 was completely worth it. The location of the hotel is great, right in the middle of things, Times square visibly to the south and Central park about 5 minutes walk to the north. 5th Avenue was about 5 mins walk away. Rockerfellor centre was around 5 minutes away (top of the rock is a must). The Taxis are not expensive, it costs around $13 form wall street area to times Sq. If you use the tourist hop on hop off buses, get a two day pass for $50 eachwhch gives all the 3 routes, You must haggle with the sales men on the street and you (they are on Broadway in red coats) will get a free extra day, they just sign the top of the ticket for you.

Having read mixed reviews before going, we had been nervous of what we would find. But on arrival we were greeted with a big smile, helpful information and a speedy and efficient service. The lifts that some people have complained about were not a problem for us at all. There is a lift from the street level up to the lobby and then to get to the rooms you need to walk across the lobby to a different set of lifts. I suppose in the summer when the hotel is packed then you might have to wait for a lift occasionally but this wasn't an issue off-peak season and isn't something we would have even thought about if I hadn't been looking out for it after the reviews. The lobby and bar/restaurant itself is elegant with a magnificent view over Times Square. And the rooms, whilst not plush, and perhaps starting to wear at the corners, were extremely spacious and clean with unfussy decoration. There was also a safe in the room which was nice as most of the hotels we've come across in the US previously did not. The photos on here and on the Novotel website are on the whole a fair representation of what we found during our trip. Contrary to popular advice we also opted for the hotel breakfast and again were glad we did. There are of course thousands of delis and diners out there to try, but at the same time, Novotel offered a good quality buffet breakfast where you could help yourself to as little or much as you wanted (cold and hot food as well as as a good range of drinks) and enjoy the view at your leisure before heading out into the mayhem, fuelled for the day. Staying here you really are right in the heart of it all - on the top edge of Times Square you are never far from home and after a long day walking miles around the sights, to be able to see the Novotel sign shining through the neon haze was both comforting and inspiring! It is also worth mentioning that the hotel is very conveniently located across the block from 7th Avenue subway stop on the E line. (Although this doesn't appear to be mentioned on their website anywhere.) This meant that transfer from JFK airport to the hotel was actually very easy (Air Train to Sutphin Blvd [which is the end of the line] and then straight on to the subway E line, getting off at 7th Avenue.). At a total of $7 per person this was a LOT cheaper than taking a taxi or shuttle bus and possibly quicker at about 45 mins door to door. Don't panic when you find yourself on the Airtrain platform at JFK with no ticket - all tickets are purchased at the other end before they let you out! You can even buy a single tichet there that covers both the air train and subway in one go. Overall, I can't recommend this hotel enough and will certainly stay here again whenever we next return.

The concierge was incredibly unhelpful, when we asked about simple transport solutions he simply said \"take the subway\". The bar staff were also rude. One waiter took offence because we requested food in the bar area and simply walked away from us. And no one in the hotel seemed to have any sense of urgency, we were constantly left waiting around while they took their time at doing the simplest of tasks. The rooms themselves were basic but terribly dated. We were on the 27th floor and had a nice view of Times Square but apart from that I was left underwhelmed.

They ended up charging my entire stay to my DEBIT card and left my credit card empty - even though there was no confusion at the desk and they TOOK my credit card and SAID they charged the room to it. This resulted in my checking account being totally wiped clean and putting me in the red - the rest of my vacation I was declined everywhere I tried to use my card because of this stupid error. I was humiliated when I actually had the money. There was no mistake, this was not an error on my part, this was completely due to whatever mistakes were made by the people at the reservations desks. They were nice but, this has been completely unacceptable. I am working on rectifying this now but the damage has been done and my credit has been soured for no reason.

The bathroom was adequate, but a bit in need of modernising. The rest of the room looked fine to me, and the maids seemed to keep it clean each day. We had a great view from our room of Times Square also, which we hadn't asked for in particular. My only grumble would be the less than helpful staff (apart from the cleaners who seemed friendlier than the rest of the staff), who didn't seem too friendly or helpful when checking in/ out. We never had any cause to use them otherwise though, as we had no problems. Maybe they are just trying to get you used to the general rudeness of people in New York ;)", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Fritza", "ReviewID": "UR10131894", "Content": "First the location... hard to beat West 52nd St, just off Broadway, especially for a New York first timer.

The rooms are clean and basic but in need of redecorating. This did not bother us too much as we simply used the room for somewhere to wash and sleep!! The beds were comfortable and the maids did a great job each day. You could opt to have clean towels everyday if you wished. Its in a great location, just of Time Square so is within walking distance of plenty of attractions (and most importantly Macy's!). My only complaint about this hotel (and this is being REALLY picky) is that you have to take an elevator up from street level to the lobby which is on the seventh floor, then you have to walk across the lobby and get in another elevator to your room. The elevator from the street to the lobby is extremely slow and at one point I thought I had got stuck! We found having to catch this extra elevator a little inconvenient after hours of shopping and sightseeing when all you want to do is go to your room!

Unusually the lobby is on the ground floor and you then take a lift to the 9th floor for reception. The reception area is open plan with the bar and restaurant and looks as if it has been done fairly recently; it works well visually although we did not eat at the restaurant so can't comment on the service or food. The rooms are not so modern and could do with a coat of fresh paint on the woodwork but more importantly they were clean and quiet. The reception staff were welcoming and friendly without being over the top and happily waived the extra charge for a couple of drinks from the mini bar which had not shown up on their system.

There is a fantastic diner directly underneath the Novotel who do fantastic breakfasts (pancakes, waffles) and if you have dinner here, have the pizza burger! I haven't tasted a better burger since! Another great restaurant to go to in Bubba Gumps in Times Square - it is a \"Forrest Gump\" themed restaurant that has lots of fab food and a great atmosphere! If you can take in a Broadway Show - many of the theatres are located on or just off Times Square so you don't need to walk far to get to one and there is a ticket booth on Times Square where you can buy reduced price tickets (sometimes as much as 50%) for tickets for showings that night - try and go early as there are large queues and good seats can get snapped up.

Drinks were a little on the pricey side but managable. The best part of this hotel was its location, centrally located off Broadway, only a short stroll from Times Square-fantastic.

The staff sing as you enjoy your breakfast etc... a real novelty at great prices. Here are a few tips. 1. Airport Taxis-avoid the touts and unlicenced cabbies-one tried to charge us $87. Use the licenced Yellow cabs who by law charge a flat rate of $45 from the airports to manhatten. In addition there will be a toll charge of $4.50 and a tip on top. 2. If you are staying in New York and are thinking of hiring a car-DON'T. The blocks are gridlocked most of the time, the traffic is often at a stand still. Use yellow cabs-they will know the best alternative routes-or the metro. The metro is cheap, air conditioned and extremely safe. We did not see a hint of trouble during our time in New York-the city has cleaned up its act. 3. I would recommend a helicopter flight around Manhatten, there are two or three companies but we used Helicopter Flight Services, Pier 6, South Street, Downtown-thoroughly professional and a slick outfit. Book from your home via the internet in advance though. 4. Everyone expexts a tip-from barman to bell boys, from waiters to room service-I'll leave that one with you........

Our room was 2512 which faced Broadway with a great view of Times Square. The room was an average standard size, nothing spectacular, but was clean and neat. I was disappointed that a coffee pot was not in the room, as I love to have that cup of caffine first thing in the morning. However, the Art Cafe on the first floor of the Hotel building provided a good breakfast and a reasonable price. Get a map of Manhattan from the concierge and let him/her know what you are most interested in seeing. They will point you in the right direction. You can cover a lot of territory by foot, but make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Day 1 we walked through Times Square to Rockefeller Center, then over to the Empire State Building, then Grand Central Station, back to the Novotel for a little break and then walked to Central Park. Took the 30 minute carriage ride through a very small area of the park. Cost was $40, a little pricey, but worth it. Saw Mama Mia in the evening. Theater was located across from the Novotel. Excellent! After the show we walked to Carnagie Deli, for the biggest sandwich I've ever seen. We ordered the corned beef and pastrami and it was 6 inches high. Unbelievable!! Day 2 we took the subway to Ground Zero. You can catch the subway at 7th avenue, take the E train Downtown. Ground Zero is the end of the line. After spending time at Ground Zero, we walked to Battery Park, saw the Statue of Liberty, then walked to Pier 17 where there is plenty of shops and activities. Took The Shark speed boat ride..highly recommend, gets you up close to the Statue of Liberty, $20/person for adult, 30 minute ride. You get WET! Then walked back to Ground Zero, took subway back to Novotel. Go to Restaurant Row on 46th street between 8th and 9th, many ethnic groups represented and several jazz clubs too. We ate at Swing 46, live jazz entertainment, no cover, great food, reasonably priced. If there is someplace special you want to visit in New York, the Novotel staff will help get you there. Gerard, the bartender, was a hoot in the Lounge. Everyone made sure you experienced outstanding customer service.

It was a great Hotel. When you enter the hotel at ground level, you then have to take the lift up a few floors to the reception (to about the 7th floor i think, but its easy to do as if i recall, its the only place the lift goes) though when its busy with lots of new people coming in, there can be a queue for the lift but it goes pretty quick. Once out of the lift you have the recption up ahead of you, the staff where very nice and friendly and answered any questions we had. Over to the left is the bar and eating area. We did get a round of drinks in once, but it was pretty expensive so it was a one off. im not sure about the food and how much it costs, but i've heard its nice but pretty expensive too. However dont let this put you off as most people do not eat in the hotel, as there is no need to given that at the bottom of the hotel and in the surrounding areas are reasonably priced diners for breakfast, lunch even dinner, not to mention the thousands of other eating establishments further afield, yet still only 10-15min walks. Id particularly recommend going to the stardust diner, just over the way from the hotel, the waiters/waitresses are aspiring singers/dancers trying to make it to broadway and each take it in turn to sing songs and entertain you whilst carrying on serving! Worth at least one trip i'd say, could probably be a bit too much though if you went more than once (especially if you've had a few the night before!!) Back to the Novotel, the rooms were good they were cleaned eveyday to a good standard and the cleaners were always friendly whenever we saw them. The room was a very decent size and we had the most spectacular view of times square (we were on the times square side) as the hotel is just on the outskirts of the main hub of it. We were on the 31st floor, it was really high up, but when you get over the initial shock of how high up you are, its an amazing view. Considering where you are, you can not hear any noise and there are blackout curtains so the light doesnt wake you too early in morning. There is a balcony area on the same floor as reception, if you do decide to have a drink or just a relax and sit down after a busy day, which has views overlooking times square. There was security at the hotel, they were there later in the evening and when we got in of a night when sometimes they would ask you to show your key card. During the day there were the guys who help you with your baggage who on the last day, kept our baggage (9 cases) in the storage room for about 13 dollars, he gave us tickets for our baggage and it stayed there until we returned later that day to collect it!!

We were originally meant to go in November (booked then through expedia) but I was taken ill. The hotel was non-refundable however with a letter from my doctor confirming the situation they and expedia agreed to refund the room cost (probably helped being a busy time of year, I am sure they were able to rent it again!) So on that first great impression we decided to book with them again (this time direct, as expedia did not have any availability). Unfortunately the day we were due to travel, was the day of heavy snow and our flight from Gatwick to Newark was cancelled. We telephoned and explained the situation and they were very accommodating; we arrived 1 day late, still stayed for 5 nights, and half expected that we might have to pay for the extra \"missed\" night, but we didn't, which was great. In my opinion the hotel was good, I guess just an average hotel, nothing quirky or unusual but it was clean, and we were able to see Times Square from our room. Lets face it, who goes to New York to spend all day in the hotel! On the bus tours (would definitely recommend you do that) we went past some other hotels which we had been considering and they didn't see to be near anything in particular! In this price range I would definitely say the Novotel wins on location. The Marriott Times Square looked great but unfortunately was out of our price range as we wanted to stay for 5 nights to do everything we wanted to. One thing I would say is that there are no tea/coffee making facilities so if you like to have this, better take your own kettle! We ate breakfast in the hotel a couple of times; having stayed in central London I thought $20 (less than \u00c2\u00a311 when we stayed) for breakfast was a pretty good deal!

On entering the room, I was pleasantly surprised at the appearance of it, given the relatively low price of the hotel. The room was plain but clean and functional. Two particularly cheap and nasty pictures didn't do much to brighten it up - and neither did the obligatory low level lighting (why is it that hotel rooms never have decent lighting?). There was however functioning, adjustable air conditioning, a remote control TV, an armchair (no table though), clean bedding, a small safe, mini-bar, iron and board and a decent size bathroom with supplies of toiletries and a hairdryer. We did however notice that the bath, although clean enough to use, was not cleaned to the standard you'd clean your own bath (the odd hair left etc) and so required a rinse around from time to time. In addition, the shower was fixed at too low a level for us and so directed a blast of water directly at your throat! An ice machine and shoe-shine machine was also located just outside the elevators. As it turned out, our room was at the end of the corridor and so the only other people to reach our door were the occupants of the room opposite. This, coupled vith the very low traffic noise levels at 25th floor level made for a surprisingly quiet stay. I normally always use earplugs in hotels and certainly wasn't expecting to sleep as well as I did without them in New York! The view from our room wasn't great - an office block opposite in which you could easily see the occupants (so I guessed they could just as easily see us), and a road junction below. You don't go to New York to sit looking out of your hotel room window though and so this really wasn't a problem. As many others have pointed out, the lack of coffee making facilities in the rooms was disappointing however there was a Starbucks just across the road so again, it wasn't a huge problem. Although the hotel does have it's own bar and restaurant, prices appear a bit high, particularly considering the plentiful supply of other restaurants, diners and bars within a few hundred yards. As a result, we never used the hotel bar or restaurant. We did use the small shop (located next to reception) and found they had a good choice of souveniers, drinks and sweets (sorry, candy!) as well as necessities such as tissues, toiletries, medical supplies etc. Payphones are located in the lobby and, on the one occaison that we used the concierge (we booked a helicopter trip and harbor cruise directly by phone and bought discount show tickets ourselves from TKTS under the Marriot Marquis), we found the service very good. Other than the lack of coffee making facilities and the occasional wait for an elevator from ground level to the reception, my only other gripe would be the fish that are kept in small square vases on reception - the vases look far too small and it seems cruel to keep a single fish in such confined space. Other than that, if you are looking for a great value, great location hotel and don't necessarily want the height of luxury, then look no further than the Novotel.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cFine place to stay\u201d", "Author": "dnote", "ReviewID": "UR7260935", "Content": "just fine... clean and very well located.

There were 15 of us and this is what caused the problem. It seems that thomas cook and the hotel did not have a very good communication with each other and as a result our check in was not a very pleasant experience. The guy at check in could not find our bookings and it took over two hours to finally check in properly. This was not very good considering we had been travelling all day on two flights. We were sent to the wrong rooms twice, the staff tried to put four of us in a room with one bed and two of us were even put in an already occupied room! The staff at the desk were very unhelpful, and their false politeness seemed very patronising after two hours of trying to check in! they even retreated to a back room in order to hide from us even though I managed to stay polite throughout the episode (I was dying to shout and scream!) So all I can say is if you are going as a large group it might be very difficult so make sure you arrange it specifically with your travel agent and confirm guests names beforehand, possibly confirming directly with the hotel would be a good idea. Apart from our terrible check in the hotel is fine. Clean, large rooms, nice food in the restaurant, great service at the bar, lovely wait staff and great concierge staff. Great hotel for couples or families on a budget who want somewhere nice to stay for their visit to the city. Oh and the location of the hotel is absolutely excellent.

The room was bigger than the other hotel rooms I've stayed in in New York City and had two double beds in it. It was clean and well kept, with a mini-fridge and colour tv. There was plenty of drawer space, and the wardrobe had a personal safe in it. There is a gift shop downstairs, as well as an informal cafe bar with some fabulous views of Times Square. One tiny thing about the gift shop - it sold chocolate and crisps but no drinks. However there is a pharmacy right down the street which is open 24/7 which sells a multitude of soft drinks, as well as beer etc... We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, instead we ate at the Art Cafe at street level right next to the hotel. The staff there were friendly and fast and the food was excellent. There is also a McDonald's down the street and various other cafe's, deli's and restaurants to choose from. The location was great, and we had no problem getting taxi's to wherever we needed to go. When we checked out we stored our luggage downstairs at a cost of $1 per item and picked it up again when it was time to go back to the airport.

For the price it was well worth it, the hotel's website always has deals it seems. I had a king room on the 22nd floor, no complaints. Room was good size, nice hard wood floor in the bathroom, though the shower pressure will blow you across the tub, it's powerful. Comfortable bed, small sitting area with a couch, chair and table, minibar, desk, TV, iron, safe, alarm clock, only thing missing was coffee pot. There's no high speed internet access, only wireless, which I don't have, so I had to plug in my laptop via dialup, which worked great. There is a business center that has high speed though if you really need it. Wireless has a daily fee. My view was of the theatres which are nearby, Hairspray, Jersey Boys and Wicked. I can't comment on the restaurant or room service, as I didn't use either, but there is some cheap restaurants nearby if your looking for them, like the cafe/diner that's on the corner right next to the hotel. If you want more expensive outside the hotel, Gallagher's steakhouse is right next door also. The location can't be beat, only a 5 minute walk to Times Square, and the subway is only a couple blocks away. There's a doorman always outside also, and cabs are readily available. I found the staff to be very friendly, especially Kevin the front desk clerk. One downside, and it's really minor, is the two elevators, one from the street to the lobby (7th floor), then from lobby to the rooms, but the elevators come quickly. Late at night, they won't even let you up to the lobby without everyone in your group showing a room key, my friends who weren't staying there were denied access upstairs with me when we came in at 1 AM. I only had one problem during my stay, and that is on the late night I came back, my room key must have de-magnetized, as I tried about 20 times and it didn't work.

We had a double Double Bed room on the 15th floor, and whilst the view was not of times square it was interesting enough (but who goes to New York to look out of a hotel window) The staff were reserved but friendly - the bar and restaurant was a little expensive, but we only had a couple of drinks there anyway (there are so many outside to go to why stay at the hotel) I can recommend the Art Cafe directly below the hotel - just be aware you get mega portions. Also Ellens Stardust diner over the road is good too. For drinks check out Tao, try the Tautini - yummy.42 E 58th Street between Madison and Park Avenues. A restaurant I can recommend (though you will need to get a cab) is La Ripaille (605 Hudson St # 3, New York, NY 10014 ) the owner is french and his wife is from Manchester - food is splendid and the atmosphere brilliant. The room had excellent TV, Iron & Ironing Board and a very handy digital safe - the only thing it was lacking was tea & coffee making facilities, which I found rather unusual, but beacuse I had checked out previous reviews I took my own travel kettle and supplies, so we were sorted (glad I did!) long way out just to nip to McDonalds/Starbucks for a coffee! Shopping is Fab - go to Bloomingdales (though they are a bit snobby in there) and be sure to go to Macys - go to the customer service dept on the Mezanine and if you show them ID (driving licence or Passport) to prove you are from out of town you get an 11% discount card (excludes perfules and some other bits - check the back of the card) Be aware that when you are buying most things in NY they add @ 8.75% tax on top of the price on the goods (not sure if this does not include clothing as I got some T shirts from Old Navy store (near Macys) and they did not add tax. On first day we did all the major tourist things -you should definitely go to the observation deck at the Top of the Rock - brilliant. You are very very high up and you get to still see empire state. We did this during the day - then on the same day at dusk did the Empire state, which is currently looking a little untidy as it;s being done up, but the views were lovely ar dusk. Make sure you only go up on a clear day though or all you'll see is cloud! I would also recommend doing a sightseeing tour on the hop on and hop off busses. You hear a lot of things from the tour guides you would not find out otherwise. The Park is lovely - a lot hillier than I thought. Also check out FAO: Schwartz, they have the giant keyboard from the movie Big (yes I did go on it) Would definitely go back to NY again, now I have done all the sightseeing I can go back just to shop (yippee) One last thing- don't forget - get a Yellow Cab from JFK to any manhatten location for a set price of $45 plus tolls and tips (works out at around $55 in the end) don't go on one of the mini busses that they tout outside the airport as they rip you off", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201c\"Why would you want to go anywhere else?\"\u201d", "Author": "wildmarc", "ReviewID": "UR6829265", "Content": "This is what friends who had stayed at the Novotel had said to us when we were planning our first trip to NY and now after our trip we couldn't agree more.

I didn't find the staff particularly helpful, and there was not a lot of security for a hotel in this location. You take an elevator from the street level to the lobby (7th floor), then have to hop on another set of elevators to get to your room. In all of this moving around, there was no check that you were a guest. On a positive note, there is a Duane Reade drugstore one block away for the necessary water, snacks, etc.. The hotel seems very energy/environment conscious, which means everything is on a sensor. When you leave your room, the heat cuts off, so I was cold during my stay.

Seeing as the basic room rate at this hotel is $299 per night, it's a great bargain if you can book far enough in advance. The best thing about the Novotel is its location which couldn't really be better, just a few blocks up from Times Square. It's not just the proximity to Times Square though, this location means you can pretty much get to anywhere in Midtown Manhattan within 20 mins walk. Rooms are big for NYC and clean, but a little cold and the bedding is not great. No tea and coffee making facilities which is a bit of a shame when you've been out all day sight seeing. Other than that though, the place is great, friendly staff, good concierge, good check-in/check-out. Bar is nice and the only time they struggled was with the massive crowd in the lobby on New Year's Eve. Having said that, when you consider there were over 1 million people literally right outside on Broadway - getting drinks was going to be tough anywhere that night. Didn't eat at the restaurant other than the night we arrived (food fine, service a bit slack when Maitre D not there) because there is so much more on offer just on the doorstep. This is especially the case for breakfast - think you can get much much more at all the diners and you avoid the queues for brekky too. Whilst you're there you must go and see a show. The standard on Broadway is leagues above West End - we saw Chorus Line - probably the best show we've ever seen for quality. Other highlights we'd recommend would be Little Italy - pretty much all on Mulberry Street near Chinatown - great restaurants and bars. And, instead of spending a whole morning queuing for the Empire State Building, why not try the Top of the Rock observatory at the Rockerfeller Centre - hardly any queue at all, amazing views only 16 floors lower than the deck at the ESB, better views of uptown and downtown, a great view of the ESB itself, and you're in the open air - not squinting through little portholes. Costs about $17 (ESB $18) but just as breathtaking if not better. Helicopter trips are good fun but lots of hassle waiting in the heliport, we waited over an hour to get our 15 min flight. Really good experience though. Best experience: dinner at The View restaurant - this is a revolving restaurant on top of the Marriott Marquise (48th floor), just off Times Square. BOOK IN ADVANCE to get a table - can do it on line from the UK. Quite an expensive meal but so worth it to get all those views, great service, fantastic food. If you go to NYC at New Year, then it's probably best to avoid Times Square - it was absolutlely manic - that's why the Novotel was good because you have a view from their 7th floor terrace of Broadway down to Times Square, and a view of the million + people on Broadway. All in all - a great place, fantastic city, great time of year to go there, and a smart hotel in the best spot.

We are going to stay stay a bit more upmarket newxt time in the hilton time square. We phoned up the week before our trip to confirm a time square view on a high floor, but were told that this could not be gauranteed and if we did get a view it would cost and extra $20 a night. when got there we had the most amazing view of time square on the 24th floor. So on check out we expected to pay the extra but we were not charged! Also on check in many people were being told there rooms were not ready but we just checked in and were able to head straight to our room. 20 mins later we were out exploring New York. didnt use the bar or restaurant so cant comment on that as there are far too many place to eat than in a hotel in new york. had breakfast in the dinner underneath the hotel everymoring as it was convienient. New York. we walked most places but the subway took a while to get used to but worked out ok for longer journeys. highly recommend - top of the rock, only people up there were us - staton island ferry (free, good shots of liberty - night bus tour - empire state buliding - ground zero - very sad place to visit just brought back all those terrible memories. - the american museum of natural history - central park (have a horse drawn ride) shopping - maceys (massive, took 4 visits to see it all) - non new york state residents get a discount in maceys go to the information centre in maceys to get a discount card. - century 21 (next to ground zero) - soho (more expensive shops) shops are everywhere and for every taste and price range. shows - we saw chicago, excellent block up from the hotel. - also went to see a taping of the late show with dave letterman which has been a dream of mine for ages. this made my trip!

We tried to MOVE the dates when we were having SO much trouble getting there from Atlanta (weather and mechanical problems)...not a refund, but just for them to MOVE to the week of Christmas. They told us since we had booked through Priceline, that Priceline had to give them the ok. So, we call Priceline (and that was hard since most of it is automated and after trying 3 numbers) and they say that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the hotels discretion after reading their policy to us. So, we call the hotel, the hotel says Priceline HAS to call them. We call Priceline again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they say they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call the hotel, the hotel should call them (and again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hotels discretion)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6call the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting the picture. The hotel was NOT willing to work with us, and I found them quite hard to deal with. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to give Customer Service a negative 5 on a scale of 0-5. But, once we arrived, check-in was a breeze and our room was REALLY nice. The room was better than expected and beyond expectations based on some of the sizes and reviews of these other hotels. Our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that small and was very adequate for a place to sleep. It was clean and confortable, had a safe, plenty of drawer space, lighting, windows, closet space. The bathroom was as good of a size as anywhere we've ever stayed, Hilton, Hampton Inn, Marriot.... We ordered room service one night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very pricy, but good. Their menu for room service is their menu for that caf\u00c3\u00a9 they have downstairs. To get to the lobby (and this may be how all of the hotels are in NY), but you must enter through revolving doors and take an elevator up 7 floors\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6get off in the lobby then proceed to another block of rooms that I think went up into the 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The only minor issue was the heating\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6like almost non-existent. The outside temps weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad last week, so that helped, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother with the thermostat!! We had it turned up on like 84, next time I look at it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it turned itself down to 80 with an inside temp of 72\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6then I bump it back up to 84, then look at it again and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 74. The room temp never heated to above 70\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6unless we took a HOT shower. Sometimes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just run the water and steam up the place to warm it up some. It may have just been our room, but take a sweatshirt and sweatpants just in case. IT couldn't hurt, but we were comfortable and it really was no different that visiting my parents who keep theirs on 68 or 69 all year. The location was excellent. Times Square was just a block or two\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.our theatre was just up the street\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all the food on 9th avenue was just a couple streets over. NICE NICE NICE!!! A really short walk to everything to do and see in Midtown Manhatten. There was a subway to hit the 1 line a VERY short walk from the hotel. The Art Cafe was right beside our hotel, and there are a lot of bagel and muffin cafe's to dart in and out of nearby. There is also a McDonald's on the same block as our hotel, but it doesn't open until 10:00...so don't expect breakfast or coffee there. Overall I couldn't have been happier with our hotel. I am a very picky person and was THRILLED at the location, the quality of the rooms and the services...though I couldn't complain enough about their staff and how uninviting and unhelpful they were.

We ate one night in the Cafe Nicole in the hotel (on the same floor as the lobby), the food was lovely although the drinks were on the expensive side (40 dollars or about 23 quid(!!) for a bottle of a Chilean Merlot) - check before you order as the menus only list wine prices by the glass! Service in the restaurant was really good and when we asked the waiter if he knew any other good places to eat (girlfriend is vegetarian), he gave us the names of a couple of great restaurants and even printed out directions for us! The hotel is in a perfect location, it's situated right on Broadway, the entrance is just off the main street (on 52nd).

We met one understanding late-night maintenance person (who delivered clean towels to the room). Other than that, the attitude of the staff is universally poor, so it has to be a 'management' thing and not particular individuals.

The first room we checked into was clean and tidy but reaked of cigarette smoke. This was not the fault of the hotel because there are many European people who stay here and have no regard for smoking in a non-smoking room. We called guest services and were immediatley given a new room (#2914). As you are dropped off at the hotel, you'll enter on 52nd street and greeted by bellmen. In order to get to the lobby, you first take an elevator to the 7th floor. Sometimes this can be congested but it wasn't too bad. The main elevators in the lobby going all the way up to our room on the 29th floor ran fast and frequent. I was impressed. Forget about the wonderful views you see posted on websites about looking down Broadway onto Times Square. Probably 75% of the rooms in the Novotel DON'T have great views of Times Squares. My room overlooked the ugly Sheraton Hotel across the street, but that wasn't a bog deal for us. We spent most of our time OUTSIDE the hotel ENJOYING Times Square. But please be advised, if you are going there to hang out in your room to stare out the window at Times Square, ASK IN ADVANCE for a A ROOM WITH A VIEW. I was able to open our window and with some contortion, look out of it and snap a picture with my camera of Times Square, but forget about simply staring out the window onto Times Square for hours at a time. If the Novotel had Bay Windows on the rooms facing Broadway, this Hotel would beat all other New York hotels for the view looking onto Time Square. The location is one of the best for Broadway plays. We saw Phantom of The Opera (my second time) and it was grand. Just a few blocks from the Novotel. Hey, if you are looking for a good laugh, the play \"Tina & Toni's Wedding) a few blocks away was an absolute HOOT! This was one of my best adventures in New York! Go see it and have a grand time and a meal too boot. (I danced with the bride ***and I don't like to dance*** and I also danced with two brides maids. Geeze this was a blast. Our room was very clean and tidy and I was very impressed with the maid service. I tipped here $10 and left gifts of unused subway cards and other things for the maid. Each morning our room was cleaned early and if we returned by lunch, we had a nice clean room. Hey, how about that hot water? You can't believe how fast you get hot water at the sink and shower! No waiting for 5 minutes for a hot shower. They must have a tankless system that heats the water in the room. We both were very happy about this feature. Plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The staff was very helpful and friendly and our check in and check out process was smooth and easy. We NEVER ate at the restuarant in the hotel because there are too many facsinating places in and around the hotel to eat. Our favorite place was the small cafe directly under the hotel at the corner of 52nd and Broadway. The food was very good, the service was grand and the prices were about 70% less than eating at the Novotel. The low point (and I mean REALLY LOW) in staying at the Novotel is the heating and cooling system. We had to call the maintenance staff 3 times because we were BURNING UP in our room. The whole time we were in the room, it was around 78 degrees. We tried to sleep with the windows open, but there is so much noise from the street (even up to the 29th floor) that it was impossible to sleep with an open window. The A/C system at the hotel runs on boilers and chillers (as I suspect many of the hotels are) and it doesn't allow an individual occupant to cool his/her room and the next door neighbor to heat his/her room. Had it not been for this one issue, I would have rated this hotel as OUTSTANDING, but instead, I slept in bed with the sheets off and woke up frequently because I was so hot IN OCTOBER! Lastly, the room was incredibly quiet. The windows are double glazed and when they are shut, you have no idea of the noise outside. Our bed was very comfortable.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cnot so clean!\u201d", "Author": "laperla", "ReviewID": "UR5973203", "Content": "Upon our arrrival at the Novotel, we (a group of 13) had discovered our early check in rooms were not available until 2:00pm.

I am a regular user of this site for booking hotels and this one turned out to be a little off the mark (in my opinion anyway). I have stayed in numerous Novotels in Europe and the rooms are generally clean, reasonably sized and well priced. Boy have they got a lot to learn in Novotel New York about value for money, good service, cleanliness and making you feel welcome. Firstly the positive, the location is excellent, close to all major sites and right in the heart of all the action. When we arrived at 12pm (early) we were told that they could not let us have a room as they were waiting for 'airline staff' as they have priority. Turns out all the Air France crew get in around early lunchtime and they get first priority. Anyway we didn't complain and returned two hours later and were then given a room. The room was on the 14th floor and it was the most dingy , dark, small,smelly room I've ever come across ( on a par with a \u00c2\u00a315 a night blackpool hotel, if you get my drift)The 'double' beds were marginally larger than two singles and it was really uncomfortable if two were sharing the same bed. I travel all over the world with my job so I'm not naive or have unreasonable expectations when it comes to value versus standard of room (particularly in large cities), I immediately asked for a different room and the check in staff weren't that happy with this and told me I would have to wait two hours to change. The second room did have a better view but was still very old worn and smelly (stale urine and dogs). At this point I wanted to change hotels but they'd already got my money ( booked on a no change rate on internet) so was reluctant to throw away this money and the kids were shattered after our long trip so we stuck it out (on the basis that we wouldn't be spending much time in the room anyway). We tried the breakfast one morning and that was a big mistake. It was 10.20 ( breakfast finished at 10.30) and I was unsure if we would be seated. The man in charge of seating said there was no problem and seated us. Anyway when we went to get food some very rude and agressive waiter told us to go away as breakfast was finished. He was literally removing all the food as we were trying to serve ourselves.I had words with him about his attitiude towards my kids and I just got a load of abuse. absolutely ridiculous.......If you do stay make sure you arrive early for breakfast and dont cross the aggresive waiters. The general staff attitude was 'reluctant to serve' and 'service with a grudge' (typical of a french hotel back in the early 90's). They seem to have serious moral issuse and probably need a new manager or refresher course on good hospitality.

We were not happy with the room as it was a special occasion and we wanted everthing to be perfect. We went back to reception to ask for another room and they said Yes to get out bags and wait 4 hour until all other rooms were cleaned. We went out and when we arrived back another person told us there was no rooms for us to have with a view of time sq. Still not happy we waited and spoke to someone else and she said if we wanted a room with a view we would have to pay $100. It was a bit much on top of what we had already paid but it was worth it when we got put in a room. Room 1803 had the most amazing views, it made our trip extra special. It was relaxing just to sit at the window and watch the traffic and when the window was closed we could not hear any noise at all. We also ate in the hotel restaurante and that was amazing, service was very good, but very expensive. Being from Scotland my partner wore his Kilt the night we went to the restaurante and they staff and most guests were so rude, they basically laughed in his face. In other reviews i read how they got champagne or cake on special occasions, but my partner emailed the hotel about my birthdday and i never got any of this in either of my rooms when we arrive. After all the carry on with swapping rooms i was not the staffs favourite person so i tought they were very rude. Over all this hotel was in a fab location, 5 mins from Time Square, 10 mins from 5th avenue and Central Park and it only took us 10 mins to get to Macys and the Empire State Building. The best thing about the hotel was the cleaners, they were in everyday with fresh towels and they cleaned the room amazingly. Never even seen them but that done a great job. The staff are rude and are only there to pick up a wage at the end of the month. If it was not for the location and good rooms they hotel would be poor. Also watch out for the mini bar. We thought it was expensive so we baught out own juice and sweets, took the hotels out and out put ours in the fridge til morning. We did not know that it is electronically detected that anything that gets removed from the fridge goes straight to Reception so we were shocked when we got a bill of $245.

One was the proximity to all areas in Manhattan that we needed to get to by walking. I made the reservation through Expedia and got a very good rate by pre-paying the entire amount 3 weeks before our trip. Anyway, we arrived on Saturday afternoon and were given a room on the 31st floor with a view of the river and a lot of buildings. Now this of course was not what I had envisioned when I made my reservation. I really wanted the Times Square view. It wasn't really for myself because I've been to NYC on many occasions, but it was my girlfriend's birthday and I knew that having that view would be very exciting for her. So after we got to the room, I immediately went back downstairs to the front desk and explained to them my situation. The front desk clerk wasted no time in switching our location from the riverside view on the 31st floor to the Times Square view on the 27th floor. There was no hassle or problems whatsoever and she appeared very happy in being able to accommodate my request. After we got to our room, the view that we had from that location was INCREDIBLE!!!!! I couldn't have asked for better. There was only one thing that was somewhat irritating and that was having to catch an elevator from the street to the lobby and vice versa. But other than that, everything was good. The room was somewhat small, but very cozy and clean. We had a great selection of TV channels as well. We didn't spend a great amount of time in the room however. We were literally steps away from the Broadway Theatre where we saw The Color Purple on Saturday night and 1 block up from Caroline's Comedy Club where we had made reservations for on Sunday evening. All the staff at the hotel were very pleasant from the security guards to the front desk manager. We had a very exciting time and I most definitely would come back and also refer friends and family to the Novotel for future trips to NYC.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrogate, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood VFM (Value for Money)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4773114", "Content": "Once you get over the initial shock of the street level access/lobby and emerge from the lift (8 floors up?) into the reception lobby, you're in for a pleasant surprise.

We got a good deal shopping around on the internet and were drawn to the hotel by a good price and a good location. The hotel itself is extremely well located on 52nd street. Times Square, Central Park etc are all very conveniently located and it was great to be so close to all these key areas. Its a major bonus to be this centrally located and really enhanced our stay (on our last stay in NY we had stayed at a hotel near macy's and found the Novatel's proximity to be a real bonus). The hotel is sufficiently far away to avoid some of the noise and lights of time square and we had no troubles sleeping at night. While we were happy with the location, our room itself was probably a little disappointing. The hotel looks like its due for a re-furbishment and while it's not run down, some of the decor and styling is looking a little dated. While everything was clean and tidy, our guess was the hotel was last redecorated in the early 90's. Our room had clearly had a smoker in it recently and smelt heavily of cigarette smoke, and on our second night we had problems with an overflowing sink. While these things weren't great (and not something you would expect from a large chain like the Novatel) the staff handled the situation well and professionally. Apart from the above we didnt have too many occassions to deal with the staff but when we did everyone was ok but not spectacular, and service was basic but courteous. Housekeeping however did a great job of cleaning our room every day. It's worth pointing out that you are required to take 2 lifts to get to your room, one lift to take you from the street to the lobby and another from the lobby to your room. It's not a big deal but the first lift is very slow and after a while this became a little irritating. If you're looking for a great hotel room then the Novatel probably isnt for you, however if you are looking for a good base to stay at while you explore New York then I'd give the Novatel a look.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - excellent location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4734638", "Content": "I stayed here with my partner just recently; I found it to be a great hotel - we stayed on the 14th floor and had excellent views of Times Square; location wise it is hard to beat.

This was my fourth visit to New York but my first at this hotel and I regret not staying here before. Check in was swift (Desk located on 7th floor but a lift takes you there so wasnt a problem!) and the staff very welcoming. The room on arrival was a pleasant surprise for me as after reading previous comments I was a little concerned. However I found it to be clean, well equipped with a TV, Safe, and plenty of wardrobe space. It was also incredibly spacious with a little seating area by the window so you can look out over THE most amazing view - Times Square at night! The Bathroom was adequate and the maid came in every day with fresh towels and toiletries etc. Previous reviews I read commented about the noise and I can see their point. The walls are quite thin and I did have a slightly noisy neighbour, hovever I didnt lose sleep over it and I suppose it depends on the room your allocated. The hotel seemed incredibly quiet but I suppose for the time of year this was justified. Another down side was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room - us Brits cant survive without a cuppa in the morning - however a Starbucks situated right across the street put that right. One big piece of advice when staying in this hotel would be to avoid the Bar and Restaurant as the prices are extortionate and there are simply thousands of places to eat and drink, many within walking distance in Manhattan. (Roxys Diner in Times Sq is a must for a piece of New Yorks finest Cheescake). The onsight gift shop also sells the essentials but again its pricey and my advice would be to head for a Duane Reade instead. The hotel itself is ideally situated for all the 'touristy' things you will want to do in New York and is also close to a 'Big Red Sightseeing Bus Stop' which is a 48hr hop on hop off bus that travels up and down manhattan island stopping at all the major stops- I go on it every year and it is an absolute steal compared to the price of New York Cabs. You must also try the Night-time loop, which takes you over the manhattan bridge into brooklyn to view the island by night (wear warm clothes if you go in winter). The Empire State at sunset is also a must do. So in a nutshell, the Novotel Times Square gets my vote and I shall definately consider it on my next trip to NYC.

It was clean and comfortable. The beds were also clean and there were plenty of blankets/pillows. There was an in-room safe, hair dryer, soaps, shampoos and lotions all available in the room at no charge. The walls were thick enough that we never heard our neighbors, the windows kept out all the noise of times square. THe bathroom fan kept the steam down after hot showers (and there was plenty of hot water). The area was convenient to all subway lines and it was easy to walk to area attractions. It was very easy to catch cabs. There were a very good choice of bars and restaurants within a shoret walking distance. Why not a perfect score then? Checkout, CHeckin, Elevators & Hotel Entrance, and Luggage Storage! Checkin & CHeckout - a nightmare. They didn't lose our reservation or anything like that - it's literally the process they have that makes it horrible. THey have 4 stations in the lobby but no line to queue in. This means that everyone has to look over each of the 4 stations, pick the line they think is the smallest, or will move the fastest and line up behind each one. It was a fiasco. They should have a line to queue in and call the next person in order. At one point during my stay I came down to the lobby to go out and saw about 7 parties just standing around giving each other dirty looks as if they were all trying to butt in front of each other. Checkout was the same - they got all our information correct but it was a bad way to end a good trip. Elevators & Hotel Entrance: The entrance to this hotel is on 52nd, not Broadway. WHen you walk through the revolving door, the luggage check is in front of you and the elevators up to the actual hotel are to the right. THe problem is that the space is so small that if a couple parties arrive at the same time, you can't get in or out. The whole area fills up with people and luggage. And, there's only two elevators for the entire hotel. The hotel is actually on the upper floors of the building. You can't walk into the hotel from the street level - you are always stuck taking one of these two elevators up to the lobby, where you have to get out and get into some other elevators that then take you up to the floor rooms. This was really inconvenient. THere were no stairs - we asked and were told that all the stairwells were alarmed and that we couldn't use them. One other thing about the elevators - although there were only two to get everyone in and out of the hotel, there were 4 that run from the lobby to the floors where the guest rooms were. They were smart enough to realize that they needed 4 elevators to get people to and from their rooms, but didn't realize that 2 wasn't enough to get these same people out of the hotel. Luggage Storage - the men working did a great job but this little area of the entrace was always crowded and many times there was luggage just sitting around waiting to be taken to the back storage area. It's not that it sat there all day - they just had so many people coming and going and dropping off luggage and picking it up that they couldn't keep up. Overall it was okay, and for the right price, I would probably stay again.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cLocation is everything\u201d", "Author": "L8H", "ReviewID": "UR4335927", "Content": "I have just returned from New York where we celebrated the arrival of 2006! We stayed at the Novotel and although this wasnt the best hotel I have stayed at it certainly wasnt the worst. We booked this break quite late (end of Sept) and after getting a great deal on flights was shocked to say the least to find out the kind of prices hotels were charging for this busy time of year for New York. Novotel was recommended due to its location and view of the ball drop in Times Sq. As it happened it was one of the cheapest at $409 per night and after reading some reviews I think I may have had a good deal (next years prices are $699!!! Firstly this hotel is not worth $409 a night. However thats not to say it is a very good hotel with a fantastic location. It is located in Times Square and in the heart of Broadway with all the theatres. 5th Ave, Rockafellar, Radio City are all within easy walking distance too. The street entrance is a little offputting as it is basically a lift lobby. The reception is on the 7th floor and is very welcoming. All staff we came into contact with were friendly and helped us with whatever we needed. If I had to describe service it would be no frills. The check in was quick and we were allocated a room on 33rd floor with Times Sq view. Fixtures and fittings were not new or modern but were well kept. The rooms were a very nice size and were very clean. We didnt use bar, restaurant or concierge so cant comment. We did use the minibar once where a 75ml Evian water was $6, so a little pricey. It really is the location which gets this hotel my 4/5 rating and especially for a New Year holiday where you can experience the Times Sq atmosphere without having to queue for 10 hours. An unrelated point, we went to see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels at the Imperial Theatre with John Lithgow and I must say this was a fantasically funny and enjoyable show and would recommend it.

The Novotel was a terrific deal given it's location. It is a solid three star hotel that borders on four. Some things that detract from it, our heat/ac unit didn't function properly which didn't matter because it was a beautiful 70 degrees everyday but one and we never mentioned this problem to the staff because I wasn't about to give up our room and it's fantastic view! No high speed wireless connection, although I was told they will have it by spring next year. I made due piggybacking on connections that were extremely intermittent from the office tower we were facing :-) It is inconvenient to take the elevator from the ground to the seventh floor for check in. There are only two elevators for this and we were going to stop in at our room at one point and decided against it because there was a bus that was emptying it's passengers for check in and caused a major back up. My last gripe is simply that the rooms are dated and the king size bed was nothing to write home about. The Art Cafe that everyone refers to was not that impressive to me though, but that is not part of the hotel, they served me breakfast on a chipped plate which didn't impress me despite the reasonably priced breakfasts there :-) but this place is not operated by the hotel. All that aside, the good things at this hotel FAR outweigh the negative! The staff was tremendous! The view was magnificent and the desert in Cafe Nicole was superb. Our windows opened which is nice and they are soundproof windows that really work. It truly is amazing to see so much action going on down on the street and not hear it when you close your windows. Cafe Nicole, the bar and lobby area are generally calm and not all that busy, but the night we left there was a mob scene on the seventh floor in the lobby, the bar and Cafe Nicole due to the influx of people for the marathon. Really was a crazy sight when we left. We took our limo service away to the airport and left it all in the rearview mirror. Very cool, very New York. Location, location, location is ideal. We checked in at 2:30 and asked for a room high up overlooking Times Square. We were given a room on the 15th floor that had an awesome view of Times Square. The price is more than reasonable given it's location. Letterman is just up the street and we were lucky enough to see them outside of Ruperts Hello Deli filming some taxi, smashing stuff on the road which was very cool. This surprised me because Letterman was not taping that week. Overall this hotel is very pleasing to come back to after your long days of sightseeing. Here's a chaep and terrific dinner tip, I think the name was Chez Rendezvous. It was on 8th somewhere around 48th I will try to find the receipt to make sure the name and address are correct. I figured we should try to do dinner cheap at least one night of our stay and decided on pizza. This place was fantastic!!!! Here we received our cheapest drinks of the trip, and as my girlfriend mentioned also the largest serving of wine anywhere during this visit. The pizza was fantastic, the server was good. We had a small pizza that was perfect for two people, two tall drafts and a glass of wine. This was the deal of the year for me, $30 included a $5 plus tip!! Hell, I would have a hard time getting that price for that quality at home. This was such a find!! This is after being robbed at the chains near Times Square that were charging $13 for a tall draft. My brother lives in NY and told me to stay away from the Fridays and such around Times Square and look around restaurant row and on 8th and we would find some good food where the locals go. He took us to Joe Allens which had excellent food and a terrific ambience and was also reasonable. (Sorry locals, I probably wasn't supposed to give up this local hangout!) Anyway the Novotel was not my first choice, nor will it be next time, but it does make a perfect Plan B if my others are booked. I would highly recommend the Novotel NY. I need to make this clear, I would have no problem staying here again and this might just become plan A given it's price and location and staff.

Drawbacks: no high-speed internet access.

Also, I didn't see anywhere you could get a bottle or can of soda (except the high-priced minibar in your room), so soda machines would have been nice. The restaurant prices were also quite high, so I only ate there one night for dinner, which was good but not great. The location is great and it's easy to walk to just about anywhere you need to go. Try Stage Deli or Ruby Foos for some good meals, and there's an inexpensive diner around the corner from the hotel. I think it was the Art Cafe Diner.

First, and foremost, we couldn't have asked for a better location. We were just down the street or around the corner from the theaters. From our 14th floor window we could see a portion of Times Square. We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to see, or, at least, a subway station. Upon arrival, we were too early to check in; but the bell hops did an excellent job of getting us organized and watching over our bags while we spent our first hours in the city. We found it to be no problem having to take an elevator to the lobby. In fact, we met interesting people in the elevator! Being a French owned hotel, there were plenty of international folks which really added to the \"flavor\" of the hotel. The staff was helpful, courteous, and attentive. The lobby is bright and welcoming, and has a restaurant that literally overlooks Times Square. Our room was a decent-sized room with two double beds.

However spurred on by other members comments on this site, I went ahead and i got an excellent deal through UTELL website, $179 per night instead of $299 quoted on the hotels own web page. I was not disappointed, the hotel is a stones throw from all that Times Square has to offer, infact you can watch the goings on from the hotel veranda just through the bar area, its that close. An organisation called the Times Square Alliance has security guards patrolling the streets, very helpful when we asked for directions, so not just there for troublesome times. Anyway, more on the Novotel.....Slight drawback is the lifts/elevators, you need to take one lift from the street entrance to the reception area, then a short walk to another set of lifts which takes you to the hotel rooms. The room was pretty big for New York, 2 queen size beds, table, easy chair, TV, desk/unit, safe and plenty of storage space should you need it (we rarely unpack our luggage anyway!). Spotless bathroom, although the tub was a bit shallow, a pity as I like a long soak after a hard days sightseeing(minor fault though). We never dined in the hotel so can't comment on that but the bar was lively on an evening, can recommed the draught Sam Adams Ale, good service also with plenty of complimentary nibbles(just to make you more thirsty, I know!!).

The rooms were spacious for what I was expecting. They had everything you need. The air conditioning was a welcome relief from the hot/humid weather. It was temperature controlled so you didn't have to freeze or boil in the night. The housekeeping staff was extremely helpful. Booked $169 for 7 nights via Novotel website and it was a bargain. You could walk almost everywhere and the subway stop was less than two blocks away. No problems at check-in or check-out. With the great views of Times Square (for the cheap rate!) and the 9th floor I was worried about noise. Didn't need to be. I never heard anything from the street with the windows closed and even though our room had a connecting door I didn't hear a thing from neighboring rooms. My husband is quite sensitive to noise in hotel rooms and he didn't have a problem. Not many Americans staying there, though, mostly tour groups and airline crews. Didn't try the breakfast as over $9 for continental breakfast seemed a bit steep. Go to one of the many diners around the area and get a HUGE hot breakfast and coffee for under $8 each. Overall, it's great value for money and I'd stay there again. If you're looking for a romantic getaway, it's probably not for you, but as a base for a holiday in New York it was perfect.", "Date": "July 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cHospitality Not #1 at the Novotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2240868", "Content": "A colleague and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Novotel.

Based on other reviews on this site, I was expecting surly reception staff and smallish rooms. Instead the staff at reception was very efficient and fairly pleasant. The lobby was always busy and it often looked like the Paris airport with lots of flight crews from Air France. The room was bigger than I imagined, with room for the king bed, a sofa, desk, TV. And the bathroom had wood flooring, which is a great alternative to tile. The air conditioning was central (not window unit) and was relatively silent. I was lucky enough to get a room that looked out onto Times Square, and there is a terrasse/bar which has the same view.

Be forewarned, though, that the hotel is one of the oldest in NYC. It's obvious when you find out that all rooms are centrally controlled with no temperature gauges and the majority of the rooms DO NOT have AC controls. If you don't mind being in a hot, tiny, stuffy room, where the carpets on each floor smell like mildew, then this is the place to stay. The Reception desk on the main floor is also tiny, usually congested with line-ups of people (especially on Friday checkouts) and the ONE elevator (that holds a maximum of six people at a time) is completely unreliable. I ended up having to climb six very old flights of stairs on three out of my five days of stay. Although my room was comfortable and clean (after I ended up switching to a room with working AC), and the staff was as helpful as they could be, this is still a very OLD hotel - and that becomes quite obvious when you first see the hotel's front door entrance (you'd miss it if you really weren't paying attention). The lobby is also very drab (pale yellow) and could seriously use some artwork or color. If you're used to staying at the Marriott (like me) or other comparable hotels, spend the extra $100 and stay at a fully functional hotel. This one's great budget wise, but I'll probably never stay there again. On a positive note, there were no bed bugs! :-)", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGood value for repeat visitor\u201d", "Author": "eyeful11", "ReviewID": "UR125928919", "Content": "Got a good deal on one-night stay (live close enough to visit NYC frequently) from being on their mailing list.

I like hotels which take heed of comments and we even followed up ourselves prior to arrival. I requested a quiet room for us and our friends and we were delighted to receive just that. Nothing special in terms of a view, but I don't consider that important in NYC. The room had two queen sized beds and was very comfortable. It's a 3 star hotel and I would say that this was just about right, but the staff work hard and this was an important facet of our stay. Jenny on the reception was especially helpful and friendly. It wasn't not the biggest hotel room I've had, but better than others I've booked in Manhattan. The aircon was very noisy in our room, so we just used it to cool the room down in the morning, but that is the only real complaint I would make. It may be a bigger problem in the summer.

Located right by the subway entrance for the 1 line, getting there couldn't be easier. The Cosmopolitan is located just 5 minutes from Ground Zero and has the wonderful Century 21 Department Store on the doorstep. Staff were generally extrememly helpful and every request I made was received positively. I was even allowed to leave my luggage in storage whilst I flew to the West Coast for a few days - there was no charge for this service. Rooms, however, are very mixed in size and standards. I was initially allocated a room the size of a broom cupboard which wouldn't have been too had had there been a window that faced something other than a very close wall. I asked to be moved to a nicer room and my request was met politely and I was moved to room on the top floor, overlooking the street. What I wasn't told was that there were all night street repairs running and the windows were only single glazed and provided no sound barrier. At 23:00 I'd had enough and asked to be moved again. I was told there was nothing that could be done until tomorrow as there were no other rooms. I reluctantly accepted this, but by 00:00 the situation was intolerable. There was a differant person on reception (Marcin) and he had a much better attitude. He moved me to a room opposite, and that would have been fine had it not been flooded when I went in! Marcin then looked again and found me a suite on the 2nd floor which, although it again faced a wall, was large and spacious, and this compensated. I remained in the suite for the remainder of my 3 night stay. The room was clean and comfortable. It was also quiet and an effective cooling system and fan. I enjoyed my stay and would go back. However, it is clear that the first staff member (who appeared to be of management level) wasn't willing to take appropriate action in the early stages to resolve my issues. This could have been done, but wasn't. Only Marcin's timely and helpful intervention saved the day and ensured that the stay was pleasant and enjoyable.

I've stayed in many hotels in NYC, and Cosmopolitan ranks somewhere in the middle--it's certainly not the most luxurious, but it's certainly not the worst, either. Overall, it suited my needs and I'd stay again. LOCATION: The location is great. It's right in Tribeca, which was convenient to work meetings by the seaport/Wall Street area. It can be difficult to get a taxi right out front of the hotel, but there are subway stops for all the major lines within a block of the hotel. ROOMS: The rooms are really no-frills and quite small, but they are perfectly clean and comfortable. The room had plenty of space for a solo business traveler for two nights, but if you have more than one person, you'll want to upgrade. The room is a little outdated--an ancient television with basic channels, a tiny safe, and a window air conditioner that is very loud and blows right on your face. If you're traveling in extreme heat or cold, you may be uncomfortable, but it was fine for my mild November evenings. The bathroom looked recently renovated and had just enough space, but was actually larger than other NYC hotels I've stayed in. The shower is European-style, with a half wall. My coworker, however, said her bathroom was very different than mine, so you'll want to make sure you request an updated room. PRICE: I got a corporate rate through a travel agent, which made this hotel a good deal. The rack rates are actually pricey for what you get, though. But, if you can find a deal ($250 or under) then it's a great option if you're looking to save costs. If you don't need to save costs, then I'd suggest upgrading to the Tribeca Grand or another nearby, especially if you're traveling for pleasure. STAFF: The staff was very friendly and helpful, holding my luggage, getting me a taxi, etc. CONCERNS: I had a few concerns when I checked in. The room doors have old-school key locks with a little push-knob, like you'd find on a home bedroom or bathroom. As a solo female traveler, I felt a little nervous about this, but I had absolutely no problems. It's also pretty noisy, so if you plan to sleep in, you'll hear everyone in the halls in the morning. Overall, I was happy with the Cosmopolitan, given my need for an affordable room in a location in lower Manhattan. It wouldn't be my first choice for a leisure hotel, but if you can get a deal, it's a good bet for a seasoned NYC traveler.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kempton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Richard0337", "ReviewID": "UR121608189", "Content": "Very comfortable, pristine and pretty bathroom, great view of the Woolworth Building.

This may be Manhattan but for nearly $300 a night I expected much much more. Our room was on the 2nd floor. There are roadworks going on right outside the hotel, plus the traffic from West Broadway anyway. The hotel hasn't even bothered to put in double glazing, so it was incredibly noisy and sleep quality was poor. The room was hot - there's a ceiling fan for air con but it was too loud/cold to use overnight, so your choices are being hot or being cold. Rooms themselves were tiny - two double beds but barely any room to put your luggage or walk around. On our final morning we woke up to NO HOT WATER. So we had to check out without having had a shower for the day, not great. What made it worse was we called hotel reception four times and they didn't even pick up the phone. When we reported it in person the receptionist knew full well what the problem was seemed pretty sheepish about it - but she didn't bother apologising. One of the other reception staff offered us a free breakfast at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 next door (by the way don't bother paying $12.50 for that: terrible quality food and rude/unfriendly staff - the kind of people who stopped caring a long time ago and merely count the dollars in their pockets). I overheard numerous other people complaining about countless other things on checkout - I didn't hear anyone say \"this was a great place\" - and I got the impression hotel staff knew all the shortcomings but couldn't be bothered to address them. It's Manhattan after all, they can keep charging lots of money and getting away with it. Hotel staff were pretty useless whenever we asked for directions, advice on getting to the airport, local information. You know, the kind of stuff people who work on a hotel reception are meant to know. I don't know NY at all well and I couldn't have done a worse job than them. On departure they offered to call us a cab as we had heavy bags. After repeated assurances that they were working on it, 20 minutes later they said a cab wasn't going to happen and we should just get the subway. Massive waste of our time and really inconvenient, but I guess it was fitting that our departure lived up to the same standards as the rest of our stay at this hotel.

I WAS WRONG! The hotel is located in Tribeca and it was very close to all my meetings as well as all places I wanted to visit as it was my first time in NYC. There were a bunch of subway lines right outside the hotel door therefore travelling to midtown or uptown was an easy thing. There was also a starbucks downstairs, which if you're like me and you can't live without your coffee in the morning that is a big plus! I arrived at the cosmopolitan hotel at around 10AM. I was greeted by a bell man who took my one bag away from me and didn't let it go until I got to my room. Check in isn't until 3pm so I wasn't expecting to be able to check in but to my surprise the very nice lady Marcella told me that my room is ready and I can check in. That was great...a BIG PLUS for me! On top of my early check in I was also given an upgrade from a standard room to a king room. Excellent! The room itself is not a huge thrill but it is up to date and EXTREMELY clean! The amenities were limited but I had just what I needed to survive my week in New York. The only few things that I can complain about is the bit loud ac unit in the window and the lack of coffee makers in the room. Other than that it was all pure perfection! What really beat my expectations was the staff...I've stayed at many places where the hotel staff just doesn't give a s***. It was different here, the staff actually cared about me! From the moment I stepped in the hotel until I checked out a week later I was given the best customer service I could imagine. From whatever I needed whether it was extra towels or directions to my meetings the cosmopolitan hotel staff was always there and always willing and able to help me. I spoke to the morning staff many times throughout my stay (mainly Marcella) and the help I received was always just what I needed plus much more. Whenever I stepped out the front door I knew where I was going, what trains to take, where to buy tickets, etc. thanks to the help of the front desk staff. And on the last night when I realized I have no idea how to get to jfk airport I spoke with the front desk person Martin at 3am and he provided me with the different ways that I can go about getting to the airport. I requested a car service for 4:30am that same night and was reassured that the driver will be on time and waiting...and when I came downstairs the driver was there and ready to take my luggage. Wow!

The bed was supposed to be a double bed, but it was actually more a 1 persons bed, so unfortunately we did not have a very good night sleep, just because we were cramped into bed together. The elevator is really slow. On several occassions we waited approximately 15 minutes for the elevator to reach the floor we were at. We decided it was better to take the stairs, although we were staying at the 5th floor. The good things about this hotel is the price and the location. The location is really great: in the heart of Tribeca with a good subway connection to all major attractions. There are some really nice restaurants just 2 blocks away, so if you're not in the mood for taking a cab or the subway, you can always choose to go to a restaurant within walking distance of the hotel.

No garage name, no street address, no map nothing. In the end I had to pull over and call Hotels.com to get the hotel's number to get a specific address.

TRIBECA is a real mix of art, high culture, grittiness and sleeze. It is well downtown (TRIBECA means Triangle Below Canal) and is below SOHO, Greenwich Village and Gramercy Park. It is filled with every type of restaurant and bar; some very high class and some for those of us with an occassional taste for the lowlife. I would definitely recommend a visit to the Patriot Bar for a dose of great, loud country music and reasonable drinks served up by great women who sometimes dance on the bar and sometimes throw ice cubes at you. Again, you can clean yourself up(Especially if you find yourself with a person of taste at some point) and dine and drink and shop at whatever level of elegance suits you. This is a really varied scene. When you are not partying, walk 5 minutes over to the World Trade Center site for an immediate immersion into our most somber recent history.

My husband and myself stayed at the Cosmo March 17th-20th for a mini vacation. I have family who lives on the same street (Chambers) that this wonderful little hotel is on, so we decided to give it a whirl based on the proximity to my family and the price. Depending on what airport you are coming from their might be some different ways to get to this hotel, but they should all be very easy. My husband and I flew into JFk, took the air-train to Howard Beach station and then transferred to the A train which actually stops almost right next door to the Hotel which was VERY easy to find. The whole trip took about 45 minutes. The hotel is the longest running hotel in NYC, but don't let that scare you, because they take very good care of it. The hotel is small, so if you are traveling with a larger group of people, this hotel is not for you. Check-in was quick and friendly and in no time we were on our way to our room, which was a Mini-Loft on the third floor. The mini loft is a little secret that is perfect for a couple. The room was small but plenty big enough for the two of us, and it was probably the cleanest room I have ever been in. It was quiet and comfortable and just what we needed. The location of the hotel is prime. Their are several Train stations close by to travel anywhere in the city. There is a lot of road construction going on that my family stated will take about a year to complete, so if you are picky about that then this might be a kicker. We did not have any problem with noise. There are two little cafe's down stairs which are adorable and for the Pastry lover, a big hit! There is also a Starbucks right down-stairs. There are plenty of Restaurant options available near by. There is only one elevator in the building and it can take a few minutes to arrive sometimes, but the stair case is right next to it. So if you are a budget solo or couple traveler, looking for a cute, clean hotel in a great location, then this is it.

When I asked the front desk clerk if he could change my room, he said they were sold out but he would see what he could do. Within 5 minutes, I had a new, ready room to look at. And because it was smaller than what I had originally booked, and on the inside instead of the outside, he gave me a discount. And I still got the wonderful winter special breakfast!!! Choice of a yummy crepe, oatmeal with fruit or yogurt with fruit at the excellent cafe next door. I can't say enough nice things about how professionally and warmly the clerk handled this. He was good natured and accommodating, and the rate deduction (to what I felt were already affordable winter rates) seemed especially generous. He made an already loyal customer feel appreciated and accommodated-and that it happened on a weekend the hotel was sold out was especially great. I am a loyal customer and will be back. Note that the rooms are all extremely clean and very new; the hotel's prices are great because you don't pay for a restaurant or bar or other stuff.

We will i think be going back here in a few years, nxt year we're stopping at the empire which is a bit more flash, we got it as a great price though as a package, but to be honest i think i'd rather come back to the cosmo! One other thing we booked through hotel conxions after some great advice from some new york forum members, totally great experience with them, really painless! Thanks forum members you were great and got us a great hotel!

The room was quite big, the bathroom small but well laid out (which could do with hooks for clothes/wet towels - my only recommendation for improvement). Air conditioner was below the window in the wall and made a quiet and constant rather than variable noise which helped mask the sound of traffic. We stayed for seven nights & the room and bathroom were thoroughly cleaned every day. Bedlinen and towels were also changed. This is a 'budget' hotel in that extra facilities (room service, ice etc) aren't provided, but it is top class in terms of comfort. The desk staff were always friendly. Secure storage of our cases (with a claim check) was provided on our check-out day. I left an item in our room and didn't realise for four days.

We got 'loft style' room that is cute with bath room/sofa/tv downstair & bedroom upstair (yes with tv). The room was 'old style' with narrow window, a glimpse of what old NY feels like. The lift could be quite slow but hey we only @ second floor, so it was much faster just walked down the stairs. Hotel didn't offered b'fast, but who need it when there is a coffee shop next to hotel, that offered heavenly french toast/yogurt parfait. There are surrounding businesses: barber shop (m'darling hubby got his hair cut there), coffee shop next to hotel, that offered heavenly french toast/yogurt parfait, and 24 hrs mini market. There are ton's of eatery places @ Manhattan: Starbuck , Mexican restaurant, at the other corner, Italian, Burger style coffee shop u name it! very accessible, & bustling down town.

I checked in about 11:30pm and got to my room ( a loft). The a/c didn't work so I called the desk clerk, he said to turn on the switch on the wall and if it still didn't work to call back. It still didn't work so he said he'd send someone up. Nobody came so I decided to go down with my luggage and ask for another room. He seemed like he didn't want to move me, never apologized and tried to call maintenance a couple times, even though I asked for another room. The next day I left by 9am and got back about 3:30pm and despite the maid service sign being out my room wasn't cleaned. I called the front desk and the same rude desk clerk wanted to send up the maid then. I asked if they could come after 5:30pm and his only answer the maids leave at 5pm. When I asked again can they come after 530 he said ok, but when I asked why he said they leave at 5pm, he just said they leave at 5pm. I went downstairs to sit in the lobby and wait and after awhile I asked the rude woman at the desk if the maides were done, she said she'll call to send one up. When I threatened to look for another hotel - she said go ahead there is one across the street - not helpful, no apology nothing. Pros: free wifi, location - near multiple several subway lines. One right outside the door and another a block away. A few blocks away from the trade center site. Cons: Don't get a loft room - The loft has a double bed and tv - you cannot stand up straight, very hot up there and the bed was uncomfortable. I ended up sleeping on the pull out single bed from the chair because it was more comfortable and much cooler. On the lower level and luckily there was another tv down there. Noisy to the outside - window a/c so the soundproofing to the outside was horrible.

You can take your purchases into a very comfortable room along side the store and sit and eat. There were lots of locals in there so it did seem a popular spot with everyone.

I booked the hotel and was given a quote of $849 for my stay. However when I got there the Desk clerk (she had an accent and was red haired) Checked me In... This is were the problem started. She told me the room was $950. I pulled out the confirmation and the names of the guys, I spoke to three times confirming the price. I even called before I got on the plane and they confirmed the price was $849. She cut me off but told me she can lower it to $915. Here I am in a city I never been to by myself with no family. I had no choice but to take the room. I told her, I would hand this at check out when I had to pay. Solution : When I checked out, I spoke to the gentleman at the front desk. Told him what happened he apologized and he told me I only owed $829 . He stated he had no idea where the $915 or $950 came from. I didn't argue since he fixed the problem and gave me an additional discount for my trouble. I recommend the male Spanish desk clerks.. Stay away from the red head. Room : Clean but Small. I had the Bed with the sleeper sofa. Two people max for the small space. Shower was nice size and clean. The housekeepers were very diligent about the cleaning.. However, the window in my room fell out of the tracks when I closed the curtain.. Luckily I caught it.. and placed it back.. but all in all it was a good room and they kept the temp. setting warm and comfortable. Location : The location was great. The Subway was right next door. So you can take the 1,2or 3 train uptown. It was a good location. And Canal Street was very close. Great shopping. (Haggle at Canal Street at Night... give a sob story to the street merchants for a good discount. I told one my grandfather need a watch, he tried to sale it to me for $200 .. he gave it to me for $11 after I hit him with the puppy dog eyes..)

Before dinner, we were looking at our souveneirs, particularly the expensive one, and we set it out on the table. We then left our room (doors automatically lock), and we double checked. When we returned from dinner, the souveneir was gone. We searched the room high and low, and then went to report it to management. On our way there, we noticed many workers (maids, cleaning crew, both men & women) in our hallway. We approached the front desk, and asked the manager who had access to our rooms. He said everyone did, and we told him about the theft. He just stared back blankly and said \"well, file a police report\". I stared at him stunned. He didn't care at all!

The location was OK, downtown with not a lot going on but all the action is a quick cab ride away. We mostly took the subway and it's nice to have one right outside the Hotel. So, mostly it was a good experience. The only problem is the elevator. They only have ONE elevator and it's very slow. It often gets stuck when too many people are on it.

I'd agree that the hotel has quite competitive rates - we arrived about 6pm and were assigned a room on the 3rd floor. We went up to our room and initially I was quite shocked - it was small, had very dark furnishings, was roasting hot (the room had air conditioning but wasn't switched on for our arrival). Our \"view\" consisted of window facing a brick wall which added to the room having quite a \"dark\" feel about it. The bed was a little on the small size too - I'm 5'9 and my feet were almost sticking out of the bottom. The room was clean but we both agreed that the less time we spent in here the better so we only really changed clothes, showered and slept there. We did catch a glimpse of the inside of some other rooms and these were totally different, they were much lighter and better furnished and were bigger - they had twin beds so I would recommend booking one of these if possible. Location wise it's quite good and has a subway entrance directly outside, Ground Zero and Brooklyn Bridge/Wall Street are about 3 blocks away.

When we booked 3 months before hand I had requested a room as high up the building as possible (there are 7 floors). Unfortunately on arrival this request had been completely ignored and we were put in a room on the second floor (i.e. what English consider to be the first). I showed the receptionist a copy of their e-mail acknowledging our request and whilst she gave no explanation or apology did at least offer to try and give us a better option for the rest of the week.

We were on the Chambers Street side. The rooms on the West Broadway have better views although even then you are only looking over a street intersection and on the floor plan look about the same size only longer and narrower than ours. There are also some rooms which have no external outlook which I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy. There is a lot of construction work going on nearby at present including the refurbishment of one of the subway entrances immediately outside the hotel and an apartment/office block being built opposite.

Whilst some people may prefer to be further north in Midtown or the Theatre District we loved the location. We did the tourist bits all over the city using the subway (the 7-day Metrocard at 25 USD is fantastic value). We were able to walk to many of the downtown places of interest but best of all we were within easy stumbling distance of lots of local bars. Tried 20 odd during our stay and a couple of favourites were the ear Inn 326 Spring Street and The Tribeca Lounge on West Broadway. Also ate locally too. Lots of restaurants particularly along Greenwich Street and streets off. Spoilt for choice for breakfast with the Cosmopolitan Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (next to W Broadway hotel entrance), Soda shop (next to Chambers Street entrance) and The Kitchenette at 80 W Broadway. Highlight of the week (well I would have to say that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I) was proposing to my partner on Brooklyn Bridge at 0200 on the Sunday.

I was given a room on the 7th floor facing Chambers Street which the check in clerk assured me would be quiet. The room was clean but very small - the bathroom in particular was so small it was necessary to move around sideways, like a crab, and there was nowhere to put toiletries. Once in the room I noticed that a) there was a building site opposite and b) the curtains were cheap and thin. However it was a Sunday afternoon; there was no apparent work going on at the site and I assumed that any work would take place during the day when I'd be out at meetings. I went out with friends and returned to my room at approximately 10.30pm. I noticed then that there was noise coming from the building site. The noise comprised loud banging, men shouting, and trucks bringing materials to the site. The site was very brightly lit and the thin curtains in my room did nothing to keep out the light. I got ready for bed and tried to sleep. After about 30 mins trying various tactics to keep out the noise and the light (switching from the bed to the sofa bed, putting cotton wool in my ears) I phoned the front desk to ask if I could change rooms. The clerk to whom I spoke was extremely rude and unhelpful and told me there was nothing he could do for me until the next morning. Once again I tried to sleep but it was impossible. I had meetings the next day and needed to sleep. At about midnight I gave up and phoned to book a room at another hotel that I'd stayed at before that I knew would be quiet. I went downstairs and told the clerk that I was checking out because it was impossible to sleep. Again he was rude and surly - he spoke hardly a word to me during the check out process. I was taken aback that I was charged for the abortive night's stay but too weary to argue. On my return to the UK I contacted the hotel to complain about my experience. The hotel manager did apologise for my experience but did not offer to refund the cost of the first night. He suggested that the noise from the building site was caused by 'the city' doing emergency work in the street outside. Er, no it wasn't. I told a friend who'd stayed at the hotel a couple of months previously about my experience and he said the exact same thing had happened to him - and the noise from the building site had gone on all night. He'd stuck it out until the morning and been able to move to a much quieter room the next morning.

In our opinion the hotel accomodation and location were very good. Indeed, the staff were also very friendly and helpful too. We had a 2 double bed room over looking West Broadway. It was very clean and the decor good. The only negative was the heat. Despite being around 4-5 degrees centigrade outside, the room was hot. There was no air conditioning other than opening the window or the ceiling fan. These were relatively minor points as we found the location ideal for our short break. At present there is some road and building works in Chambers and West Broadway. This wasn't too much trouble other than one night when the road works started at about 10pm! There was a Starbucks downstairs, together with a Cafe and the Soda shop. Apart from Starbucks, we did not try the Cafe or Soda Shop as we tended to get up and out before they opened (7.30am). For Breakfast we went one block down to Greenwich Street to Gee Wizz. Excellent diner and very good value for breakfast. For dinner, there are a number of good restaurants very close by. However, we would recommend Deans in Greenwich Street (a 10 minute walk away). It serves principally pizza and pasta, but the setting was good and the service excellent. The hotel provides a book in every room with a good source of information, particularly restaurants in the area. Both of the above we found from this. To get out and about the subway station entrance is just outside the hotel on the corner of Chambers and West Broadway. If you already know New York Subway system then this entrance will only get you on the 1, 2 or 3 lines. One block up on Chambers St is the other Subway station (A, C, E lines). You could get to everywhere in New York from either of these stations in around 15 minutes. Far better than staying in Midtown, where it is very busy and noisy. If you plan to use the Subway alot we would recommend the 7 day Metrocard for $25. If you pay for each ride, then the fare will cost $2 per trip. so if you plan on making more than 12 trips on the Subway, the Metrocard will be cheaper. It can also be used on the Buses.

Curious things: The hotel is a bit old fashioned. First-they only give you one (1) real metal key. Thus it would be difficult to say go to a conference and bring ones spouse along. Who gets the key? Second the single elevator is aged, and rather particular on when it will work and at what speed. Don't stay here if you are unable to use stairs. Third- they didn't send or provide a written quote for the room rate. Thus when you check in and the rate is different then what was quoted, you have nothing to go back on.

Exit out of the Chambers Street entrance and turn left, at the end of the street on the corner is a nice deli which serves breakfast. Will stay here next time and the next aswell!

They told us someone would come and check, called twice and were ignored. We gave up. The room finally cooled down some at about 2:00 am.

The huge amounts of people visiting New York in Dec. made the taxi ride extra long to the Times Sqaure area. I have been there with alot of people before but never this many. It was hard to even get up close to the Rockefeller Center Ice Rink, just to see it, there were so many people. Go in the spring, much more enjoyable. I ate at Bubbys. Good Food, but be willing to pay. $15.95 for some pancakes and they squish you in so others are so close they can hear your conversation. There is a McDonalds around the corner not to far. The price was right for December compared to Times Square prices but if I went back I would stay at Hotel 41, good clean room, location in Times Square and reasonable rates as long as its not December rates. The View Lounge at the Marriott Marque (revolving) is my favorite place to go, the view is great and you can wear jeans up there. They have a buffet with heavy appetizers and desert and cheese bar. Get there around 5 to see the lights but there is a cover charge if you get there after 9, or if you are there later then 9. You will want to call about this but its more like a restaurant then a bar. There are little tables for 2 all around the window which makes it romantic. . I would not stay at this hotel for longer then a night. I made the reservation for a quite room and got street side. The price is right for December but location sucks to me compared to Times Square. Its about a 20-25 min walk to China Town. Please be prepared, the amount of people here in December has like tripled since I was just here last Memorial Weekend.

The Cosmopolitan is the exception to the rules, as even though it is a budget hotel it did not skimp on items such as toiletries and a few creature comforts and was spotlessly clean. However, it was the hotel's location that made it the best selling feature to us; being right in the heart of Tribeca it was walkable to some of Manhattan's most interesting neighbourhoods and right on Chambers St subway, which opens up the rest of Manhattan to you too (once you can fathom Express from Local trains!). You are right on West Broadway, so can have a 15-20 minute walk to Soho where you will find some excellent boutique shops and restaurants. Tribeca was gentrified several years ago and as the hotel does not provide breakfast, this is no hardship as the immediate area has some lovely restaurants and breakfast options on your doorstep, and a Starbucks right next door. I can recommend the friendly Cosmopolian cafe for a hearty breakfast fix, right next to the hotel. The rooms are a little on the small side, but for an extra few bucks you can upgrade to a room with a sofa that provides you with some extra space for those shopping bags. The bathrooms come with a bath (with shower) and are a little on the small side (but we didnt come all the way to NYC for a large bathroom!) but very clean.

The staff are helpful and know the neighbourhood well and were happy to book us a taxi back to JFK for our early departure, and point out bars to meet friends in and restaurant choices. The neighbourhhood always felt safe at night, as there were always people and traffic around, but i would advise that you take the usual necessary precautions anyway and leave your valuables in the lobby safe. The only downsides I could mention are the double beds are queen size, so they are a little cosy, and secondly this is a busy, bustling 24-hour city, so bring some earplugs if you are sensitive to noise. All in all the Cosmopolitan is a nice budget hotel in a great location, which I would happily return to.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mijas, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat Base!\u201d", "Author": "BoardmanMijas_Spain", "ReviewID": "UR10997951", "Content": "This hotel is just a great place to base yourself for a trip to New York.

The aircon in our room (and most rooms) was placed in the lower part of the window which lead to an awful street noice. Sure, it's the city that never sleeps, but it's not good when you feel like you're lying in bed right on the street.

For breakfast, try Kitchenette or Imperial Coffee. Kitchenette is a classic american restaurant, very cute in d\u00c3\u00a9cor and absolutely great food and service. Imperial is more suitable if you're in a hurry (quite hectic!), but no complaints neither on their food nor service. Great prices as well. For lunch or dinner, try out Burritoville. Doesn't look all that great when you're just looking in through the windows, but food is fantastic! Also Mary-Ann's just next door to the hotel and Mudville 9 are good places to eat. It's very easy to discover NYC from the hotel. Subway is just downstairs basically, and that takes you anywhere you want to go. By the express train you can reach midtown in ten minutes. You can reach downtown, Soho and Greenwich Village by walking. To sum it up: The hotel is good, the area is great!

The hotel has been refurbished in the past couple of years, and the decor is quite nice. When we were there, New York was on a bit of a heat wave 95f or so. Apart from the lower floor, and your room, the rest of the building is without any air-con, and feels very sticky & muggy. There is only one lift, and sometimes that means you've a fair time to wait, in addition it's quite small max 6 people. The rooms are of a nice standard & clean, though compact. We had a loft room; the bed is on a mezzanine level. The stairs up are very step, and means your approx 2-3 foot from the ceiling which obviously has some limitations, more so if you not good with confined spaces. The other issue is your closer to the upstairs bed, and one night is was a case of 'When Harry Met Sally', we did find it quite funny, and a short film if you know what I mean........ The only issue I had with the room was the air-con, instead of a centrally plumbed system, they have the all-in-one window box affair, that are pretty noisy and can affect trying to get to sleep/watch TV etc. These are minor gripes; the hotel is in a fantastic location, with Greenwich/Soho/Meat Packing District all with in a comfortable 15min walk. Directly outside the hotel is the Red Subway line, and a 100yds or so to the Blue line, so ideal for getting around. Times Square within 10mins on a Red No2. Underneath the hotel is a Starbucks, great for the morning Coffee. Next to the hotel is a good Mexican that gets v.busy, and a French restaurant that seems fine. A great bar opposite for beer, ribs and wings and other true American favourites. The best find is the grocery store directly opposite the hotel (where the clump of trees is) this I believe is open 24/7 made great deli sandwiches when we went there at 10pm Sunday night directly after we checked in, great selection of drinks, snacks, fruit and anything you need. Opposite this is a Pharmacy, so you really have most things catered for within 100 yds. Though you do need to explore.

We prefer staying in Lower Manhattan when we visit NYC--so this seemed a smart choice. The location was awesome, but the hotel was awful. The room was so small that we had to literally climb across the bed to get from one side of the room to the other. A few of the windows in our room were bricked up (and I think another one faced a brick wall). Needless to say, we felt clostrophobic the entire time we were in our room. Especiallly after we went shopping and barely had any room for our bags! At first we just laughed it off, but then I started thinking that if there would be a fire we'd never be able to get out. The elevator was old, rickety & only fit a few people at a time & afterall our windows were bricked and had bars on them. The overall appearance of the hotel is dingy and I felt like I was in a European Youth Hostel. Maybe we just had a bad room, but we did ask for queen or king sized bed--and we got a double. We both barely fit on the bed (I'm 5'ft 3 115 pds and my husband is 6 ft 190 pds). I don't even think there was much of a lobby. When we stayed there it seemed as if all the other guests were very young Europeans--who did in fact look like they were back-packing. Its one of those places where you don't really want to touch the comforter. In addition, the average ammenities that you're used to having in a decent hotel were missing. We didn't have cable in our room, a safe, or any bath products. The TV was very old, there was no parking; and the bed was hard--It seemed very old. Although the bathroom was somewhat clean, there were a bunch of hairs on our shower curtain--that didn't belong to us. When I took a shower I didn't want to touch anything. I probably would have had a better opinion of this hotel if I would have stayed here in my early 20's b/c price was more important over comfort. Now that I'm older (early 30's) I don't like to sacrifice comfort or safety in order to get a good deal. We now stay in the Millenium Hilton Hotel. Its 100% better than this place. The rooms are bigger, cleaner, brighter, they have safes, plasma TVs, good bath products, parking, etc.. And its really not that much more expensive.

We had a room with 2 double beds, which wasn't the largest (according to the floorplan on the back of the door) but plenty of room nonetheless. We booked direct with the hotel itself, so paid the full $199+taxes quoted on their website. I think we may have got it cheaper if we'd shopped around but I like the reassurance that they can't claim that they have no record of a booking through a 3rd party. We were on the 2nd floor facing into an air duct, so it was really quiet and we hardly had to use the lifts, but on the other hand very little daylight reached our window. Not too much of a problem in the winter when it gets dark early anyway, but difficult to work out what to wear in the morning if you can't see what the weather's doing. One of our 2 windows was bricked up, but covered with massive mirror, which was very useful for two girls getting ready to go out! Our taxi driver also didn't know the hotel, so make sure you know the address or have a map handy. The hotel booked us a car for the trip back to the airport, which was a bit more expensive ($58)than a yellow cab but arrived with plenty of time to spare. We did not roam far from the hotel in the evenings, trying out a local \"slice of pizza\" cafeteria, Mary Ann's Mexican restaurant nextdoor and Ecco, a very nice Italian around the corner on Chambers St. We also ate at Delphi, a Greek restaurant for Sunday Brunch. We did try the Soda Shop, as recommended by other reviewers, for breakfast and it was good.. and found Kitchenette on our last afternoon too. Location was good for walking to City Hall, Ground Zero, Brooklyn Bridge, Chinatown and Soho... Rockerfeller Centre, Times Square and Central Park were a bit of a trek but we managed all three on foot in our first day (catching subway back to hotel as we were tired out!).

I wasn't disappointed. I booked the cheapest I room I could find that would accomodate two people who both wanted a bed each. This was a room with a double bed and a fold out sofa bed. The welcome at the hotel was friendly and smoothe. This hotel has no frills, such as a bell boy whisking away your bags - which I prefer - thus no uncomfortable 'how much to tip?' dilemmas. Our room was on the 7th floor and was small but clean, the bathroom was quite big and had free toiletries and towels provided. There is also a hairdryer, bizarrely placed over the sink with the plug just above the tap - this seemed a little unsafe to me, however that is only because in the UK you don't even have a light switch inside the bathroom! The air con contraption was attached to the window - we switched it on once and the noise was deafening. This is the main problem with the room - it was boiling hot! There was a radiator that ran the length of the window in bathroom and bedroom, and although it was bitterly cold outside having the heating on all night is not good for you and tends to make you wake up hot, bothered and bunged up. There was no controls for the radiotor to adjust the heat setting. We did put the ceiling fan on which helped a little, but overall the room was simply too hot - we could have put the air con on, but the noise of that would have been far noisier than the constant traffic noise (why do they honk their horns so much, it's not like it makes any difference!?) and was no a practical solution. That is my only complaint really, and I am not marking the hotel down for this as the hotel is still great value, and for your money you probably couldn't find anywhere nicer. Location wise you wouldn't even need to leave the area in the evening if you were feeling tired or unadventurous. We ate in the Greek on the next block on West Broadway to the right of the hotel - not bad, then a Sothern Asian which was a block to the right and very vegan friendly and the food and service there was fab (forget the name of the place but you can't miss it, it's before you reach the Amish Market). On our last night we ate in the Mexican which is just under the hotel to the right - fantastic cocktails and food, slightly grumpy service. There is a great local bar a couple of blocks down near the South Asian called Brady's Bar - full of locals eating and drinking - friendly bar man and friendly locals of all ages. Great place to go if you want a drink but none of the uncertainty that might come of venturing somewhere unknown in the big city - the proprietor was really friendly and even gave us a free drink during the course of the evening. I did hunt down a couple of vegan restaurants during my stay in NYC - mostly on the East Side - Teany (Moby's cafe) 90 Rivington Street - best carrot cake in the world ever, Tien Garden 170 Allen Street, and the Candle Cafe on 7th Avenue. Anyway, back to the hotel - highly recommended. Also, there is a Starbucks, open late, right underneath so you never go without your coffee!

The location is fantastic - great for walking around in Tribeca, Greenwich, Soho and the financial district. Subway access is very handy. Tiny rooms, but still adequate for 2. No coffeepot, minibar or snacks in the room, but with Starbucks on the main floor and other delis, restaurants, and pubs nearby we didn't miss them. Very, very clean! Nicely decorated. Only negative was the noise from the street - ask for a higher floor or use the AC to drown out the noise. Also, the bathtubs are tiny - too small to soak in - so showers only. September was a fantastic time to visit - beautiful weather! Recommended sees/dos: a walk in Central Park one afternoon followed by a martini at Tavern on the Green, relax on a Circle Line boat tour up the East and Hudson Rivers, see Wicked the musical then Times Square at night, see The Daily Show with Jon Stewart taping weekdays, try Buddha Bar, Mesa Grill or Tribeca Grill for dinner, visit 30 Rockefeller Plaza, take in a museum: we loved the Guggenheim, and the shopping is just unbeatable!", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, Wales", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, but small rooms\u201d", "Author": "cardiffholidayer", "ReviewID": "UR6056578", "Content": "As others have said, our room was small with a tiny bathroom.

We chose to stay there because it was the only \"decent\" place I could find in NYC for under $200 ($165 per night to be exact). We stayed 2 nights, Sept 17 & 18. There is not one single extra ammenity provided. It is only a place to sleep. It is right on top of the subway, so you are just a few minutes away from everything you can think of. The location is great for the budget traveler. There was no deadbolt as previously described, but I never felt unsafe. And lets face it, if someone wants in your room they will just break the door down, so what good will a chain and deadbolt do anyway, get real. My only legit complaint was the street noise from outside. The walls are SUPER thin, and had we not been completely exhausted from running around NYC all day and night, I would not have been able to fall asleep. I think tripadvisor paints a fair picture of what to expect with the Cosmo. Extreme basics, but very clean. Please don't expect a fridge, or shampoo, or nice towels. If you do, you are lying to yourself. Just because you can stay at a 4-5 star hotel anywhere else in America for $165-200 a night, don't expect the same in NYC. Go with this in mind and you will not be disappointed. I'll give it a 3 out of 5 because it pretty much lived up to my expectations, but it is no where near 3 star quality.

The good points about it are: A} it's location. It is in an area where we felt reasonably safe and there were numerous diners nearby to get breakfast or lunch. B} The cleanliness of both the foyer and the room we stayed in. After that, there is no way we would stay there again. The rooms are small, cramped and claustrophobic. The double bedroom really is only for one person and even at that, one person would feel the walls closing in on them. I am 5ft 5ins and I constantly bumped my head off the ceiling in the area where the bed was placed. The double bed was 4ft 6ins. and not the usual size you get in American hotels and it was fitted right against the wall on either side.The bathroom is not even the size of a small en-suite. Whilst I realise that space in Manhattan is at a premium and hotel rooms are small anyhow, these were just plain ridiculous. They were stuffy and even with the air conditioning on (in mid October!) it was hard to get a breath of air. The corridors were 10 times worse. There was no small refrigerator whereby you could keep a bottle of water or a bottle of cola. There was also no kettle and cups so that you could make a cup of coffee in your room. However, by far the worst thing that I found wrong with the hotel, was the staff. They were arrogant, rude and downright unhelpful. They were so abrupt it was unbelieveable. I have traveled the world and stayed in many establishements and by far, these were the most unmannerly people I have ever met. Even if they didn't particularly like us, we were paying customers and deserved some respect.Instead of that, there were \"gangs\" of staff gathered around the reception desk the whole time and there were peals of laughter after you walked past. No matter what I requested, even help with the room phone, it was met with an argument. And I was not on my own. On two occasions, I passed reception to hear heated arguments going on.

It was our first time to New York City as part of an extended private tour of the northeast, and getting to the hotel was a task (the streets are nuts).

Then, one person must check in while the other is manuvering the car around the neighborhood to find long term parking. We checked in around 7pm. The desk was manned by latino americans, who spoke heavily accented english. I had requested a room with a loft and sofa, but what I got was not that. Don't be fooled by the pictures of the rooms you find on the internet, the room is probably 100 square feet, barely enough room for two small twin beds and not much else.

We had brought our own coffeemaker, just in case one any of the hotels we were staying in did not have one. We asked the bellhop, as he was unloading our car, if there was one- he said there was. Nope. However, after checking in and getting aclimated, the city turned out to be the best segment of our trip. The subway is literally in front of the hotel and goes anywhere you want to go on Manhattan Island and beyond, while being real safe to travel in (ever hear that old wives tale to never look another person in the eye while on the subway? nonsense; the riders were just like the people back home, normal people not nutbags). We saw all the usual attractions (Tip: take the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. It's free to ride), plus Greenwich Village ( a tad overpriced), the Stardust Diner (the wait staff sings with our dinner; fantastic), and North America's largest TGI Fridays (like a normal Fridays, but bigger, lol). Avoid the $40 price and one hour wait to the top of the Empire State Building, it's a jip. Later, we discovered you get the same level view from the Rockefeller Building for far less.

There are lots & lots of restaurants in that area, but they aren't as quaint or nice as the ones in Soho area. We did have breakfast each morning at their restaurant (\"The Soda Shop) next door around the corner and that was really great and not expensive. We took the ferry by the Statue of Liberty and went to Ellis Island which was amazing and very moving. We avoided the long, hot lines by buying our tickets the day before & getting there at 8am for the 1st ferry at 8:30/45. The walk from the hotel to the ferry location was long but gorgeous and I would highly recommend it if you have time.

It has handy small shops surrounding it and is about 5 mins from Ground Zero-if that interests you. I arrived late at night and the gentleman at the counter didn't have much to say. (If you are coming to the U.S for good customer service-stay home! The service here is terrible just about everywhere) The elevator was a little slow and quickly become busy.

The room was very clean though. The bathroom was tiny for a 6 foot 2 man like myself. All things considered, you have to remember thats this is very good value for this city.

(Note: If coming from LaGuardia, there is no easy way into the city. We tried a shuttle during rush hour but had to bail because of the traffic. Either a cab during off hours or the M60 bus to Astoria Blvd and then the N or W train into the city during rush hour are your best options.

Who says it is not possible to get a good quality hotel room in the city under $200 per night? We paid $168 per night (inc. taxes) for a double room = excellent value! - Clean and well kept. I cannot emphasise enough, the cleanliness of our room on arrival and subsequent daily maid service. - Although the bathroom was small (in line with expectations given the reviews on this site), the shower was hot and powerfull at all times. - Quiet! Our room faced an alley way, and we were not disturbed by noise at all during our stay. - The fan worked very well. Although it was not particularly hot whilst we were there, the fan worked so well we didn't need to turn on the aircon all night. - Convenience store next door. We were able to buy beers/water/crisps and a very tasty kebab at this store which is open until 3-4am every day. - Location. The hotel is located VERY near to a number of subways stations which are an excellent way to travel to Times Sq/Central Park and any number of other tourist attractions (We bought 7 day metro cards on our arrival and used them extensively - great value!) - Location again! The hotel is located very close to many \"real NY\" bars/restaurants (Edwards, Tribeca Tavern etc.) which we took advantage of. It was great to sit in a bar, soak up the atmosphere and not feel like everyone around us were tourists. Negatives - We were on the 6th floor. There is only one lift, which was pretty slow. - My partner thought that the bed was uneven and heavily worn. I didn't notice....after all day walking round I was out like a light!

I love the title of another review, \"does what it says on the tin\" because that exemplifies the Cosmopolitan. I was travelling with a girlfriend who is a mega germaphobe (she actually brings her own Clorox Wipes with bleach) so you can see what sort of standard I was hoping to achieve with this booking. Well, to my delight, when she wiped down the remote, the telephone, the bathroom surfaces and the light switches her wipe came away with almost no grime. At the front desk they had mentioned that cleanliness was there specialty and, in this case, I wholeheartedly agree. We had booked a loft room (room 207) through Hotel Conxions for $119/night and even though it was tiny, it easily suited our needs. A couple of caveats: if you are taller than 5'4\" you will not be able to stand upright in the loft area; I thought the steps up to the loft were fine but others might feel them to be a bit steep (I am 35, fit but not athletic); the pullout bed on the main level is literally 24\" wide (I measure because this is where I slept); no natural light though the large window and the bathroom is truly compact. Plenty of drawer space, some hanging, shower had good water pressure and room was always made up with fresh towels and toiletries. The room was like living on a ship - everything had a function and no luxuries. There is no iron, ironing board, full length mirror - there is a hairdryer. Front desk was always helpful and brought us up warm towels each night when we would get in, realize we needed more than one towel per person and then call down to request. We always used the stairs as it was much faster than waiting for the elevator and the clientele is definitely \"cosmpolitan\" with overseas travellers outnumbering the American travellers. Upon checking out the maid service let us peek into a freshly made up room with a double bed and it looked really nice, faced over West Broadway also on the second floor. I travel to NYC a lot and loved being in this area of Tribeca. Would definitely recommend the Odeon just a couple of blocks north for luscious desserts and Bouley Bakery Market just one block north on the opposite side of the street. At the bakery you can get amazing pastries and cappucino then take them upstairs to enjoy surrounded by windows on three sides. There is outdoor seating in the summer for lunch as well. This is my favorite coffee spot in the city currently, can you tell? Pricey, but posh. If you're in a hurry you can grab a coffee at Starbucks located in the ground floor of the Cosmopolitan. The subway is located just outside the hotel (Chambers Street station) with links to the 1, 2, 3 and A, R lines - well suited for travelling up to the Upper West Side, Port Authority or Penn Station. My friend and I were happy walking from the hotel to SoHo and the Lower East Side but that might be too much in some people's opinions, just depends on how you like to get around in the city. I prefer foot if I have the time because it's an awesome way to \"see\" the city - warts and all.

First of all the area. We loved Tribeca. Our NY friends told us it's a cool area but in a low key kind of way, interesting creative people choose to live there! It's got a good atmosphere and is totally different from the sterile atmosphere of uptown Manhattan. Transport links are great, there are 2 or 3 different subway links all within easy walking distance of the hotel. All on your doorstep is Starbucks, a general convenience store which is handy for bottles of water for your rooom etc and a great juice bar called Elixir. There is a great health food store around the corner too. Jamba Juice (another juice bar) is across the way as is a really cute liitle place to go for breakfast /lunch called Kitchenette. Other food places close by are Bread Tribeca (not dead cheap but plates pasta etc. for $16 or so, very tasty), Dekk (great Cobb salad and steaks). Down towards the Hudson river and closer to town is Bubby's which we didn't make but were told by locals is great for brunch. We walked into Soho from the hotel which was about a 30 minute walk but lots of interesting buildings and shops to look at en route. Soho is fantastic, great shops etc. Century 21 (huge discount store) is in the opposite direction towards the financial district and is well worth a visit but be prepared to rummage and get there early as it gets quite busy from 12 onwards. Hotel itself is totally fine. Our room was on the 4th floor. It had a double bed and white gloss bedroom furniture which was actually quite nice! There was a crap view but that was kind of expected. Air con units are noisy but we turned it off at night and just used the fan. Bathroom fine, white and clean. The rooms are very clean which is the most important thing. It wasn't big but not claustrophobia- inducing either. There are no mini bars or breakfast or anything like that but there are lots of good places to explore for food and drink close by that it's not a problem. (Be prepared for the generous servings!)

The room was clean, the bed was ok, the bath was narrow but still ok. The room service did a good job and the staff was friendly and helpful. (Do not expect that they do know everything about art galleries or Broadway shows) Close to the hotel is the subway station, red line 1;2;3;9.

The area around the hotel is not that exciting but nice and there are a few restaurants and bars close by. Directly beside the main entrance of the hotel there is a small shop where you can get sweets and drinks, at the corner of the hotel there is a Starbucks for your coffee needs. Right beside the Hotel is a Mexican Restaurant which is good (try the hanger steak with roasted garlic and mashed potatoes). We tried the Petite Abeille restaurant, 134 W Broadway, btwn Duane & Thomas St, just about 5 minutes away from the hotel, for breakfast.

The Cosmo is the only hotel (apart from a couple of high-end hotels facing the WTC site) in Tribeca, which is a little bit further away from all the action in Midtown. There are plenty of restaurants and foodstores servicing the local neighbourhood so food and supplies were of very good standard, I didn't find a laundromat locally so went up to Chelsea which wasn't too far. Tribeca gets described as 'gritty' which is accurate, it isn't plush like the Upper East Side, but it certainly wasn't dangerous either, playgrounds and schools are close so it dosen't feel 'touristy' when you step outside the hotel, but neither does it feel dangerous - I wanted a 'real' experience of NY and this was just that. It is noisy. On the street front its traffic, at the back airconditioning units turned on and off night and day (it was hot the whole time). I was at the back of the hotel which faces onto peoples apartments so if its good enough for the locals it was good enough for me :) Buy earplugs. The airconditioning and ceiling fan made the room very comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and housekeeping was of good standard. I noted that the rooms had panel heaters for winter. The big bonus is the subway. The 1,2 and 3 (Red) lines pass straight underneath the hotel which allows access right up the western side of Manhattan. Within 5 minutes walk is also the Blue and Green lines, allowing access straight into Midtown and the Upper East Side (Museum Mile) this is pretty rare, as Manhattan widens out people don't have the choice of picking which line to use - definately recommend using this hotel if you want to make the most of the subway system (catch a train to the first stop in Brooklyn, walk back across the bridge and you can be back at the hotel within 45 minutes). The downside? I think everyone who has stayed there would recognise my frustration that it only had one elevator, which the housekeeping staff made the most of in the mornings. The wait could take ages. Using a shuttle service can takes ages as everyone else will be closer than you will be, so it can be a long wait. TV reception a little hazy. Corridors are airless and can smell like smoke. It took a while to adjust to the NY attitude (abrupt, but don't take it personally) I ordered a car via the front desk to take me to the airport, the vehicle that arrived had seen better days - book transport yourself. New York might be famous for a lot of things but service is not one of them. In fact I'd say that if you judge a place by customer service you shouldn't be coming to New York at all! That said I liked the staff in the Starbucks downstairs, and the convenience store next door. Pearls of Wisdom? The station underneath the hotel is one of the major stops, the express trains always stop at Chambers Street so you can make use of express and local trains. Century 21 department store is a must, and check out the World Financial Centre Windergarden - there are also places to eat and a multiplex too. Internet access available in the Amish foodmarket a short walk away, get to the Statue of Liberty ticket office early for admission into the museum in the base, or all you will be doing is walking around the outside of the statue itself.", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a first time visitor\u201d", "Author": "jasmine1", "ReviewID": "UR3913543", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for our first time visit to NYC.

I've heard a lot of bad reviews about the staff, but we didn't have any complaints. They weren't overly friendly, but they were polite and professional. Our miniloft room--the cheapest room they offer at $129 a night--was small, but unique. We were in Room 310. Downstairs was a built-in shelf system with a TV, and a big chair (which we realized was a pull-out single bed). The bathroom was small, but clean, a big plus. There's a steep staircase going up to the loft with a double bed and another TV. As others have cautioned, it was a bit tricky to go up and down the stairs, and I'm only 24! The air conditioning worked great and there was a huge two-story window looking out on Chambers Street. It got pretty noisy with all those crazy New Yorkers out and about at all hours honking their horns, but it definitely gave us a taste of the city. :) The location was great! The first day we walked a few blocks to Ground Zero and the rest of the Financial District. We used the Subway a lot--the 1, 2 & 3 Red lines were directly outside of the hotel, which went to Times Square, Central Park and a ton of other places.

The floor had been mopped. I bring my own disinfectant so I did use that on the toilet and shower stall. (no bathtube).

The rooms are very clean and well looked after and although not huge perfectly adequate for both of us. The bathroom had a very small bath so it is better to have showers. We had a room at the back of the hotel. When we opened the window we were really disappointed to see a small derelict space and a big wall on the other side of it. The room was very dark and certainly did not give us any feel for New York. We asked for an alternative room with a view on the street - to the staff credit they looked at the issue professionnally but there was only one other room on the 7th floor. We declined because although light, it was absolutely tiny. The other main problem with the room was the noise coming from the generators outside. It was very difficult to sleep even with all windows closed, thankfully I had earplugs but my wife did not and had a few bad nights. I recommend leaving the fan and the central heating on all day when going out as it is otherwise very hot. The room was otherwise fine and comfortable enough. The other main problem we had was with the staff at reception about a misunderstanding over traveller cheques. We had Sterling to exchange and asked the guy at reception for a bank that would change it. We clearly specified that they were STERLING. He said the hotel did change traveller cheques. However he gave us 100 dollars instead of the 100 pound equivalent and when we pointed to him the mistake he said they only changed DOLLARS travellers cheques!!! It was too late for us as my wife had already signed them. We lost about 90 minutes trying to solve the problem in banks (we came across a couple of incompetent clerks on the way), in vain. This was very annoying because the hotel did not apologize for their mistake and hardly felt sorry. Otherwise the staff were OK, professional and polite although pretty impersonal, but I guess this is a standard thing in New York. The best thing about the hotel is its location, 10 metres from the subway and walking distance to Soho and World Trade Centre. So to summarise our stay would have been perfect with a room over the road and if we had had dollars travellers cheques.

Be sure to confirm reservations, and be sure to arrive at a reasonable time, as I have had trouble with them giving away my reservation. They did find me another room when I politely insisted. But your stay can be ruined by a bad staff person. Some desk people are very nice, others are downright surly and rude. Play it safe and arrive with enough time not to get the last room...

The double rooms (two double beds) are worth the extra dough, unless you're travelling alone. The subway (featuring the 1, 2, 3, and 9 lines and also the A and the E very close) is literally right outside the door, and the neighborhood features a lot of great restaurants and shopping.

As others have said there is a subway right outside and it's within walking distance of the WTC, Wall Street and Soho, little italy and china town. I would recommend the hotel but personally would not go back as I prefer to be out of the hustle and bustle a bit in the evenings and I prefered the Hotel Newton which was Upper Manhatten - there was nothing wrong at all with this hotel tho. Finally I would recommend if you fly into JFK getting the Air Train to Howard Beach for $5 and then getting a Metro card (7 days $22 - best value if staying 4+ nights) get the A Train to Chambers - the hotel is just down the block.

Secondly, the front desk clerk was able to check us into a room at SEVEN IN THE MORNING. Our room was ready and although check in is not until 11 AM, he was kind enough to give us the keys. We had taken a red eye from Phoenix and were grateful for this. The room was immaculate. It was amazingly large and well worth $145 a night (special Winter discounted rate booked at cosmohotel.com). There were two chairs, a love seat, an armoire with 2 drawers, and a desk in addition to the 19 inch (or larger) television. The bathroom was a decent size for an NYC hotel-enough room to open the door all the way while standing at the sink or the toilet. I am a frequent visitor to the city but have never stayed in TriBeCa. The staff at the front desk was very helpful with pointing us in the right direction regarding which trains to take, etc. There is a Q, R, N (yellow line) station right outside of the hotel entry and the A,C,E (blue line) station is just around the corner-you can navigate the entire city with less than a blocks walk!

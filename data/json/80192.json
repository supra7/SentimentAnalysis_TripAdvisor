Unfortunately, we had numerous problems with the Howard Johnson Express located at Hotel Circle in San Diego, and I had to contact the Corporate Office to get some resolution. We booked our hotel through Delta Airlines and prepaid $776.82 for our stay from July 21 through July 27, 2011. (6Nights) We booked a king non-smoking room . We always thought that Howard Johnson's was an upper middle class hotel chain. There were some restrictions that included; the reservation were non-refundable and no refunds would not be available for an early check out. When we arrived, we were assigned a smoking room. This was on the ground's lowest level and which appeared to be the most traveled traffic area. When we entered, the room was dark and smelly. The bedspread had burn holes in it. I went back and told the attendants that this would not be sufficient. We were then told the computer said we wanted a smoking room. I showed the attendant the information Delta had supplied us. We were then given another room on the highest floor, which was non-smoking but only had a queen size bed. We used the facilities and found that the toilet was plugged up and would drain quite slowly. We called the front desk and told them that it appeared that someone would need to bring up a plunger to fix the problem. A few minutes later, a man came up, but did not have the plumber's helper. He did get it to flush, and left. Approximately 3:30 AM we were awoken when someone was trying to use a room card to enter our unit. After repeated attempts to tell these persons that they had the wrong room and upsetting my wife, they finally left. About 15 minutes later, trying to get back to sleep, the telephone rang and it was the front desk employee. This person rudely said, \"What are you doing in this room?\" I was taken back and simply said that this was given to us. I could not figure out why this employee would even call, but I guess things like this happen? The following day we came back to the room but our room key would not work properly. Had to go up and down the four flights of stairs again to get new keys. Oh by the way, the motel advertises Hooters on the room keys... (classy place eh!?) I did have the opportunity to talk to the attendant who called us at 3:45 AM the prior night and told him that \"that\" was just wrong! The next time we had a problem, the toilet was not working properly. I called the front desk and explained that this had occurred in the past and that someone would need to bring a plunger this time. Now, I was told that I needed to come on down, get the plunger, and fix it myself!!. Up and down another, four flights. Lucky for me, I knew what end to use! This was getting a bit ridiculous at this time, so I asked if I could speak with the manager to explain our stay up to this point. I was told that Amy was the person who handles the complaints and she would be in at 9:30 in the morning, The next day, I did not have a chance to visit Amy since she was not there or had left for the day. Went back up to the room and, you guessed it, the room key did not work. We were given two sets of keys (two each) and neither set was working. Up and down again! The next night, the room key failed again! Up-down. Next day was told that Amy was not going to be there until Monday. Wow.----- All of these things happened between Thursday and Sunday! Finally, on Monday morning I had a chance to talk with Amy. I explained all of the problems we were having and the semi lame excuses that the staff was providing us. Amy was cordial, but again tried to explain and minimize the situation. She offered a $50 credit on my bill, which I refused. This hotel does not belong in the Howard Johnson family!! There is a problem with the sanitation system; the entry door is not fitted properly in the jamb; the showerhead is too low and did not work properly; there are cracked tiles in the bathroom; the TV reception was snowy: the couch had stains throughout; cobwebs and insects cover the exterior eaves and there was just plain filth throughout the establishment. This, in my opinion, is caused by a general lack of upkeep and failure to simply comply with standard industry practices. If you do stay here....DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN!! We paid over $770 for this stay, but would probably have been better off staying at the downtown mission! I asked about just checking out and finding another motel. Then I was told that since I prepaid, the chain could not refund anything. The unprofessionalism and unsanitary conditions at this hotel are appalling. I have asked Wyndham (Corporate Office) to follow thru with a thorough investigation in this matter; I did take pictures of the conditions. After about 3 weeks, the hotel refunded us only $115. The Corporate Office also contributed one night's refund.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, California", "Title": "\u201cNasty!\u201d", "Author": "mperaji", "ReviewID": "UR115295974", "Content": "The hotel has the necessities but dont come with high expectations.

Although I am not sure where the free breakfast was, which was advertised on the big neon sign outside. The room and bathroom were reasonably clean etc etc, despite the rather noisy freeway view. It was just the lack of decent hotel standards and the seriously bad attitude of the staff who worked there which shocked both myself and my colleague. The first night, I stayed on the fold out coach in my colleague's room. You would think that, being a hotel, they would have perhaps, a few extra pillows and a few sheets. No. 'We're out of pillows,' the woman behind the desk said rudely. I was given one poor quality blanket and the last sheet. So far so bad. The next night was worse. During the day, the cleaner had taken all my bedding and folded the couch back up, so we had to call down for more sheets, blankets and maybe that all-elusive pillow. It was about ten o'clock at night. 'I'm really sorry about that madam. I'll send a sheet, pillow and blanket up to your room in ten minutes,' said the voice at the end of the phone. More than 20 minutes pass. No bedding. So I call reception and speak to another man who tells me 'no room service past ten o'clock'. Of course, I explained to him that the cleaner had caused us inconvenience, that his colleague had promised to send up the bedding. Mid explanation, the man hung up on me. So, fairly irritated, I went down the five flights of stairs (didn't want to risk the creaky elevator) only to interrupt another complaint by a lady and her husband. She was, quite reasonably, asking for a new sheet for her bed as it was dirty. She also needed some extra pillows for her kids' bed. 'We have no more sheets,' the man behind the desk said, rudely. 'We have no pillows.' He handed me, what turned out to be the last sheet, while the perplexed lady quite rightly asked him what the hell was going on. This was a hotel wasn't it? Didn't they have extra bedding? Most hotels would give you more than you need. She pointed out she'd spent $170 for the room. Deskman started getting angry. 'I didn't charge you for the extra bed in your room. You can go somewhere else if you don't like it.' By now it was midnight. The woman was speechless and began to protest. 'I think I have every right to complain if the hotel room is dirty, I've stayed at other budget hotels and...' Deskman then lost it. 'I am not renting out room to you. You make trouble. You leave.' 'But my two kids have moved in,' the woman said, flabbergasted. 'We can't leave now.' The pair then proceeded to have a mini tug of war over the blanket and sheet on the desk. I advised her to complain about this in the morning for fear of the poor woman being chucked out of her room with two kids in the early hours with nowhere to go. The standard of service in this place was shocking. The staff did not appear to give a damn about their paying guests.

In a 3rd e-mail it was written the office would settle for 50%, as the hotel did <no one mentioned that to me>, but since I wasn't satisfied I'd have to deal with the Hotel. I called again: the GM told me they'd done all they'd do. *I feel Howard Johnson should compensate me for the remaining $92 of $132 charges they caused*. I'm most disappointed w/HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL, booked by a travel agency who won't recommend them again. They don't care about what they did... I don't recommend this place to anyone. but IF you stay watch your accounts", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, CA", "Title": "\u201cMight as well charge by the hour...\u201d", "Author": "jeniroli28", "ReviewID": "UR5923391", "Content": "I had never stayed in a Howard Johnson before, let alone a Howard Johnson Express. I got the chance last week when I was sent down for training. Training was to be held in the Doubletree thats just a few doors down (walking distance easy). My first reaction upon finding the \"hotel\" was, \"Are you serious?\" As I entered the \"lobby\", I was greeted by a life-size statue of Hulk Hogan... very classy I thought to myself. Checked in fine and as I make my way up the elevator and around the catwalk that wraps around the building 4 stories up, (sorry, scared of heights) I began to hope that my room would make up for what the \"hotel\" lacked in curb appeal. My hopes were crushed as I opened the door and the smell of smoke filled my nose and my eyes adjusted to the dark cave-like room. The room was small, very small, the bed was only a full (maybe a booking issue with personnel) and the lock on the door had to be jimmied in order to actually lock. What do you expect for $59 per night? Although, in all fairness to the \"hotel\", They did have a small fridge and a microwave in the room.

The room was tiny, and while it seemed acceptably clean, things were old. The faucet for the sink was loose, and the room was not well insulated from outside and highway noise.

However, the access was spotty, sometimes going out for a few minutes.

First, and worst, the room smelled like urine. It did not reak, exactly, but it was a strong enough smell that I could not put it out of my mind. It made the stay unpleasant, as you can imagine. Second, the ancient coffee pot in the room did not work. I asked if they could replace it or swap me one from a different room. I was told that there were no other coffee pots available. They also told me they did not have any ceramic/glass mugs, when I asked, in order to heat water in the microwave. (The alternative was to heat the water in styrofoam cups in the microwave). Since I got such a bad response on the coffee pot problem, I did not even try to get a different room with a better smell. Also, a minor point, breakfast was lousy, although that is not a big deal, given the price of the room. But for these problems, the price and in-room fridge and microwave would have made the deal okay. The furnishings and cleanliness were not otherwise terrible for a budget place. By the way, don't stay on Hotel Circle if you plan beach time. It was a good location for visiting the University of San Diego, but I don't know what else. There is a lot of traffic noise, although the air conditioner will drown that out for the most part. Any lure of an outdoor pool on this road should be ignored, since it is no fun playing in the pool with loud traffic noises very nearby.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot the best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2882832", "Content": "Stayed @ this motel Dec 6 & 7, 2004.

The hotel was a bit hard to find as Hotel Circle is a complicated setup. Once we found the hotel, we could easily navigate back to it. Our room was on the second floor near the elevator. It was very spacious and clean. A refrigerator, microwave and safe in the room were all available to us. The air conditioner was loud for me, making sleeping difficult, but not for the other 3 members of my family. There was little space to put toiletries in the bathroom and little space to hang towels. The pool and hot tub are small yet very enjoyable for my 2 children. The continental breakfast provided daily was great! Several choices of bulk cereal (no little boxes here!), juices, milk, canned fruit, coffee and pastries (not the freshest, though) The breakfast is available in a large room with plenty of seating and a TV to watch the morning news. A USA Today is available free in the lobby each morning. There are machines near the elevator that sell snacks and bottled water. Outlet plus were lacking (as they were in each of the 4 hotels we stayed at during our California trip) so I would recommend bringing a power strip if you have things you want to charge.

There was a room safe (a real plus) with a $1/night automatic charge, a coffee maker, small microwave and refrigerator. The continental breakfast was fair, with coffee/tea, orange juice, cereal and doughnuts, muffins and toast. A USA Today was free.

The location is very good--there is easy access to I-5 and it is just about 1-2 miles north of Old Town (easy to get to by going west on Hotel Circle South, which becomes Taylor St, going right by Old Town. San Diego is a fairly easy city to navigate and you can just about anywhere around the city quickly from this location. While this is certainly not a 4 star hotel, it provided what we needed.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quiet Thanksgiving vacation Drove by Hotel before turning around and finding entrance. Look for a low level dark green sign amid bushes on the east (left) side of the road just behind the Shopping center on Ray Road. Drive down a pretty but rather long drive back to the hotel. If you see the Alaska Airlines office park, you've gone to far.I got there early, got right in. The staff was less than exciting, but functional. the hallway carpets dirty, but the room fresh and clean. For a place next to the freeway it is really quiet. Bed in good condition, kitchen well stocked, my view not so great.I walked to meals. A large cineplex with dining across the street. A lot of shopping and other places nearby. A large park on 50th just north of Ray behind JCPenny gave me a place to walk my 5 miles each day. Great location, good place, ok staff. I'd stay here again. Especially at $29 a night.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819722299", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SenseIntoDollars"}, {"Content": "Poor service Poor value I made a reservation for East Chandler location thru 800 number and called to confirm the day before we left. When we arrived they did not have our reservation. Turns out they had booked us into another location without telling us because this one was booked. Since it was only 1 mile away we said fine. At the Chandler location (off Ray Rd) they checked us into a smoking room although we had reserved a non-smoking room. When we said that was not acceptable the manger Jason Dean repeatedly quoted \u9225\u6e03ompany policy\u9225?that they do not guarantee non-smoking reservations \u9225?they take them only as preferences. Jason said they had no non-smoking rooms available and we could take the smoking room or leave. After much discussion Jason reluctantly called and found us a non-smoking at another location 10 miles in the wrong direction. We had no real choice but to take it meaning we drove 20 miles out of our way.Room is just a basic motel room with a small kitchenette squeezed in the corner. They charge extra for internet access, coffee for the coffee maker, dishwashing soap, shampoo. The place is much smaller, with less amenities then other long term stay places we have stayed. Overall a very poor value.", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR728654315", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Travelez1234"}, {"Content": "An average hotel with decent location I stayed from 10/23-10/29. This was a hotel I recieved with by bidding though priceline.com, and really wasnt sure what to expect when I arrived. Although the hotel website says that check in is at 3pm, I arrived early into phoenix (9 am) and was at the hotel by 10am thinking I would have 5 hours to burn before I could check in, but there was no problems, questions, extra charges or nothing and they put me in early!!so far, so good right? Well....Upon arriving in my room, there was something not right. Handle on one of the kitchen cabnits was broken. Bathroom counter was not clean. One of the bedsheets had ciggerate burns and hair on it, and to top it all off, when I went to make coffee, old grounds were never removed and moldy!! YUCK!!!!I called up the hotel manager (Damen) and he came up to the room and checked it all out and he even agreed that is was not cleaned and unnaceptable. He promptly moved me to another room (which was very clean) and gave me a voucher for a free night at any ESA location.After being moved to another room, all was well. But honestly, dont expect high quality from this hotel. The bed is not the most comfortable, TV is kinda small and the view out your window isnt really that good, and housekeeping does not come unless you request them, and there is a fee ($5-10, i believer) ....but the one thing this hotel has going for them is location. They are very close (less then 5 min) away from the I-10, which takes you anywhere you need to get to in the phoenix area. They have the kitchen, which has cups, pots, pans, silverware, plates, toaster, microwave, fridge etc etc etc which was nice to have being there for a week. Had more then one desk/table in my room, and plenty of lights. The staff was very nice and friendly, no problems with them whatsoever. I paid $5 to have wireless internet for the week. Movie theather, stores, shopping, bars, restraunts all a 5 min drive from this hotel, and the area really isnt that bad.....didnt see shady people hanging around in the parking lot or have any problems with noise or even worried about my car one bit, the area is fine.All-in-all, I was happy with what I got for the amount I paid. Dont expect a luxury hotel. My advice would be to check out your room first when you arrive to make sure its clean BEFORE you unpack all your stuff! I woud prob stay here again.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR110668548", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nokicka"}, {"Content": "Scary My son (age 3) and I travelled to Phx to visit friends. We had booked this hotel through Hotwire. The rooms are dimly lit. There were stains on the carpet and the room was dirty. The sheets would not stay on the bed and often I woke up sleeping directly on the mattress, YUCK!! Every night I had to call the front desk because there were people playing an electric guitar hooked up to an amplifier. This went on for several hours until they finally turned it off. In addition, there were people outside drinking all hours of the night. I certainly did not feel safe here and will NEVER stay at an Extended Stay America again.", "Date": "May 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR994656232", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "msw34145"}, {"Content": "Great stay My husband and I stayed at this hotel as a result of a winning bid through Priceline.com and were not really sure what to expect. The hotel is a little difficult to find, especially at night, as the sign for it is very small and not lighted. Our flight came in late and did not arrive to the hotel until after midnight. I must say this is the only time I have been at a hotel whose front desk closes at night. We arrived to see the reception closed with shutters. I picked up a phone and a person who certainly did not want to be there answered and said she'd be right out. She did not bother to open the shutters to speak to me (as a petite, young female, it is obvious I'm non-threatening!!), and just slid the paperwork underneath the shutters for me to sign. Besides this unpleasant individual, everything else at this hotel was great (I only encountered one other staff member, who was very nice). It seems to be a new hotel, so everything is intact. The room was very spacious, with a king size bed, small desk, small eating table, TV on armoire with drawer space, and closet. Also in the room was a full size kitchen, which included a microwave, toaster, refrigerator, and even some plates and utensils. Everything was clean and comfortable. The bathroom did not have a blow dryer, though I'm not sure if the front desk would provide one upon request. Wireless internet was available for $5.00 for the entire stay. Housekeeping does not come but once per week, and there is a small charge if you want them to come before then. This was not a problem for us, as we rather them not come in to our room. The hotel is at a great location, with tons of shopping and restaurants nearby, as well as the interstate. Overall, we would definitely stay here again! Definitely no luxury to the hotel, but great for business or leisure travel.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR804491598", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "strawberries01"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d74936-r22597081-Extended_StayAmerica_Phoenix_Chandler-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "74936", "Price": "$114"}}

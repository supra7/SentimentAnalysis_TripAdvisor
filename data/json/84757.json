Everything inside the Villa was brand new, and the place was sparkling clean. I stayed in a One bedroom Villa that had everything you could even need. A wide screen HD TV in both the Living room, and another in the bedroom. A new full size stove and refrigerator, dishwasher, micro wave and garbage disposal. Hidden away behind a door was a new Washer and Dryer (Not Coin operated). The grounds were very well kept and beautiful. There were even some exotic birds roaming around, and were very friendly. There was a Great pool with a nice Tiki Bar, the bar man is from England a a super nice guy. I read a review here where someone was worried about the area, As far as i'm converned that made no sense at all, its a nice area. You can only access the property using your room key at the main gate, its a very safe place. I had family staying at a Disney resort (3 times the price for onlly a room) It took me exactly `14 minutes to drive to Disney. There are tons of eating places within minutes of this property. I had a slight problem with the front desk apon check in, but its not even worth talking about. All in all I love the place, and will return the next time I am in Central Florida for sure. In my humble opinion this should be a 3 1/2 Star facility. If you are a couple looking for a romantic stay, or if you are solo, ask for Villa 1007, You will love it.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA Gamble\u201d", "Author": "CCEABen12", "ReviewID": "UR128170815", "Content": "I have stayed at this Resort on two separate occasions. The first time in May 2009 and most recently one night in September 2011. We have stayed in both the regular and updated/renovated villa's and if you have the choice try for the upgraded. The regular villa was out of date and the carpet smelled pretty bad. The sofa's were dirty, the shower curtain rod was rusted and the bathtub scratched. The newer villa was immaculate and modern. The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is very nice. There is a small \"waterfall\" area which is great for small children. The service on both occasions was okay but on our first visit our washing machine jammed and we requested a handy man come in to fix it. Our clothes were stuck in the washer for 3 days before someone showed up. Also we were were charged a small fee for any telephone call we made even if it was local. Our first visit in the modern villa was a good one and lead to us returning on our next trip. On the other hand our second experience made us not want to go back.

Got the room from Hotwire, who listed **1/2 stars. Not sure I would go that far. Driving to the resort, we were really nervous from the area if we were gong to be safe, once on resort, it was just okay. We were there to go to Disney not stay in the resort and relax. Condo was a great size, larger than Disney living room. Kitchen was okay, 2 of the 4 burners did not work, didn't call front desk, sure they already knew. The appliances were out of date. TV's are not flat screens, but we were not there to watch TV, but would have been nice. The remotes backs were broken and had electrical tape to keep batteries in, you had to push really hard with one hand to keep the batteries tight and with your other hand, change the stations. Laundry was nice having it in the room, took 30 minues to wash clothes and 2-1/2 hours to dry. The bathroom was less than desirable, the spout was not attached to the wall, no need to call front desk, housekeeping knew there was an issue, they had just cleaned it. The bed was very comfortable the first night, although the sheets were double stretched on a king size bed. The next morning when I went to stretch the sheets, there were roaches underneath the sheets. I was grossed out. I went and got a can of bug spray and sprayed the room down. I did not want them things coming home with us. After spraying, we found about 5 to 6 dead roaches that afternoon. I washed the sheets and covering and replaced it on our bed. We got these rooms for $50 a night on hotwire. We would NEVER pay the $115 they advertise for these condos. It was about 20 minutes from the parks which were okay with us, however after 6 days, that 20 minutes got really old. They do have transportation to parks, but very limited pick up to and from parks. The staff up in the lobby were very kind, courteous, but not very professional. Inappropriate language used by several of the workers at the front desk.

This resort was an old timeshare that has been sold and is still a timeshare and hotel mixed. Renovations are slow but they are having to (like everything/one) take time to fix it up. Check in was easy and the staff was very nice and helpful as the first room did not work out (needed carpet cleaned), they put us in another unit no problem. The room was outdated but since we knew it would be it was what we expected so can't complain. It is nicer than a standard hotel, because you at least have space to sit in a living room and use of a full kitchen if needed, plus a king bedroom with walk-in closet. The bathroom was kinda small, but had plenty of hot water! The washer/dryer was old and leaked but it served it's purpose, as did the kitchen (the fridge/icemaker and dishwasher worked great). We travel a lot so I always take extra paper products and soap etc. just to make it more home like. The kids loved the peacocks that have run of the property and loved the nice pool area. After a day at the park we could enjoy the very nice pool at night. Resort grounds are small and quaint with a small lake, gazebo, and playground too. The property is located near plenty of shopping and central to a lot of things in Kissimee. It feels very safe. If you are wanting a nice place (with family atmosphere), with nice people to vacation with, this is for you. Nothing spectacular, but worth it for us!!

The website pictures make it look a lot better than it is. Considering we used my aunt's Vacation Exchange, I was expecting better. I'll break down my review in sections. Resort Grounds - From the outside when you enter, the resort looks great. Plenty of trees and there's a pond in the middle of the resort with many different birds species. The pool area is nice as well, with a gazebo covered jacuzzi and little tiki bar at the back. Did not use the Tennis/Basketball Court, Gameroom or Internet Cafe (used a PC in the lobby). Front Desk/Service - Front desk service was okay if we needed something, but daily room cleaning was not included with our stay. This was highly disappointing, and one of the reasons I would not come back here. Also, our Washer/Dryer broke down and they were unable to fix it. Not a big deal as we were on vacay, but another thing to note. Rooms - Our 1 Bedroom Villa was fully equipped, but very dated and in need of an update. This is the other reason I would not recommend this place. Appliances, flooring, walls, furniture all definitely need upgrading. I originally had Westgate Lakes booked but changed over here because of the full kitchen feature. If I knew how it looked here I wouldn't have switched. Location - In relation to Disney and the other main attractions, the resort was a little out of the way. They do offer shuttle service to the main attractions, and there are plenty of restaurants/shopping close by. It's across the street from Osceola Mall, but it's a run down place with mainly discount shops.

The room was small and everything just felt dirty. I wore my socks or slippers the entire time. We were going to stay another month, but luckily I found a WONDERFUL place with three bedrooms, two baths and a large kitchen with granite and a water dispenser for two hundred a month LESS!

The girl at the front desk even told me that even MOTEL 6 has Internet in the rooms, when I asked her why Oak Plantation does not have Internet access in all the rooms! A red flag. I found two dead roaches in the kitchen one morning. The fact that they were dead is a good thing, I suppose. The raccoons are a concern, but are to be expected in that area with all those trees. They are not afraid of humans. The peacocks are pretty to look at.

It sounded like the people above us were moving furniture at 5 AM. That wasn't too great. My daughter and I liked the bracelet making activity every Friday by the pool.

Heavy, clean comforters, FREE delicious breakfast, maid service every day. Oak Plantation has thin blankets. The decor is very early 80's. Another thing I almost forgot...I let my daughter go barefoot once and after a couple of hours, her little feet were BLACK! Don't they shampoo the carpets??? The fridge leaked water.

When something seems too good to be true, IT USUALLY IS. I traveled in a group of two couples in May of 2011 to the Orlando area and stayed at this resort. Check in was easy, area surrounding villas seemed quaint, and generally the villa itself was decent. When I say decent I mean exactly that. If you consider late 80's to early 90's beach decor, uncomfortable beds, and outdated appliances your cup of tea, then hell this may just be your Hilton. We spent one night at Oak Plantation with virtually no complaints until we discovered that there was a lizard in our room and 1:00 in the morning. If you know anything about Florida you know the state is teeming with tiny lizards. It's not a big deal, they're harmless really. We were just going to catch it and throw it outside. Upon moving our bed we discovered several dead COCKROACHES. Yes, you read that right. The vermin of all vermin. Directly below us as we slept. Naturally we were appalled and called management at the hotel as well as Expedia.com customer service, but not before we disgustedly moved the cockroach onto the kitchen floor, so that it's existence could not be denied by the staff! Staff was not helpful whatsoever. Offered us a different room in the same bug infested resort in a different building. To add insult to injury they only offered to comp our stay for one night. We weren't satisfied with this offer, as I'm sure anyone who was a thousand miles from home wouldn't be and demanded to be moved to another hotel. Just as we are on the phone with Expedia who comes to join the party but a tick! (As if needing to sanitize my belongings and buy new luggage wasn't enough.) Due to the fact that it was so late, we decided to stay in another room on the opposite side of the resort and switch hotels early in the morning. We pack all of our things into our rental car, drive to the other side of the resort which is comaprable to a large apartment complex, and walk to our new room which is on the back of a building facing the woods. Just as we think we are done with pests/animals for the day, we encounter two LARGE raccoons at the door of the room. I'm serious, these things were bigger than my dog. We finally got in the room and stayed reluctantly for the next 7 hours until we could change hotels at 8am. It was the worst hotel/villa stay of my entire life and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Side Note: This place is swarming with peacocks. Spring is their mating season, so we had the pleasure of hearing a God awful honking from these birds.

With a room that sleeps 8, we were given 4 towels. Anytime we called to get more they would never come. When housekeeping would come to the room they would only make 1 of the 4 beds and then leave.

Our door wouldn't close properly and it took until half way through the week before it was fixed. Our power also went out one night and it didn't seem like it was a priority to get it back on. As for the staff, with the exception of a select few friendly faces, everyone treated us like we were a complete burden to them just for asking for towels and toilet paper. I talked to multiple managers and they essentially told me that because I didn't come specifically to a manager when these problems happened, there was nothing they could do. One also told us that the staff should have been documenting these problems, but there were none on file.

It is a gated community requiring your room key to get in the gate at the complex which is good. It goes a long way in keeping the rif raf out. The pool is nice, as well as the hot tub. The peacocks are a nice touch too. The office staff was very nice and professional too. There is really nothing else nice to say about this resort. It is sad to see a resort such as this, that could be so awesome, be allowed to deteriorate into what is is now. When we checked in we were assigned an upstairs unit. When we got to that unit the door locks did not work, and it was directly above an area with signs indicated \"Hazardous Materials\". The smoke alarm was dangling from the wires and the room had a strong smell of mildew when we got in. My mother-in-law had recent hip issues so the office was kind enough to change us to a downstairs room, which smelled slightly better and was not located near any \"Hazardous Materials\". In the new room the air conditioner drain was stopped up and someone had stuffed a towel in the closet to catch the drainage instead of fixing it, and the filter was just laid up against the unit and not even installed. A general feeling of uncleanliness was about in the room, especially if you have small kids crawling about. The air vents appeared to have something resembling mold around them, and the dryer had a huge lint build up in the hose to the point we were somewhat concerned about the safety of using it. The maintenance man came to check on the air conditioner, but said he could not do anything for it at that time. At least it did blow cold air. When we checked in there were only four towels, no wash cloths or hand towels. One of the beds was queen size, but had a king size sheet on it that was not fitted and slid off of it every night. It is a stretch to say that the kitchen is minimally stocked, it is BARELY MINIMAL..very basics. I feel very sorry for the office staff for having to try and rent these units in the condition that these units are in. The office staff seem to be very nice people.

Then you go into the bathroom Oh my god how disgusting. The sink overflow looked like it had never had any cleaner near it and as for the rim of the toilet, Black scum all the way round. The Bath had no stopper so you could not have a bath only a shower. The bedroom in fairness was not to bad although the bedding could have been better. (Old Linen). There was also no towels. Went to reception to lodge our complaints. Very nice young girl who said she would get it sorted..Off we then went to get some groceries.. We returned to find out that the bath stopper had been fitted, (well we thought it had been fitted) but as for the rest, nothing had been done. Good job we purchased some cleaning products when we went shopping. We had been travelling all day so had a bite to eat shower's and off to bed. You know i said the stopper had been fitted well it hadn't, it had just been dropped in the hole so unknown to us the water from the shower had leaked straight into the walk in cupboard in the bedroom. The carpet was saturated. Another trip to reception. Again they would get it sorted. Off we went out for the day. On our return, there was a note on our door from an engineer to say they had repaired the bath and the leak and that they had left a dryer on to help dry the carpet which was so loud. Its a wonder our neighbours didn't complain. We informed reception that the dryer needed to stay as the carpet was still very wet but after we came back from dinner it had gone so we just shut the door and lived out of our suitcases. After a few days my wife opened the door to the cupboard and was physically sick from the smell. Yet another trip to reception. Needless to say nothing was done so the door was kept well and truly shut. Only opened on the day of departure. Oh i nearly forgot to mention the bugs. And yes there were loads.. Cockroaches like i have never seen before and some other little bugs that were over the surfaces.

As sson as we walked in the door I breathed a sigh of releaf....there was no horrid smell of smoke as complained about, the apt was clean and no musty smell or odor of any kind which was a prior complaint. The room was a little dated...but that I don't fault or complain about as everything was usable. The washer/dryer combo was something I had never even heard of before...it was the washer then after the washing cycle was done it was the dryer....how cool is that. We did try and do a load which did take a long time and we did have to end up letting our jeans dry by hanging them over a couple of chairs, so not so efficient but if given more time the job could have been successful...we just waited till the last minute to do our laundry. Won't do that next time(yes we will return). The dishwasher worker perfectly and was not all rusted out as previously complained about. We had sufficient cookware and service for 4. We did need a skillet called down and they told us they would bring it in the AM which was fine as we did not need it that night. We then went to wal-mart (just down 192) to get some groceries by the time we returned the skillet was on our counter. The TV's which everyone seems to complain and dwell on are old but very functional. But for us we didn't come to Florida to sit in the hotel/resort to watch TV. We did see little black ants (at night) about 5 each time and every time in the bath tub seeming to be coming out of the drain. But our outlook was and is....its Florida and Ants happen. No other bugs and not an infectation, just Florida to me and hubby. The only thing that me and my Husband agree on was that the mattress at least in 1114 needs replaced...it was a little hard for our tastes and maybe that was just us but we did find that after a few nights it was getting to us. If you like a firm bed you will be satisfied though. All in all I suppose to wrap up the place has been let go a little you can see some shortcuts that have been taken.

Had no bedbugs, cockroaches, or other insects lingering indoors so that was great (big fear)! There was alot of bugs dead and alive outside the door though because of the light which was gross. Main reason we chose this place was because I was travelling with my boyfriend and dad, so we needed space between each other. 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and washer and dryer was great. Yes, the appliances are outdated but thankfully they all worked (the toaster got so hot I'm sure its a fire/safety hazard). The place was clean looking but only if you didnt look too close. One of the couches was stained and gross looking so we tossed an extra sheet over it to sit on. I know it was very dusty because I would get allergy attacks like crazy. We stayed for 10 days, and only the last few days did they clean the bathroom floors and sink(I know because my hair was everywhere and i could see dust), Its true that you have to go to the front desk for towels, which the staff dont seem to want to part with. if they take dirty ones, why cant they always replace them? They only started bringing them to us randomly the last few days there. I ended up washing a load of them and hiding them so i wouldnt have to go ask since the staff made it seem like you were bothering them when you did. They didnt pay good attention to when you needed more toilet paper/paper towels/ soap either. For those of you who have read many reviews, it is true that the mattress covers/pads are way to small for the mattress! they tied them to the mattress so they would stay put haha. But we did have complementary room service and free breakfast. the few times we did go for food we had no complaints. the pool area was nice. the nights are the best times to go, hardly anyone around! we had the pool to ourselves. Never got to try the hot tub though because there was always people in it. the man who works in the tiki bar is not very pleasant. it was like he didnt want to serve you, avoided him after that one visit. 2 of the lightbulbs blew the first day there, but was fixed by the time we returned. So overall nothing major was wrong and ovbiously dont stay here if you are looking for luxury, which we werent. Clean, functioning, and bug-free was my goal and for the most part, that was what we got.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rothesay, Canada", "Title": "\u201c\"Great Location\"\u201d", "Author": "MGlaspy", "ReviewID": "UR119052991", "Content": "Arrived the 24th of Sept and stayed through the 8th Oct.

We stayed at the hotel part of this resort (property near the resort) several years back so we had an idea of the layout of this resort. We started out badly since I called several days before arriving to confirm my reservation, verify my reservation was for a non-smoking room, and made a request for a particular building which was not too far from the pool. The person I spoke to went over which buildings my type of unit were located in, and she said it would be no problem to get my 1 bedroom unit near the pool (I think in building #2). We arrived a the resort around 9:00 at night after a long day of traveling. The unit they directed us to was the building farthest away from the pool where the unit entrance was located behind the building. On top of that all of the outdoor lighting was not working which made my wife quite uncomfortable since we could barely find the way to our unit. To be honest with you this unit was fairly clean, but since my wife did not feel safe in this unit we went back to the office. To make a long story short the person behind the desk offered us several rooms to look at, and some of the rooms were not fit to live in because of the smell in the room, dirty carpets, and they were really in bad need of repairs. When we went back to let her know which room we decided to stay in she saw that we were really disgusted by the condition of some of the units. She was extremely nice and told us to select a unit for the night and the next morning there would be additional units closer to the pool that she could get us into for the rest of our stay. She actually turned what looked like a bad vacation into a very nice relaxing vacation. She set us up in a unit right by the pool, and she continued to make sure the rest of our stay was enjoyable. I have been to many hotels/resorts and I am not someone who demands 5 start accomodations, but some of the units in this resort really need a lot of updating. The resort itself is very nice with the pools, landscaping, internet cafe, and the exterior of the buildings that look great, but be selective on the unit you stay in. We ended up enjoying our stay and having a great time. Like anything else a vacation is what you make of it, and this resort is a nice place to relax.

When I arrived on Wed, checking in took forever because \"rooms were being inspected\". When I entered the room, I don't know who or what they were inspecting because the rooms were filthy with dirty carpets. OMG, you just wont believe how filthy this place is. Imagine living in a neighborhood with hoarders. The doors are dirty. Please do your kids a favor, don't go to this place. I ran to targer to get socks for my children because I would not let them put their feet on those dirty carpet. Now day one, kids went to the pool. Next day went to see friends early and later to Seaworld. Came back to room (I paid extra for housekeeping, don't want to have to do it myself on vacation), oops nothing done. Had pizza with family night before, pizza box still in room with all dishes. Called front desk to complain, clerk tells me \"Let me check to see if you paid for housekeeping\" Sh..t if I did not pay for it, I would not be complaining. No sorry, nothing. Next day, while doing children hair housekeeping comes in, very careless, a little here and there. Before she leaves the room, I tell her \"Are you coming back with towels, answer Yes.\" We leave for fun, come back late night with tired sweaty children, no towels. Called front desk, ask for towels. Clerk tells me he will send towels, now 20 minutes later, My door was being pounded like it was a police, no, FBI doing a raid. Kids were asleep by then, all of them woke up asking what was that. It was late, husband took towel from housekeeping and just closed the door. Now next day, I go to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager, was given the name Sharon Burton, but oops, she can't speak to me because she is having a staff meeting. I was asked to leave my name she will get in touch with me. I'm home now, no call from Sharon Burton. Third day, They did the beds and that was it. Nothing else. All the dirty towels were left all over the bathrooms with no new towels. I swear I'm not making this sh..t up. I did not get upset because I was determined not to ruin my family vacation. Day 5, at around 10:30am housekeeping knocks at door, told lady I'm getting ready to leave to come back later. after disney saw parade, fire works happy mommy happy husband, happy children, walked in my fully paid room with housekeeping...... bed not done, towels from two days ago all over the bathroom. Washed children put them to bed. Called front desk to ask \"What the ....\" answer, nothing can be done now. Name of Sharon Burton given to me again with her extension. Next day checking out. Go to front desk and ask for Sharon Burton, and guess what my readers, Sharon Burton cannot come out because she is in a staff meeting. People this is the first ever review I have written on the internet. Please don't waste your money or time. The place is dirty, the staff is complacent. Oh I almost forgot the best part, day 4, at 8:00 am , call comes in, Mr + Mrs (name), We have a complementary gift for you, when can we bring it? Husband in about an hour. As husband is leaving room to go to car, he sees a middle aged man coming towards our door with two little baskets. Man ask husband, Are you enjoying yourself? Husband tells him, No because of poor service, no housekeeping blahblahblah. Man ask \"Would you be interested in a timeshare on this property? Husband answers---NO. I swear man takes gifts and walks back with gifts and did not give it to us. I'm not mad. I'm just warning you. Don't go There. They are too cheap to take care of the place. The front desk is like a gallery where staff seat and chat. It is unbelievable. Don't Don't Don't book it.

Inside, Lobby area is airy but furniture has seen better days. Front desk staff was very friendly but checkin process was slow due to minimal staffing. Property - The property is fairly large and grounds are well maintained. Peacocks walk freely around and are pleasant to watch. A nice lake with ducks is also on the grounds. Lodging - Door to 1st villa was in need of paint and inside a musty smell, dirty floors and old furniture. Voiced my concerns and was offered the last available villa. This villa also suffered from worn-out furniture and dirty floors but it wasn't as bad. Next day had ants everywhere and sadly it took 2 days for someone to come and spray. Pool - The pool was the best feature at this resort. Clean, large, and centrally located. Hottub was nice too but was not restricted to adults. Movies at poolside was a nice treat. Other Activities - Game Room is small feature with limited games. Basketball courts are nice feature and are lit at night. Internet cafe is also available if you have your laptop but limited hours of operation. Location - convenient to major roads, shopping center and dining options by car.

It's the beginning of some great long lasting friendships.. other than that we'll never stay here again.

They really seem to care about the guests, and often go above an beyond. If it weren't for the staff, I would definately give this resort zero or one stars. I wanted to make that point before continuing with my review. Our Scenario: We own 2 weeks in the Sheraton Vistana, but not this week. We booked this through RCI as a \"last minute vacation\" and our intention was to stay the week and look at real estate propertiies since we are looking to relocate down to Florida. We are on a tight budget, and decided to drive down from NYC to save on air and car rental, and the price for this resort was just right ($300 for the week through RCI). I was hesitant to book based on the mixed reviews, but since my wife and I are not very picky, we decided to take a chance. Accomodations: Check-in was fast and simple, and not one sales person approached us (this is a timeshare). We were given room 512 which was towards the back of the resort. Upon entering the room, we immediately noticed the stains on the carpet, cracked tiles, broken drawers and no sign of any cookware (I like to cook). Normally, I would suck it up and make the best of it. Well, after a 18 hour drive, it didn't take much for us to pick up the phone and complain to the front desk. They must get this response a lot, because they immediately said, \"come to the front desk, and we will let you check out another room.\" We took them up on their offer and ended up in room 1204. This was a 2 story 1 bedroom unit with probably twice as much room as the first unit. This makes me wonder if they just stick the low paying RCI members in their worst units and hope they don't complain. This new unit did not have much cookware either. We called the desk, and within minutes, a guy showed up with a couple of beat up frying pans. It was good enough to cook up some eggs in the morning. This unit was also \"dated\" but functional. The dishwasher would get \"stuck\" midway through the cycle, and would keep running until you advanced the dial a bit. The Washer and dryer was adequate, although we needed to run the dryer twice to get clothes dry. Our biggest issue was the ant problem. These little guys were all over the counters. DO NOT LEAVE ANY FOOD OUT ON THE COUNTERS. We only had 1 remote control, and the batteries were dead, which we had to replace ourselves. The engineering guy never showed up to fix it. The deck outside the bedroom was unusable because there was some major Bird-poop all over (see photo). Also, there is no mid-week exchange of linen or towels as most timeshares have. Grounds and Ammenities: The welcoming Peacocks are wonderful. There was one with 3 little babies in tow. The gounds need some serious work. I did not see one gardner the whole trip. Everything seems brown and unkept. The pool area was nice, but there are many borken pool tiles with sharp edges which are a serious hazard to children and adults. The gym is a joke. I like to keep my workout routine even while on vacation. The machines were antiques, and the AC didn't work. It felt like it was an unsafe 112 degrees in the room. We ended up finding a Planet Fitness right accross the street. It cost us $120 for the week, but at least we are still alive to talk about it. The Wi-Fi is non-existant in the rooms. This screems that the resort needs to be updated. If you are not from the area, you NEED internet access to find your way around. They offer an internet cafe which closes at 5PM (what's the point?) and also a terminal in the lobby. If you need to print something, cross your fingers that the printer is working. Front Desk Staff: Outstanding. They addressed all of our issues immediately. I almost feel bad for them, because I know the short comings of this resort is not their fault, but they take the brunt of the complaints. On our last day in Florida, we had found a property during the day that we liked and put a bid in. Since we were leaving very early inb the morning, we needed to get contracts signed and faxed out. As luck would have it, the printer in the lobby was not working. The girl at the front desk (I think her name was Anelia) was able to print out our documents from her office printer. We then asked her to fax the signed documents for us. Again, as luck would have it, our real estate agent's fax machine was not working. We finally found another solution, but we were almost 30 minutes past Anelia's quitting time. She stuck with us and we were able to eventually get the documents faxed, and we are now one step closer to moving down to Florida. Thanks again to the staff. Conclusion: It appears that there may not be enough owners in this property to finance a \"make over\" It's too bad, because the \"bones\" of the resort are good, but it appears that they are 20 years out dated, and ore using the bandaid method to stay afloat. I wish them the best, but I cannot reccommed this resort. I can look past a lot of things, but even I had a hard time doing that. If I had to call the desk for every issue, I would have been on the phone every day.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesapeake, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cDon't believe what you hear.\u201d", "Author": "Jenn612", "ReviewID": "UR112971463", "Content": "After reading all the negative reviews I almost changed my reservation but I could not find another place that had a full kitchen for the week I needed it. I arrived at the Plantation on Sunday 6/5 and THANK GOD I did not switch. When we arrived we were greated by a very nice front desk clerk that checked us in. She told us the room would not be ready until 4pm, but we could enjoy the resort. We went to layout by the pool and had a awsome day. We got hotdogs for $1.00 (every sunday) and also had sundae's for $2.00 starting at 3pm. At around 4 we checked into the room which was located near the basketball court (very quite). Our unit was clean, we had towels but no washcloths. I went to the front desk and got them right away without any problems. The kitchen appliances all worked to include the washer and dryer. I would agree that there could have been more utensils in the kitchen (ex. a strainer for mac and cheese, cookie sheets for baking). I do not believe that there is enough to cook a full meal but I was on vacation and was not looking to do that anyway. My hubby and I ate dinner out every evening anyway. We had a 1-bedroom, 2 story unit and it was AWSOME!!!! The pools were outstanding, the hot tub only had a few jets working but it wasn't the end of the world. I have been to Florida approx. 10 times and usual stay in the seaworld area but wanted to try something a little different. Oak Plantation is not a 4 star property but for a vacation involving parks that will ware you out this place is perfect. It's wonderful to get back to in the evening and sit out by the pool that is open until 1am. This place is excellent for family's esp. with small children. If you are a person who is looking for the Hilton at Oak Plantation prices this may not be the place for you. I am an easy going person that wants a decent place to stay. Not looking for the \"BEST\" but not the \"WORSE\". Oak was perfect and I will be going back without a doubt!

I believe they were bed bugs. It was the worst bed i have ever slept in and i couldn't sleep the whole night because i felt like bugs were crawling on me. It was disgusting. The next day we told them we wanted to change rooms because ours had BUGS in it. They didn't seem to even care and said they are full and not sure if they can move us. I demanded and they gave us another room. This room was better and cleaner but i never could get the first room out of my mind. Not that the new one was great..it had left over ice cream in the freezer and still no clean towels, but at least the beds were bug free it seemed. I still can't believe how horrible this condo is..it looked so nice on the websites. Don't believe any good reviews on this condo...they are all LIES.....i have never wrote a review on a hotel before..but this condo should be condemned.

I was laying back on the couch one evening and all of a sudden I heard a tick tick noise and look down and saw a HUGE cockroach on the floor!

You feel like you are camping in the woods not on a sunny resort. -OK So heres the lowdown on the managment at this resort. We called down to the front desk on day 1 when we arrived and told them that we were not please with the rooms conditions. There response was well thats all we can do call EXPEDIA where you booked your stay. We were shocked and responded to them \"Expedia cant clean our rm...lol That being said they offered us a VIP cleaning. We went to Universal the next day and gave them the benefit of the doubt that the rm will be much better when we returned the next day. However the only visable change was now there were towels on the racks oh and by the way they told us we were responable to wash them???

Buildings 1,4, 15 and 14 are right on the pool, but im not sure what the inside looks like, but i assume they have not been renovated. The pool, hottub and outdoor tiki bar are great, clean. There are $1 hotdog and $2 ice cream sundaes daily at the pool which is fun. The tennis courts, basketball and activities center are well kept. Next to blg 2 is the breakfast which is only $3 for kids buffet style and $6 for adults. I was impressed with the property as a whole and the service except for the old guy bartender at the tiki bar. he is an jerk. He should be fired as he taints the overall perception of the facility. There are some not well maintaned aspects of the complex that can be easily fixed, which show an overall degredation of the facility No internet except in the pool and internet cafe, but i tethered my bb and got internet no problem, so its wasnt an issue for me Other posts say its close to disney and other locations, i felt it was too far. 22 min to disney park entrance and its past mile marker 15 on sr192.

For 2 hrs it was only $100 and there were a bunch of islands to explore. I would skip any fan boats and rather rent a boat to explore the lakes. Other posts said the planes that fly over from kissimmee airport were an issue, but the noise was not bad since they were small jets. We thought it was neat to show the kids the airplanes landing and taking off. This is definately a kids friendly place and some of the older couples you could tell had an issue with all the kids. The complex is well protected via gate and we felt very safe the whole time. The peacocks everywhere are fun and very beautiful. Definately very unique to see peacocks walking all over the place with their beautiful feathers. The workout center is garbage. i wouldnt even call it a fitness center as it has one machine, 2 treadmills, one that was broken. it was extremely hot and small.

Cleaners in everyday for no extra charge. Had breakfast once, very poor quality. Polystyrene plates and cups, low quality food, with little range, all self service including rubbish disposal. HOWEVER a self catering resort with wallmart over the road so not bothered too much. We had a few ants one evening so we called the front desk and within 15min a chap came with some spray. No ants to be seen again. The biggest issues were the lack of enthusiasm from the staff. They did there job, but always seemed to be moaning about the lack of this or that in front of guests. The other issue was the poor quality breakfast. Would stay again, were out all day, so only there to sleep and have breakfast.

It is very easy to just relax and do nothing. The staff we dealt with were always friendly and helpful. We were there for almost 2 months and with one exception loved it. The problem was always with the cleaning. Even though they were always polite and sympathetic when I complained about the quality of the cleaning, it takes away some of your pleasure to have to complain. They badly need to remove the old filthy carpets and put in something like tile that is easily maintained. Especially as they don't use the vacuums very often.

I was pretty worried after reading all of the negative reports, but all in all this place is not the hell hole others would have you believe. First of all, if you can request it, ask for building #2. It is the closest building to the Main lobby, the exit, the breakfast building and is very close to the pool area. I'll try to address some of the complaints others have written about. Cockroaches and ants. I didn't see any roaches but did see 1 ant the whole week we were there. It didn't put up much of a struggle. Tube TVs: Yes, there weren't any 40 inch HD flat screen LCD or Plasma TVs here. For those of you who hate watching Oprah or Jerry Springer on anything less, you might need to look elsewhere for accomodations. For those of you who only need the weather channel in order to plan your day they are fine. Cleanliness: I can only speak about our unit, and it was fine. The kitchen floor and living room carpet weren't clean enough to eat off of, but I can't do that at home either. It would have been nice to have had a vacuum cleaner in the unit, but it is what it is. Less work for me, more work for the cleaning staff when I check out. Outdated or rusted appliances: Our washer and dryer seemed fairly new, and I didn't notice any glaring rust on the refrigerator or dish washer. I was just trying to remember if there was any rust on the stove or washing machine in my room at the 5 star Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas or the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas...oh wait, those rooms didn't have any appliances in them at all. All the appliances worked just fine. Lack of towels or other items: Nope, our family of 4 had enough of everything. We washed all our towels halfway through our trip. No big deal. Poor breakfast buffet: I booked through Expedia and the package included a free breakfast buffet for 2 people the entire 7 days we were there. If you're the type of person to complain about FREE food, stop reading right now. Yes the selection did not change for the whole week, but who cares? Scrambled eggs, sausages, breakfast potatoes, bagels, cream cheese, toast, cinnamon buns, oatmeal, cold cereals, a waffle maker with whipped cream and fruit, coffee, tea, fruit juices and milk were available every day. Who eats better than that for breakfast every day? The staff in charge of the room didn't even mind if you snuck out a cup of coffee or some food. The area is unsafe: Really? It's a gated area accessed by your room key and there is security patroling the grounds around the clock. I didn't see anything that would suggest the area is dangerous. Noisy: The only noise I heard were the peacocks in the mornings. I was afraid we were making too much noise with our nightly Yahtzee game. Something that surprised me were all of the activities they had planned at the resort. We didn't partake in any of them since we spent each day out at the parks, but I thought it was a nice touch. Maybe I just got lucky and got a nice unit, but let's get real. You didn't pay for the Ritz Carlton, so why expect it? Our unit had lots of space and my 2 kids each got their own bed to sleep in. Last year we stayed at the Lake Buena Vista Resort Village and Spa. That resort is ranked much higher than this one and the price relects that.

We arrived at 130pm and had all the paperwork completed, but the key was not available till 4pm. So we decided to take a trip to Downtown Disney and get a bite to eat. When we arrived back at 530pm, the key was waiting for us. We were in Building 5 and upon entering, right away I looked for any of the conditions that were stated in several reviews. I did not find any bugs and the place was pretty well cleaned. Yes it could have been cleaned a little better, but it was in pretty good condition. Yes the place does need to update the furniture, but that did not bother me since everything was still in good condition. The room looked freshly painted. I did rent the 2 bedroom Villa with Housekeeping service, which I recieved the first 2 days we were there, but the last 3 days we had no housekeeping at all. We found a bag of towels at our door on the 3rd day and it lasted us the rest of the week so I did not complain about it. We found that the Washer and Dryer worked well. We did purchase a sheet at Target for the bed, since the one that they had on the bed did not fit well, Only cost $10, so it was no big deal and I would rather have my own sheet then one that has been well used. Air conditioning worked well and only bugs that I really saw maybe 3 times, were a waterbug . Which of course you will find anywhere in a hot weather climate. I found the place enjoyable and would have liked to take part in some of the activities they offered, but with our limited time schedule there and a 4 day pass to disney, it made it quite impossible.

The dishwasher was rusty in and out, the refrigerator was rusty, the safe was broken and the vent fan in the bathroom was dangling by it's wires. The dryer was broken, they tried to fix it 4 times, then while we were out they replaced it, that one didn't dry either, I told them the vents were clogged, as they both kept overheating and stopping, they never cleaned them. I was told the bathroom vent hung, because they didn't have the right sized one. They said they couldn't replace the battery in the safe, because the company was out of business, and they couldn't get the reset tool fixed. The pool had patches of algae on the sides.

It has a wonderful pool area, the basketball and tennis courts. Those facilities are still in nice shape, but the rest of the place has gone to hell. The fitnes center is shut down.

Initially, like many others, we were concerned about the negative reviews given by a few people on this site, so we called the resort ahead of our stay and questioned a lady called Asha about these reviews. She assured us that changes had been made, and that things were improving. On arrival at the site, we saw, what can only be described as a very pretty resort complex, well lit, very clean, well designed and very tranquil, all coupled with lots of well kept natural vegetation and tree's. The reception was excellent, and luckily on arrival, around 8.00pm, we met Asha. We introduced ourselves and we were greeted in the usual Floridian manner, all smiles and very polite. We requested somewhere quiet, away from the pool as we don't have any children and wanted to relax. We were kindly given apartment 1212, which was located on the upper level. On first inspection the rooms were clean, tidy, and well fitted out with the usual equipment that is found in every other villa and apartment. The only downside was a slight bit of dirt beside the cooker, and some staining on the grout in the bathrooms. But when you consider the amount of use these resorts get, coupled with what must be some very difficult and sometimes dirty people, who use these facilities for a few weeks, and then to turn them around for the next set of customers, must be very difficult. So bearing that in mind, we went to Wal-Mart and bought some kitchen cleaner with bleach for 0.98 cents which solved the problem. By the way, Wal-Mart is approximately half a mile to the west, marker 15. Fab place to shop, again and again and again. Breakfast ! Our breakfast was included in our package price which consisted of, fresh scrambled eggs, freshly cooked hot sausages, hot potatoes, hot porridge, hot fresh waffles, (yummy) fresh cinnamon swirls, cereals, cold milk, tea, coffee, fresh bread, bread rolls, and various yoghurts. All very nice and great to set yourself up before going to the parks, especially as you can eat as much as you want. Overview. Is Oak Plantation worth the money? We paid \u00a3693.00 each, so a grand total of \u00a31386.00. This included direct BA flights to Orlando MCO from LGW, 2 weeks at the Oak Plantation including breakfast. This is a no brainer ! ! ! We have stayed at Mystic Dunes, Summer Bay, Sheraton Vistana, Lindfield Villas, Southern Dunes several times, and you are right, this is not the same as these resorts, but we didn't pay anywhere near the same amount of money as these top resorts. Would we stay again? Damned right. Lovely people, great service, great shopping mall right across the road which has Beales, Ross, and Burrington Coat Factory, a pound shop and Cici's pizza. Just for reference, Cici's offer all you can eat buffet for $5.99, or a 15\" pizza for $4.99. Also be aware that this is not a HoJo's or Comfort inn, these are fully equipped apartments, and once again, we have come home with no dirty washing as there are laundry facilities in each apartment. Like most people in this world, if you treat the staff with respect, and treat them as you would like to be treated yourself; you will be amazed at how far a smile can go. In conclusion, we shall be back. Thanks Asha and staff for a lovely stay, and hope to see you soon.

We moved our stuff to the new place and found it tollerable initially although it had several issues after further inspection such as rusted appliances, non working dryer, stained carpet, more ants, unmade beds. Our plan was to prepare some meals there but we skipped that idea because there were very few cooking utensils supplied as promised by their description not to mention the ants and filthy conditions. It is hard to believe they actually charge money for this a facility in this kind of condition but it is evident the owners do not re-invest any money in personell or property maintenance.

A lot of restaurants in the neighborhood. Everything is a little older and some things need a little maintenance and upgrading, but for 2 1/2 stars it is okay.

Only scrumbled eggs and sausages, make your own waffels, cereals, canned fruit and the standard stuff, a 4 out of 5. But the park was about 25-30% occupied, may be it had to do with that. Only few people for breakfast, everybody had his own kitchen also. Internet in the cafe, not in the room, but as you see how large the lot is you can image it costs a lot to realise internet in each room. You could Wifi 24 hours a day on the terrace and by the pool via your own notebook. As you need a PC the internetcafe was open limited hours. Service could be upgraded. Toner from the printers in the cafe was empty for days. They said they ordered new cartridges. Hello... within a mile there were plenty shops that sell HP cartridges . Had to let my boardingpasses printed by the receptiondesk. Got prints with heavy black stripes on it, so at the airport thay were not readable. On arrival the telephone in the room did not work and they could not have it back online during my 10 day stay.

We got up the stairs with all our luggage only to find that the place smelled, there were no towels, no toilet paper, the stove didn't even open, and it was dirty. I clean houses for a living and this really upset me. I know how to clean and these people need a lesson in cleaning. We called and complained and we were transferred to a villa near the pond and the pool. This one was much cleaner and you could tell it had been cleaned before we came. We were told that Dominos delivered until 4am. Not true. We had been lost, bad villa, and then we couldn't eat. Now we had to go find food when we have no idea what is available. Needless to say our trip started out badly. I was kind of expecting some kind of compensation because of all the garbage and the fact that we were still charged for Wednesday night when we didn't arrive until 2 a.m. Thursday kind of bothered me. I know that we allready paid but with all the stuff we went through at this time of the morning I felt that we could have been given some kind of discount. The rest of our trip was very decent. We had housekeeping every day except when my brother didn't want them to come in. We had a great time at the pool and the sundaes were a nice compliment in the hot weather. I would have liked them to have sprayed the pool area for fire ants though, they were biting me a lot on Thursday. We did go to the Magic Kingdom and Seaworld. It was nice that this resort was within minutes from them. We did not take the shuttle there at all because I felt we shouldn't have to pay to go there when other places bring you complimentary. I was upset that the internet was not wireless. I am a college student that needed to do my homework when I was on vacation. I could not concentrate in the pool area and the internet cafe was only open from 1-9 and I didn't understand why. Why wouldn't this just be open all the time? Since we were so close to the pool, I decided that I would try to get the internet and to my surprise it worked!!! I could do my homework in the villa. I wish I would have found this out sooner. I do think that the staff were very nice in the am shifts. The night shift people that we dealt with were not very courteous. I even asked to see the second villa before we moved into it and it seemed to irritate them. I wanted to see what the next one would look like.

That is not likely to change as they are \"understaffed\", which was a comment made to my father-in-law by a staff member in the welcome office. The staff that are there are skilled at driving golf carts, but not much else. A few observations: The main pool was closed when we arrived, with yellow plastic \"caution\" tape circling it. The pump had failed and the water was no longer being filtered. It was quite green and dirty looking. This was repaired on Thursday, four days after we arrived and three days before we departed. Perhaps there are few pool maintenance companies in Florida. The other, smaller pool, was working but the heater had failed so the water was quite cold. As for the baby pool, the water coming out of the \"fountain\" was less than clear. Also, the fountain was constructed from metal pipes that were rusting and not very safe. At the pool, the bar and social area was pretty rundown, with dirty green plastic grass carpet on the deck. The drinks dispensed were pretty weak, and the pina coladas weren't mixed properly. At night there was music blaring out of old beat up speakers. Not a very relaxing scenario. The tennis court was relatively new but the net had no tape so it was about 5 inches too high. And one of the gates had a broken latch so you couldn't close the gate. Disappointing as we do enjoy playing tennis every day. The unit where we stayed was relatively clean, but had its issues as well. No door stop, so the front door would bang against the wall. The clothes dryer didn't vent to the outside because the pipe was clogged. Basically a fire hazard. The stove had only one element/burner working, and it had two settings: off and high and hot. No medium or low heat. You could hear people walking around upstairs which was a minor nuisance. The playground for kids was operational but getting tired. Just not maintained at all. We stayed there because the time share our in-laws had was full, so this was the only place with available space. We now know why. Keep in mind, the place is attractive when you walk through, it's just poorly maintained and calling the staff is useless. Day after day when we went to the office, there were vacationers complaining about one thing or another to the staff, who just weren't equipped to help. My guess is the turnover rate is very high. Location About a 25 minute drive from Disney. Too far for our taste so we only went once and stayed the whole day. It's near many strip malls and chain restaurants. Not an attractive area, and the failing economy is very evident. Many closed restaurants, and boarded up businesses. I would guess this place will go under and the owners will try to sell. Good luck, it will be hardly livable by then. The only reason I would stay here again is if it was $50 per night and I couldn't find a place any closer to Disney.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAn absolute shamble.\u201d", "Author": "surprized", "ReviewID": "UR61603535", "Content": "I'll break this down room by room, but let me start by telling you that you'll be charged for your full length stay before you even arrive. We booked in late February for an April vacation. Our \"villa\" was the two bedroom, 2 bath with kitchen. It boasted 3 T.V.'s and a safe. Mind you I read some reviews and became very concerened so I called two weeks in advance to ask why they had such bad reviews. The woman I spoke to assured me that all these problems had been resolved that they had new staff that addressed housekeeping and mechanicals. Keep in mind check out is 10am and check in is 4pm. Upon arrival between 4pm and 4:30 it took 50 min. to check in. My husband noticed others were having issues with checking in but primarily that rooms were not ready. Upon entering our \"villa\" we noticed what looked like the door had been kicked in at one time and a LARGE dead bolt was in it's place. It smelled musty and smokey. At first glance it seemed OK however as we walked around we found the following: **Kitchen** Broken glass in the sink, oven was warm inside and heating elements were dangling but it was shut off. Floor was absolutely filthy with dirt and food. **Bathrooms** Smelled of urine because there was urine on the toilet seat and all around. Hair in the tub and sink. Shower walls had a layer of soap scum. Safe in master room was missing and it appeared it had been literally torn out of the wall with drywall hanging. **Bedrooms** All 3 beds in the \"villa\" needed a change of linens eventhough the beds were made I felt the need to check the sheets and to my dismay they had dirt, crumbs, lots of hair and stains on them including the pillows . A few of the pillows didn't even have casses on them. All three T.V. remotes were either missing batteries or they were dead. The carpet and all flooring was filthy with old dust and dirt in the corners. Most of the windows were unlocked (1st floor) and when my husband tried to call for housekeeping to request clean sheets, towels (because there were none) and batteries he realized the phone wasn't working. We used my cell phone to call. The phone was replaced fairly quickly by a nice gentlemen, however by then we still didn't have towels or sheets. Oh yes did I mention there wasn't any toilet paper either?! Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting and having called for housekeeping 3 times our final call was to inform them that we were leaving and finding someplace else to stay. Wouldn't you know it miraculously the manager (a man) and a woman who claimed she inspected the room herself knocked on our \"villa\" door. I at this time had already shut the master bedroom door to make phone calles using the yellow pages for an availble hotel with pretty much the same ammenaties. By this time it was 8:30pm. I was VERY fortunate to have a man on the other end of the line that was patient, understanding and accomodating to the point that he googled directions and in detail explained how to get to the hotel from our present location. In the meantime my husband tried explaining and showing all the discrepencies. I won't bore you with anymore details but I assure you they did not see it our way nore did they see the need for us to leave however the manager offered to clean it himself but that we should return the next day to complete our stay at the \"villa\". My husband very nicely declined the offer and explained that were were leaving and that we expected a full refund. In summary, we checked out and arrived at our beautiful, CLEAN hotel at 10:00pm where we enjoyed the rest of the week without worry. Housekeeping was prompt, friendly and when we requested extra towels or blankets they were ther within a few short minutes. Not to mention a complimentary breakfast and open bar and dinner each night for 1.5 hours (also complimentary). That's what I call service and it was only $50/day more.

I stayed there last week and the place is going to the dogs. I know it changed hands a two of years ago, but the up keep is a disaster in the room.

The pillows were flat, so we request 4 extra pillows. The bedspread was wore and stained; They send someone over with another bedspread.

Kids stayed so busy they spent and entire day resting when we arrived back home. We enjoyed swimming in the pool (1 was heated and 1 was not) plus there was a large water kiddy play area for toddlers. The Jacuzzi was working great so on the chilly nights kids would go from one to the other. The grounds are peaceful, no noisey busses shuffling guests around. We spent our mornings walking the loop around the pond, kids saw turtles, birds, ducks, fish and had fun with the peacocks. My friend used the pond as a scenic place for her family photo. Last year when we were there they chased around baby peacocks so it was fun to see how big they have gotten. The time, we stayed in the loft which had plenty of room for us. We had extra pillows and blankets stored in the closets for the fold -out -couch. Things were simple, not elaborate but clean and that is important! We did notice a few changes in the resort one being the towel pool service, you now have to check them out as the front desk, but that's not a bad thing as in previous stays there was wasted towels scattered all over the pool deck that a paid employee had to gather up. The other being the children's activities they were not scheduled as in previous stays but to be honest I think my kids were the only ones participating at times. The sandcastle contest and pool games were often empty so while we enjoyed them in past stays I can understand why they may not have them all the time due to lack of participation. When we stayed this past week there were so many activities that we could not possible do everything, the kids played basketball (again, checked out the ball at desk), the tennis courts were active, the workout room also had several people in there doing cardio machines, they had Bingo night with FREE pizza and prizes for $ at the tiki bar or general store, comedy night by the pool (couldn't tear the kids away to have dinner), big screen TV movie night by the pool, a childrens playground and sandcastle area, there is a game room at the resort but we walked across the street to the mall and kids played in the larger one. One night we walked across to Friendlys and ordered ice cream to go, not have to load kids up in the car was great! We brought games out to the pool, other families were playing cards, scrabble, catch with the football, etc. I even caught a few making up there own pool games! They have a wonderful Tiki bar, the bartender played some fun music and cooked up some yummy Cubans, cheeseburgers, chicken fingers and fries. I heard a few comments from other resort guests that they missed the children activities (specifically the tie die shirts), but as I recall you had to pay for those so not like it was a very popular craft. Of course the few that made comments were also enjoying the 2 for 1 happy hour at the tiki bar! The staff was extremely friendly, I was greeted at the front desk with smiles, I was even allowed to get in the room early to let the kids change into bathing suits. While I waited on the children to change I noticed to ladies cleaning my room, one in the kitchen who emptied the ice bin and rinsed it out, she also wiped down all the shelves in the refrig. The location is very convenient to many restaurants, parks and other fun activities. They have free internet access around the pool so many were on the computer, there is also an internet cafe which has free sodas and snacks and free coffee in the lobby.. You can choose to cook breakfast or eat at the all you can eat buffet for only $5.95, kids got to make there own waffles and top with fruit and whipped cream.

Shower head squirting out water horizontally right through the bathroom door into the kitchen. Husband took apart shower head nozzle and re-attached it and then the water came out in one jet stream. Made for a painful shower.So when maintenance man finally appears in casual clothes and sports jacket-doesn't even know how to adjust pliers. He's got the dishwasher pulled out from under sink to get at piping--shower head apart and wants to send a repairman out tomorrow to fix everything. Maintenance guy said freezer parts were missing that deflects cold air into the fridge so he leaves and comes back with plastic parts in his hand which he stripped from another fridge. Go figure.

Any other timeshare supplies kitchen dish soaps, dishwasher soap and at least one laundry detergent. 2.-- Had to call for towels--Only enough towels for one person. Shouldn't have to call for towels for a unit that is ready to accommodate 4 people. Should have enough towels for 4 people to start with. The same thing happened again after exchanging rooms. 3.--Ice tray from freezer had mold in it. Second room #512- inconsistencies.--No extra blanket or pillows or bedding for pull out couch.

They do provide towels except you have to walk to the front desk and sign for the towels...if you lose them they are $10 each. 5. Grounds \u2013 needed maintenance.

We returned, put our groceries away and went out to our other daughter's softball tournament. We returned to find the refrigerator wasn't terribly cold; it made noise but didn't work well.

It would be cleaner.\u201d", "Author": "Gnaw71", "ReviewID": "UR57443660", "Content": "I read the reviews and firmly believe that grumpy people get grumpy people. Old furnishings doesn\u2019t always mean a bad hotel and some people when it comes to cleanliness are a little too picky. I\u2019ll try to provide the good points first, but this is proving to be a challenge. The location was close to SeaWorld and Disney. The lobby was nicely decorated for the season with a Christmas tree, a Menorah and 6 foot tall nutcrackers. The grounds, from what I saw of them at my 11:30 pm check in, where well maintained with a nice looking pool area and I looked forward to using the free car wash facilities. This is where the good ended and the bad began. The check in was slow and I was surprised at the number of times the phone rang at the front desk. There was a disgruntled guest at the front desk looking for towels. I just figured he had a long day and was a little grumpy\u2026..boy was I wrong and I now understand why. Once Jeffrey at the front desk appeased his concerns by having security grab some towels, the guest left and I can only guess went back to his room. During this time the phone continued to ring incessantly. From what I could ascertain everyone needed towels. Once checked in, our horror story began. Upon entering the room I didn\u2019t see the tell tale vacuum marks on the carpet but I chalked this up to just being an older carpet. I knew that the rooms looked a little dated by the photos and most of the reviews that I had read. I didn\u2019t care I just needed a place for a week that was clean and was reasonably priced. About $1100 US with the bulk of the time in off season seemed reasonable for a place that rated 75% on TripAdvisor and came referred by CAA. After all, we weren\u2019t spending our days in the room only eating suppers and sleeping there. We folded out the hide-a-bed and low and behold, no bedding. At this point I opened a bi-fold door thinking it was a closet, only to discover the furnace/air conditioner. The air filter had obviously never been replaced. It was dirt ladened and had holes throughout. There were dust balls in this little cubby the size of cats. I thought I\u2019ll deal with this in the AM we can leave the window open\u2026. Darn wouldn\u2019t you know it - no screen\u2026. Seeing this dirt, led me to check the cleanliness of the rest of the room. The dust behind the fridge was thick from the coils to the wall. There were dust webs and filth behind the stove, and a few lady bugs on the floor (the bugs, to me, were no big deal after all they were dead and in a corner and we were in Florida). The dishes were put away dirty and there were M&M\u2019s loose in one of the cupboard shelves. The only thing that I felt was really clean was the tub, toilet and bathroom sink. At least they sparkled. At this point I made sure there were no bugs along the King size bed edge, and THANK GOD there weren\u2019t. I proceeded up to the front desk to complain and to get some bedding for the kids. Jeffrey seemed genuine in his apology and gave me a blanket from the office and asked the security officer to get the rest of the bedding for me. He tried to find me another room but apparently the 3 rooms available still were not cleaned from the previous day. This was a Tuesday December 29th check in and they still hadn\u2019t cleaned the room by 12:15 am on the Wednesday!!!! When I returned to the room, I met another couple from Ontario who advised me not to leave any food out and to keep it in the fridge. \u201cThe ants are bad,\u201d I was told and \u201cOh by the way don\u2019t ask for towels you won\u2019t get any\u201d When I returned to my room, my kids told me that there was no way they could sleep in the hide-a-bed. My daughter of less than 70 lbs sank into it like it was and inner-tube. Upon inspection, the underside of the mattress was virtually missing with cuts and tears throughout. Thank God for the King bed because that is where we slept for the night. Several minutes later, the security officer arrived with a sheet and 1 pillow case. This was all there was. I invited him in to ask his opinion of the room. We found more dirt! There was dust hanging out of the bathroom fan and dried spit along on the wall that had run down and clumped just shy of the baseboardll! It was obvious that the paint in the washroom had been done straight over dirty walls. He agreed with me that the room was deplorable and that he wouldn\u2019t stay there in these conditions. Unfortunately, at this time of the night there were no other options. The night sleeping four in one bed was not the last straw. I decided that perhaps I was a victim of unfortunate circumstances. In the morning things would look better\u2026 They didn\u2019t. I figured a shower and a coffee would change my mind. To my chagrin and the very last thing that put this whole experience over the top was one of the two towels we had was full of holes. We packed up and went up to the front to leave. Dawn (the supervisor) was pleasant and understanding and quickly processed my request to leave. I asked to speak to the manager (Christina Lopez) to advise her of the condition of the room and to at least give a little kudos to the staff that all tried, be it failed, to make my stay pleasant. Dawn, Jeffery and the Security Officer (whom I think I\u2019d rather keep nameless) were as pleasant as possible and appeared to be genuinely apologetic, but it seemed to me that they felt their hands were tied by the circumstances. Christina also apologetic tried to make excuses for the whole event. New cleaning manager, new towel service, can we put you in one of the owner rooms with new TV\u2019s etc. etc. etc. It wasn\u2019t the furniture or the appliances, it was the cleanliness that led to my decision to leave!!! My biggest regret is that I didn\u2019t take pictures. With the dirt of the place we didn\u2019t bring anything in but a suitcase and the cameras were buried in the trunk. In conclusion, DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! CONSIDER OTHER PLACES!!!! To add insult to injury as of Feb 02 2010 they still had not processed the credit for the room. There was a beautiful charge of about $950 but surely no credit. This has been turned over to MasterCard at this point. Phone calls to Christina Lopez with several voicemails were never returned. Just prior to posting this I finally reached Christina\u2026You guessed it more excuses.

If you are looking to have a bad experience, then you will get one here. There is nothing \"enchanting\" about this place. This \"resort\" is pretty much what all of the negative reviews say that it is. The service is HORRIBLE and the room leaves a lot to be desired as it has not been updated probably since the early 80's. The room smelled of bug spray when we first got there. There was a lot of dust which indicates that the room had not been thoroughly cleaned in a very long time. My kids found a dead frog and dead insects in their room. Some of the windows did not lock, which created a safety issue especially with having kids in the condo. My husband located a stick from outside to wedge in the window to keep it from being opened from the outside. We had 6 people (2 adults, 4 kids) which the \"resort\" was very aware of. Requesting towels for 6 people was a chore every single day, as we had to call 2-3 times for anyone to respond. When we did receive the towels it was a grounds worker or security guard who delivered them. We even gave the first worker a substantial tip, and still did not receive towels without arguing with the staff. There are so many complaints. PLEASE EXPECT YOUR ROOM NOT BE CLEANED DURING YOUR STAY!!! The staff attempted to make 2 of the beds one day, and 1 bed another. We had a 2 bedroom condo, which has a total of 3 beds. The sheets on the king size bed did not fit, so we had to figure out a way to keep the sheets on the mattress so that we would not directly touch it during the night. The dirty towels were not removed from the room except for 1 day when we happened to be there when a housekeeper came in, and we requested that she take them. They did leave some extra sheets. I guess they expected us to wash the towels and change the sheets. After the first two nights in these conditions we tried to get out of this \"resort\". It took so much of our time. Instead of enjoying the parks we were on the phone dealing with the staff. We even contacted AAA who we booked the \"resort\" through and they were even unsuccessful in getting this resolved. Unfortunately, the \"resort\" had already taken our money for the week, so getting another hotel to accommodate 6 people (2 adults, 4 kids) was impossible because of the busy Disney season. My husband also argued with the staff in trying to get another room, only to find that the condo they were going to move us to was in worse condition than the one we had. The \"resort\" staff became frustrated knowing that they could not accommodate our requests nor most of the other guests requests, and even admitted this to us. They also admitted to the hotel being \"poorly managed\" by the owner. We talked to everyone that we possibly could at this \"resort\" including management, with no resolve. They offered us free breakfast, but based on the condition of everything else, it turned my stomach to even think that they would even serve food, so we did not take them up on this offer.

For that price, it was an absolute steal. At full price (~$100)/night, you can do better. The place was, as expected, a little older. The rooms are apartment-style - a bedroom and attached bath, with a separate living room/kitchen area. This allowed for a lot more privacy than the standard bed, table, and TV hotel room. There were also 2 TVs - one in the bedroom, one in the living room. The kitchen had an oven, stove, microwave, full-size fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer combo, and a decent selection of dishes and cookware. All were somewhat dated, and were obviously not top of the line when they were new, but they got the job done without any problems. Breakfast was available every morning for $5.95/person. It was good and filling, if a bit repetitive (same food every morning, but enough selection to not have to eat the same meal every day). The area was good enough - several restaurants (Red Lobster, Ponderosa, etc.) were within walking distance, as well as a grocery store and Walgreens. It didn't seem to be a very sketchy part of town. Of course, the main reason we stayed here was the free shuttle to the parks. While we were disappointed that they didn't offer an airport shuttle (round-trip cab fare is ~$100, Mears shuttles will run you ~$40/person round trip), the shuttles to the theme parks were very convenient. They go to the Disney Transportation and Ticket Center 3 times in the morning (as early as 7:00), and pick up from there 3 times as night (as late as 10). They also go to Universal and Sea World twice a day (First trip out at 8:30, last return around 8:00). We had 2 shuttle drivers while we were there, and they were exact opposites. Larry was great - he was pleasant, courteous, and willing to share lots of tips about making the most of the parks, if you asked. He kept the radio off while driving, and was always on time. Angie was terrible. She played the radio loudly while driving, causing parts of the van shake and buzz, often ran late (as much as 30 minutes), and was often insincere in her pleasantries. Although Angie was the only one to hang a tip cup in the van when she drove, Larry was the only one to receive a tip. Thankfully, Larry is the regular driver, and Angie is just the stand-in when he's not there. One final note - in our room, we managed to get an internet signal, if just barely, from the poolside internet connection. It was available 24 hours a day, unlike the internet cafe.

I did not care for the guest services employee one bit, who immediately tried to book us a \"free breakfast\" upon our arrival, which was of course in actuality a time share presentation. the time share people were a pain in the butt, waking me up not once but twice with phone calls wanting to schedule us in for a presentation, which they professed to be only one hour but of course, as we heard from other guests, was more like two or more hours. we chose not to rent a car and when I asked guest services to call us a cab she called an unlicensed driver who charged us $20 round trip to go to Walmart which we discovered too late was only a few blocks away. A few days later I asked the lady behind the reception desk to call a Checker cab specifically, she called the same person who had overcharged us before. I was NOT impressed. she said she didn't have the number for checker cabs (the largest cab company in Orlando). I went back to our room and looked up the number in the phone book and called them myself. The shuttle drivers were very pleasant but there is a lack of communication between the Front desk and the drivers. Twice we confirmed our seats on the shuttle with Front desk but were not on the list when it came time to board the shuttle. one of these times was at 9 pm from the Magical Kingdom, luckily there was room available or we would have been stuck paying a taxi to get back to the hotel (probably a $40 cab ride).

If you are a person who gets down on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass looking for a mark or a bit of peeling paint, then you will be writing a scathing criticism and to you I would say stay away and get a hobby in your life.

Yes the place is a bit dated looking, and yes the paint might be peeling here and there and yes its not immaculate on the inside, but at the end of a long day enjoying myself in the parks and beaches I was able to come home to a quiet oasis which was cleaned sufficiently to normal standards and it was comfortable and quiet. Just what the doctor ordered. We had two floors, 2 toilets, a walk in wardrobe, a huge bathroom, a dining room, a lounge, a kitchen with a cooker, a microwave, a fridge, a dishwasher, and an icemaker. A laundry room with a washing machine and a tumble dryer so we had no dirty clothes to deal with when we got home. 2 televisions and a video player.

The same could be said for the resort itself, its very lush and has a lot of greenery and shrubery around its grounds-its a hidden gem a nice little get away from the hustle and bustle of busy orlando. and there is a lot of nature to be seen, we had armadilos living just outside our room, they were so cute! The pool area was a great place to relax after a long day at the parks (disney was 10-15 minute drive and Universal and seaworld etc about 20-25 minute drive) as it was open until 1am. They also play movies besides the pool every thursday and saturday (i think) with free popcorn. How great is that?!? The staff at this resort are out of this world, nothing was too much trouble! The reception staff always had a smile and a 'have a great day' and the bar staff at the tiki bar by the pool were just as friendly. The housekeeping staff always left our room clean and tidy, making our beds everyday, hoovering every other day, replacing our towels and even putting our dish washer on! We never had any problems with this resort. The only negative comment i would have to make is that if you get a call asking you do you want to attend a free breakfast/lunch say no!! Its a scam...time share meeting for over an hour on the plus side we did recieve $200 pre paid visa card for attending. My boyfriend and I are returning back to florida in June 2010 and we are going to try to return back to Oak Plantations and it will be a definate contender for our future visits to florida.

The pictures online looked great and it was within our budget. We requested a condo with a balcony so the two adults could use it while our two children slept in the evening. We did read some negative reviews posted here and figured they were probably posted by picky people with too-high standards so we booked anyway. Upon arrival, we were told we had the balcony we requested and were staying in Villa #6. To our dismay, the condo was very far away from the pool (we actually had to walk through the parking lot to access it...remember, we had two small children in tow along with towels, etc). As well, our condo was on the back of the building (we had to walk along a dingy walkway to access it) and the amount of nature back there was unreal. I realize it's Florida, but the noise from creatures and shaking of bushes as we walked by was a little much. As well, there were cats everywhere. There was no view (unless you count a rusty fence) and it felt dark and dirty. We never used the balcony once since the wood was rotting and the chairs looked like something picked off the side of the road. It was really gross. The condo itself was ok (no stained carpet, a fully stocked kitchen and a washer/dryer unit that worked), but the physical location of it left a lot to be desired. We walked back to the registration building and asked for something closer to the pool but the lady at front did not want to move us. She said she could try to move us to another condo in a few days, but it wouldn't be as nice as the one we were currently in. After reading some of the reviews here, we figured it was better to stay put since the inside of the condo was in decent shape. We realized the next day that there was a wasp nest at the end of the railing (the cap was off and a nest was inside) and wasps constantly flew at us as we entered and left the condo everyday. We reported this but nothing was ever done. We basically crept along the stairs as our vacation went on. The pool, however, was really great. It was never crowded, it was clean and we enjoyed it (even though the water was very salty/too chlorinated). Half-way through our visit, the maid was supposed to come for a cleaning, but she never showed up. However, the last day of our stay, she knocked on our door at 10:10am and asked when we were leaving! The gate was another huge issue...our key never worked. We constantly had to honk to be let in. It was very frustrating. Overall, it was just ok: the pool was great, the inside of the condo acceptable, but the location of the condo very poor. As well, Oak Plantation is located in a seedier part of Kissimmee...it has a run-down feeling.

I have to concur. I tried to be optimistic but once I arrived, they let me down. Like another person who posted a review, we arrived early, pre-registered and requested a phone call once the room was ready. We're still waiting on that call. We stayed in an one bedroom on the back of one of the buildings that looked dark and wooded if you were returning late in the evening. We had to park around front and walk around to the back of the building.The unit was just a disappointment! It was very tiny (I was hoping to get a more spacious unit). I do have to admit that the bed was comfortable. The couch was so old that I was afraid to sit on it (eventually I did, but not before I sprayed it several times with Lysol). The refrigerator had actual rust spots on the front of it and on the floor around it. The carpet had stains in it that looked so old that it was imperative that we wore socks the entire time we were there. The shower was the real joke. I had to look around to see if I was getting punk'd once I turned it on! It was almost as if someone was just spraying me with a water hose without the sprayer on the end. They had a big wood chip sticking out of the wall (I assume to hold the shower head in place). One night I called for towels (because they only supply you with a set daily but you have to call and request it), I had to call three times before I got them. The bedroom television showed green spots on one entire side of the screen. The area isn't the greatest either, but the only upside to that is that you're about 15 minutes from Disney. And to think that they try to set you up to eat breakfast and hear the time share spill----No Thanks!!! We didn't use any of the amentities (pool, Internet cafe, etc). I got depressed daily when I thought about the return back there in the evening.

The one-bedroom apartment was on two floors and was very spacious, with an emorous amount of storage space. The lounge furniture is a little dated however it wasn't threadbare.

After the discount and a $75 coupon, our stay was only $30 a night taxes included. All in, $120 for 4 nights. I checked the reviews on here and they seemed good enough, especially with the hotel being rated 18-22 out of 220 in Kissimmee. I was reluctant of course, because some people seem to have horror stories. Being that I typically never stay in 5 star places, I don't have aspirations of paradise on earth in the hotels I choose. A hotel for me is just a place to sleep. I don't plan my vacation to be spent at the hotel. We arrived Tuesday (5/22/09) around 7 p.m. and went to the registration building. I was dreading the time share pitch, and low and behold, none was given. Asha was very nice and got us sorted quickly. We stayed in building 3 which is just 3 buildings to the left past the entrance gate and on a bottom floor. The pool was just a 100 ft walk across our building. The room was clean and the kitchenette area was clean. We chose not to get the housekeeping as it was only two of us for 4 nights. Had I not looked at the actual customer photos from here on Trip Advisor, I would have been disappointed when I didn't see a flat panel tv, smooth top range, etc. There was a 25 inch tube tv in the living room/common area with a cheapo VCR on top and a 20 inch tube tv in the bedroom. The range was a typical cheap 4 burner one, the combo washer/dryer looked in working order, and the microwave was clean and in working order. The fridge was clean and worked and there was also a dishwasher. Our kitchenette area stocked with cups, plates, utensils, pots and pans, etc. The decor was a little outdated, but I'm not there to take pictures for a magazine, so that didn't bother me much. The bathroom was clean, but again, you could tell it was old. I'm sure had I gotten on the floor and looked closely I would have seen grime or dust bunnies like others did in the nooks and crannies, but I didn't bother looking. In the bedroom there was a walk in closet with a built in safe. There were extra sheets and blanket as well. That was a really nice aspect, having the walk in closet. The first evening we stopped at the internet cafe just before closing and that was nice enough. They had a soda fountain machine and chips. We went to the pool a few times. There were two separate pools side by side and a water works type area for kids next to that with water cascading out of pipes. Next to those was a whirlpool. The pool area in general was really nice. Plenty of lounge chairs and it wasn't overly crowded. We didn't get anything from the tiki bar. My only complaint about the pool was that they need to clean it more. There was plenty of debris and bugs floating around all 3 times we went. I would suggest they clean it with a skimmer more often than when they currently do. Overall, our stay was enjoyable. At no point did I feel I made a mistake staying at Oak Plantation Resort. We used the resort as a base of operations for a few days, so we were not using the resort as the vacation spot itself. The room size was very nice and was bigger than most hotels I have stayed at before. For $30 a night, you couldn't ask for more. Unless the rooms for timeshare owners are drastically different, I wouldn't buy a timeshare there if I was ever inclined to purchase one. For that price, I would definitely stay at Oak Plantation Resort again. Pros: Room price, lots of facilities (internet cafe, general store, pool), pleasant environment (you would never know you were just a block off of the seedier part of 192), kitchenette, walk-in closet Cons: Rooms were dated, old tvs (I'm not on vacation in Orlando to watch TV though), debris in pool", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price, Great Pool\u201d", "Author": "DisFamily", "ReviewID": "UR31281110", "Content": "We had a very full week planned with Combination Disney World and SeaWorld.

Bad points: 1. room unclean - at a quick glance it looks OK but it quickly became obvious that the staff there do a quick cleaning between guests and never get to those harder to reach areas. For instance my three year old threw a monkey we got him at animal kingdom up on a high ledge. When i stood on the chair to retrieve it the amount of dust and debris there was disgusting. Under beds and behind furniture was the same. 2. Outdated - Furniture was old and the couch smelled bad, the appliances were all very old and the dishwasher did not work nor did the dryer which took three 60 min dry cycles to dry a very small load. We brought a DVD player for our child to watch cartoons but the TV there was so old it could not be connected to the DVD's audio visual connections. Each unit is not equipped with a BBQ. To BBQ you must line up to use the Charcoal BBQ. Forget about BBQ. It is easier to just go out to a restaurant for a steak. 3. Noisy - basketball courts just outside our unit. quiet hours were not enforced and the basket ball courts were used up until 1:00 am. The building was not very soundproof - background noise does not normally bother me, i have a three year old for gods sake, but the thunking of a basket ball until 1:00 am after a long day at the parks drove me crazy and then very early the next morning on a couple of occasions. You can hear everything in the attached units, people talking, snoring, etc. When my 3 year old awoke in the mornings he played as usual and was not abnormally loud yet the neighbor was so annoyed he banged his fist of the wall for what seemed like 5 minutes. I felt bad for him but what was i supposed to do. 4.Poor service - Internet cafe has only two computers and i had to wait for an hour to get access and the male staff there obviously hated his job and seemed so irritated when asked a question. When i called about the broken dishwasher they said they would repair it that day and to leave the dirty dishes in the sink for the cleaning staff. When i got back that evening the dirty dishes were not cleaned but stacked inside the broken dishwasher and no work was carried out. When i called again i spoke to the same staff and informed her that the dishwasher was not repaired. She said she thought i said i did not want it fixed. She is so full of BS! Anyway she apologized and said engineering would be over the next day. When i returned the same thing again dirty dishes piled up in the broken dishwasher. They never did come by during my visit and just ignored me. 5. I asked for a smoke free room and when i arrived the room stank with smoke and had obviously been smoked in several times. I am a smoker myself so for me to smell the smoke says to me that this room has been heavily and frequently smoked in. I heard other similar complaints from other guests as well. 6. The safe it too small to store your valuables. 7. the childrens pool was broken and the pool next to the main one was very dirty during our entire stay at the resort. 8. Resort is in an older more run down part of town. I know this can happen anywhere anytime but I went to the store just down the street shorty after dark and as i walked back to my vehicle a shady looking character quickly approached my vehicle and was wanting something i just locked my doors and left quickly but it gave me a very uneasy feeling. You don't feel as safe on this resort and in the general area as much as other resorts a little closer to the parks. 9. This resort is close to an airport because airplanes were flying very low and there landing approach was quite noisy. There is a fire station close by too because on a few different nights you could here the loud sirens. 10. There was no frying pan in the unit so i had to fry eggs in a pot and when my wife made salad we had to use the same pot since there was no salad bowel or bowl large enough for it. Bottom line is that this resort is NOT VERY NICE and is definitely not what it appears to be on the website. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. The pictures shown on the website are likely unit 10 the ONLY renovated one and not available unless you are a timeshare holder. There are too many better choices in the area to want to ever return here.

I have made several trips and enjoyed every trip. Having said that, I can not deny the fact that the place needs to be updated. Oak Plantation has gone from one company to another. In 1998, it belonged to Hampton and the place was perfect. 10 years later, the place is run down and is in desperate of management who would take the time and effort to restore the resort to the way it was. Management needs to get into each room correct or update any and all problems that need to be addressed. My last stay our room was fine. The dryer was slow to dry and that indicates clogged dryer vents. Management should be on this problem as it is fire danger. TVs and video players need to be updated. We could not play DVDs for our children because of outdated TVs and video players. Each room should have a fully stocked kitchen. Our room was, but other reviews indicate that is not the fact. We pay a lot in dues for maintainance and I feel that this should be spent in upgrades. The biggest problem I have with this new managment is that fact that we were robbed by a staff member during this last stay. We specificaly requested NO HOUSEKEEPING upon check-in. On our last full day, while our family was at the pool, a staff member entered our room without us knowing. My wife and mother had money missing from their purses when we returned. There was no possible way that the money could have been misplaced since it was their before they went to the pool and was gone when we came back. I went to the front desk to see what could be done. They read the door lock system and told us it would take a few days to get the results. We contacted the police. The police officer was able to determine that a staff member did enter our room while we were at the pool. And because we were signed up for no housekeeping, the crime went from petty theft to a felony. It has only been a few days and I know these things take some time to resolve, but I am waiting on Oak Plantation to do the right thing and cover our losses. Even though we had this bad experience with being robbed, I will go back. I don't think I can recommed this place to a friend and have the same thing happen to them as that just happened to us. I will take futher steps to protect my belongings in during future stays. Having children who love swimming, Oak Plantation is a quiet place where kids have plenty to do. You can not spend everyday at a park and resting poolside is very nice. Timeshares are always trying to get people to take tours or upgrade. I don't know if these are good deals that they offer or not. Research before sitting in on a presentation. It is simple for me, I own and have no need to upgrade or buy another timeshare. I tell them thank you but no thank you and walk away. Besides, when I bought my timeshare we got two disney tickets and two sea world tickets for FREE. Now I think they offer discount tickets. Dicker with them for free tickets, the worst they will say is no. I hope this is helpful in making your decision on staying at Oak Plantation or not. You can get robbed anywhere. The important thing is what will Oak Plantation do about it. The tollways take you towards disney and are not nearly as congested as 192.

We have stayed at several timeshare resorts in the Orlando area in the past few years and this is by far the most disappointing. I'll summarize in case you don't want to read the details: I expect a \"resort\" to be nicer than my home! Frankly, my apartment right out of high school 30+ years ago was not only nicer than our accomodations at Oak Plantation, but was more in line with today's decorating standards. A trend of most establishments is to prominently display their disclaimer that they are not responsible for theft of their guests' valuables. Oak Plantation is no exception. When I make it clear that I want no housekeeping of any kind and in fact, confirm that I want nobody to enter my unit, I expect them to stay out of my room! Now for the details: We are accustomed to the hard sell at check in to get you to the timeshare meeting. My husband said he had to get snarly but got the job done...not interested in a timeshare right now! If we were in the market, this would not be a consideration. Our upstairs unit is gloomy and depressing; the cheerful paint color didn't help, nor did the plastic flowers! Don't look forward to your garden tub or roomy walk-in shower, because you won't find them here. Don't bother bringing your DVD collection for down time, because they won't work with your VCR player! I will say that the family room is spacious. The problem is that the television is across the room and small (maybe 25\"). In the world of flat screen and/or big screen, this was a disappointment. The television in the bedroom was just as small and several stations faded in and out. The carpet is dirty and has numerous places where it is bubbled and tripping hazards. On a more positive note, there is a full-size washer and dryer in the unit. But wait...five and half hours to dry a couple of pairs of jeans and tee shirts?! Looking behind the washer and dryer put the cleanliness question to rest. It has been a longgggg time since any cleaning was done there! There are even garments mixed in with the piles of lint. Because the dryer does heat up, there is obviously a clog somewhere. Therefore, on top of the inconvenience of the length of time to dry the clothes, the clog is clearly a fire hazard. Because of the record low temperatures, we were forced to turn on the heat. The furnace is located behind a door right next to the sofa. As luck would have it, the noise and rattling from the furnace was so loud, the only way we could hear the television was to either turn it up full volume or watch the one in the bedroom with the stations that fade in and out. Based on the weather, we left our unit and headed to southern Florida for a few days. Because we weren't provided with a \"Do Not Disturb\" tag (my usual method of keeping people out of our room), I left explicit instructions at the front desk that we wanted no cleaning, trash removal or towel replinishment. I confirmed that we, in fact, wanted nobody in our unit at all throughout our stay. I purposely failed to mention we were leaving town for a few days. When we returned, I noticed a bath mat folded accordian style on the edge of the tub. Clearly someone had been in our unit. The trash, however, had not been removed. That fact, coupled with some of the dresser drawers being not quite closed led me to wonder if some \"snooping\" had occurred. I make it a point to completely close all drawers and doors and strategically place certain items so that I can instantly tell if anyone has been in our room. Fortunately, we had taken all valuables with us so snooping is our only concern. I called the front desk and spoke to a woman who was very apologetic and advised they would investigate. She was aware of my earlier request for no housekeeping and went on to say she'd check to see if housekeeping had been in our room. When I mentioned that I couldn't imagine anyone else stopping by to fold a towel accordian style and placing it on the side of the tub, she was inclined to agree. With this particular establishment, not only do they not want to be held responsible for your valuables, they do not honor your request to stay out of your room. Add to that the fact that the safe provided is a mere 12\"x8\"x6\"! That doesn't come close to holding our two iPods, two cell phones, digital camera, wallets, cash, credit cards, prescription medications, documents containing personal information, and laptop. The final straw was when I went into the bathroom this morning and a slithery bug scurried from beneath a towel laying on the countertop beside the sink! It has been too cold to enjoy the pool, but I seriously doubt that a positive experience there is going to make up for the negatives of this establishment or our stay here, nor would satisfactory rectification of our concerns change our minds about a return visit.

We are looking to eventually relocate to the Florida area and wanted to stay somewhere where we could visit the Disney area but also travel around and view different regions in Florida. We wanted to have a \"villa\" so that we could cook and have a bit more room than just a traditional hotel. I would NOT suggest this place to anyone. To be completely fair, it wasn't a horrible place to stay but it was generally run down and most of the staff didn't speak English and were not at all worried about trying to fix any problems for their customers. The villa was fairly small and smelled musty. It also had large areas of dust in it. My boyfriend cooked a really nice dinner one night and about forty minutes before eating we realized we had NO utensils. I called housekeeping and when I finished explaining what we needed (didn't understand the word \"utensils\"), they never showed up. A half hour later we called the front desk and still no silverware. We called one more time to the front desk and still no silverware. Finally, we ate with a spatula and slotted spoon for serving vegetables. After dinner we went to the manager apologized and did give us two free breakfast vouchers. The next morning we ate breakfast at the facility. Unfortunately, they had a beautiful breakfast in the sales building. Apparently breakfast is free if you listen to their two-hour sales pitch as this resort is a time share. But, with the poor facilities and service we received I can't imagine why anyone would buy anything here!! Anyway - breakfast at the other building is usually $5.99 but thank God we got it free because we would never pay for it! The coffee was the WORST I've ever tasted in my entire life and I've had some bad coffee in my day. It was that cheap liquid coffee that some institutions buy. The breakfast was processed eggs and sausage. They did have some cereal and yogurt and a few bagels but for that price, I expected something nicer. We went to their \"Internet cafe\" to print out some online tickets for Universal studios and the person running it (some guy who could care less about the customers. He was too busy talking on the phone with his friend about going out that night) was a jerk. He told us that we could use the Internet but that we were not allowed to print anything out. That was reserved only for managers. We explained that we needed to print out some online tickets. We wondered why in the world the printers were there (and filled with paper) if the customers were not allowed to use them? We finally went to the front desk and they said that even the workers at the front desk weren't allowed to use the printers. ??? We then had to drive to the local mall and find an internet place to print them out. My boyfriend asked someone at the hotel about it the next day and the girl at the front desk said \"I don't know anything. I just work here.\" And that was pretty much the sentiment of everyone who worked here. When there were problems, no one cared to help you or to make them right (maybe take money off our stay). We received no fresh towels, dishwashing detergent or clothing detergent until the third night after which we'd already bought our own by then. They kept telling us they were too busy to bring fresh towels or to get our utensils to us but we would keep seeing staff driving around on their little golf carts and talking to eachother so this was incredibly upsetting to us. Anyway - I do not like to say anything negative about where I've stayed but my boyfriend and I don't have a lot of money and were really looking forward to this vacation and it upset me that we wasted our money on a place that was not only dirty and poorly managed, but that also did not care about their customers.

About a dozen people were already milling about in the lobby, all waiting for their rooms, too. And it got worse. The first woman I talked to said check in was at 4, but maybe they could get me in, it would take about 20 minutes. So after 30 minutes I went to the desk and she had left for the day. Another woman promised to help, just give her 10-15 minutes, and that turned into 25 minutes. Third woman said to give her 5 minutes which was actually another 15. Finally got a room key after 4 pm. Went out to move my car and another person I had seen earlier said \"were you waiting all that time? we went to eat. Wow!\" This is some kind of either timeshare place or owners put their places into a rental program. Not sure which, but they are basically condo units. We had a downstairs 1 BR for $75 a night before taxes. There were no other fees, but I had a big blow up when the front desk wanted a $50 deposit for the room, this was after prepaying for the first night, with a 3 day cancellation policy. When I inquired what the deposit was for, the clerk said \"in case you buy anything while you're here, like the bar or restaurant.\" I said I wouldn't have time for any of that, but she insisted the deposit was mandatory. Then a big group was trying to check in and they heard about the deposit, they had 22 rooms, so they were going ballistic. It was quite a scene. But as I say, after check in, all was ok. And they did void out the deposit and give me a reciept when I left. The unit itself was clean, fresh, modern, and in very good condition.

Then you find out they do a wonderful job of creative writing. Not to mention what they don\u2019t put in the descriptions. The resort resembles an apartment complex from the 1980\u2019s. The mileage on the interiors and exteriors is very high. Someone has tried to keep up with the repairs but the quality is poor. Many things were mostly jerry rigged to keep the unit in operation. No Non Smoking rooms available (ever). We had to, and others we spoke too staying there, did as many outside activities as possible. We went through a large can of Lysol and have to wash everything when we came home. The rooms felt dirty because of the chain smoke residue you got from touching anything. We spent the first hour wiping down everything to find that our cleaning towel was black from dirt and smoke. They sent in housekeeping and maintenance to deodorize the room but you can\u2019t remove what is imbedded in the walls, ceilings and fabrics. We had our infant son with us who could never be let to crawl on the floor and socks were worn by all when in the room The light switch in the bathroom was repaired by a handyman with the wrong part. It had to be jiggled to keep on and will be the source of an injury or fire one day. The same quality repair work is everywhere around the pool and in the common areas. Watch out for the open wires on the drinking water fountain by the pool too. The TV in the bedroom got every other channel unless you held the cable in the back. Don\u2019t touch the dresser or you loose the picture. The wheel falls of the dishwasher rack every time you pull it out ant the freezer will eventually freeze in two days of you set it on high. The washer and dryer are nice to have. It takes a while for anything to dry and you still go home with the ashtray smell in anything you clean. Leaf blowing begins at 8 am daily followed by mowing. Once the yard work has you up, don\u2019t plan on a nap as they don\u2019t mention that the complex is split by the flight path of the executive airport. Mostly prop planes but a good 5 to 10 jets landing every hour until dusk. Once the runway slows down they run several gas powered golf cards every 30 min or so all night long. After saying something about the noise, they stopped running from midnight to about 6:30 Interactive children pool = old fountains with broken parts. Most were broke or welded to stay on permanently. I did get one control to work but it then filled the kiddy pool with a brown rusty sludge. Watch the sharp edges on either gate as you go to the pool. A DIY repair job has been done multiple times on them leaving it dirty and sharp to the touch. Climate controlled lagoon pools= two side by side pools in the shade of the trees. The kid did not mind the cool temperature of the pool but the adults avoided the one in the shade. The list goes on from mold on flooring to cabinets chewed on by house pet or designating from the many years of use.

They called us a half hour before the regular check-in time! We arrived at our unit, and when I walked in the door, I was fascinated at how much we were getting for such a cheap rate. There was a kitchen, dining table, living room, dishwasher, refrigerator, washer/dryer, vacuum! Then I went to look out our window, and noticed a fly in the blinds. And then another, and another! These were INSIDE!! Then I noticed there were some dead ones laying on the floor. I walked around the place and found a few more in the bedroom, some dead, some alive. And another in the bathroom. Disgusted, I called the front desk to tell them our situation and hoped they would give us a new room. She questioned me asking what kind of flies they were as if I was some sort of fly expert. I told her they were fairly big ones. and she went on to tell me that there are no flies in Florida. Well I don't think I'm imagining them! She sent over Maintenance, who brought a can of Roach & Ant spray. He nonchalantly sprayed at the flies in the window and told us that they would slowly die. I was so disgusted afterward. We didn't even want to sleep under the sheets because of fear of bed bugs. The flies didn't reappear afterward, but we did notice some flies stuck between the window and the netting of the window on the outside. GROSS! It was good that it was only a one-night stay.

This was our second visit to Florida in as many years and our previous accomodation had been fanatastic but unavailable when we were booking the second trip.

On arrival we quickly realised that all our worries were for nothing. The resort, although not perfect is extremely friendly and homely. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment which was spacious and had all required amenities. Location is perfect for shopping and theme parks. The swimming pool is gorgeous and stays open until 1am - just what you need after a long, hot day with Mickey and friends. My only complaint came on our final day. Check out time in the resort is 10am and our flight did not depart until 6pm. We asked at reception to see if there was any way we could keep our room for a couple of hours or even get a room in which to shower after a couple of hours at the pool. Unfortunately there was nothing they could do for us other than to tell us they would store our luggage and that there was a shower in the pool area (a cold, outdoor shower used to rinse off before entering the pool.) We accepted this but thought that they might be a bit lenient with the check out time as they had appeared to have an overall laid back attitude. The morning of departure came and the first phone call was at 9.40am to remind of the us check out time. This was closely followed by the arrival of one of the cleaners who then sat down outside the door waiting for us to leave. At 10.10am we got another phone call to remind us to check out.

We have always advised all of our friends to stay here, as the experience has always been wonderful. We requested the same villa as last year as it is right next to the little store that they have on site. We were very pleased when they honored our request and we checked into the same villa. When we opened the door to the villa, we were struck with a very musty smell and very dirty looking carpeting. Upon reaching the upstairs to the unit the smell only got worse. When turning on lights through the villa, almost all the switches were dirty with finger smudges. The bathroom looked as if someone gave it a very quick once over, but there was hair behind the toilet and door. Prior to my family unpacking, we went down to Walmart and I bought bleach spray and cleaned the villa myself. I was very leery of letting my two girls walk around barefoot as the carpeting really was that bad. The girls slept on the pull out sleeper sofa and the bedding for it was torn. Note - If you stay here, make sure you wash all of the dishware prior to using it as it does not look like they are washed between guests, by the house keeping staff. There is no way to know if your version of washing dishes is the same as the guest before you. The grounds are very nice and we very much enjoy the location, but the resort is a sister property to an Oak Plantation Hotel which is located out front. There is a connection walkway between the two places where people staying at the Hotel can come to the Resort and enjoy the pools and grounds. There were many nights that the girls wanted to enjoy the pools at 10pm at night, but it was often busy with the people coming over from the Hotel. One of the attraction for us at the Oak Plantation has always been that it is a smaller property and you usually do not feel crowded. I would have to say that my opinion on this has now changed. We paid $50.00 a night through Expedia, which is a very good rate. Even though the price was great, I am very sure that this was our last stay at Oak Plantation.

The staff even let me know that for a few hours not all services may be available. This was due to the company holiday party going on that night. Completely understandable! The grounds make it feel like you are in a secluded area. Lots of shade trees and pleasant look. The neighborhood is not as bad as some describe, but probably not the best. Never was I worried about this. Wal-Mart about a quarter of a mile away. Great for needed supplies! The outside of the building was in very good shape. (we reserved the two bedroom villa) When we entered, the first very obvious thing was a musty smell and filthy carpet!! We took our 2 year old's sandals off and that was a mistake. Her feet were black within 2 minutes...no exaggeration!! I wish we had taken before and after pictures of feet from walking on the carpet. The dishwasher was outdated and the bottom portion exterior was rusted and falling off. The bottom half of the fridge had rust spots covering it. A little touch up paint would have taken care of this ugly sight. The cabinets are outdated- original color was wood grain. Then they obviously tried to update it with new doors. However, white doors on a dark wood base looks very old and tacky. There were several unremoveable stains on the countertops. With the exception of the carpet, the overall condition was acceptable. I have seen the complaints about the flooring prior to staying there and they obviously have not corrected this issue. I would really hope that they would not rent this unit to anyone else before carpet replacement. It was that bad!! We would have asked for a new unit, but we arrived pretty late. The last thing we felt like doing was messing with that. The kids loved the place despite what we noticed. After unloading the truck, I took the kids to the pool. A big plus was that the pool was open until 1 a.m. and the Tiki Bar until 10:30 p.m. The kids had a great time at the pool. The whole area was very clean and had towels available even after hours. The jacuzzi is huge with powerful jets! One pool is heated and the other is not. (kids swam in both regardless) There is even a neat little kid's area that they enjoyed. When we returned from the pool it was very late and the kids were ready for bed. I pulled out the sofa bed to find that there were no sheets or pillows available for it. I would condider this a complaint if it weren't for the extremely helpful staff. Housekeeping was off for the night, but the maintenance person was just returning from the company party. He went to some extra trouble of finding bedding for us immediately. Very friendly!! (also any staff that was driving by our vehicle were constantly offering to lend a hand) We opted not to pay the extra $25/day for housekeeping, so cleaning was on us. If you plan on cooking, bring some non-stick pans. Their pans are not and the kitchen is not equipped with scrub sponges. I found myself a bit rushed to make the 10 a.m. check-out time. Even another hour would be nice. The check-out staff was very courteous and asked how the stay was. It was then that I told them about the carpet and dishwasher issue. He was very apologetic and ensured me it would be noted. Taking a look back as a whole, we would probably only stay here again if it were going to be for at least a week where we needed to use the kitchen and have the extra space. Next time for a couple days stay, we will just get 2 rooms somewhere else for the same price. Other rooms for a cheaper price have been in better shape. Keep in mind that I have listed mostly the negative points that we noticed. There were plenty of positives to go along with this experience. If you have lots of kids like we do, you will want the space!! There was no fine print with hidden cleaning charges or anything at this place! Still overall pleased with the property and would give it a recommendation if you are not looking for 4-star accomodations!

If you are looking for somewhere that is not in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the tourist area, but not far from the parks and the tourist \"strip\" down Route 192, close to I-4 - this is a great location. The unit we stayed in was a 2 bedroom (King sized bed in the master and 2 full beds in the 2nd bedroom and 2 bathrooms in the unit. It was very spacious and clean. The kitchen was not the greatest - a bit small, stove seemed to be old but worked. Anything we needed that was not in the unit, the front desk staff was more than accomodating and we received our requested items within minutes. Our unit had a laundry room with a full size washer and dryer which I absolutely loved and the master bedroom had a huge walk-in closet - very nice!! The landscaping on the property is beautiful - small pond with fountains right outside our unit - ducks, cranes, fish, turtles, etc. They also have music that plays around the pond - not loud enough for you to hear unless you were outside. Nice tennis courts - a few outside charcoal grills, small store. The pool and hot-tub area is very nice - a little bar that serves some food, bartender Carolyn - extremely nice!! We did the timeshare presentation to receive a discount on Epcot tickets - the salespeople have to try to sell the timeshare - that is their job and how they make a living. I have to say, this is the first time I have ever been to one of the presentations, but the salesperson that we had, did not pressure us one bit nor did the sales manager. The staff at this resort is top-notch - extremely nice, professional and worked hard to make sure we were satisfied. If you are looking for a five star location - this probably is not for you.

So, if your staying here do get directions yourself first. Check in was quick, a guy at reception sat me down and started giving me the hard sell about all the tickets they could provide etc..... my kids were running riot, i was knackered so i politely told him thanks but no thanks. Asked for a lower villa since my daughter was 2, was given a top floor villa. However, i did actually come to relise that i would much prefer a top floor villa for the light, views and noise. The villa itself is simply a one bedroom masionette. With an open plan kitchen/dining room it is not spectacular. But who goes to Orlando to sit in a room! It was more than we needed and absolutley fine. There is a walmart about 1/4 mile down the road so we stocked up on juice, cereals etc and used the frdige. Whilst there not a single item went missing, any problem i had was instantly sorted, the place was clean, tidy and generally a really pleasent place. The Spa is red hot but it is strategically placed so your kids can play in the childrens pool whilst you sit and relax. When i was there the pool bar kept giving me 2 drinks everytime i bought 1. I started to think she was trying to get me drunk so she could join me in the spa..... No, it was 2 for 1 until 9pm or something.

Oh, dont use the telephone, a 1 minute call to UK cost me $45, if it rings and they dont answer they will still skin you $20. Take a hoard of $1 bills. Orlando is like Toll city, you cant breathe without the highway charging you a dollar for the privilidge.

Admittedly, it was the promise of discount Universal Studios tickets after 90 minutes that we originally went for. However, the site won us over and we bought 2 weeks a year in one of the the bigger apartments. And as a gesture of goodwill, they moved us into their (then) just opened motel that very night, for the remainder of our holiday! The motel is fabulous, we got two double rooms, and they were huge. The beds are massive and the kitchenette provided everything we needed, including a fridge and microwave. The rooms each had a lounge area with fold up sofa beds. The bathrooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. In fact, the whole place is beautifully decorated, and the furniture is luxurious, none of the economy rubbish from our original motel! During our stay, we were welcome to use all of the resort's amenities. We came back for our first proper holiday as owners in July 07, this time in our beautiful first floor apartment.

Again, tastefully and luxuriously decorated in a modern style. There are two pools which we made full use of, an internet cafe which is free of charge (three computers, two unlimited, and one with a net nanny for children) and works on half hour slots. There is usually a 15 minute wait for a machine at most, and if it's a quiet period, you're free to stay on the net until someone comes in and require a machine. The room is also used for kid's activities and has a complimentary drinks machine and a large, well stocked basket of complimentary chips (crisps!!!) There are always activities on, every single day. Stand out ones during our stays were the poolside movie on a 17 foot screen (take mosquito repellant!) which was free, bingo with all-you-can-eat pizza (also free, and boy were they generous with the amounts of pizza, needless to say, we didn't go hungry that night!) and the Tiki bar luau. There is a convenience shop on site, and the afore mentioned laundrette. We were right opposite a walmart which helped immensely too!

That same evening I asked to be moved to an upstairs apartment and was told they had no more rooms available. The room was very dated. The sofa bed was an old green faded couch where the cushions didn't fit. One lousy plaid chair. A VCR not a DVD player. Green faded placemats with the same type napkins. The appliances were unbelievable.....VERY OLD oven with the oven heating coils hanging down.. and the stove top coils were crooked. The washer and dryer are dated and the dryer does not dry. The pillows.....FLAT. Each and every one of them. Both remotes for the TVs have no backs. Dishwasher is very dated. The filter to the vent was JUST FILTHY. Thick with dirt and dust. I could not stay there. I simply did not feel safe there. The apartment was in a corner of the resort and away from the pool area. The apartments in the pool area are nice but only for owners. There are two pools. One was constantly dirty with bugs, hair, sticks and leaves. The sprinklers in the kids area were not woking. The larger pool was clean and heated. We brought the kids over to use the clean pool since it was larger that the one at the place we decided to stay at the last minute. The pool area has a nice lay out. The tiki bar looked ok. The bartender Carlos was very pleasant. This resort is located near a small airport and every eight mins a loud noisy plane would pass over the pool area at low altitude. It was eight of us and six of us decided to move to another resort. My son and his girlfriend decided to stay since we had put the money out. He vowed never again. Of course the package required for me to attend a timeshare presentation . I was slapped in the face again when they showed me the rooms that are for the timeshare owners at this resort. BEAUTIFUL, marble counter tops, plasma tvs, modern furniture and appliances, jacuzzi tubs and master bedrooms. I asked why I was not offered a room like that so that I could be encouraged to buy and was told I was a renter and renters do not get that option to stay in those rooms. I even took the timeshare guy over to our apartment (1101) and showed him the place. His answer was he does not work for the resort he works for Interval International timeshare. I flat out refused to purchase at this resort or spend any night at this resort. So if you are a renter...BEWARE of vacationing at prime time. I think as an exchanger you might have a chance of a nice room in the off season. Renters BEWARE. The oak plantation resort and The inn at oak plantation are two different places. The inn at oak plantation is a road side motel that was probably bought by oak plantation resort, painted and remodeled with modern furniture and appliances. The resort is more like a villa setting. The motel is set off from the resort on a main street and requires for you to walk around the back through a path to the resort to use their pool. What a waste. Lucky for me I encountered a wyndham vaction kiosk at the mall and attended a timeshare presentation with them.............5 STAR ALL THE WAY.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cNot as clean or neat as portrayed.

The sofa and chair had crunchy food spots on them and we covered them with sheets so the children could sit on them. The maid service was excellent even with them missing one day of service. The walls and cabinets were freshly painted and looked very nice but the carpet was really old and dirty. We just kept our eyes off of the carpet! The rooms and closets were very spacious. The thermostat had no numbers or words on it (old) so we had to have someone come up to show us how to work it. They did come very quickly. The appliances and cookware were newer. The washer and dryer are in one single appliance and it took 24 hours to dry anything. They first time we used it, It leaked all over the floor but it was fixed within an hour. We ended up going down to the laudry room which was very nice and convenient. The internet went out while I was in the Internet Cafe but the attendant had it fixed immediately. They offer a free drink and quality snack while using the Internet Cafe and the kids loved that. The pool area is nice and so are the drinks at the tiki bar. It was never crowded. One of the three pools was extremely dirty and it seemed to stay that way. Front desk service was friendly but the salesman was annoying. It is very close to the Parks and tons of restuarants.

I'm guessing it's because of the different types of areas. In my opinion it is not worth the price listed on their website but is worth the price listed on Orbitz.

It's a little farther from some of the attractions of Orlando than some of the other places - including my home resort which is a Westgate Property, but Oak Plantation is absoluty great. It's nestled in an \"Oak Plantation\" - no surprise there and when we went we had taken a \"red-eye\" from Seattle so we got there early and really had no expectations about checking in early. But the staff was VERY helpful and although they couldnt' get us in immediately they referred us to breakfast and got us in early anyway. The resort is very close to a great boulevard that has everything you could ever want from shopping to eateries to even entertainment. If you like Mexican food please please try out Frontera - it's SO GOOD. I've been there twice and the food is absolutely excellent. It's a great value and the pools and hot tubs etc. and location are all good. My only warnings on this one are that it DOES take a little figuring as far as how to get to Disney and Universal and stuff - but when we stayed there - the main freeway was under construction and I think that had alot to do with it. Orlando / Kissimee - I love it but I find it hard to get around. Oak Plantation is not a five star or anything .. it has no eateries etc. but there's no need for them because its all blocks away. If anyone want's to know my two biggest beefs about this place, and they are minor because in the grand scheme of things they did NOT impinge on the WONDERFUL time I had there but #1 if you get a two bedroom and you plan to have anyone sleeping on the fold out in the living room - they will not have a bathroom accessible in the night without going into one of the bedrooms. I slept in the living room on the fold out which was actually very comfortable but in the night if I had to \"GO\" I had to slink through someone's bedroom and the other thing ... this is SO MINOR to me ... but the ferrel cats were an issue for me. I am allergic and because of that I absolutely HATE CATS and I did not enjoy the fact that it smelled like cat pee outside our unit and there were ferrel cats roaming about.

This isn't related to the resort but Georgia and Florida is being besieged currently by these little black bugs that are mating and fly around attached to each other.

A fire station is just outside the gate so we heard sirens quite frequently. My main problem was the distance to Disney, Universal, and Sea World. Though it is short in miles it can take a LONG time if you use the most direct looking route (Hwy 192). Use the Oceola Parkway ($1.50 toll each way each time) and you save a LOT of time, but it adds up.

Needless to say my stomach was in knots the whole time before the vacation thinking I was taking my entire family to some fleabag hotel in a seedy part of town...boy was I ever surprised and delightfully so!!! :) This part of town was nice, VERY accessible to ALL attractions that interested us. The resort itself was clean, pretty and cheerful. I am sooooo glad we stood here; we had a wonderful room - a second floor - 2 bedroom with a full laundry & kitchen (room # 402 I think). We all fit quite comfortably and the room was SPOTLESS. Now, I must say that I am quite a stickler when it comes to room cleanliness and I was very satisfied with each room. Everything seemed very clean - rug, furniture, beds (and sofa bed), kitchen, bathrooms, cabinets, frig, microwave. I know this because I checked it all even the grout on the tile in the corner behind the bathroom door....dust and grime free. When we left the room to go to the parks we got to Disney, SeaWorld, Downtown Disney and Epcot in 20 minutes flat. No traffic, no hassles, the route was simple, very direct and well marked. Other trips we took were to the airport, Kennedy Space Center (awesome!) and Ft. Lauderdale and we found the major highways quite easily. The resort itself was very nice and so was the staff at the front desk. We did not do the tour thing and were only called once to participate. Once we said no the first day...\"Aziz\" did not interrupt our trip our hound us for anything. We hung around the resort for one day of \"rest\" and their pool/lake area was super nice. Nothing gigantic like some of the other places we've stayed at but it was perfectly arranged. There were plenty staff around to give us towels. There were lots of chairs and tables to hang out at. The Jacuzzi gazebo was large and relaxing. The restrooms were clean and well stocked around the pool area. They offer a lot of activities which we did not have time to participate in but it was nice to know you had plenty of alternatives to the big parks should you care to stay in the resort a couple of days. My husband and father went to the general store on the premises for coffee daily. Overall we had a wonderful time. We would not hesitate booking there again in the future. My only negative comment is that the shower heads in the baths create a terrible hard spray that was annoying. Each time I showered I felt like Meryl Streep being hosed down in 'Silkwood'...other than that it's a great place to stay with your family.

The rooms are not all completely pristine and newly furnished, but the three units we have rented have all been clean and completely acceptable.

For a small family, especially if they want to save a little money by making some of their own meals, this set-up is perfect. The property is kept in wonderful shape. The people at the resort, including the groundskeepers have always been friendly and helpful. Everyone says \"hello\". The swimming pools, the hot tub, and the childens water play area are very nice. At night, my son and I play basketball (sometimes with other families) in the lighted court. We love to play tennis, which is also lit for nighttime play. All the sporting equipment is cheerfully available at the front desk. They also have a general store which is open long hours. It has most things you might need (including the morning paper and hot Starbucks coffee!!) and the prices are quite reasonable. They will even make you breakfast or lunch there. There are also outside bbq areas for each unit. I travel quite a bit for pleasure and always read the reviews here on tripadivsor before staying anywhere. When I read negative reviews about Oak Plantation, I am astounded. I can only scratch my head and wonder, \"what were these people expecting?\" This is a clean, well kept resort with lots of nice, family-friendly features, conveniently located at a reasonable price. Not once in three weeks of staying here has anyone ever been rude or unhelpful. Bottom line folks?? If you're looking for 5-star accomodations with a conscierge, gourmet restaurants and chocolate on your pillow every night, stay at the Ritz Carleton--or better yet, book a cruise. But if you're looking for a clean, family oriented, friendly and relaxing environment at a price most folks can easily afford, this place is all of that.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC Canada", "Title": "\u201cJust Average - Nothing Special\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4579042", "Content": "We stayed at the Oak Plantation Resort for 6 days in February 2006.

They have 2 treadmills, and some universal type weights. No elliptical, exercise bike or anything else. Only 1 of the treadmills worked during our stay. The other had a ripped belt and wasnt repaired. It is about 20 - 30 minutes from Disney, and a long way from Universal. The shuttle service is useless, as it leaves first thing in the morning, and doesnt return until around 10pm. You need a car if you stay here. Great pool. Didnt try anything from the tiki bar. The staff was totally clueless. I dont think we ever got an answer to any questions we asked. I don't want to be too hard on the place, because I didnt pay much too stay here, and since we spent most of our days in Disney, it was okay as a base, and as a cheap place to crash after the parks.

I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews here, but we were completely satisfied with our accomodations. The check-in was the fastest and most effecient we have ever experienced. After check-in, we were asked to sit down with their \"vacation specialist\" to discuss our vacation plans, in case we needed any discount tickets or information (we already had all that) and he briefly touched on the issue of \"the complementary breakfast that only lasted about an hour\". We refused the offer, he tried one more time, and after our second refusal, we took our welcome packets and proceeded to our unit. We were in Room 1505, on the ground floor --a very nice location. We had requested a second-floor unit, because I had read that the first floor units were noisey. We were never bothered by noise from upstairs units or anywhere. (Granted, this is not a busy time of year to be there.)I had read that someone had a problem with ants in their unit, so I took a small can of ant spray, just in case. We never saw a \"pest\" of any kind during our stay. Our unit was immaculate. We were not supposed to have housecleaning, but we discovered that, somewhere in our reservations, that was included (at no extra charge.) If I had any \"complaints\", I would only say that the resort is obviously an older resort. The bathroom was a good example -- the older style tub with 4-inch white ceramic tile walls and a vinyl shower curtain. The water pressure was incredible, if that is important to anyone. (we appreciated it!) The in-room washer was a unique feature, in that it is a washer/dryer all-in-one, no bigger than a dish washer. We had to have it repaired while we were there. The service was quick, and the servicemen were very congenial. They also have a laundry facility with full-size washers and dryers that are complimentary to resort guests. My only other complaint could be overlooked if you have a sense of humor. We never knew from one day to the next whether we would have a full set of towels, or none at all. We always had 4 bath towels (but they were small -- I missed my BIG towels!!) But, some days, we might only get one clean wash cloth and 4 or 5 handtowels, or vice versa. Regardless, if we needed anything, it was only a phone call away. They did replenish the paper products, and gave us disposable dish cloths as well as automatic dishwashing soap packets. The unit was a nice size for the two of us. (my husband and myself). The kitchen area was small, and there were limited utensils, but, it's fine for a short period of time. They have a nice variety of \"organized\" things to do at the resort, especially if you have children and you choose to spend much of your time at the resort. Most of the activities or crafts are free or very low-cost. The only activity we participated in was the Friday night luau. Usually, we avoid \"uncertain events\" such as this, but, even though there was no extra charge, we figured we had paid for it (as part of our resort cost)so we decided to check it out. They had a nice assortment of food -- wings, meatballs, cocktail sausages, ham, ribs, chicken nuggets, rolls, and tropical fruit for dessert. If the weather is good, you could sit at a table around the pool, but it was rather breezy and a little cool, so we filled our plates, and took the food back to our unit. Construction was continuing on Rt. 192, so the roads were a little trecherous. But, the location of the resort is good. There are 2 Super Wal-Marts close by, and a Super Target fairly close as well, if you need grocery items. Several years ago, we were fortunate enough to stay at Marriott's Cypress Harbour Resort, thanks to some friends who own a week there. We tend to use that as our \"barometer\" for the places we stay, and we like to say that resorts like Oak Plantation are Cypress Harbour \"wannabe's\". We doubt we will ever stay in a place as nice as Cypress Harbour again.

I have never attended or felt pressured to attend a breakfast for timesharing. As far as ants in any of the rooms goes, being a 'Northerner' who has lived in the south, the simple solution is to turn on the AC. Ants look for moisture and the ac dries the air out, forcing them to vacate. Oh, never had a problem with ants by the way. And as for others saying there are \"narrow stairs\"? I have always requested rooms on the second floor and I have yet to find these narrow stairs. Of course I am only 180 pounds. Finally, about the area really going downhill, I lived in Orlando for a while, and really the entire city is changing.

OK I will start off by saying we have stayed at Oak Plantation 4 times in the past 7 years. Our first 2 trips: Staff was FANTASTIC, pool really nice and fun for the kiddies. Down sides of those stays were that the stairs were very steep and narrow - a child attempting to climb the star gate (if you request one) could be SERIOUSLY injured. Traffic along the main drag can be bad - taking up tp 45 minutes to reach the Disney parks. Having said all of that the value and ammeneties were great. 3rd trip: We knew to book first floor accomodation because of the stair issue for the children. Traffic in the area getting worse - entire area seemed to be going downhill. We still thought it was a great value. Interactive childrens pool was about 50% functional. Staff was still fantastic. 4th trip: Great prices brought us back again... The area has gone down EVEN MORE. I kid you not there were \"female solicitors\" at the local Walmart! Our first room backed up to the woods - on the second day into our vacation - upon returning from a long day at the parks we were entering our apartment (door in the rear). There were some \"male youths\" walking along a footpath in the woods on the property directly behind the \"gated\" resort grounds that thought it would be fun to scare us. Something hit the outside light next to my husbands head and shattered it. Upon entering the room (with two terrifed little girls that had been happily dreaming of Mickey as they were being carried from the car until then) we heard laughing and shouting. We called the front desk and told them of the situation and asked to be moved - staff was very accomodating. This was at around 1am so we only brought enough things for 1 night and my husband would return in the morning for the rest. The new apartment had ALOT of ants - but I liked them better than the previous nights company. When my husband returned the next morning for the rest of our gear he saw that the large dining area window was broken. We are guessing our \"guests\" returned for more fun later that night after we had moved. We tried to book accomodation elsewhere but there was no availability with the kind of amenities we needed with our small children on such short notice - Our 2nd room was right by the basketball courts so we were in a central and better lit location - but teenagers playing late at night were loud. We were not charged for our stay - the staff really did go out of there way for us - but nothing can fix a trip after somethign like that happens. PS that trip the childrens interactive pool was not operational at all. We understand none of our troubles were the fault of Oak Plantaion - nor could it been prevented by them (except for the ants and childrens interactive pool).

Because we have a five year old we wanted a condo type unit somewhat away from the Disney hustle and bustle. We also wanted something smaller than a high rise mega resort, so this fit the bill perfectly. Directions given by a Tripadvisor reviewer were helpful and accurate, however there was not a Super Walmart nearby as previously posted, but Publix was only a short drive away for grocerys. Check in - We arrived at 3:00 pm and room was not ready so we shopped for food and returned at 4:30. After check in we were sent to the \"VIP\" desk for our parking pass. This turned out to be a rather slick way of trying to get you to attend the 2 hour time share presentation. The lure was some slightly discounted Disney tickets which we declined. The Room - We inquired about the different sizes of room and were told that our was the smallest type unit and no others were available. We had requested a second floor room which ended out to be a good choice because it did have vaulted ceilings in the living area which made the unit seem larger, also lower units had bedrooms with large windows in front of the walking paths, so you would have had to keep the blinds closed for privacy. Our unit was in building 5 facing a lovely pond and fountain. Many units faced parking lots so we were happy with our location. The kitchen was well stocked but there must have been some glitches during construction because there were no drawers at all and the silverware and utensils were in a closet. Where the drawers should have been there was the oddest washer dryer combo that I have ever encountered (more about that later). Overall the decor was tasteful, but a little worn. The color scheme was nice and there was a seperate living room with couch, armchair and TV. The bathroom was small with a white tile floor which showed lots of hair - not ours. This was an omen of housekeeping to come! House Keeping - After returning from a long day at Disney around 5:00 pm, we found the room untouched. EEEK! I immediately called the front desk and someone came within 20 minutes. Day 2, after a nice day at Cocoa Beach we returned at 4:00 pm to find the room untouched. EEEK! This time we had no clean towels or toilet paper (only one roll is provided and our 5 year old uses more than his share). After calling the front desk I was told that they had no control over housekeeping as it was a different department. The phone directory gave a number for housekeeping which put you through to the -front desk. After 3 more calls I was told that housekeeping had until 5:30 to service rooms, and if I wanted anything earlier it had to be arranged by special request. The Grounds and Pool - Fabulous! This made up for any shortcomings mentioned above. Soft music piped in, three great pools, a large hot tub, plenty of chairs and tables. The pond was beautiful, lots of interesting water fowl with baby chicks. The exteriors of the buildings were quite nice and well maintained. It really is surrounded by oak trees and had a peaceful and quiet atmosphere. However every afternoon, families of locals appeared at the pool and stayed until close to dark. This wasn't really a problem, but our feelings are that guests only should use the pool. The Washer/Dryer - we packed as little as possible for this trip, so the washer was crucial. It was a combo that washed , spun and dried the clothes all in one tub. After reading the directions I was surprised to see that the shortest cycle took 3 hours! After finishing the first load it was close to 9:00 pm. I opened it up and the clothes were still damp, after trying to restart the dryer, I found that drying only was not an option - the 3 hour cycle had started again and the tub was filling with water! We needed that laundry, so I was up for most of the night getting it done, The clothes never did dry completely, so I draped them around the living room until morning. (There is a complimentary washer, etc in community room, but at that time of night I didn't feel like going out). Overall, inspite of some minor annoyances, we really liked this place.

It was the jewel in my trip. The resort is made up of multiple buildings containing 1-2 bedroom condos and is your home away from home.

It costs is no more than a small Hotel room that contains a bedroom and bath. It is located about 8 miles from the south entrance to Disney World. This place is excellent if you don\u2019t plan to spend all of your time at Disney because you are far enough away not to be in the traffic flow of the theme parks. You are one block from the major southern artery to the theme parks \u2013 US-192. They have information about all of the attractions and tourist sites for the Orlando area either in the lobby or Guest Services. Guest Services can obtain discounted tickets for the parks. This is a very well run facility. The resort is a \u201cgated community\u201d and you need to swipe your room card to enter the parking lot. They will maintain your privacy.

It is located around the corner, west of the hotel on US-192 - Ribs \u2013 Tony Roma\u2019s has the best ribs that I\u2019ve tasted. It is about a mile or less east of hotel on US-192. - Crackle Barrel \u2013 for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner. Located a bit farther west, in the US-192 corridor west of SR-535. Crackle Barrel is closer to Disney. This place was great for a late night dinner after Disney closes at 9PM. - Denny\u2019s, IHOP, Waffle House, Pondorasa Steakhouse, Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, and other chains are all located east and west on US-192 Having a restaurant on the premises was not a problem, since hotel restaurants are normally expensive.

The kitchen table and chairs had crumbs on them from the prevoius guests, the dryer took three turns to dry two pairs of shorts, the air conditioning was extremely loud and you could hear it all night. The unit beside us was being renovated due to a water damage to the ceiling so we were unsure if that would have affected our adjacent unit (no one spoke english). Our bathroom flourescent light burned out so we called for a replacement and they brought a huge desk lamp to put on our tiny bathroom sink and said it would take over an hour to replace the bulb so they would come back in the morning. Needless to say no one returned even after a few calls to the front desk. The pool was clean and very nice in the evening, being no one was there. Overall, I don't think my husband and I would stay here again or recommend this place to anyone.

Thankfully we had no problem and received a 2nd floor room as requested and check in was fast. The living area and kitchen were nice, nothing fancy, but suited our needs with a toddler. The bedroom was kind of small and the bathroom could use a little updating, but nothing we couldn't deal with. We didn't pay for housekeeping, but ended up receiving it anyway so that was a plus. If I had purchased it I may have been a little upset because most days they didn't get to our room until at least 4pm. Some days later, but we couldn't complain about something we received when we didn't pay for it. The pool are was nice and that was my favorite part of the resort. It wasn't very crowded when we went so there were plenty of chairs available and we were able to swim as we wanted. We were near the pool and basketball court, but didn't have any problem with any noise with that. The only thing that could be a little annoying is the planes constantly flying over throughout the day.

We had a 1 BR unit. All in all we had a very positive stay. As most others have stated, the check-in took forever. Our unit was not available until 6:30 (check-in is 4:00). But it was worth the wait to get a second floor unit in the very back of the complex in Bldg 8 in a unit facing the back \u201cwoods\u201d. It was extremely quiet there. I would avoid units facing the pools as they are open until 1 a.m. and it is very loud. The front desk staff were very cordial and helpful, especially Saimary. They even let us put our groceries in their fridge while our unit was being readied. I think the problem is that they just don\u2019t have enough cleaning staff to handle the immense turnover on weekends. The unit itself was clean and cheery, although it showed a bit of wear. It was well equipped, but one thing I mentioned to them was that it would have been nice if they provided just a few coffee filters (we bought coffee but neglected to buy filters). Luckily there is a Walgreens just a few blocks away to grab those small items. We did suffer a few hours without water due to a water main break in our bldg, but it was fixed quickly. The swimming pools are very nice and a big hit with the kids. As others have mentioned, the washer/dryer units leave a lot to be desired. They are combo units (washer/dryer in one--never saw those before) and while the washer works okay (you must supply your own detergent) the dryer cycle is pitiful. Your best bet is to dry for 2 hours, take the clothes out and shake out the steamy moisture, then dry again before finally taking the clothes out to air dry overnight. That works for shorts and t-shirts, but I would not try something heavy like denim. For the price, we would definitely stay there again as long as we were well away from the pool area.

We stayed here for 18 nights from the beginning of July and were extremely happy with the location, the BEAUTIFUL grounds and the excellent swimming pool area which is superb for families with children. There were a lot of activites which our kids loved; hair-braiding, temporary tattoos, 'dive-in' movies, pizza party etc etc We booked a one-bedroom villa which we were moderately satisfied with but we asked to move after 5 days and were very happy with the offer of a much more spacious one-bedroom villa located close to the pool. The resort is a time-share resort and you will be invited to take the tour and, contrary to what others have written on Trip Advisor, I would say go along. You get a great breakfast, a friendly chat, a nice walk around the grounds and then a no-pressure sales presentation. Your prize? Strongly-reduced prices on theme parks tickets- a great deal. A word of advice if you want to buy into the time share- do not accept the first, second or even third price offer they give you, you can get a deal which is half the price of the first offer. Negatives? 1. Some of the reception staff are very unhelpful and unfriendly, but others are very service-minded. I got round this problem by checking who was in reception before I went there with a question. If the management of Oak Plantation read this: please sort out this issue because it is losing you friends and customers 2. The cleaning of the villas is very up and down, some days it was good, some days bad, all in all very inconsistent 3. Crockery and cutlery in our villa: there just wasn't enough, only a couple of plates etc 4. Range didn't work, but to be fair the maintenance guys were incredibly quick in arriving to fix things- they were virtually at the door before you'd finished calling them. As it happens, we hardly cooked at all anyway, it's cheaper to eat out! 5. No poolside bar (or bar anywhere). This place is crying out for a poolside bar and it would be no problem to set it up in the shaded area overlooking the pond. Alternatively there is another building with a deck overlooking the pond which would be great for a bar/ cafe. Conclusion: this resort has a LOT going for it and we would go back but next time it would be great if ALL the people in reception had the same customer-friendly attitude as the blond-haired girl (can't remember her name) who I think is the supervisor. Oh, one last thing, if the management really wanted to make this place unique, and VERY popular, they could offer child care facilities by extending the child care facilities in the sales presentation building.

He often stays at Residence Inns. He stayed at this Residence Inn for about three months and I had the pleasure of visiting several times for a week at a time. I like Residence Inn becuase the chain accomodates people who work with good wifi and good work space. We had a two bedroom suite with a loft bedroom. I used the downstairs bedroom as an office. We slept in the loft, and loved it, but the comments about possible disturbances from the living room and kitchen are accurate. I was not bothered at all by the airplane noise, but there certainly was airplane noise. It is, after all, an airplort hotel. My husband was bitten by some kind of bug before I got there. Probably a spider, and it was a one time occurance. But I didn't see any bugs at all. The pool area is great. I found the pool temperature to be just right. I'm not sure that its heated, but it gets pretty hot in Miami, even in February, and the pool was refreshing, and always clean. I can imagine that the rooms that overlook the pool, basketball court, and barbeque area might hear some noise from the activities there, but security was pretty vigilant about making sure that the noise was kept to a minimum after nine or ten p.m. I never saw anyone in the pool before nine a.m. I didn't avail myself of any shuttle service so I can't speak to that, but, if you have a car available, this hotel is convenient to lots of fun stuff. Dolphin mall, Calle Ocho, Miami Beach, both airports. . . and Chevy's restaurant is walking distance. I didn't eat there, but on Friday nights they have a great dance party and serve some killer margaritas! We also had some fun at a nearby Irish pub that had good food. It was walking distance, though not as close and convenient as Chevy's. The food at the hotel (breakfast every day and appetizers m-th) was as expected. I had a great experience at this hotel.

While not the nicest Marriott hotel that I have been to, it serves its purpose as an extended stay residence. The primary issue is the noise. There is a train track next to the property, a highway across the street, and it is directly under the landing path of one of the airport's runways. I have served on an aircraft carrier, having plane land over my head, and that was more bearable than the noise at this hotel. The rooms were nice: I had a king suite; it was clean and basic. The kitchenette was very nice, all new stainless steel appliances, decent selection of kitchenware, granite countertops. There was a lot of room to \"spread out\", a marketing phrase they used that was true. I had 2 closets with a lot of space. I noticed that in some of the reviews, there were complaints about ants...I saw a few, but it didn't phase me- I had lived in Florida before, and know that bugs and lizzards are part of a package deal. However, I did receive several bites from something in the bed. One of the major issues that I dealt with besides the airplane noise was kid noise. Being on an extended business trip and working odd hours, it was painful to be woken up at 730 am by children running amuck and screaming. Or on the nights I got to sleep \"early\", people would be playing basketball at 1130pm. The staff there were amazing. I can not say enough good things about the women who worked at the desk.

We booked a 2 king bed suite. The setup was a living room, kitchen, and one bedroom downstairs, with its own bathroom and a double french door separating the bedroom from the living room. The upstairs was a loft, so it was open to the living room below, but also had its own bathroom. Pros: The kitchen was very clean and very modern appliances including fridge/freezer, oven, stove, and dishwasher coffee maker (small), microwave oven, and toaster. The room was very nice, very functional. Lots of closet space to put bags and other such items that were not being used for the stay. The beds were very comfortable. There was a TV in each of the sleeping areas as well as in the living room. The TV in the living room did have auxilary connections so you could plug a DVD player or other such device in. The breakfast provided was adequate, with small variety from day to day. Cons 1. You are right on the MIA approach. The planes are passing overhead close enough for you to see the treads on the wheels. needless to say the noise is almost overwhelming. The airplane traffic is almost constant from about 7 AM until about 9 PM. Even after 9 PM there is traffic, although there is less. If you have the misfortune to be there as we were when a cold front comes through and the winds shift, causing you to be on the takeoff path rather than the landing path, then you will hear almost constant noise until 2 AM or so. It seems there is a lot of outbound traffic in the wee hours of the morning. 2. The loft is dangerous with small children. the bed in the loft is on the pony wall that overlooks the living room, and kids will invariably climb on the bed in order to look out over the pony wall. I could easily see a child falling over the other side, which is at least a 15 foot drop. Our girls were not allowed up into the loft at all. 3. They advertise internet connectivity, but don't fool youself into thinking that it is Wi Fi. It is wired, and the only connection is inside the downstairs bedroom at the desk. There is no connection in the living room or in the upstairs loft. Since I didn't happen to pack a 100' ethernet cable with me, you are limited to working at the desk if you need network connectivity. 4. I did notice you were right on the train line, although we did not have a train go by while we were there. The hotel property does back up to a warehouse area, so I would be leery of the amount of security for the property. Overall the hotel is located in an industrial area with few restaurants. Luckily I lived in Miami for over 20 years, and in fact worked around the corner from that hotel, so I was very familiar with the area and where there were restaurants, markets, etc. Honestly if it wasn't for the planes, the hotel would've ranked very high for me. All I would've had to complain about was the internet connectivity limited to the downstairs bedroom, and that is a relatively minor inconvenience and easily remedied with a switch to wireless. The property was very well located since it has easy access to the Dolphin Expressway (836), which is the main east-west freeway in Miami. you were equidistant from the turnpike and the palmetto expressway (826), as well as several surface traffic arteries (87th Ave, 25th Street,).", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cI checked out it was so bad.\u201d", "Author": "Gtravelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR38410332", "Content": "I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts, and this one just does not cut it.

Rooms go right into the street (not an enclosed building or property) and for some reason that did not made me feel secure. It is basically 4 to 5 double floor townhouses in a small block with 2 or 3 car entries to the street. Asked for a remodeled room, after getting to my car going to the room and carried the bags, it was not. So complained and got one. Then do all the car, bags and steps again. Only the center townhouses with three floors have elevators. the other two floor buildings do not. Internet did not work at all, After complaining to the front desk they told me that I had to call their internet provider directly. That is what I call service. Remodeled rooms look good and clean however the surroundings are very dirty since they are not finished with the remodeling part. Workers all day and you are basically staying there during construction. Their food offering at the front desk is very limited, I found the last Mac and cheese cup available. Will not say here again, By the way, plane noises and train passing noise is very loud.

When you see \"Airport\" in a hotel's name you would think that it is conveniently located to the airport. This hotel is right in the arrival/departure path of runway 8R/26L! For those who are not familiar with the runways at Miami Int'l, this is a long runway used for the larger aircraft. Once the air traffic lightens up around 11:00 p.m. the trains start. I was not aware that ear plugs were available. I had to suffer a week at this place due to a lack of rooms elsewhere (Super Bowl week).

And yes the airplanes did fly over us continuously - fasinating sight despite the noise - didn't bother us in the least. Trains passed by about twice for the week. The hotel is located close to a bus stop on 84th Ave so moving around to various locations is not a problem. We toured the entire Dade county, visited the Metro Zoo and Seaquarium via the transit system. The longest we ever waited on a bus was 10 mins. Walmart, restaurants, grocery shopping is approximately a 10 min walk from the hotel. Spent 6 days.

We had a full kitchen, living room (with a fireplace) and bedroom and it was great to be able to stretch out and truly relax. My husband and I stayed here for two nights before leaving on a cruise on Monday, May 16 and we met our friends who were here for an entire week before we arrived, and they were just as comfortable and happy with their stay as we were. The breakfast buffet was very generous and everything was fresh and tasty. Of course, we were right near the airport and planes were flying overhead (which we of course expected), but this fact in no way created any problems with sleep for any of us, and we DID NOT have to use the ear plugs supplied by the Residence Inn staff. The only potential problem we might have had is that the hotel being so close to the airport is not really close to the mainstream of everything in Miami Beach and surrounding areas to see and do. However, our friends had their car and we were fortunate to be able to drive to wherever we wanted or needed to go.

(but really what do you expect for $40 a night) You are better off to head to the grocery store across the street and get milk and cereal. Also, the rooms used real keys, I prefer the electronic locks that can be changed. But with the maintenance guy always around I never felt the least bit unsafe. All and all the Positives far outweigh the negatives.

The carpets seem relatively new. The bed also seemed fairly new, but the box spring was not. They have a mattress pad on the bed, that was full of stains, the mattress pad was topped by a flat sheet, and then another flat sheet, and then a bedspread. As most people know, even fitted sheets have a tendency to loosen and come off a bed, but a flat sheet as the bottom sheet, is even worse. It probably wouldn't have been so bad if the mattress pad wasn't so disgustingly stained. The pillows were terrible. The word, \"pancake,\" comes to mind. The remote for the TV doesn't work very well. You have to hold your tongue and the button just right to change the volume or the channel. We have three days worth of garbage built up here because we have NOT seen a MAID since we checked in. I guess that is why they offer a three day special rate? They only send in the maids after you have checked out? Too bad. They missed out a several dollars tip that was sitting here waiting for them. We won't be tipping upon check out. Our bathroom smells of body odor. Yuck! I went to Wal-Mart today and bought an air freshener to hang inside. There is only a shower in the room, not a bathtub. The air conditioner works well. I have not seen any bugs, which is important to me. The location is extremely convenient to so many things, especially if you have a car. I have no idea how the public transportation is. There was a car parked outside that had a dented in front windshield. It almost looked as though something was thrown off the top floor, landing on the car's windshield and splintering it. As a result, I parked on the back row so I wouldn't be parked right under the top floor. Everyone else followed suit after I set the stage, including the car with the damaged windshield. The supplies are very sparse. There was 2 bars of soap, and 2 shampoo, and ice bucket and some plastic cups, but no hair dryer, or coffee maker. There is a microwave and mini-fridge. It was quiet, and didn't really see and unsavory types around. The door to the room was full of grungy, dirty fingerprints. Both my husband and I tried to wipe it down, and get rid of them. The bathroom door was old and dark, so for all I know, it is dirty and grungy too. If we had maid service today like we were promised, and actually got a fitted sheet on our bed, I would've considered staying here again, since we will be back in a few days, but no maid service is not acceptable. So we won't be staying here next week, or ever again.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cfantastic friendly place\u201d", "Author": "Robmcfc", "ReviewID": "UR18115249", "Content": "I cannot understand anybody having a problem with the goldenlink.MY wife and i have been to florida every year for the past nine years and as always we spend three or four days here and have never had a problem.

Unfortunately, they did not have any rooms available. I was aware of the Golden Link and walked in. They immediately offered to let me look at the room. The front desk staff, especially Sheila, were very friendly and accomodating. We were in room 429 and it was immaculate. This is an older property but has been recently renovated. The carpet, beds and furniture were relatively new. The sheets were new and of good quality. There is excellent security and we felt very safe. The pool was clean and warm. Even though the pool is at the front of the property we enjoyed watching the traffic and activity. You cannot be seen easily from the road. There are many restaurants within walking distance. This property is family owned and operated by the original owners and it is obvious that they take great pride in their motel. I would happily staff there again.

A newly decorated room with a huge walk in shower along with new fixtures and fittings in the main room, inclusive of a very comfortable bed/settee. All very pleasing in particular the huge kingsize bed. There has been a change of staff since our previous visits and yet we found 'all' the new people to be just as capable and knowledgeable as those we encountered on previous stays. We liked the idea of 'no bar' which seemed to keep the 'drinking tourists away', though we did enjoy the odd six pack around the sumptious pool.

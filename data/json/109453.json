When I arrived I had to wait 2 hours to get room because the hotel was full. now once I got a room the place was nice until the next morning I saw a roach in the bathroom so I killed it. I told the manager and he did move me to another room and promised to refund me some of my room fee back. The new room was nice, but I saw another roach in light in the bathroom the next day. I did received my discount for the room, but I would not stay at that motel 6 again. 2380 W Northwest Hwy, Dallas, TX 75220.

I would never stay at this location again. I overheard a hotel guest complaining at the front desk about a laptop being stolen from their room. The front desk manager was watching security tapes to try to determine what happened. I made a mental note to take my laptop with me whenever I left the room! The worst situation I saw was housekeeping had children going into the rooms with them! I saw a boy about 8 years old and a girl around 4 years old. There is no way those children could be properly supervised if the housekeeper was doing her job. The kids could have been into the guest's luggage, personal items, etc. God forbid that one of those children would get into a guest's medication! It is completely inexcusable for children to be in the rooms with the housekeeper! This situation will be reported to Motel 6 Corporate. This property used to be a La Quinta. It has potential to be a really nice budget hotel. Sadly, it doesn't appear that it's on the right track.

It was cheap! Breakfast is powdered scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, white bread, cereals, and juice. Not great but it is provided and adequate. An IHOP is right up the street! The internet service was very spotty, and during one 24 hour period I had to ask them to reboot the router 4 times. I think others have complained about that.

We stayed here on points earned. We booked a queen suite; easy check in; nice gentlemen at the front desk. This hotel is in need of a good updating. The carpet in the halls are very worn; holes in some places. The room is very tired and decor dated. We booked for three adults; our 21 year old son to use the sofa bed. The first room was equipped with a sink, microwave, and fridge. A desk/chair, sleeper sofa, coffee table, and television are in the front room. Double doors open into the bedroom. A television is also in this room. The mattress on the bed needs to be replaced; sheets were dingy. Carpet was old and worn. Checked the sofa bed upon arrival; dirty sheets from food and 'stuff' falling thru the couch onto the sofa bed. Sheets were stained with what looked like blood that didn't come out in the wash. Slept like a typical sofa bed. Found hairs in the tub; towels were very thin and big enough to cover an elementary aged child. The bathroom is relatively small; the sink is located just outside the bath area. Tight space to move around in. The breakfast was presented nicely but was standard continental breakfast fare. The exception was the variety of juices and flavored coffee creamers offered. The breakfast area is large. The business office has one computer. The pool is indoors and was not open when we were there. My son checked out the fitness center and said he didn't want to use it - too much out of date. The only people from the hotel we encountered were two different gentlemen at the front desk and the young lady running the breakfast area. They were polite and professional. While this is a good location for Love Field we won't stay here again. It may be a good deal but it needs better cleaning and is in serious need of a remodel.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glenpool, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cDecent, affordable stay for family\u201d", "Author": "acemom98", "ReviewID": "UR17419682", "Content": "In a grouping of average hotels, we found this Inn to have the only room to affordably and most comfortably accommodate our family of 5 (3 girls + parents) in one room for 3 nights (2 Q + sofabed).

Beds were feather toppers on old mattress, so that's a personal opinion - mixed reviews among our family, but we did all sleep. The breakfast was better than expected, with a good variety of choices (same choices each day, but many options). The pool and hot tub area were nice and never really busy. All the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The area across the highway loop is not such a great area, but food, fuel & shopping is pretty easily accessible past that small spot or even back the other way from the loop.

The good thing about that was there was a sitting room of sorts that separated the bedroom from the hallway. If noise was an issue, I didn't notice it. Room also had a fridge, two televisions (one in the bedroom, one in the sitting room). The AC was kind of loud, but I personally like to have a slight bit of room noise. Everything in the room worked fine. Only two minor complaints- the fitness center is in big need of a remodel. They just need to replace everything in there.

We picked this hotel because it has an indoor swimming pool and hot tub - that was our main reason for picking it and the fact that we usually stay in La Quintas. It was everything we expected and more. For $100 a night we got the indoor pool and hot tub which was really nice - we got a VERY spacious room with TWO tvs which would be great for people traveling with children. It was very clean, had a fridge, microwave, a fold out couch bed, a desk, a kitchen sink, and it had two sets of french doors seperating the two rooms... the room with the king size bed, and the room with the couch. It had everything we wanted, the people were friendly, we had no problem with getting the room we had asked for... king/smoking... and the free breakfast was pretty good. They had eggs and sausage... the sausage was really good and so was teh orange juice. It's a kind of small hotel so we there weren't many people, and therefore we had the pool and hot tub to ourselves! And the pool and hot tub hours are 6AM to 12 midnight which was REALLY nice!! They also had an exercise room. We were very suprised by the size of our room. And of course like most La Quintas they had the regular movies you could rent and adult movies also on the TV. It was better than expected. Oh, and the king bed had a down mattress pad on it... which helped with the comfort. Not sure what kind of feathers were in it, but it was nice. The air conditioner (which we didn't use because it was November) but the air conditioner had a piece of curved plastic on it that I'm guessing is suppose to help manuever the air flow towards you instead of up into the air which I thought was pretty cool. And the shower/bath tub had a curved shower curtain which I love! Anyway, it was a wonderful place to stay for the price - we were VERY pleased, and we had a very nice, pleasent stay. Great place, would highly recommend!! Would have added some photos, but I didn't take any!

I felt like the maid didn't do that great of a job so I only let her clean once. I always bring my own lysol or clorox wet wipes and wipe every thing down so I didn't see the need for her to come back. The pillows and the bed were very nice. It also had a ceiling fan in the living room. The staff was friendly enough. I say confusing location only because you can only take a right out of the hotel unless you go to the hotel next door and drive along a fence, etc... to make a right.

After walking around for a bit and coming back, we get our room. It's small, but it's New York, whatever, that's fine with me, the only time we were in the room was to sleep (the bed was amazing!) and shower (clean in the bathroom) the room was immaculate and the air conditioner worked so we were great. No noise or anything during the night while sleeping, very quiet and the elavator was right there. I will say that Chris was awesome too! Hope you enjoyed the Susansnaps man!

Good location if you are travelling from abroad. However, the hotel floor I am on (fifth floor) reeks of sweat. The rooms are sad and tired... this place hasn't been painted in years and years and there are pock marks and scratches on all of the walls, all of the fixtures, the bathrooms are clean but the equipment itself is tired, old, and worn out. The bed sheets were eminently adequate. This is supposedly a boutique property. It isn't. It has a wishful thinking mentality within the Chatwal family of hotels and it either needs to be sold to kinder, mor caring owners, or it needs to get an injection of cash for a major refurbishment. At $250 per night this is hardly a bargain given what one gets. Especially because the room is just depressing. I can totally see someone having a breakdown of sorts here. EVERY wall in my suite is blank--both in the sitting room and in the actual bedroom. But for a TV that is plasma this could be a fleabag motel on 11th avenue. And the furniture, though perhaps sleek in its first three years of use, is seriously in need of replacement. Overall two thumbs down. This property is part of the \"Preferred\" Family of hotels. It doesn't deserve to be.

For instance, in our room there were some marks and stains on the wall, definitely it should be better to re-paint. Also we could not open the door of the fridge, one of the phone was not working and when we arrived the safe was locked and we had to wait the manager to unlock (a room ready to check in should be completely checked by housekeeping and safe should be ready to use). In the hotel there are only 2 lifts for 16 floors. Same lifts are used by staff too, housekeeping and maintenance (there is no staff elevator) so often you have to wait quite a long. There is no free WIFI connection in the room, only in the lobby where there are only 2 small armchairs, often busy, so it is not really comfortable if you want to quickly check your emails with your laptop. In the room there is no Tea/Coffee facility. The restaurant Serafina serves good food but I found it overpriced comparing to the other restaurants near by. The bar has a nice ambience, very cool but often the whole area is reserved for private party and not accessible to the Hotel guests. The staff at reception are polite and friendly, but I noticed a lack of eye contact and smiles, the doormen instead are always ready to welcome you with a big smile and wishing you a \"good day\". A smile and a eye contact always make a positive difference and make the guest feels welcome. What really disappointed me was the housekeeping and the management. Briefly I collect coins from each city I visit and as usual I leave the coins I do not intend to spend on my bedside. After few days I noticed that the coins were missing. I was very upset, not for the coins itself but for the principle that from my room should not disappear even one penny\u2026 the housekeeping might have tought it was left as tips but in my opinion, if you would like to leave tips either you leave a note either you leave it on the departure day. So my advice for future guests is do not forget to lock your money in the safe unless you wanna leave some tips\u2026.. I reported the episode to the reception, they said they had to investigate but nobody reverted back, not during the rest of my stay, not at check out. Perhaps this is something a guest would expect from the management of a 4* Hotel, a few lines of apologies. Following this situation I left the room with the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d as I was upset, well the first day they respected my willness, but then they entered to clean my room even with the \u201cdo not disturb sign\u201d, and I believe this was very \u201crude\u201d. At that point I found it even ridiculous and a waste of time reported the episode to the reception. I really believe that few of the above negative aspects are not difficult to fix it like the maintenance of the hotel and perhaps a development customer training to the staff so that a guest can be happy to return, otherwise it is easy look for something else, the area is completely full of hotels, restaurants, bars, etc, etc. Everything you need is there, few steps away. What makes you come back is the customer serviced received.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntingdon, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING STAFF!\u201d", "Author": "bluoshun1", "ReviewID": "UR125952397", "Content": "We absolutely loved out stay in NYC at the TIME - location was perfect - room was \"hip\" and the staff was so friendly !

Entrance to the hotel is strange, as You have the entrance (where mostly but not always a doorman stands), then you have a small corridor and a lift that takes You to the second floor (reception)... if You want to get to Your room you have to go to different lifts hidden deeper in the entrance corridor. So it was sometimes strange, as You could go back to the hotel without the doorman waiting and bypass the reception on your way to the room... Room was clean. Towels, pillows etc. were clean. Had hot and cold water. Ironing board was dirty. Everything worked. Toilet got stuck a few times. Room definitely could use a refurbishment. I lived on the 6th floor, bad window view - oh! and the windows did not open, so no chance for some fresh air. AC was loud (could switch on itself in the middle of the night and make some noise) so was the ventilator in the bathroom. Door to room - well it worked, but You could hear EVERYTHING from the corridor. You could say that it is a designer hotel... but when something has not been refurbished when needed it looses it's \"designer\" status... right? I mean i.e. you have the Artemide lamps next to the bed and on the desk. Well... one lamp had isolation tape around the cable, and the desk one was screwed to the desk in such a way that it moved, and You had a hole next to the lamp (signs of a previous different lamp?)... so it's a over-used, not refurbished in time designer room... You get the picture. This is definitely not a 4-star hotel in European standards. Rather 3 stars. Staff was very kind and helpful. Awkward thing was that the hotel didn't have a service elevator, so You could meet the staff, cleaning ladies etc. in the lifts quite often. And since the hotel has 16 floors and two lifts You could meet them quite often (but still they were very kind). Business - No. This is rather not a hotel for a business trip. Family with kids - errr, rather not. Friends, Solo - yes. Senior - rather not. Couples - errr, depends what Your looking for (note that the door... You hear EVERYTHING through it). Food/Breakfast - they have the Serafina Restaurant on the ground floor. Ate only breakfasts two times there - was ok. Bottom line: Hey this is New York. If You want 5 stars then You have to pay a minimum of 350$ per night... or You can stay at The Time and spend that money on theaters, musicals, food and shopping - face it - You don't spend Your whole day in Your hotel room when in New York.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cHip hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "careyes45", "ReviewID": "UR125324897", "Content": "Great decor and lighting.

In the 30 years I have been travelling to Manhattan on business, I have never paid less and never expected such a terrific experience. Two qualifiers: First, anyone who stays in NYC knows the rooms are small. Duh. Try Europe if you think NYC rooms are small. I had a spacious one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15th floor (1503) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was just great. Second, most NY hotels that have big rooms are at least two to three times as much with no character. If you want to stay in a stale, unimaginative hotel room, be their guest: pay more for the big brand labels and then get ready for really crummy service over priced food, Internet and drinks. But if you like a boutique experience a la San Francisco, this hotel is a gem for the price with several BIG advantages: 1. Location, location, location: right off of Times Square, a new Food Emporium steps away, best Starbucks in the US (with a Clover machine \u00ef\ufffd\u0160) and in the heart of Broadway. 2. Great bed: It was double-sheeted, high quality all around and comparable to W beds (not kidding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mine was). 3. Thick towels: This is a rare find even in the big brands in NY. Towels were really dense and a pleasant surprise. Even had two nice comfy robes to lounge around in. 4. Design: Yes the hotel is showing its age and is a little worn, but the deep primary colors, cool desk, Bose radio, room safe, iron and ironing board, blow dryer, toiletries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just about everything had a little flair. 5. Window shades and lighting: Again, the design takes the old and makes it new with a large pull down screen shade that blurs so others can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see and black out pull down shades for total darkness. Plus dim lighting controls so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blind yourself going to the restroom in the middle of the night. 6. Sight and sounds: I thought my room was occupied when I first opened the door. Jazz was playing from the Bose radio and there was a really nice scent in the air. The housekeeper had just prepped the room for my arrival. How cool is that? 7. Service: Young, hip and nice. How many times these days do these three words go together. A very nice surprise is what I found for the time I spent at The Time (3 nights) and yes, I would go again even if I paid a bit more as long as I get the same room.

The room had no real closet, but an ironing board and iron in room (not always a given in NYC) and a nice bathrobe.

You have to put your stuff on the toilet cover or on the floor - The clock in the room wasn't set right - The lights above the bed are hard to turn off.

Upon check-in we went to the room to settle in and found that the shades were badly worn and one didn't close all the way. The furniture in this tiny space was chipped and very tired. The shelving in the micro bathroom was falling apart and the shower was a mix of tiles and faux tiles with mold in the corners. The toilet wouldn't stop running without some manual help and later in the stay it overflowed, which didn't seem to surprise the front desk. The king bed was comfortable but the sheets were too small for it, exposing the bed pad at the foot of the bed after 5 minutes of sleep. Restaurant was great,true to Serafina's reputation. Elevators are tiny and used by service staff ALL DAY! always waiting to get to the upper floors was frustrating to say the least.

When I went to check in, it took the three juvenile, unprofessional and class-less people behind the desk nearly ten minutes to acknowledge me, even though I was in line at the desk and there was only one other customer in the lobby. One of the reasons it took so long is because one of those three individuals had, apparently, broken wind at the reception desk, stinking up the lobby. The male worker was so busy making a big deal about it and drawing attention to it that they were all distracted. There was no opportunity for a good night's rest for two reasons. First, my phone kept inexplicably ringing in the middle of the night due to some malfunction. Second, in the early morning hours, hotel employees were loudly coming and going down the hall, slamming doors up and down the floor. The day I checked out, the elevator was broken. A hotel employee cut in front of me to get into the only working elevator with a cart so large that only he and the cart could fit in the elevator. When I explained that I had been waiting for a very long time (and needed to check out), he angrily told me he needed the elevator because the other one was broken. On the day I checked in, my bags had to be stored for a few hours. I had to call reception three times (over the course of half an hour) to get my bags even though I was the only person who checked in during the time I was in the lobby. The last day I was at the hotel, the hallways were littered with trash. There were huge trashbags on the floors for hours that final morning.

Since I was traveling alone and decided not to stay with friends during this trip. I decided on The Times Hotel in NYC. I did read many reviews before settling on this hotel. The reviews were mixed; overall I did not get the feeling that It was the worst hotel in the area. I checked in for only two nights-- I loved the fact that the hotel is really a hands throw from Times Square-- The trouble began when I called to ensure that my reservations were confirmed; the person whom I spoke with was perhaps the rudest person ever! instead of asking me to hold the line, while she checked on my accomodations, she said nothing.. I was on hold for a good five minutes; when she returned, she never apologized for the wait, nor did she apologize for telling me that there were no reservations under my name, even though I did give her a confirmation number. Eventually my reservation was located; when I arrived at the hotel, the main check point is on the second floor; there was no one to assist with my bags; when I got to the room, I was beyond dismayed; the room was so tiny; I quickly got over the size of the room, as I was only staying two nights. When I went into the bathroom, I was a bit taken aback-- it was not modern at all, and it was not very clean ( on the surface, yes) however, the WHITE towels were on a rack that was visible dirty as well as dusty: I did not find out until later that night that the bathroom sink had a leak. At this point, I should have requested a new room; however, again, since it was only two nights... I decided to stay. The next day when I came back to the room after some sightseeing-- I noticed that there were food trays left in the hall by others, not just one tray, but at least 3-4; when I entered the room, It was obvious that someone had been in, as the bed was turned back for the evening. The sheets had not been changed; nor had the floor been vaccumed. The afternoon that I checked out was perhaps the best part of my stay, the doorman was very helpful and someone even helped with my bags. I would say that if you are looking for a place just to sleep, that is relatively inexpensive, that is very close to TS, this would be an ideal hotel, anything more than two days... I would not recommend. My reason is really based upon the fact that the service was not that great, and the room was just dirty-- on my next visit, I will plan to pay to stay at another hotel.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel, but too much wears everywhere\u201d", "Author": "chies1", "ReviewID": "UR102110137", "Content": "We stayed at The Time last weekend. When we did the booking, we were attracted by the fact that it is a Tihany design and its great location. However, after our stay we were a little bit disappointed. I will start with what we liked: This hotel is indeed quite nicely located. It is very close to time square, but since it is not in time square, it is relatively quiet. The service was also not too bad, especially the guys working the ground floor. (I am a bit annoyed by the guy who did the check out. He didn't seems very eager to serve the guest) However, they did give us a room earlier than other people because they saw that we have a baby with us. We appreciated that. The biggest problem with the hotel, however, is that the rooms looks old and dirty. The carpet looks dirty and way too much wear. The walls have many scuff marks that is almost unacceptable. In the shower, many places between the tiles are turing black and very unclean. Our toilet also stopped working on the second day. Please see the pictures I have posted for reference. We have booked 2 rooms, and both of them are quite small--in fact one of them is really tiny even though they charge us the same amount. Lastly, for the price we are paying, we are also surprise that there isn't any coffee maker in the room. As a conclusion, I agree with the complains other member is posting. The hotel really need to step up its maintenance--like repaint the wall as a starter.

Another improvement would be to notify clients that there are premium tickets that could be purchased in advance for the ferry ride to Liberty Island in order to avoid the 1.5 hr line. The last improvement would be to inform clients where to pick up tickets.

With that in mind, we decided to try The Time since it also a Vikram Chatwal Hotel. I don't think we will make the same choice next time. The best thing about the hotel was it's convenient location. It was close enough to walk to attractions, but far enough away from Times Square to avoid huge crowds. Just avoid the times when Chicago (across the street) opens and closes. The first thing I found quirky was the second floor lobby. It was fine for check-in, but offered little in the way of interacting with the staff unless you wanted to ride in two elevators. My wife commented that it was almost like living in an apartment building. Not a big deal, just a little quirky. Initially, the room seemed nice enough. It was clean, but starting to show it's age. There wasn't much of a view, but it's New York City, so you're likely to be staring at a building no matter the view. The first problem was the heating/cooling system. The system was noisy and the choices were virtually on or off, regardless of the temperature setting on the thermostat or the other controls. The next issue was the constant noise from the elevator, it was non-stop regardless of the time of day and it made sleeping difficult. The television set was a wall-mounted flat panel, but the exposed cable wire (they hid the outlet, but couldn't bother with the cable line .. really?), lousy sound and lack of high-definition made it seem like an afterthought. The bathroom was clean, but there were definite problems. The first problem was the sink almost coming off of it's pedestal and separating from the wall. Apparently the maintenance staff believes that caulk is a structural material. The other problem was with the shower control. The knob or the valve was stripped to the point that it took several minutes of slowly adjusting the knob back and forth, so that the hot water wouldn't scald my wife. I'm on vacation, I don't want to do fixes like I'm at home. Two other small things that we found annoying was the $6 dollar charge for storing our bags, a practice of which I nor my wife had every heard (it seems like \"nickel and diming\" the customers), and the small $12 glass of sangria at the Sarafina bar which seems a bit ridiculous when compared to the $6 bottle of Stella Artois I bought at the same bar.

So I ended up paying $200/night + tax, etc. The suite was two separate rooms, with the pull out sofa bed only being suitable for my 14-year old son, who could sleep on anything, really. But, with the suite, you couldn't complain about the size of the room in NYC. POSITIVES: * Location, Location, Location - stayed on 10th floor. Very cozy and warm as we were in NYC for the 5th largest blizzard in NYC history! Amazing! With this location, weather didn't stop us from doing anything - just walked out the door with easy access to everything! * Kind of hip -- but drab for sure. Since I was only traveling with my two teens (and this was their first NYC experience) they loved it, therefore I loved it. NEGATIVES: * If you are used to more service, attention or standard hotel amenities - than you might want to pick the Hilton or the Marriett. If you can get a low rate, I would absolutely recommend The Time -- in fact, I would go back, simply for the location. If you pay a premium price, than I would suggest getting a little more for your money at a mainstream hotel. Use WI-FI in the lobby because they will charge your $10.60 to log on for 24 hours/per computer in your room Bottom line, we spent maybe 5-6 hours a day in the room -- it was easy to drop off packages, get warmed up, put on dry clothes and head back out to the most amazing city in the world.

Check-in and door staff were friendly upon arrival however we experienced various problems upon getting to our room including blocked toilet, in-room safe locked closed, no plug for bathroom sink, all compounded by the in-room telephone not working so we had to go back down to reception to report these issues (the hotel only has two lifts so this can be quite a slow process). To be fair to the hotel, the maintenance man quickly attended to each of these problems but the fact remains that they should not arise in the first place at a 4 star hotel. Any remaining positive sentiment we may have had towards this hotel was totally destroyed on the third morning when we awoke to find the carpet in our room soaking wet. I travel extensively for both work and leisure and never before or since have I experienced a situation where the hotel staff have comprehensively turned what was clearly the hotel's problem into the guest's problem. Upon reporting the problem, the maintenance man came to our room to inspect the problem - recognising that we had also had all the other problems on the first day, he was apologetic and advised that he would speak to reception and arrange for us to be moved to a new room. This was where the problems started as reception did not call us then when I went downstairs to find out what was happening they made out it was our problem and we shouldn't have expected them to call us. They then told us we had to pack up our room ourselves and bring all our belongings down to reception and we would be allocated a new room later in the day once one became available without a hint of an apology for the situation which ended up wasting a couple of hours of our holiday (who wants to repack all their bags mid way through a week long stay?) nor an offer for the hotel to move our bags for us or do anything else they could to minimise the inconvenience. I was absolutely dumbfounded by the treatment we received here - in all my travels in the USA I have always found the customer service to be the best in the world, however the service we received from the girl on reception that day was comprehensively the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I should note that when we were ultimately allocated a new room, we were upgraded to a suite but that was only after we had earlier spoken to the Duty Manager about our dissatisfaction with the relevant staff member. In the interests of balance, I note that the hotel was in a good location very close to Times Square and we had no issues with street noise in our 9th or 11th floor rooms, nor could we hear any noise from the on-site bar on the reception level which was very loud on Fri/Sat night. The housekeeping staff were also very friendly. As others have noted, the standard rooms are relatively small but I was expecting that in NYC. It would be helpful if the hotel had some accurate photos of the bathrooms on their website - whilst they are adequate for their purpose they are quite small and the shower cleanliness/condition reflects that it seems to have been a few years since the last refurb. The hotel also has free wi-fi on the reception level which is great although would obviously be better if this was extended to the rooms. Overall, I would have been happy to recommend this hotel on the basis of value for money and location but the chance of having to deal with the most unhelpful staff member in the world and the myriad of similar alternatives available in NYC means I would recommend looking elsewhere before staying at The Time.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDirty little W wantabe\u201d", "Author": "Tmill32", "ReviewID": "UR90912833", "Content": "The tiny poorly maintained room would have been tolerable if not for the endless clanking noise of the heating system which sounded like 300 blacksmiths were working their way up to our room.

The couple next to us also had their card declined, so it seemed as though it was their machines that were having difficulty, not our cards. Everything eventually got sorted out though. When we got to the room, it was pretty much what I expected from previously viewing others' photos on tripadvisor. We got a red room, which seemed relatively clean. Yes, it wasn't the biggest room I've ever stayed in, but considering it is Manhattan AND close to Time Square, that didn't bother me in the least bit. There was enough room for it to be easy and comfortable. Our room's windows faced the street, but I wasn't annoyed by outside noise. On the other hand, the room next to us seemed to be housing around 5 guys who enjoyed partying until 4am. Everything was eventually handled professionally by the staff. If I had to nitpick, the only other thing that wasn't A+ was the television. Although it was a nice big flatscreen, the cable wasn't the best and the remote gave us all sorts of trouble.

Highly recommend you grab the 48 hour hop on hop off Double Decker and get yourself orientated, we then went on a Liberty Helicopter tour over Manhattan and started our 3 Day New York Pass which I also highly recommend, this had us running all over that fabulous city seeing everything you could see, it was wonderful to have express entry into everything, have individual maps and details in our little booklet/pass. Make sure you organise yourself in areas, so do all the downtown stuff in one day, then uptown, etc. We took a beautiful Winter horse and carriage ride thru' Central Park, it was so romantic. As I said we won this trip to see Kings Of Leon at Madison Square Garden in Jan 09 and won 3 nights acccommodation, Airfare & tickets as part of the prize, and knew you just can't do New York in 3 days. The food is fabulous, you need to search it out, there is some great street food, google before you go and you will find where the locals hidden gems are. Highly recommend Carmines in Times Square - my husband Romeo is Italian and this was recommended to us by Italian's we know, the service was impeccable and the prices were low and great quality food - ask for Ralph from Brooklyn to be your waiter ha ha, he was a tripper! The Time is all about location location location, it was perfect for us, everything was close by, the Subway, the Port Authority (we went on a brilliant shopping tour), entertainment, food, shopping - get your little souvenirs downtown, much cheaper! So much to say about New York!

There was free internet in the rooms! Yup, completely free wireless lan. For those who haven't checked in there's even free internet in the 2nd floor lobby / bar. The rooms are noisy.

First of all, the hotel's location in W49th Street is excellent. I was able to walk to many places of interest and some of the further tourist attractions (the Museum Mile, Statue Of Liberty) were all simple subway rides away. Broadway is literally on the doorstep as is Times Square and there is a large chemist nearby which is also handy. The rooms as expected were quite small but were clean and had all you would need for a short city break (iron, hairdryer, nice towels). The bed was very comfortable (though I had to remove the bolster pillows to fit on the bed and I am only 5'9\"!) and the shower is also very good, easy to operate and spacious. The staff were polite but more reactive than proactive. However, when it came down to it, they did help as much as they could and remained professional throughout. The only problems I had were with the Do Not Disturb sign which is a switch on the back of the peephole. I accidentally switched mine on (one thing to note - i was not shown up to my room by a concierge and had an embarrasing episode trying to locate the bathroom light switch which was behind the towel rail!) and as a result, my room was not cleaned and it was only when I asked the cleaner that this was explained to me so if you do stay here, be careful of that! There is a restaurant attached to the hotel which is pricey and not the biggest portions but is fine if you are tired or can't decide where to eat. However, for breakfast, I discovered a branch of the Magnolia Bakery on 6th Ave which was only a short walk away and for dinner, there was an excellent Thai restaurant on 46th called Yum Yum which had amazing food at a reasonable price. If this is your first time in New York, i wouldn't necessarily recommend this hotel - that's not say it is a bad hotel but for a first trip, i think it can be quite overwhelming.

Let's start with the location. Being located at 49th between 7th and 8th - you couldn't ask for a better location. The area was quiet at night, which surprised me for the location and you are so close to everything. We went to see Billy Elliot (which was great) and the walk back to the hotel was only a few blocks away. Within only a few steps you are within Times Square and it was great for being able to go out at night and take pictures. The hotel is just down the street from Grayline tours location, so when we wanted to book a tour it was just down the street (I don't like booking from the guys hounding me on the street). To find this hotel look for the Yellow Serafina restaurant sign. It's right next door to the O'Neil theater. Price - I got a deal through Priceline - and couldn't complain about the price. I would use Priceline again and try to get the Time. Room - we stayed in a King Room - Yellow. The room was bigger than I thought (still tiny but you're not in NYC to stay in the room). The room was very clean and we didn't have any issues about the paint falling off, mold etc. The room had a Bose Wave radio and a flat screen tv. We used the safe and didn't have any issues. I didn't buy anything from the minibar as those things are crazy over priced in all hotels. You have to be careful because the fridge is weight censored so it might think you've taken something if you move things around. I can see having an issue if you have large suitcases for storage, there isn't any drawer space (at least in our room) but our suitcases were carry on size so this wasn't an issue. The bed was comfortable, my mom didn't like the pillows but I didn't have an issue. The bed itself was comfortable, I know someone reviews have said the bed is too hard but I didn't notice. Bathroom - the room came with housecoats, which I thought was a nice touch. The products they supplied were nice and replaced as I used them. I can't remember the name of them but were were given everything needed. Our towels were replaced daily even though we hung them back up ourselves. I recall reading one review saying their towels weren't replaced everyday. There is a sign in the bathroom that says they are trying to be \"green\" and only replacing the towels when requested. If you hang the towels up, they are not replaced. The one complaint my mother had was the temperature of the water in the shower.....it went from HOT to scalding HOT!! I could handle the coldest temperature but my mom still found it too hot. The thing that I liked, the hair dryers were real hairdryers...not those stupid things attached to the walls that take an hour to dry your hair. Staff - staff at the front desk was nice. We didn't have any issues with them. I didn't have any problems where I needed help so my review of the staff is limited. the guys at the front door were helpful and pointed out the Olympic Diner for breakfast on 8th ave. They make a mean French toast. YUMMY!!! We didn't eat at the hotel so I have no idea what the food is like. I never saw a lot of people in there. I would stay at the time again in a second.

The rooms are small - this is Manhattan and if you want a big room, you're gonna pay huge bucks for it. But, it had everything you needed and some nice perks too. The Bose Wave radio (it's not an Ipod dock as one reviewer expected... it's a radio!) has a great sound. Our room was toward the back of the hotel and overlooked rooftops, so we left the curtains down. A windowbox light made it appear that sunlight was streaming in, even though the drapes were closed. The TV remote has a sensor that is not attached to the TV so if you place things on the desk that block the sensor, the remote won't work. (Another problem cited by a different reviewer.) There is an expensive mini bar - typical. WIFI was iffy, but the in-room ethernet connection worked great. We had a \"red\" room which felt vaguely \"Japanese\" to me with clean lines, black furniture and no wasted space. Bathroobes to lounge in were fluffy.The huge shower had plenty of hot water and pressure. Everything was clean. Maids were wonderful about coming in when it was convenient for us. There is a parking garage right across the street. The hotel is about 1/2 block to the very top of Times Square and about 2 blocks to the heart of it. The play \"Chicago\" is at the theatre right across the street. They were loading out \"Spring Awakening\" from next door and \"Mamma Mia\" is just out and around the corner. There is a Food Emporium across the street and 1/2 block down - upstairs is deli food and basement had a grocery store great for families watching their $$. Lots of cool sidewalk vendors on 9th ave, just aroudn the block. Subway, shopping, theatre, it's all within easy walking distance. Everything was clean. The staff was wonderful.

Aside from this it was cheap - around $200 a night and the same price as 2-3* bigger hotels in the area that are of the same standard or maybe better. Dear Sir or Madam I am writing to let you know of my bad experience at your hotel. I am from Australia and came to visit Washington DC, Chicago and New York. In DC I stayed at the Renaissance Mayflower, and in Chicago at the Sutton Place. Both hotels were of a VERY high standard, with amazing service and a good overall experience. They both fall into the same category as the Time Hotel. However my experience at the Time was at the other end of the spectrum. I have never written to a hotel before but wanted to share my experience with you. On entering the room, I noticed a strong smell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an unpleasant smell almost like a bad musty smell of mould. I thought it would disappear but it remained over the 3 days stay. The room was small (OK, that I can put up with given that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NY and a lot of hotels are like this). On entering the bathroom, I noticed horrible black grime along the shower door (see photos attached). The shower leaked too. I notified reception later that night, hoping I would get used to the smell and asked if I could change and was told it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, as all the rooms are the same and none were available, so I put up with it. The airconditioner was rattling all night. So it was either a situation of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstay awake but be a good temperature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thing, or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctry to sleep, but be hot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 due to turning it off. Checkin staff were friendly but when I went to ask for my room to be made up at 1pm and for my toilet to be unblocked, it seemed like I had asked for the biggest request possible. I came back at 3pm, it was still not done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so I phoned down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c asking again, but of course returning after shopping at 5.30pm it had not been done. THREE times I had to ask and after the third time the housekeeper was sent right up and did a great job. The housekeepers were VERY friendly as were the bellboys. The reception staff on Friday 8th August though were rude, uncourteous and rather \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In fact, going down for a third time to ask for my room to be made up and toilet unblocked I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even receive an apology.

It's full of people and tourist awed by feeling like being in the center of the Earth. However, I was one of those people awed by the lights and fast pace of Time Square. I try not to book any hotel near this area, but to my surprise my company booked it at the Time Hotel. Hoping it was a few blocks north of Time Square, when we arrived it was right next door to it. NYC is full of hotels, but I would not reccomend staying at any chains like the W, Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, etc. It is best to venture out and try some of the great boutique hotel NYC offers, such as the Time Hotel. Although this hotel was next door to Time Square, it was actually away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Time Hotel was suprisingly in a quiet street next to two broadway shows: Spring Awakening and Chicago. Arriving in NYC, our shuttle driver dropped us off at the Crowne Plaza Hotel just to walk us a few feet to the street where the Time Hotel was located. Walking into the hotel felt like a high end boutique hotel. An elevator takes you up to the lobby where a friendly staff greeted you. We were early for check-in and could not get a room until 3 pm, as a rule with most hotels in NYC. However, we had to work that day so it wasn't an issue. The lobby at the Time is really not a lobby at all, but a BAR/CLUB as returning to the hotel that night, the music was playing loud. This would be a surprise to anyone checking in at night, especially for those not keen to hip hop music. However, our room was on the 14th floor so this was not an issue. I was amazed by the bed we ended up getting, which was a king size bed. We seem to have been upgraded free of charge or was it my Trip Advisor hat that made a difference :) Anyways, as with most boutique hotel the room was small. However, it was comfortable and clean. There was not much view, except for the room adjacent to yours where you can see everything that went on in the other room through the window (Corner Room). The bathroom was fully stock with necessities and clean. The use of storage space shaped as squares was a nice touch. They were trying GO GREEN by asking for guests to request for towels when needed and to re-use towles. However, it seem like we got new towels anyways without having to request for them. The mini-bar was expensive, as with most hotel, but well stocked. However, the fridge could only open halfway based on the layout of the room. The only negative thing I have to say about the Time Hotel is questioning how secure the room is when you are out in the city. When we left our room one morning, the cleaning lady was on our floor. Having left my umbrella in the room, I came back to find our room door open wide with no one in it. It worried me since anyone could have came in the room and stole all our belongings. However, the positive side to this story is that cameras are on each hallway to ensure safety and security of the guests. I still feel the room should have not been left alone with the door open for anyone to come in and steal something. The Time Hotel is another amazing boutique hotel offering access to all of NYC and centrally located where all the actions is happening. It is literally a few feet from Time Square where all the madness and mayhem happens. The location is definately worth it for first time visitors of NYC. Tour buses are next door and the subway (blue line) is only a block away. There is a great grocery store/deli/bakery adacent to the hotel where you can get anything and everything (The grocery store is downstair). Rockefeller Center and 5th Avenue is 3 blocks away. In conclusion, I would reccomend the hotel to any first time visitors in NYC only to be in a centralized area where all other tourist tend to meet at the point called Time Square. Don't be surprise at how small the rooms are since many boutiques hotel don't offer suites, but 1 or 2 penthouses. Be mindful that you are going for an experience and most of all just to sleep. When visiting NYC, you spend all day walking, hailing cabs, and hauling shopping bags around that by the time you get back to the hotel you are ready to go to sleep. BTW there is a restaurant downstair called Serafina, pricey, but good breakfast. I never had a glass of orange juice for $6. My friend enjoyed their bagel and lox and I enjoyed their waffle. I may have had issues with the location of this hotel, but I am glad to tell you that I did not hear one noise from the people visiting Time Square.

Needless to say, in 3-days, the room was never fixed, I couldn't switch into another room...and certainly never got the credit that I was promised. Even room service was horrible. It took three calls and 45-minutes to get a bucket of ice, and ordered dinner one night that was cold by the time it got to my room. It was really like a bad joke.

Wanted a central hotel but not too expensive. Was slightly concerned after reading the reviews, however..... Got to the Time at 1430. Was advised the room wasnt ready but wouldnt be long. 5 minutes later the bellboy took our bags and we were off to the 15th floor. As this was a special occassion I had arranged the Romance package which was a bottle of champagne, rose petals and Godiva chocolates. They had put the petals on the bedspread with the chocolates in the middle - very impressed. The room was bigger than I was expecting - bed extremly comfortable, nice bathroom, big tv. The only criticism would be the lack of storage, there was a wardrobe but no drawers. The hotel was just off times square and approx 5 minutes from times square subway. Great location. The housekeeping staff were very thorough. We loved the fact that the Do Not Disturb sign was part of the doorbell - very original. Also different to another review we thought that the fact the beds were turned down, the blinds put down and chocolate and the weather report left a really nice touch - especially for a 3 star property. We had a problem with our mini bar making a noise. We advised reception and within half hour it had been fixed, apart from that no problem at all. We used room service, thought the $5 delivery charge was a bit cheeky as this wasnt mentioned anywhere but the food was good and was with us within 15 minutes.

And to be honest, location is faultless if you're looking for all of the above: subway is five minutes away by foot, whilst Port Authority is an easy 15-minute walk. The room was ok - small but well-furnished, and the bed was incredibly comfortable - possibly the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a while. TV was ok - remote was a bit slow, and heating/AC was a bit odd: wasn't sure if it was working or not but I didn't feel too cold eventhough it was minus whatever outside. The shower was very hot as well though the bathroom was on the small side. Now the problems: the staff were ok. However, I did have a particularly non-responsive woman who didn't take kindly to my comments about the hotel cleaners being overly-efficient - they have a habit of going into your room and taking away the complimentary New York Times if it's just left on the table. I just couldn't understand why the cleaners would do that. They also have a habit of cleaning my rooms eventhough I asked them not to. But the thing which baffled me the most was why someone insisted on barging into the room late afternoon, turn on the light, the radio, and then leave two pieces of chocolate on my pillow with tomorrow's weather forecast on a small piece of paper beneath them. I have nothing against this kind of gestures - I just don't see the point, particularly when I see a sign in the hotel room urging us to save energy. By leaving the light and radio on are not environmentally friendly!! This brings me to my next point - why is there no 'Do Not Disturb' signs on the doors? My other concern was that late every Friday and Saturday night, the hotel bar is very noisy and packed, which must be a concern to those of us who need a bit of attention then because, well, the front-desk was empty. Plus the noise level is quite high. I stayed on the 9th floor so didn't hear a thing but I would worry if I lived anywhere lower. In addition, everything seems to be charged - from internet to leaving your baggage. What I hated most was having to pay $1 to make a tollfree call from my phone.

The Time was selected by the production company I was advising. It would not have been my choice as I prefer the Millenium. This is an old old hotel that was renovated as a semi-boutique hotel with a them about time. The small rooms, typical of NYC, are decorated with grey and black patterned carpeting, bright red bedspreads and wall panel behind the bed. I understand they also use green or yellow in some rooms. The place tries to be hip and cooler than thou. Living in L.A., I know the vibe but you can really only get away with it if you have great service and The Time fails in this regard. The desk staff and doormen were great. But other aspects of the hotel fall apart badly. First, maintenance problems were apparent. My first room, 1608, had an HVAC problem. Despite being in the 20s and 30s outside, the room could not be cooled down below 78-80 over a preiod of four days. Even with the windows left open, the temperature never came down. They sent a maintenance engineer to work on it. He could not fix it and suggested I leave the windows open. Try sleeping in Manhattan in the theatre district with your windows open with street noise, loud drunks and shouting clubbers on the street at all hours. The room safe also would not work, so I resorted to locking my laptop and camera in my luggage every day. Other apparent maintenance problems, wobbly toilet and seat, lights that sometimes flickered and even shocked slightly when touched. After three nights of poor sleep due to heat and noise, they moved me to another room, 1105. This one had a different thermostat system and the hvac worked well. The most apalling service problem was with room service. Because I was working extraordinarily long hours (shooting a tv show), I was often returning the hotel after 14 and 18 hour days and would just want a simple meal before bed. On the thrid night of my stay, I ordered dinner at about 8pm. The phone attendant said it should take about 40 minutes. OK. An hour later I called to check on the order as I needed to get to bed early due to an early start next day. The attendant said she forgot to enter the order so it would be another 45 minutes. Two hours after ordering, finally got the meal and went to bed an hour later than I would have liked. I mentioned this problem to the front desk. They asked if I was charged for the meal (I was) and the desk person said they would remove the charge. On the final night of my stay, after having been up for 30 hours due to a 24 hour live broadcast we did, I was way too tired to go out to eat. I ordered, was told 30-45 minutes for delivery> After an hour, I called to check and amazingly was told they had again forgotten to enter the order!! I asked for the manager and the flustered attendant told me that as they were busy he would have to call me back. Aftter not hearing back for a while, I went down to the restaurant and discussed the problem with the restaurant manager. He was apologetic and said the meal would be complimentary. Never got a call from the room service/guest services manager. That an order could be forgotten due to an error is not that big a deal - things happen. But for two orders to be lost in three days shows me that there is a serious failure in management and service personnel.

Our primary objective was to find a hotel with a good location for walking to theaters that had a room with double beds available. Since we were in New York post-Christmas and through New Year's hotel availability in the Times Square area was very limited. On the plus side, the hotel is in a good location on 49th Street just off of Broadway. Restaurants and theaters are within easy walking distance as are the yellow line subway stop and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is small and the street is relatively quiet so we were never bothered by street noise nor did we hear anything from other hotel guests. We were half a block from the BellyDelly Deli on Broadway, which made morning stops for muffins and coffee very convenient. The beds were comfortable although the pillows were the hardest I have ever seen in a hotel, despite the fact that I like firm pillows. Although we would be willing to stay here again if we were unable to find a better hotel choice, there were quite a lot of negatives especially since we were paying a high price for the hotel due to the holiday. The rooms were clean but every piece of upholstered furniture was significantly stained and ratty looking. There are no coffee pots in the rooms. The door mechanism was broken on the suite's bedroom door so that it wouldn't stay closed. The sink stopper was completely broken in the suite's bathroom so that it stayed closed all the time, and there was no stopper at all in the bathtub. None of the remote controls worked for the three flat screen TVs in the rooms, but the hotel did replace the batteries at our request and then they worked. Closet space is extremely limited even for a New York hotel. It would be sufficient for a two night stay, but not for six nights. The suite had a small dresser with six drawers but there were no drawers at all in the room with double beds. The desk staff was reasonably friendly but even after discussing the fact that we were in adjoining rooms with my mother-in-law (who checked in before we arrived), they put her in a room that didn't have an adjoining room at all, much less a suite. When we arrived and went to our room (after the desk clerk again told us that we were in adjoining rooms), we discovered that they had put us in rooms that were on different floors. We had to move my mother-in-law who had unpacked and moved into the room and there was no apology or offer to help. There was nothing terrible about this hotel but there was nothing great either.

The first indication of a problem at the Time Hotel was when I arrived around 11pm. The counters in the lobby were covered in papers, and two people were working behind them. I stepped up, and stood there for five minutes as they shuffled papers around. These papers had people's personal information on them, I noticed, which I could read. Eventually, one of the men, without looking up, asked if he could help me. I checked in and went to my room, 1202. I went to my room. There was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom, the shower door would not close completely, the floor was dirty, and it was quite warm (78F) in the room. Also, one of the reading lights for the bed was broken and held together with plastic zip ties. I discovered this when I cut my finger on the broken, jagged edge of it. I turned the A/C on and opened the windows. The climate control unit did not really seem to respond to the settings that I made on the thermostat, and even with the window open, I was only able to get it down to 73F. This was pretty warm for me. I called the front desk and they said an engineer would take care of it, which never happened. Since the shower door didn't close, water would get everywhere when I showered, which probably didn't help the mold problem on the ceiling. The shower itself was dingy, as was the rest of the bathroom, with peeling caulk everywhere. The minifridge was warm and smelled terrible inside. There was also an orange fluid dripping out of it. After two days of the hot, dirty room, I went to the front desk and complained. Christine was quite pleasant and apologized, offering to move me to another room. She gave me a room key and asked me to check it out. I went to the room and looked inside. It was much like the room I was currently in, with a couple differences. One, there was what can only be described as bodily fluids or mucus smeared on the coverlet, and a good 30-40 hairs of various lengths and varieties on the pillows and sheets. I went downstairs and asked to see another room. She gave me another key. This time, the key opened the lock, but it was locked from the inside and I heard voices from within. I went downstairs and Christine asked a bellhop to escort me to another room. I went to the room and looked around. It seemed clean and with no mold. I moved my stuff into the new room and thanked Christine for her trouble. That night was very cold and windy outside. despite the windows being closed tightly, I could feel a very cold breeze coming through them. I set the thermostat to 70F and turned the heat to high. The night seemed strangely cold. Upon waking, I discovered that the room temperature had dropped to 59F, which is pretty cold. I called the front desk and told them that I had no heat, and they apologized and said they would have an engineer look at it. When I returned home after an 18 hour day at the office, it was 58F in the room, which was colder than before! I went down to the front desk and explained that I was sick of moving around from tiny, dirty, broken room to another. The man apologized and took me to a suite, room 906. We inspected it together, and it seemed OK, if not still a little dirty. This was a nice corner suite, with a lot of windows. The bathroom had the first shower I had used where the shower curtain was long enough to prevent water from getting on the floor. The toilet was loose, and clunked from side to side when I sat on it or moved on it. The climate controls in the rooms seemed not to function at all, yet it stayed at about 70F, which was acceptable, although without the ability to turn a fan on, I still had to sleep with earplugs, as the street outside was quite noisy. About every 45 minutes there was a loud ka-chunk from something that I think was on the building right outside my room. Not sure what it was. My internet service went out in the suite while I was using it. I called the front desk, and the engineer was there in a few minutes. Such fast service on the internet but nothing for heat?!?! He tested it and made a phone call from my room to tech support. He then played with my cable box, which fixed the static on the TV, but still no internet. The next morning, my last, my bill had the charges for the internet that didn't work and a phone charge for when the engineer made the call from my room. I called the front desk and asked them to fix it. I came back from breakfast and checked out. The bill had not been corrected. I tried to explain it, but they didn't seem to understand, as they had already reversed a double-charge for internet when I had moved rooms the first time. Finally, they understood and adjusted the bill. I would never, ever, ever, ever, stay at the Time Hotel again. It is dirty, unpleasant, broken, and not worth your time or money. Every fixture and piece of furniture is splattered in paint from hasty repainting jobs. Light switches are broken. Things are poorly thought out, such as the closets whose hangar bars stick out, but not far enough to actually access anything but the first item on the bar.

We also stayed at the Hotel Chandler, also a small boutique hotel and one that it has to be said totally outclassed this one. LOCATION: Superb, right next to TImes Square and all the hustle and bustle. HOTEL: Swanky and shiny. Modern. SERVICE: Arrogant. The atmosphere was cliquey and had an air of \"you are lucky to be staying here.\" We had one reason to call reception which was being unable to get any channels on our very flash plasma screen. No-one ever turned up to sort it out, and we found out in the moning when we found a lump in the bed that there was in fact a seperate cable remote. Someone could have pointed out that there were two remotes when we called with the problem. ROOM: This is where the problems are. It was TINY - I know all Manhattan rooms are small but these really are, and they are poorly designed. Everything looks too big for the room, especially the plasma screen. Indeed it is nice to have a Bose Waveradio to play with, but it took up nearly all of the bedside table, leaving no room for the phone, which was shoved on length-ways. Petty I know but it made an incredibly small room look untidy before you rolled your suitcase in. The room just said \"crashpad\" and not \"boutique hotel room.\" The bathroom was nice and very clean,and actually seemd quite spacious compared to the room itself. There were Molton Brown toiletries as I recall which is always nice. BAR: Very shiny and sex in the city, with expensive but reasonably well made and strong cocktailsl. Very quiet though even on Friday night. Loud hip-hop playing (DJ) but no dancing. RESTAURANT: We had a superb meal, and being our last night, pushed the boat out and had oysters, cocktails and some awesome red wine, on which we spent twice what we had intended (very good friendly waitress had polished sales skills!) Although very well cooked everything was rather heavily salted - but we are quite fussy foodie types and the meal was still excellent. OVERALL: There's nothing hear to worry about and it is a funky, central place, but it just didn't feel like true quality behind the pretentiousness.

I had read some of the reviews and was a little wary about the level of service. However, we were met at the door by a great doorman who took care of all our baggage and directed to reception to be met with equally friendly and efficient staff who processed us very quickly and within a few minutes of arriving we were in our room with the baggage delivered. Again the bellman who delivered the bags was very helpful and answered any questions we had. The room wasn't huge, but in New York none of them are, but it was fairly well appointed, and the nice touches such as the Bose radio are very good. The bathroom was small also, and the only problem I found in there was that the shower leaked somewhat and needed towels down to soak up the water. We didnt bother complaining about this as it wasnt so bad as to affect our holiday and we just put down used towels to soak up the water. The nice cosmetics provided were good. If I did have to put down one complaint it would be regarding housekeeping. On at least 2 of the 6 mornings we were staying there they knocked the door to come in, despite us having turned on the 'do not disturb' sign. Even on the other mornings housekeeping were extremely loud in doing their business and we could hear them talking loudly and banging doors. Maybe we should have got up a little earlier, but I didnt feel it was so late that they should be making the noise they were. Also one evening there was a disturbance outside the door with people talking 'very' loudly into walkie-talkies - after a little panic, wondering was the hotel being evacuated we discovered it was housekeeping again, just checking if everything was ok. I asked for some more towels as there had only been 3 left that day and I wanted another. The person obviously didnt speak english so i pointed to a towel and was told that one would be coming, however none arrived. The problems with the housekeeping though were minor enough not to have affected our stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location and I would recommend to anyone else going to New York. Its really only 2 minutes from Times Square and close to anywhere you'd want to go. I was also pleasantly surprised at the prices in the mini-bar, we bought several items, and a beer was only a few dollars and other snacks were cheap.

Likewise, the front desk was hectic and confusing like a youth hostel opposed to a boutique hotel. Some of these small problems could be fixed with better management, but the positives of the hotel far outweighed the negatives. The Time is a boutique hotel and as such, they get the most important aspects right. Many of the previous reviews were critical of the small rooms. Noting that, we stayed in a king size deluxe room which wasn't large, but was roomy. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on - and I'm a frequent traveller. And the large flat screen t.v. placed on the wall in front of the bed actually made the smaller room more pleasurable for snuggling with my wife and watching television. Finally, the shower and toiletries were excellent. Above all, the room was very clean and functional.

Can you imagine that we had to comb the streets of new york looking like zombies?? The receptionist was not helpful at all. The hotel was not well kept. The carpets (along the corridor and room) and the place just look OLD! When we finally got the room, it was not the colour theme that we had requested for (if they can't get this right, why bother to ask us in the first place when we did our booking?). But that was the last thing on our mind since we were both dead tired. The first impression of the room was BAD! Carpet is dirty (I wonder how often do they vacuum clean the carpet!). Necessities such as the bedroom slippers are also missing. The toilet door is faulty. The sheets are not even neatly pressed. The gym is pathetic! The treadmill's really old and they have limited equipments. It's okay if you just want a quick cardio exercise and get out of the tiny room or gym . Don't bother about the in-house breakfast! It's US$15 for a continental breakfast... way too pricey. Thank goodness, we didn't pay for the over-priced meal. My recommendation is try the deli around the area. Starbucks, Food Empire and McDonald's are just round the corner. I wonder how on earth does the hotel justify its rates?? There are better hotels in that area. The only consolation is that the hotel is located in a prime area and is near to the subway. The asian doorman is really helpful and friendly (the rest of the staff does not even know what does good service entail). Frankly, the review would have been better if the room rates were at 3-star prices (or even 2-star). Unfortunately, it's not the case. Having stayed at better hotels around the world, the Time DOES NOT offer good value for money. We will defnitely not return to this hotel. A hip hotel?

Our three night stay at The Time Hotel was a highlight of our trip. I have traveled widely and stayed at every level of hotel imaginable , but I can't recall being more surprised by the hospitality and kindness of a staff of people in the service industry then what we encountered at the Time. I had never heard of The Time until I ran into a wInter promotion deal they were running and did the necessary research and found the hotel to be intriguing, so we booked a King room for around $200.00 a night. While scanning other reviews, I was struck by the description of the hotel as eclectic, funky , and hip as well as the many references to the staff as being stiff, rude , or reserved. My experience was , yes the hotel is quirky as has been noted in previous reviews, but the staff was outstanding from the doormen to bellmen, front desk personnel to maid staff, from managers to bar staff. These people could not have been more welcoming or willing to please. An example. I drove into Manhattan on a Wednesday afternoon, found the Time, was greeted by the doorman who helped us unload our car , and then directed me to the parking garage across the street. While I attempted to park , my wife and our baggage were taken to the second floor reception area waiting my arrival. One problem, being a Wed. afternoon, the parking garages were filled with theater goer's cars for the matinees . Every parking garage in a two to three block area was filled, and as I proceeded to ride around the block for about twenty minutes the staff of The Time and my wife were becoming concerned for my whereabouts. Eventually , two of the staff were out on the street trying to wave me down to sit my car until a spot opened up. However, just as I pulled around for the third or fourth time I spotted a car leaving from across the street and secured a parking slot. On my arrival at the hotel, all were relieved I had survived my first adventure in the city. But I was really struck by the caring attitude the staff showed to me and my wife. As the week proceeded the staff would demonstrate this same attitude in a myriad of ways. They all enjoy their jobs and it showed.

We had to open it up ourselves to discover that the thin and sagging mattress had no bedding on it. We called housekeeping to have the bed made up. After several rings, the phone eventually went to the front desk. Someone from the hotel staff, but not housekeeping, eventually arrived with two sheets. He was very nice and did his best, but didn't bring a comforter or blanket. He said he would bring one, but then a different and considerably less friendly man brought a blanket that was filthy and had several holes in it. when we unfolded it. We called downstairs again for a replacement blanket and got one in about the same condition. The night reception desk man told us this wasn't his problem in that he was not housekeeping. We told him we wanted to speak to the hotel manager the next day but the manager never contacted us. Also, we wanted to have a quiet drink in the hotel before going to bed that evening. Although we had been told that the lounge would be open until 2am, the hotel turned the lounge into a night club on Friday night, with music so loud you could barely hear the rude man at reception, which was on the same floor. The restaurant downstairs was closed by 11pm on a Friday night, but they suggested we go out again and try a bar a few blocks away. We ended up using the mini bar in the room. Be forewarned that the hotel uses some strange system that charges you each time you remove an item from the floor level minibar refrigerator. Also, there were only two glasses in the entire suite. Obviously, we weren't calling housekeeping for another glass that night! Also, there was no coffee maker in the room, and the TV in the living room wouldn't change channels or turn off after we turned it on on Sunday morning. The very nice day staff at the front desk removed the excess mini bar charges and said it was a constant problem, but our complaints about the difficulties we had with the night staff were not addressed beyond a very sincere and friendly sorry. I travel a lot, and while the Time wasn't the worst place I've ever stayed, it would take one heck of a low rate to get me to consider giving them another chance. If I did ever end up there again, I would scour the room for problems at check in and plan to spend a couple of hours getting them straightened out while the day staff is still around.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cSmelly + Noisy!\u201d", "Author": "Fredflint", "ReviewID": "UR6509294", "Content": "Arrived at hotel to be greeted by friendly, efficient + helpful staff.

Service: Upon our arrival, the desk guy seemed a bit preoccupied at first but eventually checked us in.

The next morning, despite arriving late we were allowed to sit for breakfast in the hotel restaurant/ lounge (which was ok, however i would recommend nearby french bistro Pigalle on 8th). Rooms: Our first night was in the Penthouse. Overwhelming at first, the room is 3 levels and equipped w/ bar, sauna, two bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs, exterior terrace on two levels and plasma tv's everywhere. Although very nice, it seemed a bit beat up in some areas and mechanical noises could be heard throughout the night coming from next door. Also, the lighting is tricky. The standard king room was NY small but clean and well equipped w/ refrigerator, comfy bed and enough towels to dry you for a week. The bathroom was also small but clean and nicely fitted with modern fixtures, shelves and magazines for those who like to read in there. Cons: Im all for cool design elements, but the fancy light dimmers in both rooms were at times difficult to operate. The only full length mirror is inside the cramped bathroom and guests have to step out to the mirrored elevator area to fully check themselves out. The Time was a very nice stay.

I think I have stayed in the majority of NYC hotels that bill themselves as 4 & 5 stars. I have never before been tempted to write a review, mostly because my experiences ranged from good to outstanding. This time, I just can't help myself. I arrived this past Sunday and was greeted at the desk by a woman who could not be bothered to look up from whatever it was she was doing. I stood there for a few minutes until she finally acknowledge me by snipping, \"just wait a minute.\" I did. And then 5 more. Eventually she spoke to me, found my reservation, ignored all my questions -- she literally did not respond to simple inquiries like \"where is the elevator?\" -- and handed me the keys to Room 1416. Now I knew the room was going to be small, but small combined with dingy and dark does not begin to capture the gloom that awaited me in the (open) security-gate-windowed nightmare. The first thing that came to mind was the scene in the movie \"Big\" when Tom Hank's and his friend walk into the flop house room that he has been forced to take because he could not go home suffering from his newly-minted grown-up condition. I tried to turn on the overhead light only to discover that the switch was broken. When I called down to ask to have someone come up and take a look, the woman who answered could not have been nastier; I decided that rather than dealing with her, I would rely on the two lamps on either side of the bed. (I can't actually report if the overhead light would have worked if I managed to get some current to it.) I took the two steps from the door to the bathroom to discover that the bathroom door knob was detached. Managing to make it past that obstacle, I tried to turn on the sink to find myself holding whatever it is you call the thing that lets the water flow. The sink faucet leaned sharply to the left, which was amusing more than anything else. (I had to wait until Monday AM to find out that the tub did not drain.) The sink itself was separating from the wall leaving that nice black filth that tends to fill up spaces like this. Did I mention the badly stained carpet? How about the depressing hallways? On second thought, never mind. On the bright side, there were plenty of towels. This can all be yours for the low-low price of $350+ a night!

I usually fly into/out of LaGuardia as it is closer to midtown and always stay in the Time Square-Columbus Circle Area. I chose the Time based on good reviews here and fo the same price as other hotels in the area, I booked a 1 bedroom suite so I can have more space as NYC in general offers tiny rooms. NYC trademark yellow cab dropped us off at The Time's glass canopy entrance on 49th Street and a doorman took our bags up the glass elevator to the second floor reception area. Our first impression was that the Reception area was small and minimal to the point of being styrile and cold. We have previously stayed at other \"designer/boutique\" hotels (Paramount and Hudson) whose lobbies are ambient with lots of good energy. The Time lacked this feeling. Upon arrival, the check-in staff were robotic and performed their tasks, but offered zero personality or warmth. The bellman took us up to our room and briefly showed us around. On looking around our two-parlour suite, we never got the WOW factor as we did at Hudson or Paramount on previous stays. The Living Room was stark and cold. The Bedroom was in Blue (one o f the primary colours offered-but we were never given the choice to choose) Our opinion about the first impression of the room is: The Designer tried but \"missed\" we felt disappointed about our hotel selection. First night our sheets were \"loud\" to the point where I had to leave a note for house-keeping the next day to supply softer bedding as ours was starched to \"thy kingdom come\" . Street noise was noticable from as early as 4am with trash collection trucks. No attempt was made by the designer to use noice reducing windows or glass and I understand it is a city, but there are other options. Our first morning I visited the concierge to arrange certain reservations and/or meal recommendations. Our concierge was the most dreary individual. Did not seem connected to the city in any way. I asked about relatively new restaurants I had heard about and he was clueless. Of the restaurants he recommended nearby, I knew them already and won't consider them a place I would revisit. I stuck with my original pre-planned restaurant visits from research I did online at \"gayot\" and \"nymag\" and made reservations prior to my NYC arrival via opentable's website. The only useful thing the concierge was good for was to hand me a map of the city. He was the only one I ever saw for the duration of our stay at the Concierge Desk. We also secured excellent seats at the last minute via ticketmaster for the Broadway show \"Wicked\" at the Gershwin Theatre starring Ana Gasteyer. It was fantastic as were our seats 9 rows from Centre Stage. The hotel offers a basic (hot) breakfast off the lobby in the lounge (not the dining room). It was basically a fold open table, a white table cloth, three food warmers one with dried bacon, one with greasy sausages and the other with soggy hash browns. There was also a limited selection of fruit and baked goods. A server eventaully appeared from the kitchen and brought coffee and offered an egg, done to our taste. As I signed the cheque for 39.00 for breakfast for two, I felt this lame breakfast and the high cost of the room (478.00) should have been a complimentary feature. For breakfast, either go to any coffee shop nearby such as Cafe Europa or to Balthazar. Our overall hotel experience was disappointing. I would not stay here again as the are much better options available who offer the full New York City Experience of style and sophistication while providing charisma and comfort in their rooms. So for the hotel I say TIME OUT. Other than checking in and checking out we never encountered other staff and when we tried we got the dreary concierge (sounds like a new broadway play: \"the Dreary Concierge-a comedy) The hotel's decor is stark and cold and has zero personality. Accoustically, you hear all the chatter between staff. We shared elevators many times with service staff clearing bags of laundry and trash. Anyone can enter the lobby and take the elevator directly to the floors of the guest rooms. This seemed to be a security risk. The doorman was not there many times of my ins and outs and anyone could have followed me in. The doorman was always pre-occupied chatting with his mates, colleagues or people in the street and often did not even acknowledge the people were entering the hotel. This bothered me a great deal. We certainly do NOT recommend this hotel for your NYC experience. We consider ourselves well travelled and in the 36-40yr old age group and we like the WOW factor, value for money, service, personality and comfort. This hotel failed at offering this to us. We did get this from other NYC experiences on this trip. For example we ate dinner at The Buddha Bar which opened in the Meat Packing district in April. Excellent food and service was great. Got the WOW here. Also try Buddhakhan, which the concierge had no clue about. The best dinner we had was at Kittichai located at the fabulous 60 Thompson in Soho. The intimate Dining room exuded a overall feeling of well-being and the meal was fantastic. Cant wait to go back. For lunch try Spice Market, L'ecole, and Balthazar So my short list for NYC is: *Fly into LGA-LaGuardia or Newark if you can *Use a NYC Cab and not a private taxi *Choose a hotel from: Paramount/Hudson/the Maritime or 60 Thompson (new hotel soon to be opened at 6 COLUMBUS too) *Breakfast at Belthazar (french) or Cafe Europa (economy) *Lunch at Spice Market, L'ecole (at the French Culinary Institute) or Gramercy Tavern *Dinnert at Budda Bar, Tao, Buddhakhan and definitely at Kittichai and maybe SUBA....to go more up-market try Per Se or Danube *Broadway shows: Wicked/The Chorus Line and Buckley (with Nathan Lane) Hairspray was fantastic when I say it with Harvey Fierstein (spelling??)

The Time is a perfectly fine place to rest your head. Our room on the 7th Floor had not yet been redecorated, but was in fine shape. Yes, the rooms are small - but no smaller than some of the cabins I've stayed at aboard various cruise ships. Much like those rooms, The Time tries to compensate for the lack of space with some fairly well thought-out storage nooks. The bathroom is definitely small. It took a while for the water to heat up, and the pressure was not what I am accustomed to, but the shower stall was roomy enough and in spite of what some previous reviews say, there -are- shower curtains, so you -won't- be splashing water all over the place! The Moulton Brown amenities are a nice touch, too. The hotel staff was cordial and most attentive - not stand-offish like others have reported. The restaurant is not serving dinner these days, but a light (and very limited!) menu can be had in the bar. The bar was actually rather dead, too - which is a shame, since it's a great-looking room and the staff seemed to be rather bored. That's not to say they weren't attentive - but I hope some of you who will be staying there will pop on in and give them some business - they deserve it.

If you've got tickets to a show, this is an ideal place to hang your hat - and price-wise, it (normally) can't be beat. I'd check out the hotel's website to see what deals they are offering: we were able to get a much better rate through the hotel than through some of the other online sites. There are more expensive hotels in New York - and there are certainly other hotels who \"out-boutique\" the Time - but at twice (or thrice!) the cost. If you're looking to hang out with celebutantes - look elsewhere - but if saving money while staying in a room @ a centrally-located hotel that's slightly edgier than most of the others, you'll be perfectly happy here.

Dear Ms. Lewis -- As a repeat customer of the Time hotel, I was very surprised this week to receive treatment radically different from what I have grown accustomed to at the hands of your staff. When I arrived at 10:45pm on Tuesday, February 28th (after depositing my luggage at 2pm that day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room was not ready yet), I was given room 610, whose HVAC unit only produced heat. An engineer was called to the room, and after 10 minutes of adjustments, he said he would be back in 15 minutes to check to see if it was OK. Due to the late hour, I asked to change rooms. The desk associate moved me to the 8th floor, in a room with the exact same problem. I was then asked to look at another room on the 8th floor, which was clearly a smoking room. Finally, at about 11:30, I was placed in room 1615, a notable downgrade. The next morning, I packed up my things and left for the day, telling the morning desk associate that I was expecting to be placed in a deluxe room (my original room grade) with a working HVAC unit. When I arrived at the hotel at 8:30pm, I was shocked to be handed a key to room 610 once again. After I explained that this was the original problematic room, the desk associate informed me that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel was overbooked,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the only rooms left at that point were smoking rooms. After I asserted that they had had all day to fix this, the manager on duty came out, and without ever addressing me, begrudgingly told the desk associate to put me in room 612, a suite. The final insult came when I went to check out and the bill still reflected the deluxe room rate for Tuesday night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had to press to get Eddie (manager on duty) to revise it. If the associate on duty the night of 2/28 had placed me in the suite instead of the downgrade after the 3rd room change, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like an undervalued customer right now. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all it would have taken. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have had to stay in a shoe box with a cracked sink on 2/28 after a long day of meetings (inconvenience #1), pack up again the next morning (inconvenience #2), argue again at the front desk on 3/1 (inconvenience #3), and fight about my bill at departure (inconvenience #4). The additional irony of all of this is that on my last stay in December, I had complimented the manager on duty, since I had noticed a big improvement in service and attitude from both the desk staff and the bell/front door staff (I recall that I even took the time to send in a positive comments card).

The bathroom is small but with enough space to do what you need to do.The bath products are fantastic and you can buy larger products to take home.(They also sell the same products at Bloomingdales!)I do advise to take a sponge or puff to wash with because they give you a body wash and would be eaiser to wash if you had the sponge or puff.Towels were very good. The best part of this hotel is how close it is to Times Square.You can just about roll out of bed and walk out the door and your steps away from Times Square and the theatres.When we stayed at the other hotel it was such along walk to Times Square we kept taking taxi's and went back early,but being so close you can stay out late.Also if you need a taxi, they go right by the hotel so getting one is a snap or shall I save a wave!

There is a small fridge in the room but dont remove item to look at because you will be charged.(like other mini bars around)There is a small space that you can put water or drinks of your own.If you need ice, you have to call the front desk and it will be brought right up to you!

Unfortunately, while they try carry this hip ambience into the guestrooms, they don't quite succeed. The guest rooms are about average size for Manhattan, which is to say small - though not oppressively so. The furnishings are generally unimpressive and look a little worse for wear. The bathroom, in particular, far from being a spa-like setting, is simply a typical three-star Holiday Inn or Hyatt bathroom with a more modern faucet. This is not to say the place is a dump. It isn't. In fact, the room itself was perfectly clean and the bed and linens tremendously comfortable. However, if you're expecting a luxurious day-spa type setting, you won't find it here. This is a plain hotel with panache that ends at the reception desk. On the other hand, if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive place that offers clean, comfortable rooms, this is an excellent choice. The rooms are also quiet.

The room was great. We had a Blue Room with two double beds. Yes, a little snug, but certainly not cramped. There was plenty of room to set up the ironing board. There were two hanging rods and three shelves for folded-clothing storage (which, upon arrival, actually held the bed pillows). There was the standard TV with a pretty good selection of channels. We didn't try the wireless, which was $9.95 per 24 hours (billed noon to noon). We had drinks at the bar that night, which was loud but not too raucous. The bartender was great; when I was dismayed that my favorite drink was not on the menu, he asked what the ingredients were and made it for me. Very comfy seating in the bar, too... cushy armchairs and couches. There's an area in back that's a bit more funky, with color-changing lights in the ceiling; that seemed to be where the real partying was going on. The room was very quiet; we never heard anything from other rooms aside from hearing doors closing every now and then. There was a New York Times at our door each morning. The bathroom had two very fluffy bathrobes which were generously sized. The only problem with the bathroom was that the shower curtain was about two inches too short, and that would cause puddles on the main bathroom floor. Also, the tiles in the shower are on the slippery side; you can request a non-slip shower mat from the front desk. I'd recommend it.

And hears a tip...I found the best price on the Time's own web site. Also, (thanks to the great lady at the Time who answered the phone) you can put the room color you want in the comments section. I asked for a red room on the 5-10th floor (others said the lower rooms were too close to the lounge) and we got a red room on the 7th floor. Now that's service. Perhaps the end of March is an off time, but we NEVER had a problem waiting for an elevator...heck they even have little TV's in the wall near the elevators to help pass the time....so cool. Their concierge was also great. We wanted to go to Korea Town in Flushing to buy a specific Korean dress, but not being from NY, didn't know exactly where it was. The concierge didn't know off hand (who would), but he called back very fast (5-10 min) with an address, and subway directions...and he was exactly right. We couldn't have done it without him. Thank you! And I must add that I can't stand all the reviews that say it isn't worth it for the price. For the location, and trendiness, its one of the cheapest hotels I found on TimeSquare. I paided $209 for a king room. Most other hotels started at $250, and ended way, way up there. On our last day, they even held our bags so we could see some more sites until we left the city late in the day. I can honestly say I'll be staying there again the next time I'm in the Big Apple.", "Date": "April 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maplewood, MN", "Title": "\u201cSkip It\u201d", "Author": "RichardP21", "ReviewID": "UR3317247", "Content": "Our reservation was for a king size bed.

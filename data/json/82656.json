I'm a crazy light sleeper and the Hilgard House gave me a perfect night's sleep. My room had a white noise machine and the big bay window gave onto the side of the building, rather than the somewhat busy Hilgard Avenue. The hotel is small enough (roughly 10 rooms per floor?) that people aren't coming and going very often. I never heard people staying in rooms on either side of, or below, me. Lots of other perks to recommend the Hilgard House: * Front desk staff were helpful, knowledegable, and kind, but inobtrusive. * Free wireless is a nice bonus - at other hotels, I feel gouged paying for this product when they could share it with their patrons so easily; not so at Hilgard House. * Parking is secure and easy. * Westwood is walkable - I found a Ralph's nearby handy; great pizza down the street; the bar at the W across the street has a cheap happy hour. The other patrons who remark on the low shower heads are right - this feature is an odd one.

The location is terrific and the staff friendly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a quiet, mainly residential area a couple of blocks from UCLA. The botanical garden is only a block away. Across the street from the hotel is fabulous and expensive W Hotel. Within a short walking distance, there are restaurants, shops, and movies. ALSO free parking! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rare thing in L.A. The Hilgard House is a older hotel. It seems to me that it may have been built in the 1940 or possibly a bit earlier. I read a review saying it was similar to some old, small European hotel, and I agree with that assessment. There is a lot of dark wood veneer that is a bit shabby. The rooms have been updated but they are not completely modern. This is both good and bad. The room I was in had a window seat and a view onto the grounds of the church next door. The view was green and very pretty. However, the outside of the windows were dusty and that spoiled the view a little. The room decor could use some updating with a new bedspread and furniture. However, the bed was comfortable, and the pillows were too \u00e2\u20ac\u201d not too soft and not too hard. The TV looked great. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wall mounted flat screen. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch it, but it looked as if it would be nice. The bathroom is small and has a low shower head. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21227\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and it was low for me. The tub appeared to be new and it was a spacious oval shape. There are double sinks so someone could be outside the bathroom and still be getting ready. There was also a refrigerator in the foyer area of the room. So, to sum it up, the hotel is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but it is in and near a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area of L.A. Everything is very convenient. I was visiting the Getty Museum, and it was an easy 10 or 15 minute drive away. I do need to add that I visited during a university holiday, so the area may be busier with traffic when school is in session. As it was, I could sleep with the window open and not be disturbed by the noise.

Once in the room, we were really disappointed because the floors had not been \"cleaned\" ...There were dried old spills and spot marks all over the entry and bathroom floors. The bathroom smelled like a urinal and it seemed \"wiped\" down. There was a small fridge which was not keeping our child's medicine cold and when we opened the door, the floor around the fridge was filthy. It was as if the fridge had been further away from the wall and was never cleaned underneath... then was pushed back to the wall to reveal old spills and poor mopping. Very gross. We had to be moved to the only available room which was a suite at $199 a night. At first glance again it seemed okay. The sofas were badly stained and the carpet filthy around it. Everything needed to cleaned. The counters and dining table left the wash cloth so dirty we couldn't wash it out with soap. We took a photo of it, because it bothered us so much we wanted to tell the manager. We didn't so much care that the patio was uninviting because we were more concerned with caring for our five year old. I found the accommodations inexcusably uncomfortably dirty. A little dust we can deal with... dirty, no. Just an irritant was the WiFi was continually out and needed resetting. This place could be great if it was better kept. The walls have hand prints and the whole place needs a good cleaning and makeover.

But you can start in the lobby and then move on to one of the coffee shops nearby if you want more! I was somewhat surprised to discover how good the bus services to and from UCLA are.

Previously, we'd stayed at the W, just across the street, and paid far more for a room, as well as with time for the valet parking and all the rigamarole related to getting the car and getting out of the W where all kinds of activities and hullabaloo, -- while fine for an experience -- tend to interfere with the simple business of trying to blend into Westwood Village life. At Hilgard House we parked our rental in the garage every night and took the elevator up to our floor. Our delightful ultra-clean room (cleaned quickly every morning by friendly and attentive staff) faced the back of the Westwood Christian Church, a truly beautiful and historic structure visible from our large picture window. Church bells never chimed before 10, but were lovely to the ear. The lobby bowl of fruit, particularly my mandatory bananas, was alway full, with coffee available. We enjoyed a quick daily trek to the Starbucks or Coffe Bean to start the day, but it was nice to be able to grab a paper if desired in the gem of a lobby. The location and proximity to everything village-wise encouraged walking. It was fun to lunch at Whole Foods or Angelino's or just shop fabulous Westwood (including superb jeweler Michael K's), as well as wander across the street to the W for a nightcap when the mood struck. Make no mistake -- the owners of this venue are international hoteliers who have created a chic oasis that has no need of advertising.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "the road", "Title": "\u201cDelightful and dusty, great location\u201d", "Author": "09876", "ReviewID": "UR6095057", "Content": "We found Hilgard House through a websearch when we needed a place for the night close to UCLA. We were quite delighted with it. It has the atmosphere of a little European B&B. The decor feels like someone's mansion - pretty, in excellent taste, imperfect, maybe a bit dusty. Marble floors and granite counters in the bathrooms, tubs bigger than usual for hotels. The staff are friendly and pleasant. Breakfast is free. There's coffee in the lobby all day. There are soda and junkfood machines in the garage. Parking is free, too. Free wifi internet that was easy to access and didn't crash. There was a fridge in one room, an ice-maker in the other. We got a reasonable price - $164 with taxes. It's just off campus, near the Medical Center - walking distance. The location feels pretty safe. All the rooms are upstairs, and entrance is through a lobby which is staffed all the time. Of course there are negatives. There was dust in the tub and on the aircon, which was one of the old-fashioned type near the window. A standard lamp was broken (I think because they put in a heavy energy-saver bulb and the fixture couldn't take the extra weight). There's no desk; the bedside table doubles as one. The upholstered chair had stains on it. There was no free socket near the bed; I had to unplug the clock. All these were trivial. I would happily stay there again.

If you do not want or need anything other than comfortable accomodations, then this is the place for you. There is no pool, business center, fitness center, restaurant or lounge. There is, however, free parking (not for large SUV's or trucks), free continental breakfast , refrigerator in room , several premium cable channels on TV. Rooms have large bay windows with window seats. Staff is friendly. The area is safe and there are plenty of restaurants , cinemas, and shops in Westwood. Ralphs grocery store is just across the street. Also the Geffen Playhouse, where we saw the oustanding play \"Rabbit Hole\" during our visit. Note that the gate to the underground parking area is closed at night, so check if you plan to stay out late with your car. Across the street is the W Los Angeles Hotel. I stayed there once in years past. It is a very different place--more urban, loud, contemporary, stylish, with a see-and-be-seen pool area and lounge. More for younger folks--they had a velvet rope front entrance situation while we were there.

They did everything they could to make sure everyone's stay was positive and situated our large group in a convenient location.

The manager literally yelled at me in the parking garage in front of other guests. He was pointing his finger at me and shaking his finger at me. When I asked where I could stay or where the Ralph's is (being I'm not from the area I had no idea where the Ralph's was located) he became irrate and mocked and mimicked me \"ohh, the poor baby, she doesn't know where to go\", \"poor thing\", etc. After my encounter with this \"man\", I didn't feel safe staying there. Luckily another local hotel had a cancellation and welcomed me and my truck without any problems. The desk clerk (young gentleman) appologized profusely for the manager's behavior and stated that we would have been able to handle the situation without the manager's involvement. I have filed a complaint with The Los Angeles Area Hotel Association and I will also be contacting the Chamber of Commerce. Since so many people drive large SUV's and trucks, they should mention the parking situation when people make reservations over the phone.

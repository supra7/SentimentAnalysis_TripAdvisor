The restaurant was just OK for food, but when I needed change for a $10 I stopped into the restaurant to see if they could help. They said they were low on change themselves and couldn't help, but one of the waiters pulled out his wallet and broke my $10 for me which I felt was going above and beyond and I was also impressed by! The only \"negative\" thing I would say that I didn't really like about the stay was the beds. They were very clean and well made, but I found the mattress to be a bit firmer than I prefer.

The complaints I have are that the blankets are thin. I would have thought for a hotel which has nightly rate of ~$300 it would have a nice fluffy comforter. We are talking about Boston, a bit up north, not Miami down south where it's VERY warm. I had to take the extra blanket from the closet (and thank goodness there is one) to use. Yes, one can turn on the heat, but the heater makes noise and that doesn't help with falling asleep. The second compalint is that whoever the hotel hired to reglaze the bathtub didn't do a good job. It was one of those older style cast iron tub with porceline enamel. The enamel had chipped off quite a bit and the tub looked like it was very dirty. But it wasn't dirt, it was just the enamel came off the tub. The shower water fixture came off when I tried to turn the water on, but I was able to put it back and use the shower. I did leave my comments on the Best WEstern Guest Comment card. I hope management had taken care of the problems.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cyou have to be kidding me\u201d", "Author": "100nightsayear_sea", "ReviewID": "UR83413715", "Content": "I was forced to stay here because the city was essentially sold out.

However, since the hotel seems to think they are worth $200 per night, I feel that I must speak out about the quality for your dollar. In fact, I feel the hotel is blatantly taking advantage of the fact that there are very few hotels in the nearby area. Someone PLEASE open a nicer hotel nearby. You would gladly have my business!! I travelled to Boston on business, and as I was attending a meeting at the Harvard Medical school conference center, the Best Western at Longwood was recommended to me. Overall, my impression of this hotel is poor. The staff were very unhelpful (although the concierge was quite charming). When I had no warm water for a shower, I was told they were working on a valve and that there was no good time to do this and it had to be done. My thoughts were, \"Why on EARTH would 9 am when many guests are taking their morning showers be the appropriate time?!?!\" Couldn't it have waited until later in the afternoon??? Beyond that, the hotel is a bit dated and the staff misinformed. I found that I was often given wrong information concerning tour times and given wrong directions to nearby areas. Although I had no trouble with crime in the area, the doors do have rather large signs warning the guest to make sure they can see all callers at the door, which leads me to believe that they have had trouble in the past. I will mention a few pros. The hotel offers free wifi and is in an excellent location: walking distance to Fenway, Harvard medical, and the Longwood medical area. Despite these positives, I cannot in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone. As I stated previously, if the price somehow matched the quality of my stay, I would not be complaining. I cannot see how this Best Western can justify their price. It actually ANGERS me as it appears they are taking advantage of persons who need to stay in the Longwood area for medical appointments. Since there are few other choices, I have to imagine this hotel charges a four star price for the area alone. However, it would be nice if they tried to at least live up to this four star price.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ledyard, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cABOVE AND BEYOND\u201d", "Author": "ledyardbball", "ReviewID": "UR81524670", "Content": "Bryan at the inn went above and beyond to help myself and my daughter to book a room at their hotel.

During our last two emergency hospital stays, the inn had no vacancies, but thanks to the caring management and staff we were finally able to get a room. The first time their desk clerk, Amy, (with the help of the manager, Bill Davies) managed to make a room available for us despite their being full to the brim. Then just last week we were again faced with the \"no room at the inn\" situation and about to give up. The manager, Bill Davies, went above and beyond when he heard of our predicament. We were just about to give up late at night (after checking back frequently during the day for availability) when he raced after us with the good news that there had been a cancellation and he had saved a room for us.

One is that there were some noticeable holes in one of the walls which just need a little spackle. Another is that there was a teeny bit of mold/mildew in between the shower tiles, and the shower curtain could have been a little cleaner.

It was a bit misleading. The hotel is difficult to find, considering that it sits in and atop the Galleria (not a mall, despite the name) among several medical facilities and colleges. We passed it and had to turn around - a complicated proposition considering the volume of foot traffic in the area. The traffic signals are slow and pedestrians (mostly medical school students in a hurry) pretty much ignore them, creating a major driving hassle. We parked in the garage adjacent to the hotel, which costs $18/day. The spaces are small and some valet service also uses the garage - double parking all over the place, creating another headache. Front desk staff was minimal and we ended up waiting for our parking voucher every time we came and went. That's the \"Bad.\" The Good? The room had a great layout and was spacious. It included a table, desk, microwave, fridge, sink (basically a small kitchenette), and a whole wall of windows. (The windows faced apartment windows, which was a bit disconcerting - imagine looking out and seeing a man changing his clothes in his bedroom not 50 feet away.) The location was great for walking - much to see and plenty of restaurants to choose from. As a matter of fact, the Galleria food court is literally an elevator ride away. There, we could choose from a variety of quick meals - Mexican, Chinese, american, subs, sushi, soup, coffee, smoothies, even Dairy Queen and McDonalds. The ugly? Unfortunately there was an ugly. The toilet was unstable and filled inconsistently. The shower never stopped dripping and had a slow (extremely slow) drain. My ten minute shower practically turned into a bath. The bathroom sink had a problem with uneven water pressure. The lighting in the room was inadequate - four lamps with dim bulbs did not provide enough light, and opening the curtains was not much help since the hotel is in the shadows of tall hospital buildings. The door was challenging to close and latch, and I found the single chain lock (no deadbolt) to be insufficient. On an odd note, the hotel has framed photography on display and for sale in the lobby, yet when we inquired about purchasing a piece (which was a fundraiser for the adjacent hospital, by the way), no one knew how to sell it to us. We left without the piece. Why display prices and post information about the fundraiser, and then be unable to sell the pieces? Disappointing.

PARKING CAUTION !--be aware of how you will use parking! Indoor lot adjacent to Inn is very convenient & the lowest flat rate that can be obtained in area. HOWEVER, if you pay the Inn for parking there, you will pay $18/day-- but the garage itself only charges $17/day max (provided that you do not leave lot & return).ALSO, Inn stops your parking day at noon, no matter what time you checked in the day before, so you will have to pay extra cash to the garage if you leave after noon. For example, we stayed 3 nights--parked in the garage for 70 hours without moving car because we walked 1 block back and forth to the hospital. Inn charged us $18x3=$54, but garage charged us another $10 cash for an hour and a half because we left at 1:30p. Total $64. If we had paid the garage directly for all of it instead of paying the Inn, the garage would have only charged us for 70 hours, which is 3 flat-day-rates@$17=total $51, instead of $64 we paid. BUT, if you are going to be driving in and out of the garage while you are there, then paying the Inn is cheaper, because the Inn will give you a voucher each time you drive in and out, so that you only pay $18 a day while staying at the Inn, instead of paying the maximum to the garage each time you drive in and out (which would be very expensive). HOT WATER: The 1st and 2nd days, the water turned ice cold in the middle of my shower. It was about 8a, so I thought maybe the hot water had been used up in morning rush hour. The 3rd day I waited until midday, thinking the hot water would be recovered by then, but it was ice cold all morning. So it was impossible to take a hot bath or even wash hands in warm water. OVERALL--it is generally expensive to stay in Boston, and you don't get much for your money, but if you need a clean, simple, reasonably priced place near the major medical center at Longwood, this Inn fits. Next door to Dana-Farber Cancer, Brigham/Womens, Childrens, Beth Israel & others, you can just keep the car parked & walk. FOOD: Inn's restaurant is open from 6a to midnight 7 days, which helps when you have to time-shift around medical emergencies. Restaurant staff was very friendly. Food attempted to be creative and interesting-- a lot of it is a little bit spicy if you are a no-pepper person, even the clam chowder has tabasco in it. But food was fresh and tasty. Staff gladly packed up meals to go and food and beverages for us to take to the room. Adjacent food court is open less hours than restaurant, but handy with McDonalds and the typical fast food. CLEANING: Inn's cleaning staff was also very friendly, but note that English is limited. AVAILABILITY: Inn fills up. When we had our medical emergency (son in an accident), online booking showed no availability. I called the Inn and they said they could get us that one night for sure. By the time we drove a few hours to get there, another night had opened up. Each day we checked with them to alert them whether we were looking for another night, so we were able to stay as many nights as we needed. On the other hand, every night we heard them turning people away, suggesting other hotels because they were full.

Generally speaking the cleaning at the room was so so the carpet looks really dirty and so the towels they put at the bathrooms, the rest of the hotel lookd really clean, the gym is on good conditions. The breakfast is quite good they try to add more options comoare to other chains sometimes they have pancakes, sausages etc. Their laundry room is not good the dryer takes like 3 hours to dry the clothes otherwise you need to put really small amount of clothes several times so it work. The staff at the hotel in genera is not polite at all even at the front desk they are quite moody.

LOTS of hall noise in the middle of the night. To add to the misleading 'airport' hotel impression the name of the property gives, the shuttle doesn't start running until 6 a.m., and that was cutting it too fine for us, so we ordered a taxi (unexpected additional $35.00 expense). A van saying 'airport transport' showed up at the appointed hour, but said it had to wait for another couple before taking us to the airport.

Our room was a King Suite; it was tastefully decorated and the high ceilings gave it a spacious feel. The sitting area looked like the one in the hotel photos and had a long desk, plenty of power recepts and a large open area that allowed easy access for our suitcases. The kitchenet had a bar type sink, microwave, frig and single cup coffee / tea maker. The FREE hot breakfast was terrific; hot waffels, eggs, bacon or sausage or ham, cereal, yogurt, fresh breads and pastries. This saved us both time and money every day. Now the location, for such a reasonable rate, I didn't expect it would be close to much of anything. Ends up, for our needs, it was close to everything. The conference hotel was less than 5 miles away and everything else was less that 2 miles; Dolphine Mall, International Mall, large grocery and drug stores, all types of American and International restaurants (Peruvian, Argentinian, Korean, Japanese, French, Cuban, Italian, Greek, Brazillian, etc, etc) , fast food and bakeries, gas stations, banks, access to high speed roads (Turnpike, etc), everything we needed.

The lobby was decent and clean, and check-in was fast and friendly. We got up to our room and the decor was nice, but the rug was extremely dirty. It turned everyone's socks brown after a short time of walking on it! The bathroom was clean, but when my husband went to shower he said the drain was backed up. We didn't bother to complain since we were only here for one night, but these things affected our impression. Free wifi was nice, and they had a business centre in the lobby where I was able to use the computer and even print my boarding passes (complimentary). The free breakfast in the morning was very busy, and we usually can't stand the selection of most hotels' free breakfasts and this was no different. Dry looking pastries and bagels. They did have a waffle bar, yogurts and cereals though (but didn't try any so can't say whether it was good or not). We only ended up grabbing a few oranges for the kids to tide them over, and instead drove to Versailles bakery on Calle Ocho for some cuban pastries. Boy was I glad that we did because these were well worth it. Highly recommend the Pastel de Guayaba (recommended on Best Thing I Ever Ate by Aaron Sanchez) and another sugary looking one with cheese inside...these were all fresh and even still warm! Check-out was slow. I was paying with a gift card I purchased on bestwestern.com, so I'm not sure if that's why, but it took wayyyy too long, and there was only one person at the desk, so a line started to form. I'm not sure if we just got a bad room, since most of the reviews on here seemed positive, but because of our experience I probably would not stay here again.

It would appear that there is only one bus an hour and if there is traffic (which there would appear to be at all times) the trip will take longer..

There was a funny smell in the hallway, which I am still trying to decide what it was but at least it was not in the room. As the kids were hungry they called the pizza delivery companies (whose leaflets were pushed under the door) for some food as nobody could be bothered to go out to find a restaurant. Next morning we were all up very early and ate the buffet breakfast which was fine. The kids did not make use of the pool which looked nice as the morning was overcast. We therefore decided not to hang around as we had originally planned and decided to go early to pick up our car.. The shuttle bus left on time and took us back to the airport.

(May 19 - 20) Booked a room with a king size bed and it was huge but the bathroom was tiny. Thought they could have given up a couple feet in the room to make the bathroom bigger. It had mini frig, sink, and microwave. The pool area was tiny but personally didn't matter for me or spouse as we were just there for the night to be close to the airport. The room was clean, staff was friendly and answer questions about how to get to the airport and some restaurants in the area. Near dolphin mall which has a ton of places to eat and shop if you want to get out of the room for a bit and get something to eat. It would have been easy to get to the airport but NW 41st Ave and La Juene rd (the area around the airport) is under major construction and when it rains it floods and we barely got the rental car through 3 ft of water. The signs for the rental return coming from the hotel were taken down due to all the construction and we passed it....the signs were up on the other side of the highway when we turned around. Aside from the hotel, it's a nightmare to return a rental car at the Miami airport right now. It was the worst experience we have ever had.

Both times, the hotel was clean, comfortable, and new-looking. Our only complaint (hardly worth making) was that the elevator was a little slow. It is not far (10 minute drive) from some good mid-class restaurants like Chili's, Doral Ale House, Applebee's, to relax and dine late after an evening flight to Miami. Back to the hotel -- our room was spacious and well-appointed. The hotel staff was very polite, and the free breakfast (I had waffles and sausage) was great.

We arrived pretty late after a really had flight and I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel staff greeted us kindly and could tell that we were beat up from our trip and made sure that we comfortable. We were traveling with 3 children (2 young, 1 teenager). The room was very clean and it was actually a good size for an overnight trip. The decor in the room seemed to be up to date. The lobby was also very nice. It was nice for a quick stay at a Best Western. The staff was helpful in assisting us with ordering food for the children and the hotel offered free use of its business center which was helpful because I had some last minute arrangements to make regarding our trip. The next morning the hotel offered us free breakfast. It was cereal, muffins, fruit, etc. but it was decent especially when traveling with small, picky children. The morning staff was also quite helpful, directing us to a local shopping center for last minute cruise items. When we were ready to leave they helped us get a cab to our cruise ship. My only complaint is that the hotel referred us to the Best Western Miami Beach for our post cruise stay. THAT WAS A NOT A GOOD SUGGESTION (see my review of that location!!). Other than that, it is a good hotel to stay in if you are passing through Miami.

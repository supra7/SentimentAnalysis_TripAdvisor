The price was right and the location suited me. It is not in the liveliest areas of San Diego if you are looking for night life, but it is just 1 mile from Old Town, where most train and buses run by, and it offers complimentary shuttle ride within 5 miles. Thus Sea World, San Diego Zoo, and Old Town,are all a free ride away. The shuttle can pick you up too if pre-arranged. And the drivers go the extra mile to give you directions and make you feel welcomed. This is a clean and hospitable 3 stars hotel on the Hotel Circle, about 6 miles from downtown. Breakfast is included in the price (basic breakfast). It has a pool, a helpful staff that will gladly offer information on tours and book them for you. The room we stayed in was spacious, and the bed was comfortable.

We ended up staying 2 nights, My husband and I took our nephew and our 2 boys to the San Diego Zoo and our kids just looved being at the hotel rather than the Zoo because they went swimming the WHOLE TIME, my kids enjoyed every minute of the pool because it wasn't very deep for them it only went up to 6ft, my nephew actually learned how to swim here!! the pool area was very clean and the water was clear, they even had towels put out for us! the only problem was there were no bathroom around the pool so I had to take my kids all the way up to the room soak and wet to use the restroom. The breakfast was ok, we had better at different hotels that also served complementary breakfast but it was free so i can't complain. The other problem I also had was the fitness center was VERY small so if you plan on coming to have a good work out during vacation don't bother bringing your gym clothes your better off doing laps in the pool! We had the kids suite with the bunk bed and king bed, there were 2 tv's with 1 remote control, the other thing I had a problem with were the see through curtains between the kids room and the king room, i wanted to walk out of the shower to get dressed because the bathrooms were already small as it is but couldn't because i had my nephew, it would have been easier to have thick curtains so i asked the house keeper for 2 extra blankets and covered the doors.

There was plenty to choose from: eggs (scrambled & hard-boiled), sausage, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, pastries, muffins, toast and a waffle bar. Juice, coffee & milk. This was prob one of the best hotel breakfasts we've ever had, especially since we didn't feel rushed to grab food & finish before 9:30. Workers were extremely nice.

This hotel had a clear offering for this configuration, at a good price, in a good location, which was our reason for choosing the hotel. We found it clean and comfortable. The hotel advises that you should plan your breakfast timing and this is good advice - the breakfast room is small and crowded if you go on the peak times. There is a heated pool that we didn't use, a good guest laundry and a small business centre, and WIFI access. The location is about a 15 minute drive from Seaworld.

The breakfast spread was slightly larger than most Comfort Inns, but somehow the quality was lower. Eggs and sausage patties were cold, and the bread products were tasteless. OJ was undrinkably syrupy. Somehow, even the make-your-own waffles were rubbery and worse than normal. So I guess you can say I left with a bad taste in my mouth. :) On a positive note, the pool area looked above average for a Comfort Inn, and the front desk staff was pleasant.

Snagged this hotel via Hotwire and was pleased with the experience. Basic motel/hotel but clean with a nice, small pool for young families, and a pretty decent free breakfast with scrambled eggs, sausage, hard boiled eggs, cereal, instant oatmeal, waffles, pastries, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee and mocha/hot chocolate. (The small breakfast area does get crowded, however.) We were traveling with our teenaged daughter so we requested two beds. When we checked in, they gave us room 343, a room at the end of the hall that had a longish corridor before opening out to two double beds, a sleeper sofa and a desk. The room could sleep 6 so there was plenty of room for the three of us. No view to speak of and it was a bit noisy from the freeway so if you're a light sleeper, probably should ask for a room facing away from the freeway. There is both covered and outdoor parking. They normally charge about $8 for parking but they waived the fee for us since there was a tiny glitch checking in. This particular room had plenty of closet/armoire/dresser space, a toilet/bath/shower room with a door and a sink area that was outside of that. An unusual set up that worked o.k. for this room because of the long corridor until you get to the bedroom area. This is not really a suite, just an unusually shaped room. The furnishings were updated but basic, except for the 32\" flatscreen TV. A fridge and coffeemaker also were included, but no microwave in this room. Since we were there only overnight, we didn't use the fitness center, pool or laundry room but the fact that this hotel had all of those amenities seem to make it a good deal for the money. One tip: there are two Comfort Inns on Hotel Circle (sort of a loop filled with many chain hotels on either side of the 8 Freeway). This one is on the far west side of Hotel Circle, north of the 8. There is another one that is more east, on the south side: I think that one is called Comfort Inn Hotel Circle, as opposed to this one which is called Comfort Inn Zoo/Sea World.

That's not such a big deal I guess but we were annoyed at the hotel staff for organising local limo drivers who had set prices for their services. Three times we requested at taxi and three times hotel staff organized limo drivers who they seemed to know very well. These drivers did not have vehicles with meters and therefore just named their price. The drivers were not cheap by any means however they were punctual. On the whole though, we were dissatisfied with this element of our stay because we felt like we paid more for drivers than we would have paid for a taxi. For example, a ride to the local shopping mall which was literally 3 1/2 minutes away cost $10 and the driver waited for a tip.

We never heard the freeway, and rarely heard anyone in the pool (and there were swimmers). We did have the ac on low or high but no noise came over it. Never heard next door neighbors, but did hear the folks above us at 4:11am moving around, throwing shoes etc. When I called the hotel to verify something prior to check-in, I asked if there was a microwave we could use in the breakfast room since we weren't reserving a room that had one (all rooms have small fridges but not all have micros) but the breakfast room I think gets locked up. The front desk attendant indicated if we brought the food to the front desk, they would warm it for us in the breakroom. Wonderfully, they did that for us twice at dinner time heating up burgers and beans. Check-in was very quick and easy. Christian did a great job. We were originally in a 4th floor room (out of 4 flrs) but preferred a room away from the freeway. Christian moved us to the 2nd floor room facing the pool. There isn't a level of guest rooms underneath where we were but the underground parking which never disturbed us. We got a double queen with a sofabed and had lots of room. The bathroom had one light and was a little dim but you get used to it. The sink is outside the toilet/tub room and is well lit. The fridge area is opposite the sink and has a storage shelf for your food above the fridge, and extra space on top by the coffee maker and ice bucket. We had a flat screen tv. The room is clean on the most used surfaces, but a couple need some attention (there is room between the walls and sides of the sink cabinet where stuff had fallen on the floor in between and was dirty; the sides of the bedside table had some spills dried on it near the floor.) The bed was comfortable; pillows a bit small but there are plenty given. There was some light mustiness in the halls and the room upon entering (the ac fixed that). There was no smoke smell in our room or on the floor (some nonsmoking hotels we've still smelled smoke in). The pool and hottub were really nice. Very clean. Towels were provided. Laundry room available (costs $4.75 I think per load for everything). Didn't use. Elevators though a little small, were both quick. Hotel provides luggage carrier racks to transport luggage to rooms from cars. Breakfast was great-lots of breads-bagels, danish, breads. There were scrambled eggs and sausage (I didn't try but my husband didn't care for them), yogurt, make your own waffles, cereals, coffees, teas, and juices. There were a few other things I think. Go earlier if you don't want a crowd. Tip-there are no trays to take food back to the room so we brought the small plastic tray under the ice bucket. While I was waiting for our dinner to heat, watched the front desk guy (I want to say Dwayne, but not sure that was his name) serving the guests. Always professional and helpful. I ran into him by the elevators while he was going up and he asked how our stay was and was very nice. The only issue we really had was our fridge would not get cool enough. We checked in around 515 and by 10 it still was at 53 degrees (gauge on top). The maintenance guy who came by said at 7 (when I called for service on it) that it should be at 41-43 degrees and should be at that by 8. Said he would come by then, but he didn't show. He thought that it wasn't cooling because we had so much stuff in there. Yes, we had filled it about 80%. We went to the pool at 915, came back at 10 and it was still above 50 degrees and not coming down, so I called back to the front desk. The maintenance guy showed up at the door toting another fridge. This one plugged in at 45 degrees and in an hour was down to 42. There is a Whole Foods within 5 minutes of the hotel, the Amtrak on Kettler was less than 10 minutes away and there was almost nobody on the road when I picked up my husband at 8pm.

Within minutes to the zoo, Balboa park, beaches. Only 45 minutes to LegoLand and San Diego zoo safari park. My kids LOVED to make their own breakfasts every morning with lots of choices. Swimming in the pool everyday was a great way to end the day. The kids suite with bunk beds were a real treat for the kids. Nice that the rooms were separated by a sliding door.

It is easily accessible from the freeway and close to just about everything in San Diego which is why it is so busy. We stayed there for four nights on two different floors in two different rooms. Rooms are not overly large and have armoires instead of closets. It is an older hotel that has been updated so parts look new and some details tell its age. We had a double queen with a fold out couch and a second room with a king and bunk beds. The bunk bed concept is great with a room divider but be aware that the top bunk has a weight limit of 100 pounds so it is not an option for a larger pre-teen or teenager. The hotel was very clean and the hotel staff was constantly on the go cleaning, fixing, delivering - I was amazed at the logistics. Parking is mainly under the hotel and quite exciting! You will pay a nominal fee to park - cheaper than most in the area- and is limited and full all the time. Breakfast was not bad but they have a sign in the lobby about wait times for breakfast - 630 -730 easy, 730-830 moderate wait, 830-930 lines - and they are not joking. It was like a three ring circus free for all up there if you go late.

In addition, the hotel has a complementary breakfast which have different food such as eggs, fruits, cereal, bread, sausages, and others. It was a decent continental breakfast. Now, do I have some recommendation for the hotel staff: 1. Parking is not gated it, therefore it should be free. 2. Breakfast area is really too small for the amount of people the hotel host.

The staff was friendly and check-in was speedy. The hotel is convenient to SeaWorld as expected but the hotel property is too small to provide adequate parking and the parking is extremely cramped/hard to enter and exit. Not only that, it costs $7.95 extra per day to park your car in a tiny little space. I expect parking to be included in my room rate. We were staying with 4 adults and 3 young children and had reserved two suites. The suites had been renovated to an extent and were tastefully decorated. Unfortunately, the suites are as cramped as the parking lot. It was difficult to get into the bathroom and close the door. The bathroom was so small that the sink was located away from the bathroom on the long wall of the bedroom. The room was quite warm until I discovered an overhead cooling unit in the bedroom that could be switched on to cool that area. The main HVAC unit was located in the small living room to the front of the suite. There was only very narrow space to walk between the wall and the beds to get to the living room area. With 3 adults, 2 children and 2 small strollers in our unit it was not easy to get around. The complimentary breakfast served on the 4th floor from 6:30 am to 9:30 am was a total ZOO. I guess that is why they call it Comfort Inn & Suites Zoo! The place was packed with people trying to get to the food and servers trying to keep the food supply stocked while people lucky enough to find food were trying to find a place at one of the few tables provided. The organization of the food buffet was very poor. People had to wander around finding food, silverware, napkins etc. that were not placed in a logical sequence. This added greatly chaos of a large number of guests trying to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast. Vending machine sodas, by the way, were $2.00 each. Other than that, I would say the beds were quite comfortable, and the room was really rather quiet so I did enjoy a good night's rest.

You would think that that would be included in the crazy rate that you already pay. Also, I was charged a $49.00 fee (I suppose for a security deposit), $25.00 for parking (again, RIDICULOUS!), and a $30.00 fee that when I asked the employee what that was for, she tells me \"I have no idea.\" How can I be charged for something that not even the employee had any clue about?

You could take this same room and put it within a Mariott or Hyatt that we've previously stayed in. When we stayed at the Ramada by the sea just several miles from here for the same price.

The only noise we heard was the grass being mowed. There was construction going on too, NO NOISE either!!!! I wonder where they stayed at. As for parking $6.95 wow u cannot beat that compare to what all the other hotels were charging. There was not enough parking spaces for the number of rooms there. The spaces are super close, I had trouble opening my door and me and the car next to me were in the lines like we should be. I had the Larger king room, and it was nice and small, nothing large about it. The only thing that I did not like about the room was there were no dressor drewers to put clothing in. I felt like I was living out of my suite case and I hate that feeling. I stay in the Marriott all the time and I have the living space to not feel like I am living in a suite case. Now the \" hot breakfast\" was totally not a hot breakfast, the only thing they have is waffle mix and a waffle maker, that did not work half the time. I end up going to Walmart to get food and to Denny's for the remaining of my 5 days there. Only used the breakfast area 2 days. Then they also have hard boiled eggs which were over cooked and rubber like and bagels, muffins and cream cheese. No fruit or yogert at all. A big tip its nice that they have free wi-fi, but if you need to print your boarding pass you have to use your credit card just to access their main computer and then they charge you for $1 for each page that gets printed out...I end up spending $5 just to print off my boarding passes.

They also have a make your own waffle station which my husband did and said was fine. My main complaint is that there is really no noise insulation in the rooms. You can hear people talking and laughing in the hallway right outside your door. This woke us up several times both late in the evening and early in the morning. There was also a lot of noise from our neighbors. We could hear it every time they went to the bathroom when they turned on the bathroom light which has a fan. We could hear them opening and closing their squeaky closet door. We had a room on the opposite side of the freeway facing the pool, so we didn't really hear much freeway noise. But we did hear some noise from the streets a few times. Nothing too bad though. Of course in the day you'll hear noise from the pool. The location was great for us.

We got a good deal on Expedia (under $100) so the price was great. They do charge $6.95/day for parking, so keep that in mind.

The room was one of the more expensive on our trip, totaling almost $150 with taxes. That's a bit steep. My family really enjoyed the pool.

There was cereal, little pastries/muffins, boiled eggs, bagels/toast, coffee/juices, some fruit and the dreadful do-it-yourself waffle station. There was a long line, and the waffle station was a bit dirty from all of the spilled batter. I think it would be better if they had an employee in charge of the waffle making. At least have someone to oversee all of these hungry guests trying to make their own waffles. Also, the tables were not cleared or cleaned. I saw 2 ladies refill the cereal machine, but no one cleaning up after the guests.

In my personal opinion the desk clerk could have a been a bit nicer or at least learn how to speak to customers in a way that would not make one feel unwelcomed or uncomfortable. I believe she wasn't warm with my husband or myself.

The hotel itself is clean and the rooms are decent and clean, the pool area is small and closes at 10pm. There is a breakfast room on the 4th floor - the continental buffet closes at 9am - my husband and I got there at about 8:15 so it wasn't bad but as soon as it's close to 9am watch out - there was a swarm of people trying to get there at the last minute which made for uncomfortable maneuvering. The thing I liked was that you had to have a hotel key to get into the elevator from the parking garage (which by the way is 4.95 a day to park) so not just anyone could come into the hotel.

We stayed here for a couple of week nights in late August for a trip with our preschooler to visit various places in San Diego. A month before, we had stayed at the Comfort Inn right across the freeway and I have to say I was more impressed with this Comfort Inn \"Sea World/Zoo\". The renovation was obvious on the second floor where we stayed, it didn't have that smoked-in, non-smoking room odor that the Comfort Inn rooms had across the street. This is after all supposed to be a non-smoking property. The room was quite spacious. Ours was laid out like a big square rather than a long rectangle. The decor was fresh, clean and modern. The room was very clean and the air conditioning was great, no problems as other have stated. I was kind of worried about these things before I booked based on reviews, but took a chance and I'm so glad I did. I just really appreciated the simple design, and clean room - especially the clean carpet. That's a big deal to me since we stayed somewhere else on the weekend and I found out how spoiled we were when our socks turned black at the other place! We asked for a quiet room and we were given one. We clogged the toilet right when we got in (not the hotel's fault) which they quickly fixed. Bathroom light was too dim though. And the tv was fuzzy, though we fixed that by propping some of the cables up in back of the television. Pool was a modest size and warm and my child had a great time there. Parking was fine until later in the evening when it became clear how terrible the situation was. Simply no parking left except the dark side street. I circled the lot a dozen times for something to turn up and luckily it did for my van. You might have better luck with a compact car, but even then, everyone parks badly simply because the spaces are too tight and there's hardly enough room in the lanes. I'd say this is the major drawback to this hotel. Also, there shouldn't be a problem finding the location if you map it. Though it's not in plain sight, it's right off the freeway, conveniently next to the AAA and the Hunter Steakhouse next door to it has top-rate, delectable Prime Rib if you can afford it. This hotel, like the others of hotel circle, are in a great location. Pop right on the freeway and get to anywhere quickly - Sea World/Mission Bay, Old Town, Downtown, Hillcrest, Balboa Park, etc. The free breakfast was one of the great things about Comfort Inn. I showed up at 6 am to get some stuff to bring back to my room for my family before the crowd hit. Waffle mix wasn't ready, nor were some other items out until later, but it wasn't a big deal, just came back later to get them, though it was a crazy in there around 9.

The hotel is undergoing renovations. I was not warned of this when I booked, and I did use there 1 - 800 number. Due to the renovations, parking is a nightmare. There were multiple trash dumpsters and trash bags in the parking lot which took up a good chunk of parking spaces. Due to the resurfacing of the pool, they did not want you to park in front of the pool to allow for the work trucks to have access. This made parking non existent. The first night I stayed out late, and it literally took about 30minutes to find a place to park. There was a distinctly unpleasant smell to the room. It was made tolerable by keeping the fan on at all times. The odor especially bothered my daughter who is sensitive to smells. My remote control for the tv didn't work. I called to the front desk to ask for a replacement one, and no one ever came with one. After an hour, I went down to the front desk to change it out myself. I was told \"Oh yeah.\" The next night, after room service cleaned my room, I was given no hand towels or wash cloths. It took over 45 minutes for a rude security guard to come bring a handful of washcloths. The next night, we were not given any hand towels. After my prior experiences, I did not try to get them. There is a breakfast buffet. While I'm sure most of the food was alright, I could not get past the noticable moldy oranges that were put out for guest consumption. I found the employees to be generally rude and unfriendly. A smile or a thank you for coming would have done wonders for me. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is less than 10 minutes away from the airport, zoo, and Sea World.

We were put in a van \"Cloud 9\" with 5 other passangers and charged something like $12 per person. We didn't get the name of the person that told him this therefore nothing could be done regarding the charge for the \"Free Transfer service\". We got to our room, which was a handicap room that was not necessary. My husband turned on the TV and nothing but snow. The room smelled musty so I proceeded to slide the window when a portion of the frame came off in my hand. I went to use the restroom, flushed the toilet and water poured out of the ceiling over the sink that was located in the bedroom. There was a light fixture in the ceiling in that area and I was afraid of an electrical fire. We called the front desk and was told by the clerk that she would have an \"engineer\" come check out the problems. The \"engineer walked in, saw the water coming from the ceiling and said \"You need to get another room\". We loaded up our luggage and went to the front desk. We were told the place was full but she could check with the hotel across the street. To make a long story short, we couldn't find another hotel and after 2 hrs. of trying, the clerk gave us another room she was holding for a late arrival guest. This room wasn't a lot better but at least water wasn't pouring from the ceiling. Signs were posted throughout the building that the building contained chemicals that were hazardous to your health. Not a good experience! Besides the problems with the hotel, getting around from this area was very expensive. For a taxi ride to the Airport or the Pier area was $25 one way.

Rooms: We had a \"Kids Room\" that had one king-sized bed and a bunk-bed that was big enough for a six-foot-tall 16 year-old boy. The shower was newly tiled and had adequate water pressure but the water temperature fluctuated quite a bit while showering. The A/C unit seemed a little old and I had to get up several times to get it to work but it worked well when it was on. A mini-fridge and other standard room amenities (iron, coffer maker, etc.) also came with the room. Amenities: There's a great little breakfast area where guests can choose from coffee, tea, juice, toast, muffins, pastries, hard-boiled eggs, cold cereal, oatmeal, apples, and do-it-yourself Belgium waffles\u00e2\u20ac\u201call for free! The hotel provides free USA Today newspapers in the lobby and a machine outside to purchase copies of the San Diego Union Tribune. A large, heated swimming pool and spa are both open very late. There's plenty of parking: We never had a hard time finding a space, even on sold-out nights. On the lobby floor, there's a small arcade room where kids can play games. Customer Service: The front desk staff all seemed to be very helpful and friendly. The one occasion where I interacted with a housekeeper was pleasant. The attendant in the complimentary breakfast area was a busy girl (Be sure to put a dollar in her jar!). Location: The hotel is a little tricky to get to from Hwy 8. Just remember: The hotel is NORTH of Hwy 8 (hence \"Hotel Circle North\"). There are two shopping malls within a five-minute drive (Fashion Valley and Mission Valley). The Gaslamp District, Horton Plaza, The SD Zoo, Balboa Park, and Sea World are all within 10-15 minutes. The Wild Animal Park is about 25 minutes away. Hint: If you are planning to visit the Zoo and Wild Animal Park, it will be cheaper to purchase an annual membership to the Zoological Society of San Diego (Google it for more info). Overall: I wouldn't recommend this property to a newlywed couple looking for a quiet, romantic stay, but if you're traveling with kids, then it'll work nicely and save you some money at breakfast time.

The staff was friendly upon check in but we were a little aggravated after waiting in line nearly 10 min as there was only one person at the front desk. We stayed in a kids suite with the bunk beds which was fun however, for some reason, you have to put the sheets on the bed yourself which we found in a drawer below. Although others have complained about the breakfast, we found the breakfast bar fully stocked with food and easily found a place to sit. They had a full time staff member at the breakfast area ensuring that the food was not running out and the tables were wiped off. I had been warned by other reviewers about the food brochures that get put under the door and upon check in, we found two or three under our door. I guess this is becoming an issue at the hotel as our hotel room had a specific sign informing us not to order food from the companies who illegally slip in the brochers. The only complaint I would have about the hotel was the carpet that was stretched out had many waves and humps which I found myself tripping over at times. I thought this was maybe just my room but found the carpet to be the same in other rooms as we walked down the hall an could see the maids cleaning the rooms. The last item would be that you have to use your room key to access the elevator in the parking garage. This was a nice security feature except that we found that our key only worked about the half the time on the elevator.

I must agree with another reviewer - some of the folks writing these reviews must have stayed at a different hotel. This was dirty, extremely cramped. We had reserved a kids suite, but our \"suite\" was a regular room with 2 bunk beds crammed in, and no separation, as was advertised. Very poor. Breakfast room was filthy and was nearly out of most foods (not that there was a great selection to begin wth). One family spilled milk and juice on their table, their child vomitted and they simply got up and left without notifying an attendant of the \"mess\". Parking and elevators were no picnic either. Staff was non-existent and two-thirds of the laundry facilities were out of order. Also - BE WARNED - do not order food from the people who leave flyers under the door. These are not licensed providers, just people cooking out of their homes. They are not supposed to solicit at the hotel. The food will arrive late, and they will demand more than the quoted price.

If I were to return to the area, I would not stay here. At $175 per night, it is no bargin and the hotel really is bare-bones.

It reminded me of those shows where they analyse the bacteria and other organisms in the beds of hotels. I called a few hotels to see if I could get a room somewhere else but the vacancy rate that week was very low and I didn't want to spend 300.00 per night for a hotel.

The worst problem was the location. Although not that far from major attractions (as cited in their own publicity) unless you have a car, it is highly inconvenient to get to them. It takes two buses and a train to get to downtown, through a very circuitous route given the need to get around the freeways, and because Hotel Circuit is split into two sections on either side of the freeway. Of course it is almost impossible to cross the freeway as there is liimited pedestrian access. Our room, along with many looked directly onto the freeway. The staff were friendly but uninformed and were not able to give us accurate directions to get anywhere, we bascially fended for oursleves, and got better directions from someone at the bus stop who only spoke Spanish. The hotel itself is tired, old and in need of major renovation or perhaps detonation. Our room was opposite the lift, so very noisy, and their were a number of vending machines including an ice machine which guests appeared to utilise all night. I never thought ice could be so noisy.... One of the lifts and one of the three washing machines were broken for the whole of our stay. While it appeared to be a budget hotel appealing to families, the price was not budget. We paid $170 AUD per night for the privilege of staying here.

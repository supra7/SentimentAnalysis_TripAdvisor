We got our $50 worth but if you are looking for a good place to stay, this is not the place. The beds were uncomfortable and definately not meant for people who are not a couple. We got the room with two beds. There was mold in the bathroom (where the tub and toilet were, as the sink and vanity weren't in there) and there wasn't a fan in there. My daughter and her friend went to get food and the said the food was cold and terrible. If you just want a cheap place to rest your head, this place will suffice but that's about it. Don't expect much more. The redeeming quality was that the lady working the front counter at check-in and check out was very pleasant.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Buffalo, Mi", "Title": "\u201cNasty\u201d", "Author": "dutch49117", "ReviewID": "UR117376600", "Content": "I can't believe how dirty the room was.

As soon as we pulled up I could tell that the up keep was poor, the guy at the front desk was not very friendly and took for ever to check me in. As me and my wife went to find our room their was water dripping out in the halls and the carpet was wet. When we got to our room and walked in everything felt wet and everything was old and out dated. Half of the lights did not work in the room. It is now 1:00 am and can't sleep as the Bed and pillows are shit!!! The air condition is making a sqeaking noise. I'm getting my wife up out of the nasty ass wet bed and I'm driving back home. I would rather sleep in my car then to stay another minute in this dump.

Nothing about the hotel is spacious, but it is adequate. The location is excellent--close to a mall, many restaurants and stores.

I had lost my wallet and its contents, in Kansas, and was counting every penny. I was also traveling with my cat. I had a couple of days worth of business to do in Indy, and this hotel had the best rate. I found it by using my GPS. It was very convenient off of the Interstate. When I first arrived I was sceptical, since there were only a few cars, and I I could see that renovations were underway. I was pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful. The General Manager was also very helpful. I had a drive up room and it had been recently renovated with a very comfortable king size bed. The free WiFi was a blessing, because I had to contact all of my credit card companies and also order a new drivers license, due to my lost wallet. This hotel used to be a Red Roof Inn, and there were workmen fixing the stucco and making other repairs during my stay there. The coffee station was very nice, and the breakfast (included) even had a waffle station. My cat was glad to get out of the car for a couple of days too! I would certainly stay here again, and I am thankful I found this hotel!", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting.

However it was still impossible to find. It's not visible from the road and doesn't have a big sign out front - I drove right by it, twice. The staff at the front desk was short on words and a little cool. All the rooms have an outside entrance. Combined with the shady location this felt a bit unsafe. The room itself was dimly lit and smelled bad. Everything I had in the room still smells - bags, coat, shoes, etc. The carpet was not clean, I know this from wearing white socks in the room. The bed covers were outdated and ugly. The bathtub was old and soiled, glad I brought flip-flops. I considered not staying there but had reserved it through priceline, so I wouldn't have gotten my money back. This hotel is not a good deal.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, CA", "Title": "\u201cHave some problems!\u201d", "Author": "Mapletherabbit", "ReviewID": "UR3676715", "Content": "I decided to stay at this hotel after checking a lot of same kind of hotel/motels in the neighborhood. Althought Red Roof Inn is not the cheapest but offering a good deal at that time, I just decided to go there. First of all, a staff at the front desk was nice. He was extremely friendly and offered me a \"recently-renovated\" room. He was slow to do all the checking-in process, but it didn't bother me a lot. When I went into the room, I felt really chilly. The room seemed to have been air-conditioned for a while and everything there was ice-like cold, at the same time, somewhat wet. And what is worse, so were the bedcover, blanket, and sheet. When I tried to take a nap, I almost felt that I was sleeping on a water-soaked bed. The worst thing came at night. When I returned to my room, I noticed that some bugs were crawling up on the wall. They were not roaches, but creepy enough at night. However hard I tried to get rid of them(since I was too tired to go to the front desk to switch rooms), they silently reappeared and did the same thing. All right, do what you want. Next morning, I found a few dead bugs in the bath room, which gave me goosebumps. When checking out, the friendly guy was at the front desk again but spent too much time on one customer and ended up making other 3 customers waiting forever just to check out. I didn't have time to report anything that happened in my room, so I hope this helps improve their maintenance/cleaning way. Since I stayed in a room on the first floor, I cannot say the same thing would happen in any room on the second floor and above. Maybe I should try a room on the upper floor....though now I feel reluctant to do that.", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d91338-Reviews-Quality_Inn-Indianapolis_Indiana.html", "Price": "$62 - $62*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8325 Bash Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Indianapolis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">46250</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91338", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ed/50/ed509114f53ebb6e86f7f03a423fdef43large.jpg"}}

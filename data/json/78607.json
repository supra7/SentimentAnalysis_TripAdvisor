The breakfast isn't much to speak of, but they do provide coffee and fresh fruit (among more sugary breakfast items that I try to stay away from) which I appreciated. The room isn't fancy, but it's neat and clean. The bathroom was sparkling. They do provide soap, shampoo and lotion which were of decent quality. The toilet is way to close to the vanity, someone didn't measure well when they renovated! But, it works. There is a tv in the room with limited channels, but hey, you're in wine country!

Yes, it's cheap but it's also kind of sad in a way. It's a property with so much potential if they put some effort and some $$ into it. It looks like Stalag 13 as you're driving by on the highway. We arrived to front desk staff person that really didn't seem to want to be at work that day. She gave us a room on the left side of the property, even though we were one of few people staying there. We arrived to an overpowering smell of bleach in the room upon arrival. The door was open, perhaps to air it out and you could smell the bleach before you even got in the room. I can see why they used so much bleach. There was mold in the shower. It took forever to get hot water in the bathroom sink. The windows in the bathroom were filthy and the screen even worse. (See photo) Despite the dirt/mold in the bathroom, the rest of the room was clean, so I rated it average. One thing I've learned from my travels and especially my line of work is that photos often make a property look much better than it appears in \"real life\". Some of the photos you see here on Trip Advisor give the impression that it's a very nice place, where the reality is that i wasn't sure whether our room had been refurbished or not. I don't think so. Pros: microwave and fridge in the room, less expensive than other places in the area, basic continental breakfast in the am, pool (we didn't use as it was too cool - December visit) Cons: tired facility, like walking back into the 1950/60's with shower stalls and bathrooms that are really run down and showing their age, dirty screens, apathetic staff (on our visit), hair dryer not working Would I stay here again?

The check-in lady was a bit rough around the edges. She wasn't happy we had booked our winery tours in advance and stressed that she could've gotten us better deals, then showed us her brochure that would've saved us a grand total of five dollars and not included many amenities we received. We didn't really like being hassled to switch plans on check-in. Breakfast was terrible, and no one ever cleaned the breakfast room, resulting in spilled cereal, milk, and bread crumbs all over every table. It was pretty gross, but we grabbed bananas and explored the beautiful outdoors. Some say the location isn't walking distance to downtown, but we're New Yorkers, so we disagree. A 20-30 minute leisurely stroll with not a single hill just isn't too bad. If you drove, it'd take all of two minutes.

I'm used to staying in nice hotels, but my friend and I agreed that we would try to \"budget\" when it comes to lodging during our recent road trip. Food, on the other hand, had no such monetary constraints, but I digress. We stayed here on the 19th of this month, and I can honestly say I LIKED my first motel experience! Our room was huge, and the shower/bathroom was clean and tiles/drains did not conjure up memories of the communal showers back in college. There was free Wi-Fi, a working microwave, and a fridge. The bed was slightly uncomfortable and the sheets were scratchy, but that was totally understandable since you're clearly not going to find 400+ count sheets in a motel. The free continental breakfast was on par with the breakfast I have every day at work from the hospital cafeteria, so that was appreciated. Only complaint I have is the lady at the front desk who seemed to have a bit of an attitude, but at least I only had to deal with her while checking in and out. I'm definitely staying at the Wine Valley Lodge during my next vacation in Napa!", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay at Wine Valley Lodge and Great Waffles!\u201d", "Author": "travel4day", "ReviewID": "UR19994676", "Content": "After much searching for economical rooms in the Napa Valley, I decided to reserve three rooms for a group of us at the Wine Valley Lodge.

The rates are very reasonable for the area, although if your main objective for visiting Napa Valley is wine tasting, you'll find Wine Valley Lodge a bit far from where most wineries are located (15-30 min. drive). The room is comfortable and clean. The bathroom is clean, but lacks a bathtub (shower only). The water pressure is low, and the water temperature fluctuates quite a bit. It is evident this motel was built in the 50's, and hasn't been renovated for a while. The building, furniture, and decor of the rooms are all very dated. You won't find internet hookup here, and if you need a hair dryer or iron, be prepared to make a trip to the front desk, as they're not available in the guest rooms. All in all, we would stay here again, but only if we couldn't find another property at a reasonable price.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "louisiana", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not more\u201d", "Author": "tchefuncta", "ReviewID": "UR3533326", "Content": "The room was fine.

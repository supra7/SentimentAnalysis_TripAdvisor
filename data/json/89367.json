My room was nice, but (is this shocking?) there was hair caught up in the towel. The bathroom was clean and bright and the shower products were great as well. There were NO bugs, drugs, or trash in the room. After I had dinner at a separate restaurant I came back and around 11PM, a lady was walking up and down, up and down, up and down the hallway SCREECHING on her phone. I called the front desk and the clerk came up to my floor and told the lady to leave and she did. This is why the sleep quality is marked as \"poor\". The next morning, I went down to the Daybreak breakfast at 7AM and it wasn't fully up-and-running yet, but I got some food and sat down. A few minutes later, I got up to use the waffle iron and the Indian lady running the breakfast comes up and shouts, \"NO HOT! NO HOT!\". I realized it hadn't warmed up and waited a few minutes and she told me it was ready. The waffles were good, long story short. The food selection was lackluster, to be honest.

I called to ask for another set and received an additional washcloth and hand towel, but no bath towel. The hotel itself was decorated in early American garage sale. Nothing matches. The towels are worn to nubs. There are no fewer than five patterns in the bathroom itself and even more in the main room. The airconditioning had two options: frigid and off. I like it cold, but even I couldn't handle having cold air blowing on me constantly. The shower never got hot. The TV? All purple - what channels that actually worked were tinted purple, anyhow. There was no way to adjust the color. The promised WiFi was apparently there, but did not hold a connection at all on either of our laptops. We'd connect and be booted about 5 minutes later.

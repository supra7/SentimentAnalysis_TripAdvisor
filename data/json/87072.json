The room was clean, neat and the bed was so comfortable we did not want to get out of it. Betty, one of the staff there was so personable and informative of the Miami area for us to visit. She gave us information on Bayside shopping district to visit before our cruise. Then after our cruise. The staff took us to the airport to catch a city bus to visit downtown Miami at South Beach area for shopping and the bus returned us to the airport for the hotel to pick us back up. This kept us away from the high charge of taxi fare. I would recommend if you are timid of the culture of city tranist and cannot stand the overcrowding it would not be for you. This was so efficient and as a penny pincher as we are it fit our needs. It gave us an overlook view of South Beach area and the culture and shopping area, even though we are not much shoppers.

Flo, on the front desk, was very helpful in sorting out some quarters for me to use the laundry, and even replaced the ones I put in the wrong slot, free of charge! So then, I decided to ask about having a refund for the taxi. Initially, Flo told me that it wasn't possible because we were travelling after 11.30pm and their shuttle only runs until that time. I was pretty sure that, on the main travel sites that I use to research hotels, there was no mention of this, and I was then shown through to speak to the manager. She was extremely empathetic, and immediately did a search on the website I had used...and indeed, the first line of the description of the hotel was \"Free airport shuttle\"! with no mention of limited hours.

ROOM LOCATION: Do not, I repeat, do not agree to a room on the ground floor if you like it quiet. We were in a rush at the desk and agreed to it but didn't bother changing rooms because it would have been too much of a hassle as one family member had already fallen asleep and our luggage was opened.

There was also some kind of permanent light shining into our window while we slept and the worst part was that the drapes could not be drawn closed to block the light. Fortunately, we were dead tired enough to sleep through the whole night. I don't know how many floors are in this hotel but if you stay here insist on a higher floor away from the noisy area.

Now for the cons: the parking lot leads through the pool area, so you get the occasional gawker, the front desk staff said that they had room service, all you had to do was dial 0. We tried to get room service repeateadly to no avail. There was never any answer and then the line got cut off. We talked to the front desk about this and they said that \"room service\" is actually a restaurant offsite and to keep trying because they might be busy. We tried again and again and the same thing happened, until we just gave up. So this hotel says they have room service when in fact, they dont. Another thing, the maids aren't professional enough. On one occasion we returned to our room to get something we forgot and we saw the maid watching a soap opera in spanish while cleaning our room! This was unacceptable. On another ocassion another maid was talking loudly on her cellphone while cleaning the bathroom. And we encountered them numerous times in the elevator and all they do is just stare at you without greeting you, so we have to say hi in order to kill the ackwardness. All in all our experience at this hotel was very disappointing, we wished we had stayed at a better place.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHidden Bargain, Great Spot\u201d", "Author": "scbleo", "ReviewID": "UR33464564", "Content": "Located off 826 and right by the Miami Airport, this newer hotel is small, clean, and a great deal.

The location is ideal when traveling for short stays with family or overnights. Only complaint is of our two queen beds, mine had a major dip in the middle that made for an uncomfortable sleep. My son's bed was firm, and my mom and brother who slept in another 2Q bdroom, had firm beds. So I guess, we were the only ones with the dip bed.

There are no frills or microwaves, and the rooms are standard hotel size, windows are not really sound proof - we heard a motorcycle outside going by. No plane noises.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use this feature, but it may be economical for some. There is a fountain out front and the lobby is very nice. The gym and dining area had a new feeling about them. The carpeting looked new on our hallway and in the room. There was a slight smell in the room, may have been the new carpet. The bedding was comfortable and fresh. The bathroom was clean and it seemed as if there were some new renovations including the vanity area. The gardens around the pool are very nice and we had the pool to ourselves. The breakfast is a nice plus with sausage, potatoes, and eggs, which were new to me. It was like a flat poached egg. I had never seen this before, but most people seemed to like them. There were various breads, pastries and fruits to choose from and the beverage choices, juices, teas, milk and coffee seemed vast. The coffee machine produced some wonderful and varied brews, highly recommended. One of the reasons for choosing this hotel were the decent reviews for a 2-star hotel especially for cleanliness, which is a must for me, and a refrigerator in the room. One of us requires refrigerated medicine. When I asked the front desk to put the very small portable fabric cooler in the kitchen freezer so that the ice packs would be ready in the morning, they accommodated us with a smile and I had no problem retrieving it the next day.

My room was large, bright and very clean. The view was of a somewhat busy stretch of road, but did also have some beautiful trees - which was the only thing I could see while lying in bed. The one negative thing I have to say about the hotel is about the 'fitness equipment'. It actually consists of a treadmill, an elliptical machine and a reclining stationary bike in a tiny room. Not really much of a fitness area but it was well air-conditioned with water and towels available. The complimentary breakfast the next morning was delicious and generous - everything from toast to pancakes to eggs.

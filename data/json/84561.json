On our daughter's recommendation, we stayed at the Orlando and couldn't have been more pleased. We were initially concerned that the hotel might be too hip for us older travelers, but we felt perfectly at ease here and noticed we weren't the only 50+ year old travelers staying (though this fact shouldn't scare away the younger crowd who clearly outnumbered us). Here's what we really liked: First, the service from the front desk to the valet was outstanding and always pleasant and friendly (special kudos to Paul). (We do think the cost of parking per day - $29 - is pretty steep even for LA.) Customer service is one of our main criterion in rating a property and The Orlando did not disappoint! Second, the room was quiet, roomy, and comfortable. As requested, we were given an upper floor room away from the elevator. Having a peaceful room to escape to is another of our criteria and again, The Orlando came through! Despite having a connecting room, we never heard our next door neighbors. We appreciated that the linens are high quality, the flat screen TV is huge, there's an in room coffee maker, nice robes/slippers are provided, and the newspaper is delivered to your door. The bathroom, which is newly remodeled, is modern and sleek and has a great shower. My husband wished the mattress was a little firmer and the down comforter not so warm, but I found the bedding just fine. Third, as others have reported, the location is excellent. If you want to be in a touristy location, then the Orlando is not for you. However, if you want to feel like you live in this part of LA, then stay here. Third Street is a happening place, but not in a crazy way. Cute, interesting shops and trendy restaurants frequented by locals. While the in hotel restaurant, The Churchill, is very popular right now, the noise from there seems to be pretty confined. We enjoyed two breakfasts at Joan's on 3rd, as well as desserts from Magnolia Bakery which is across the street. In summary, The Orlando will be our new go-to property when staying in the Beverly Hills/West Hollywood area.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jene74", "ReviewID": "UR126874014", "Content": "This is a great little Boutique hotel with great service and some added touches that you just don't get at other hotels.

The wife wanted a So-Cal vacation and as I lived there at one time, I decided we would spend the LA portion of our trip in my old neighborhood, rather than get taken by the more touristy locations. Good choice. The Orlando is right on Third Street, which connects you to LA - West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, in an instant. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful, the rooms were very clean and comfortable and the rate, which I shopped for was reasonable, once you give into paying full price. ( I did shop, found a slightly lower rate through a booking site and took advantage of their \"Best Rate Guarantee\" which delivered the lower rate and an upgrade, although I have my doubts about what room we ultimately wound up in. They told us it was a Deluxe King, but we passed another room being cleaned and it had a much bigger bathroom, which I was told is the difference between the Standard and Deluxe.) Either way, the room, while being perhaps slightly dated, was great. The King Size bed was great. The turn-down service left little chocolates for us and we were in the back, facing the pool which did not cause any problems. VALET PARKING is not cheap at $29 a day, however in that area, the rules on the streets are dependent on neighborhood parking permits. There are meters you can probably use on Third Street, if you time it right after 6pm at night and before 8am in the mornings.

The first room I was sent to did not even have a room number on the door. I cautiously inserted my key and discovered that it was indeed the correct room. However, within 10 minutes, I had to call the front desk and request a room change because the sound of the air conditioner units on the roof were literally SHAKING the windows. They moved me to a room down the hall which was unfortunately a connecting room. I did not want to be THAT person so I just dealt with all of the noise coming from the connecting room. I settled in to do work and watch a movie. But the entire movie system was down. So much for that idea. I tried to order Room Service and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes. I had to call the front desk and have them place the order. The food was very good but there was no tray left so I had to place the plates outside my door. Not exactly sanitary. Then I wanted to order some cookies for a late night snack. I called down to room service (which is the hotel restaurant) and was greeted by perhaps the rudest room service person ever. She told me it was loud and I had to speak up. And when she still couldn't hear me she copped such a b*%chy attitude and proceeded to either disconnect me or put me on hold. At that point, I hung up and called the front desk. They were very helpful and placed the order for me. The room is okay for the price. Do not get an adjoining room. Much too noisy. And the Room Service is horrible. They charged me an 18 percent service charge but never told me - nor was it indicated on the receipt. So I ended up double tipping. And not having the movie service definitely was a negative. The front desk staff was very helpful. But they could not erase the awful customer service provided by the Room Service staff. I often stay at the Palomar on the Westside which is another boutique hotel. Similarly priced but SO much better in terms of service and amenities.

The front desk service is friendly and helpful. They always greet you when you arrive or leave and take the time to answer any question that was asked. Since we had booked on one of the \"name to be revealed after you pay\" sites, we weren't expecting The Orlando to accommodate our request of two beds instead of a king bed. They didn't have a double room when we checked in, but gave us a spacious room with a king and a pull out sofabed. They also honored my request of getting a room on one of the higher floors and away from the elevators. The fact that I booked on a discount site was never mentioned. Very discreet and professional! Since the hotel had just finished a major renovation and update, the room was clean and very nicely appointed with modern amenities. The bed was super comfortable, and they offer a turn down service at night complete with chocolates on your pillows. The bathroom was on the smaller side, but again, very nicely appointed. There is no bathtub in the hotel's bathrooms, but it wasn't an issue for us as we prefer to shower anyways. For the three nights that we were there, we slept comfortably, and had a very pleasant, quiet stay. The only minor negative is that the hotel has only one public computer and printer in the lounge, so sometimes, it is quite inconvenient waiting for someone to finish on the computer so that you can use the printer. The hotel itself is situated right on trendy 3rd Street with many restaurants and boutiques. They have their in house restaurant that just opened which we never got around to eating at, but every time that we passed by, it was packed. I highly recommend Joan's On Third (http://joansonthird.com/), which is right down the street from The Orlando, for at least one brunch or lunch. Their sandwiches and desserts are fabulous. For cheap and filling eats, there is a Soup Plantation ten minutes away in the direction of the Beverly Center. In the same complex as the Soup Plantation, there is also a CVS drugstore for any last minute purchases. The Grove and the Farmer's Market is a 15 minute walk away.

The furnishings are very modern and included an armoire, open shelving that ran the half the length of the room, a small couch, and a nice sized desk. I also appreciated high-tech touches in the room including free Wi-Fi. Additionally, there was a great bedside clock with an iPad charger, a separate Bose iPod docking station and a very large flat screen TV. Also worth noting, in the lobby, guests have free use of a Mac with a printer that I used to grab my boarding passes before heading home. You will find a small, under utilized, salt-water pool on the 2nd floor. It is only 4 feet deep. A small bench ran the length of the pool (approx. 1 foot deep). This could be good for younger children who might not be able to stand, as there was not a traditional shallow end. There are several lounge chairs and two very nice seating areas.

It's a quick walk to the Grove/Famer's Market and CBS Studios, the Beverly Center and Hollywood was a quick and cheap cab ride. Check in was very quick and the front desk staff were always very polite and helpful. The room was wonderful. Very clean and modern. The beds were very comfortable with lots of pillows and clean/fresh linens. The carpet was in good condition...no worries about walking around barefoot on a nasty carpet...this was very clean. Nice flat screen tv with lots of table top space (desk, bedside table and mantel) to put things. Air conditioning is controlled by a thermostat on the wall and the temperature was always very comfortable. Didn't hear any noise from the street, in the hallways or from adjoining rooms. The bathroom was great. Very clean and well stocked. HUGE shower and loads of counter space. Lots of little cubbies to store things too! Free wifi and a free computer in the lobby...with a printer to print boarding passes! LOVE that! It's a great hotel, very reasonably priced.

Not to mention being so close to Melrose, Santa Monica Blvd, there is so much choice within 10 minutes of the hotel. Before we checked in, a colleague mentioned that the hotel was under construction. Upon checking in there wasn't much construction going on but you could see that renovations were definately being done or in the process of by looking at the walls, carpet, elevator, etc. My first room was on the top floor, the 5th floor. Room was spacious but the bathroom was less than desirable. About the size of a shoe box, with no counter space and a door that was more suited to being a janitor's door. My colleague's room was quite the opposite. Bathroom was super big with sliding doors. So I asked to be moved to another room that had a better bathroom as I could not stand opening and the closing (or should I say, slamming, as that is what the door did) every time i wanted to go to the bathroom. My second room was better although it was still not as big as my colleagues. When the renovations were done on the bathroom, the mess was not cleaned up 100%. Glue on the walls, dry wall dust, etc. was evident and sightly. If a few extra minutes were taken to clean it up when they did the renovations on the room, it would have looked better. However, the finishings were very nice. Great shower, sink, etc. And the king size bed was super comfortable.

Maybe replacing the chef would have been more cost effective? But from start to finish, no acknowledgement that this information should be provided for potential customers to make an informed view on whether or not to book at the hotel, nor that omitting this information was likely to cause a feeling of resentment for those who had booked. The room was good, no doubts, the staff apart from fatuous comments about no information about the building work, were fine. However if i had known that there was ( and still is) NO bar and NO restaurant, as well as building work on going, I would certainly have booked elsewhere. The offer of a bottle of wine from the duty manager was refused, as the point seemed to have been lost as to why I was having a moan. So when a bottle appeared in our room from another manager, it was returned to reception. I still believe that ALL the staff at the Hotel believe that there was no fault in keeping information that there was no bar, no restaurant and building work on going throughought the Hotel from potential customers. And being constantly told that the Web Site had been updated is manifestly rubbish.

We were there for 5 nights in total. First impressions were good. The location of the hotel is great; it's situated near La Cienega Boulevard, which seems to be a busy thorougfare intersecting with Santa Monica Bvd, Sunset Bvd, and other busy tourist areas. If you're a tourist, it's really no more than 15 mins or so (traffic depending of course) to some of the famous LA sights such as Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Beverly Hills, Universal, Hollywood Bowl, etc. Directly up the street from the hotel and no more than a 5 minute walk away, is the Beverly Center - which is an upscale shopping center. The brand names (Prada, Gucci, etc) were a little rich for us but nonetheless it's a good way to pass a few hours, and the food court was quite nice. Alternatively you can head down the street for about 10 mins, and you'll come across both the infamous Farmer's Market and the Grove Center. Both are busy places, but a great way to spend a Saturday morning just having an outdoor breakfast and browsing. But anyway - back to the hotel. We got checked in with no problems, and the check-in staff were very helpful and courteous. I should add that this was the case for the duration of our stay; I found the staff more than happy to assist with advice, local information, and also to deal with any issues we had. They also have a 'manager's meeting' from 5-6 every weekday if my memory serves me correctly, and during this period there is complimentary wine & cheese whilst you can chat to staff and relax in the foyer seating area. All very relaxed and hospitable. Now to the negatives. Our room was of an adequate size, but it was obvious that it was long due some refurbishing. There were quite a few carpet stains, and the bathroom (although clean) had obviously seen better days. The room in general looked 'tired'. Asides from the stains though, it was clean and had all the usual amenities that you would expect. There was also a fair bit of noise and the presence of numerous builders outside our room due to ongoing building work. It appeared that some of the rooms were indeed undergoing the refurbishment which I just mentioned - now whilst it was encouraging to see the hotel giving them something of a makeover, it would have been nice if we had actually been told there would be extensive work and noise occurring on our floor whilst we were there. This was never mentioned to us in either our booking through Hotels.com, or by the staff whilst we were there. Nevertheless, we chose not to make an issue of it as we were out for the majority of the time and the workers were usually gone when we got back. Just make sure to ask if about it if you're hoping to have a few late mornings in bed! The pool was something we were hoping to use when there. We were slightly dismayed to find that it's actually tiny - the pictures on the hotel website make it look much larger. I doubt you could actually do much swimming in it, but it would be fine for cooling down in hot weather I suppose. There was no eating area or bar in the hotel, so if you want breakfast/lunch/dinner you'll have to go out. There are however, a number of decent establishments along the same street. I recommend Doughboys which is a 5 min walk away - great breakfasts and lunches, and very reasonably priced. My last gripe with the hotel was the valet parking, which is $35 per day. This seemed extortionate. We instead left the car at the large car park directly opposite the Beverly Center, which charges only $9 for staying overnight. It is closed at night and has security barriers, so we had no worries about leaving the car there overnight. Again, it's a 5 minute walk to the hotel but the saving makes it worthwhile. All in all, I liked the Orlando Hotel but at this stage, I would only rate our experience as average. However, if the problems I mentioned were addressed (room refurbishment, presence of a breakfast bar/room, lower parking rates), the Orlando could raise it's game substantially - it already has a great location and great staff, that little bit extra would do wonders for it.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "emmadyl", "ReviewID": "UR113328042", "Content": "Our room was clean and very nice.

The floor was covered in water. 2. Last minute details had been left undone (a cord stuffed up into the ceiling in the bathroom, the door needed repainting where the old locks had been pulled off, some of the furniture/mini bar were scuffed) I'm not sure if they placed us in an \"almost finished\" room and planned to come back to those details...but it really didn't affect our stay too much. 3. We appeared to be the only ones staying on our floor. For a hotel that was \"booked\" there was an eerie sense of isolation around us. We LOVED! 1. The room had lots of space! Our two year old had more then enough room to spread out his books and read on the bed or the couch. He was in heaven, and WE loved that we weren't right on top of each other. 2. The toiletries. I know it's silly, but the soaps were AMAZING! I wish I could have bought a \"regular size\" set to take home with me. 3.

We usually stay at a hotel downtown but their rates were bumped up for parents weekend so we decided to try another hotel. We made the mistake of booking at the Orlando. The staff was nice and welcoming when we checked in. After we settled into the room, we noticed a funny smell in the bathroom (a sulphur smell) but hurried out to grab some lunch. When we got back to the room, I decided to take a shower and wash my hair before attending our night game. The soap and shampoo fragrance masked the odor but of course when I got out of the shower, I had to spend some time at the sink getting my hair dry and styled and apply makeup. By the time I was done (and I was rushing), I was very afraid I would literally throw up my lunch. The smell was just horrid. We called the front desk and they dispatched an engineer to check out the smell. When he arrived, he walked in the bathroom, took a few sniffs around the toilet and said it definitely smelled bad and asked if we would like a different room. Gee? Yuh think? I told him we did and he said he would inform the front desk. My husband went into the bathroom after the engineer left and he sniffed around and determined the smell was actually coming from the bypass drain in the sink. He called the front desk and told them that we discovered where the smell was coming from that the engineer was unable to determine and thought that info might help. They told us that there were no other rooms available at the time but they would move us once there were. About 2 hours later, we were finally moved to another room which did not smell. The bathroom was much nicer than the original bathroom which had mold in the shower/tub area, a very poorly patched and partly molding ceiling, and a chipped vanity counter. FYI - we had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and heard about the outdated bathrooms but we were told all the bathrooms now were updated. If that is the case, they did a very cheap job considering the grouting is already molding, wallpaper peeling, and counter top chipping. In all fairness to the hotel, the staff was very nice and helped us with meal reservations in the area. When we left, we were told by the front desk staff that they noticed we had booked some other weekends and would make sure we had nice rooms when we returned. We decided that the location was not as convenient as our regular hotel and the hotel in general was much nicer so we went on-line to the Orlando website and cancelled the other 2 weekends we had reserved. Fast forward 2 weeks and we headed off to LA for the next game weekend and a stay at our regular hotel. During our stay, we noticed that we had received an email from the front desk staff at the Orlando saying they were looking forward to our visit. When we got home, we e-mailed them to say that we cancelled our reservations (and referenced the cancellation numbers) as the our regular hotel was more geographically convenient for us (we didn't go into all the stink issues) and wanted to be sure we were not charged a \"no show\" fee. Sure enough after some research on their end, they sent us an email apologizing for having charged a no show fee due to \"a glitch in our system\" and assured us they had already issued a refund.

We are self-sufficient people who chose to haul our own luggage. Because we had several suitcases, evening gown and tuxedos bags, we needed to use a luggage cart.

When turning on the tap the water would not drain away but fill the sink up. The toilet flush was very weak. Then there was a constant noise coming out of the A/C opening even though it was completely turned off. This was very annoying at night. The next day I complained about it. Later I found out myself by opening the bathroom ceiling that several water pipes passed behind the A/C opening which were running all the time. Who could sleep with that noise?

I checked Tripadvisor and the reviews for the Thompson were awful. I called the hotel back and asked if there was anything that could be done to rectify this situation. She was very nice but no. The Orlando would pick up the charge for the Thompson. Needless to say, the reviews on the Thompson were spot on. Small rooms, no coffee maker (which the Orlando indicates they have and for which I spent an extra $25 for coffee in the AM), and upon check out they attempted to charge me $30 for parking. Further, they charged me about $50 more than the cost of the Orlando. So, I didn't get to stay at the Orlando at the very last minute, I paid more for a hotel I did not like, and I sent an email to the Orlando asking them to request the Thompson refund the overage with no response.

The area was quiet and we felt safe at night walking around. The hotels restaurant was very nice at both breakfast time and dinner time. Joans on third is a two minute walk from the hotel and is a lovely place to have breakfast.

What a delightful gem in the middle of Beverly Hills! Arriving late into the evening, we drove up in our rental car to be greeted without any wait by friendly attendants. Upon entering, the lobby was awash in candlelight, as votives were lit on nearby tables. Check in was a breeze and before we knew it we were looking out over the surrounding area twinkling as only L.A. does. Service here, while California laid back, was excellent. We called down for extra sugar and creamer and it seemed he was waiting outside our door - it was so quick. In fact, our every request was met with courtesy and superb promptness. The room reminded me of the Swissotel in London. It was clean, modern, and with all the creature comforts including robes (heavy), slippers, in room coffee, hair dryers, and a very nice bathroom vanity which was supplied with Bulgari toiletries. The bed was plushly adorned and very comfortable and room service did a great job. In room TV is a wall mounted very large screen and local and national newspapers are available every morning. This place is intimate, modern, clean and delightful and worth every reasonable penny. Now for the best part - we booked our room at $299 a night for a king sized bed, which also included breakfast in thehotel restaurant downstairs. It's small and delicious with fresh fruits, eggs done-any- style and more. Parking was $26. Now even better - this was all in the heart of downtown Beverly Hills...so close you can walk to everything or take a very short drive to Melrose for even more fantabulous shopping which a good New York girl like me did!

The staff were friendly and helpful and the lobby and TV Room nearby are relaxing touches if you've been out on the town for a while. The rooms have a modern feel and are nicely decorated, however you can sense that underneath the exterior is an outdated, dusty older hotel room. The bathrooms are the most outdated with cheap lavatories and bad tub / shower fixtures. Throughout there is also a lot of dust accumulated around vents and in corners. A spider greeted us as we entered our room, although we had no further bug issues. We had a pool view that was nice, but much of the surrounding buildings look run down and dirty. The location is the highlight of the hotel. You can walk to the Beverly Center shopping mall, the 3rd & Fairfax farmer's market, or the shops and restaurants on Robertson in about 15 minutes. If you are using Taxi's the hotel will give you a voucher book worth $10, but we found the cab drivers reluctant to accept the vouchers. We also found nearly all taxi's to be in poor condition, bad drivers with no manners, and generally undesirable to travel in. Overall, the hotel delivers an okay experience for a very high price.

The first night was comped although we are still waiting for the charge reversal on the credit card - 10 days later.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix, az", "Title": "\u201cBeware of temperamental valet!\u201d", "Author": "eblkcat", "ReviewID": "UR4110156", "Content": "Although the hotel has undergone some \"cosmetic changes\" in the restaurant and lobby, no improvements were done to the rooms, and they are starting to look tired! The hotel staff itself was nice; but one of the valet parkers was so rude and argumentative after we found a 4 inch scratch on our car - this occured while we were checking in and he had the keys to the car the whole time! He claims the scratch was old, however, once you ran your hand over it, paint fell off! Location wise, the hotel is perfect, no matter what direction you are going in, and very safe! But- ask for a room on the top floor - or you will be awake off and on all night by random noises coming off the street!!", "Date": "November 13, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Orlando Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d84561-Reviews-Orlando_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$220 - $376*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8384 West 3rd St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90048</span></span> (Formerly Beverly Plaza Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "84561", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/95/4f/954f10f624e6defefb665ed035b8e0525large.jpg"}}

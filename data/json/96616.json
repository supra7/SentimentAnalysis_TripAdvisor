Housekeepers tended to our needs daily with fresh towels. Close enough to avoid traffic and walk to most shops. Pool was open and refreshing and the boys loved watching the helicopter take off and land onsite. Breakfast was good and hot not a cereal only breakfast.

The front desk gentlemen were nice and friendly, the breakfast was good, it was in a great location, and the pool, although we didn't swim, appeared to be nice and clean. The horrible part was the cleanliness of the condo. Upon our arrival, we discovered hair all over the bathroom floor, pink and black mildew in the toilet bowl, and the carpet was disgusting. Our socks and feet were literally black from walking around. Luckily, I had packed a pack of Clorox wipes and wiped the place down, but of course that didn't help with the carpet. We arrived just after 9 pm and we didn't feel like complaining-we had a tired toddler and we were both tired as well. We figured we'd just deal with it for two days and be done with it. What really got me was that after the housekeeping service came, we arrived to find an envelope on top of the fireplace from the housekeepers, Bill and Luann, saying, \"Thanks for staying with us....\" and all that. At the bottom of the envelope was a word that had been marked out, but not very well. I was able to make out the word \"tip.\" They expected us to leave a tip with this type of housekeeping?!? No. I complained to the front desk when checking out. I filled out a complaint form and they said they would forward the info to the GM, who should be giving me a call to see if they could \"make things right.\" This was three days ago, and I have yet to hear from anyone.

Our family has been staying here for years, my wife and I make all the reservations for these trips. This trip we had 4 condos and 11 rooms. The staff was horrible!!!!! The desk clerk was RUDE. Rooms not cleaned, no towels. toilet paper, I understand having to ask for this once in a while but this was with every room we had family in. After the 100th time of using the tornado as a excuse I told them I was sick of hearing it as we are from Joplin MO and I have not heard anyone here whining about the tornado like these people was. This was the only place I heard anyone use the tornado as a excuse in Branson. No excuse for not taking care of your customers. If we treated our customers at the company I work for like this we would be out of business and we have customers all over the world. We have been making this trip with family members for several years at least twice a year. I complained and asked for the GM to call me or e-mail me, I tried to contact them again and seems that one family bringing in almost $2000 in one weekend is not a big deal to them. Sad because this has always been our family's favorite place to stay. Now we will be looking for somewhere else to take our business as long as they have the staff they have now. I just feel sorry for Dave, a long time employee that was very upset with the way we was treated. The desk clerk started yelling at me in the parking lot because I was complaining.

Due to the tornado that came through Branson in February of this year, this hotel was partially under construction. This is understandable and acceptable. However, what is not acceptable is the fact that the hotel is not advertised to be that way. The website, as well as the brochure we were handed with our room keys, states there is a full service restaurant and bar on the premises. The restaurant was destroyed and demolished, leaving behind a concrete slab on the site. Where the restaurant used to be there were no barricades of any kind, and the parking lot is poorly lit at night. We felt this was dangerous. We stayed for two nights in a king bed condo, with a kitchenette, jacuzzi, double shower, and lots of space. The room was of average cleanliness and comfort. The jacuzzi would not drain, so my husband had to stand holding the drain open until all the water was drained. The toilet would hang up occasionally when flushed, and we ran out of hot water in the shower one day. We did not receive any housekeeping while there, so we got no fresh linens or refills on coffee supplies. The sign posted on the pool stated it closed at 11pm. We got to the pool after 9:30. My husband and I were the only ones in the pool, when management drove by and told us the pool would close at 10pm and that the sign was there from the previous management. (Umm...change your sign, please.) The brochure we received at check-in, containing our room keys, stated the lobby closed at 11pm. The lobby closed at 10pm. No one was there to assist. When we arrived at the hotel, we were not told where breakfast was held. We still don't know if the fitness center is on-site, as stated, because no one mentioned that either. Check-in was inconvenient. We had made reservations with a credit card online. When we got there, they had to re-enter the credit card information. Check-in took much longer than at other hotels. There was no one in the lobby when we went in to check out. After waiting for several minutes, one of the staff happened to walk in. She called management to ask what needed to be done. The breakfast area was probably the best part of the place - we found it on our own, simply by guessing where it was, no sign or anything. Decorated in a 50's Americana theme, there is plenty of seating at the booths and tables. TV's are present, and the biscuits and gravy were hot, fresh, and delicious. The only problem we had was that management began stacking chairs and putting away food 15 minutes before breakfast ended. We overheard that the hotel is currently under-staffed, as several employees walked out. This would explain some of the issues we encountered and why management was tending to breakfast and even some of the cleaning. Maybe all of these issues are why they have been offering discounted rates, but it doesn't excuse the misinformation or poor maintenance of existing rooms. We will not be back to this one, unless major improvements are made. We felt we overpaid for what we got, even with the lower rates, especially considering the dishonesty. Our stay was still an enjoyable one, because we chose not to let these inconveniences get to us. The hotel is in a location convenient to many of the amenities that Branson has to offer, as it is on the main strip. If they continue to work on the hotel, I think it could be a really nice place to stay.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHonesty is the best policy.\u201d", "Author": "TravelGranny0912", "ReviewID": "UR133360700", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hall of Fame Hotel this year for vacation.

So, we thought, living an hour and a half away -- we would look for good, clean, cheaper hotels to stay a night -- so we wouldn't have to drive back home. A tank of gas is about what we'd spend on a hotel room (or so we thought) for these frequent trips. I went online, and of course, didn't reserve my hotel room quick enough for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, but found this Hall of Fame Hotel to be reasonable ($61 for one night). We thought we'd try it just to say we tried it. We paid online, check in was smooth, they had our reservation ready and room keys, manager was nice, showed us where to park and where to get breakfast the next morning. As we pulled down the hill -- immediately we noticed lots of tornado damage still present. We realize the tornado just happened this spring, so that didn't bother us. (we live near Joplin, MO, so seeing tornado damage isn't new to us) It would have been nice if the hotel would have reported online that the pool was still out of commission -- that was one thing we thought we'd do in the evening after dinner. We opened our room -- seemed okay, a little dated on the decor. AC worked, albeit it was a window unit. We had to ask for more towels, family of 4 with 3 towels, 1 washcloth. Stains in the sink, cobwebs at the lights above the sink -- but bathroom, toilet, and shower was clean. Sheets were clean. Towels smelled fresh. Carpet was stained, but vacuumed. I slept in earplugs due to the noise of the AC, and people around us -- but that is something I have to do anytime I'm in a hotel room. Husband slept fine, and kids slept fine too. Our boy ended up sick from our trip to Silver Dollar City, so we did not head to White Water the following day. We checked out in the morning a few hours prior to the check out time. We did not eat the breakfast, as he was sick and we needed to get home. So I cannot give any feedback about the breakfast offered. Check out was smooth and friendly. Again, a place to lay our head after a day at Silver Dollar City, but we probably wont be staying on the cheapest end of our budget next time we come.

I am not a negative person, at all. I hate reading negative reviews, and I am not getting any enjoyment from writing this one. Please do not stay at this hotel. I have NEVER in my ENTIRE LIFE had such a bad experience. Our first room was fine... the staff was not friendly while checking us in but they were not rude either. Our van broke down the evening we arrived, and even though we were supposed to depart the next day, the young lady at the front desk said we could stay a few hours later at no cost. A few hours later, we received a call from the manager saying \"Come get your stuff out of your room, right now\". Yes, she said EXACTLY that. I didn't know who it was, or what they were even talking about at first. After I realized it was the hotel, I was like what in the world is going on? We were trying to get our car repaired, had no way to get back to the hotel. It was awful. I told her we would take another night, as the woman earlier told me to tell her by 1PM if we wanted another night - we told her at noon that we did. She said oh well, they overbooked, so there were NO open rooms for us. She said we needed to get our stuff out immediately. It was 107 degrees out on this day, and I walked back to start packing our stuff. I was going to have to walk, with 3 kids in 107 degree heat, to another hotel. While I was packing, the manager came and told me I could stay in another room. I was so relieved, I almost hugged her - even though she had been so rude. We moved everything to our new room, and just wanted to rest. The fold out couch was broken, so the kids had to sleep on the floor. No big deal, we were thankful to have a roof over our head at this point. Went to the bathroom and it was practically flooded. Apparently the toilet had a leak. The shower would not give us any hot water. When we called the front desk to let them know about the toilet and the couch, a DRUNK (yes drunk) maintenance man came to \"fix\" it. He tried to pull the couch out and almost fell over. He smelled like a bar. It was horrible. We told him to forget it, just so he would leave. We thought everything was fine until this morning. I was called to the front desk last night at 8PM but I told them I would come up in the morning (it was for payment for the rest of our stay) because I was in my pajamas, putting my girls to bed. When I went up there this morning, the young girl at the front desk YELLED at us because the hotel received an email from a concerned friend that I had told about our experience. She slammed the paper down on the table (the printed out email) and started yelling about how her other customers bought her expensive jewelry because she's so great, but here we are complaining about them. I apologized, I said I did not email them or tell anyone to, and it was a misunderstanding. She yelled some more and told us to GET OUT. I told her I just wanted to pay for our room and go get breakfast. She continued to YELL until I told her to get her manager. Manager showed up and took my payment. She wasn't quite as rude as she was before, she just said she didn't appreciate being contacted by others on my behalf. I told her again that I did not tell anyone to contact them, it was obviously just a concerned friend because our experience was so bad. Please NEVER stay at this hotel, it really is HELL ON EARTH. I have never had such a bad experience in my life. Not only is the hotel room nasty, musty, and leaky, the customer service is HORRIBLE! I will be warning EVERYONE about this place!!

My husband and I decided to stay in Branson last minute and thought that any motels that still had vacancy would be flea bags...not this one! They had a \"walk in special\" sign posted which was $55 a night for 2 double beds. Not sure what their regular price is. We stayed in a smoke free room on the lower level with 2 queen beds with a military rate of $44, including tax!! This included a free hot breakfast and outdoor pool (we'll get to that later). The room smelled very fresh and was super clean! With a room so cheap I wouldnt have expected any type of amenities but the bathroom had Finesse shampoo/cond., soap, and even a moist make-up remover cloth. The room had a coffee pot with reg, decaf and condiments. I'm 7 months pregnant and was sure the beds would be hard and I'd have a bad night sleep but they weren't at all! I mean, they weren't pillow-top but comfortable enough, as well as the pillows. The TV picture was perfectly clear and had tons of channels. The air conditioner worked wonderfully, not loud, no smells. Great water pressure (I actually had to turn it down a little) and plenty of hot water. We really appreciated Charlie's Steakhouse that shared the same parking lot...took seconds to get there. The ribeyes we had were great, the sides just ok. I thought I'd hate the live singer they had but it was quiet enough and she had a great voice, so we actually enjoyed it! My husband enjoyed the micro brews they make there...the light wheat. I would recommend eating there if you're staying at Hall of Fame. The pool was a perfect temperature, had pool towels stocked, very clean, not busy at all despite it being peak season and was open until 11pm. We really enjoyed swimming after dinner. Something we thought was really cool about the location of our room was that when you step outside your door and look to the right, a giant King Kong is right there across the street on top of the wax museum...something our kids would have loved. The breakfast ended at 9am but they were still accomodating to the stragglers coming in exactly at 9am. Its really just and extended cont. breakfast but satisfied us enough...and remember, I'm pregnant! It had biscuits and gravy, hot and cold cereals, donuts, yogurt and canned fruit cocktail, breads, coffee, milk and juice...but all free. I was impressed by the hospitality of the employees and also the fact that we constantly seen them around the grounds on golf carts, taking care of things. Check out time was at 11am but we called the front desk for an 11:30am check out and it wasn't a problem. This place really was perfect for the price and great for a cheap getaway in a clean place in a great location! We already have reservations next weekend w/ them but this time we're taking the kids!", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "happy_guest82", "ReviewID": "UR68746945", "Content": "I stayed at the Hall of Fame... the rooms where clean... beds comfortable.. the pool was relaxing... the housekeeping staff where funny and wonderful....

We visit Branson several times each year and wanted somewhere situated on the strip that could allow for some walking. Have two kids, 5 & 6, and a nearly term pregnant wife for this one. Due to that fact the walking did no happen. One negative about the property is the steep incline to walk for breakfast and to the strip. If you don't have a room in the first building in off the strip then the walk is steep. If you have special needs or problems with the inclines then you might talk this over with management if you wish to stay here (my very pregnant wife didn't mind daily walks to the pool, but we drove everywhere else). I have no complaints about the room. It was clean when we arrived, and cleaned each day well. Complimentary soap and shampoo was plentiful as was clean linen, towels, etc. There was no excessive noise from adjacent rooms or outside. As I said about the steep inclines and walking, the same goes for parking in some places. The breakfast was good (inclines again played a role in the wife going; if she went then we drove, if not, the kids and I walked and brought her things back). I really can't complain about this experience. The only time I contacted the desk was for some additional pillows, each Queen bed had two. Within 20 minutes an employee delivered two additional pillows I had requested. The pool was clean and enjoyable. The best thing, with an internet special coupon I got this stay for $49 per night. I would definately stay again. Remember, if you want high end chain motel/hotel amenities, then stay at one.

We have 2 preschool age children and were really looking forward to getting away, just the 2 of us. I was concerned about staying at this hotel from the other reviews I read, but hoped maybe the other reviews were just done by people that were really picky. Plus we were assigned to stay there as part of a vacation ownership presentation deal so........we upgraded to a \"condo\" and lets say their idea of a condo and mine are definately 2 different things. This was an oversized hotel room with a kitchenette that I was afraid to use because of the uncleanliness, a very small bathroom and a most uncomfortable couch placed next to the bed that looked at a fireplace and a 19inch tv. The heat and air came from the same unit which was like a portable air conditioner/heater which smelled musty when the heat was on. The fireplace didn't work and after arguing with the girl at the front desk she sent up a maintenance man. After about 45 minutes he got the fireplace working and told me that he wasn't sure he'd beable to get it started that many of the fireplaces are old and need to be replaced. The dishwasher in the kitchenette wasn't even connected and stuck out into the the walkway. The bathroom floor was linoleum and all discolored and peeling up. However the shower did have dual shower heads which was nice. The trim was missing from around the inside of the bathroom door and you could see all the dust and cobwebs built up in there. There was something pink on the wall above the toilet paper holder and we were scared at the thought of what it could be. If all of this wasn't enough, there was a nice size closet to put your clothes in, but of course there were no hangers in there. I wouldn't stay at this place again if it was free, but come on this is Branson there are plenty of other hotels to stay at that are cheaper and nicer. I'm grateful I didn't pay a dime for this place, yet at the same time I would of rather spent my own money and stayed somewhere respectable.

None of the phones were working at all. I didn't have a problem with that, but I suppose they should be in working condition. The toilet is really old and is not environment-friendly - it's too big - it has maybe 5 gallons tank, flushes for about 30 seconds, and then it takes 5 minutes to refill the tank. There were a couple more minor things, but they gave an overall impression of being outdated. The good thing was the TV - latest model flatscreen, lots of features.

The next day we moved to a king bed room on the front side facing the highway, which really wasn't a big deal. You could hear the highway noise, but unless an emergency vehicle with sirens blarring went by (which only happened once), we really didn't notice the noise. Yes the location is congested, be easy enough to maneuver. We walked to the trolley station located on the far side of the mall and didn't have any problem - all intersections have crosswalks, area seemed safe enough. The room was clean, maid service was great, (and seemed shocked when we told her she didn't need to clean our room one day), coffee maker in the room and fridge in the king room. I only gave this hotel an average rating because the most annoying thing to us was that they charged you daily to use internet service in your room, or you could sit in the lobby and use the wi-fi for free! Sitting in the lobby didn't bother us, so we did. They also have an office set up with computers and a printer that you can use free of charge, which was helpful the few times we needed to print a document. Overall our stay was nice.

There is no executive lounge so the hotel offers you breakfast ( nothing to write home about) and a non alcoholic beverage and an appetizer ( limited menu). I wasn't wowed by the food but the staff was nice. The location is great since it is right across the street from the Westfield Mall and 1 minute away from the highway which was great.

The lighting was good for reading, the bed was comfortable and the HVAC was quiet and worked well. Bathroom was not huge but it was clean with plenty of hot water. The business center was excellent which is unusual. The web access was speedy and the printers worked. We didnt use any of the recreational facilities. The breakfast buffet was very good and free for Honors members. The parking fee is aggravating but all the hotels in this area charge for it. There is a fancy, full service Doubletree nearby that may be more luxurious, and a Doubletree Club about a mile that is often cheaper. This is the better alternative if you can get the same or lower rate. There is no Honors floor at this hotel.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cIt is a treat to be able to use the meeting room for fellowship\u201d", "Author": "OLIVER3388", "ReviewID": "UR121266884", "Content": "We are grateful that the arrangement by the hotel manager.

The staff is prompt and helpful. We were moved to the 14th floor after our heater was broken, which is suppose to be the top, best floor. The place looks shiny and classy. What makes this place rough to deal with is NO WINDOWS open, the door is air-tight probably for noise reasons, and their \"heater/AC\" pumps in the whiff of burnt kitchen, cigarettes, and whatever other smells. Your skin wakes up dry, and your throat chapped. You will find yourself heaving for air. I have experienced this slightly at other properties, but this has been the worst air-tight-smothering-heaving-for-air experience ever. Such a shame because San Diego is so wonderful and breezy. I know hotels have liability for kids dangling out the windows, but many properties will at least let a guest open the window 2 or 3 inches. I could only imagine a couple getting busy in the sheets what it would be like without air. What a bad idea whoever designed this! Several times we would have to open up the door and try to get fresh oxygen from the hallway. We are in our late 20's and early 30's mind you, not elderly! Such a shame! SOGGY BOUNCY beds!

The rooms were clean and updated with complimentary Internet. However, we found that the registration clerks were not helpful or knowledgeable when it came to local attractions.

When we returned after the game, our car had been towed! A young man was standing at the curb, handing out business cards to a tow yard. Beware! It cost us about 3 hours and $352 to retrieve our car. If only the Hilton clerks had told us about this! Apparently, this is a situation that goes on each time the Chargers have a game at Qualcomm.

I have done this for several years and the Mission Valley Hilton used to be my choice hotel due to its convenient location to Qualcomm Stadium. I must say though, that the hotel has declined significantly over the last year or so. The little amenities they used to offer such as the refreshing fruit-filled water, free parking, kiosks to print boarding passes, and the free seafood appetizers were what made the hotel stand out from the others for me. However, since they have discontinued all of those amenities I find that there is nothing drawing me back to this hotel. The \"superior\" rooms consist of nothing more than a bathroom scale and sometimes a refrigerator (which I find annoying because of the constant humming they emanate). The front desk service is passable at best and I always have to remind the staff of what amenities need to be included for HH Diamond members. I have begun staying at the Doubletree in Mission Valley, which is just as convenient to Qualcomm Stadium, and their staff are amazing. The renovated rooms at the Doubletree are beautiful, and although they also charge for parking you can find ample free street parking surrounding the hotel. Given the choice, I would highly recommend staying at the Doubletree over the Mission Valley Hilton. The service, location, rooms, and amenities far exceed the MVH. I find nothing about the MVH that makes it stand out any longer. If you're looking for an average hotel at an above-average price then you will be fine at this hotel.

I drove from LA and the Hotel's location was very convenient to the freeways. My room was clean and comfortable. The maid service was excellent. The restaurant food was average and service was a bit slow (room service was actually faster) but that didn't bother me because there are lots of great restaurants nearby. The Hilton gift shop was a pleasant surprise. It carried a lot of things I didn't expect and has a friendly staff. The business center was adequate. I was able to print documents, make copies and send a fax. There is also a Kinko's about three miles away (for color copies). There is a daily charge for internet. I did not try the pool or fitness center, so I cannot comment on those amenities. The front desk recommended valet parking. I used my car twice during my stay. The first time, I was in and out without a hitch. The second time they couldn't find my car keys. It took them more than 30 minutes to finally locate my keys, but I did not complain. I didn't use my car again until I checked out. I was due to check out Wednesday morning, but decided to leave late Tuesday night instead. I packed my car and was happy to be returning home. As I began to drive away, I noticed that my seat and steering wheel had been moved - not a big deal. Then I saw that my radio was tuned to Sirius (which I had cancelled). It was dark and I was having trouble seeing. Then I realized my automatic lights had been shut off. There I was driving on Route 15 at night in traffic without lights. Why would someone do that? The valet service ruined an otherwise enjoyable stay at the Hilton Mission Valley. I will not be staying there again. If you stay there and bring a car, my advice is to use self-parking.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNeeds Granted Before Ask\u201d", "Author": "GY J", "ReviewID": "UR117471508", "Content": "I highly praise the Hilton San Deigo Mission Valley TEAM for its efficiency and professionalism.

Self-parking at this hotel is $14 a night. The bathroom was clean and big enough but the toilet was tipped to the side which made everyone feel like they were falling off of it. The bathroom also had a pocket door which was very noisy and hard to open and close. The beds are double beds. The sheets and mattress were fine, but with the beds being so small it was hard to get comfortable. The room had a flat screen tv, but everything else was pretty dated. The room appeared clean enough with the exception of several fairly large red stains on the carpet. I didn't bother to look close enough to try and figure out what it was. As mentioned in other reviews, the walls are extremely thin. We could hear even the slightest sounds coming from the other rooms. We stayed on the side away from the freeway so we didn't hear any freeway noise. The a/c didn't work too well, so the room was pretty warm most of the time. Housekeeping did bring us extra towels quickly when we requested them, but when we came back to the room after they had cleaned, they left the toilet paper roll bar on the sink with no toilet paper anywhere to be found. The first night we all wanted to go to sleep early as we were getting up early the next day. We heard very loud music, but figured it would end soon. It didn't. At 11:00 pm my husband finally went down to the lobby to complain. Turns out that the hotel had rented out a ballroom on the first floor to a very large Salsa party group. We were on the 8th floor and couldn't believe how loud it was. The front desk apologized but told him the party would be going until 1:00 am. When he got back to the room and told me what was going on, I called down to the lobby myself to complain and I was told that the party group rented a room just like we did so they could do what they wished. I was also told that I could check out if it bothered me. With 2 kids at 11:30 at night, that is not an option. Since I had used Priceline the only comp I could get was parking so I asked for that, the employee comped the parking and then hung up on me.

The only good thing I have to say about the Hilton Mission Valley is that the manager \"Amy\" facilitated the quick resolution of the block off my credit (not debit) card, which was STILL on hold 3 days after I arrived, which I think is ridiculous.

I booked it two weeks in advance to avoid the busy eventful weekend bookings to come. The hotel is located right off of the freeway. It is located near a great mall, grocery store, fast food, and other shopping goodies. The workout room is quite large and lovely as well. Plenty of exercise equipment, cold towels, and adjustable temps. Large portions with room service meals as well. Now What to Watch For! *Noise- Yes the walls are thin and you can hear kids screaming down the halls or above you (one morning heard a Banshee of a child screaming about something), but it is really more of a timing issue. By the weekend I found the hotel to be quiet oddly enough. I even had a back facing room towards the trees (two weeks in advance booking on official website) Bring some earplugs and you should get a restful night's sleep! The reviews on here aren't lying! I was prepared for it just in case. *Bed Bugs-Yes all hotels have bed bugs, even the nice ones! The beds are comfortable though and luckily didn't get bitten, but I do make sure to do most of my sleeping on top of the covers. Bed bugs like to hide in drawers, under picture frames, in mattress seams, and anywhere else they know they can get to a host for feeding. Make sure to always check the mattress seams wherever you stay! Always keep suitcases away from the beds. Keeping them on the desk or suitcase fold out are wise choices. You don't want to bring back any critters with you. *Parking-Parking is $14 dollars a day whether your leave or stay in. It's worth the cost though if you want easy access to the freeway for events N and S. You must visit Balboa Park and La Jolla Cove! *Internet-$9.95 for 24 hour use. Only recommend it if you want to touch base with someone or do some research. It's not worth it though. Overall the Hilton Mission Valley is not a bad place to stay for a nice visit to San Diego.

Whenever anyone in any room (it seems) turns on or off the water there is a loud banging sound. The plumbing woes continue with a very inconsistent water pressure and temperature. You will be taking a shower and suddenly the pressure drops and the temperature jumps up to scalding hot or falls to freezing cold (I guess it depends on whether your neighbor opened up the hot or cold taps). We only had breakfast in the restaurant. It was pretty expensive. $40 for two buffets. Children are free at the buffet, but my daughter likes her eggs done a particular way which was not on the buffet, so boom, another $10. They also don't have whole milk, which is all my daughter would drink. There is no mini-bar refrigerator in the rooms either so no way to keep milk even if you buy it. This was a major hassle for us. The coffee maker in the room malfunctioned, and they didn't replenish the supplies anyway. The last straw was the business center. The wait to use a computer was more than 30 minutes all the time.

When I checked in, I presented my e-check in confirmation with the assigned room number on the executive floor. The agent presented my keys and proceeded up to my room. Half way up on the elevator; I looked in my package and noticed I was now on a room on another floor. My original room number had been crossed out (it was the confirmed room number from my e-check in). I went back down to the front desk to ask why my room had been changed, not to mention that the agent never informed me of this change when I checked in and proceeded up to the floor I thought I was on. The agent apologized and stated that the floor of my room number was also considered an executive floor. I stated that I understood, but as a benefit of being a Diamond member is to secure a room prior to check in only to have it changed, what is the purpose of this benefit. He stated that my original room was available and gave me new keys to that room. Room - Very average/basic - especially for a room on the executive floor. Very small, old out dated furniture. Other reviews are accurate about the state of the rooms. Turned on the TV, wouldn't turn on. The batteries were dead in the remote. Turned on the TV manually, the closed caption was on and could not be manually turned off. Called the front desk, they informed me that someone from facilities would be right up with batteries.

Took approx., 50 mins. Not much else to say other than it was a very average room, comfortable bed, nothing special for an executive floor. Executive Lounge - Very nice. Evening service had honor bar, fridge stocked with sodas and water. A couple of hot items and desserts. Lounge was better than most I've stayed at State side. Am service was equally good. No complaints. Parking Charge - Standard at most Hilton properties. Location - Central to downtown, La Jolla. Close to shopping and restaurants. Gym - Very outdated.

I understand that parking is at a premium, but why not just have a reader at the barrier that reads your room key and raises the barrier if you are a guest? Making guests pay outrageous fees for parking is not the way to show that you are looking out for guests and creating a good relationship. I booked through Priceline, so the parking was ok, but if I had to pay full price I wouldn't book. The rooms are ok. In fact they are pretty nice, with nice beds.

The only larger room would be the presidential suite or joining rooms. The presidential suite was huge, however it had a queen sized murphy bed. We choose the presidential suite. The staff at the front desk were not sure if we could change our room to the presidential suite since we had reserved the room through Travelocity. As a result we had to call back the next day. The manager said it would be no problem. However, it would cost us an addition $50 a day. We took the new room. My bride to be returned to her room the night before the wedding to find the TV remote not working. Someone came up with new batteries. She always reads in bed before she goes to sleep to relax herself. Before getting into bed she realized the light bulbs above the Murphy Bed were out. Again, someone came to replace the bulbs. Prior to getting into bed she knelt down to pray and was disgusted when she found the sheets to be dirty and look like their were a couple of bugs. This is when I received a frantic call at about 12am the morning before we were to be wed. She said she could not sleep in the room with the bed the way it was and that they were going to move all of her stuff to another presidential suite on another floor. I said that was ridiculous. I suggested the management open the attached room to the presidential suite to us at no extra cost. They obliged.

Not the Best, Not the Worst\u201d", "Author": "Love2Travel4Fun", "ReviewID": "UR22005673", "Content": "Minor Problems: I stayed here for over a week for a conference being held at the hotel. When I checked in, my reservation was wrong but they quickly fixed the problem. My first room was very clean. Unfortunately, the water pressure in the shower was not very good to start with and then it would back way off once you had soap in your hair. I tried to deal with it for the first few days and tried to shower earlier or later than the usual rush, but it didn't matter. The staff told me that they have trouble with the pressure and that the water comes from a main line in the middle of the building so if you're close to the middle you have better pressure. The hotel was very accommodating and switched my luggage while I was at the conference that day. The second room was better but it still had the same problems (and a dirty toilet!). Once the toilet was cleaned, I was set for the rest of my stay. The A/C did not work very well in either room - the room would cool to 75 degrees even though the thermostat was set as low as it could go. Housekeeping kept the room clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and there were always fresh towels. Although the hotel just underwent a renovation, the rooms still look rather dated . . . especially the bathroom. The white tile in the shower looks very old. The furniture and rug were in good condition though - just dated. The location -- there is an 8 lane highway in between you and other restaurants and shopping. You can get to the other places but you have to walk two blocks to the light, cross the bridge over the freeway and a little further to get there. I suppose you could drive too. It's about a 1.5 mile walk to the Mission Valley trolley stop. Otherwise, there isn't much by the hotel -- you are limited to a Japanese Steakhouse, Dennys, Wendys or a Beni-Hanna on the hotel-side of the freeway. Relation to Downtown: You have to catch the trolley to downtown San Diego. The trolley is very cheap and relatively easy to use. It has a color coded map. You can buy a 2 hour pass ($2.50) or a day pass ($5). The hotel is about a $20 taxi ride from the Zoo. And about $25 to the airport by taxi. My understanding is that the beaches and La Jolla are about a 10-15 minute car ride from the hotel. As usual, the Hilton charges you for everything. $9.95 a day for internet (you can only purchase daily, not hourly). The restaurant in the hotel is very expensive but the food is decent. The lobby had fun decorations. The hotel had a pool -- I didn't use it. The fitness room was very crowded - they basically turned two hotel rooms into the fitness room. It had the usual equipment. The hotel was good enough for a business traveler. If you plan to tour San Diego, you might want to stay at a hotel closer to the city or make sure you have a rental car and are willing to pay the expensive parking fees.

Didn't try dinner why when so much else in town. Small business center but servicable. Really in middle of nowhere although since we had car could get to anywhere within 10-15 minutes ...really.

The indifferent desk clerk did not acknowledge our Hilton Honors membership nor offer any amenities. I don't believe we even got a newspaper! While the room was comfortable, hardly anyone was staying at the hotel yet they apparently crammed us all into one corridor so we heard screaming children all night long. I guess the placement of people is for the convenience of the cleaning staff. Anyhow, bored by the hotel and its lack of charm, we checked out after two days and went to a small, family owned property which we enjoyed much more. Then, to top it all off, the Hilton charged my credit card for the whole proposed stay (7 nights), even though we checked out after 2. I called several times, and the staff kept saying \"they don't know what happened.\" Finally I got a helpful accountant/manager who tried to help. The charges eventually went away.

I wanted to be relatively close to El Cajon, where she and her husband live. The Hilton is right off the I-8 Expressway, so that was great. Also, there is a large shopping area directly across the street, which came in handy for various items. There is a bookstore, Gordon Biersch Brewery, liquor store, West Elm, and a Westfield mall (which is actually more like an outdoor flea market, and PACKED with aimless kids). It did have a Target and lots of other places, but looked rather grubby, what I saw of it. The Hilton had a spacious lobby, check-in was a breeze, and the room was spacious and comfortable. I had a panoramic view of the highway and shopping across it. The bed was very comfortable, and the internet worked. The toiletries were Crabtree and Evelyn La Source, and smelled wonderful. The bathroom itself was a little dark, but they did have a lighted makeup mirror, which was a nice touch. For dinner, I tried room service, but wasn't that impressed with my Cuban sandwich. It seemed a little dry. The dessert special was a blueberry bread puddng that was pretty good. I even got a call from the staff asking if I'd enjoyed it and if it was OK, which was new. I'd never had that type of customer service before, and appreciated it. The parking garage is over to one side of the hotel, and was a little small, which made it hard to maneuver larger cars (I had rented a Dodge Avenger). I also found it a little difficult to get in and out of. The stairway was very far to one side, and the ramp going in was quite steep. I try to walk direct routes so as not to get too tired (because my legs can get weak), so it was a little inconvenient. There was a reception of some kind the one evening I came back to the hotel after shopping, and I thought, \"Oh great. I'm going to hear that all night.\" I wasn't as worried about the event itself as the party-goers who might be staying at the hotel being loud and disturbing everyone else, but it turns out there was no need for worry. I didn't hear a thing. The layout of the restaurant/bar was confusing if you're coming in from the back bar part of the hotel near the elevators instead of the front entrance. The restaurant entrance is all the way to the other side from the elevators. I came down for breakfast one morning and was very droopy from staying up and watching a late night movie. The restaurant staff stood and watched me a for a few moments, and I finally figured out how to get over to where the food was. THEN they said something like \"Over here.\" They might want to put up signage in the morning if you go in the wrong door so you don't feel like a fool. The eggs benedict were good, but nothing special. Good coffee. All in all, a pleasant stay.

Also, a review entitled \"Dreadful\" below mine is, I think, a review of a different propery, as the Mission Valley Hilton has neither tennis courts nor is it located near the beach, as his review states. Hotel: Well appointed lobby with everything I'd expect to find at a Hilton property. Bar and Restaraunt sit just to the left of the lobby. Quick check-in line for Hilton Honors members. If you get a room on the back side of the hotel, you get a nice view of the Ridgecrest district on the ridge-line behind the hotel. Front side of the hotel looks out over the freeway, but I never had any road noise issues as the hotel is 50 yards or so back from the freeway. Staff: Pretty good job. Only one bit of irritation. There was a rugby tournament in town during the first and second week of my stay. The players were well behaved until the last night when they all got roaring drunk and made noise all night. I've been that guy, so I had some sympathy for them, but maybe Hilton shouldn't be booking them on their Hilton Honors diamond floors. Took awhile for security to quiet them down and eventually the police had to be called. Not really a bad reflection of the hotel, staff could have made better decisions though. Room: Great. Another solid Hilton room. Huge king sized bed. I could lay down on it sideways and at nearly six feet not be going over either side. Everything was always clean and fresh from linens to towels to scent of the room. Restaraunt/Bar: So-so. The small, cozy bar was fun and I met some interesting people there. Drinks a little pricey but they almost always are at an upscale hotel bar. Bartenders very cool and willing to go an extra step for good customers. A girlfriend of mine joined me late one night and they made her a cocktail well after \"last call.\" The resteraunt, Stish, was only average. Not a great selection and the food wasn't all that impressive. Ate out most nights. Other: Didn't have rental car on this trip so I don't know what parking fees were. Both valet and self park are availiable. High-speed internet was a little week. Hotel is fully Wi-Fi enabled but signal strength/speed was weak in my room.

First the positives: - Good size rooms, nicely furnished, great beds. - Good location (just a few miles from all of the major attractions and is right across the street from lots of food and shopping). - Rock bottom price through Priceline bidding process (if I was basing the review on the price I got I would easily give it the top 5 of 5 rating, my 4 of 5 rating is purposely leaving price out as a factor in order to give a fair rating). - Great service... the front desk people were fantastic and they were very receptive to all of my requests and needs (some times when you get a room through Priceline or Hotwire you end up not getting quite the same level of service from the hotel that you would otherwise). Neutral: - Pool and spa were small, but serviceable and had long hours. - Styling in the rooms was a little dated, but nicely maintained with lots of quality touches (I imagine the renovated rooms must be extremely nice). Negatives: - Parking was tight and the parking elevators were out of service. In fairness they did offer valet parking at no additional charge though because of the elevator situation. The $12/night seemed unnecessary for the hotel circle area (I would expect it downtown, but not here). On the other hand after having recently paid: $22 in Arlington VA (outside of Washington DC), $29 in Toronto, $39 in Chicago, and $47 in New York City the $12 here didn't seem quite so bad. - Once an hour or so the A/C unit would make a noticeable \"thumping\" sound. Wasn't so bad that we lost any sleep though.

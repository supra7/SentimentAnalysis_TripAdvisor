The hotel is located about 1/2 block from Union Square, and we thought it was a good location for first time visitorsto SF. The \"hop on/hop off\" bus stopped directly across the street from the hotel. We saw few other quests while we were there, so I think the occupancy rate may be low. The lobby is the smallest hotel lobby we have ever seen. They took the photo of the lobby used on their web site by moving out the two chairs they have, and shooting the photo of the mirror opposite the desk. Our only complaint is that they were inflexible with giving us late checkout time on our final day.

We did not bother with renting a car - would actually have been a needless expense. Took BART from the airport and walked a few blocks to The Inn. Bought a three day muni pass for the cable cars and all municipal buses which were easy to access from The Inn. It was simple to get where ever we wanted to go. Lots of good restaurants in the area too, especially iThai just a few blocks up at 720 Post Street. This was very convenient on our first night when we didn't feel like venturing too far on a rainy night. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends. Got a nice discount because of the time of year, but even full price is probably better than a large hotel where you would be one of many anonymous guests.

The atmosphere and decor is European mixed with New England. The location is in the heart of the city, ideal for wonderful restaurants, shopping and galleries and within walking distance to the large conference hotels without the burden of staying in one. But it is the customer service that really makes the experience and this staff is absolutely outstanding; it really makes a difference when they anticipate your needs before you do and then add a few extra special surprises! From the minute I contacted Ann to make my reservation I knew it would be a great experience; she is an incredible ambassador for the hotel and indeed San Francisco. She greeted us at arrival remembering my name and the previous conversations. No matter what we asked, she responded with a smile, quickly made great recommendations, booked dinner reservations, transportation, and then she placed a bottle of wine in our room when we were working too late to enjoy the wine receptions. We genuinely thought she was the hotel owner until we met the owner one evening who also was very gracious and charming just like his hotel. In fact all of the staff we met during the week were great; it was clear it wasn't just a job, they genuinely wanted us to have a wonderful experience-what a nice change! As part of the stay they offered a lovely continental breakfast, wine and cheese reception and tea in the evening and there was an abundance to be enjoyed at all three times. We met guests from all around the world and a short drive away, some on business, others pleasure, but many were repeat customers.

The breakfast was served daily (2 cold cereals, cold hard boiled eggs, bagels, selection of danish rolls, cinnamon rolls, oranges, apples, bananas, almond croissants, milk, OJ, caf and decaf coffee, a selection of teas). February 26, they had someone call in sick so the front desk manager was trying to cover the breakfasts on the 2nd and 5th floors while delivering newspapers and being available at the desk. He did the best that he could. I believe it was only a problem for guests in a hurry to leave who could not wait for him to catch up. The eating areas where food is served are quite small, but you can use their trays to take food to identical sitting areas on the other floors so it was not necessary to eat in one's room. One evening, the \"wine reception\" was in a suite and featured pouring by a particular Sonoma winery. However, the other evenings the wine and cheese was served in the same two locations where breakfast is served. Few guests seemed to find or take advantage of it, but the wines were acceptable and the cheeses were very nice. There is tea available in those small lounge areas at all hours.

When I arrived at the hotel, I was offered an upgrade to junior queen suite that also had a little sitting area. The room was nice appointed, although it was a little worn, but clean. View from room was not good (walls of other buildings and heating/air ventilation system or something in the middle of the buildings). Not a problem though...I was there for the Union Square Holiday lights! Wine reception offered at 5:30 was very pleasant with cheeses, fruits and crackers right at the end of my hallway in a sitting area. Breakfast was also served there with coffee, juices, scones, muffins, hard boiled eggs, fruits, yogurt and other little danishes. Very nice! They also had trays there so you can bring it all back to your room to enjoy. I felt very comfortable there and people were friendly also.

He is a wealth of information on everything you need or want to know about the city.

One night, she left our new toiletries on the bathroom counter but not 'in' the spots they should have been in. Another night, she set our bottles of water on the night stand. The next night, she put them in the sitting room we never sat in. * TV - The TV had Comcast digital boxes which was great. I love being able to look up what is on the TV and what channel I can flip to quickly. The downside was there was no 'sleep' function on the TV itself. This comes in so handy when you want to fall asleep but not wake to a infomercial running at 4am to a Shake Weight. *Entry Way - After a certain hour (I'm unsure when as it wasn't posted), you needed your room key to open the front door to the hotel lobby.

Let me start by saying that I have been a repeat guest at The Inn for the past 6 years. My first visit to The Inn was in January 2005, and I have been back every year since. If you are a first time visitor to San Francisco, or even if this is your 10th visit, let me explain why the Inn is the best pick for your trip to SF. SERVICE/STAFF: 5 stars. The front desk staff are professional, friendly, knowledgeble and accommodating. Because this hotel is a much smaller hotel, the staff here are personable and provide top customer service. Ken, Omar, Ann and Joe at the front desk have been there for years and are excellent at what they do. Wayne, the Innkeeper, provides wonderful hospitality and is extremely friendly. He will often be around during the evenings to meet and chat with the guests during wine hour. I can tell that the staff at The Inn really have passion in what they do, as I can see they always aim to make their guests happy and comfortable. HOTEL/ROOM: 5 stars As you should know if you don't already, this is a small, boutique hotel. Those of you who love to stick to large Hilton/Sheraton/Hyatt/Marriott brand chains and go for cookie cutter rooms, please be aware you will not find that here. However, you will find a very elegant, cozy and comfortable room waiting for you at The Inn. Yes, their hotel is small and yes, their rooms are a bit on the smaller side. But so what? Unless you plan on carting your entire bedroom with you on vacation, I highly doubt this will be an issue. And I also read about the complaints without an A/C. Yes, the Inn does not have A/C but first of all, SF tends to stay on the cooler/cold side almost all year long, with the exception of maybe 2 odd weeks and a few odd days in the September or October months. Additionally, the bedrooms are equipped with ceiling fans so that should help on a rare warm evening. In regards to the common areas, the lobby area is small but the only reason you go through the lobby is to come & go, speak with the staff or wait for a taxi/shuttle. The seating areas on each floor of the hotel are a nice touch and great to relax and have your breakfast and/or evening wine and cheese. AMENITIES: 5 stars The Inn is all about providing their guests with great amenities! -Aveda toiletries in the guest rooms -Daily continental breakfast (incl. pastries, yogurt, cereal, bananas, hard-boiled eggs, OJ, milk, coffee) -Evening wine & cheese hour w/ fellow guests -Nightly bottled water & chocolates to your room -Nightly cookies in the common areas LOCATION: 5 stars The Inn is all about location. They are located near the corner of Post & Powell streets, so this is a really great location for those who want to be in the center of town - especially for dining and shopping! Aside from the hotel itself, The Inn is so great for being in such a prime location! In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend staying at The Inn at Union Square.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what level room this was but it was room 203. Couple of small stains on the carpet but everything else was to a good clean standard. Positives - Clean, excellent service, great location, well priced rooms, good breakfast (although I had to eat stood up one time due to lack of room. Also reading an earlier post about room 501...I actually said to my partner that we should be thankful we are not in that room.), good strong Wi-Fi signal, the cheese and wine is a nice touch but I never had it due to always being out at that time. Staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do enough for you if you required assistance. Negatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Small and you seem to be in the way often. Sometimes I just want to be quiet and go about my own business but here I always felt you had to be involved in conversation. I found it very pokey whereas the modern hotels you get lots of space. The breakfast area needs looking at, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go to a hotel and eat standing or as the post below stated....do a DIY! , small room with no air conditioning which made it stuffy sometimes. Overall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A good place to stay. Good location. If you want to get the cable car to Fishy Wharf then get up for an early one!!!!! The queue was mighty long. If the parking is to be paid by you and not a business we parked the car ourselves with no hassle just around the corner and saved ourselves at least $50. I thought the valet was expensive (and we knew once the car was parked it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t moving for 5 days). 5th best hotel in SF? No. 5th best service in SF? Maybe I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t object to staying here again but will try somewhere different when I next visit SF.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA unique place to stay with super staff and nice touches.\u201d", "Author": "TVSCHUCK", "ReviewID": "UR119996258", "Content": "An older, small little hotel.

Their service was first rate. As often happens with our travel plans, they changed on the go. Rather then returning to the airport with a car rental to go home, we decided to return to SF for a couple extra nights. Not having anything booked and the Inn booked, we asked to be emailed if anything opened up. Before we had returned, the staff had notified us of an opening and booked us in for our last two nights. Having to return the vehicle by noon we were prepared to wait to check but upon our arrival we found a room ready. The rooms we stayed in were the '06 rooms. They are a jr. suite room. There was room to spread out in they were clean and well kept and the bed was comfortable. Don't worry about no air conditioning SF is a maritime climate and cools at night. Open a window and leave the fan on you'll be fine. What a convenience to be able to have a quick light or more sustaining breakfast in the sitting rooms on the third and fifth floors. Over a cup of coffee with a stranger, we discovered we had a mutual friend, how cool! In the evening these sitting rooms were set with snacks, drinks and wine. Staying twice over a period of time we literally visited with fellow travelers from around the world. These conversations at times were so interesting that evening plans often got pushed back. The one time this didn't happen was the evening a busker was playing a wonderful jazz trumpet in the square. His music kept drifting in the open window, we finally walked over to listen.

It's a lovely old building and unlike the other hotels we stayed at in the US on our trip, a continental breakfast was included in the room rate. There are some real plus points to this hotel: location, wine time, free internet and great staff being most notable. The location couldn't be better - very close to Union Square with its upscale shops and the Westfield shopping centre, very handy for the cable cars and also close to some great restaurants (you must try Scala's Bistro, just a short walk away - but book ahead if possible). There's also wine time, when between 5.30 and 7.00pm you can drink wine and eat cheese and biscuits with your fellow guests. Free alcohol's always a plus, but it also means that you actually get to meet and chat with fellow travellers. The free wi-fi is great. The connection here seemed super fast. I was able to stream video clips from YouTube and surf the internet as effortlessly as if I was on my home wi-fi. It was also very easy to connect to. We had possibly the warmest welcome I've ever experienced when we arrived, from Ann, who was larger than life and exceptionally friendly (as were all staff we encountered). I cannot praise Ann highly enough, because I think that this kind of personality is lacking in so many hotels (on our trip we also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas - five star luxury, but they needed an Ann...). During our stay, personal touches included front desk calling us on our last night to see if we needed help arranging transport to the airport. There's also a turn-down service where they bring you water and pillow chocolates. Unlike many hotels, the room we stayed in wasn't air conditioned and instead had a great ceiling fan. We liked this feature a lot as it meant that we managed to get a night's sleep without having all of the moisture sucked from our bodies. San Francisco is not hot generally, so air con really isn't needed. In terms of room amenities, the bed was large and very comfortable. The curtains shut to make the room very dark at night (I'm a light sleeper so this is very important). In the bathroom there were nice Aveda toiletry freebies. There was an iron and ironing board and even an umbrella in the cupboard for our use. The downsides of the hotel (there are always some): the room we stayed in was quite small. It would have been fine for two or three days. For a six night stay, it was too small and I started to feel penned in. I can't comment on how large the other guest rooms are though. Because space in our room was tight, the safe was on a high shelf. I'm 5'11 and had to stand on a chair to try and find things in there. Just a few pointers for those who have never been to SF before: You will see more homeless and crazy people in one place than you will have ever seen before in total. It's very sad. The area around City Hall is worst of all. Fisherman's Wharf is the equivalent of London's Leicester Square - a complete tourist trap. There are lots of hotels round here and I'm so glad we didn't stay at one. The wine train is definitely worth a day out and I would highly recommend a few hours sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge in a catamaran. The queue for cable cars at the turnaround point is sometimes an hour's wait. If you don't mind hanging off a pole, wait a few stops up the street, as often the cars don't leave completely full.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing welcome...\u201d", "Author": "F4monty", "ReviewID": "UR118568133", "Content": "The welcome at The Inn at Union Square is second to none.

Our room was on the small size although there wasn't a problem with storage. However, there was no view from our window other than the brick wall of the neighbouring building.

Our junior suite on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, clean and well-appointed--king bed, big-screen TV, desk, dresser with large drawers, couch and chair. We were able to unpack and store our 3 suitcases without feeling at all cramped. The bathroom was small but well-organized with the toilet and shower separate from the vanity. There is storage in the vanity as well as a hair dryer. (I can't comment on the quality of the dryer as I bring my own travel-sized dryer and didn't use the hotel's). The breakfast was fantastic--hard-boiled eggs, bread, rolls, cold cereals (including delicious organic granola), skim or low-fat milk, yogurt, coffee and (I think) tea. I'm not a hot-drink person so I can't say for sure what other options there were besides coffee. We always took a tray back to our room, as seating is pretty tight for more than 2 people. The other guests in the breakfast area were friendly and interesting, and we enjoyed the brief visits while preparing our trays. The full breakfast saved us considerable time and money during our stay, and the family-like atmosphere is a bonus. We were always out and about in the afternoons, so we missed the receptions. We did come in early one evening when the people were gone but the food was still there, and of course we couldn't resist the goodies! Once again, delicious--mixed nuts, cheese and crackers, dried fruits, chocolate chip cookies (even my husband loved the cookies, and he's not a fan of chocolate chip). This is what stands out in my memory, but I wouldn't be surprised if other things were offered as well. Fresh oranges and apples are available on every floor all the time, and we loved this. It was great to be able to grab a healthy snack on the run. The location couldn't be better--a short walk to many restaurants and shopping and all public transportation. There is a 24-hour Walgreen's around the corner for any run-of-the-mill needs. On Wednesday night before we were scheduled to leave on Friday morning, I asked to reserve a cab to take us to the airport rather than depend on hailing one when we needed to leave. The friendly host at the desk said he would arrange it (I'm so sorry that I don't recall his name, but he couldn't have been nicer). We expected a normal cab to show up on Friday, so we were pleasantly surprised when a driver in a suit showed up (not only on-time, but a few minutes early) in a spotless Lincoln Town Car! He was very courteous and the price was the same as a normal cab. He said that the Inn would use his service only after verifying his license, insurance coverage, etc. We loved everything about the staff and the hotel itself, but the positive experience with the cab put it over the top.

The Inn offers a continental style breakfast, which is served on a little area on each floor, this area is directly outside room 501 on the 5th floor, so don't expect a sleep in because from 8am all you will hear is people having breakfast outside your door. Seating is limited to 4 people in this area, so if you time it wrong you wont have anywhere to sit, and will have to do you own DIY room service breakfast on the provided trays. The Inn also serves wine and cheese each evening in these locations, which was a nice touch, again if you late, you will be sitting on the floor due to the limited seating.

I have to say that San Francisco was my favourite town - a mix of Melbourne shops and Sydney harbour. And the accommodation just made the stay even more special. We arrived much later than expected due to flight delays from Seattle - not a problem for the staff as we were warmly welcomed and ushered to the final 15mins of Happy Hour. Great way to have a pre dinner drink, bit of a nibble (plenty of food and wine!) and meet other guests. Luckily Happy Hour was on our floor - even more convenient. Our room was comfortably appointed, great bed, nice amenities. We did find the wardrobe arrangement a bit strange - in the bathroom! And the safe was impossible to reach for me and located behind a door. Luckily my husband is pretty tall and could access it. Minor complaint and easily fixed. No view to speak of from the window - but that meant a quiet restful sleep. Breakfast was also served on our floor - lovely array of cold treats which could be eaten at the table there or taken on a tray to your room. Would have liked an oblong table and maybe 4 chairs, so that 2 couples could share the space, but we made it work for us. The staff on the front desk were most helpful and attentive.

We used Trip Advisor and located the Inn at Union Square. I called the hotel, and Omar answered the phone. The exact dates that we were looking for were not immediately available, so Omar spent 10 minutes with me on the phone, made a number of moves in the reservation system, got our reservation booked, and was able to get two rooms next to each other. Talk about a great way to start our trip ! We later found that Omar (and everyone else, including Ann, Wayne the innkeeper as well as the housekeeping staff) was as pleasant in person as he was on the phone. Everyone who works in this hotel could not be more guest focused! The location of the hotel is excellent and we were able to walk to number of shopping areas, restaurants, to Chinatown and to catch the trolley or the cable car. The rooms were exceptionally clean, very comfortable and quaint. We like staying in the smaller hotels since they tend to have more character. In San Francisco, you do not need a hotel with air condiditoning (even in August)..we slept with the windows slightly open and did not hear a sound from the outside. Each room has a quiet ceiling fan too. We also loved the complimentary continental breakfast served at 7:30 AM and the complimentary wine and cheese that is served each evening at 5:30 PM (both nice touches). During breakfast and the \"happy hour\" we met a number of very nice and interesting guests from all over the world. This is part of the fun of staying in a hotel like this. Lastly, the hotel provides free internet...we used it and had no issues. We opted for the self parking option and the parking lot is 60 second walk down the street. I would call the front desk and by the time I got to the parking garage our car was waiting. My wife and I work both in customer service-related fields and are not easlily impressed.

The Inn is a boutique hotel with just 30 rooms (6 floors) with an amazingly friendly, helpful and caring staff.

Our room with a king bed also had a sitting area with 2 armchairs and a bathroom with a separate area for the sink and closet. Unbelievably clean - always!!!

My boyfriend and I thoroughly researched hotels in the area, so we knew exactly what we were getting. The reviews below are correct that the elevator is slow, our room didn't have a view, and the room/bathroom is smaller than you might find elsewhere. We knew this going in, and were ok with these trade-offs in exchange for the other benefits of this charming boutique hotel. It's in an excellent location near cable cars, sightseeing buses, major city bus lines, a taxi line, great restaurants, and walking distance to a lot more. This hotel delivered everything they promised with gusto. The continental breakfast, wine & cheese hour, and cookies late at night were all very impressive. They also left out bottled water in the rooms and common areas for guests to take. The hotel didn't skimp, especially compared to what other similarly priced hotels offer. The room was charming, and in good shape. The staff were all friendly, professional, and helpful. When my boyfriend had a question about using the available computer/printer, the concierge was quick to help. We found whoever staffed the front desk to be incredibly helpful. They followed through making good dinner recommendations and taking care of reservations for us, calling a cab, and helping my boyfriend have beautiful flowers delivered for my birthday. I felt they also went the extra mile on the \"little\" things. For example, when they saw us walking up to the door to enter the lobby, they would quickly press the elevator button to call open the elevator for us. It's a small staff, and they smile, look you in the eye, and greet you when you enter/exit. It felt very personable. Overall - I would highly, highly recommend this hotel, as long as you've done your research and aren't expecting something this hotel can't offer (like extra room in the lobby and sweeping views of the city).

All the staff were really friendly and very helpful with directions and also suggestions of places to eat, including making reservations for us. Being a smaller hotel it was nice to see the same friendly faces each day. A continental breakfast is included and has plenty of variety, cereal, toast, yoghurt, pastries, fruit, juice etc. A highlight is the wine and cheese served each evening in a common area giving a chance to meet with other guests have a chat and exchange ideas of where to go and how to best navigate around the city. Much better than brochures! Another extra touch was the cookies provided at night, we got quite addicted, they were yummy! The room was very comfortable and very quiet. We did request a quiet room so we did not have a view but we were very happy to get a good nights sleep. The location could not be better, very close to Union Square as the name suggests.

Be warned, as an older building something's are small (halls and tub), but this was in no way a small room. I also stayed at the Milano (milano is not nearly as nice) and visited the Mosser-the inn is much nicer. I was a single male visiting for a conference and this place was great-I kind is miss it.

If you want a b&b experience here you can have it, but if you don't you you can skip the idle chit chat and parlor stories and treat this place like an embassy suite-I'm not one for b&bs but I likes this place for the warmth of your own apartment combined with the baic amenities and service of a hotel. Great format really. The basics-big rooms for any major metro area (San Fran, NYC,chicago, etc), flat screen LCD tv, aveda products, robes, good styling and good finish (ceramic tile, fresh simple wall paper and paint), good business room, light room(I was on the lowest floor but still had some natural light), etc. Staff were all smiles, and if anything probably too attentive. Night chocolates and bottle water were a nice choice. By sf standards this place was a steal for under $200 during my visit (game developers conference). Neighborhood is great. If your a busiess traveler who needs an impressive lobby, just bring clients to a nice dinner instead :) I was scared when I booked this place, I feel like an idiot now. Much better than a chain. Warning,book a low floor so you don't have to deal with the one old elevator. Wine and breakfast were on 3&5, singular floors might be aloghtloer nosier.

The Inn staff is perhaps the best thing about the hotel, excellent suggestions (especially off the tourist track) very personable and helpful. They helped with dinner suggestions, neighbourhoods to visit and wine valley tours. 2) Location is great- I am not sure about where the hotels are throughout SF but if you like shopping and being central it was great. Personally we really liked the neighborouhoods like cow's hollow, haight etc much more than Union Sq but I did not see many hotels out there. For Union, this was central for visiting the entire city. 3) Included Wine and Cheese in the evenings- a wonderful touch. 4) Rooms were clean, quiet and a bit dated, but no problems to report. If you want really modern / hip style rooms and a hotel, I would not recommend the Inn. If you like small and comfortable, I would. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it anytime and encourage anyone to talk with the staff to get the locals perspective on what to see and do in SF. I would say as a couple new to SF my wife and I really liked to walk the neighbourhoods to see the shops and cafes especially cow's hollow, haight, marina, and chinatown to name a few.... Two restaurants I would highly recommend are Bix (speakeasy style) and B-44 (spanish). Fisherman's Wharf wasn't for us, it felt like a cheesy amusement park, but would be great for kids.

Complimentary continental breakfast every morning - there's only one table in the serving space, so you really have to take it back to your room, but that was no problem. Complimentary cheese and wine (and non-alcoholic drinks) in the evening too was a nice touch. And free wi-fi in the rooms was much appreciated.

Here is my review: Location- The location was absolutely perfect. Initially, I debated whether we should stay at union square or fisherman's wharf. I am glad we picked a hotel near union square especially this one. This hotel is a few steps from the actually union square courtyard area. It is surrounded by tons of shopping like Macy's, Nieman Marcus, Nike, and William Sonoma so although there are a lot of homeless people, we felt relatively safe in this area. If you go about 3 blocks south of the hotel, you are in Market Street which has more shopping and is a great place to find your transportation (cable cars, street cars, buses). Also, you can buy your transportation tickets from here (in front of Forever XXI). I recommended taking the public transportation to Fisherman's Wharf instead of walking because of the huge hills. If you are heading to the piers, embarcadero, or the ferry building, you can walk NE along Market Street and then walk along the piers because the land is flat. Service- The Staff at this hotel was great! Very friendly and willing to go out of there way to make our stay comfortable. We had a late flight out of San Francisco our last day so they held our luggage and invited us to their nightly wine and cheese. A very nice gesture! They offered us use of their washroom and business center and made sure we had transportation to the airport. Rooms- The staff upgraded us to a Jr. Suite and despite the size of the hallways and elevator, the room was quite spacious. All the windows open and I guess acts as your air conditioning (We are from South Florida so we are not use to that). There is no view of the city because the bedrooms are along the side and not the front of the building. We overlooked the roof of Morton's restaurant next door. Cleanliness- This is an older hotel and the first thing I noticed was the smell in the elevator and the hallways. To me, it smelled like bug spray but my boyfriend did not think so. When we arrived in the room, I noticed that the shower curtain was stained and notified the front desk the next morning and they fixed it right away. Also, the next night, I noticed a stain on the sheets and asked them to replace it and they did. After that, I did not encounter any further problems but is the reason why I gave them 3 out of 5 stars. Value- The breakfast and nightly wine and cheese were a plus for us. There is no gym in this hotel but they do offer a day pass for $15.00 to the gym around the corner. I think overall, this was a great hotel to stay at. I am very particular when it comes to cleanliness but the other factors outweigh the few problems I encountered with that. .", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA.", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fabulous location!\u201d", "Author": "ScratchBostonMA", "ReviewID": "UR71707963", "Content": "This small boutique hotel lavishes it's guests with clean spacious suites , free breakfast, and complimentary wine and cheese tastings each early evening.

The place is tiny. It is clearly one of the older buildings in the area as the structure is only six stories and everything is on the small size. The walkways are small, but if you've been to some European or Asian hotels, you have seen comparable sizes. The rooms themselves were on the small size, even for a San Francisco hotel and we stayed in a Junior Queen Suite. The bathrooms are miniscule. There is barely enough room to move around in there and it is very tough to get all of your toiletries on the counter (and I don't have many). The room itself was clean although the sheets were wrinkled even before we sat on them. The pillows and mattress are not the most comfortable. I have a much better night's rest on my siemens beautyrest. There wasn't an air conditioning unit that I could see. I really like to turn on the AC and snuggle under the covers and I wasn't able to do that at this hotel. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, however housekeeping needs some work. We were without bath towels two days in a row (and we were only staying in the hotel for two days). It was ridiculous. I have never not had any bath towels let alone two days in a row. On the first day, there was only one hand towel in the room. We called down to the front desk twice and no one answered so my boyfriend was required to walk downstairs to the lobby to find someone to give us towels. The second night, again no towels! At least on the second night, the front desk answered the phone and brought up two towels immediately. I would give service a four if not for housekeeping not providing me with towels. However the best part of this place is the location. You absolutely cannot beat the location. Literally steps away from union square, if you are in the area for shopping this is a good location so that you can buy stuff and haul it back to the room. It's also a short distance from the trolley end of the line.

I am so pleased to report that all the accolades and praise the everyone has heaped on this hotel was extremely well-deserved. We arrived a bit early and checked in and parked our car around the corner at the convenient garage on Mason St. Coming from the Midwest, I have a hard time paying $22 a day (unlimited in/out) for parking, but the convenience is pretty great and for big city it was reasonable enough. The Inn is located less than half a block off of San Francisco's historic Union Square and is within easy walking distance of the main shopping district, China Town, the main trolley station at Powell, which can take you most of the places you'd want to go when visiting San Francisco. The staff is phenomenal at the Inn, always doing little things that make your stay special. One example: I returned one morning from grabbing our Starbucks (not necessary since the Inn provides a terrific continental breakfast each morning as well as complimentary wine and cheese each evening) and my hands were full because I'd also stopped by the Walgreens around the corner to grab a couple of supplies. The front desk manager called the elevator for me and helped me get to my floor. It may not seem like a big deal, but it was a significant touch that made our stay that much easier. I really can't say enough good things about our stay at the Inn at Union Square. It is a great little hidden spot in the middle of a huge city.

Speaking of sweet...he also told us they upgraded us to a jr. suite! Awesome! The room was really cool...very Victorian kind of decor (only gave 4 stars in the review because saw some other rooms and could see someone maybe not being all that happy with the size). The view was of a little courtyard that backed up to some tattered older buildings, but it was WAY quiet! And based on many of our other stays in SF in boutiques, that was a welcomed change. Being from Vegas we were concerned about there being no AC in the rooms. However, even with the windows shut, the ceiling fan kept the air circulating and it was pleasant. Afternoon wine and cheese from 5:30-7pm was awesome! Serve yourself and eat and chat with other guests or take back to the room and relax. Continental breakfast was nice. Nice danishes, bagels, croissants, great caramel nut rolls, fruits, yogurts, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc... Was enough to get you kick-started but not enough to bog you down so you could still find a good place for lunch. The day we checked out, we kept our luggage there and came back at about 5:30pm before we left for the airport. The front desk person knew what time our flight left and said \"You have some time, why don't you go up to the 3rd floor and have some wine before you leave?\". WHAT??!! Unsolicited niceness?!

We were wooed to try the Inn by a great rate from a private sale website, and by positive TA reviews. The Inn is no Mandarin in terms of luxury, views or amenities, but for its unassuming demeanor and small size, it's chock full of nice touches and has a definite bed-and-breakfast feel. We were pleasantly surprised. The Inn is an easy 3 block walk from the Powell Street BART Station, which we took from SFO airport. The location 1/2 block from Union Square is ideal for tourists--so close to so many restaurants, shops, and attractions such as the cable cars. Taxis are easily found, and many public transportation stops are nearby. The Inn itself was originally another hotel and was reconfigured about 20-30 years ago. It most recently was refreshed about 4 years ago. The Inn is a narrow building with a long corridor down one side on each of its 6 floors, from which all the 30 rooms are entered. All rooms face a little alley between the Inn and the adjacent building--lower level rooms face a brick wall, while upper level rooms get a bit more light and a view of the next building's rooftop A/C equipment. One room per floor also faces Post St., as does a \"lobby\" on each floor--a small, quaint lounge area with a table and chairs, window bench, fireplace and sideboard. It is here where the Inn offers numerous treats throughout the day. There are: 1)apples and tea all the time 2) continental breakfast daily on floors 3 and 5 from 7-10am--a variety of carbs--bagels, bread for toast, pastries, scones, muffins, croissant, cereal, granola--plus yogurt, OJ, hard boiled eggs. There are trays to take to your room. 3) wine, cheese, crackers, fresh and dried fruit, nuts and sodas served from 5:30-7pm, also on levels 3 and 5. 4) cookies (recently baked, not commercially baked), tea and bottled water from 8:30-11pm. Quite impressive! We booked a Junior Suite Queen, a larger room than the Deluxe room, which looked small but comfortable. The Suite was nice, with a queen bed and sitting area with pull-out sofa, chair, desk and flat screen TV. The bath was split and small, but with nice amenities, including robes. There is no A/C, but the windows open and there is a ceiling fan. The bedside clock has a CD player and nature sounds. Although the Inn's literature touted twice-daily maid service, we never received evening turndown service, although the daytime service was fine. Since there is no restaurant, the Inn offers room service from an outside company. The lobby is tiny and was staffed usually by just one friendly person who also does concierge duties--they even called us the day before our departure to see if we needed airport transportation assistance. For security, a room key is needed to enter the front door, to use the elevator, and to get past the first floor by stairs. There is a small one-computer business center on the 2nd floor.

The cons: small, dark passage ways, old tiny reception and old creaky lift, tiny room and bathroom and quite dated; breakfast was dreadful (why is it so hard to get fruit?) and the internet connection was slower than in Africa.

Most of the staff (3 out of the 4 front desk people) that we encountered did not know how to handle the problem, not even apologizing that it wasn't working, or giving us other options. I had to come up with a temporary solution myself, which was to go to the borders down the street to use their wifi. We were not compensated for this inconvenience and crippling experience to our work, as well as our leisure activities. It was difficult to find restaurants that I wanted to go to, or to map out my route using public transportation without the internet. The other thing I wanted to mention was that their elevator does not take the key cards readily....each time we used the elevator to go up or down, it required swiping our key card at least 3-4 times just for it to take it. In addition, our own hotel room required two swipes before it would let us in. It was quite annoying.

The hotel has a quirky charm that grows on you throughout your stay there. The check in was very smooth and the front desk attendant could not have been more pleasant. My suite was very clean, but missing a few things. The bathroom was clean, but in need of some renovation (water handles in the shower were falling off and it was very worn). The rooms had very nice robes and excellent Aveda bath products. However, the some of the towels were a bit worn out and had some frayed edges (not quite up to par), compared to everything else. The living room area desparately needed a coffee table to set things down on, so you don't have to use the desk chair. The good part of the rooms is that they are very quiet (a rare find in a downtown location), however the reason that they are so quiet is that the windows have a view of the brick wall of the building next door. It was nice to be able to open the window though, as there were no a/c controls or vents in my room and it was a bit hot during the day. It was still hot out, but cooled off enough at night to sleep with the ceiling fan on high and the windows opened. The high speed internet was nice and fairly fast. On the plus side again, are the sitting areas on each floor. It was nice to be able to get up and have coffee each morning and work on my laptop in the common area (which has a window and view out to Union Square. The hotel has an arrangement with a very nice local health club (just around the corner) to work out, but the cost is $15 per day (a bit much, as most higher end hotels offer a fitness center or free workout passes). The daily continental breakfast was fine and the afternoon wine and cheese reception was nice (the wine was actually enjoyable and the cheese selection was interesting and pleasurable, unlike most other hotel receptions with unpalatable wine and cubed swiss, cheddar and pepper jack). All in all, I enjoyed my stay and will stay here again on my next visit to San Francisco, whether for work or pleasure. The location can't be beat and the service was great!

We used public transport thoughout our stay, the MUNI passes are fantastic value at $24 for 7 days, especially when you consider that one cable car ride is $5. We used the buses mostly (you can get a map from reception that shows all the routes) and found them very efficient and easily accessible from our base at Union Square.

Got a great deal on Expedia and the tripadvisor reviews were excellent. The Inn was so close to the shopping at Union Square that my credit card melted from my wifes use! and easy walk to cable cars. Check in was a breeze, got in a little early but Omar at the front desk simply said \"no worries your room is ready\" up to the 5th floor, great room with king bed, very comfortable with great amenities in bathroom. We stayed on the 5th floor which has breakfast set up every morning and the evening wine and cheese reception, easy access from your room. Breakfast every morning was superb, toast, pastries, muffins, hard boiled eggs, juice, coffee, yougurt, fresh fruit just awesome before hitiing the sights. You can catch the cable cars just meters down the street from the hotel. At 5.30pm every night wonderful wine and chees reception on the 5th and 3rd floors, great local wines, wonderful fruit and cheese platters and soft drink (pop) if you do not want to sample lovely wines from Napa! Great way to meet new people and get some great ideas on what to see and do. The staff at the hotel were simply wonderful, ask for anything from directions to rental cars to transport to restaurants nothing was too hard. The hotels location is simply wonderful, catch the bart from the airport and a short walk from powell street and you are at the hotel. We went to the baseball to see the giants and got to the park in less than 10 minutes from the hotel using public transport, easy and cheap and AT&T park is awesome. The rooms are a little small but for 2 adults on vacation from freezing cold Edmonton it was just perfect. We are originally from Australia and met many Aussies on our trip many of which stayed at the hotel as well, very popular with folks from downunder and again can't recommend the hotel enough. Would definately stay here again anytime we come to San Fransisco and highly recommend this establishment to anyone.

Sadly, our room had zero view - but it was worth it for the peace. While there is nothing grand about the place, it's elegant and charming, and the staff is first-rate. Keep in mind it has a blink-and-you-miss-it entrance; we drove around for a while looking for a GREEN awning as it said on its website, when it was actually dark red! Some relatively small issues: I had reserved a King bed well in advance, but when we arrived, we were told that due to construction, our room was no longer available, so we were put in a Queen, which turned out okay (and the cost was reduced). Also, our phone blinked continuously, even though we had no messages. No one could figure out why. Finally - and this one REALLY irked me: We paid about $36/day for the valet service (a real deal in Union Square, amazingly) and as they brought the car around after we checked out, we jumped in....only to find the front passenger seat SOAKING WET.

Only downside about the hotel was the lack of air conditioning in the rooms as it was over 100 degrees when we were there so it was a bit on the hot side.

A wonderful location, just steps away from everything including Union Square, theaters, the best restaurants, the trolley, and all the fun shops and stores. The hotel is early 1900's but has been renovated from top to bottom and is very charming and very clean. We were going on a driving trip, so we got our car at the airport and self-parked it a block away from the Inn during the time we were there and used the trolley everywhere. The parking lot is cheaper than the hotel's valet service by $20- they can tell you the exact location. If you use the valet service, it's about $41 or so with in and out service, but you have to wait. The rooms are very clean, our master bed was pretty good, not great (the rollaway our child slept on was lumpy and thin unfortunately). The linens were very good quality. Bathrooms small but what you'd expect for a downtown hotel. I really liked the complimentary toiletries - a rosemary and mint fragrance that is so San Francisco! The rooms are smallish for 3 but we made do without a problem - for 2 it would be perfect. The view is non-existent - looks out on another building nearby, but here's the nice part: sheers cover the window so you don't see the building and light comes in, and because it does not face the street, the room is extremely quiet and great for a good night's sleep. We opened the window, which I like more than those sealed up skyscraper hotels, and kept the ceiling fan on. We did not use the heat because we were comfortable with a cool room. There is no A/C so not sure what it would be like in the summer. If you want a bigger room that looks out on Post street below, get a suite. They have a pull-out sofa bed with queen bed and cost a little more. In the mornings, an elaborate continental breakfast is set out in the fireplace keeping room at the end of each floor's lobby. Everything from freshly boiled eggs to sourdough toast, cheeses, bagels & cream cheese, sweet rolls, fruit, fresh juices, fresh coffee and tea and more. In the evening, a lovely assortment of cheeses, crackers and wines await you after a day of sightseeing. It's all self-serve, very private and so much better quality than one would expect. The hotel reception was very friendly, although the lobby is small. We liked that about it and felt it was quaint. During our stay we needed a few things and the young men in reception took care of it promptly. We will definitely stay there again.

This hotel was in a great location on Union Square. This is a Boutique hotel, with about 5 or 6 rooms on each floor. The lobby is functional, you wouldn't hang out there.I don't think you can get a room with a view. All rooms are on the same side of the hotel and overlook HVAC systems. No problem, just keep the sheers closed and you won't see it. We were in room 605 which had a bedroom with a king bed with a living room and woodburning fireplace(didn't need or have time for it). Bathroom had a whirlpool tub and separate shower(great water pressure). Bathrom was small, but didn't matter because there was a separate dressing room with a sink and long counter top so I could dry my hair and put on makeup with PLENTY of room. After 2 days, we realized there was another small powder room off the living area. The room had a fridge, and water was left each day. Bed was comfortable and the room was fine, maybe 3 1/2 stars. We went to the Top of the Mark, and the elevator stopped on one of the floors there--the halls were no nicer than the Inn at Union Square There is a continental breakfast from 7-10 with great croissants, cinnamon rolls, fruit, cereal and I think yogurt, as well as juice, milk, coffee and tea. Breakfast was on floor 3 and 5. No big deal that we had to go down a floor to get it--they had trays if you wanted to bring it to your room. Wine and cheese were available on the same floors from 5:30-7 I think, as well as various sodas. All was very nice. My only complaint was that the glasses weren't very clean--lipstick smudges were still on them. Had to hunt for one that was really clean. Same for the morning juice glasses.

Those larger hotels where your name comes up on the display doesn't mean that the concierge can put a face to your name!!! We liked the smaller, friendlier, more personable luxury of this cozy inn. Everything was in walking distance: the square, financial district, chinatown, street cars, theatres, and a great little art gallery where we made some wonderful purchases to begin our collection of fine art... check out Gallery 444 next door. Rafal Olbinski, Nelli Panto and Max Pappart were our favoites pieces... wish we could own the entire collections! The fun thing about this inn was that the first night returning from our evening out, we walked right past it !! Like a magical door to Narnia or the Secret Garden... Imagine waking up in a peaceful and warm room, putting on your robe and slippers and strolling down the hallway to a delightfully pleasant continental buffet breakfast ... Reading the morning paper in front of the fireplace and sipping a cup of fresh brewed coffee while dining on a blueberry muffin w/ yogurt and fresh fruit, as the rain coming down outside pitter-patted against the window... We would come home in the afternoon, take a nap, get dressed for the evening and as we headed out, our first stop was to enjoy some wine, cheese, and chocolate and wonderful conversation with other guests in the cozy fireside room. Other evenings we brought the wine and treats back to our room while we enjoyed a movie... These are the memories I treasure from our experience at the Inn. Apparently we are not the only ones who enjoy this luxuriously cozy hotel, as we found it completely booked on the future visits we had planned :( Overall I would have to say that we would stay here every visit if there were rooms available!!!

At least three of the five desk staff didn't have a clue where to direct us when we enquired about eating out. When I originally booked I asked for a Queen suite no higher than 4th floor as I do not use elevators. The elevator was very tiny too. When we arrived, the computer system was \"down\" and they put us in a bedroom on the 5th floor, but when we eventually got up there (the key cards didn't work) it was just a room with a king bed - no good for 3 adults. They offered to bring up a z-bed but fortunately, I had the e-mail with me saying we had a queen suite booked, so they honoured it but we ended up on the 6th floor!

For me, these points in no way took away from the overall sense that this was a great find in the heart of SF.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Inn - personalized service\u201d", "Author": "TravelKate", "ReviewID": "UR6014536", "Content": "After reading the review here for the Inn at Union Square I booked it for 2 nights following running in the Nike Women's Marathon.

We arrived a bit early and were not able to check in early, but the staff stored our bags and offered to call when the room was ready. We did not arrive back until late that evening and we commented that we had missed the wine and cheese reception. The staff overheard and brought a bottle of wine to our room. My only complaint is that the rooms can get a bit warm if you visit at a warm time - the hotel does not have air conditioning.

What a wonderful surprise!!! Location was unbeatable if you want to be in the Union Square section of town. Rooms were cozy and loved the fact that they have a living room section where the TV is located and that the bedroom is separated from the living room section by a door (perfect if one person wants to watch TV but the other wants to sleep). Breakfast were very good, cheeses and dried fruits served with the wine were excellent and there was plenty of both!. The chocolate chip cookiest that are available at night are wonderful and definetely fresh. All these is complimentary. The staff is friendly and helpful. For example, we checked in early and since our room was not ready, we left the suitcases downstairs. When we came in a couple hours later, the suitcases were in our room waiting for us! Our room in the 6th floor was very quiet.

Before booking i read a few really negative reviews on TripAdvisor... which almost made me change my reservation. I ended up staying at the hotel and was VERY please I did. Here are some key attributes: 1. Location: Very good location in the city 2. Price: Great price... i got a great room for around $150/night when most other nicer hotels in the Union Sq area were double that. 3. Very comfortable rooms: while the room was small, it had a very comfortable bed, great lines, newly redone bathroom and Free Wi-fi throughout the hotel. 4. Character: I realize that the building is old, but that creates some of the character. I would prefer to stay in a hotel like this with some style than the standard, generic Hiltons/Marriotts in each city. 4. Nice staff: very professional and courteous staff The only small issue... Parking cost $40/day which is tough to swallow, but par for the course in San Fran. I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels... this was as good as any (shy of the ritz or 4 seasons) and i would definitely stay at this or other Kimpton hotels again.

Then again, we only paid $149 which is a bargain given the location. We stayed for 10 days and booked an Internet special. Our room (5th floor) was fine and included a king-sized bed, two nightstands, arm chair and ottoman, armoir with TV, and desk and chair...all Georgian style. There are other updated rooms that have more modern features. Ours, however, were in good shape. Bathroom had tub/shower (great water pressure), toilet and sink with marble counter. It's on the small side for most American tourists, but we're used to traveling in Europe and found the size just fine...particularly for the small amount of time we spent there. A few quirks to be aware of: the hotel is extremely narrow, meaning our two windows overlooked some air exchange units to other buildings in the block. It could be quite loud, but it actually became like white noise, blocking out the various sirens and sounds of the city. We had our windows open the whole time, and the breeze was delightful. We lucked out and had sun and 65 degrees for our entire trip making for perfect sleeping weather. The location of the hotel can't be beat, and in fact, a few locals who were with us on the Supershuttle from the airport remarked such. The hotel is bordered by Farallon, an excellent seafood restaurant, and Morton's, a steakhouse. Borders is in the same block, as is a Walgreen's for those misc items you forgot. The cable car stops right in front of Borders, but you will have better luck walking the three/four blocks to the Powell station to catch them when they turn around. During the week was a minimal wait - weekends were nuts. The hotel also has great restaurants around it - Scala's Bistro, Postrio, Kuleto's are within a block or so. If you're a shopper, there are numerous high-end stores all around Union Square. The other perks of breakfast and evening treats have been mentioned in prior posts. Same was true for us: quite generous morning breakfast, though it seemed to be a slow time at the hotel, meaning we had to go down to the third floor to get it. There are small lounges at the end of each floor but depending on how full the hotel was, sometimes breakfast was served there, sometimes just on 3rd....no big deal. Each morning included coffee, freshly squeezed OJ, granola and raisin bran, various donuts or quick breads, bagels, hard boiled eggs, yogurt. You can either eat there or bring back a tray to your room. Sometimes there were folks who wanted to chat, and depending on our mood we either chatted or just got a tray. You can feel free to do either. The San Fran Chronicle was delivered to our door each day except for Sunday which you had to pay for at the front desk - just a buck, I think. Evening hors'doeuvres were three different cheeses (brie, blue, and swiss), crackers, dried fruit, chocolates, and either chardonnay or cab sauv. Although breakfast was quite generous, the evening snacks were a bit chintzy and you had to get there early to score any cheese. Again, we usually took a tray back to the room, though we did have a couple nice chats with some folks from Britain and Pittsburgh. The staff was quite pleasant, though their concierge services could be improved. We asked advice on car rental agencies and could have used a heartier endorsement, instead of the bland \"any are fine\" response. Housekeeping folks were incredibly helpful - more so than front office staff....though, again, all were pleasant and remembered you when you came back at the end of the day. All in all, this place is an incredible value, best for folks who appreciate the location and comfort and niceties. If you're expecting the Ritz-Carlton and will settle for nothing less, look somewhere else. If the things I describe appeal to you, you won't be disappointed.

We stayed in a room that featured a fireplace, small sofa and coffee table. Our view was out over some garages and into the neighboring office-type buildings. Because I love the sounds of a bustling city, we slept with our windows open. The room was small, but perfectly adequate for two travelers. The bathroom was small...just a toilet & bathtub. I noticed some peeling wallpaper, but nothing horrendous. The vanity area outside of the bathroom had very little counter space, but no big deal. I have very little counter space at home! The linens were nice and the pillows devine. Once we got the correct cable, we were able to use the internet effortlessly. We particularly enjoyed the little wine and cheese gatherings in the early evening. We met different people every night, which, for us, is the wonderful part of traveling. The location couldn't have been any better....just a half a block off of Union Square.

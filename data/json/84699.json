The continental breakfast was filling and they had a lot of variety to choose from and it was FREE. You get what you pay for and our expectations were not high since it's not a 4 or 5 star hotel. The pool was relaxing after a long day at Disney World. They have a shuttle that leaves really early, I think it leaves around 7:30 in the morning but we chose to drive since we were guests of a Disney employee (free parking). Overall, the hotel was great and our room was clean. I have stayed at Comfort Suites before so I would stay again at this one. FYI, the kiddie pool was freezing but the big pool was nice and warm.

Our family with kids aged 10 and 7 just got back from a 10 day stay April 9-19 2012. I have absolutely nothing bad to say. I was pleasantly suprised. I guess I was expecting a shadier place because of how inexpensive it was. Breakfast: A hot breakfast was included daily, which included 3 kinds of cereal, 2 kinds of milk, yogurt, fruit cup, cofffffee, hot chocolate, tea, oatmeal, various juices, bread, bagels, english muffins, cream cheese, peanut butter, jam and butter, fresh fruit ready to bring with you, pastries, bacon or sausage, a new variety of egg preparation daily (hard boiled, scrambled, egg pancake) waffles 2 varieties you cook yourself one shaped like Mickey. The breakfast room was off the lobby and was airy, clean and quite large, there is also an outdoor seating area. Attendants are there constantly refilling stock and cleaning as needed. Internet: WIFI was also included but the signal was not all that strong sometimes to be honest. Rooms: The rooms were large and clean, the bathroom was larger than needed, there was a minisafe, a mini fridge and a microwave. There was an armoir for your clothes but I do wish there were more drawers so we could have unpacked the suitcases instead of living out of them. Pool: The pool area was fantastic but more chairs are needed. Towels are provided but they are the small hospital type with the blue line down the middle so bring your own. The pool is configured in such a way that shallow and deep areas are blended together without a real clear idea of where they are unless you read the depth tile. Ok the information is there, but parents beware..there is a shallow end but no buoy line which would have been nice. Laundry: Facilities per floor (3) The laundry room had 3 washers and 3 dryers. Both were very clean. There was a folding area.$3.00 was the cost for a wash and dry, The cycle was quite long enough to dry your clothes without adding more time. Location: Mile marker 4. The hotel is very near to the Walt Disney Parks. We were not more than 12 minutes away from any park. Great location. There was a grocery store, restaurants, liquor store and pharmacy right nearby. For the price ( which for us was 64$ per night with breakfast included) was a very good bang for the buck. I would stay again if I was looking for an inexpensive hotel near the Disney parks.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "rochester", "Title": "\u201cWorth the Price\u201d", "Author": "rochesterjc", "ReviewID": "UR127839317", "Content": "Spent 2 nights at Comfort Suites(now Clarion Suites) and found it to be clean and comfortable.

We stayed at the Comfort Inn Suites (make sure you know which one you\u2019re staying in cause there are more than one with in a ten mile radius, ours was located at 7888 W Irlo Bronson Hwy) March 2012, a party of four (2 adults & 2 teens). There is nothing special about this property but it is kept clean, the morning breakfast included is more than enough, the staff seem friendly enough and the rate per night is consistent with what you get (pictures attached). So if you\u2019re a snobby kind of person who expects a 5 star resort, remember the rate you paid, that should bring you down to earth. From where the hotel is situated it\u2019s quite easy to get to and from all the theme parks at Disney and Universal Studios by car. I found that paying a little less for a hotel and renting a car was worth it, cause after paying for parking ($14.00 per day) I was able to go between parks when ever I decided to with no trouble, and if anyone wanted to go shopping or any other activity the car provide that flexibility. There are a few spots to eat at within a block of the hotel,(Out Back, Carrabba\u2019s, Applebee\u2019s, Red Lobster, TGIF etc.) so you can walk there. There is no truth to what many hotels claim as to the distance their hotel is from the Disney park. Some say they are situated .2 miles or .6 miles etc. it simply is not even close to the truth, and this hotel is no exception. It\u2019s about 6-7 miles to the Magic Kingdom park gates So if you\u2019re staying at the Disney hotels, transportation to the different parks is included, but if you\u2019re staying off property then renting a car (bring a portable navigator cause the roads systems are crazy) is a good option because the shuttles provided by the hotels don\u2019t run very often in most cases. That being said, once you\u2019re at the park and you have a park hopper pass they do have buses to take you from one park to another We stayed a few days at the Quality Royale Parc Suites, next to old town about 4 miles down the road from comfort suites, again nothing special (3 star), kept clean, morning breakfast included and for $134.00 per night we rented a 2 bdrm suite so everyone had their own bed and two bathrooms which is nice if you have teenage girls. There is a 7/11 next door for snacks and a few restaurants close by for dinner. If you have smaller kids there is a small amusement park about 11/2 blocks away with some rides for older kids as well and no line ups. Old town is a collection of shops mostly souvenirs and a few bars, on Friday and Saturday they have this show and shine for the car enthusiast. Again it\u2019s easy to get to and from the theme parks from this property. To sum up you can pay $400.00 to $600.00 a night for Disney properties, but we were in our hotel room a whopping 8 hours a night cause if you wanted to beat the crowds your usually at the parks by the time they open and back later at night, so paying a lot for a room to sleep in seems pointless. I have some tips and opinions on the theme parks just let me know I\u2019ll email you back.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay super close to everything\u201d", "Author": "Christine E", "ReviewID": "UR127014828", "Content": "We just got back from a great holiday in Florida.

Breakfast was a mad house but the attendants were very nice and worked hard to keep everything stocked. The buffet featured some sort of egg, a meat dish and waffle (Mickey Mouse shaped!) maker along with the usual continental...just fine. Before 7 there was no one there. Pool was a bit cool (kiddie pool was freezing) but fine on hot days. We bought our Disney passes from the concierge (after surfing the net for weeks beforehand, it turned out we never found much more than ~$50 difference for all 5 passes). Hotel was about 10 minutes to Disney. We liked that it had a shuttle but found for the $14 parking fee it was just as easy to drive. Carrabba's was AWESOME - had to wait for around 45 to get in but we got there at 6pm so no big surprise and worth the wait. Giordanno's was OK - little issue with a lost order but the food was good and portions were big. Best secret was there's a Winn Dixie right beside (plus bagel place, liquor store and a Red Box movie rental outlet in front of Winn Dixie).

Stayed at Comfort Suites. On the good side - breakfast buffet had good variety, place was clean overall, walking distance to mini golf, many chains for evening meals (red lobster, outback etc), small supermarket near by and all hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, pool was nice and warm. On the bad side, both rooms ( we had to switch on the second night) were a bit musty smelling, wifi never really worked in the room on iPad, or iPod, fridge and blowdryer didn't work in first room. Then there's the shuttle ... Good - they have one to all the parks - it leaves hotel at 7:30 ish for most destinations and return starting at 5:30 ( sometimes there is one return time sometimes more depending on which park you go to ... Disney MK, Epcot, animal,etc. universal,sea world etc. The shuttles run on time but it makes for long days often dropping you off before the park opens. Hotel is close enough to return by taxi fairly inexpensively from the Disney parks but good luck finding a taxi ( you need to get a few taxi numbers and have them on hand so you can call one from the park - taxis do NOT sit at the taxi stand and will NOT pick up a fare if you attempt to flag down one that is dropping off passengers. Shuttle to the \"outlet\" mall - is also available from the hotel. It takes you to the Lake Buena Vista Outlets I think they were called. Word to the wise - this is NOT an outlet mall in any sense of the word. About half the stores are just stores. There are a few outlets but the pricing ( with the exception of Fossil and maybe one or two others) is not outlet pricing. The Disney and Character outlet stores are tiny with very limited product. There are two other real outlet malls on International Drive. They are however a pretty hefty taxi fare from the hotel. You can get to them on the cheap if you take the shuttle to Seaworld and then catch the I -trolley at sea world which run a continuous loop on International Drive. This would mean making a day of it though as the shuttle leaves the hotel for sea world at 7:30 and returns in the evening. One final note on getting around from the hotel - if you want to go to downtown Disney (which is really cool too). Catch the shuttle from the hotel to magic kingdom ( it has the best schedule) - it will drop you at the TTC - walk to the Polynesian Resort ( less than 5 min) and catch one of the Disney busses to downtown. They leave from all of the resorts but the Polynesian is the easiest to get to. The day we did Downtown Disney we also played on the monorail to get an aerial view of some of the parks (cool for the under 10 set). For us the hotel was ok - it was a last minute trip and I didn't want to spend a fortune and when you get down to it all we really did was sleep there and eat breakfast.

The desk staff said though my credit card wouldn't be billed until the next day, she could not stop the charge on my card. I asked for a manager. I was told no manager was available by phone or otherwise for 3 days; I was told the best I could do was file a complaint/dispute about the charge later. We decided to stay in fear we'd end up paying for two hotels- no apology by staff, no offer to compensate, no statement that management would be advised or the hot tub would be fixed. In the morning when checking out, we told the front desk staff again, and this time got 10% off our bill for the trouble. This isn't what we had wanted, though- we wanted the hot tub working or confirmation the night before that we would not be billed so we could go elsewhere. I wrote a letter to the assistant manager when I got home, with no response. Also, the breakfast room had no seating available when we went and we had to eat in the lobby.

TV sucks since it's an old box type late 80's tv so definitely no HD. Bad reception on most of the channels including the local channels.

Sometimes they have a small shuttle and a lot of people just standing. -As one person stated, the breakfast area is pretty small. Just grab some food when you can and eat in your room. That's the best option. They need to clean the juice dispenser after what we saw some guest doing. Pretty disgusting! -Worse thing was when this cochroach fell on us from the second floor on our way to get breakfast. If you're not picky and just need a place to crash then this is fine. If you want some sort of service and a cozy room I'd go elsewhere. A few people we met during our stay had the same complaint. Everything here is outdated.

When I came back from Miami, I woke up the next morning and realized two of my designer shirts ($450 value) I left in the closet were missing. My other shirts that were hanging in the closet were moved around (almost seemed as if the cleaning ladies had tried them all on and took their favourites). My husband called the front desk and we were told the general manager would not be in until Monday and there's nothing that they could do. I told them that I refused to stay at the hotel because I felt unsafe (they didn't care). They told me to call back on Monday to speak to the general manager. By Monday I had already left the hotel and stayed with family because I was afraid something else would happen. I asked the lady at the front desk to tell the GM to call ME on my cell phone, but obviously she didnt. I called on Monday and again the general manager \"wasn't there\" and had \"left for the day\". I had to raise my voice at the girl at reception and tell her that this is unacceptable and I want the GM to call me! A few minutes later the GM called me (surprise surprise, I guess she didn't leave for the day). She apologized for what happened, said she needs to make sure that the cleaning girl did infact take my shirts because she wasn't admitting to it (even after the head of housekeeping told me it wasn't anyone external that came into the room, it must be the cleaning ladies). I demanded my money back for the shirts and for my stay at the Comfort Inn, but they only said they would give me back my money for the shirts. Apparently the house keepers are an outside company that cleans for the Comfort Inn so I was given a phone number to the manager of the cleaning company to be reimbursed for my shirts. I called him and he was \"on the road\" and promised to call me back in 20 minutes. After 30mins, one of his employees called me and said they are investigating and they will reimburse me the money for the shirts if infact their employee was found guilty. I returned home on Tuesday and have been contacting the cleaning company to reimburse me for my shirts, but they keep saying \"ooh sorry we're really busy, let me call you back\". In addition, Comfort Inn Maingate refuses to reimburse me for my stay there and considering I didn't stay there because I felt unsafe due to the incident, I expect reimbursement and will be contacting the corporate department regarding this issue. They did not care that my shirts were stolen and did not make me feel comfortable staying there one bit. I definitely do NOT recommend staying at this hotel unless you want the cleaners stealing/trying on your clothes. If you do decide to stay at this hotel, do not bring anything valuable. We were told by a lot of people at the malls not to leave valuables in your car as well. If you do go shopping, do NOT unload your purchases in your vehicle because your car will get broken into. In addition, be aware that most locals do not speak a word of English!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cConvenient to Disney and Great Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "sparklespan", "ReviewID": "UR121141603", "Content": "Stayed 1 night at this hotel on the 24th after a trip to Disney Magic Kingdom.

I sat by the pool relaxing and then proceeded to the room to pack all of our belongings up. As I was putting our computer into the bag on the floor I saw something move, it was a snake!!!! I called front desk and they sent people out to remove it. Meantime I was freaking out!!! It was just a baby and I have no clue what kind it was as to me all snakes are horrible. But since it was a baby I was wondering where the mom and siblings were!! My husband, mother, and children arrived just as maintenance was removing the snake and my mom overheard them say that this had been happening recently (finding snakes in rooms). Granted we live in Florida and that comes with the territory. We are returning to Orlando this weekend and had initially decided to stay again at this hotel but now I don't think I can! Honestly the hotel itself was fine, but I can't get the thoughts of that snake being in my room out of my head.

The next thing I saw was that there are outside entrances to the rooms, which surprised me. It is definitely an old, old hotel that has been refurbished. Our room was fairly large with a frig and microwave, and both worked well. The carpet had the grimy feel to it that old dirty carpet has. I wore my flip flops around the room. The bathroom was large and the shower and toilet worked well. The room had the musty, odd smell that some other reviews spoke of, but it didn't really bother us. The beds and matresses need to be updated. The mattress was saggy and not the most comfortable, but we were able to sleep fairly well on them. I really like to have a nice comfortable bed so that was probably the worst thing for me. The breakfast was fine and well attended by the staff with cereal, breads, waffles, bacon or sausage, and eggs. It is from 7-10 which just barely gives you enough time to eat before catching the shuttle to Disney-it picks up at 7:30. The breakfast was crowded but we had plenty to eat. The nicest part for me was the pool area. It is very nice with a large, clean pool area with a nice pool bar that opens at 4 pm and is well staffed. The person working on one of the nights wouid walk around and take orders and then deliver them. They have drinks and sandwiches for reasonable prices. And they provide food until 10pm. The bar and pool is open til 11pm. There was a hot tub and 2 outdoor showers, They provided towels at the pool. There was a nice safe in the room that we used several times, and it worked well. The wifi worked fine. The shuttle to Disney-Epcot was really nice; with air conditioning, and professional, and prompt-don't be late because they do not wait.

The downside is that there is no separate dressing area with a basin outside the bathroom so it's difficult for more than one person to get ready at a time. Instead of a hanging rail, there's a free-standing wardrobe which was a bit too small to accommodate all our clothes. However, in general there's very little to find fault with here.

You can even make your own Mickey Mouse waffles which, of course, is a big hit with all the little kids...and my teenage sons and husband! Free coffee and tea are available all day long.

We stayed in the king suite and it had a couch, table, fridge, microwave, safe, TV, etc... Each night we were easily able to park in front our room and the parking lot was well lit and monitored. The breakfast at 7AM was AMAZING. They served pastries, juices, waffles, and a hot item. One morning it was scrambled eggs/sausage...another morning it was ham and cheese omelets.. The breakfast was well worth it. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. You can't beat it for the price. It is very close to all the theme parks. If I had to have a gripe, I would mention that some of the complimentary shuttles leave too late. For example, when we were there, the magic kingdom shuttle left at 10:30AM. The park opens at 9AM and we wanted to get there early, so we ended up driving ourself. I know that is nitpicky, but truly that is the only thing negative I can think of.

The grounds are very nice and the room, though simple, was relatively roomy enough. The breakfast was adequate for a free offering. Our major complaints are threefold. First, the lighting in the rooms is terrible. There are too few lights and too low wattage. Secondly, we found the cleanliness of our room really deteriorated over our stay. Our bathroom floor was not swept or mopped for the entire 2 weeks and even the dead bug that appeared on the floor mid-vacation was still there at the end. Our bathroom counter was rarely wiped down and the bathtub not cleaned regularly. Our ice bucket, though obviously used, was not put back or a new liner left. We are very tidy in general and it was not like the staff would have alot to do in a room such as ours and yet it was really sub par. Our last issue was that the walls are very thin and the plumbing very noisy. One morning around 6am we shot out of bed because it sounded like a machine gun was going off in our room only to realize our neighbors had simply turned on their shower. This was a regular problem and not just this one time. I think that if the place were advertised as a 2 star you might think it is pretty great but as a 3 it is definitely on the lowest end of that spectrum.

The 3 of them made an otherwise frustrating day of travel very positive. They had us checked-in and on our way within minutes. They were truly a pleasure to work with and for that I would certainly recommend this hotel. But there are more positives to go along with that. The location of this hotel is perfect, especially for those who don\u2019t have transportation. There are restaurants, a grocery store, and several other shops well within walking distance. The parking lot connects directly to the lot of a large shopping center. We found this extremely convenient as we made several small purchases throughout our 4-night stay. A couple of the restaurants offer discounts or freebies with room key, which is always nice. We did not take the shuttle, as we had our own transportation, so I can\u2019t comment on that service. However, all the Disney parks are within 15 minutes. The daily continental breakfast is a nice touch to save a few bucks but also very good. There was something for everyone, including the kids, and always more than enough. Although there was a lot of people in there around the same time, it never felt too cramped or crowded. The staff at the breakfast were great as well, keeping items stocked and the tables clear. The pool area and pool bar were a nice touch that we took full advantage of. The area was kept clean and clean towels (although not full size) were readily available anytime. You can\u2019t write a review of this hotel and not mention the pool bartender Michelle.

You think those big white Mickey mits are for waving and high-fiving? They're for pushing more people into the parks! Two hour wait for Toy Story Mania. Really? Lines for toilets. Lines for food. Lines just to get into a line that I had no idea what the line was for! Disgusted looks on faces because god-forbid, some mother had to change course before plowing into my 8-year-old daughter. \"But you just ran into my child.\" \"You just ran into MY child!\" Ah, the Disney magic. Where dreams are made. Had enough? Then drive very fast to Comfort Suites, where your very own comfortable room awaits, complete with nice big beds that are CLEAN (yes, by housekeepers that --omg--don't speak English as their first language! YIKES! But who smile and are extremely nice and will arrange your ridiculously over-priced Disney buddies nicely on your bed every day and don't take anything like the laptop or cash we had laying around for a week on top of the safe that we could have used in the room).

Yes, it's not fresh off the hotel factory. It's older. Not old. Older. They do a great job with colors. The grounds are beautiful. Our furniture was not dated in the least. Yes, it is a motel-style hotel with outside doors and shared balconies, but the soundproffing is actually better with the heavy outside doors. Yes, the square pillows were a pain, but you get lots of them. Too many, in fact. Yes, the rug always felt wet, and you had to run the hot water for 5 mins before the water got hot enough to shower if you got up before dawn for rope-drops. But, honestly? We paid $700 for Easter week. It was a great, wonderful value of a hotel stay for the money we paid. And the best was the shopping plaza and restaurants next door. Cracker Barrel, Carrabbas, Subway, Chinese, Sushi. Shall I go on? Or would you rather eat yet another pulled pork Mickey sandwich? It's hard enough to swim against the schools of frenzied Disney-maniacs during the day. You don't have to do it at night, too, brother! Clean. Safe and comfy, with palm trees and Mickey waffles.

My friend and the kids didn't enjoy the eggs (especially the hard boiled eggs, yuck). Lots of fruit, yogurt and very good coffee. Definitely need more than one toaster and perhaps a low-calorie cereal option. Teddy and his team did a great job! Thank you! Only downside was the a/c unit in the room. It's rather loud, especially loud for the one on the pullout sofa. We used the couch cushions to deflect the airflow and insulate the loudness of the unit.

Having paid for 3 Disney tickets and knowing that I would be spending money on food in the park coupled with having to rent a car for the trip I was looking for a decent hotel to cut my costs on this trip. Well, after the first night I wanted to move to another hotel but my mom and my aunt, both over 50, refused to pack up and leave. I won't say the hotel was terrible just everything about it screamed BUDGET!! Free Breakfast: I truly believe that all mid priced hotels should offer complimentary hot breakfast and the great reviews on the morning breakfast I found on Tripadvisor were the main reason why I chose this hotel. Do NOT be fooled; the breakfast was sorry! No real eggs, nasty looking sausage and gravy, sandwich meat ham warmed over. Of course they had the staple waffle iron but that's the norm these days. I guess I'm used to the complimentary breakfast at Embassy Suites or Wingate, because I was sorely disappointed here. Room: I HATED the rooms here. They are NOT suites they are regular sized budget hotel rooms with a couch added so they can be called a suite. There is not even a real closet in the rooms. The shower was insanely loud which actually became a joke with my mom and aunt and the air conditioner was really loud. I'm from a family of snorers so I had no problem with sleeping with the loud air conditioner but it was aggravating while I was awake. Further the room had a musty smell. We were not on the side with the pool and none of us used the pool since we were there to eat, but the smell had to have been in the carpet. Also the rooms are all accessible from the outside not a hallway. Meaning you don't walk into a building, through a hallway to get to your room. You park in front of your door and walk into your room. I never think that this is safe, and hate hotels like this because they are really just motels. The Good: I paid $59 a night INCLUDING tax for the room so I feel as though I shouldn't complain too much (though I still would have moved). The lady setting up the breakfast and keeping it stocked was super nice and efficient. The wifi was PERFECT!! Always available, quick, strong signal, easy to access. All of the service staff was really quick and efficient. Our safe wasn't open when we got there; the guy came and fixed it in 5 minutes flat. We always needed extra towels sets and got them very quickly after calling. Overall: I normally LOVE the places I stay and write great reviews on Tripadvisor but I felt like the reviews for this hotel were off. This is like a Motel 6, do NOT confuse it with other Comfort Suites that are in the Wingate/Embassy Suite category. I would NOT ever stay here again and would not advise anyone else to stay here.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crawfordsville,Indiana", "Title": "\u201cHands down the nicest bartender in florida\u201d", "Author": "sunnycanoe", "ReviewID": "UR82428971", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a week and we enjoyed the beautiful pool and the nice clean rooms.

I spent hours scouring Trip Advisor for information and it heavily influenced not only my choice of where to stay on our vacation but also what to do while there, and I wanted EVERYONE to know that we had a wonderful time! I was very concerned about choosing a good hotel (nothing fancy yet still clean and comfortable) and, thanks to all of the detailed reviews posted here, we found the right one. Check-in was a breeze. Ted, the wonderful gentleman that checked us in was beyond friendly and accomodating! He upgraded us a pool facing room which allowed us to view the nightly fireworks show over Disney. We were so ticked with that one small gesture! On subsequent days he always greeted us and asked how our trip was going, all the while completing his tasks at hand. Ted is the prime example of how customers should be handled. Hope he is \"on his way up\"! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping did a fabulous job. Breakfast was never overly-crowded (we ate early, ususally by 8am) and there was always plenty to eat. It was nice that the hot food items were rotated out on a daily basis. Mario in the dining area efficiently went about ensuring that everything was stocked and always had a warm smile. Be sure to say \"Good Morning\" to him! The pool is very important to us when we go on vacation because we do not have one and my son should have been born a fish! I was a little worried about the pool when I read that it was only 4' deep. Should not have worried..turns out that it is a little less than 5' deep but still perfect ! Great place to relax after long days at the parks. Grocery store is right next door. Great place to grab something to put in the fridge and heat up in the microwave. Thanks to all of the hotel staff and also to everyone who posts reviews here. It is great to have real world reviews to help base your decisions on. P.S. Go to the SAK Comedy Club (A MUST---we laughed so hard, a highlight of our trip--ranked higher than the Wizerding World for my 17 and 20 year old and they LOVE Harry Potter!!) and also to the Harry P.

The hotel was booked through Sunwing Vacations and quite frankly at this price point they could have done better. I have stayed at Comfort Suites and Comfort Inns across North America and have come to expect an average experience with as Holiday Inn used to say, no surprises. The room, cleanliness and general appearance of the hotel were fairly normal for a Comfort property. The front desk staff were less than friendly. When asked on the first morning how to get to Epcot they said turn left at the highway, go about two miles and take the Disney exit, then follow the signs. While that was easy enough I would have appreciated a map and a bit of personality in the answer. Each morning I went out for a run, upon my return I bid the front desk clerk good morning, this was usually answered with a grunt or a single word response. Every other hotel I haave stayed at around the world, the response was usually an inquiry about my run or a comment about the weather. The Comfort Suites offers a continental breakfast. This was probably the least inspired continental breakfast I have ever seen. Fruit consisted of oranges and grapefruit (no big surprise as this is Floriday) and bananas if you get there before 7:10 when they seem to disappear. The hot dish changed daily, but if you didn't like pork products stirred into your eggs you were out of luck most days, We couldn't get our shower to turn on the first morning and I must say they had a maintenance man up to our room immediately to attend to it.

Great location - only about 1 mile from Disney so we were able to go to Disney early in the morning, then take a break in the afternoon and come back to the hotel to \"refresh\" and lay by the pool for a few hours and then go back for the evening and fireworks. The hotel grounds are very clean, everything looks like it has been freshly painted. Free wi-fi but was slow and sometimes had trouble connecting. Large pool and very large hot tub. Hot tub could have been hotter but it fit about 15 people easily and we had great conversations with other guests at night here. Breakfast was very good, cereal, muffins, toast, english muffins, fruit, yogurt, juice, milk, make your own waffle makers (even one shaped like Mickey), plus a hot entree every morning that changed. One day was scrambled eggs and sausage, another biscuits and gravy, another ham and cheese omelets. They serve a lot of people and if you come between 9:00 - 10:00 I thinks it's the busiest and they try to keep up with the amount of people they are serving. If they ran out of something (hot breakfast) we just asked and they made more. Only things I didn't like about our room is that the dresser was small - only 3 drawers and the room could have been a bit bigger for 4 adults, and the shower and sink are in one room. We prefer the sink to be outside of the bathroom so that 4 people can get ready at once. It would help if they would at least have a mirror above the dresser. Not really a complaint - just a preference. Across the street from the hotel is TGIF, a pizza place,WinnDixie grocery store, and miniature golf. Very convenient. If you need a Target there is one about a 1/2 mile west of the hotel. We didn't notice this until the last day as we were always going East out of the parking lot to get to Disney, etc - never went the other direction until the last day! Rates for the hotel were running $65-$89 when we were there so at this price I would definately stay here again. NOTE: You'll find places advertising discount Disney tickets (used tickets) - If you're wondering here's how it works: You have to go at 8:00 in the morning and see what they have available. You can get a Disney Ticket for $60 for the day (versus $84 at the gate), but beware, you have to be prepared to lie at the gate as your finger print won't match the ticket (when you buy tickets now the first time you use it your finger is scanned and it is matched to your ticket) and then you'll have to convince them that the machine must not be working right because it worked yesterday and yes, it's really your ticket. We weren't comfortable with doing that and didn't think it was worth the risk or hassle of having the ticket then confiscated as I've heard that they do take you aside and take your ticket if they think it's not yours. Not sure if that's true but we decided it wasn't worth the risk.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "upper michigan", "Title": "\u201cstay here!\u201d", "Author": "wishitwaswarmhere", "ReviewID": "UR56700885", "Content": "The hotel was clean.

We had a great time! It was a great time of year to go. Everything was fairly quiet at the hotel (a little busier on weekends). One night, there were some loud guests coming in late at night, but we were by the stairs, so that could have contributed. The weather was very nice, not too cold and not too hot, but nice enough to go to a water park. The parks weren't crowded except for the time of the fireworks. We didn't wait for more than 10 minutes for most rides. The location of the hotel is great! It is very close to everything Disney. It takes about 10 minutes or less (depending on the roads you take) to get to Disney. About 15-20 minutes to Universal. We could watch the Disney fireworks from the top floor of the hotel every night (one of the highlights of our trip). You could also see many of the Disney parks (Tree of Life, Everest) from the top floor. There were a lot of restaurants right across the parking lot from the hotel (Cracker Barrell, a nice Italian/pizza restaurant, TGI Fridays, Subway, and a supermarket. Everything we needed was right there. There was even a security guard that patrolled at night. The area feels very safe, I think it is just a way to make guests feel safer. The hotel is pretty nice. It is nothing incredibly fancy, but the hotel is clean, the beds are very comfortable, and the staff is friendly. Rooms come with a free continental breakfast with everything you could want (make-your-own-waffles, fruit, cereal, eggs, toast, bagels). Each day there are different hot selections. The pool area is nice. There is a water mushroom for the kids. There is a hot tub as well, which we used almost every night. Good size too. The first night, it was lukewarm but we told the staff and it was fixed the next night and stayed that way. There is a poolside bar (very nice). Some of the funnest times were sitting out in the hot tub at night, sipping on a drink, running up to watch the fireworks from the top floor, then coming down and seeing a baby raccoon or an armadilllo running around the property outside the fence. We had 2 rooms. The one room was very nice. The other was the same, but needed some updating (wrinkled carpet in one area). However, we did see that there were workers there every day and there were 2-3 rooms that were being redone. So it looks like this hotel does try to upkeep the rooms well.

We walked to the Cracker Barrel for dinner and my son and his grandpa played checkers and then we headed back to our room. It was small, especially for five people in the room, but it was adequate for our needs. We only needed one night, because we moved on to a three bedroom villa at Grand Beach Resort the next day. The grounds and rooms are extremely clean. I can't think of anything they need to improve on! Very nice, friendly staff, and a great breakfast buffet in the morning. I agree with another reviewer though that there should be some oatmeal provided. That would be a nice change from all the sugary stuff provided. Still, that is a minor beef for a great hotel at such a reasonable price. It is close to everything in the area, and you can't beat the price.

The hotel has security on site so felt safe and secure. We parked literally outside our room door. the aircon had been left on in the room making it nice and cool, although the room did have a very slight damp feel to it, again, probably because the aircon had been on for a very long time. The hotel room was fairly big, it had a small sofa near the door (presumabley converts to bed by look of it) a coffee table and small table with chairs. there are two very comfortable queen size beds, tv with all the usual cable channels, clock radio, small wardrobe with iron and ironing board. Fridge and microwave aswell as a coffee maker. the bathroom was very spacious with an excellent shower! the room was cleaned daily and kept immaculate. only thing we noticed was that you could hear the tv from the next room and because we were on the groundfloor peoples cars were parked right outside, not a major problem when we were there because the hotel seemed desserted. We only had breakfast once, which consisted of a very simple self service of toast, waffles, cereal, yoghurt etc. even though the hotel was very quiet when we were there the breakfast room got busy for space.

The hotel looks fairly new. The grounds are beautifully tropical landscaped and oh so clean. The kiddie pool was separate from the big pool & had a fountain that sprayed downwards which made it fun for small children to play in. There were plenty of plastic chairs and lounge chairs around the pool. They could use a few more tables with umbellas on them as there were only a small number of them and they were always taken with people who placed their towels & belongings on the top of them but never seemed to sit at them. They have a nice little outside bar. There was a microwave & a small refrigerator in the room. The free buffet breakfast was great and the breakfast room very clean. It had the best coffee, orange juice, apple juice, muffins, make your own waffles, bagels, toast, cereals and always a delicious egg dish freshly made each morning for guests. One day we had omelets another day it was scrambled eggs with cheese on top. We found that the entire staff were awesome in all areas of this hotel. ALL of them were very caring and very professional from the inside & outside housekeeping reps to the desk clerks to the breakfast room staff. Parking was close & easy. The rooms are very clean and fresh smelling but there were negative's to the first floor room we rented across from the pool. The rooms are very narrow inside. They are decorated simply but nicely but there are no closets to hang your clothes only a small upright armorie. There is a dresser with drawers and end tables but it made the room seem even more narrow. There was a very small round table with two chairs in the room also. I couldn't put our luggage on the floor anywhere because there was just no room to walk through. The furniture armorie did not have enough space to hang both clothes and store your luggage bags inside. Who ever designed the room size was way off base compared to the rest of the hotel which is just wonderful. The beds are very comfortable and they give you 10 nice pillows per room and extra sheets & blankets. There were only two of us in the room which they charged us $125.00 a night. We could not imagine more than two people staying in these rooms because they are just to narrow. They should have built the rooms wider especially since they call them \"suites\". It had a divider placed between one bed & the small sofa which closed in the room more. Other than the narrow room size negative the rest of the hotel is nice, clean, new and the staff very attentive to guests. We give the staff and outside pool areas 100% positive and room size a total negative for the size & price they charged us. The location is excellent & close to everything.

However, you have to remember that when you leave Disney to enter Kissimmee, things will seem a little less spiffy. For some that will be a nice break, for others (like me) it felt a little disappointing. Another thing to know is that quick, healthy food on-the-run is really hard to find in Kissimmee. There are many chain and buffet restaurants, but at the end of a long Disney day, we just wanted a wrap or burrito, not a long sit-down meal when we're exhausted. So, besides the hotel being just slightly less than I expected, lack of quick/easy food was also difficult. For large families on a budget this hotel might be a good choice. However, since there were only three of us, we could have had more flexibility and next time I'd do it differently -- probably a cheap Disney property (since food is imperfect either way) in order to get the great pool and other Disney-only benefits.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "kissimmee", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!

I wanted to write another review because sometimes, a second stay isn't as nice as the first. That's not the case here. If you're going to the Kissimmee area for any reason other than a mutli-day visit to the Disney World Resort exclusively, you can't do better than this hotel. The rates are very reasonable, the rooms are absolutely spotless (no weird smells), the beds are great, the sheets are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean and well kept, the rooms are large and comfortable, the pool is and hot tub are way above average, every room's a suite with a sitting area, fridge and microwave; the free breakfast always includes waffles and one hot item in addition to the usual continental fare, and the staff is helpful and gracious. The one thing about this hotel I would mention is that all the mirrors in the room are in the bathroom. This may not seem weird, but if you're travelign with two teenagers who need time to primp, or you're sharing a room with a business associate, that may be inconvenient for you. And we weren't in town for Disney, so i can't really speak to the convenience of the shuttle because we didn't use it. However, we arrived on the autotrain -- exhausted after traveling all night, and the front desk staff bent over backwards to get us in our room early on a holiday weekend when everything was full. The parking is free -- which is always a bonus for me, and the location is very convenient. Our conference as at a Disney Hotel and it was about 10 minutes away, so it's quite close. Plus, there are plenty of meal choices on the strip where the hotel is located, but despite the busy location, the hotel is set back from the road and is very quet. Like many Florida hotels, it does not have interior corridors, but we noticed very little noise. It might be noisier during the busy summer months. The WIFi connection is free and works throughout the complex with no password needed. And the entire property is Non-Smoking -- which I love.

The location is nice...if you have a car. I can't comment on the shuttle service as we had a car on premisis, but drive time to Disney was only 10 minutes or so and very easy. The hotel seems to have undergone a recent renovation and everything in our room and common areas was neat, clean and well maintained. The only food service is the continental breakfast which is included and fair. Selections include cold cereals, fruit, bagels and bread for toasting, breakfast pastries, one egg dish per day and do-it-yourself waffles...coffee, juice and water. We had the breakfast every morning and were always able to find a table, though there's often a wait for the waffle irons. There is one bar on property, the pool cabana, which is open till 11:00 PM and has a nice selection...upon check-in you'll receive two 2-for-1 coupons for beer, wine or well drinks. There are plenty of chain type restaurants within easy walking distance of this hotel, including Carrabbas, Cracker Barrel, Giordinio's Pizza, etc. Several restaurants deliver to the hotel, including lots of pizza joints. Our room consisted of a small seating area with a couch, coffee table, dining table and two chairs seperated by a small 1/2 wall from the sleeping area. We had two queen beds that were comfortable, with plenty of pillows. Also in the room were a small fridge and microwave. As I mentioned, the rooms looked recently remodeled and were attractive, comfortable and clean. Unfortunately, the weather was cool while we were there, so we didn't use the pool, but the area looked nice. There's a large free-form swimming pool, a smaller kiddie pool with an \"umbrella\" style waterfall and a nice hot tub. I wish we would have had time and weather to use the pool facilities. There appears to have been only two areas that were not addressed in the renovations...both of which need attention...the heat/air conditioning are very old units and are not effective or accurate in keeping the room an even temperature. Also, the bathroom fans were not replaced and were very ineffective...since the windows don't open either, our room seemed stuffy all week and was steamy/muggy after each shower. Along those same lines, the plumbing is very loud. I mean these as minor suggestions, not complaints...it wasn't enough of a problem to make a fuss. All in all, I think this property presents itself well above the standard rates charged...much better than many hotels I've encountered in this price range.

There were four of us total. We got a room that was not facing the pool (358). I have stayed several times over the years at this hotel. The rooms have been updated since my last stay with more subdued bedding and decor. Although the room is tastefully decorated the carpeting could use a little improvement.(it was ripped and worn but clean). There was plenty of room for the four of us. We used the two double beds and also the sofa bed. Surprisingly the sofa bed was comfortable as well(that is where I ended up). There is a microwave, refrigerator and safe in the room. We had a little trouble with the safe. It is the kind where you enter your four digit code. I have yet to figure those out. We called and in about an hour they had it fixed. There is a coffee maker and hair dryer also. Laundry is available also. The only problem that I had with the room was that the sink area was inside with the rest of the bathroom. I have never found this to be a problem before mostly because I travel with my boyfriend and we share the bathroom, however with four people (or six which is the capacity of the room) it did make getting ready a little bit of a chore. It took longer because if one person was showering noone else could be using the sink etc. The continental breakfast was a little crowded at times but very nice. There was always the usual bagels, donuts, cereal, yogurt and fruit. The other side of the breakfast area had something warm, i.e. biscuit sandwich or mini \"omlettes\" with bacon and cheese. The waffle maker was going constantly but I got in a few days to make one. They are OK. Nothing to write home about but at least they are warm and the kids loved them. The pool area is well maintained including the hot tub. There are signs that children in diapers are not allowed in the pool area and they have their own separate splash pool as well. Within the parking lot there are all the amenities that you need, a grocery store, liquor store, drug store, Taco Bell, Outback, TGI Friday's, Carrabas. We tried to eat at the Carrabas but had the rudest waiter so we walked out. He was angry that we all did not partake in the 2 for 1 drink specials that were going on. We had asked for waters and he rudely snapped \"Don't worry I'll bring you waters!\" Well he never did. He brought it to the next table that were seated after us. I am a patient person but we are talking a good span of time at least 15 minutes from the time he yelled to the time we walked out. Hopefully if you decide to eat there you will receive better service. If I could remember his name I would tell you but I guess I've blocked it out. Sorry. There is also a mini golf course in the same parking lot if you need some entertainment for the little ones. You can access the internet for 15 minutes a day in the hotel lobby. Just ask at the desk and they will give you a code for it. You can also print pages for $1 each. The only downside in the hotel lobby is the time share people. I tried to avoid them but I got nabbed one morning, she was polite until I said \"no\", as is usually the case with time share people. The coupons and discounts are located around the time share desk so if you don't want to be hassled sneak down later at night they are not there. All in all I have enjoyed my stay here and would stay here again. The price cannot be beat for the location our average room rate was $71 a night for four people.

We loved our stay!! After a 6 hour traffic-plagued drive to Kissimmee, we were so happy to get to our room and it was even nicer than we expected. Rather than the cheap, bright, mis-matched colors that many hotels decorate their rooms in, our room was done in very modern, clean, light colors, with black & white tropical framed pictures on the walls. The bed was so comfortable and loaded with pillows, and the room was very spacious. There was a table with chairs and a couch, plus a very nice fridge & microwave area that even had glass drinking cups. The bathroom sink area had more than enough space for our stuff, and we had plenty of towels and toiletries. We were also surprised to find that the bath tub was MUCH bigger than any standard hotel tub we've ever seen. We only had a couple small problems with the room: the knob to adjust the water heat in the shower was very confusing and it was hard to tell whether or not it was getting hotter or colder until it hit you; the air conditioner had a mind of its own, and sometimes it wouldn't kick on, or if we tried to turn the air on low it would just kick off and not come back on for a very long time--it wasn't too bad though and didnt start acting up until our last day; lastly, I didn't like that the room itself had no mirrors in it--only the bathroom did. It had lots of wall mirrors and a full length mirror where you could watch yourself on the toilet!--haha. The pool was nice and big, but we didn't swim it it. We tried the hot tub one evening for a while, but since its summer, it was hard to stay in the hot water for long. We got drinks at the poolside bar with the 2-for-1 drink coupons the front desk gave us. It was really a good deal because we got 2 mixed drinks for only $4.50, and they had lots of selections. The girl at the bar did not seem very pleased to help guests though. The lobby was actually really useful because they had tons of brochures & coupons--we used the brochures to help us decide on a couple places to go. The free wireless internet was also a huge plus! We went down to breakfast a couple times, but it was unbelievably packed--it was like an overly full restaurant. I felt bad for the guy responsible for refilling the food because he sure had his work cut out for him! I was really pleased with the breakfast selection though--cheesy scrambled eggs, sausage, lots of breads, doughnuts, sweet rolls, cereal, yogurt, fruit, waffles, and on and on! It was almost a fight to get through the line. I have stayed at plenty of hotels, and the breakfast areas are ALWAYS packed--don't expect anything different--people love free food. The landscaping around the hotel is beautiful, and we occupied ourselves one night by looking at the different signs they placed near some of plants to tell you what they are. The location of the hotel is perfect! It is in walking distance of a shopping center, and we walked over several times to eat, once at Cracker Barrell and once at some Italian restaurant. It is within short driving distance of all kinds of fun places in Kissimmee--we went to Medieval Times dinner & tournament and had an amazing time, and also went to Sea World, which took only 15 minutes to drive to. We didn't leave until 11:00am to noon on most days, so housekeeping always came back to our room after we left and cleaned it without us even asking, which was really nice.

What made the experience bad was the breakfast buffet was always packed with people, who exhibited behavior that can best be described as \"Lord of the Flies\"-like. It certainly was survival of the fittest, when it came to serving yourself. Also, there were only a few tables in the breakfast room, so almost everyone took their breakfast items to their room, which was highly discouraged by the hotel management. This breakfast situation needs to be fixed immediately. Until this is addressed by hotel management, my family and I will not return to this establishment.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newfoundland", "Title": "\u201cExellent Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "zoeyNewfoundland", "ReviewID": "UR7739956", "Content": "We loved everything about this hotel!!

I would not stay there again. First of all, it being the height of the tourist season, they charged $149/night when I booked through Comfort Suites web site (Choice Hotels), which came out to $135 or so with AAA discount--no bargain here. There are many nearby hotels, some closer to the Disney approach road. (For those of you who are not familiar with the Disney World area, this hotel is over a mile from the entrance to the approach road, and after that it's another several miles to the Magic Kingdom and other Disney parks.) Anyway, while I can say Comfort Suites Maingate is clean and well-kept, several things irked me, which may have been less bothersome if I had paid $65 or $75, but for $135 I expected better. The bed was uncomfortable because the mattress pad was like one of those waterproof plastic baby diapers. It felt like sleeping on a thick sheet of plastic, which bunched up and stuck in our backs uncomfortably. Such a mattress pad is expected in a cheap motel, but not a mid-priced Comfort Suites. Also, the bedspread and blanket had cigarette burns in them. Again, fine for a cheap motel, but not a mid-priced Comfort Suites. Moreover, at check-in, I was asked to initial that I understood I would be charged $200 if someone smoked in my (non-smoking) room. After seeing the results of someone having smoked in MY room (well, having smoked on the bedspread and blanket that were now in my room), I felt like I should have charged THEM $200 for having to tolerate such a disgusting bed in a NON-SMOKING room. I am also totally perplexed by glowing comments from some previous reviewers about the pool, bar, friendly service, etc. I felt it was just an ordinary motel like many others I have stayed at, with an ordinary pool, tiny \"bar,\" typical motel complimentary breakfast, etc.. Nothing special here. I think you may end up feeling misled if you stay here because there are a relatively large number of very good reviews while there are fewer good reviews for other hotels in the area. I suspect other hotels in the same area are on par with this one. I also suspect that the people who paid $65 felt that what they got was good for the price. I recognize that I stayed there on perhaps the absolute peak days, when hotels charge the most, but I was nevertheless disappointed.

We stayed in first week of Dec. 2006 and paid $62 (week day) and $72 (fri/sat) triple A rate but they never asked to see our triple A card. The room was capable of sleeping 6 - we were 2 adults and 2 small children and the room was more than adequate. Hotel provided us with a pack and play which fit between the two beds. The room came with fridge, microwave, coffee maker and safe. Overall the hotel seemed very clean. Free breakfast was included every morning from 6am-10am. More than adequate food - bagles, toast, muffins, waffles, yogurt, coffee, juice, cereal etc...Pool and area was nice and clean. Hot tub relaxing. Very close to Disney. Extremely close to grocery store and restaurants and fast food all along 192 - some walking distance. I found the elevator quick and convenient. The bad - and this is just nit picky stuff because I feel I got more than $62 worth of hotel. The room carpet had some stains - as did bathroom floor - though overall I felt the room was mostly clean and much cleaner and fresher than other hotels for this price. I found the lighting in the room was not very bright because all the bulbs in all the lamps were those energy efficient bulbs. But during the day with the blinds open the room was light and airy. Biggest issue is that the sink/ vanity/ mirrors are all inside the bathroom...so if someone is using the bathroom everyone else cant use those other things...not one mirror outside the bathroom - weird. Wasnt a problem for us though!! I felt fairly safe (Im always on alert in strange places) but I would say anyone could easilly walk right onto the premisses. Though I feel that is the situation in most of these hotels that have outside corridors. We were there at a fairly quiet time of year and everything was quiet but I could see how the breakfast area could totally be overrun during the busy times. We moved on to stay at Disneys Wilderness Lodge for a few nights after this which was AWESOME!! (but even that had a stagnent oder in the bathroom) and it was TRIPLE the price. I would totally recommend this hotel to a friend. I think its a great bang for your buck. You get the free breakfast included. You get a hotel with a kiddie pool and hot tub. Very clean.

Spacious front desk with friendly staff on the one side, information desk (that sells tickets) at the other side. Some comfortable sofas in the middle of the lobby. Front desk staff did forget to tell us we need some extra password for using the complimentary internet so it did not work out immediately. Signal was way to low anyway. Passing through the lobby you may enter the pool area with a huge shaped pool and plenty of sitting area around. 3 sides of the pool are surrounded by the rooms, the 4th side by the huge lobby building. Unfortunately it was too chilli to use the pool. There is a tiki bar at the pool and you receive a 2 for one coupon at arrival, to be used for alcoholic beverages. The whole complex is surrounded by a parking lot and all rooms have outdoor corridors, very motel style. We got a room on the back of the building, and it was very quiet, except you might hear some guests arrive and slam doors or shout. No noise from adjacent bathrooms, but once we heard people talking in the neighbouring room. The motel has 3 floors and you can reach the upper floors by stairs or using the elevator in the corner of the building. The room was really huge, but not what I expect to be a suite. It was devided into 2 parts by a small wall \u2013 sitting area with sofa and table, desk and chairs, and sleeping area with 2 queen beds. All in bright wood and brown colours. There was a big screened TV with more than 50 channels, but most of the channels were not clear, which made no fun viewing their films. In the morning television did not work at all. We got a safe in the room and a big refridgerator as well as a microwave. No kitchen as you would expect from a suite. Probably cheaper rooms have none. Beds must have had some kind of plastic sheets so you might sweat a bit more than usual. There is a coffee maker in the bathroom and a small closet with hangers and ironing equipment in the room. My husband used coffee maker which was really clean. Bathroom was separate with tub, toilet and sink with huge counter. Plenty of space for your stuff and nice toiletries are provided. Lots of thick fluffy towels! Took some time to get hot water. Nice big massage shower head. New and clean shower curtains and tub that was not too small. Bathroom door was sticky, needs to be cleaned. The whole place was clean, not perfectly, but ok for us. The blankets had some stains, so did the wall besides the toilet and the fabric of one chair.

Pluses included good housekeeping, in-room safe, frig pretty large, armoire, extra blanket, coffeemaker, hair dryer, shopping center nearby with clinic, supermarket!, restaurants. There was a great breakfast with bagels, breads, muffins, donuts, hard-boiled eggs, fruit salad and sliced grapefruit and oranges, bananas, some cereals, choice of teas and coffees and handmade waffles. This was all free! closeby to ponderosa and highways. Negatives: walls thin and lots of screaming at times from preteens holding party near pool and then, after we moved away from the pool, screaming from irate parents to their children while we were trying to sleep at 11pm at night( exhausted!). Breakfast room got occ. crowded. Front desk told me on arrival no rooms were available away from the pool on the first night but then after the first noisy night (to 1 am), we went back to change rooms in the morning. Suddenly, with another front desk attendant, the rooms not facing the pool were available. I had a hunch they were available all along but the front desk wanted to charge me the extra 10.00 for the pool-side room- so I was paying more money for extra noise. Not logical. bottomline: good deal for the money but bring earplugs and patience and book a room away from the pool.", "Date": "February 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool, england", "Title": "\u201cloved everything about it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4415176", "Content": "we loved the comfort suites, the rooms were immaculate, the staff were very helpfull and friendly .the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard every day and we will definately be booking for next year !!!!", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Suites Maingate", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d84699-Reviews-Comfort_Suites_Maingate-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$71 - $117*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7888 W.

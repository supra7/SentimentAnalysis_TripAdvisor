The staff made every attempt to find it, searching lost and found, the safe, sending out an e-mail to all staff etc. But we honestly feel it may have been taken from the room by housekeeping. We left very disheartened and angry. I have a feeling we won't be getting it back and someone has a nice new password protected netbook, (among other things in the netbook case) that they are going to have to reformat to be able to use.

There were also some interesting looking shops and a salon in the courtyard which I was never able to visit because by the time we would get back from training, they were all closed.

This was a bigger room and quiet. The rooms are comfortable and modest in size-the bed was excellent. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. There is no gym or pool on the property which is a negative for my family but they do give you a free pass to a local gym. Coffee and tea are provided in the lobby in the morning and apples and cookies are on a plate by the front desk in the afternoon. There are 2 restaurants you can order room service from but no children's menu or child friendly food. Luckily, there are so many restaurants close by we were able to get what we needed.

To begin with, the other reviews are on the mark in terms of location, charm, etc. Those features are top notch. So, what's my complaint? For a top-notch hotel for which the bar should be set high for details, the hotel fell short in several puzzling ways. We checked in late at night; the night clerk was competent and helpful. The Guest Service Directory had a dusty cover. No big deal, I thought. The room was nice but with only one coffee cup (but two saucers and two spoons). The coffee quality in the room was excellent but I had to go downstairs to ask for packets of sugar -- two nights in a row. (There was plenty of artificial sweeteners but no regular sugar.) The concierge gave me a handful the second time so I would not have to come back. The coffee maker was only partially cleaned one day (grounds were removed but the carafe was not washed). A dirty saucer was clearly not replaced one day; it still had coffee spillage on it. There was only one drinking glass one night and a glass was visibly cracked on a different day. There was a bedside lamp in which the light socket had come apart. That did not pose acute danger because the exposed wires were insulated and the switch was on the cord so the socket did not need to be touched. Perhaps the most annoying (minor) problems were with the shower/bath. The stopper -- the type where you just push down to toggle between close and open -- was very unresponsive and difficult to close. Equally inconvenient was the way the shower curtains were set up. There are two adjacent parallel shower curtain rods. I believe the inner bar is for the main curtain and the outer bar for the \"decorative\" outer curtains. In our bathroom, both curtains were on the same (outer) rod which meant that the edge of the inner curtain could not be placed near the wall because the outer curtain's (which was split into two pieces) hangers took up the space on the curtain rod closest to the wall. The inner curtain rod was not being used at all. Sorry for the convoluted explanation but the bottom line is that the inner curtain would not close against the wall so it was difficult to keep the water from splashing out of the shower. The bottom line: these are problems that we might be tempted to tolerate at a cheap motel but, perhaps, not even then. Inn at the Market should pay more attention to such details before I can give an unqualified endorsement to an otherwise excellent hotel.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Angeles, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Everything\u201d", "Author": "HaveFunAndStayHealty", "ReviewID": "UR122201692", "Content": "When my wife and I want to treat ourselves to a great time by ourselves, Inn at the Market is on the top of our list.

Everyone was exceedingly friendly and any service you could hope for was immediately undertaken. Through their use of earpiece communication they could make sure that information was relayed almost the instant you request it. Being in the high end hospitality industry myself, this is the level of service I expect to see when going to other high end establishments. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and pleasant when bypassing in the hall, not scampering away or hiding behind service trucks. We dined at both Marche and Bacco, their on-site restaurants. Both were very good if not excellent. Bottom line, if you want great service with a clean room and excellent location, this is your hotel.

I did the valet parking (work was paying, so why not?) which wasn't much more than the nearby lots and very convenient - so even if I was paying for it I would have done it.

When you first walk in, the lobby is very warm and inviting. Any and all questions I had were answered by the people working the desk and they were extremely helpful. I had a light lunch at (what I think was called) the Pear Deli around the corner. It was just a cute little deli with a couple of little tables and my sandwich was awesome. For dinner that night I went over to the restaurant across the street (whose name escapes me - but the guy at the front desk recommended) and it was amazing. I took a nice long walk all through the market and then up towards the center of town where there were lots of cool shops and cool people. After having a great meal and a nice stroll I came back to my room to see that my bed had been turned down, complete with chocolates (not on the pillow, but on the desk next to the bed lol) I had to do some work (Which is why I was there in the first place - Boo!) but when I was finally able to go to bed, the bed couldn't have been more comfortable. Slept great, got out on time to go to my meeting and then was off to the airport.

This suite was very, very roomy! The main floor was the living room and small kitchenette with tv. The upstairs was the bedroom and bathroom with another tv. The view was amazing!! It was very clean and very comfortable. My only slightly negative comments would be lack of lighting in the bedroom. Since it was so large, the few lamps at either end of the room did not provide enough light for the middle of the room where the closet was. Also when I stay in luxury hotels, I do expect the bathroom to be way above standard - this one was large, but not with much useful space. There were no drawers/shelves to put toiletries. Also the water pressure was so low. Although there was a nice size tub, it would have taken forever to use it. Plus the shower head had little pressure and was not adjustable so rinsing my long hair took a good amount of time. For the last part of our stay we stayed in a smaller room with a city view. It was really nice - clean comfortable and very well lit. Also the bathroom had shelving to put toiletries and the shower head was adjustable so it felt like more water pressure due to its setting. The hotel overall was magnificent - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customer service was everything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings. Also it location was great.

My wife and I enjoyed breakfast and a latte at Cafe Campagne, just below the hotel, several mornings during our trip. The room I had was quite spacious.

I am a very light sleeper and the hotel did an excellent job of honoring my request for a quiet room away from elevators etc. It is amazing how many hotels fail in what should be essential: the \" good night sleep\" department. But even though the hotel is virtually in Pike's place market, it was quiet and relaxing. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but found them to be efficient and pleasant.

The only downside to being in this crowded vicinity was that the site of the hotel was on a very small lot sandwiched between stores and other apartment buildings. It just felt a little too claustrophobic. The compensation for this dilemma is the wonderful common balcony area on the second floor which overlooked Pike's Place Market partially and afforded a full view of Seattle Harbor. On the flipside, because of the location, it was very convenient to grab meals anytime of the day because of the various delis and restaurants in the area. Also, it was walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters and not to mention, the original Starbucks just down the hill. Be wary, though, of the many panhandlers and homeless when walking about. If you have a car, there is no self parking unless, you can find a public parking garage somewhere close by, otherwise the hotel has valet service and there is a parking charge of about $30.00 per night. Despite the fact that the location is in a busy neighborhood, the noise factor was remarkably not an issue, especially since we were on the second floor overlooking the street and stores. We had a room with double beds and ample room for a family with 2 active boys. It was clean and neat, but nothing spectacular. I thought the staff were cordial enough and helpful, but not overly helpful. The place exuded a very low key ambiance. Maybe it was the dim lighting or the fire place in the lobby that contributed to the effect. Overall, the room was decent, the hotel was small, the location was adequate, the atmosphere was sublime and the staff were professional.

I did not expect any rooms to be ready (10 am), but wanted to check our bags. One of our 3 rooms (2 Queen beds) was ready, so we had all of our bags sent to this room so we could freshen up. Our 2 Queen room was much larger than I had expected and was also able to fit a rollaway bed, which they happily provided. This alone made our stay better since our boys would be less likely to fight over pillows, the spot next to the table, etc. Our window faced a side street but had a beautiful view of the water to the left. There was a table and 2 chairs in front of the window where I liked to sit with my laptop and look out over the water. We had a fridge/ minibar, microwave, and large closet with many shelves. The bathroom was beautiful, clean and huge. I liked the bath products very much. The hairdryer left a lot to be desired for my long hair. I have yet to find a decent one in a hotel, so I always bring my own. We dropped our bags and went off to checkout the rest of the hotel and Public Market. I have to say that even if the hotel hadn't been as nice as it was, I still would have paid what I did (250 King city view and 320 2 Queen ) for the rooftop deck and proximity to Public Market. The deck is large with several tables with chairs, a few lounge chairs and an outdoor living room set. It looks directly over the market and the water. I went up every morning with my coffee and whatever treat I picked up at the Market. We also spent each evening up there reviewing our day's adventures over a bottle of wine. It was perfect. The location of the hotel cannot be beat if you truly want to be in the heart of it all. It is actually a part of the Market, so you walk out the door of the hotel, through its little courtyard (which I love) and you are there. It was wonderful to be able to wander at my leisure during the off hours than suffer the rat race that the Market can become in the middle of the day. If you haven't been to Seattle, it is filled with steep hills. Even though we were in a great location, my husband's parents usually called a cab to go anywhere beyond the Market. The rest of us easily walked to our destintation or to the bus tunnel or monorail. We did walk to Safeco Field as well (about a mile), but opted to take a cab back since going back was all uphill and we were tired. The hotel staff, as expected, were very helpful with checkout. The loaned us a scale for our luggage (airline fees :( ) They also helped us to arrange a van to the airport.

It's got soul, plus all of the tick-boxes: enormous comfy bed, spacious bathroom, nice robes, warm cosy lobby with fire, great staff, excellent food in the restaurants (we had breakfast at Bacco both mornings - truly great coffee, I'm Australian so I know about these things). It's also got free wifi, which is so nice after being rorted by countless big hotels for use of their network, and a beautiful deck from which you can admire the Puget Sound. The only criticism I would make is that the air conditioning in the room was quite loud and would go on and off intermittently throughout the day and night. Not a problem for me as I wear earplugs anyway (conditioned by years of city living) but it has the potential to be an issue if you are a sensitive sleeper. All in all I would recommend Inn at the Market to anyone: couples, business travellers, families. It's great.

We came a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We picked the Inn at the Market from pictures and reviews on the internet, as well as its close proximity to the Pike Place Market. We were very impressed with our first impression of the Inn at the Market. The great view of the main entrance of the Pike Place Market, the attractive garden courtyard, and the sleek style of the front lobby. Landon met us at our cab and took custody of all of our bags. We met Noelle at the front counter. Although we were early for our check in time, she took our cell phone number to let us know when our room was ready. We were both incredibly impressed with her extremely friendly attitude and helpful manner. You could tell that she was just a genuinely nice person, and that she wasn't just being polite because it was an obligation for her position. Landon was very professional as well, introduced himself further at the check in desk, and arranged for our bags to be stored so we could begin to see Seattle. When we returned a little while later, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a two story townhouse suite. The room was lovely, and had a stunning city view of the corner of Pine and 1st St. (great for people watching!!). I don't recall the name of the bellhop who brought our luggage to our room, but he was extremely polite and helpful as well. He filled our ice bucket before leaving. We were actually SAD that we had to leave the next day to go on our cruise!! Both Seattle and the Inn at the Market greatly exceeded our expectations. We hope to return soon, and will plan to stay at the Inn at the Market again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seattle. It is located right at the entrance to Pike Place Market. The market is interesting, a wonderful place to pick up some handmade souvenirs by local artists, and a terrific place to try different ethnic foods. Within walking distance - The first Starbucks, The Seattle Aquarium, The Westlake Center Mall, a major bus / train stop (at the mall), Piroshky Piroshky (Russian pastries at the market), Pike Place Chowder (at the market), Le Panier (French pastries at the market). A helpful hint: You can take the train to and from Sea-Tac Airport for $2.50 a person one way. Much cheaper than the $45 fare from the airport or the $35 fare to the airport. It is really easy to use too... just go to the bottom floor of the mall. You can also catch the monorail from the top floor of the mall... we did not take this, but you can go to the Space Needle using this (cheaper than a taxi also). .", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest Place to stay in Seattle!\u201d", "Author": "Tommy-Tbone", "ReviewID": "UR78059490", "Content": "The Inn at the Market was in a fantastic location right at the \"Market\".

The hotel room, rooftop deck, lobby, and courtyard (shared with Campagne and other shops) are all gorgeous. The beds are so comfortable, as are the robes, and everything you can imagine needing during your stay is most likely already provided for you in the room. Love the roomy and elegant bathrooms, too, with lush towels and toiletries. What I was REALLY impressed with was the staff. Working in customer service my whole life gives me a unique perspective, and I have to say this is the most welcoming and professional hotel staff I have ever encountered. A+++for all of them. The rooftop deck on the 5th floor is a very special treat where you can bring your coffee, wine, book, laptop or just sit and enjoy the view of the sound. If you need a gym, you can get a day pass at Seattle Athletic Club for $15(pretty swank gym) right around the corner. We also ate brunch at Cafe Campagne right around the corner, which I SOOOO recommend (make reservations!). Oh yeah--and when I made the reservations, I mentioned it was my husband's birthday. When we checked in, there was a birthday card with 4 mini-cupcakes waiting for him. Very nice and sweet touch. We will definitely be telling all of our friends about this place (as well as out-of-town guests at the restaurant we work at), and we will definitely be back to visit ourselves!

The best part of the hotel is the (almost) rooftop terrace that looks out across the sound. On a nice day it was wonderful to have an escape with a wonderful view. My complaints of the hotel are few, but in general I would say that the basic rooms are overpriced for what you receive. I would recommend paying just a bit extra to get a room on the courtyard or have a sound view, because the street that we had a view of was less than desirable. Also, I'm glad that we got to try a Tempurpedic bed before purchasing one, because neither of us was a big fan. One other thing that would be a very cool touch in my opinion would be to have a hot tub up on the terrace. Just a suggestion of course.

The room was beautiful with nice linens and an amazing view. Being an original building to downtown and the Market, you might think it outdated but not so. They have kept the charm but updated the furniture and finishings in high class. The rooftop patio is something not to be missed. Even though we were there in the winter, we took our hot drinks and wore our complementary robes up to the rooftop to watch the ferries drift across the water all lit up. People watching and hearing the sounds of the city at night were so fun. When the chill got to us we continued the fun in our room with the floor to ceiling windows that opened to the railing and city below. The night we wanted to go to dinner the Inn's towncar and driver happily drove us and came back to pick us up, free of charge! Gratuities are welcomed and please tip well as these kids are so kind and work very hard to be gracious. Overall this was a perfect stay, within the same block as the Market and the Original Starbucks And a French bakery that is soooo yummy.

The day of my reservation, December 1st, turned out to be a beautiful Seattle winter day. There was hardly a cloud in the sky as I pulled up to the valet stand for the Inn, several hours early for my check-in time. I was planning to have lunch nearby with my mother before checking in and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to bother with finding street parking before I could have my car parked in the hotel lot. John, the valet, was happy to take my car for me. The front desk was incredibly accommodating as well, allowing me to check in early and letting me upgrade into a better room. Since I had never stayed in the hotel before, I had no real idea what to expect, aside from some of the pleasant looking pictures on their website. I received my room key and headed upstairs. (As a note, there was always an elevator open and waiting for me every time I entered the lobby!) I opened the door to a nice, spacious room. It was clean and bright and brightly lit by the afternoon sunlight despite all the curtains being drawn. I was in a bit of a hurry to meet my mother for lunch down the street, so I set my belongings down and went to head out the door. Before I left, I thought to myself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really leave without taking a glance at the view, can I?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I walked back across the room to pull the curtains aside and involuntarily gasped. The view was stunning and was coupled with a private patio that was almost as large as the room itself! Now, those who know me are familiar with my great love for Seattle and both its natural and man-made beauty. To be on that patio, standing over Elliott Bay with the embracing cityscape of the Emerald city surrounding me, was invigorating. After a moment of appreciation, I turned back into the room and noticed out of the corner of my eye four delicate cupcakes and hand-written card acknowledging my special occasion. An excellent touch. After lunch, some friends joined me in the room for some sparkling wine and conversation for a couple hours before dinner (dining out is my favorite way to celebrate). The hotel was quick to provide some extra glasses for our festivities and brought them up nearly in the time it took to open the bottle! The night was wonderful. It was so pleasant to wake up in their luxurious bed to another clear winter day beaming in through the windows and through the patio doors. A couple very relaxing hours of lazing around and I called down to the front desk to alert them that I would soon be ready for my car (as they had asked). After returning my keys I walked out the lobby of the hotel to see my car already waiting for me. Soon after returning home I realized that I had misplaced couple items. When I came back to the restaurant the next day I stopped by to inquire with the front desk if I had left them there. Sure enough, they had them set aside to return to me.

The hotel is in a small quaint building that doesn't look like the other high rise hotels in Downtown Seattle. It has Tempur Pedics beds and the real kicker is the 5th floor rooftop terrace that overlooks the market and the Puget Sound. The desk staff was nice enough to give me a great room with a partial water view (even though I paid for the inexpensive city view). Each night I would take a bottle of wine and cheese and sit on the terrace and watch the ferries roll in on the Puget Sound. This hotel is what MADE my stay in Seattle so great - that and the Lady Gaga concert at the Showbox! The desk staff at the hotel were so friendly and I really felt at home while staying there. I had never been to Seattle and was alone for a week long trip- the staff did everything possible to ensure I had a wonderful trip.

We booked our room via an Alaska Airlines Vacation Package. The package deal provided a free night (equating to a nearly $300 savings). The key elements of this hotel are the location and staff. The rooms are fine (not remarkable) but they are plenty clean and comfortable. We highly recommend staying here via a package deal to save some money. LOCATION: The hotel's location is tough to beat. It is literally right across the street from Pike Place Market and the original Starbucks. It is within a short walk to key Seattle downtown sites (Space Needle, Pioneer Square) and in our case we didn't have a car. Valet parking at the hotel runs about $30 a day. ROOMS: Our room had a partial view of the water (which really added a lot to the experience and reduced noise compared to the city-only view rooms). They were pretty new and felt clean but did not exude luxury. The bed utilized a foam-based mattress (but was comfortable) and the sitting area was small but nice. Overall the room was the least memorable aspect of the stay but clearly not a reason to not book at this hotel. SERVICES: This hotel has an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. From the moment we arrived (they set us up with an early check-in), to great food suggestions and a kind valet service we felt like service was king here. They provide a free choice of newspapers delivered to your room (Seattle Times, NY Times or WSJ), the hotel has a free shoe-shine service and they provided taxis and other needs without hesitation. The restaurant (which is connected but not affiliated) was good for breakfast but a bit expensive - it ran $40/couple. If you are willing to walk a little there are bagel shops and other food opportunities at reduced rates in the area. The wireless Internet was reliable and fast/free. OVERALL: Overall we would stay here again. We found rates to be a bit high through their website but would attempt to stay via a package deal. We would highly suggest attempting to obtain a view room (water view) and possibly eating at non-affiliated restaurants to save money.

The location makes it so easy to walk over to the Market for breakfast in the morning and is really a great home base for all your touring. Our room was fantastic.

We had covered the whole downtown area pretty well by our last day and wanted to venture into one of the surrounding neighborhoods (Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, etc.) The man at the front desk had no suggestions on where to go and gave us wrong directions to Capitol Hill, which was a bummer way to end our trip.

The people there were very knowlegeable about places to go, where to eat, and just about anything you asked. I will stay there again when we do visit again.

Terrible, Terrible Service\u201d", "Author": "HockeyGDS", "ReviewID": "UR35998449", "Content": "For our anniversary and my first trip to Seattle, my husband chose the Inn at the Market for our stay due to the high reviews, its location and the services they provide. Although Expedia booked us for a city view room, my husband sent a message to the hotel and told them he was willing to pay for an upgrade to a water view room. We never received a response from the hotel despite that fact that he sent the request for an upgrade two and a half months in advance. Finally my husband contacted them a couple of weeks before our trip and they informed us that they had just booked every room. The town car service is a joke. The first time we used it, the driver (who is also the bell hop) didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the museum was, despite the fact that we had the address and its major cross streets. After driving around the block once, he told us that he needed to get back to the hotel and that maybe we would have better luck finding it on foot. So he dropped us off in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ghetto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (he literally dropped us off at the door of a homeless shelter with people loitering, smoking marijuana and talking to themselves). We had no idea where we were or where we needed to be going and we totally stood out. Luckily someone was able to point us in the right direction. The driver had dropped us off about four blocks away from where we asked to go. Had I been that driver I would have at least called the hotel and asked if they could have provided me with directions, not dropped the tourist off in a highly questionable neighborhood telling them that typically the bums don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause people trouble during the day as a reassurance! Our second experience with the town car was even worse. We had a dinner reservation at the Space Needle for our anniversary and when we inquired about using the town car, we were told that due to the Sea Fair Torch parade and traffic being difficult to navigate that they couldn't be bothered with the town car. (As tourist, one of the times you need a courtesy car the most is when traffic and typical routes are difficult to navigate due to a special event!) At this point we asked what they recommended we do and they suggested a cab or the monorail. We thought maybe the hotel company had a specific cab company they used, but no, they just hail whatever cab happens to be driving by and because the streets were closing down for the parade not a lot of cabs were going by. We ended up taking the monorail which is about five or six blocks away from the hotel. On our walk back to the hotel after dinner we had the pleasure of walking by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suspected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gang shooting as it took place (two blocks away from the hotel). We were walking when we heard seven gunshots and suddenly we were surrounded by suspected gang members and police officers with guns and TAZERS drawn. Checking the Seattle Times, we were relieved to learn that only one person was wounded and no one had died, but it obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the end to our anniversary night that we had hoped for. With the amount of money we were paying for the room (not to mention the $25 a day to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153valet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the car), I really expected superior service. The view was the best part and it was only \"nice\", it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth all the money we were paying. Either they have really poor customer service standards or they treated us poorly because we booked through Expedia, either way I will not recommend that hotel to anyone. It just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the money in the long run.

We inquired if a larger room might be available, and were told that all rooms were the same size. Therefore I'm confused as to other reviews which discuss \"huge\" rooms. Location is wonderful, but room and staff were not at all as impressive. As one other reviewer mentioned awhile back, the water pressure in shower is awful, the tub is tiny so that a shower always involved the curtain sticking to me, our sink drained so slowly it was rather unpleasant to look at! Also, the air conditioner is very noisy when it goes on/off during the night, often waking us up. The queen bed was comfortable, but awfully squeaky. I'm not usually one to complain, but I feel that I had to add this review to counter all the wonderful ones I read before booking this hotel. Staff was nice enough, but not at all helpful - in fact, the only restaurant that was ever recommended to us was Cutters down the street - we wondered if they were getting paid to do this! (Cutters is ok, but nothing to rave about). When I asked for another casual restaurant for salads/sandwiches, one young man at the desk even said there weren't restaurants like that in Seattle.... something I find hard to believe.

Keep in mind if driving that parking is available only through valet service ($25), but I believe that is less expensive than any available overnight parking nearby. The fifth floor deck is beautiful! It was a little cool while we were there, but we still went to the deck to enjoy the fabulous views of the sunset. You can also see Safeco Field in the distance, where that night the Mariners lost to the Rays. We asked for suggestions on where to go for good seafood and two people recommended Cutters where my husband and I both had roasted dungeness crab. It's about a 3-4 block walk from the hotel. Very nice restaurant with a great view. The hotel also offers a nice business center with computers, printer and fax machine. One downfall might be the heater/air conditioner. It was a little noisy and we ended up turning it completely off during the night. Traffic noise was heavy at night also. The first couple nights of our stay in Seattle, we stayed in a vacation rental by owner whch gave us a whole different perspective of the city, but if I were to return to Seattle and stay in a hotel again, it would be the Inn at the Market.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, OH", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "CurlERed", "ReviewID": "UR27599233", "Content": "I could go on & on about this hotel but I'll try to keep it brief! My husband & I booked the Inn for our honeymoon based on the great reviews that we had seen on this site. We were also impressed by the fact that the GM, Mr. Watkins, responds to the reviews. I emailed him and requested that he arrange \"something special\" for us upon our arrival. We were absolutely thrilled to arrive and find a bottle of Tattinger champagne and the most heavenly chocolate cake I've ever tasted, waiting on us in our room. The hand written congratulations card was a very nice touch. I think that we were also upgraded based on the fact that we had paid for a room with a city view but our room had a partial water view along with the city view. In my mind, its the little things that make this place special. The attention to detail by the housekeeping staff was outstanding. Noticing that my husband had doubled his pillow up for added support, we came back to our room the next night to find an extra set of pillows on our bed. That's just one example. Another night, we had dinner reservations and asked for a cab. When we came downstairs, the ladies at the desk offered us the town car instead! We loved the Seattle Chocolates on our bed each night and the free wireless internet was a very nice touch. We ordered room service from Campagne and it was absolutely fabulous. I honestly could go on and on about our trip, it was absolutely amazing. If I had to levy one complaint, it would be that the TV channels were pretty dismal. I only noticed this because as honeymooners, we were in our room more than we would've been on a normal trip! 4 government access channels, no music, no HBO, etc. The reception was also grainy most of the time. Again, not something that most people would really care about..we are never on a trip to watch TV but again, this is just me trying to come up with something that wasn't entirely positive. Thank you, thank you so much to the Inn at the Market for helping us have an absolutely amazing honeymoon! I have already recommended the hotel to a friend who will be going to Seattle and I can honestly say that I will never stay anywhere else when I come back to Seattle.

(you can see multiple reviews of it online) And I mean hard, not firm. If you like any softness with your bed you will not be comfortable. Personally I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised a hotel would go for such a specialty mattress in every room because this is clearly a mattress that is designed more for a specific group of people with back problems, etc. then the general public. Basically it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the type of mattress you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll either love or hate with no in-between. There were super hard pillows the 1st night too, but the 2nd night regular pillows appeared after the room was cleaned, which was nice. And the bed linen/comforter itself was very nice and warm. This a tiny hotel so unable to do laundry on certain days which was inconvenient for us(unable to do on Saturday after 9am or Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) View from 3rd floor was a view of a wall 5 feet away. But if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to spend a lot of time in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (otherwise try to get a room on at least 4th floor) Some rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have bathtubs and they should tell you before assigning that room to you. Between entering the hotel and getting to room had to tip 3 different people. (but they were very nice) Sink in bathroom was extremely dirty at check-in; it cleaned easily so not sure why it was so filthy; tiny shower head; and bathtub space is tiny (again, not sure why since the hotel room itself was quite large and there bathroom area is actually a decent size) Taking a shower is an exercise in fighting off the shower curtain and not falling out of the tub. And I'm not a big person but it was like the size of the tub was tiny for some reason. Lighting in room is too dark for reading (bathroom had decent light) No on-site gym; have to pay $15/day to use city gym a few blocks away Limited TV. channels (I could be spoiled though since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m use to hotels having flat screens and lots of HD channels/movie channels); they had the basics\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6CNN, ESPN, and local I find it annoying when housekeeping calls to ask about servicing your room when you clearly have a do-not-disturb sign up. It little things that make a hotel 4 vs. 3 stars. Ie>Just invest in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we tried to service your room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs and slip it under the door. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the message without you annoying me every single day when I clearly asked not to be disturbed. ----------------------------------------------------- THE GOOD :-) Free internet (always a big plus!) and it was fast wireless. Spacious room and bedroom area was clean; lots of space in closet Provided decent robes; iron/board Overall staff was very friendly and helpful. Refrigerator in room was nice for storage of food from Pike Place (and you will end up with something with all the meats, cheeses, etc) Room service was fast and prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crazy. It's the restaurant menu but okay. Had minibar products in room; lots of snacks Bar service in Campagne was excellent with very friendly and professional bartenders Had room opening to cute courtyard but only heard loud noise once; much quieter than anticipated which was great. Doors should have chain/deadbolt on top since they open to outside though. (one turn lock didn't feel secure) 5th floor rooftop is a great place to get a view of the city day or night. I appreciated it was open 24/7 just to go up and view the city/water. Air/heat control in room was great You could throw a rock and hit Pike Place Market, fantastic location (which is their best feature) It's a cute little open style hotel and you don't dread going 'home' at the end of the day which is nice. ------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Overall this is not a 4 star hotel, but definitely a very nice solid 3 star and I would stay again due to location if the rate were under $200. (Even with the bed which I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like but could tolerate.) But to be honest, if I wanted true 4 or 5 star experience with the same great location, great service, gorgeous rooms, great staff, etc. I would stay at the new Four Seasons one block away again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still directly next to Pike Place Market but a much higher value for my money.

There are plenty of places to eat very close by, from quick snacks to nice restaurants, so again location was excellent. We had breakfast at a small French patiserie about 2 minutes away that served great coffee and fantastic pasteries at a reasonable price. We were also impressed with the hotel. Although it doesnt look much from the outside, its been decorated modern but refined and the room was great. We tend to try and get a room with a view and in this case stayed in a Parlour Suite. While expensive, the room didnt let us down with both the view and quality. We were very happy and comfortable.

In the bag was my wedding ring, my diamond engagement ring, a diamond pendant, pearls, among others....precious pieces that I have had for our 32 years of marriage. I immediately called the hotel to report my loss. The maid had registered my jewelry bag, sealed it, and sent it to the front desk. It was there when I called.

We spent two nights at the Inn at the Market before a cruise to Alaska and one night upon our return.

The other morning we had pastry and coffee in a french pastry shop just down the street. We picked up great fruit to snack on in our room. We ate at Etta's one night and had delicious fresh oysters, halibut and fabulous coconut creme pie for dessert. One night we selected a variety of cheeses, crab, bread, olives, berries, peaches and things from various shops in the market. We bought some wine from Cost Plus, just down the street and had a little picnic up on the 5th floor deck. It was great! Gosh, we just had a great time and the situation of the hotel made it perfect for a nap before dinner and stopping back in to drop off packages.

The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came.

I booked this hotel directly and immediately had the feeling I would be happy there. The girl on the other end of the line could not have been more friendly or willing to please. When we arrived we were quickly taken up to our room and famiiarized with what the room had to offer. We had booked a two story suite which was perfect for my husband, myself and daughter. We all had our privacy and my daughter had a separate tv and pull out couch that was made up immediately on request. We all had the same great view of the water and the public market. The hotel has a lovely patio that overlooks the water. It is raised so provides a wonderful view. My daughter and I went out there after dinner and had a wonderful relaxing chat about our day before going upstairs to bed. The only negative would be that there is only one bathroom and it is upstairs (and the stairs would not be good for someone handicapped although my husband struggles with walking because of car accident and he had no complaints) so if you aren't a good sharer and you are traveling with more then your spouse/friend take this into consideration. We had friends come in from Vancouver the last night of our stay and the hotel was very good about finding us last minute reservations for five to accomodate their arrival time. I will say that we were very lucky weatherwise and that on foggy, drizzly or rainy days that our impressions might not have been quite so good but that would not be the hotel's fault.

The hotel allocated adjoining (though not connected) handicapped-accessible rooms on the third floor (301 + 302). A door separates these two rooms from the rest of the floor, which features a conference room or two, resulting in a very quiet stay. Because of the extremely steep slope of Pine Street down to the Pike Place Market, these rooms, reached by a lift from the lobby, are on the street level of First Avenue. It is possible to request a key to this street level door, allowing disabled guests to return directly to their room (and the elevators) without negotiating the slope to the main lobby. A bus stop outside the door unfortunately precludes bringing a car right to the door, but a parking lot on level ground is just a block away, and might suit for setting down or picking up a wheelchair-using passenger. Both rooms were very attractively furnished (see photo) and both had windows opening onto the little alley separating the hotel from Campagne Restaurant (which provides the dinner room service). 301 also has an oversized, bumped-out window-seat overlooking Pine St and the market. Great for early morning people watching. Access was acceptable in both bathrooms. A steel shelving unit holding towels and bath amenities was convenient but it made 301's bathroom a tighter fit than necessary; the toilet height, position in the room, and placement of grab bars were problematic. Pluses included the wall-hung sink and curbless shower stall that included a seat with a back. An additional accessibility caveat: the hotel's main entrance and valet car parking service is on Pine. The slope is steep, a potential hazard for a disabled driver exiting from the driver's side of the vehicle. Exit from the passenger side, and nose the car into the curb (which is, incidentally, 5\" high) to offer the greatest protection from traffic and the incline.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "cthenn", "ReviewID": "UR12293576", "Content": "Wow! What a great hotel! Good job TripAdvisor reviewers...I chose this hotel based on the ranking and reviews, and I'm very glad I did. This is definitely a \"boutique\" hotel, but the price was very reasonable. Yes, it was a winter rate, but I would have no problem going back in the high season. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's right above the Pike Place Market (not literally) and in the heart of downtown. Each morning, we could step outside, and get breakfast from a multitude of local eateries, and then stroll through the market to pick up grapefruit-size apples. It's also a few blocks from the Westlake center and a little further to the Space needle. And it's just a stones throw from the Seattle waterfront. The room itself is rather spacious, and the Tempur Pedic bed was really nice. I wasn't used to it, and slept only ok on it, but at least they went the extra mile to put those high end mattresses in the rooms. The bathroom was also very nice, and very clean. There is a stocked honor bar and mini-fridge (which I used to store my own drinks and cold items), as well as a room safe. The view from the room was awesome. We were supposed to have a \"city view\" but I got a partial water view from my room. (Tip: I told them I wanted to be away from the elevators, which I do recommend, and they gave me a better room since the elevators are by the city view rooms) We spent a good amount of time just relaxing by the large bay window people watching and gazing out over the sound and the Olympic mountains in the distance. The only complaint I would have is the TV reception was not very good, and the number of stations was very limited. We didn't even get the weather channel, and this is Seattle in winter!!! But, who spends their vacation watching TV in the hotel? Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. Its location cannot be beat, and the boutique feel to it was very nice. The rooms are very spacious, clean, and comfortable. It was very quiet at night (Seattle is very quiet at night!) also. The 5th floor \"rooftop garden\" was a great place to hang out, albeit cold in winter! It also overlooks the Sound, with nice vistas in all directions. You can even see Mt. Ranier from the garden.

It was wonderful to be right in the heart of things in Seattle, too. I enjoyed walking around the fish market, stopping at the original Starbucks for tea in the mornings, and eating at nearby restaurant The Pink Door. The one disappointment for me was the lack of breakfast, not a huge deal since there is a restaurant attached to the inn where you can order breakfast (though it is sit-down, not quick take-out) and many other restaurants nearby, but a slight inconvenience. As long as you're prepared for that, and leave time to find breakfast elsewhere, this won't be an issue. The rooftop deck offered a lovely view of the Puget Sound.

Our room was a standard one, with a somewhat disappointing view of the wall of the building across the courtyard, on the 3rd floor. Not a big deal, since we could go up to the rooftop terrace if we wanted a great view. I will say the best thing about the Inn was the location. Pike Place Market is a great place to leisurely explore, and it's right there. My husband walked down across the street every morning to get fresh hot croissants and coffee for breakfast, and we visited the bakeries many times for late night snacks. My biggest complaint was the Tempurpedic mattress. Everyone else in these reviews rave about them, but my back hated it! I have chronic low back pain anyway (and was 6 months pregnant when we went), and was really looking forward to some great sleep, but wound up hurting terribly. In fact, I wound up having to sleep sitting up in bed because laying down was so painful. On our 3rd day there I asked the person at the front desk if I could get a cot in my room because the bed was really uncomfortable to me and they told me it was against fire code. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but it sure wasn't what I wanted to hear. They didn't seem to care too much that a pregnant patron wasn't able to sleep at all on their beds. Smaller complaints: my husband and I stopped at the front desk to ask directions from Discovery Park over to the zoo, two of the places we were planning on visiting. The girl handed us a Budget rental car map and circled each place on there for us. She didn't try to help us out with the best route to take from one to the next, even though we asked, just pointed out each place again as if to brush us off. Obviously we can read a map and did find our way, but I was once again disappointed in the service. Also, the room was very noisy due to all the street noise, especially in the morning as trucks unloaded their stuff for the day at the market. It didn't bother us too badly, because we sleep with a white noise machine which helps to mask it. I can't imagine the racket we would have had to listen to without it. So be aware of that potential problem. Overall, our experience was still pleasant, though, mostly due to the location of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large and nicely stocked, and the terrace view was really amazing. However, we can't go back because of the beds which is a shame.

This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues: 1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center.

The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells.

The most wonderful feature of this boutique hotel is its location which is literally at the Pikes Pier market. It was wonderful to be able to simply step out of our hotel and walk through the market. From our hotel window we watched as the flower booths were setup, we watched cruise ships, ferries, and the bustle of the market activity. Wonderful. When we arrived we found that our room had only 1 queen bed and we expressed that we would prefer 2 queen beds. They made every effort to accommodate this request and we were given a room with a pullout sofa -- it suited us very well. The room was not large but it was very clean and well furnished and suited our needs. We also enjoyed the deck on the 5th floor which is nicely furnished with deck furniture and affords a great view of the water and the market. 4th of July firewords viewed from the deck are spectacular. We also found the staff to be very friendly and competent. All of the desk personnel are concierges. They booked several reservations and cruises for us. The only area which I felt could possibly be improved was the room service menu. The room service is provided by a restaurant which shares the courtyard called Campagne. We found the menu to be too limited and the items too obscure to be appealling. However it was of little matter since the area that the hotel is situated is surrounded by a large number of restaurants and eateries.

The lobby is modest but comfortable - you'll note that there are no pictures of the lobby on the website, because it's not much of a selling point. The courtyard, however, was quaint and quite pleasant. The fountain is relaxing, and the brick facade with the hanging ivy is a beautiful entry. I had a courtyard view room at the 4th floor, which has no view of Elliot Bay. I think you need to be at the 6th or higher for a bay view. The room was enormous and comfortable, and the bathroom is spacious. The ceilings were high, as expected of an older building. The bed was a king size Tempurpedic, as advertised. If you've never slept in a Tempurpedic, I must say that it is similar to an Asian hotel experience - the bed seems very hard at first, but gradually (slowly) forms to your shape, for a rested sleep - it just doesn't seem like it at first! The restaurant, Campagne, is an excellent (though smallish) French style restaurant, with a good wine selection, particularly the dessert wines (if there's any remaining, try the Cuvee Boytrytis-amazing!). Room service is offered from here, and I can only assume the experience will be as nice. There is a small coffee shop with morning bakery, and that was a delight first thing in the morning. The morning paper was at the door, and although the offerings included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I opted for the local paper. In-room wireless internet was complimentary, and signal strength in the room was fine. The location is simply wonderful, literally across the street from Post Alley and well-known pub Kell's, and (in my opinion) a better, local favorite White Horse Pub - DO stop in and give this gem a try! As you can see from the pictures, the Public Market is at your doorstep, and the rooftop terrace has a spectacular view (lacking in most of the rooms). I wish I had a full day to appreciate the rooftop deck, because it was delightful first thing in the morning (again, I refer to the pictures). The energy in the area is wonderful, and you are walking distance to much that Seattle offers.

We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables. Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market. The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates. We enjoyed our time here.

No matter when we came or went, we were always greeted with a smile and eye contact - I really love that.

At the time it seemed charming, luxurious, well-managed, and well-positioned to walk the downtown area. When we returned in June, 2006, we found the property in exactly the same state, down to the carpets and the paint job, only five years older. Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing. Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting. I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful. But they can't take the cigar smokers off their own balcony, nor the drunk, nocturnally screaming frat boys from the adjacent streets. I hear the Four Seasons is opening a new hotel in the Fall....", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Altos, California", "Title": "\u201cStylish, comfortable, great location\u201d", "Author": "LoveWineAndGardens", "ReviewID": "UR5316258", "Content": "It was great to stay so close to the market, with all the shops, restaurants, and food purveyors in easy walking distance. The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter. The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish \"tah-pahs\" rather than \"taa-paas\"). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said \"topless\"). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away? These are minor glitches, but for $300+ a night, you expect a hotel to work these sorts of kinks out of the system.

There is excellent shopping nearby. I recommend Inn at the Market unreservedly for those on vacation in Seattle. The staff is friendly, the room is comfortable and restful, and the location cannot be improved upon. One small quibble: no lobby shop for sundries, and unfortunately the hotel is some distance from a drugstore. If you are a business traveler (as I was), I might send you elsewhere (perhaps to the Vintage Park, the Monaco, or the Olympic Four Seasons) for the following reasons: (1)No desk with task lighting. Although there was a windowed table in my room, it did not have task lighting nearby. I had to order a flashlight to read paperwork while working on my computer at night. (2)Staff will not put Fed Ex charges on your room account. Yes, they will (after some idiscussion) charge your credit card for Fed Ex, but it would be easier to just have the charge added to your room, as most business-oriented hotels will do.

On the first floor, the residents tend to 'hang out' on the sidewalks with their front doors open facing the parking lot (and some of them have very stinky condos due to pet odors). Not a good impression walking to the lobby area. The front desk is nice enough and tried to be accomodating to my requests, but I just don't think I should have to go down there every day to ask for towels, bed sheets, etc, if I 'follow the rules' and put my sign out on the door every day. The particular unit we were in had a horrible leak overhead in the bathroom, the patio door could not be locked, terribly uncomfortable mattresses and sleeper sofa (old and flat), the refrigerator wouldn't get cold enough during the 4 days we were there, and the floors were absolutely filthy, even after I complained and they mopped--still gross. Room was incredibly humid, so I kept having to run the a/c even though it made it too cold at times (dehumidifier in the room didn't work). This is also one of those places that expects you to wash the dishes otherwise you will be charged something like $25 for leaving them, and that also means they are 'exempt' from sanitizing the kitchen. Yuck!!! I would have checked out early and gone elsewhere, but they collect all your money up front, so I would've been SOL for leaving early ($100+/night). Only stayed here at the request of friends who have been coming for the last 3 years, so I trusted their judgment--in years past, they had gotten decent service and a different room, but I know this year, they also had to go get their own towels, etc, and were disappointed with their room selection. I've stayed in 2/2 condos for less money and better housekeeping. The only things that were nice about this stay was having an oceanfront balcony on the car-free section of the beach, and the pool was kept up (surprisingly). Sorry to sound negative, but I am stating the facts.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "Michelle2020", "ReviewID": "UR138453960", "Content": "My husband , I & our dog just stayed here for 9 days, the staff was extremely helpful in making our stay the best, Misty went out of her way to help with the kind of room I asked for(king room with ocean front balcony) & all the staff right down to maids & maintence people were very friendly.

By the time the third maintenance man came to work on it - and we were told the pipes were so old and they had roots growing in them - I went to the front desk to see what Plan B would be. Plan B was to move us to another room. But then it turned out that room wasn't actually available because some other guests had been moved into that room because the beds in their room were too small, but the change hadn't been put in the computer yet. We went and looked at the room and it was fine. We went to grab a bite to eat and as we were walking across the parking lot, we saw people going into our room. Yes, the room change had not been put into the computer yet so they had sent people up to look at the room to see if it was acceptable to them. The sink in the bathroom did not drain. When the maintenance man came up to look at it, he called me into the bathroom. He told me and showed me that the stopper was too large and we just needed to take it out for the water to drain. Silly world, thinking sinks NEEDED stoppers. We were discussing the beds and I mentioned mine was nice and firm. My friend said something about hers having a slant. When I woke up the first morning, I looked across the room and since the bedspread was no longer just hanging down, I could see the source of the slant. The bed frame was broken on one corner and an ice bucket had been placed underneath the bed to 'fix' it. Except that the ice bucket had shifted and was no longer holding the bed up. The maintenance man gave us a long explanation about how a new frame would need to be ordered, and they didn't know things were broken until someone called about it, that they didn't actually own the room, etc, etc. Whatever!!", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cAged, Typical Worn out Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Adam S", "ReviewID": "UR135480421", "Content": "This is a typical older Beach front hotel.

The room was furnished amazingly and completely spotless. Instead of an ugly little bathtub, the room had a great open custom shower. The bathroom amenities were very nice also. The room had a designer king sized bed with one of the most comfortable mattresses I have ever slept on. There was this massive Hi-Def TV hanging on the wall (must have been at least 46\"), and every other appointment one could ever ask for including a kitchenette area with a nice small refrigerator, really nice microwave, sink, granite counters, dishes, glasses and utensils. And I haven't even got to the best part. The VIEW! It was incredible. Direct ocean view overlooking the pool and beach. The ocean was practically close enough to touch it from our beautiful balcony. Nothing but beach and ocean as far as the eyes could see. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and I don't have a bad thing to say about it.

This is an overall nice property, very nice staff and very accommodating to motorcyclists! However, there is a caveat. Each room is owned individually. The property is essentially Condo's and each owner handles their room or suite themselves in regards to remodeling, etc. We booked a suite because we needed some extra space. I can only speak of this particular room because unlike a chain hotel with cookie-cutter rooms, each of these will be renovated differently. I can say this one is in serious need of an update. It was overall, clean, cool and had a nice view. But the bathroom bordered on terrible. Tile in the tub/shower had dirty grout; faucets worn and ready to fall off. Bathroom door knob coming off the door; and the tub was extremely slippery. There is no mat either. The TV's are old, remote didn't work on the bedroom TV. The windows throughout this room were likewise, terrible. Tried to open a couple and they nearly fell out. Cheap cabinets, ancient stove, uncomfortable vintage furniture. We glanced at a few other rooms which were being cleaned and the door was open and several others looked much nicer but weren't suites. Again, it's up to the owner to do this. Basically, I'd recommend this hotel because of the location and staff, plus there is a great bar/restaurant adjacent to the office (run by a different entity). The lobby of the hotel is nice, had soda and water machines, morning coffee, etc. What I'd recommend to anyone staying here is immediately, examine your room and if it's old, outdated and doesn't meet your standards, simply ask for another. The hotel has around 120 rooms, and rents about 90 of them; so chances are you'll get a better room than we did. But if not, just ask for something else. In summary, you'll really like the location and staff. They're great. But since each room is subject to what the owner puts into them, it may be hit-or-miss for a decent one. For what we paid, it should have been much nicer, but Suites are limited in numbers.

Condo-tel. All of the rooms are privately owned by individuals like you and me. But not all of the rooms belong to the rental program that is managed by the front desk. What this means is that you can rent some of the rooms out by dealing directly with the rooms' owner, and you can rent some of the rooms out by dealing with the front desk. When you rent your room from the front desk, you get all of the amenities you'd expect from a hotel: reprogrammable keys, toiletries, clean sheets, maid service, housecleaning, maintenance crew, etc. It's just like your traditional hotel service. On the other hand, if you rent your room directly from one of the owners, you don't get the amenities provided by the front desk. You get whatever the owner promised you (if anything) when you made your arrangement with the owner. Since most owners don't live onsite, there's a good chance you won't receive much in the way of personal service, compared to the dedicated onsite front desk staff that works for the rental program. So, for example, when you read a post here from someone saying that the front desk didn't help them out, it's most likely because the person rented a room directly from an owner who doesn't belong to the rental program. Owners on the rental program pay a fee to the front desk to take care of their rooms for them and provide all of the comforts you expect from a hotel. It's not that the front desk staff is being rude or unfriendly, but rather it's not their responsibility to take care of rooms that don't belong to them. Owners who rent their rooms out themselves must also service their rooms themselves. So, by all means, stay at the Daytona Inn Beach Resort.

Unfortunately, the unit we ended up with was well worn, obviously decorated with thrift store purchases, and barely clean. The mattress on one of the beds was so hard, we might as well have been sleeping on the floor. It's a good thing there was just the two of us, I can't imagine anyone being able to sleep on it. There was a very nice balcony, but the only furniture on there was two very cheap plastic \"dollar store\" chairs---a small table to hold a drink while enjoying the view would have been a nice touch. Apparently some of the units are privately owned and some owned by the Inn. From talking to other guests we ascertained that many of the units are beautifully cared for. The lucky folks in them were enjoying accomodations comparable to the Hilton; we, on the other hand, were bunking in a room more like a neglected Motel 6. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the cleanliness a 6; a little sand in the corners doesn't bother me much---after all, we were at the beach. But it does show an inattention to detail, and begs the question...what other shortcuts were taken? The Inn allows pets \"up to 30 lbs\"---which should have kept out the 50+ lb monster that lunged at me on the third floor when I started out of the elevator. Good thing the owner had him on a short leash! On the plus side, the location is great...within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. The pool area is wonderful (except for the music blasting out of the speaker hanging on the wall outside of the \"tiki\" bar. This was right next to the kiddie pool. If I'd had any kids playing in that area I would have complained about the dangerous noise level) and kept scrupulously clean. The view is fantastic. The front desk staff was very accomodating. I read in other reviews that Rhonda is great, and I second that. She should have the title of Concierge. Holly, the bartender at the Tailgater, was also great. The elevators could use a little more elbow grease. I would stay there again, but I would definately want to speak to someone person-to-person when making the reservation instead of taking whatever \"oceanfront studio\" happens to be available at the time I make the request. One more caveat---we were supposed to be joined by a third person on our second night (our nightly rate was for 1-4 persons).

Room also smelled damp. What could you do? Your in for an expo? No time to run from hotel to hotel to check vacancies. Plus there were three parties staying in one location. We chose to make the best of it. We had our own linens, and we went to cleaning. It appeared adequately cleaned. WOW it wasn't. The shower pressure was so bad I rinsed my hair in the sink. Toilet ran constantly so we turned it off at the valve. The beds made so much noise that you dared not moved. The sitting area, well...we chose to never use it.

The property is perfectly located directly on the beach at the end of Speedway Blvd so it's easy to find and is centrally located.

This is a little more private, safe non driveable beach but within walking distance of everything (shops, main street, boarwalk, restaurants, etc.). Anyway, great room, clean, nice staff, nice complex, great little pool bar, very pet friendly (35 pet deposit), great all around. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a teenager. It was nice to have the seperate room plus there were plenty of things (girls, other kids, girls, beach, pool, girls, boardwalk arewa,and did I mention girls) So two thumbs up, you will not be disappointed.

Apparently most of these travelers have not stayed at many Daytona Beach hotels.

First let me tell EVERYONE who cares to read this: you will ALWAYS pay a higher premium for ANY hotel in Daytona during peak summer months and surrounding special events. I am so sick of hearing \"$200 an night is outrageous\". Sure I wouldn\u2019t pay $200 for this room under normal circumstances but again I came down during a special event. I actually booked 2 rooms this last weekend at this hotel. $179 for non-beachfront and $199 for beachfront. Both rooms were studios and were appointed about the same. both had tile floors, small kitchenette, tv, and balcony. Both were on the 1st floor. Rooms 120 & 128. Overall the rooms were reasonably clean and well appointed. The rooms do show some signs of wear and exposure to the beachfront elements. Another thing people who don\u2019t live on the ocean don\u2019t get is that the salt affects EVERY hotel in Daytona Beach so you will see some signs of rust and deterioration no matter where you stay. The hotel has a very nice lounge/restaurant. Prices are reasonable. Food is fair. Overall this hotel is nice and very comparable to most in Daytona Beach. It is not extravagant or luxurious but it is adequate. I rated this hotel a 4 compared to \"other hotels in the area\" not hotels elsewhere.

The room was smaller than I expected, It was very dirty. What was really gross was the tub, it looked like it needed to be bleached it was so black. The bath mat looked like it was about 20 years old as well and never washed. The bed we slept on was hard as a rock and so I had horrible back pains. I also found hair on the pillows and sheets which grossed me out. The room comes equipped with a complimentary coffee machine with coffee... that was dirty with dried up coffee... one night there was band playing music from 8pm-3am nearby that kept us awake. We paid over 220$ with taxes and fees for two nights.. totally not worth it. Don't even bother! The free breakfast was a joke and you are better driving to starbucks.

We walked to and from the stadium with ease. We dined at a Chili's nearby as well. There was a freeway outside the room and it would have proven to be loud had we not drunk so much beer. I would stay here again if I was going to a Chargers game. There were a ton of fans using the hotel for the same purposes and it was a great atmosphere. The hotel met our expectations but I would not use it as a base of operations for seeing San Diego. Rest assured that there are multiple other options within the city or closer to beaches.

The only good thing is that it's close to the Grantville station of the San Diego Trolley.

We typically opt for nightlife and nicer accommodations - one of our faves is Hotel Solamar. That said, I researched a number of hotels near qualcomm and found this one to have the most favorable outlook considering I wanted to stay in a semi-decent place that wasn't filthy but also wasn't pricey. Long story short: it was a TERRIFIC CHOICE! Check-in was smooth and the reception was efficient. Parking was near the room and we didnt mind climbing the stairs to our 3rd floor room (not sure if they had an elevator). The room is TINY but was very clean. The stacked appliances (microwave, fridge, safe) were convenient, although we did not use them. The bathroom was clean. The only negative was the archaic tube/box TV in the room that evoked a motel-ish feel to the room. Before game time we walked to the trolley station (3 min walk) from the hotel room, bought our all-day pass ($5/person) and waited (5 min) for the next trolley. After a 5 min ride and 3 min walk down the walkway we were at qualcomm! Very convenient and very efficient, much to our happiness. The return trip was even more convenient b/c almost everyone was headed in the opposite direction so our wait time for the trolley was insignificant compared to those headed back to Seau's/other direction- that was a great surprise and really sealed the deal relative to our acknowledgment that this was the best way for an out of towner to avoid long waits/crowds and attend a game at qualcomm. For that purpose, I highly recommend! Some reviews mentioned that the rooms were noisy b/c of the adjacent freeway, but we asked for a quieter room and got one opposite the freeway. Must do. I used the free PC/internet in the lobby which I have no complaints about. The free breakfast is a nice touch but I say skip it and go to the best breakfast spot around - The Mission (North Park) which you can get to in less than 20 mins. In fact, we were planning to go the location near the Gaslamp District but to our surprise and delight, found that they had a location so close to us.

This was our first visit to the Qualcomm Stadium area (football Sunday - January 3rd) and it was so convenient! Yards away from the trolley station, and a small walk up the hill. We drove from Los Angeles, arriving in the area at approximately 11:30AM. The hotel was just off the freeway. Clean, parking lot, ample spaces. Nice lobby with a small concession fridge that sold juices, snacks, etc. The clerk secured our room for an early check-in and told us to enjoy the game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was it! Totally hassle free and two minutes later we walked five minutes up the hill to the trolley station and purchased an all day pass for $5.00. Parking in the trolley lot looked like it was an absolute nightmare, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about it! We had already parked at the hotel in front of our room. Literally 15 minutes later we were exiting the station and walked right IN to Qualcomm stadium. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had an easier trip! Back at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our bed was so comfortable and the room was immaculate. No weird stains, odors or issues whatsoever. Even the spacious bathroom & shower had an adjustable head for me to wash off the shame of the Redskins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 loss to the Chargers. (Boo!) Nice complementary amenities, phone in the bathroom and crisp, bright vanity lighting. There was a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all pristine. Closet space was ample, and we even had a sitting area with table and two chairs. We seriously contemplated staying an additional night because the room was so awesome. Before booking, I initially saw other comments regarding the surroundings of the hotel. True \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the neighborhood seemed like an industrial setting, but I mean, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleeping outside. It is safe and QUIET- there are gas stations, stores and restaurants including a Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within view of the hotel lot, and after partying so much at the game (complete with $9.00 beers!!! Yikes!!!), we just wanted a place to crash and burn afterwards. There was also a HUGE dining room and continental breakfast that I actually didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice until checking out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so sorry I missed it! This hotel tops my recommendation of BEST hotels to stay for a visit to the Qualcomm Stadium or any locals adjacent to the trolley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (Old Town, Downtown, etc.) A+ to the pleasant staff at both check-in and check-out.

The previous reviews were written when this property was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSuper 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Now it is a Ramada. Apparently the new owner has decided to invest in the property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it shows. I stayed there for several days and I noticed that the whole exterior has been repainted, the pool area and the breakfast area look renovated. They told me there are new beds and bathrooms as well. While I was there, there were paving crews doing some minor asphalt repairs to what looked like a redone parking lot. The staff was helpful and friendly. I would say they are aiming for 2.5 star status\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The complementary breakfast had small cheese omelets occasionally in addition to the regular toast, make-your-own waffles, cereal and yogurt. Heading others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advice, I requested to stay on the top (3rd) floor and found it very quiet. My room had a decent-sized fridge and microwave. They have a mini-mart in the lobby that sells some frozen dinners, drinks, snacks, etc. Free Wi-Fi is available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is very hit or miss though. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get reception in my room, but it seemed to work very well by the pool. There is also a PC in the lobby area for guests to use\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it is using the same wireless network though.. so it can be hit or miss as well. Cons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the comments made about the location still apply of course. There is lots of highway noise if you are facing the highway, and the view from the rear of the building isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picture postcard material. I found being close to the highway on/off ramp a bonus though. The only windows in each unit face the corridor, so if you leave the curtains open, everyone walking by can see in. Also, there is a surprise $1 per day additional charge at check-in for the room safe that is not included in your quoted price. Area: There is a Starbucks very close to the Ramada for your morning coffee (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the coffee they offer at breakfast). There are lots of restaurants on Mission Gorge Road as well as a Vons grocery store. A 5 minute drive down Mission Gorge Road takes you to Mission Trails park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a large city park that makes you think you are in the mountains.. worth checking out. Conclusion: For a clean, decent 2/2.5 * room at a great price (I got mine through Expedia) at a hotel with good staff that is obviously is trying hard, I say go for the Ramada Qualcomm.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cI highly recommend this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "steve1616", "ReviewID": "UR19362673", "Content": "My family and I decided to spend a few days down in San Diego.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, it may have been a stayover in which the beds were made but not changed and then only one bed was unmade when the last people checked out and only the one bed may have gotten cleaned by the maid on the day of checkout. Or they could have been stained (Bleach them then Super 8) However...I will NEVER stay in this motel again because that totally grosses ME out.

I woke up to being cold, the bed was hard, hearing the plastic flapping in the wind, and the people shouting across the way. (I literally came home with a tremendous earache and had to go the doctor for an inner ear infection.) We complained to management when we checked out and they took a whole $20.00 off per night.

A short cab ride will get you to a Bears, Bulls or Hawks game and if you want to go to a Sox game or to see that other National League team in town, you can always take your car in and out of valet as often as you like without an additional charge. The $47 a day valet charge isn't cheap, but at least you have some flexibility and the car stays on site. The hotel is a short walk to Gino's East, Magnificent Mile Shopping, Navy Pier, etc. and there is plenty of night life in the area because this is also the gold coast area of Chicago with plenty of high rise condos. The hotel offers a free breakfast in the morning and your kitchen is fully stocked so you can prepare meals or just have some breakfast food on hand for the mornings.

Nothing wrong with the in-laws of course but as our family has grown quarters have grown tight at their house so we felt it was time to branch out. I can say after spending 4 nights at the Residence Inn in downtown Chicago we made an excellent choice. The location is fantastic. Right by Michigan Avenue. A few blocks from the lake. Just right in the heart of Chicago. I was actually shocked by how cheap we were able to get the room considering the location and the holiday weekend but I wasn't going to argue. The room was huge. Plenty of space for our family of 4 to spread out. With two toddler age kids room to roam is important and they had plenty of room to play. The free breakfast was good. Nothing historic but it met expectations. The one downside I will point out is parking is a bit expensive. While the parking was high the valet attendants were very friendly and moved quickly when you needed your car.

I love that hotel, so I have never thought to look elsewhere. I also love Chicago, and never pass up a chance to visit. When my wife had a conference at the Four Seasons, I decided to come with her, and being a loyal Marriott patron I booked this hotel, which was just a few block away (the conference hotel was too pricey). For those who aren't familiar, Residence Inn is an apartment/extended stay brand of the Marriott chain. Our one bedroom suite contained a small kitchen, a living room and a separate bedroom. In fact, it was larger than many apartments I rented when I was younger. When I came into the lobby and got in the elevator, I could see that the brass around the doors had seen a lot of wear. I was expecting to see some signs of age in the rooms, but they must have been renovated recently because they were in fine shape. We stayed four nights and had a very pleasant time. The hotel is located right in the heart of the \"magnificent mile\". We bought a three day CTA pass and had no problems getting around either by bus or on the L. It was close to shopping, the lake and museums. They're aren't many downsides. One is that the elevators are older and a bit slow, so expect a wait, especially during busy times. The breakfast buffet was just okay, your standard eggs, sausage, muffins, etc. I would have preferred more fruit. The Internet service (free of charge) was worth every penny (grin) but worked acceptably most of the time. If you are looking for a nice lake view, this hotel isn't for you, as it is several blocks from the water and there is a large building between it and the lake.

The building was situated so that you got very little street noise, at least from my room 1108. The street is quiet but you are just around the corner from all the glitter and excitement of the Magnificent Mile. The Residence Inn was your standard variety Residence Inn with its usual very good quality and excellent value for money. They honored U.S. Federal Government per diem rates, so it was an excellent value to get a suite for $190 per night in the heart of downtown . Everything was very clean and the one bedroom suite was spacious. The mattress was a bit soft but not so it hurt my back. They had the usual wonderful Residence Inn hollofil pillows that seem to act like feather pillows--don't know how they do this or where I could get some for home but I really like them. The furniture was beginning to show signs of wear (especially on the arm chair armrests) but not unless you looked carefully. The staff were extraordinarily friendly and helpful. The location was wonderful and Chicago is a very walkable city, so I took full advantage of walking to the many great shops, stores, and restaurants after my meetings were finished. It was also convenient to public transport buses and subways. I could walk to a Trader Joe's, and there's a full service post office in the building of the John Hancock Center, which is just around the corner. A 24-hour Walgreens is also close by. Filene's Basement, Nordstrom Rack, the Disney Store, and an Apple Store were all within a few blocks. A Chipotle restaurant was a bit further walk but under 15 minutes. Everything was so convenient The breakfast was standard Residence Inn fare, which is to say it was high quality and abundant, but like every other Residence Inn the coffee is a bit ordinary. There was plenty of seating during the morning rush hour of buffet grazers. I was not there for the evening meal, so I can't comment on that. They do not have a business center with computer access like some Residence Inns. I was not traveling with my computer so I could not take advantage of their free wi-fi broadband service.

There are three small elevators (capacity of about six/seven passengers each), one of which is for pets. Yes, in addition to being family friendly it is also pet friendly. The valet/bell captain outside front entrance even has bowls with dog biscuits for the pets. Valet car service is expensive $45.00 / night.The front service desk representative is also the conceige. There is taxi service in front of the hotel. The hotel is situated away from the hustle and bustle of Michigan avenue, in a quiet residential-apartment-condo neighborhood area.

On arrival our standard suite was not ready, so we were upgraded to a deluxe 2 Bedroom suite. The kitchenette, living and dining area, master bedroom, second bedroom, closets, and cabinets, dressers gave the traveler a feeling of living in a condo apartment. There were three 35 inch flat screen televisions (one in each bedroom and the living room). The main drawback, and reason that my overall rating is a four (very good) and not a five(excellent) is because of the bathroom. Our bathroom was so small it seemed to be the size of our pantry at home. The sink was located outside of the toliet and combination tub and shower. When you were using the toliet,you were very close, almost on top of the tub/shower. There was a door to the area of the toliet/tub/shower for privacy, but most of the time you kept it open because of the close quarters. So, when I was at the sink, the door knob kept hitting me on the back side. On one occassion I must have slammed the door shut to hard because it locked from the inside. Fortunately, all of our business had been taken care of before the door locked. We notified the front desk, and when we returned three hours later, maintenance had the door opened. Thereafter during our four night stay we were more carefull when using the sink. On one occasion I stayed in the suite, while housekeeping was attending to the suite. I could not believe the thourghness of the staff. UNBELIEVABLE! In addition to the regular cleaning they polished all mirrors, mirror frames, picures, picture frames, tables, and counters.

I don't mind kids at all, but I draw the line at having to share a hotel with dogs. It's really an \"Eff You\" to most of us who do not travel with dogs. Having said that, and realizing that Chicago is a pricey town (much to my syrprise), you could easily stay somewhere outside the downtown area and be just as satisfied because you can get pretty much anywhere in downtown Chicago for like a $7 cab ride or a short ride on the El. However, the Chicago subway system is not really as ubiquitousas say the NYC subway system so in spots you have to walk quite a bit to get to a station. I'd stay here again for around $150 a night.

They were rude to the woman who had the temerity to ask for cream cheese ten minutes before breakfast was supposed to end, rude to the woman who couldn't find the ketchup, rude to the guy who had a question about the waffle maker, and boy am I glad I'm not the guy who tried to grab a something from their little fridge at dinner (\"That's for breakfast!\"). Breakfast and dinner are both offered for relatively short windows of time, and about half an hour before the meals are supposed to end, they stop restocking. One woman on the staff turned away one poor guest who came down for breakfast slightly later than 9:30 (he came down at 9:35 according to my phone, but apparently was 10 minutes late if you go by the \"official\" clock by the reception desk), and then she immediately turned around and started urgently dumping the trays of danish and muffins in the trash. She couldn't have at least offered that guy one of the muffins that she was about to throw away? It created a really unpleasant atmosphere in which to eat. Who wants to have their food served up to them by such hostile, unpleasant people? I ended up spending money going out. The ultimate irony was the weekend morning when one of the servers sang what she called their \"mission statement.\" All about how great their service is, and how the guests \"tell stories about us.\" Oh, I've been telling my friends stories about them, all right, but not good ones... In their defense, they seemed to be extremely busy -- maybe they are so understaffed that it's a huge ordeal just each meal out, and maybe anyone would get crabby under the circumstances. I definitely think the hotel needs to expand the amount of time they serve breakfast and dinner, to avoid the frantic crush of people all trying to grab food at the same time, and they should probably add a staff person or two (or rearrange the shifts). But, yeah, the service on the buffet was pretty awful, awful enough to motivate me to write my first negative review. (And while I'm complaining: they always stop putting out plates after the first 30-40 minutes or so, and anyone who comes later has to eat off paper plates. It's a lot nicer (and less wasteful) to eat off real plates with real silverware. The hotel internet (both wifi and ethernet) was slow and glitchy, and, since it's a hotel that supposedly caters to business travelers, they should really fix that.

Our timing was the biggest problem as we had a mini-van full of stuff and needed to conduct our business starting at noon at a place we really were not familiar with in downtown Chicago. So the best thing was the Residence Inn let us check in at 10:30 in the morning. That was a huge help and much appreciated. The doorman was very helpful in getting us to the room and pointing out a quick place for breakfast. It is kind of a hassle to check in as the desk is on the floor above street level. So you have to take the lobby elevators to the floor then another set of elevators to your room. It is a bit time consuming but a nice security feature. The room was just fine, just what you might expect at a Residence inn with a small kitchenette, small dining/work table, and a sleeping area with the sofa. All were very comfortable. As with every hide-a-bed, the bar in the middle drives you nuts when you extend out the bed. So we pulled the mattress off the hide-a-bed and put it on the floor for sleeping. The king-size bed probably could have fit all three of my wife, my son and I but ... The internet connection worked great. The iron, coffee maker, tv, temp control, shower, etc. all worked just fine. Being downtown was a little loud but expected. We used the hot tub, it was not overly hot and not overly crowded. The breakfast was good, I made a waffle and the sausages were fine. The coffee was less than mediocre. For Parking, I parked at a self-park place a block away and saved about $8. But it is still $28 for the weekend day. That's a real pain in the wallet.

We had to call the main desk from our 21st floor elevator phone for help, they were there within seconds to help us. No worries, you have to have ID though before they will let you in the room, or get it once the door opened, a good policy I must say. And the hot tub closed early one night for maintence when we really needed it. The next day they must have put too many chemicals in it cause my legs to break out and itched terribly. I didnt go back in it after that. We ate breakfast on the suite side. There is a definet difference from the residence and the suites in the lobby and the breakfast. The difference is in the comfort of the chairs in the eating area and computer area, not the staff though. Upon our departure we had several hours before our train departure.

The free breakfast buffet was surprisingly good and hearty, lacking only bacon which only my wife missed. We made waffles our last morning there.

Not to mention you will boil in the tight tub/shower/toilet room with no fan with no room to move, to stepping out into freezing open sink/mirror tiny exposed cube area.

If you forgot something from your suitcase in the bedroom, let's run in front of everyone around wall into bedroom and back again to sink/mirror.

The separate bedroom is spacious with plenty of closet space and one dresser with few drawers that the large flat screen hdtv sits atop. Therefore, not much drawer space or counter space because of tv on top. BUT what about A mirror anywhere in the bedroom (I could find a few places to put some sort of dressing mirror, maybe on back of bedroom door, you think?), being that there is only one mirror publicly exposed, nope, UGH?!?!

They will tell you there are ice trays, nope, that we have to turn the freezer ice machine on and flick the bar, no ice 8 hrs later.

I got it for $99.00 on Priceline and was able to add air fare on American for less than what I would have paid on all the major travel web sites for air and hotel combined. That said, I enjoyed my short time at the Residence Inn (June 11-14). There's not a whole lot I can add that hasn't already been addressed in previous reviews, but I will try. The Thursday night I was there, they had a Chicken Ceasar Salad and Soup night for the \"Manager's Reception.\" It appears they do something different each Thursday night of the month. I had already eaten, but I tried the salad and it was not too bad. I did not try the soup. They had Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite on tap. However, one tap ran out (the Miller Lite) and the other one was spewing foam. One of the hotel staff members worked on it and finally started pouring beer from the tap into pitchers and taking them around and filling up people's cups. After a while, she just filled the pitchers and left them by the tap. It took me a while to find the wine. Turns out the wine (red) is in a dispenser much like what one might use to dispense orange juice, so it was a little confusing. They have other themes during the week like Bar-be-que on Wednesday night, hot dogs on Tuesday, I believe. etc. As for breakfast, one morning they had scrambled eggs and patty sausage and the next day it was scrambled eggs and link sausage. There were a couple of waffle machines and they had fruit, cereal, bread, on so on. The room was nice. I liked the big shower versus the usual bath tub with shower. The only complaint I would have is my room faced Walton and I could hear alot of the street noise and rowdy folks out front, but no big deal. I found it weird that the in-room literature said there was no need to get ice as I could get it from the ice-maker in the fridge. I then opened the fridge to find two empty ice trays. While I was there the TV channels went digital and CBS and HBO disappeared. Not sure why that happened. Someone mentioned a store \"behind\" the hotel. It is actually on a side street. You have to go down some stairs to get there. The night I went there were some questionable characters at the top of the stairs asking me if I wanted my shoes shined. I was wearing tennis shoes, so I passed on the shoe shining and decided to pass on going down the stairs to the store. I turned around and walked the few steps back to the hotel. I was in town for the NeoCon show at the Merchandise Mart. I took a cab a few times and the cost was $6.25 - $6.75. For some reason, the cabs leaving the hotel added $.50 to the trip that wasn't added on the way back. I did discover I could catch the 125 Water Tower Express from in front of the Hancock Building and it was only $2.25. It would drop me off in front of the Merchandise Mart on Wells and pick me up in front on Ontario. I was also able to bus it over to the Cadillac Theater to see a Broadway play (Mary Poppins - fun show even for a 54 year old guy). I took a cab back to the hotel and it was still only $6.00 - $7.00. As other folks have noted, Michigan Ave. is only two blocks away and you can go a block or two the other direction and be at the water. You can see the fireworks from there that they shoot off from the Navy Pier every Wednesday and Saturday night. Eats wise, I hit Gene and Georgetti's Steak House. Itailian wait staff, white table cloths. Steaks are high dollar and my strip steak was incredibly thick. Don't think I would go back there, though....$62.00 with tip for one. Hit the Billy Goat Tavern for a \"Cheesborger.\" It's OK, but nothing outstanding. Gino's East is good for pizza. Tried some Chicago Dogs. They were OK, too, but wasn't impressed.

Very clean and comfortable with great beds, water pressure and a/c. Also, thick walls - couldn't hear anything down the hall. 3 tvs in the suite with about 35 channels. Great flat screen tvs. Location was great - 3 blocks to Oak St Beach, 2 block to Hancock Bldg, 3 blocks to Water Tower. Just couldn't beat the location. It is on a quiet street right off the mag. mile. 1 mile walk to Navy pier. About 6 blocks to red line train that takes you to wrigley. Had a very nice exercise room with 2 elipticals, 3 treadmills, 2 bikes and some weights. Very adequate. Front desk was quite helpful and well staffed - there was never any long wait at the desk. The only issue I had with hotel = the breakfast hours. They go from 6-9am which is fine most of the year. In the summer they need to go til 930 or 10am so people can stagger their times they go down there. Just isn't much room between 8-9am bc people know it is going to close at 9am. If they knew it was 10am they could come later thus reducing the congestion. That was an annoyance that could be avoided during summer tourist season. Breakfast itself was pretty good with some great steamed oatmeal. Just didn't like to stand while I ate bc of no tables. 25 dollar cab fare from Midway to hotel. I loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again in the future.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL Northern Suburbs", "Title": "\u201cSpacious and clean - but a few problems\u201d", "Author": "sublimegrrl333", "ReviewID": "UR18352021", "Content": "We love Chicago and wanted to spend a long weekend there with the kids (twin toddlers). We booked a 2 bedroom suite. The hotel room (corner suite, room 915) was nice, very spacious and very clean. Modern decor which was a plus. Kids enjoyed it very much. Beds were comfortable and having a real functional kitchen with the room was more than what we expected. The complimentary breakfast buffet was okay (not great , but pretty good for being free). It's very crowded after 9. You can easily walk to Water Tower, Bloomingdales, and Cheesecake Factory. Great location. Overall we really liked it and would have given it an excellent rating if it weren't for these 2 pitfalls: 1) The toilet wobbled when sitting on it. And I'm not talking about just the seat. The WHOLE toilet moved a bit whenever you sat on it. Maybe the seal wasn't properly put it place or something??hmmm...not sure. Not a good feeling when sitting on it though. Not sure if all the rooms had this problem. 2) We asked for extra blankets. It took a while for someone to bring some (maybe it was rush hour, who knows). And when they did bring the blankets, we were surprised to see that the spare blankets were so old and visibly worn out - that if you held them up you could see all the holes and frays. Those blankets were so old and worn that I would have given them away to a thrift store a long time ago. It was a little shocking because in stark contrast the linens that they DID use for the beds seemed new and fresh. Didn't make sense Everything else seemed good. Like I said if it weren't for those 2 points, I would have given a perfect score.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western PA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!

The breakfast and hospitality hours are pretty typical for a Residence Inn, which is to say that it's pretty decent for being complimentary. The location is excellent for shopping on the the Magnificent Mile and Watertower Place, going to the top of the Hancock Tower, jogging along Lakeshore Drive, and the \"beach\".

Stayed in a two-bedroom suite. Very roomy and clean. The beds were so comfortable. They had said that there was construction, as they are renovating, and we heard nothing at all. It was a Friday, therefore, the workers could have gone for the day. We had the breakfast in the morning and it was a delicious hot breakfast with eggs, biscuits and gravy, and an array of other breakfast items. Everyone I talked to at the front desk were very accommodating. We have stayed at this hotel for several years and still like this one. It is so convenient to the Magnificent Mile, Water Tower Place, and the John Hancock Center. It is a one to two minute to walk to all three. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the bottom of the John Hancock Center, so that is a great place to eat. I will continue to go back to this hotel when I stay in Chicago - it is great!!!!

Popular spot, but never had any line or table issues. Hotel is located right by red line, across the street from a Jewel-Osco, on top of a Subway/Starbucks. Mag Mile within a few blocks, Gino's East was excellent, 1 block north then a couple west on Ontario and Wells (bring a marker and write on wall, table, chairs)!! Get a CTA pass at a CVS (1-day $7 - 3-day $14). Chicago's public transit is so easy to catch on to and very reliable. The city is Huge and this was a great way for us to get to Lakeview, Science Museum, Bulls game, Lincoln Park/DePaul, back to Lakeview to see a show at ComedySportz Chicago (awesome!!), Shedds Aquarium (we were there for 4 days).

Nice to have since traveling with a baby. Breakfast is complimentary. Long lines for the made to order omelets but you can surpass the line and grab other hot items, cereal, bagels, etc... There is a pool which I did not use. It is enclosed by glass and other guests sitting in the lounge area can see in the pool area. I don't care to have people gawking at me...especially since there is a free cocktail hour nightly (manager's reception) and this is located right next to the pool area. The cocktail hour was decent, some free apps like chips and cheese. Your allowed to have as many drinks as you want during the cocktail hour. You may order only one drink at a time. They do not limit how many times you go up for another though. They will card you, so bring your ID with you. Goood way to save some money before heading out on the town.

The remotes themselves had all the numbers and information rubbed off, I assume from frequent use. They should have been replaced. The drain in the shower was partially clogged resulting in a slow running drain. My wake-up call came a ridiculous 15+ minutes before the time I requested (using the automated system). I didn't want to get up that early. The room temperature was difficult to control and it was either too hot or cold, even shifting the thermostat one degree. The outlets in the room are poorly placed. I want to charge my iPhone on the nightstand (where it is also my back-up alarm-so it requires power to avoid draining the battery) but there was no place close to plug it in. So I complained about these items in the morning. The front desk person acted as if she could not care less.

There wasn't a lot of LIGHT in the room, but it was also cloudy outside, so maybe that played a factor as well. Certainly not the fanciest hotel in the world, but plenty spacious and comfortable enough for a couple of days visit.

The Chicago Tribune is a few blocks away, and when I was there, that big Marilyn Monroe statue was still out front--very neat. Plenty of restaurants and stores are nearby as well (there's a Jewel/Osco store just down the block, and a Walgreens a couple of blocks away).

Not adjoining rooms, but it was nice to be right next door to each other. Rooms were spacious enough for us and all the shopping we did! The beds themselves were comfortable, although the sofa sleeper in one room sagged in some and, since I was relegated to that one night, my night's sleep wasn't the best. Not awful, but not as comfortable as in an actual bed (which I had slept in the night before). Both of our rooms did overlook the adjacent parking garage, but since we weren't in the rooms that often, it didn't bother us too much. We could hear some noise from the atrium/waterfalls and during the cocktail hour, but nothing too loud. The nightly manager's reception was great and not as packed as the one I've been too when staying at the Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown/Lakefront. The bartenders were friendly and efficient at keeping the line moving, but the sangria tasted as if it had been sitting for too long. The hummus, veggies, and other assorted snacks were tasty after a day of shopping and sightseeing! Hotel is in a great location if you're looking for lots of restaurants! Weber Grill was across the street, Starbucks and Subway in the same building, PF Chang's was close, Lawry's was down the street, etc. Also extremely convenient to Michigan Avenue.

Much to say about this hotel, almost all positive. The rooms are spacious, and of course being a suite it is rooms, not room. Although I was traveling alone on this trip it would have been perfect had my family been with me. You could put the kids to sleep in one room and stay up a bit in the other with a flatscreen TV, desk, and couch. Beds were clean and comfortable. All amenities as they should be, and having a frig in the room always a plus. The breakfast included with the room is on an entirely different scale from your typical chain hotel free breakfast. This wasn't some cereal and a wafflemaker. They had a large grill going and made eggs and three egg omelets to order. You just want egg whites? No problem. Your choice of fresh ingredients in your omelet. There was also french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, juice, cocoa, oatmeal, cereal, toast. The only thing I didn't see was a wafflemaker, which I didn't miss. Even though it was busy, lines were not excessive for both of my breakfasts. I didn't have to eat until dinner after this breakfast, which rivaled a breakfast from Perkins for free. Speaking of dinner, every night the hotel had a free reception from for two hours with some appetizers (taco chips and salsa, etc.) and drinks - as in free drinks. Soft drinks, beer, wine, cocktails were all available to guests at no charge. This again was something I'd never seen before in a chain at this price point. The location is very good, walking distance to Michigan Avenue in a central River north location, lots of restaurants nearby. The building shows no signs of wear. Nice place. Only flaw, the exercise room adjacent to the pool was closed. Not sure why. They had moved three or four pieces of equipment to another room as a temporary workout area, but this was inadequate. I assume whatever the problem was in the original room, which looked like a nice workout area, will be rectified shortly. All in all an excellent stay. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the price was reasonable.

I was afraid I was going to miss my flight. We had to hide our luggage behind the planters for the cabs to even pull over. The nice door guy tried so hard too! So what happened? I arrived at the airport (I was checked in online) slightly under the 45 minutes to drop off my one checked bag, so I had to reschedule my flight to 3:30pm or beg to see if my bag would make it then hustle to my gate.

As the name implies, every room is a suite and comes with a fridge, a microwave, two flat screen TVs, a settee (which I believe is a pull out bed too). Our bedroom was a little small, but had king size bed with very comfortable mattress and pillows. As to the value--well, decide for yourself--there is a manager's special happy hour every evening and a hot breakfast buffet with made to order omelette station. I quite liked their breakfast. I admit my price might have been a little low, because I stayed there as a part of a conference, but I thought it was reasonable value for money. Would I stay there for the price I was quoted outside of the conference? Probably not. Or I would try to find a bargain price on one of the discount websites.

We flew in to Midway via Southwest, and opted to take the train in to the city. We had one changeover, and then the train dropped us about a block from the hotel. It cost us $5 instead of $40 if we had taken a cab. Secondly, the location. As I said my wife had never been to Chicago and was on her own during the day. This hotel is conveniently located to all the major shopping, there are a ton of good restaurants nearby, and you are a short walk to the train, and a free trolley to Navy Pier. Third, the rooms. Embassy Suites are nice because they are suites. The rooms are nice and spacious...and always clean. Fourth, breakfast. It is included in the price of the room and it is a great deal...especially if you are traveling with kids (which we weren't). It is a full breakfast, not just coffee, juice, and some danish that have just been removed from the wrapper.

I was planning on going back to that restaurant anyway, because I loved it so much on a previous trip, and was quite pleasantly surprised by it being next to the hotel I was staying at. The suite is great- nice to have so much space in a downtown hotel, as well as a centralized atrium (many Chicago hotels have reaaaally long hallways since they just knocked down walls between 2 older buildings). Obviously Embassy atriums can have a bit of a noise issue, but I didnt have any when I was at this hotel, and I was near the elevator. Its nice having the bedroom further back so you dont hear anything! What can I say - Embassy's have amazing features - free breakfast, spacious suites, a lovely view when you walk out of your room, and a great view at lower levels while having a free cocktail in the lobby. Ahhhh I love Embassy Suites hotel :) The only downside was after hoofing it around Chicago for hours, I was really looking forward to having a nice soak in the hottub but there were a million kids in the pool playing nerf football (I think one NEARLY hit my head). Not the fault of the hotel, at all, it appeared to be a youth sports team or something....it happens! It was a nice pool and hot tub area, anyway.

When we checked in the lobby was packed and we were told that our room was not ready at 5:00 p.m. and that we should go for a walk and come back and it should be ready.

I said that we did confirm this with their staff when we checked in, he said that they consider that this was only a \"special request\"and that they cannot make any committments to us. It was concerning that he didn't make any apologies to us. Clearly we were getting no where with Chip. At the end of the discussion when I asked Chip what he could do to help us out as this was the only \"special request\" we had the reason we selected this hotel, he said that he would see if he could find a room that one of us could move to in the hotel for the duration of the stay and let us know. We never heard back from Chip or any other staff. It is really disappointing that such a simple request could not be handled and that their staff do not work together. For any other people considering this hotel chain I would be leary of putting forward any special requests, it seems as though central reservations will say what they can to get you to book but they have no connection with the hotels themselves and the hotel staff need training on customer service.

We had to wait about an hour. The room was fine, although one of the remote controls was missing. Also, as with most Embassy Suites, it was pretty noisy, with children running around and looking over the balconies and such. But that was to be expected.

The hotel is in the middle of downtown and close to a lot of things. Highly recommend the valet parking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about $50/night but the security is worth it. The hotel was full all three nights we were there and the noise proved it. Thankfully, we were on the 6th floor so we were a little above the din. We were allowed to check in early (in the A.M.) which was great so we could put things in the room and go and catch a Cubs game (the best part of the trip!!) When we checked in the room was warm and there was no air coming out of the front air vent. I mentioned this to the desk clerk (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll call her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClerk A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) who said that she would call someone to look at it. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. When we got back nothing had been done and I had to call maintenance. Turns out that previous occupants had closed the vent. Anyway, the room was dated and could have been cleaned better and the A/C could have worked better. The breakfast was standard but very crowded. After breakfast I had to discuss a bill problem with the desk. I was charged for two internet charges because, evidently, the internet access is charged per device. When will ES start giving free internet like everyone else?? I went down and talked with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClerk A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and she said that she would remove one of the charges. Again, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t (although it was after I was gone that I found that this charge was not removed). Wow. I love the efficiency of these highly motivated employees!!! I had also discussed with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClerk A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because that I had three different confirmation numbers for my stay. I discussed this with her because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be locked out of my room. What a surprise: she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen!!!! We came back from touristy stuff and found our keys didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Why wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I surprised?? The rest of our time there I avoided \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClerk A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 like the plague! The rest of our stay was pretty uneventful. We enjoyed the town and did about all the touristy stuff a family could possibly cram into 3 days. So who is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClerk A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?? I wish I knew. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to wear a name tag like everyone else and she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very nice. In fact I thought she was rude and curt with her answers.

Based on past experience with Embassy Suites (ES) and other reviewer comments, I headed to the Embassy Suites in Downtown Chicago. Note: there are 2 ES properties in Chicago (Downtown and Lakefront). This review is based on the downtown location. Like all ES, you get the standard setup of a two-room suite, full order breakfast and manager's cocktail event. However, unlike the ES in Washington, DC, this ES goes by the clock and shuts down service right on the dot (unless there are people still in line). I wish ES would extend the midweek breakfast time until 10:30am, but breakfast stops at 9:30AM on the dot. I even saw the cook there with a watch, waiting for the exact moment to turn off the lights for the cooked-to-order breakfast. However, you are able to get pre-cooked food from the warmer beyond the 9:30AM deadline. This is also true for the manager's cocktail session, which runs 5:00PM-7:30PM. Be there before the cut-off, because a grate is erected on the bar, and it is closed on time. So, beside these annoyances, the Downtown property is a most convenient location. You don't really need to ride in a taxi and may occassionally ride the bus. We found the restaurants all within a 2-block radius. No need to venture any further than that to eat. There is even a full grocery store (similar to the West Coast's Whole Foods) directly across the street. Just below the hotel on the side, is a little burger establishment called, \"M-Burger.\" Don't miss out on a single burger for a mere $2.49. Much better, in my opinion, than any \"In-&-out Burger.\" The staff are most friendly. Dine in or enjoy the summer weather outside. Just 2 blocks beyond this, is the famous Portillo's restaurant. Go there on an empty stomach. Across the street from Portillo's is the Hard Rock Cafe, and the bus stop for the Hop-on-Hop-Off stop. Get the 3-day pass for $31.50 for unlimited rides throughout the city. Down 1 block toward the grocery store (Jewel Osco at the corner of the 7-11), catch the free blue-colored Navy Pier trolley. You will be at Navy Pier in out 10 minutes. Really, everything you need is within walking distance, and if you need to ride the bus, the cost (as of July 2011) is $2.25 per passenger. Disabled passengers are free! Lastly, I took advantage of the Chicago Visitor's program. This is a 2-4 tour, hosted by the city of Chicago by Chicagoans. Just register at www.chicagogreeter.com and make your tour selections. The meeting point is on Magnificent Mile at the Cultural Center (directly across from Millennium Park). And it's FREE!!

I don't think it's unreasonable, but that's just me. I was coming to Chicago for a mini honeymoon since my husband and I are too swamped to take a big honeymoon right now, but we wanted to do something fun, and wanted to enjoy a few perks that usually come with being a Hilton Honor Gold member. So, we decided on the Embassy Suites Downtown. I should mention that our choices are limited since he is a smoker, but that is his choice so I'm not complaining about non smoking hotels, but it is much more difficult to find a nice hotel that allows smoking. I called the hotel several times to request a smoking city view suite. I explained that it was my honeymoon and I wanted things to be wonderful. I also informed the hotel several times that would would be arriving late (like 11:00 pm) so that they would not give our city view suite to someone else. Fat lot of good that did me. The gentleman who checked us in was not overly friendly, but that was okay. There is no bellhop to assist with luggage which was also okay. The front desk person asked for my husband's name to be put on the room info, which I gave him and asked that he change the name on the reservation to reflect me getting married. He said he couldn't do that due to the Hilton Honors points thing. Fine, no biggie. I was tired and just wanted to get upstairs. Got in the room and found the decor pleasant. Went over to the bedroom window to enjoy the scenery (one of my favorite things about Chicago) and was greeted with...a view a parking garage. How anti climatic. Two windows in the suite and the view was either the hallway or a parking garage. Horrible! Things just went down hill from there. The sheets were very scratchy, the bed and pillows were comfy. The bathroom was so so. Nice granite. The tv remote in the bedroom didn't work--very annoying. The atrium is loud with drunk people in the middle of the night and it echos terribly. My husband called down to the front desk to get a phone number for a restaurant and was greeted as Mr. and then MY maiden name, not the name on the room info. Then the front desk person offered to connect the call to the restaurant for us and we were charged a fee on our room bill for it. Also annoying. We were charged for a bottle of water ($4, 89 cents at the drugstore on the corner) that we didn't drink, the list goes on and on. I expected more from the hotel, given that it was my honeymoon, Gold status, the reviews on here, and the price. There are much better and friendlier hotels in the area. My favorite is the Wit but they don't allow smoking anymore so that's out. Spend your money somewhere else like the Wit or Park Hyatt! I gave it 3 stars due to the location and the great doorman who was working Friday and Saturday nights. It was raining and when he saw me walking down the block he ran over with an umbrella and said \"Welcome home!\" which was the nicest part of my experience BY FAR with the staff there.

I read all of the reviews on Trip Advisor so I was a little leery choosing a hotel that is ranked #30 out of 166 hotels. The hotel was great! It was just as nice as Homewood Suites. We had a corner room that was large enough for the four of us. The rooms were clean, quiet and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a good size as well. We never felt cramped. The location was also pretty good. Because we were there during the non-stop rain, places like Water Tower and Michigan Ave. seemed a bit far. On a sunny day, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the walk would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been nothing at all. Water Tower is about a 15 minute walk. The breakfast was also better than expected but was a bit crowded and a little chaotic on our first morning. They not only had made to order omelets and eggs, they had a wide variety of fresh fruit, not canned, breads, juices, and other pre-made hot breakfast items. The kids LOVED the pool, although it was a bit cold for me. They also have a manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception, I believe 7 days a week. We were surprised they had it on a Sunday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most seem to be M \u00e2\u20ac\u201c TH. It was nice, some chips, a house wine, beer or soda for snacking. Our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get cleaned until we called, which was close to 5:00 p.m., but that may be due to their check out policy at noon. Once we called, they were up in 5 minutes. Overall, the staff all seemed pretty nice. We will definitely be staying here again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe once the rain goes away! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping this review will help move the rank of the Embassy Suites at least into the 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s!", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appleton, WI", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Mom_of_3_WI", "ReviewID": "UR105880824", "Content": "My husband & I took our children (ages 15, 12 & 10) on a quick get-away weekend. We spent one day/night in Milwaukee & one day/night in Chicago. I spent HOURS looking at the reviews and ratings for hotels in Chicago. I finally narrowed it down to 2 that seemed to meet the type of mini-vacation we were looking for. We ended up staying at the Embassey Suites - Downtown in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The 2 room suite was perfect for us with 2 queen beds & then a sofa sleeper in the other room. The beds were very comfortable. During the day, we visited the Shedd Aquarium (unfortunately had to wait 2 hours in line) and then came back to the hotel. We then walked to a nearby restaurant for supper and continued to explore by walking several blocks. For being in such a large city, we felt 100% safe at all times. We then came back to the hotel for the manager's reception. After having read the reviews, I knew that this was not to be taken as a \"free supper\" but more as a snack bar. The snacks consisted of hot pretzel bites (which were very good) & ranch or mustard, fried potato chips, and punch. My husband and I enjoyed FREE drinks (This was great because we didn't have to leave the hotel or spend money) while our kids went back to the room (and could look down on us from above - - which they thoroughly enjoyed). The kids then spent time in the pool (not huge - - medium rectangular shape, but was just fine for our kids). The pool was not overcrowded during our stay - - the kids were in the pool while the adults sat around the outside. My kids enjoyed the pool & hot tub while I worked out on the treadmill in the attached fitness room. On Easter morning, we went down for the FREE breakfast buffet which was EXCELLENT! We had made-to-order omelettes which were very good. Our kids enjoyed pancakes, cereal, sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, bagels/bread, etc. We did not have to eat again until supper time! Overall, we had a refreshing, relaxing, and very enjoyable mini-vacation. I had put in for a city view upgrade if available - - which we got. This provided us with 2 windows which looked out into the city as opposed to a window that looked into the center of the hotel. The only thing to remember is that when you stay in the city and are used to the country. . . it's a bit more difficult to sleep because of the constant sirens throughout the night. Make sure to use the inside curtain/shade which is a room darkener and barrier from the noise (I didn't notice this shade until 6:00 a.m.). This is the only reason I rated the \"sleep quality\" as a 4 instead of a 5. Despite this, we all noted that we would definitely go back in a heartbeat! I really can't imagine us, as a family, having a better time at a hotel than we had here.

The bathroom was a decent size also, and we liked the fact that a second sink + vanity is available in the bedroom.

Just one short shower was enough to completely fog the bathroom, and we had to run the hair dryer and/or slightly open the window in the bedroom to get rid of some of the humidity. Basically, bathroom ventilation system doesn't work. With a family of 5, we often stay at Embassy thanks to the size of their rooms, the usual friendliness of their staff, the pool, the complimentary breakfast, and the manager reception. The business center is also a plus when, like in this case, we needed to print some documents. As HH gold, we had free internet in the room, but for non gold members they charge a fee.

We usually grabbed a drink before heading out for dinner. There was munchies, nachos and meat balls on some days too. The cab ride to Midway airport from the hotel was only $36 including tips and i split that between 3 ppl. It was great! The only thing i have to complain about is that there were bed bugs. On the third night, my friend found a bug crawling on her bed. Without realizing what it really was, she squeezed it and the blood was bright red. we didn't think too much about it at the time. The next night, my other friend got bitten on her forearm. We suspected it was bed bugs at that point but we didn't want to file a complaint until we were 100% sure. When we came home, my friend's arm got itchier. A quick google image search revealed that the bug my friend killed was indeed a bed bug. I have emailed the hotel and waiting for them to get back to me. I hope they will take this seriously. Then again, me and my friends got the deal on priceline.com for $90 per night. i'm not asking for any compensation since we already left, but i just want them to address this situation so no other guests would have to encounter these bed bugs.

Compared to other Chicago hotels I have stayed at, there are five things I particularly liked: 1) Unlike many hotels where the room's \"minibar\" is stuffed with pricey drinks and has sensors that add a fee to your bill even if you just move an item, the refrigerator in my room here was empty, giving me plenty of room for my own things. A small store in the lobby sells bottled drinks and snacks if you want them. 2) Unlike some hotels whose \"free breakfast\" consists of just coffee and donuts or a $10 coupon for a nearby diner, the free breakfast here is a full meal served buffet style in a spacious area and includes scrambled eggs, pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit (oranges, bananas, cantaloupe), bacon, sausage, potatoes & onions, hot oatmeal, cold cereals, toast, juice, coffee, and milk. In addition, you can get omelets and eggs cooked to order in any style. I asked for \"3 eggs over medium\" each day and they were cooked perfectly. 3) The business center is available free and includes four computers with internet access. I could check my email each day and printed my boarding pass at no charge. The previous Chicago hotel I stayed at charged $15 per day for access to their business center plus $1 per page for printing. 4) Unlike some hotels where the \"suites\" are just slightly larger than normal hotel rooms with a sofa, the suites here are two separate, full-sized rooms. The living room has a sofa, large flat screen TV, dining table with four chairs, and a kitchenette with refrig, microwave, and sink. The bedroom has a door that can be closed off from the living room, a dresser, and a second TV. 5) Although this hotel opened almost 20 years ago, the room I stayed in appeared to be newly renovated and was in excellent condition. Given the above points plus the moderate price and the highly convenient and desirable location, I would rate this the best value Chicago hotel I have ever stayed in. Here are some tips: To get both the best view and to minimize potential traffic noise, when checking in ask for \"a high floor room facing east.\" Don't confuse this State Street hotel with the \"Lakefront\" Embassy Suites located 8 blocks away on the east side of Michigan Avenue. Although the Lakefront hotel is closer to Navy Pier if that's important to you, for all other purposes the State Street hotel is probably a better location for most visitors.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "ohio53", "ReviewID": "UR80357111", "Content": "Would highly recommend this hotel.

We had a pretty hectic time trying to find a place to stay, at first. There were so many hotels, and so little time! Finally, we decided to stay at the Lombard Embassy Suites, about 20 minutes from Downtown Chicago. However, when we found that this hotel was right in the middle of Downtown, we switched our reservations right away. We couldn't have had a better trip. Seriously folks, this is the place to stay in Chicago. Everything was very clean when we stayed. The beds were nicely made and the sheets were clean and soft, which many hotels have troubles with. You could tell that the carpet had been cleaned and vaccumed. The bathroom didn't shine, but it was clean as well. You could tell that the hotel tried hard to put its best foot forward as far as cleanliness goes. The lobby and atrium were spick-and-span. The staff was the nicest hotel staff I've ever encountered. Everyone was all smiles all the time. By the end of our 4-day trip the staff knew our names and always greeted us on our visits to the parking garage. The parking is convienient as well, but costly ($44 a day). The location was the best part of our stay, and what makes the hotel most convienient. We walked most everywhere in Chicago, and this hotel is right smack-dab in the middle of downtown, only about a block and a half away from Michigan Avenue. We felt extremely safe and comfortable walking everywhere downtown, and the hotel was easily accessed when we forgot a water bottle or were caught in the rain. In addition, the hotel has a pool for kids. The pool is small, but is enough for 6-7 people to play comfortably. There is also a business lounge, which was a savior for checking e-mail and Facebook. Access to the lounge and pool is free with reservations. Also, hot breakfast is served every morning, and there is something down there to suit everyone. They have cereal, fruit, coffee, milk, hashbrowns, eggs, sausage, bacon, and custom-made omelets, plus other things. Every night there's a Manager's Reception that offers free appetizers to guests (while we were there, they had fried vegetables and salsa chips).

I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past few years, and it is what you would expect from an Embassy Suites.

It is 1 block from the Redline subway station, which will take you to downtown or Wrigley Field. There are tons of restaurants within 2-3 blocks, and Rush street is within easy walking distance. Michigan Ave is 3 blocks away. Buses and cabs are easy to get. The breakfast is better than any other hotel where I have stayed that offers free breakfast (except Homewood Suites) and the free Happy Hour can save you a lot of money in Chicago. Lines can be long for the breakfast and drinks, so plan accordingly. The elevators are full during breakfast on the weekends, and there are typically a lot of kids. Parking is very expensive, use a nearby public garage and save money. The only glitch we had this time was no hot water after a big thunderstorm the night before. Management could have done a better job of explaining the situation to guests. One of our friends room on the 11th floor got flooded, then they were given keys to a room that was occupied - not good.

The location is really great - literally a 5-10 minute walk to almost everything in River North, on many major bus/El/train routes. The lobby was nice, we were greeted personally, the service was good but seemed to be more indifferent after the first day. No worries, we are not big service-seekers. The hotel is set up so the rooms surround an interior atrium. This is good and bad, a little odd. It feels like 'outside' but is actually inside - and a bit noisy. We had one night where a wedding was being held and the noise was really unbearable in the room. I don't think ES should host weddings in their atrium, especially at night - it is very disruptive to the guests. The room was pretty standard ES - not as nice as some others, a tiny bit worn in places, and the bathroom in particular nothing too fancy. The room was clean. I love ES because their rooms are 2 legitimate rooms - inside a king bed, outside the bathroom and a sofa bed. With a family of 4 we made full use of the space. The bed was very comfortable. Even the sofa bed wasn't too bad. There are 2 flat screen TVs in the rooms. The AC worked great. The window opens about 12 inches, which I appreciate in order to get some fresh air. There is internet in the room but it is not free. The housekeeping was about average. Twice our room hadn't been made up by 1 pm, but they were responsive to any requests. The breakfast could have been improved. It didn't feel that 'nice' with a tiled floor and trays, plates, and silverware stacked up like a college dorm cafeteria. I wish they would have varied the items a little more - pancakes and french toast, for example - instead it was the same thing every day, although they did vary between formed hash browns, tater tots, and homestyle hash browns. The food is pretty standard, I like that they'll make an egg white omelet for you every day, with fresh veggies. Overall this place was fine/pretty good. Not as nice as some other ES's, but not bad in any way. Considering the 2 room suite and free cooked breakfast I think it's a good value, especially for families. It could have been a little 'nicer' especially with regards to room upkeep and the breakfast area, but these weren't a big deal to us. The staff was fine but it seems like they forgot about us after the first day or so. I debated giving this 3 or 4 stars when I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars.

Rooms are clean, staff is very courteous, we opted for the inclusive parking option, (allowed our vehicle to be parked in a secured, undergound parking lot - perfect when traveling with kids). The breakfast program was great. For the hotel being right downtown, the rooms were extremely quiet - considering the traffic/noise etc outside. The rooms are really sound proof. We had the CITY VIEW, and it was certainly worth the extra few bucks. Morning or night we could get a pulse for what was happening outside very quickly. We loved the LOCATION of the hotel, if we went to the west two blocks we had great restaurants, including Hard Rock Cafe, and the Rainforest, ( and BTW there is a SUPER McDonalds was just a block further to the west.) If we ventured to the east 2 blocks we hit the ESPNZone (make sure you get your coupon at explorechicago.org). The Magnificent Mile is less than 3 blocks away to the east, and shops are in abundance. For the price, we paid to have the hotel, parking and cook to order breakfast - we found it to be a GREAT place to stay.

The hotel had a package where we could get our car anytime we wanted without paying for in/out fees each time. Although we didn't need our car during our stay, the extra cost of the room per night ($20/night) with this package was still worth it because it was still cheaper to pay this than to pay for each night to park the car ($44/night). Since having children (ages 2 and 5), we've always stayed in hotels with suites. The suite and hotel were fine - typical of an Embassy Suite. The breakfast was great - hot, ready to eat, and a good selection. The only not so positive reviews I would give is that our room faced the street and so each night we were woken up at least once by sirens in the area.

However, the experience was one of the worst stays we have ever had. We have young children who after a long day of sightseeing would like to take a swim. PLEASE DO NOT GO SWIMMING IN THIER POOL. The first night the pool was noticeably dirty and cloudy. We gave it the benefit of the doubt and returned the next couple nights as well hoping someone would have the time to clean it. Needless to say nobody ever did and after a few minutes of pulling bunches of hair from our baby's mouth and hands we escaped the pool. I thought I would at least put my feet in the hot tub but again the bubbles were filled with gunk and filth. I picked up a few of my kids' water toys from around the edges of the pool area and also noticed that the pool was not the only place that need some attention. The entire rooms perimeter was caked with dirt and crud. There are not enough adjectives to describe this experience. After mentioning this to the manager they proceeded to tell us that they would send an engineer to the pool the next day to \"shock\" the water. I think that is exactly why the area is the way it is. Shocking the water is not going to magically clean up the pool. Someone needs to physically sweep and scrim the water and while they are at it maybe mop the floors.

Happy Hour is really busy and the snacks could be better (maybe some nuts or small appetizers in addition to the chips and crackers) but it's included too so I'm not complaining! There was a wedding reception at the hotel on the Saturday night that we were there and it got a bit loud after midnight but hey, it's their special day; hope they had a great time!! The suite is great; nice and roomy and the beds are soooo comfy. Microwave and fridge and extra sink/mirror in the bedroom area; nice! The only thing that would be nice would be to have free internet access included in the rate. We did use the business center but there are only three computers available to use.

We stayed Friday through Sunday, and the hotel didn't seem too busy at all (relative to the size of the hotel). I beleive the service was sub par for Embassy Suites standards. Checking in took to long, as I had two rooms under the same reservation but the young lady could only find one. She swiped my credit card atleast 20 times, and was slightly unsure how the process worked. When we used the pool on Friday night, is was not busy at all. It was only the four of us, a mother and daughter, and a group of about 10 children all under the age of 12. The children were RUNNING around, screaming, jumping, just pure chaos. This made it very uncomfortable for everyone else in the facility. I am all for children have a great time, but there was no adult supervision at all and that is a safety hazard. We called the Front Desk from the pool area and notfied them of the situaiton, and they told us security would be on the way. However, no security ever showed up, but the\" father\" came into the pool area and said that the staff had called him and said that we thought his kids were out of control. He continued to stare at us and say unpleasant comments to us, and told he kids to continue doing whatever they wanted. First off, the Front Desk should never tell someone that someone else complained on them, and secondly, they should never lie to the guest like they did. They had no intention on calling security and did not care about our time at the pool. The young ladies at the Managers Reception were very friendly and helpful. However, on Saturday night they only had about 20 tables available for guests to sit at while at the reception, and they only offer chip and salsa. Every one was just standing up against walls and sitting on the floors. Not very welcoming. All other Embassy Suites offer much larger sitting accomodations, I beleive this one is falling below standard. Breakfast was great, however due to limited seating and the tables not being cleaned very quickly, it was hard to locate a seat. The older concierge in the evenings wasn't as friendly as the one in the morning/afternoon. So I would recommend that you get all your questions asked early in the day.

Parking was expensive at $44 per night, but that's true of all Chicago hotels (see below). The surprising extra charge was the $9.95 Internet charge per day--per computer, which adds up over a week when you have 2 computers for business. My husband and I both need to work from the computer so we each take a laptop. When he was gone with his computer during the day for business, I had to pay to connect with my laptop. The system recognizes the different computers and charges for each. Many chains provide free wi-fi and don't charge for multiple computers so I was surprised.

You can use the computers in the business center for free (including printing) but you can't work from there all day, obviously. The Italian restaurant at the hotel (Osteria on State) is excellent.

The hotel is brimming with families with children, and the free breakfast buffet is a particular family mob scene. Understandable, because the suite arrangement and perfect location downtown make it the ideal place to stay with children. If I were in town without kids or on business, however, I would run screaming in the other direction. In other words, it's a great place to stay with kids, but if you don't have kids, there are way too many kids! Location is perfect. Just a couple blocks off Michigan, near the Grand train stop, walking distance to Navy Pier, and short drive to Lincoln Park. In and out parking privileges made travel around town a breeze. Biggest pluses were LOCATION, customer service, friendly doormen, great maid service, fun atrium atmosphere, and breakfast. Oh, AND the workout room is great. Not big, but just right for the relative few guests that seem to use it and the cardio equipment is the best I've used in a long time, having visited lots of gyms. Biggest minuses: Chaotic lobby, always packed swimming pool, and crazy loud kids (other than mine, of course).", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haddonfield, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Embassy Suites in Perfect Location\u201d", "Author": "joan3boys", "ReviewID": "UR32974262", "Content": "I too think this Embassy Suites should be in top ten of Chicago Hotels.

Check in was a breeze. Frontline staff very personal and helpful, even our valet parking assistant was great. Our room was ready and it appeared clean in the surface. All's well so far. Out the front door and on to the shopping! Hotels in this area are perfectly located. We returned well into the evening after a great meal believe or not at the California Pizza Kitchen down the road (PF Changs also around the corner). We took stocked of our plans and decided to extend our stay by a day. Again, front staff handled our request with precision and a smile. Went to bed and slept well. Breakfast time!!! I am not at a 5star and don't expect it to be but, why can't the Embassy Suites do something different with their breakfast bar? Don't offer it if you cannot get it right. Worse food I have had in a long time! The place was packed with little ones carrying their dolls (so cute) so it was a bit noisy but that 's okay. They were fun to watch. The omlet was not good. The buffet had cold eggs and bacon and I refused to let my elderly mother eat their cold eggs for fear of bacteria. Coffee cups held maybe a half a cup. Cereal was stale. Thank goodness my mini muffin & fruit were edible. Let's go back to my room for a minute. While I said it was clean, I suggest to Hilton that it is time to change the furniture. The armchair and couch in 622 are badly worn. Isn't this just a cost of doing business, to recover or replace worn furniture? This is the bad. Now for the ugly. Day one I used the main restroom outside of the pool. Filthy! Toilets dirty. Floor had not been mopped in a couple of days or so it seemed. Just get me out and back to the room. Day two, certainly the staff has had time to catch up after a busy Easter weekend full of messy children. I watch the cleaning staff come out of the bathroom with hope. No such luck. Just as bad. Not sure anything had been done! This is the Embassy Suite for crying out loud, not Motel sick! I did register my comments as I am not afraid to speak out for the good and the bad. Come on managment. Don't worry so much about the front fountain and look at what the cleaning team is not up to. And then go eat breakfast in your kitchen. I'll bet you make some quick changes. Sure I will be back because as I said it's good value for $$$. I just wish someone way way up in Embassy Suites would take note and change the food.

We had excellent service from the hotel even before checking in!!! I reviewed the hotel on this site and saw so many wonderful comments, so my girlfriend and I booked a room here. I contacted the Concierge in advance of arrival about possibly getting tickets to Oprah since I was unable to get them in advance of the trip. The Concierge actually returned my call saying there is no guarantee, but that they would surely try to get us tickets once we arrived. That blew me away - I've left messages for Concierges before in other hotels/cities and never received a call back!!! My girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel by taxi and were greeted by Mike, the Bellman. We had lots of bags and were very tired so he was a site for sore eyes! And what a friendly guy! We checked in easily (if you prepay the room, you get a WONDERFUL price so look into that for a steal of a deal!) and received exactly as we requested - upper floor away from the elevator. The hotel has 11 floors and we were put on the 10th floor! The hotel is ATRIUM styled with fountain in the lobby so sound does carry up. It has an open-air feeling to it. Lots of greenery makes it really beautiful! The elevators are fast and there are 4!!!! (I've been in hotels of the same size that had only 2 very slow elevators so this was a real bonus to me!) The Embassy Rooms are so large and roomy compared to other hotels! The flat-screened TV in the living room totally impressed me. But there is also a large TV in the bedroom as well. The beds are VERY comfy! The room was immaculate and having a refrigerator and microwave in the room is nice and convenient. I went to the Concierge desk and talked to Richard, who is so very professional and kind. I asked about Oprah tickets and he explained what their process is. He left a note for the morning Concierge to call the show and request tickets on our behalf. There are no promises but they do make a great effort which is should be acknowledged. The FREE breakfast is amazing! Hot, made to order omelets, pancakes, hash browns, cold cereals, bagels/toast/muffins, fresh fruit, juice, coffee - it's all there. And the cold items are cold as they should be as well as the hot items are hot! The staff clears the tables quickly - leave a little tip on the table for them cause they are very helpful and efficient. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoon, Philip, another Concierge, had left a message saying they requested the tickets from Oprah and would let us know if they heard from them. Philip had gotten the note from Richard and actually FOLLOWED THROUGH! Another WOW! After returning from shopping, Richard was back at the Concierge desk so we stopped to find out if he had heard from Oprah staff yet and he said no. We took the elevator up and by time we got in our room Richard had called and said that the Oprah staff called as soon as we walked away from the desk! We were put on Standby for the next day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early morning taping. We were elated! In one hour we were told that we were upgraded to CONFIRMED! Richard even re-confirmed the time we were supposed to be there - then called us back with specific instructions for when to arrive, when we needed to leave the hotel by, and other necessary guidelines we needed to follow. This was totally a dream come true for me - to be able to see a taping of the Oprah Show! We gave Richard a BIG tip for his help! And also tipped Philip for his help too! During the remaining part of our stay, Richard was also very helpful in guiding us for meals. And Philip gave us info about Late Nite Catechism, which was playing at the Royal George Theater. What a hilarious show this is! Catch it if you can - only $30 at the door. Front desk staff was also very cordial. This hotel rates as FIVE STAR service! It is so very convenient to Magnificent Mile. There is a great grocery store across the street and, of course, a Starbucks on the corner.

It is inconvienent to be able to get change and laundry detergent at the front desk, but they are willing to give you change and let you buy single laundry detergent. I wouldn't recommend using the laundry service they have because the price is per item (ie. your underwear cost 6 dollars a piece to wash).

PROS: Can't beat the location. great restaurants and shopping all around you and only 3 blocks to Magnificent Mile. We easily walked to Millenium Park and Oak Beach (up by the Drake Hotel off of Michigan Avenue) - my kids did fine with the walk. Easy to get taxis in this location as well. Hotel very clean, well organized, fairly consistent housekeeping. they honored all requests that we made. Great made to order breakfast in the morning Extremely comfortable beds - LOVE the beds Awesome and easy for families. CONS: The lobby is unusually and freakishly cold - beware. It is a madhouse at breakfast time between 7 and 9:30. Just be prepared and steel yourself. Pool is small. Completely fine, just small and gets crowded easily. If you don't want to be around kids, this isn't a good hotel for you. The only laundry facilities are on the 11th floor; there is only 1 washer and 2 dryers so be prepared to wait unless you go at an off time. There is street noise. Keep your windows closed at night and perhaps use a noise machine to block out noise. We were on the 6th floor and stayed on the Ontario Street side - it was quite noisy at times.

We stayed in a 2 room suite, we had the get away special for 249.00, which included a free bottle of champagne and strawberries, a $25 gift certificate to the Osteria downstairs, and a 1pm checkout. The strawberries and champagne were not in the room as promised but was resolved within a few hours, the gift certificate was only good in the Osteria, (this was unknown too us) we actually ate in the Pizzeria, we showed the hostess our gift card and she told us it was fine only to find out when the bill came it was only good in the Osteria, so we had no choice but to pay the bill in full, we used the certificate towards the least expensive wine for in the room, which still cost us $15.00 after the gift certificate, with surcharges, tax and %18 gratuity! The fold out sofa bed had no pillows anywhere in the suite, and no blanket! Staff was good and brought pillows, luckily my daughter had brought her own blanket. The phone in the master bedroom was broken, but the one in the living area was fine.

The king size bed was VERY soft and had 6 pillows, which were also VERY nice, it was quiet, but the view was awful, we were in room 1117 on the top floor and faced a very ugly parking garage, I would have preferred to see the goings on in the streets.

Its in the heart of the city, easily accessible to almost anything you could want to do. If you want to go to a baseball game, it's a block away from the Red Line which is how you get to both Wrigley and Commiskey. If it's food you're looking for, it's right across the street from the Webber Grill, right down the street from amazing restaurants like Quartino and Big Bowl and a few blocks from Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due if it's Chicago deep dish pizza you are looking for. However, of course with the location you are going to get a few negatives. It seems everything you have with a normal Embassy Suites was just a little worse. It lacked the little touches. We were there for a long weekend in June, which must be prime tourist season, but there were some negatives. A highlight of all Embassy Suites is the decor inside. While this one did have nice waterfalls running through the hotel, it lacked the huge goldfish that typically fill these pools. The happy hour always had a line, sometimes a very long one. What made this even worse was there was a limit of one drink per person, so everyone you were with had to go up to bar rather than you getting a drink for both yourself and your companion. Seating around the bar quickly filled up and so you could not simply point to the person. Getting a drink meant saving your seat, or worse, if one of you was getting ready, waiting for the other to go down to get a drink. At breakfast there was the same issue. There was a line every morning, and finding seating was actually difficult on some mornings. They include a guide on when breakfast is the busiest in the room. On the last day we were there it took 10 minutes to get an elevator from the 2nd floor up to our room. Then, when we were leaving it took another 10 to get an elevator back down, and we subsequently stopped at every floor. However, almost all of these are the result of the hotel being in such a great location. And you get what you traditionally get with an Embassy Suites: giant rooms and very good service.

The room we requested, a suite with two double beds, was sold out so they gave us a room with a king instead, knocking off $100/night. Ok, that was nice! The room itself was satisfactory. It was a litlle stuffy and the airconditioner didn't seem to work that well. I found the bed hard and very uncomfortable, and the sheets were really, really scratchy. The plasma t.v. was a hit with the kids, though. Several times I tried to call the front desk or guest services for additional pillows and blankets, and no one answered. When I got through, I was told they didn't have any extra pillows. The breakfast was ok, although we've had better at a Country Inn & Suites. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, some yogurt and bakery goods. Made to order omlets are also available, but we didn't have any. On the weekend, there can be a lot of traffic for breakfast, but the management did a great job of keeping everything moving. There is also a Starbucks in the building. The concierge was knowledgable about the subway and gave us great directions to the red line, which is a short walk away. We walked almost everywhere, except to the Cubs game.

I pricelined a room for Saturday night only and won the Embassy Suites Downtown. It was a slightly interesting experience. I had thought all Embassy Suites' rooms were two bedroom suites. Apparently one room on each floor is listed a \"King Parlor Suite\"--that means that the firestairwell is where the living room would normally be and you just a long hallway to the bedroom in back. I was changing hotels midway and called ahead to ask if I could check in early. They said they had a King Parlor Suite available if I wanted that. It was fine as I was there only one night, bur I was a little surprised when I walked into the room and found it was only one room. The bathroom was also small with only a standup shower stall rather than a bathtub. The toiletries were actually very nice (herb scented) and nice than those provided at the Westin I had stayed at the night before. The room was very clean and well kept and the bedding of high quality, but having stayed at the Westin the night before, it was obviously of a lower star quality with laminated particle board type furniture. That said, it is a solid three star hotel--clean and well kept.. There were one or two weddings going on that night and the noise from the atrium was noticably audible in the room well after midnight. It might be better in the two room suites where you could close the door to the bedroom. Valet parking is conviently located right under the hotel--I think around 37 dollars per night. The parking guys did not lift a finger to help me with getting luggage into or out of my car--maybe it's not their job.

There is a grocery store right across the street and plenty of restaurants within easy (and very safe) walking distance. The grocery even has a good deli counter with hot food. If going to Navy Pier, the free trolley is fine, but not as frequent as the bus (a bargain at $2 per adult and older child). Someone told me their family took a cab - $10, including tip. The Chicago Childrens Museum is really loads of fun - check your local museum for reciprocal membership privelages. I will definitely try to stay here on any return trip, especially at a great rate.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TN", "Title": "\u201cnice, but i overpaid\u201d", "Author": "bamcrewmom", "ReviewID": "UR6505337", "Content": "Booked in mid nov at the embassy web site and got an internet rate of $249. Thought it was a deal, until I checked again a week before i left and see I could have saved about $75 a night. Do not ever book any internet rate. Booked $249 for a king, asked if they could accomdate a double when I got there, they said no, since I had a pre-paid room. Almost $1000.00. Sad thing was the hotel was only half booked and I could have had a double if they really wanted to give me one, and I am a Hilton Member too.

The location is fantastic, with no need to rent a car if you can make it to the hotel without one (take the airport shuttle or taxi). Everything is in walking distance, great restaurants close by, and in a safe area. The front desk managed to find a free King suite upon my request at check in, since I had been reserved a double by mistake. Rooms kept clean, the bed was very comfortable, absolutely no problems with the room. The extra value is in the daily breakfast and manager's reception. Even if the line seems long at breakfast, it moves quickly, and there are always tables available by the time you need one. The nightly happy hour is a nice change from the 12 dollar drinks you will pay at area restaurants, so take advantage of it if you're so inclined. Not premium brands, but hey, it's free. It was also very nice to be greeted upon returning from to the hotel each evening with a friendly, \"Welcome Home!\" by the porter. They seem to make an effort to be friendly and warm.

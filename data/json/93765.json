We normally stay next door at The Flamingo Motel where we can get an ocean-facing room about a 1/4-block from the ocean for about $179.00. But we booked late and nothing was available so we opted for The Rodeway Inn. We did get a true ocean-front room, 2nd floor, but at a cost of $244.00 for Friday and Saturday nights ($210 for Sunday night), The Good: The two gentlemen at the front desk were pleasant enough and congenial. Although rough around the edges and a little crusty, Diane cleaned our rooms each day and did an adequate job. What we appreciated was her asking when we wanted it done and she made every effort to have it done for us. We were on the 2nd floor so could walk up/down after moving in so we could avoid the elevator. Ocean front room gave good views of the beach. In-room safe. Changing room and use of pools and parking lot before/after check in/out. The Bad There is only a single [slow] elevator servicing the entire ocean front hotel (thank goodness we were on the 2nd floor and could walk up/down staircase). The indoor pool was closed most of Sunday with no explanation given. The check in/out changing room was the bathroom in the indoor pool; my wife walked in, then immediately walked out because of the filth in and around the commode and lots of something smashed into the hard rubber mats on the floor. Granted, it was a Saturday on a holiday weekend but the parking lot full and we had search parking off-site and found it 2 blocks away. Felt defensive each day that housekeeping would ask if we \"wanted service?\" I thought cleaning the bathrooms, emptying trash, and making beds was part of the $244.00 I was paying for, not an option? Balcony had only a partial thin wooden barrier blocking neighbors, who could easily hop over the side railing or crawl under the barrier to gain access to our balcony. Although there was in in-room safe (thank goodness), the sliding patio door would not lock or even latch due to the entire handle being bent and loose; the sliding door was installed on the outside so unable to insert a bar to prevent opening; we were lucky no one realized they could hop onto our balcony as they could have walked right into our room and taken whatever they wanted. The Flamingo is no Hilton, but for $75.00 less per night, we will probably book earlier and stay there next time. Ocean front was nice, but not that nice at this hotel. .", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201croom actually updated a bit\u201d", "Author": "ssiegel", "ReviewID": "UR139270612", "Content": "I just returned from a 3 night stay and I'm happy to report that, since my last review, the rooms have been a bit updated.

I'm not a big beach fan, but my family is. We were right on the beach, which was good for them, but only a couple of minutes walk away from the end of the boardwalk, which was good for me. The end of the boardwalk doesn't have much though (only a handful of stores and an ice cream shop). We could walk to a bunch of restaurants and mini golf places. The free breakfast was decent, but you have to walk across the parking lot to the main office building (and where I think other rooms are located??) to get it.

It was so nice to park your car and leave it there for a few days, as it is walking distance from many things. However, at the rodeway, nothing seemed to work correctly from the start. We booked an oceanfront room online, only to be told upon arrival that our room wasn't available, due to an issue with our credit card (not my fault...just a technical glitch). I had received no email or any other notification of the problem. The manager was quite rude about it, but at least there was another room available. So we ended up with a room in the motel building, but the bright side was the cheaper rate. The elevator is dirty and a little scary. The building is in serious need of upgrade. Cleaning is shoddy at best. We received a 6am wakeup call that we did not request! On the 2nd day of our stay, both of our key cards mysteriously stopped working. When I took them to the desk, I was told it was probably my fault, because I surely kept them next to a cellphone or credit card. As it turned out, the batteries in the sensor had died, which they did replace promply. The air conditioner was on its last legs and was caked with dust or some mystery substance...it did not keep the room very cool. We had a lot of difficulty getting & maintaining a wifi connection.

We experienced nothing but probelms right from the moment of check in. When we booked, we booked with a card that had since expired and been replaced. This had automatically cancelled our reservation, but we were not informed of this by email or phone. When we finished our six-hour drive to OC, we were told that the oceanfront room we had reserved had been given away and that the only vacancy they had was the streetside motel. We were really looking forward to an oceanfront room and instead were stuck with a commanding view of a concrete parking lot. We took that room, and the manager was completely unopologetic. His response was, and I quote, \"well, you're supposed to use a good credit card\". Yeah, thanks, buddy. The following morning, I went down to get some \"breakfast\", which turned out to be prepackaged bagels and generic instant oatmeal. When I got back to my room, I noticed that my key had fallen out of my pocket, and went searching back down the stairs for it until I reached the lobby. The young ladies at the table I was sitting at told me that they found it and turned it into the desk. I went to the desk and asked if I could have another key made, and the receptionist barked that since the room wasn't in my name, I could not have one made. Fair enough, I totally understand that security policy, but I then asked her if any keys had been turned in to get my old one back, and she said point blank \"no\". Now, keep in mind that this was after the people at the table I was sitting in told me they had turned it in. Ergo, she had my key and was saying she didn't...correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that called lying?

I was able to get the oceanfront room during Senior Week and the OC Air Show for just $99! The room was clean and the bathroom was nicely stocked with soft, fresh linens. The beds were clean, the bedding was not something you'd find in a Hampton Inn or comparable hotel, but they were at least average. I stay in hotels an average of twice a week for work and have seen a wide range of hotel rooms. I would rate the staff a perfect 10, the rooms a 7, and the location/value a 10.

My family was looking for a change of pace/scenery from the Jersey Shore we had frequented since we were kids. We originally found it by calling all the Ocean Front hotels up and down the beach. The Rodeway Inn had the best prices by far so we gave it a shot. The first year (2006) my family (me, husband and 2 children-6 and 2 at the time) and my parents went and had adjoining rooms-which was great for the kids to spend time with them. The last 2 years my brother's family (consisting of his wife and 3 kids-now 8, 4 and 4 months) joined us as well. We all feel we could not have made a better choice!! The rooms are clean and big-2 double beds and then a fold out couch-with a partition between them. There is a small table and chairs and a coffee table and a TV armoire and dresser w/ mirror. There is a small kitchen area with a little fridge, sink and microwave-also a little coffee maker. There is an area to hang clothes with a safe also. The bathroom is spacious with a tub shower and a large vanity/counter area. The first 2 years we were able to have the couch opened up and also had a crib (the hotel provided) set up in the room all at once and were still able to easily move around once adjusting the table/chairs and coffee table. The absolute BEST feature is the veranda. What an amazing view of the ocean-which is just steps away. They have chairs and a small table out there and there is plenty of space to have a few people sit comfortably. If you have the adjoining rooms-the verandas have a partial half wall so you can chat out there yet they are private enough if you don't know your neighbors also. Every night I'm there, after the kids are in bed, I sit outside and read a book and enjoy the ocean breeze and watch the people strolling the beach in the moonlight. Aside from one dragonfly this year-I have never had any issues with bugs at all while out there either-a BIG difference from Jersey! The outdoor pool is directly down below and just beyond that is the short path through the dunes onto the beach. The beaches are clean and safe-they have umbrella rentals ($15/day) and chair rentals available on the beach and there are also some people that walk around and ask to take pictures of your family or kids (there is a fee only if you buy them). When you return from the beach you can rinse your feet (and beach toys if you have kids) right as you walk off the beach as the hotel has a little shower at the edge of the pool. There is also an indoor pool with windows all around making it light and bright and great for after the beach or for a rainy day or late night swim (it's open until 10pm) There are also bathrooms and changing rooms in there-a great plus when you are at the beach and need a quick place to go! The staff is great-very friendly and helpful! Check in and out is always quick and they are great at accomodating requests (our 3 rooms are always right next to each other). The continental breakfast isn't glamorous but it works well for mornings when you just want to get out to the beach first thing. They added bagels this year which was a nice treat for something different. The other choices are Sara Lee packaged muffins and danishes-not bad at all. Coffee is available all day. Also there is a soda machine outside the lobby. There is lots of parking available and unless you get back really late at night you can usually get a spot right near the entrance. Even if not-it's a short walk-and the elevator is right near the entrance also. There are also entrances on both sides of the building (in addition to the center one) and one has a ramp for luggage carts or strollers. Location is great-one short block from the Jolly Roger Amusement Park, Go Karts and the Water Park. You can walk to several kinds of restaurants including 2 crab houses, an Italian place, McDonalds, Tommy's Sub Shop, and many others. The boardwalk is about a 5 minute drive down the road and parking in the municipal lot is easy and cheap and gives you a very short walk across the street to the rides and arcades. It's not fancy or first class-but it's perfect for an affordable convenient laid back family vacation! This year over the course of 5 days-my son didn't take out his Nintendo DS once-now THAT is saying something :) We can't wait until next year's trip to Ocean City and our stay at the Rodeway Inn!!", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bel Air, MD", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what I expected...\u201d", "Author": "Stacey6574", "ReviewID": "UR19105773", "Content": "I had been looking over the internet for weeks trying to find an oceanfront hotel that had reasonable prices and good reviews. I came across this one and at least got the good reviews. The prices I found online turned out to be higher than when I called the hotel itself and I ended up paying about $300/night. For that price I expected much better. The staff was excellent! I had to call twice, once for the original reservation and again to change days. Both times the man who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. When we arrived too early for checkin the man at the front desk was friendly and quick to preregister us. He also welcomed us to use the changing rooms at the indoor pool, use either of the pools or just spend a few hours on the beach until our room was ready and we could pick up our key. We had an upper floor balcony reserved, but had to switch our days and ended up with 1st floor oceanfront. The view was OK, you can see the ocean but not the beach and the outdoor pool is right in front of you. It was convenient to be able to let the kids swim while we were getting ready in the room and still be able to watch them. Both pools were great with plenty of cushioned lounge chairs to go around. The indoor pool is surrounded by sliding glass doors which were open. It's bright and breezy in there and no overwhelming chlorine smell. The room itself had an unusual odor the moment you step through the door. There was also an odor on the patio coming from the A/C unit. It should be known though, that I've been accused of having a \"bionic nose\" and being a little sensitive to smell. That being said, neither odor was so persistent that I even bothered to notify the front desk. The carpeting seemed either new or very well cared for. It was soft and comfy, not even a little sticky like you sometimes get at the beach. The room had 2 double beds, a pull out love seat, and a kitchenette. The beds were a bit small to me, I'm used to a king size, but they weren't too uncomfortable. The sheets on both beds were stained but seemed clean. There were extra pillows already in the room. The loveseat was clearly dirty and stained, we never opened it, didn't even want to see the inside. The kitchenette had a nice fridge, microwave, coffee pot, toaster dishes, and glasses. It was really nice. This was the first time we stayed somewhere off the boardwalk. It's only about 2 blocks to the boardwalk, but we like to go back and forth from the beach to the boardwalk pretty frequently for food, drinks or just walk around. I expected more for my money and for that reason would probably not stay here again. We have decided to go back to staying on the boardwalk and for that reason will definitley not stay here again.

I scanned the Internet hotel sites and collected the addresses or Googled the hotels and told them what offers were on the sites and what other hotels were willing to take. Rodeway Inn gave me the best deal plus we used my girlfriends AAA discount card for additional savings. It was worth the extra two hours of mapping and calling. Every hotel I contacted was more than happy to undercut any competition. We stayed only two nights to top off our great vacation. I didn't book this hotel expecting a four star classy hotel. I wanted a clean room with one queen bed and a short walk to everywhere. Hotel Overview: Room: Yes, the motel on the street side is old and getting worn out, however, it was very clean. Our room greeted us with cold air, clean carpets, bright bathroom, fresh linens, microwave, and refrigerator. The walls were a bit thin, however we did not have any difficulty sleeping. The only negative about our room was the sliding glass door. We got locked out of the room. I asked a passer-by on the sidewalk to get somebody at the desk to get us back in our room. Although that was a negative, it was such a minor set back. The motel is old and the lock needed some WD-40. The janitor was up to our room in a jiffy and we were back inside. Staff: The staff is very friendly. We arrived early and had to wait about an hour for our room, but we were handed our key cards. We manged to plug up the toilet the first few minutes we were there (don't flush a lot of paper) and the janitor was at our door as soon as we called for a plunger. That is good service. The maids did a great job cleaning, the front desk staff provided us with courteous service. Location / Ammenities: We were a few blocks north of the boardwalk, but only a few steps from the trolley that only costs $2 to ride all day. The beach is only a few yards from the room. I didn't use the indoor pool because it was full of kids, but we used the outdoor pool. Nothing fancy, but it was clean. I was hoping for a hot tub, but there isn't one. The parking lot is large and easy to get around. I have a small car, but everybody else has an SUV and I didn't see any dents on them. Free Wi-Fi was in the lobby. I didn't bring my laptop - I was on vacation! The balconies in the building I stayed in were not very private, but nobody bugged us. There is an amusement park across the main drag. We played some Jungle Golf, but there was a lot more for kids and families. The motel offers a small breakfast buffet. Juices, tea, coffee, pre-packaged Sara Lee muffins, and pre-packaged danish. Actually it was very good. I like to get my OJ in the morning - and they had a huge supply of it. Final Thought: I'm not sure when we are going to OCMD again, but I would stay at this hotel again. I would prefer to stay at the ocean front building, but that is a lot more money for the pleasure of looking at the ocean. Thanks Rodeway Inn, we had a nice stay. Don't forget to go to English's breakfast and/or dinner buffet on 15th Street. Very, very good. Call and check prices before you and yours go out for dinner.

The rooms were very small we had a queen and a balcony in the rodeside building...sitting on our balcony we could see the ocean. Two buildings over you can catch the boardwalk tram and 7/11 is across the street along with a liquor store and bar/restaurant that was great. The pools at the hotel were great and so was the beach. Everything was clean. A little sandy some places but it is to be expected. We will probably try a closer hotel to the boardwalk next time. The tram is expensive and slow. If you dont mind this hotel is perfect the tram is close.", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood location, great frontdesk staff\u201d", "Author": "mdgipsy", "ReviewID": "UR3810252", "Content": "We stayed in the street front building which was actually quieter than I expected and had no problem with noise.

We stayed there from Aug. 6 to Aug 13th. We have 2 teens and a 21 yr old daughter. We arrived early at the Rodeway Inn and found the front desk to be very accomodating. We went out to eat and by the time we were done our room was ready about 2 hrs. early. The room was very comfortable for the 5 of us. We had comfortable beds and more than enough towels and anything else we asked for. The indoor pool was beautiful as was the outdoor pool.....some of the hotels in the area had very small pools and this hotel has large ones. We stayed on the second floor oceanfront. This room had a great view of the ocean. If you want to see the ocean make sure you stay on the second floor or above. The first floor has the dunes blocking the way. It took us only a couple minutes to get to the beach which we could see from the room. The location was perfect and we sat on the balcony every morning and had coffee watching the surfers in the ocean and also the dolphins playing in the waves. It was so relaxing.The room was non smoking and smelled very nice. We did have a small problem with the pull out sofa, my son slept on that and he sometimes had difficulty getting it open. But he always managed and never complained. At night the room was very quiet. The A/C helped with the noise level and kept the room very cool. The only drawback was the continental breakfast...it consisted of mini muffins, mini bagals, small danishes and coffee and juice. Not bad just limited in protein choices. Yes we will go back to this hotel when we come back to Ocean City. It was an easy walk to the boardwalk and far enough away to avoid the crouds. We ate at the Angler and enjoyed the free cruise after dinner...very nice. We ate at Coins for lunch one day and had a great meal. It was nice to have a microwave and fridge in the room as my teens loved to eat lunch after being on the beach or at the pool. All in all a great family stay. Would do it again and will stay at this hotel.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitmore Lake, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery accomodating, friendly front desk\u201d", "Author": "reinekim1", "ReviewID": "UR3674141", "Content": "We just got back into town today after a 3 day vacation at the Rodeway Inn, Ocean City, Md. The front desk attendants couldn't possibly have been more helpful and accommodating. When we got there, we were assigned to room 119, bottom floor facing the main street. I asked the front desk lady whether it was possible to be moved to the second floor, since we liked the look of having a balcony. She searched the computer, and found that a room on the second floor was coming available the next morning, and we could have that. Room 119 had plenty of space for us (there were 3 of us, my husband, myself, and 11 year old son). The only complaint I had with the room was that we could hear the road noise at night. And it could get loud. Next day they transferred us to room 215. The room was hot when we opened the door, so we cranked up the A/C and went to the beach for a couple hours. There was no improvement when we got back to our room. My husband took the little A/C unit apart and cleaned it in the tub. It was so filthy and clogged. We figured it would work now. No. I called the front desk and told them what was happening with our A/C. He called me back in about 5 minutes and said that they would move us to the front building, overlooking the ocean, to room 404. That was the last thing we expected! We spent about $170 a night for our room in the one building, knowing we didn't have the extra money for the oceanview. That room was magnificent! Oh my God. We were in heaven. So, I guess as far as I'm concerned, the front desk went above and beyond making our stay right for us. Now, as far as the restaurants go....against my better judgement we went to Paul Revere smorgasbord for dinner one night. It was awful. Really. The food looked like it had been sitting in the pans for a good while. There were things on that buffet that I didn't recognize! The turkey and roast beef were chewy. We spit it out into our napkins...it was that bad. Next day we still had heartburn. Yick. We went to Jonah the Whale for seafood buffet one night. That was ok. It was like $27 for the buffet. Good tasting. We went to Hall's on 60th street for their breakfast buffet. Well worth the drive! It was the best buffet we'd seen. I would love to go back to Ocean City again, but I think we'll stay somewhere in the \"teen\" streets. It was a very long walk to the boardwalk shops from 29th street. All in all, we had a wonderful time.", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Rodeway Inn Oceanfront", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d93765-Reviews-Rodeway_Inn_Oceanfront-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "$60 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2910 Baltimore Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "93765", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7a/ae/7aae7a5407ec6dee29436cd46bf36b2e4large.jpg"}}

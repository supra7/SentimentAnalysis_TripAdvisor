{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Location, cruddy room No lobby, small, crowded office. Employees were pretty nice, helpful. The location was great - in the quiet residential section of the quarter. We had to schlup our stuff up stairs onto a rickety, interior balcony - Our stark room did have adequate closet space, the beds were comfy - no headboards though. Furnished in old junky furniture - the bathroom was spartan as well but the shower did have good water pressure and I almost scalded myself, so be careful about the hot water! We enjoyed missing/broken window panes, so clean, fresh air kept the room well-ventilated. Paid too much because at least two big conventions were in town. Continental breakfast was below average - a few hard croissants and rolls and small styrofoam cups for the coffee.

Well...after reading the reviews I understand the extremes. It IS in a good location-3 blocks from Burbon Street-but on the north side of the French Quarter-keeps it cheap but some walking to get south of Burbon. Some rooms are big (ours was a large 2 bedroom suite) some are really small (I saw one getting cleaned that could barely fit a bed!). The front desk was hit or miss...either super helpful or clueless. Housekeeping did not show the first day but did the second but not the third. For what we paid in a room that fit 6 people easily we were happy. We had a semi-private entrance, a balcony and a fridge and microwave. BUT I felt more like we were staying at a friends house than at a hotel or bed and breakfast. Or a nice hostel. The decor is rather threadbare but we felt safe and the linens were clean even if the floors were not. Bring extra socks or slippers for the dirty floors (tile), bring shampoo and conditioner, bring a hairdryer and bring earplugs due to the old window unit air conditioners being loud.

It was a few blocks up from Bourbon Street, but the noise and the smell were undetectable ;).I had booked us a double room - just one double bed, because it was much cheaper. Much to my surprise, our room not only had a king size bed, but a sitting room as well! It was huge (I'd estimate nearly 600 square feet)! My husband and I are pretty laid back about a hotel if it is on the cheaper end, but there were some things to take note of if high quality is a priority of yours. They did not change our sheets everyday, but changed our towels. The floors were tile, not carpeted, and there were no rugs, so I wore my socks all the time in the room (which became quite dirty on the bottom). We had trouble every time we tried to lock and unlock our door because it was a traditional key lock and I believe the lock was old.

We are a family of four that stayed a Sunday night upon returning from a cruise.Not your typical hotel experience as this place was obviously a traditional 1800 quarter home or series of homes. Once you check-in, they lead you to the outside door that leads to your group of rooms (some up, some down). Staff was friendly, and was able to let us check in around 12n so that we could store our numerous bags in the room. The lobby was a very small secure space where they check you in/out, set out pastries/coffee, and allow people to store bags (if there is space).Our room was fairly basic with two queen sized beds, a couple of closets, and a basic motel style bathroom. It was not a balcony room, so our windows actually faced out toward a small courtyard (nothing spectacular, but very traditional). The room included a wall a/c unit (worked fine, although we just used the ceiling fan), a basic phone (we didn't try it), and a flat screen TV (worked fine). You actually get a real set of keys, so don't loose them.The location was great. Very convenient to the heart of the quarter and Jackson Square.

When I read the trip advisor reviews for this hotel, I was mentally prepared for a gamble. I've visited New Orleans for 25 years, so I never expect perfection in buildings that were built in the 1800's. It was the complaints about human error and lack of concern that had me on alert and ready with a plan B.I travelled with a group of friends, so did not book through the normal reservation system I've used in the past. This was their trip and they kindly invited me along.We arrived at St. Peter House Hotel at 10 a.m. after a 12 plus hour road trip. I know that technical check-in is at 3 p.m. I'm always prepared for that, but have never really had to wait. We did wait for our room until a few minutes before 3. Occupying myself until then didn't bother me, but I do wish I had brought an easy access bag with a few things for freshening up. I didn't plan on wearing the coke-stained dress from the road trip all day....When we checked into room 21, everyone was pleased. It was spacious and *clean*. Having seen 4 females check into this room, a very gracious housekeeping lady brought a huge stash of extra towels, washcloths, and soaps. She did this each day we were there. We never had to ask her for anything.There were 3 window unit air conditioners in this apt. Temp control was easy. The balcony outside the window was spacious, shaded, and very accommodating.This room had a small refrigerator which is always great for stashing the second half of a po-boy.If I had gone to a 4 or 5 star hotel, I would have expected plush, clean carpet. Carpet gets dirty, period. Since I didn't sleep on the floor, this didn't bother me. I didn't wear white socks, so I can't tell you about a how dirty they might have gotten. My point: we paid a low rate for this room and the carpet was the only thing that wasn't clean. All other surfaces were spotless.I would have preferred that the dead bolt worked on the door, but it didn't. All other locks on the windows and doors were fine.We didn't encounter any rudeness at the desk or anywhere, for that matter. Of course, we weren't rude to them, either.I felt that a fair, neutral report was due. If you are high maintanence, this hotel is not for you.

A lot of street noise at night, either from St Peters St or Dauphine. Overall appearance: a little shabby behind the ears; could do with some renovation.

No heating system -- temperature dropped to low 40s at night during my stay. Thin comforter. Quality of bathroom: About as large as the bedroom itself, maybe a tad larger.

The restraint/bar is under a major renovation. I got a behind the scenes peak at the construction and it looks like it will be fantastic. This is a great location for shopping. Its one block off of Newbury Street. The room was nice and recently renovated. All stone bathroom with large shower. Only neg on the shower there were no shelves in it, no where to put shower toiletries except on the floor of the shower.... very minor point but if someone from the hotel reads this...

Improved: * Internet is much better this time around fast and stable wifi! * General freshness and comfort of room much improved * Quality of tech stuff in room great Sill not great: * They have done nothing about the windows of he hotel. And as its located in a busy intersection o town in can, and will most likely be, super noisy! So if you have problems with noise make sure to get a room facing inwards! * Cold... Although I do believe that they have vastly improved their AC system as well Things to think about when booking: * The bathrooms all seem a little bit different. Som with bathtubs and sep. shower.

The downside is the hallways smell like paint, work is going on in very near proximity to rooms that are being used. The business \"center\" is open to the lobby so no privacy or real quiet. The Oak room is closed, but the St. James is a nice substitute. Drinks are expensive and short, for the price one expects a better pour.

They then moved us to another room and said it had a fireplace and was better - but it was again a room with a King bed and no fireplace. Finally got a room with 2 queens and a fireplace - but this was no better than a regular fairmont room. The fireplace didn't work, the room faced Copley square but the window was beside a bed. The bathroom was small and it had two walk-in closets?? Also there was no coffee machine or kettle. To make it worse, it smelt like a smoking room. But we were tired and didn't want to move again.

At arrival bellhops were at the ready to assist guests and made for a smooth transition from taxi to room. Oak Room was a real old fashioned American bar with fantastic service. Silky smooth cocktails and a vibrent (and quite young) atmosphere.

The mattresses were very firm, no pillow top, and I really missed having a full length mirror. However, the room did overlook Copley square with it's beautiful Christmas tree and picturesque church. OK, so the hotel halls and our room appeared a bit stark, dingy even, but The Fairmont still held on to its former elegance with the room's chandelier dressed in shining crystal drops, high ceilings, the hotel's attentive doormen, and a wonderful cheery staff. Catie, the Fairmont mascot black lab retriever, graced the lobby with her large wagging tail, delighting children and guests with her presence. The lobby was festive with lights, garlands and a tree! The Oak Room wait staff were professional, friendly and caring in this very busy time but alas, we were too late making reservations for dinner Christmas Eve and had to go elsewhere. We did eat a pub dinner on Christmas Day in the Oak Room lounge (Kobe beef burger and fries!) which was perfect after the past two nights more formal dining.

I was fortunate enough to get a travel agent rate, so I don;t have much to say about price. We were in a superior room which was very spacious and classic. The bathroom was huge and we were supplied with nice amenities. We especially liked the bathrobes. Upon my boyfriend's first shower in the room, we noticed that the tub was not draining well. We meant to tell the front desk about it before we left for the day, but we forgot. When we came back we met a maintance man outside our door with tools. Apparently the maid had told him about the clog and he came to fix it right away. He was working for about 10 minutes, and then left saying everything was fixed. However, the water still wouldn't go down. We were about to call the front desk when a 2nd maintance man knocked on the door just to see how the shower was. We told him it was still clogged and he fixed it fine. I was very impressed by this service, as we did not even need to notify anyone and they still did a follow up check after the first repair. The surrounding area is really great. We were only about a 5 block walk from the Prudential Center where the Ducktour starts and there are many great restaurants. We ate out every meal and usually brought it back to the room to just relax and watch some TV. The Oak Room looked gorgeous, but it was also expensive. We are pretty low key and it seemed a bit to stuffy for us, but there were always lots of well-dressed people looking quite satisfied in there whenever we walked by, so it must have been good. The hotel lobby is GORGEOUS. Very ornate with a real classic luxury feel. It reminded me very much of NYC's Plaza hotel, which is the sister to the Copley Plaza. The staff was courteous and helpful. A block away from the hotel is Boylston street, loaded with great eateries and shopping. The hotel is in a great location for walking and transit. There was even a Boston Sports Club about a block and a half away. My bf and I are both members of NYSC and could use the facility for no charge. Just know that in December a new area will open up on the upper floor with a huge fitness center and new rooms. Overall, this was an excellent stay. I would definitely stay here again. I recommend avoiding the valet service at the hotel ($42/day with unlimited in-and-out service).

Each conversation he took the time to answer all my questions, offering suggestions and trip ideas. Mr. Buckley proved to be a great resource, knowledgable about his city and site. These phone calls left me feeling so welcome, that I was eagerly anticipating my visit. Upon arrival at Logan Int'l, we were graciously met with a gift as Mr. Buckley remembered it was a special occassion for us. He even recalled my favorite boutique (as was mentioned in a passing phone conversation); and set up a surprise shopping excursion at \"White House/Black Market\" exclusively for me, with my own personal attendant. A few days later while enjoying this luxury; Jason even stopped by to ensure that I was being well looked after. Wow! What attention to detail, what amazing service!!! My husband and I are avid travellers, vacationing a minimum of four times annually and four star establishments are our priority.

When I awoke, no key and I had to call again. They said a key would not fit under the door. Good enough explanation, but one I received the key I found it could easily slide under the door. Second at checkout I had one room service charge that was mine and another that was not. I think the card snafu and false charge are related.

I have stayed at Fairmont properties in the past and had a very positive experience. My experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was very disappointing and has impacted my future choices to stay at a Fairmont property. I do not recommend staying at this property. Overall, the hotel appears to be very luxurious. The lobby, main floor hallways, and ballrooms are gorgeous. However, the standard rooms are not a reflexion of the luxury seen on the main floor of the hotel. The rooms are very small and mediocre at best. We had the following problems with our room: 1. Hotel safe didn't work. 2. In room temperature control did not work. 3. Light bulbs in both the bedside lamp and hanging chandelier were burnt out. 4. TV didn't work. The cables were loose and we fixed it ourselves. 5. The hot water in the shower took a long time to heat up. 6. The drainage in the shower was blocked, leaving a pool of water up to our ankles when we showered. We called the reception for help with the safe as we wanted to leave our valuables in the safe before going out for the day. We waited 45 minutes, as security tried to fix it and finally could not fix it in a timely way. Overall, we felt that they don't maintain the rooms to the standard that is expected from a Fairmont hotel. In addition, the breakfast menu was misleading. We ordered a pastry basket for $14. It indicated that there would be a croissant, two muffins and a danish. Based on the description, we expected a full size croissant and danish. The reality was that the pastries were miniature size. It was VERY misleading and EXTREMELY overpriced for what we received. Thank goodness that Boston is such an amazing city!

Although I saw the smaller rooms were less comfortable I still have a pretty good opinion of the Fairmont. I do like history and classic furnishings, as well, and this hotel has both in abundance. I can see how some people may not like the old rooms though. The hotel is definitely classier than the neigboring Sheraton, where I also stayed; at least someone at the Fairmont always picked up the phone, unlike at the Sheraton. My only gripes are that 1) on arriving back at the hotel after 11pm, we tried to unload the car and find a bellman/ valet to help, but no service staff were in sight.

Ordered room service and it came up promptly and hit the spot. We ordered extra towels and said we would be leaving the room and to leave them on the bed. No one delivered them.

This romantic experience kind of stopped for us at the first floor. Now it is an older hotel, designed by the same architect of the famed Plaza Hotel in New York (also a Fairmont property,) but our room was no where on the same level as the Plaza. First off it was small. I can live with small, but our friends were down the hall, with the exact same rate, booked at the same time, and their room was at least twice the size as ours! Secondly our room had a queen sized bed and theirs had a king. Not a big deal, but it would certainly require one to specify what type of room they were seeking if it mattered to them. The bathroom was also small, with a tub-shower combo, but the shower curtain only covered 2/3rds of the shower area. There is a big hole. If you are seeking privacy while you bathe...you'll have to ask for it from your partner since the curtain does not hide the space you are in. This all being said, we'd certainly stay here again, we'd just be more specific about the room. We ate in the hotel and the food was fine. The bar area was beautiful with a good crowd each night and the hostess and staff were all friendly and prompt. You have read the fitness room is not up to par for a hotel at the level of a Fairmont and the spa is nonexistant. My wife went to the GretaCole Spa in the hotel right next door and very much enjoyed her massage.

To my pleasant surprise, when I returned from my business meetings the next day, there was a bottle of vodka in my room for me.

As with most older hotels, the rooms are small. Ours was clean, a little worn but nicely appointed. It would have been the perfect size for someone travelling alone. The hotel gets very high marks for the things that I care about in a room - great bed, good water pressure in the shower, extremely courteous and helpful staff. On the \"needs improvement\" side, the air conditioning was almost nonexistant. I realize that it must be a nightmare to retrofit a building built in the 20's with A/C, but when it's 90 degrees and high humidity it gets pretty uncomfortable when it takes 8 hours for your room to go from 75 to 65. My biggest complaint, though, is the price. I'm not singling out the Fairmont on this. Any hotel in Boston is expensive. Even with the special internet bargain rate that I was able to get, this place was still pricey. Parking is extra, and you pay for internet (a pet peeve of mine.)

This room at least smelled like they put some type of fabric softener sheet in the vent.

I'm NOT kidding. The tissue box cover was metal and sat atop the back of the toilet, which was slanted toward the bowl. So, you guessed it, the tissue box was forever falling on the toilet lid. There's no place to put your toiletries, no counter at all. The closet was so small, the two of us could not get all our clothes in it for a four day trip. Not much drawer space either.

Asked for a particular wine and prodded by him to just give him the number. Comes back three minutes later, thrusts the wine list back at me and says pick another. No explanation. On to the meal.

The Fairmont was a great place to stay. It is centrally located, near the T, restaurants, shopping. The hotel has an old world charm. The lobby was amazing. The staff that checks you were efficient. We were early, so the bell captain held our luggage, while we explored the town. True the bathrooms are on the smaller size, but the room itself was first rate. We had requested a room with 2 double beds, but they were sold out that weekend. They brought in a roll away bed for us. The room (#144) we were given had a separate bedroom and living room. The fitness center is on the small side, but has everything you need. There is a larger gym close by, but it requires and additional fee. Our room had a view of the roof and air conditioner/heating unit, but we were not in the room except to sleep. The room is quiet and you do not hear any street noise. There are several Starbucks near by. Wi-Fi costs about $15/day, but you can avoid the charges by joining the President's Club (it's free). They have a business center that I did not use...there is a Kinko's around the corner. The bar downstairs is really old school. Please note that the hotel is currently undergoing a major renovation, however, that may work in your favor...room rates that typically run $350 or more, can be had for a much lower price. There is a wonderful laborador in the lobby, \"Catie\", that is available for walks and play. She is very friendly and was a former guide dog.

BUT service leaves a lot to be desired (especially the staff at breakfast and housekeeping in general). Plus their really shaky internet situation was a big issue for us, so the rating is a strong 3 for me. Hotel: The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel. It has 383 rooms and suites and was built in 1912. An important piece of fact for you people that really do your research in advance please do note that the hotel will undergo a massive renovation ($20 million) for their centennial celebration 2012!!! So maybe not a great idea to stay there until that\u00c2\u00b4s done...But probably fab afterwards! It feels very large and spacious with it\u00c2\u00b4s grande lobby. A lot of gorgeous details everywhere such as intricatley ornate celings for instance. Location: Right smack on Copley square. It is a great location to have as a starting point for most things that go around in the city. Walking distance from super shopping (both a mall + Newbury st), the Boston Symphony Orchestra hall, a lot of churches of interest, and even more good restaurants. There are also a lot of museums (both for adults and children) within easy taxi distance. Room: We had 2 rooms, 502 which is a deluxe king room + 501 which is a deluxe double bed room for our stay. The neat thing if you\u00c2\u00b4re travelling as a large family is that a small child can sleep in their crib the hallway that the hotel makes out of part of the corridor! The only slightly bad thing about this solution is that the \"extra\" doors aren\u00c2\u00b4t exactly very tightly closed so there is a lot of noise/light coming from the corridor. The rooms are rather large, and very comfortable. Yes, the style is very old fashioned, so if you want mega modern and sleek then maybe the Mandarin Oriental is a better bet for you. The bed was insanely comfortable!!! We also liked the pillows and bedlinen. Storage room is adequate. The shower is located in the bathtub, and it only has a fixed showerhead, no hand held shower. These particular rooms do not face the park, so the view is of a wall. At first we were slightly disappointed at this fact... But we then thought that maybe it is actually better as the main streets outside are very busy and it doesn\u00c2\u00b4t look as if the windows are mega sound proofed. So something to consider! Lovely Miller Harris amenities! Service: In general good and courteous. You can tell that most of the employees are very proud to be serving their grande old dame. Especially the front desk/door men staff were lovely! Very helpful and friendly! Speaking of employees, they have a black Labrador Retriever in the lobby!!!! Her name is Catie Copley , 9 years old, and she is at work most of the time. She is a lovely and low key dog whom our 3-year old daughter adored. She is even available for walks if you wish which is a fantastic service to be providing!!! It really put a special touch on our stay to be greeted by a dog almost every day. Food: Nothing out of the ordinary. Breakfast was quite good, service nice but very much on the slow side and not always accurate. Private dining arrived almost on time, was good and we had no complaints. Dry cleaning: Nothing to remark on. It arrived before the deadline and ironed well. Internet: *Sigh* This was an nuisance... We had a lot of problems with the WiFi...It fluctuated like mad! One second we had excellent reception, the next none at all, and it continued in this fashion all of our stay making it very difficult to work in our rooms. They also charge quite a lot for it!!! So a great tip is to, for free, become a member of their Presidents Club and have it for free + a whole lot of other perks. Staff: In general very nice, courteous and helpful. Especially the reception/concierge/door men men and women very lovely! The staff don\u00c2\u00b4t always get things, or the right rooms, right though. Like for instance: * We asked for extra towels as the maid hadn\u00c2\u00b4t given us new ones in the morning one day. They brought us 2 pillows. * They tried to deliver clothes belonging to another guest. * Not sure how many times we had to ask at breakfast in order to get juice/tea/coffee to the right person and in right amounts. In fact breakfast is so slow that your tea will have gone cold before even the toast arrives. Just little things like that which makes you wonder a bit. In room dining: Nothing to remark on. Arrived almost on time and was good Gift shops: Multiple very nice upscale shops! Some gorgeous eveningwear and bags. Don\u00c2\u00b4t go into them expecting to get your magazine or snack fix though (which was a very nice feeling!), do that at the 24/7 CVS pharmacy across the square instead Things to do: There are a plethora of activities to do in Boston!!! We made sure that we visited their excellent Childrens Museum with our 3 year old. There is also a lovely Aquarium (make sure to go there early as it becomes crazy busy!) + the Museum of Science which was very interesting. Went to see/listen to their world class Boston Symphony Orchestra on several nights!

Her is the negative aspects of staying at the Fairmont Copley. (1) the rooms were the size of a shoe box...it had to be the smallest $250 a night room I have ever stayed in my life. In fact, it was so small that they could not even squeeze in a dresser to put our clothes away. Yes, the only place to put clothes was in a very small 3 drawer night stand......we lived out of our suitcase for 3 days. The closet was not much better, and we had a hard time hanging clothes as the safe is proped up to almost half way un the closet. (2) Our room was not cleaned for 2 days...we slept in everyday and I guess the maid service decided since we did not leave the room till 1 o'clock..it was too late for them to come. (3) this may sound somewhat trite...but, there was no coffee maker in the hotel room. I have never been to a hotel in which they did not provide this very small but important convenience. I would assume they prefer you to order a $5 cup of coffee from room service than provide their customers this convenience. When we checked out and received our car from valet, nobody helped with our lugage, but, once they saw me load the bags into the car they immediately came over for a tip...that to me was unexcusable. The breakfast was very expensive and the service in the restaurant was extremely slow. Our waiter never came over to refresh our coffee and our $25 eggs took almost 40 minutes to be served. Like I said it was a beautiful hotel and was centrally located. We know that the Farmont is a fantastic chain of resort hotels and that is why we were extremely dissapointed.

Security came up and asked them to keep it quiet. Ten minutes later the sound level was back up and we called the desk again.

The grandeur of the lobby, tastefully decorated for christmas, is difficult to surpass. The front desk staff was first rate - helpful, polite, professional, quick, intelligent - a rarity nowadays. The room was spacious and clean, but the decor definitely tired. The tiled bathroom floor was cold and - together with the bathtub - certainly evokes memories of the first half of the last century. Yet, the shower was luxuriously strong and warm, making up for the otherwise uncozy feel of the bathroom. Two caveats: This is, as I said, an old hotel. The heating system, though thermostat controlled and very quiet, did not cope with the cold December weather. I was never able to get the temperature in my room above 69 degrees - usually it hovered around 65 degrees, with the thermostat set at 70 degrees and the fan blowing non-stop. Secondly, this hotel accepts pets, as at least one dog made it's presence known by barking day and night in one of the neighboring rooms. Not good for my allergic nose - I was congested and sneezing during my entire stay. If you are looking for an olde, historic grand hotel and don't mind a somewhat chilly, greyish-brownish room, you'll love this place. If you need top-notch luxury, this is not it. Oh, and they definitely need to get rid of those clowns (aka doormen) standing around the doors and chatting with each other while ignoring people who want to, quickly, come in from the cold and have to navigate around them. 50 % of the time I still had to open my own door since they were plain not paying attention.

Built in 1912 I believe - around there. It's right across the street from Trinity Church , the Boston Public Library, and Copley Square. The metro station is only a block away and Boston's transit system is so easy to use and cheap! The location can't be beat - you are right downtown with easy metro access to all the other touristy hot spots! It takes no time to get around in Boston - we even walked a lot of it! The metro takes you everywhere including Cambridge (great town - we got to see Harvard), the Aquarium where you can catch ferries to other places like Salem (that was a good day!), and to the airport! I was seriously impressed with their metro system. Far more superior than ours back home. If you ever need a cab those are cheap as well! It was $9 to get from Cambridge back to the hotel - not too shabby at all! If you stay here there is a good chance you'll meet the resident dog Catie Copley. She is an older black lab who has her own dog house outside and an area for her in the lobby. She is such a sweetie!! There is even a book about her that you can get in the gift shop called Catie Copley :) The room was quite large and very clean and very quiet. We had a view of the street and of the Boston Public Library. The bathroom is all marble and it's quite large. The massive giant head is great and made for wonderful good pressured showers! The beds were out of this world! They were so comfortable - it was hard to get out of them in the morning. I was tempted to steal their pillows as they were amazing (kidding, I would never steal those - but tell me where I can buy them!!) Don't fall prey to their overpriced room service menu or their Refreshment Center. Read the fine print. They charge a re-stocking fee, a tax, and a %18 percent surcharge. If you want them to take away the basket of tempting goodies they'll charge you $25 for that as well. There is a 7-11 nearby as well as many pharmacies so get you snack attacks filled up there.

And we loved it! Mr Batty and I were treating my brother and sister-in-law to this holiday as a celebratory present so we wanted something special - the Fairmont Copley Plaza certainly delivered something special. This is a truly wonderful hotel where every single person tries hard (and succeeds) to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, and in a very friendly way. Talking of comfort, I'd have to say that the beds were probably the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in in a hotel, with 'proper' pillows :) Our room arrangements were perfect. We'd asked for adjacent rooms and we were given 501 and 502 which are at the end of a corridor with a second door, effectively making the two rooms into a suite. We all loved the Oak Bar, and it was great to relax here with a Samuel Adams after a busy day. Also loved the way they serve the martini! And what can you say about Pasquale? Bless him! He was our server when we dined in the Oak Room - what a character, oozing with old-fashioned Italian charm - he really made our evening something special. Our meal in the Oak Room, by the way, was superb as was the marvellous Amarone. As other people have already said, the location of this hotel is excellent - very handy for the Trolley Bus which stops right outside - and is great for the Prudential Centre, Newbury Street, the Copley Plaza, and all the other many attractions. And with many great restaurants within walking distance. The harbour and acquarium are very easy to get to too. We really can't dredge up anything negative to say about this hotel, however hard we try. Our stay was as wonderful as we'd hoped, if not more, and we would definitely love to stay here again (and I'm sure we will as we love Boston, and now so do my brother and my sister-in-law). The only 'bad' thing about this hotel is that it is expensive; as we had to use the telephone quite a lot we were somewhat alarmed at the $4.50 charge just to make a non-local call, likewise the charge for wi-fi in the room. Hence, I couldn't give Value a higher rating. To finish on a positive note, we'd like to thank the Fairmont Copley Plaza for such a wonderful stay and we definitely hope to be back before too long.

I thought the staff was very friendly--check-in and check-out were smooth, any concerns/questions were handled promptly and sufficiently. My room itself was small overall (including the bathroom; especially the closet), but had enough room to roam. The only issue was related to the air conditioner and thermostat in the room. The temperature was set as low as 40 degrees, but for some reason, the room had a very difficult time flushing out any heat and humidity. The engineering staff did their best to try to correct the situation, but with any classic building, the concern cannot always be remedied overnight. I suggested to the front desk at check-out to shut down the room for a couple days to try to get the thermostat and air conditioner back in working order. Other than being uncomfortable at times, I understand the complexity of this issue since the building I work at is over 100 years old and has no air conditioning period...just good old fans that work hard to flush out any heat/humidity depending on the air flow outside. I did not eat/drink in the hotel restaurant/bar per se, but had breakfast in a separate room with my conference acquaintances. Overall, I thought the food was very good. The hotel has a couple shops, but I did not visit them. Catie Copley was in the lobby a couple times, but was resting from the intense heat. She did seem to be visitor friendly, however. Overall, I thought the hotel was good and would recommend it to the business traveler or tourist looking for elegance.

Went back to front desk, spoke to a different clerk who told us there were no king deluxe rooms available.

The room service menu is better than most and breakfasts are very tasty and the room they're served in is not to be missed.

The exterior and lobby of the building are beautiful. Built in 1912, the hotel retains its historic charm. It is in a perfect location for those exploring Boston. The front desk staff was warm and friendly at check-in. Being President's Club members, we were upgraded to the JFK Suite. Pictures of the Kennedy family graced the walls and books on their lives filled the bookshelves. This room would appeal to any history buff. The location of the room was also a plus; being a corner suite, it had windows facing Copley Plaza in the living room and bedroom, as well as window onto Dartmouth Street with a view of the Boston Library. The room was beautiful with a lovely entryway, living room and bedroom. I loved the marble fireplace and big, original windows. The bathroom however definitely needed updating. (E.g. The pipe leading ot the showerhead had tape on it to prevent leaking. It didn't work.) Also, the carpet looked like it needed a thorough cleaning but had not had one in years. Here's where the real trouble started... In the morning, we went down to the Oak Room for breakfast (part of our weekend package.) Although there was a buffet provided we were told by 3 people (waiter, host and woman at the front desk) that we could instead chose to order anything from the menu. We had 2 (mid-priced) breakfasts, coffee for me, juice for him and a side of berries. Everything was delicious and we checked out happy with a nice stay. A few days later however, we checked our credit card statement and saw $100+charge from the Fairmont on top of our room charge. The customer service rep we spoke with told us that we had a maximum of $70 to spend on breakfast and we went over. (Um, shouldn't there be a $30 charge on the bill then?!) We relayed the information we had received from 3 different people at the hotel and she took the charge off. There was a second erroneous charge on our bill as well! We were charged for items from the mini-bar. (Neither of us even touched the $7 water bottles on the desk nor did we see a mini-bar in the room!) Both errors were fixed, but only because WE caught in the error in the first place and spent 40 minutes on the phone with customer service. Ugh.

For example, the door frames in my room had some paint chipping off, and the carpeting in the bedroom area was showing signs of wear and tear.

When I would ask him questions, I felt as if it was really bothering him to have to answer me. Another concierge (John, I believe?) was very nice and friendly. The doormen were nice, again if you spoke to them first, but none went out of their way to be friendly. Overall, the hotel is beautiful on the exterior and quite pretty inside.

It is over-decorated in the public rooms to the extreme (which I happened to enjoy for the camp value) and the general appearance of the place is good. My room was very comfortable. Good quality linen on the bed, nice bathroom. Ipod dock. More comfortable than many hotel rooms. But it was also very small, which I didn't like - especially as a business traveller spending more time in the room than I would if I were on holiday. The cable was useless too - with very limited channel selection. All this would have been fine but what really left me annoyed was the desk staff. They were hopeless. Very young, and clearly in need of training (they mastered 'Hello Mr ____' whenever I walked by, a curious feature of upper level American hotels which always leaves me unnerved - what's wrong with 'sir'?). I checked in at about 5pm only to be told that my room wasn't ready and I'd have to wait an hour. This is pretty poor form for 5pm by which time the rooms should really have been turned around - especially with a check in time of 3pm advertised. Did they offer me a free drink in the bar with a newspaper whilst I waited? Somewhere to sit? (bear in mind it was FREEZING outside) Anything at all? Nope. Even the worst B&B in the world would give you a cup of tea and the local paper rather than send you out onto the streets. I returned in an hour and the room STILL wasn't ready. So I waited in the lobby on a chair, still not being offered any apology or refreshment, but able to make eyes at 'Catie Copley' the hotel's 'Canine Ambassador' (that's Boston soi-disant-posh for 'dog'). I was clearly considered a huge annoyance for arriving at 5pm - two hours after my paid for room was meant to be available to me. All I wanted was a shower and a gin. Eventually I got my room, but there was a difficulty with payment as it was meant to be handled from the UK by my office. We had failed to send things through properly. Fine, I put the deposit on my card and waited for payment to come through from London. This caused all manner of problems - I had a form faxed through to the hotel. They didn't get it. They said they didn't have it at the desk. I could SEE IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES FROM IN FRONT OF THE DESK. They still maintained it wasn't there and refused to let me point out to them where it was. Eventually after having finally communicated its location they were able to process things, but it was like something from a 60s farce. Admittedly there was lots of stuff going on at the desk and the duty manager was stressed (which she seemed to blame on me) but really! I am unfailingly polite to hotel staff. I know that often if something is wrong it's not their fault. And it wasn't. Fairmont clearly haven't spent the money to train their staff in any level of crisis management - or they haven't employed people with enough experience to work at a managerial level. The upshot? When you have this many headaches to deal with you suddenly realise, that the gym is rubbish, there's no sauna/steam room (pretty standard in 'luxury' hotels now), the public areas amount to an overdecorated lobby, the breakfast costs $30, and the internet is so expensive that you need to take out a mortgage in order to use it.

Italian lunch at a charming place called Bella Vista. We took the \"T\" back to Copley, it was all extremely easy and convenient - the Fairmont is in a nice location. The hotel room itself was great - super comfy beds, nice linens and very roomy. The marble bathroom was enormous. One thing I have to mention is the room service, which we ordered a couple of times. I've never stayed at a place where the room service was so prompt! Our food at the Copley was awesome, fresh and nicely presented, and not horrendously expensive (the creamless tomato soup is exquisite). My one complaint (minor) about the hotel is that the walls might be a tad thin and we were treated to the squealing, screeching kids next door, who were probably extremely loud anyway. Didn't hear any other noise from other rooms/guests during the rest of the stay. Also, it's a little dark - small windows and not a lot of natural light, but that's hardly a deal breaker in my book.

I suspect becos of the cheaper rate(which was still far more than other 4*stars in the area) we were put in this room. The person on one side was obviously a night owl and then the traffic and trucks etc started early on the Sat. morning so we slept poorly. Room service: Ridiculously expensive,.Quite frankly it was appalling and a rip off. We knew before we ordered what the prices were, but when one orders croissants(2 in an order), one does NOT expect to be sent 2 mini croissants, literally about an inch and a half long and half an inch wide. 2 teas, 1 order of croIssants and 1 order of English muffins was $35. I did not object to paying as I did not want to trek to a coffee shop , but this was just disgusting. There is bagel place across Copley Square and an Au Bon Pain nearby so for the next to days we went out for breakfast. needless to say for a 1/3 of the price we had way more food. Lobby is gorgeous, however rooms are rather tired and dated. Carpet musty . Paint peeling in places. Baseboards need a good wipedown. Bathroom: Large, but balloon valences in a sheer fabric and that do not close fully are Not suitable, especially when you are on a lower floor. Hopefully noone got a birds eye view . Tiling was kinda weird and not co-ordinated which also hinted that this was possibly a sub standard room. I cannot imagine anyone paying full price for it. Bathroom had ample towels, soaps etc. Room also had an iron/ironing board. Room safe. Free internet if you are a PC member, which we are. I have stayed in other Fairmonts, Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper, Bermuda and this was our worst experience.

It is such a beautiful place to have a wedding. The pictures you see on their website are real--the function rooms really look like that, beautiful, opulent, like a fairy tale. We had an hors d'oeuvres reception in the Venetian room, which then opened into the Oval room, where we had dinner. We took pictures in their grand lobby, and most of the guests stayed at the hotel as well, as they offered us very good rates (almost 1/2 the usual rate). Another friend got married at the Grand Ballroom, which is like a scene out of \"Beauty and the Beast\", but the room was far too big for us. The food was good at the wedding, and the service was excellent. We asked them to raise the temperature of the room (b/c it was January), so everyone (mostly from out of state/country) was warm and cosy. The wedding coordinator was OK--she did everything we asked her to, and didn't miss anything, but she was so difficult to contact while we were planning the wedding. It seems she is overworked and has too many weddings/events to coordinate, but the least we expect from a wedding coordinator is that she reply to emails in a timely manner, which she does not. We stayed at a suite, which was grand, large, and very comfortable. I especially like the large closets, the fluffy bathrobes, slippers, and the good quality soaps and shampoos (with cotton balls, and all amenities) in the bathroom. All the other guests seemed to enjoy their room too. For tourists, this hotel is centrally located in the heart of Boston, and is walking distance to lots of food, shopping, and sights. It's also right near a T stop (public transportation). We really enjoyed this hotel. It has such character and charm, and is so luxurious.

As I have stayed at this hotel many times before, it saddens me to write this review. But after being so audaciously lied to by the manager, I have no choice. My son and I attempted the check in in the early afternoon. I knew it was early and fully expected to have to leave our bags with the bellman and come back later to get our room. Instead, we were told that the hotel was already fully booked for the evening and we were offered the alternative of the Fairmont on the Boston Harbor, several miles away. (Why they thought that would be acceptable to a party booking into Copley Square is beyond me and shows the compete ignorance of the management, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a side issue.)

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s usually late at night when the hotel has filled up with new arrivals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is no less pleasant, but at least understandable. As it was early afternoon I told the manager that I did not believe that they had not one single open room. She said they had none and that they expected only three more check-ins that day, all of whom would be walked. This was absurd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what hotel in a major city has only four check-ins a day? But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the punch line. Another party arrived behind us. The manager shooed them over to a private part of the desk and checked them in! So much for no rooms at the inn! Lord knows how many others were checked in after we left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I bet at least a dozen. Why my prepaid reservation was not honored I do not know, but it was not because they had no available rooms. When the property manager lies so blatantly about a simple matter like being overbooked, it makes one wonder what other deceits are being made to paying guests. Bottom line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was classy hotel in a great location. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in a great location, the most generous thing to be said about its management is that they lie to their patrons. Why, I do not know. Yes, after protest, they put us up at a hotel nearby and got our luggage and car there too. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pre-pay for a reservation at the Fairmont in order to be lied to and walked. Next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just book into the lovely hotel they sent me to and forget about this once great Boston hotel.

This hotel is 100 years old and although it has obviously been updated over time, it is showing it's age such as the noisy air conditioner and small closet. The bathroom is small too. Amenities of this high 4 star hotel are surprisingly basic. There is no coffee making machine in the room and also has no free Internet access. Even the 2-star HI Express has those. The bathroom amenities are limited to the standard shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. My room and furnishing were otherwise in satisfactory condition. Sound insulation was not very good and you can hear people walking pass. Room service for a continental breakfast is US$21 plus US$4.50 \"delivery charge\". This is the first time that I saw a \"delivery charge\" for room service. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. My room has only one tiny window, probably reflective of the design of the era when the hotel was built. The location of this hotel is directly across from Copley Square and is 5 minutes' walk to the Copley T station and 10 minutes to the Prudential Shopping Centre.

To have that upgrade, they made us comfortable in our childrens' room ( a very nice room), and had ours ready and directly across the hall (simply lovely room) by the time we returned from a walk around back bay. Moments after we went to our room, champagne (and sparkling water in case we were not drinkers) and fresh fruit arrived at our door with a birthday card and a gracious gentleman delivering the tray.

They all had a wonderful way of being there with exactly what would make the moment special, at just the right moment, without being even slightly obtrusive.

From the moment you step out of the taxi you feel like royalty, starting with the friendly doormen, and the lobby was the most ornate I had ever seen. Check in was friendly and efficient. We had orignally booked two rooms, but we could only realize if we needed both when we got to Boston. We explained the circumstances to the clerk and she was happy to cancel one room despite the 24-hour cancellation policy. Even the hallways of the hotel was something special, keeping with the huge and ornate theme. Now in most hotels, when you enter your room, you enter in a narrow corridor with the bathroom on one side and the closet on the other. Not so with this hotel. Here, the space that the bathroom and closet would normally take up is freed up since they're both moved to the side of the room, thus creating a 'standard' room that is in reality like the 'deluxe' rooms of other hotel chains. Of course, all the furnishings were beautiful and the bed was extra-comfy. As an added bonus, in addition to the compuslory collection of dowdy lamps, there was a realy nice functional chandelier as the main source of light! The bathroom was a bit tight, but was extra-modern and had a wall of storage cubbies. However the bathroom was also where our main complaint stemmed from - the housekeeping. The first warning sign was a collection of long hairs left by a previous guest on the bath mat. But then, as our stay went on, toilitries would not get replinished our would just sometimes disappear! One evening we arrived at the hotel to find our toilet paper had been taken away and not replaced.

We did ask reception to be moved to be told that each room faced the same way (which was not true). However, we stayed in the room and funnily enough either got used to the noise or just didn't notice it after the first night, so if you do go make sure you ask whether the room is at the back where the generator is.

The other thing is the unofficial Harvard University Tour which is done by students of the University. Again great fun and very informative. A tip is usually given of 10 dollars per person at the end of the tour. Quincy market is the place to hang out during the day and at night where there is the famous food court, street performers, shopping etc. Find Filenes Department Store for discounted designer shopping, it's a must and also visit Little Italy.

Again, the food and service were basically fine, but not exceptional. One complaint that we did have was with the fact that we were told by Reservations that the hotel had a nice workout facility. This was not the case. The workout facility was comprised of a small, poorly ventilated fitness room with outdated equipment. Also, it is worth mentioning that the hotel does not have a swimming pool or spa services. On several occasions we ventured to the Oak Bar for a change of scenery as the weather was not cooperating.

If you are arriving at Logan Airport don't take the expensive taxi as we did as you can buy a 7 day T pass(underground ticket) for $15 that will take you right to the hotel (taxi cost about $36 from Airport). Just Jump on the Silver Line Bus which will take you to the underground station and go to Copley and when you come out of the station it's right in front of you(I would recommend buying a T pass anyway as it's the best way to get round the city and takes you to nearly all the tourist sites of interest). Check in at this hotel is easy and staff are friendly and courteous. The rooms are very nice and beds are very comfortable. All in all it was everything I expected from this class of hotel and I wasn't disappointed. The only criticisms I would have of the room is that the TV is at the side of the bed so is awkward to watch and there is no sofa or chairs in the room apart from a desk chair so you have to sit on the edge of the bed all the time to watch TV. We stayed in a Queen room so maybe worth paying a bit more and getting a better room with chairs etc. Bathroom was spacious and very clean. The negatives of the hotel were first of all the internet access - I can't believe they don't have free computer use for guests - I checked my email for less that two minutes and it cost me almost $7 - that's unacceptable in this day and age. Also, in the Oak Room Bar at the hotel there is a sign saying that there is a dress code - this did not seem to apply to the prostitute who was openly \"touting\" for business wearing very little one afternoon much to the embarrassment of many of the people in the bar including family groups with children.

My birthday was a few days away so when I placed my reservation I signed up for the the President's club. When we arrived we were given a free upgrade (we had requested ahead of time). When we got to the room, there was a bottle of champagne and box of chocolates with a birthday card from the manager. It was a very nice touch. The room was impeccable and very large. Our king size bed felt like an XXLarge bed - it was huge! The sheets and pillows were incredibly soft and the bathroom was very large and very clean. The bathroom amenities were all Herman Miller and there was plenty of shampoo and conditioner! My only criticism of the bathroom is that you couldn't pull the shower curtain all the way around the tub, even though the bar for it was there, it was just a little weird. There was a wide screen tv and two comfy chairs next to a non-working fireplace. The view was also very nice - see the pic. I believe we were in room 629, it faced copley square and the church, see the pics. We had a reservation for the Oak Room downstairs and I stopped by the bar early to get a small bite and a drink. It was a little slow at the bar in terms of service, it was Christmas and they seemed short staffed. Dinner in the Oak Room was delicious and the portions were large. The service was fantastic and we never felt ignored. Our table was in a small, more private room in the restaurant. The main dining room was busy and a little too loud for me. Maybe because it was Christmastime and the hotel was not that full so I did not hear doors slamming from the other guests at all at night like some other tripadvisor reviewers did. Our room, however, was across from the door used by the cleaning crew, so I did hear that door close a few times the next morning. By the way, there was and still is some construction being performed to the huge windows on the Dartmouth street side. The windows are to the Oak Room restaurant, but they just closed the curtains and we didn't notice when we were inside. If I were staying today, I would not request a room on the 2nd floor dartmouth street side, it is not a great view and the construction might be a problem in terms of noise during the day.

The bathroom was very roomy and the shower had great water pressure. The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby. The only less than glowing comment I can make relates to security, or rather, the appearance thereof. Since this is an older hotel, they don't have a system in the elevator where you need to use your room key to gain access to your floor. Also, while the room key was the standard modern card model, the door handle itself was still rather old fashioned and ornate. While this certainly fit in with the overall theme of the hotel, the result is that my door never seemed to close with a tight seal and I had the impression that breaking into the room wouldn't be all that hard if someone were so inclined.

The valet handed my baggage directly to the bellman, so I didn't even have to worry about them at check in. Check in was very smooth. They gave a us a complimentary upgrade from the standard Fairmont room to a deluxe room. Great I always appreciate a comped upgrade. (I have stayed here in the past in the standard fairmont room, and it's a nice room) The deluxe room was actually a suite and it was awesome! There is a sitting room with a desk, two arm chairs, an ipod docking station and a TV. There was also a decent sized closet in that room. The bathroom was very large. The vanity was a decent size, but not huge. There was an extra shelf to the left of it that was very handy as I was getting ready for a formal party. The bedroom was a good size considering there was a seperate sitting room. The bedroom had king sized bed, a large flat screen TV and an ipod docking alarm clock. There was a second good sized closet off the bedroom as well. The hotel staff was fantastic. My boyfriend had to work late and didin't arrive to the hotel to get ready for the party until I had already finished getting ready and left for the party. The front desk had a key waiting for him, so he could get ready as quickly as possible since he was already going to be late for the party. The concierge was helpful giving me directions to the location of the party about a 10 minute walk away. They have on past visits helped me with dining recomendations as well. After the party, my boyfriend had enjoyed the party we had been at a bit too much and the doormen was great. He helped my boyfriend back to the room and made sure we got in ok. I was embarassed about the state my boyfriend was in, but he was very professional about helping him. When I woke up, a list of all the charges to room had been placed under my door for my review. Everything on it was expected and fair. My car was waiting for me in as I had called the valet like they requested 15 minutes prior to when I wanted to leave. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. 5 stars, I will be back for whenever I need to stay downtown. All in all, I was very pleased with my stay. My only vriticism would be the view from our room. We looked out over the roof of another part of the building and into other rooms. I really didn't care since we got a free upgrade to the bigger room, but if I had come from far away and was staying for more than a night, I may have been disapointed with it. My only other regret is that we didn't get to take advantage of any of the great facilities the hotel had to offer. Boston is a great city and the location of the Fairmont in Back Bay is perfect for exploring. If you are visiting the area, be sure to head over to the north end.

I would recommend the hotel for its location, generally attentive staff, its ambiance, and a few other things. We traveled as a family while my husband attended a conference and I came with the baby. We arrived after a red eye, having paid for the day before ($300 night) to ensure the room was ready, which it was, including the crib. Nice. I had inquired if there was a refrigerator -- needed to just store a small bottle - and they put in a small refrigerator in the room (nice intentions) but there was already a mini bar fridge in the room, thus making it unnecessary, especially since it broke the second day. We were not able to get the Club level, which probably would have been great given the other reviews, and we had a fairly small room, especially since there were two refrigerators (again, thanks, but just the mini bar would have worked). The bed was comfortable and there was an iPod stereo which was nice. Okay, the negatives...room service. Because of the 14 month old, I had to order room service a few times and we had problems with both the quality of food and missing items (which were rectified). So, if you can avoid it, don't order room service. Also, it is an older facility and so the heating conditions vary. I had to open the window (and it was really cold) so the the room could become more climate, but this wasn't an ideal solution. The only other negative is that there wasn't always a doorman, which was difficult when I was returning alone to the hotel with a stroller, but there was always a lot of foot traffic so someone generally opened the doors for us. What I really liked about the hotel was the concierge, Jim, and his black lab, Catie, who is at the hotel during the day. They are fantastic (and you can buy a book which goes to charity). The staff always gave me good tips on shopping, as well as restaurants, which is so important. Also, the Oak Room is an old style bar which is nice to enjoy a drink (sans enfants). The other positive is that the hotel is close to a Hertz and it is near the highway ramp going to New York, where we went after being in Boston. The only other tip is that if you join their club you can avoid the daily $15 internet access charges.

We specifically wanted to be within walking distance of Newbury St. and they are within 2 blocks. This hotel was the 2nd most expensive of the ones we compared, but it looked so beautiful we decided it was worth it. It was! The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the whole hotel makes you feel like you've gone back in time. Our room was small (perfect for two people without a ton of luggage), but we knew that going in and it we didn't intend to spend a lot of time in it so it didn't matter. My first impression of the room was that it was very clean, which is something most hotel rooms do not do to me. Even the bathroom was sparkling and I'm usually most wary of those. Also the bed had to be most comfortable bed we ever slept in. We were totally in love with it after the first night. We had forgotten to ask for a late check out so we called down to the front desk and we told it wasn't a problem. Overall the staff was exceptionaly friendly and accommodating. When we realized my husband forgot his razor, it was immediately sent up with some shaving cream. We were only booked for one night but the second day we were having so much fun we decided to extend our stay. Even though we had checked out, when we called to book again we were treated as though we had never left. We even got the same room again. Only a few minor things worth being aware of. Our room was near the elevator and it seemed that hallway noise came straight in through our door so that woke us up a bit in the morning. Second, the tub in the bathroom connected to the sink with a small counter, no glass. The shower curtain didn't close the whole gap (it ran along one side and the end) so you had to choose which end to let the water escape from. And lastly, the parking seemed expensive ($42/day) but I suppose thats fairly standard for city rates. Overall we loved staying here and are already trying to work out if we can stay again when we have to be in Boston again in October. For its central location to Newbury and Boylston streets with the shops and restaurants it just can't be beat.

The Prudential Mall is 5 minutes away, and the Common the same in the opposite direction. Also on the positives, the room was pleasant, clean and relatively spacious, and it was a very comfortable stay (the bed was fantastic). The staff are pleasant, and the air-con was more than adequate. The room (ours was on the 6th Floor) had a large closet space, which meant your room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be cluttered with cases, and contained a safe box and iron/ironing-board. Right, the bad news: The room has an extensive supply of outrageously overpriced minibar items, but no coffee or tea facilities, which is a bit of a pain.

If you are staying on the Gold Level (4th Floor) there is free WiFi, which we could access in our room and can be picked up in other areas of the hotel. Room service was a joke. We had to ring three times to get an order put through, and while the cost on the menu wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too different that other hotels in this range, the extra costs added on were ridiculous\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. on top of the menu prices there is a 18% gratuity (which when forced on you isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a gratuity at all, now is it?), $5 delivery charge (so what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 18% for?) and tax. This meant we ended up paying nearly 35% more for the room service than the menu prices indicate. Fair enough, they tell you this on the menu, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the excess any more palatable. Naturally, we decided against room service other nights, and instead settled for stocking up on snacks from the 7-Eleven and CVS across the square. The hotel itself is quite impressive, the lobby and reception areas are more like a grand imperial hotel in Europe, and for location alone, I would probably stay here again, but my expectations would be a lot less, and room service would be off the list.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNot Exceptional - but Not Terrible, either\u201d", "Author": "Mary-Loves-Paris", "ReviewID": "UR19386246", "Content": "The Fairmont Copley Plaza is a very traditional hotel with a grand Titanic-esque feel. Makes you think like you've stepped back in time in many ways - which is a little strange because they claim to have spent millions on updating recently. The lobby looks like the Palace at Versailles, and the staff was welcoming. I had high hopes. But then we arrived to our room... Our first room was adjacent to the service elevator. After hearing that thing run every couple minutes for nearly the entire first night, we knew we'd go crazy if we didn't relocate. Since we were staying at the hotel for another four nights, I expressed to the front desk the importance of switching to a quieter room. Seriously, I would have bailed and found a new hotel had they not been able to change my room - it was that bad. (The Westin is nearby, as is the Four Seasons).... I thought the hotel was full up, but staff was able to find something for us and even offered to move all our things for us. Thankfully, the new room (No. 582) was a huge improvement. It was ADA accessible so it was expansive. Bed was super-comfy and the room included bath robes, an iron and ironing board, and nice toiletries. The air conditioner was quirky, however: it didn't have automatic climate controls, so you either had to leave it on (which was a bit noisy for sleeping) or turn it off (which meant the room heated up while you were sleeping, causing you to wake quite warm in the middle of the night). Some other minor disappointments: no in-room coffee or tea; no seats other than a sturdy desk chair; and while they like to boast that the windows open for fresh air, you certainly wouldn't want to do so. If your room overlooked the street, the street noise would be too much. If your room was on the inner courtyards (as ours was), the noise from the massive air conditioners would be too overwhelming (we could hear them with the windows closed). Internet connection in the room was $14 per 24-hours of service. Your basic one-litre bottle of Evian water was $7 plus tax plus 10% restocking fee, and the half-bottle of Coppola red table wine in the honor bar was a whopping $16. I bet they don't sell many of those, since there's a CVS market and a liquor store right across Copley Square. Never did find the exercise room - location was not apparent. Breakfast in the Oak Room was convenient but quite spendy. Granted, it's the most beautiful room in the building - but you're paying for the civility of cloth napkins and attentive waiters. The food was okay, but there's an Au Bon Pain just a block away that can give you a good breakfast for half the price. Or stock up on packaged Entenmann's pastries and a bottle of Odwalla juice from the CVS and call it good. Now the good point: this hotel is in a excellent location for seeing everything. Newbury Street is just two blocks over and the river is just a couple more blocks beyond that... There's a metro stop for the Green Line just across the plaza (convenient for getting to the heart of downtown or out to the Museum of Fine Arts)... The Trolley Tour goes right past the front door of the hotel (buy tix from the Concierge)... And the Prudential Center for shopping and dining at Legal Seafood is just down the street.

The hotel is gorgeous, rooms spotless and elegant without being overly gaudy. Lobby had plenty of seating for quick meetings or private calls. The bar soap/shampoo was top of the line! (With airline \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carry on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd baggage rules it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just easier NOT to pack those items and use the hotel offerings for these over night trips.) Being a young business traveler, and looking younger, the staff was a bit more relaxed with the formalities. The kindly noted that I dislike being referred to by my last name. I'm giving this a 5 star review b/c it deserves it. But I will note a few odd things that could have really annoyed some guests paying out of pocket. First, as I was washing my hands in the bathroom sink the water kept filling up. Apparently, the stopper came off from the hinge in the down position. I had to go under the sink and push it up. Second, the bedside clock (which was an iPod/mp3 docking and charging station!) was set to the wrong time. For the life of me, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to change the time! I got back to my room so late I just wanted to sleep in the compfy king size bed, so I used my blackberry for the clock during the night and requested a wake up call. For a business traveler this is a very comfortable hotel. Laptop/internet hook-ups in the room.

We reserved one of their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchotel within a hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold Signature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms and highly recommend this added indulgence. After checking several web sites, we found the hotels own web site actually offered the best nightly rate for the Gold Signature accomodations and number of booking options. The interior of the hotel is elegantly appointed and reminiscent of a bygone golden age of lavish and extravagantly designed hotels. The staff were equally as attentive and professional as the ambiance was sophisticated. The Fairmont \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold Signature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 level is on its own special floor (4th flr.) and provides a private check-in desk on the 4th floor just for guests staying on the Gold Signature floor. Amenities on this floor include a private, multiple room lounge area classically decorated complete with crackling fireplace and mantle, and a large pantry (the size of a standard kitchen). These rooms are all connected together in one area by doorways and create a sort of large square floor plan with each room decorated differently. One of the rooms was decorated in the style of a classic personal home Library and included books and a small collection of DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that Gold guests can bring to their room which all include DVD players. There was also a large closet sized room with two computer stations with fax printers and free internet. High speed internet access is also included in all Gold Signature rooms. During the morning and early evenings, the counters in the pantry are lined with a generous spread of complimentary food and drink, however, there is a significant collection of wine and liquor set up during most other hours of the day and evening. All food and non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary, but the liquor is an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHonor Bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in which guests mix their own drinks from the well stocked collection of full size liquor bottles and are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrequested\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to write on a provided piece of paper any alcohol that they take which is charged to your room. As the pantry is unsupervised (except for the occasional staff person checking to ensure nothing needs refilling), they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to police the policy, but do appeal to people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honesty in abiding by the honor system. At 5:00, the pantry was setup with a very nice number hors d'oeuvres including imported cheeses & crackers, scallops wrapped in bacon, spinach stuffed puff pastry, humus, prosciutto and cheese stuffed hot peppers, and many other items. Breakfast consisted of both hot and cold items including your standard breads, pastries, croissant, eggs bacon, home fries, smoked salmon, yogurt and granola parfait, fruits and cereals as well as other items. During all times of day there was an endless supply of juices, soda, and water. Several newspapers were also available for guests relaxing in the Gold lounge. Our Gold Sig King room was very nice and slightly on the large size for a studio room. It was not overly appointed, but was very nice and classically styled. The room included a nice Bose 'like' stereo system with iPod docking station on one of the night stands, a business desk with stationary, chairs and small round table, and amoire with enclosed standard TV (not Plasma or flat screen) and minibar. The Bathroom had a standard shower tub and rather small vanity sink. While nice, I expected a slightly more luxurious bath for the price of the Gold Signature accommodations, but it was still nice. The obligatory plush robes were of course there as well. At night, turn down service is standard in all Gold Sig rooms. When we returned to our rooms later that evening, the bedspread was removed and neatly folded in the corner of the room, slippers on the floor on either side of the bed, lights dimmed, and soft classical music playing on the Bose stereo. A small bottle of Evian water and small drinking glass were also neatly placed on both night stands. We did not experience the hotels one restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Oak Room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but we did relax in the Oak Bar late during the evening for some fine wine and conversation. The room was very classy and cozy with a live band playing classic tunes at an audible level low enough to partake in conversation yet loud enough to still be enjoyed. Martini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were $20 a pop but that is about the norm in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultra luxury hotel lobby bars. The last appointment that we rather enjoyed seeing and surprised that such a posh hotel would allow was Cattie, the Canine Ambassador. Cattie is the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident Black Lab and is a retired Seeing Eye dog living out the rest of her days greeting guests as they arrive in the main lobby area. She was very sweet and friendly, yet unobtrusive and never seemed to approach guests on her own but rather seemed to wait for guests to come to her. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still allowed, but the Copley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s web site states Cattie can actually be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcborrowed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for morning or daily walks by guests who miss their own four legged loved ones left at home. As I understand it, Cattie does not live in the hotel and goes home at the end of her busy work day with one of the hotel employees which I believe is now her owner. On a side note, this would be much more exciting an anecdote had we actually SEEN him, but there was a rumor through out the hotel that Tom Hanks was staying at the hotel on the Gold Signature Floor as well. Of course the staff were all tight lipped and denied any knowledge of his presence when pressed, but that is of course expected and a reflection of their professionalism. The next evening while watching the local news at home, who but Mr. Hanks himself was shown being interviewed on the news at the Boston Public Library which is literally across the street from the Copley, so there may very well have been some truth to the rumor that weekend. All in all, we will most definitely return to the Copley and the Gold Signature floor again and highly recommend it for a classy, extravagant escape.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cUnfortunate experience\u201d", "Author": "LynnMaine", "ReviewID": "UR13127620", "Content": "Lovely hotel, but unfortunately our stay was marred by a theft.

As we had a long flight from Australia to Boston, we decided to arrange for a car to meet us at the airport. I called the hotel concierge a week before to arrange this and the driver was there to meet our late night flight which was most welcome after our very long day of travelling. The hotel was really well located for a tourist in Boston. Many attractions are within walking distance, a subway station is across the street and the Amtrak rail station is a couple of blocks away. We hired a car from Avis when we left Boston and it was also walking distance near the Amtrak station. The hotel is a beautiful historic building - only 6 0r 7 storeys high - with lots of ambiance. It reminded us of the Willard Hotel in Washington DC, where we have stayed previously. The rooms have all been renovated but still have that classic style rather than a modern look. Our room was a good size and the King bed was extremely comfortable. We slept very soundly during our stay. The Fairmont Gold concept is excellent. The whole of the 4th Floor is devoted to Fairmont Gold rooms and the dedicated concierge, lounge and breakfast room is based at one corner near the elevators. We had a room facing Copley Square which provided excellent views. The windows are double glazed, so it was very quiet. While the cost of the Gold rooms is more than the normal guest rooms, the inclusions make up for the difference. For example, the buffet breakfast with waiter service is free, the internet is free, overnight shoe shine is free and you have access to a large lounge area with an open fire, newspapers, games etc. The breakfast was excellent and it was very easy to walk from your room to the lounge area each morning. The Gold staff was delightful, friendly, personal and extremely helpful. For example, we locked our selves out of our room one morning and they prepared two more keys while we had breakfast, wrapping them in a huge red ribbon so we wouldn't miss them. The concierge even remembered our room number. Our experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza was wonderful and really made our visit to Boston an enjoyable one. We would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a 4/5 star experience in Boston.

It was our first time visiting in Boston and we wanted nice a upscale hotel that was in a great location. The Fairmont Copley is it! Wonderful Location!!!! We didn't have a problem walking all over the city and getting back to the hotel. It is blocks away from many restaurants, Newbury Street, the Public Gardens and Boston Common. It took us 15 min. walking to get to Fenway Park. Really GREAT location! The customer service was just perfect. John the bellman was a real sweetheart, the front desk accomodated our request for early check-in and late check-out. In room dining was great, a little pricey (average for this calibur hotel) and the food was good. There are a couple of things I think are important to note for those people who like to know what went \"wrong\". This is an old hotel. Don't expect roomy bathrooms or anything but a toilet, sink and small shower/tub. The closet is small. The iron leaked. There was no automatic turn down service, if you wanted it, you had to call and request it. For this type of hotel, I would expect this service. The sheets were a bit rough to me. I have slept in much softer, including my own. The shower curtain was a bit stained and the tv made a funny hissing noise. That is all I found to be \"off\" from another upscale hotel.

If you check the hotel's website, you will see they offer more guest room classes than most hotels. I don't think the Moderate Room is even offered if you call Fairmont reservations directly, it is reserved for people who book through the sources I mentioned above. While the Moderate Room itself is decorated fine, a bit small (beware - queen bed only, no choice of a king or double beds), and the bathroom cramped, it would be bearable if it were not for the HORRIBLE SMELL. We were on the 1st floor (the hotel only has 6 floors) and there was a strong stench of sewer plus the smoke from adjacent smoking rooms permeate our non-smoking room. They actually have smoking and non-smoking rooms in the same hallway. It was not a pleasant night of sleep and we had a young child who smelled like a cigarette in the morning. The housekeeping staff even told my husband this was the worst wing of the hotel and we should have them move us. They were fully booked the 1st night, but upon request on the second night we were moved to a \"Fairmont Room\" with a king bed on a floor with no smells. I am sure that many guests complain about these \"Moderate Rooms\" and the hotel staff is used to moving guests to better rooms if available. What I find disappointing is a four star hotel such as the Fairmont even offers such rooms, albeit at a discount, to unsuspecting guests. These are second tiers rooms that are probably not even worth the discounted rate paid by guests. This experience has really turned me off of using Priceline and staying at any Fairmont properties.

First, the heater was pumping 80* into the room with no relief, and the window that should have opened did not. The bed was a double, not a queen-size, which is what we had paid for and even been told at the front desk we were supposed to get. The worst by far was when we tried to finally sleep- there was a loud obnoxious party across the hall. By 12:30 at night I had called 4 times to the front desk to do something about it. *Four times!* Security did not do anything about it, and by the final time, I went downstairs in my PJ's to tell them it wasn't being taken care of. Their \"Four Star\" security was just standing around on their walkie talkies while the party continued with the doors wide opened. I finally stated we'd be willing to switch to another room. So, at 1 in the morning, we packed up our stuff and had to move to another room. And the 2nd room smelled like something had died in it. Luckily the heater wasn't broken in this one, but the odor was horrible. We decided to make the best of it, because clearly telling the apathetic staff at this hotel that anything is wrong is a waste of energy. The next morning I spoke to the manager and told him of the awful experience. I told him if we wanted a party across the hall from us keeping us up at all hours of the night with a small bed and a broken air system in the room we would have stayed at a 1 or 2 star motel/hotel. But, instead, we had opted to pay hundreds of dollars to stay in their \"Four Star\" hotel for only one night. There was no mention of taking anything off the bill or comping our stay.

Smart gamble it was indeed! The drawbacks were these: I was given the smallest room at the hotel, but it was still extremely comfortable for one and beautifully appointed to boot. There were no views as it faced buildings on both sides, but since I was only staying one night, I didn't care, and it was blissfully quiet. There was no dresser and thus no drawer space (although again, one night, who cares), the bathroom was small (but it was comfortable and had good amenities), and one of the two phones in the room didn't work. On the plus side was absolutely everything else. I arrived just before 11pm. The hotel was still fully staffed, and every single person that dealt with me, down to the room service attendent, was absolutely lovely. The restaurant had closed so I called for room service at 11:30. It arrived in less than 15 minutes, piping hot, and, surprisingly, was actually extremely good. The mini bar was well stocked, and a half bottle of a wonderful red wine that is one of my favorites at home was among the choices. The room was beautiful....almost like a small luxury hotel in Paris. The wireless internet worked perfectly even though the hotel only guaranteed wireless in the lobby. They graciously allowed me a late check out even though I was leaving on a Friday that was the start of a busy holiday weekend. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat....although I would choose a larger room if I were staying longer than a couple of days or if I were to be more than one person. Let me just reiiterate though that I was in the smallest room the hotel offers (because of my price choice) and that their average double rooms are probably more than comfortable for two. I liked everything about the Fairmont Copley....the location is perfect, the hotel itself is quite beautiful and has a lot of old world charm, and the staff are just terrific.

I stay at 4- and 5-star hotels about 10 nights of the year, and am a member of the Fairmont President's Club preferred guest program. Every interaction we had with a staff member was unimpressive, from the mumbling check-in person to the distracted check-out clerk. No doorman was on duty when we checked in, nobody offered to help with our bags, and the concierge was unable to answer basic questions about the immediate Copley area. The door to our Fairmont Room opened right onto the bed, with no vestibule or closet area to separate the room from the public hallway. The closet provided less than 12 inches of hanging space, and no trouser hangers at all. There were no drawers or shelves for clothing, anywhere in the room -- the whole armoire was taken up by the TV and minibar. There was no coffee in the room, although a notice in the minibar area said that we could have a pot and supplies delivered for an additional cost! The bathroom was minimal, with a shower over the tub surrounded by a fabric shower curtain (which, of course, blows in on you as you're trying to relax) and no robes. Toiletry amenities were basic but decent, and actually smelled pleasantly of citrus and herbs. But still, for a 4-star hotel, I expected a better setup. The TV in our room was malfunctioning, turning itself on at will. We tried to unplug it, but the armoire was too heavy to move. We turned down the volume, closed the doors, and threw the bedspread over the armoire to hide the light that was coming throught the door. The next morning, we asked the front desk to have it fixed. Maintenence left a note saying that the problem was resolved, but it wasn't -- we were awakened at 2am by the TV turning itself on at full volume! Needless to say, we weren't very happy the next morning. We left for our day out at about 8am, and left the \"please make up room\" sign on the door. When we returned, exhausted and ready for a shower, at 3:30pm, the room was still just as we left it. We called housekeeping, and the person who answered actually lectured us that we should KNOW that they have until 4pm to make up the room. (Are we psychic?) We asked them to send up towels so that we could shower; 30 minutes later, they hadn't arrived, so we called again. 20 minutes later, still no towels. I went out into the hall, found the abandoned maid's cart, and got them myself. The maid finally came to our door a few minutes later at 5pm, asking to make up the room. We told her that we'd like her to come back in an hour or so, after we left for dinner, and she sighed and stamped off. We took our shower, and came out to find a little \"sorry you didn't want your room made up\" notice slid under the door -- infuriating! When we called the front desk and explained what had happened, and asked them to please send someone up in 30 minutes to freshen the room, they gave us all kinds of flack, and finally agreed to only change the sheets and towels. The location on Compley Square is fabulous, and the bed was comfortable -- but those are just about the only things I can think of to recommend this hotel.

Nothing terrible, just not crisp as you would expect on a Concierge floor or at the Ritz/Four Seasons. But, the biggest issue was that I saw a mouse in the Oak Bar and also saw a mouse in my room! It was awful! I travel very frequently to city hotels and have never seen one in a hotel before! This would lead me to believe that they have cleanliness issues throughout the hotel and there were room service trays that stayed in the corridor for quite some time.

When I saw the rodent in the bar, I mentioned it to the waitress who basically shrugged her shoulders and said it is part of being in a big city...so I guess they had these complaints before.

I was promised by the reservation agent that I would have a wonderful stay at the Fairmont Copley. Well....reservations agents should not make promises. I have stayed there for four nights and have the following comments. I stayed in a duluxe double with a view of Copley Square. The only window in the very large room looked out over Copley was so small I could only see the Square when I was in the bed closest to that little window and leaned out to see. There was also a very large brown stain on the floor by a bed that had not been removed. They did just do a large renovation but the paint had already started to come off the ceiling above the shower curtain (that wouldn't fit around the whole shower ...brrrr) there are cracks in the paint around the crown moldings and the insides of the closet was old and tarnished from the wooden hangers hitting the wall a clothes were taken off. 1. Service: My resfreshment basket was totally empty for two days. On the third day the stocker came into my room while I was working on my laptop without knocking on the door and breezed into restock. At check out I noticed I had been charged very high amounts for the refreshment center though I had not used it (since there had been nothing in it). So either one of their employees is taking things and charging it to the customer, or the last customer who was there took everything from it when they left and then by the time the stocker came in to count what was missing a new customer (me) had been there for three days and was therefore charged! In some hotels I have seen a weighted system where as soon as someone grabs something from the basket or scale it will be changed to your room if not replaced within 60 seconds. (Wynn Hotel, Las Vegas) 2. On the last two nights of my stay a little mouse came right under my door (there is a two inch gap that allows hallway light or mice to get in) I called the front desk who seemed quite surprised and then a maintenence person decided to mosey on up a half and hour later. He then returned with traps with peanut butter and placed them next to my shoes in the closet and under the safe. So the mouse came back the next night to pay me a visit and didn't seem to pay the traps much bother. 3. Katie Copley the resident Black Lab does have a bit of an attitude (as reported in another one of your member surveys) and didn't really seem to care that I was trying to pet her. She just looked away. 4. Working in your room. I had a lot of work to be done which I thought could be done in the privacy of my room-yet during the day there seemed to be staff member after staff member coming in and out of the room (some not even knocking) like it was grand central. It was a very noisy environment to work in. The doors do not have spring hinges to keep the heavy OLD doors from slamming behind people as they come and go and the staff seem not to care about letting their customers sleep at night when noisy radios are blasting with security and housekeeping/staff are yelling back and forth to eachother in the hall while cleaning. 5. Compensation- I did complain about the mouse and the issue of the refreshment bar not being stocked, and me still getting charged for the whole basket and I was told that I would not be charged for the refreshment baskets, and would be given a nights stay and my phone calls would be taken off my bill. I felt this was nice. She also said that she would put me on preseidents level (which I think is open to all) so that was helpful and she was very pleasant. 6. As I have read comments from customer reviews and have stayed in now two Fairmonts (Hamilton Bermuda and Boston Copley and about to stay at the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal-but the reviews are awful) I am unsure as to whether or not I would be staying in a Fairmont again. There seems to be a constant problem with staff, customer service, cleanliness all for the amount of money people have to pay to be a part of a large and historic hotel company. The legacy aspect of this company seems to be lost in the big business of what seems to play a larger role in the Fairmont Legacy at this point. As big business becomes more and more important these days the historical legacy of an iconic hotel industry will soon be lost and it is the customers and the old hotels that are being forgotten.", "Date": "March 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "SarahMpls", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Excellent Location - Recommended\u201d", "Author": "SarahMpls", "ReviewID": "UR4471849", "Content": "This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in.

I had read various reviews and at the time the Fairmont had the least negative comments,that and it's ideal location prompted me to then find the best rate. I found a very reasonable rate on the hotel's website, although I had to prepay. Upon arrival I was informed that I was upgraded to a deluxe room :) Upon departure if you valet your car I would allow 15-20 min or so for them to retrieve it. In addition, when checking out the there may be a slight delay if many people are checking out at the same time so plan according. Call the bell captain 15-20 min (just to be on the safe side) before you leave if you need help with your luggage. If you are concerned about outside noise, I would recommend an interior room. It was so quiet- you wouldn't guess you were staying in downtown Boston. The rooms that face the street are on the T line, and there is quite a bit a traffic that passses buy so it tends to be a little loud. Just a comment on a previous review-The Oak Bar at the Fairmont is very popular so reservations would be a good idea. Also it is quite fancy so proper dress is suggested. eg. no jeans The location is great- CVS is right across the street, Starbucks and the Copley T stop (subway) is less than a block away. Here are a few of my favorite places if you need suggestions on places to go while you are in Boston. Fanueil Hall Houston's Naked Fish North End Mike's Pastry Modern Pastry (ricotta canoli- yum!!)

Dinner in the Oak Room was ok, but not spectacular and the table was too small for all the plates. Gave up on breakfast Sunday morning as it took 10 minutes for someone to take our names and to inform us of at least a 20 minute wait. Decamped to the Westin Copley Place and were seated at once.

The bathroom was exceptionally small (to the point where you couldn't really have any items on the sink, and it's tiny size could truly only accomodate one person). The shower was old and moldy...tile cracked in the bathroom...clearly not my idea of a \"recent renovation\". I'd comment on the view, but there was none. After a call to the front desk, we were upgraded to the \"Club-level\" which meant a slightly larger bathroom, and a larger room. As the bell-man let us into the room, we discovered 8 pillows lying in the middle of the room. Was there a party going on prior to our arrival? The room was very dusty, and clearly hadn't been used in a while. There was still smoke drifting in through the vents, but not as bad. The Club level breakfast is quite lame...a few muffins and bagels and fruit. Honestly, the setting was nice, but the food was not noteworthy. Upon leaving I was told I couldn't have a receipt for my room (as it was paid for on my Corporate Expedia account). I have never had that experience before - they are always more than happy to print off a receipt for me. Now that I am home, I just recently opened my Visa bill, and gues what - another separate charge of $385 in addition to my Expedia bill. I am curious to see how long it will take them to straighten that out.

We had booked a room upgrade, so were on the third floor overlooking the busy Dartmouth St. Being relatively high up meant that we were not disturbed by traffic noise, though - Boston drivers please note, your car will move without the horn sounding! What did disturb us though was the unasked for wake up call and the lack of apology for the mistake. Also, we were apparently below the hard floored club room, so noticed some heavy footsteps. Both complaints were well handled by the front of house management and, whilst a new room was offered, we didn't want to move. The room itself was very large and had comfortable seating, so beautiful for relaxing in after a long day walking the streets of Boston. The bed was vast and very soft - luxury. Again, the upgrade was worth it. The bathroom was a bit pokey and had no shelf space - strange in a luxury hotel. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel, but did enjoy their breakfasts.

The FCP has been recently renovated and our room was huge and had a wonderful bed, beautiful linens and a lovely marble bathroom. When we were leaving to go to the airport, the head doorman went WAY out of his way to call several taxi companies for us and get us a minivan cab - when one arrived he refused a tip and told us to tip the guy carrying the luggage instead. Also, they have an adorable black lab that is their canine ambassador - a nice touch to make people feel at home.

While we've stayed there often, this was our first visit to the new Gold Floor. Lots of hotel chains are now barking about their heavenly beds, well, no hotel I've been in holds a candle to the linens and bedding at the Fairmont. Really, I had flashbacks all the next day wishing I was back in the sack at the Fairmont. The hotel feels as if it was just totally renovated. Everything in the room was new and top quality. Time was, I used to feel insulted when I was given a room without a view, and our room this weekend was an interior room. but QUIET! It was like being way out in the country. No city noises at all. The gold floor has a great club kind of thing. It's about five different (all very elegant) sitting rooms with something for everyone -- fireplace, computers, butler's pantry, TV. whatever you're in the mood for. So often, there's not great value attached to \"club floors\", but the Fairmont is different. This premium is worth every penny.

Love Boston, and both times we went there we stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. The location is great, and the hotel is charming! We stayed on the Executive Floor, Fairmont Gold. It's on a private level, where there is kitchen with complimentary evening d'ouevres, honor bar, deluxe continental breakfast, computer services, comfortable lounge with a variety of dvd's and cd's. It completely exceeded our expectations. Also, you have your own concierge on that level that can help you with directions or anything you need. If you are looking to stay in Boston, you have to check out Fairmont Copley Plaza. There is also a fabulous lounge called Oak Bar, it is the nicest atmosphere to have a martini or appetizer. Stayed at the Copley Plaza prior, but staying on the Fairmont Gold floor was great. The room was also spacious, modern, comfortable and had various amenities. Boston is a great city, and we went there to see U2 in concert, and that was amazing.

Choosing the Fairmont Copley Plaza because of its excellent downtown location and proximity to the Amtrak station, (walking distance), we arrived at the Fairmont feeling chilly and less than elegant. Nevertheless, we were immediately swept into the warmth of the hotel by the excellent door personnel and after nary a request, shown to the Fairmont's Gold Level on the 4th floor. The hospitality there only exceeded what we had experienced on our arrival: superior concierge service, an extensive pantry of food and drink, including an honor bar, a warm fireplace, and best of all a spacious room with a completely furnished, but comfortably old- fashioned bathroom. Breakfast the next morning was worth paying for, but again it was complimentary. Kudos to the excellent management of this hotel, and all the thoughtfulness of its service personnel and excellence of design. We'll be back. Oh, yes, the price was fair and reasonable.

They value repeat customers. The Gold Floor was one of the best. The food was outstanding and we enjoyed every minute. We just came from the Toronto Fairmont Royal York and it was also very good. Be sure to take the Old Town Trolley Tour and hopefully you will get Karen as a driver and guide. She is terrific. You will have a great time and it is a good way to see the city. We only had two days and we saw a great deal. Ask the concierge for suggestions for restaurants. They are always great. Fairmonts usually have a loveable dog in residence that you can take for a walk if you like. Very nice added touch.

The meeting room had such rare convention-room architectural amenities as windows and columned arches, highly refreshing in a world of cookie-cutter ballrooms.

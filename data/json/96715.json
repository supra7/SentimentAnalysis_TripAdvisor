To take a shower, we had to wedge a coffee stirrer in the thing to keep it from flopping down. The handle on the door was broken off, so it was very hard to get out of the bathroom once you were finished doing your business. Because the room was handicapped, there was no \"lip\" on the shower floor to keep water from running out into the bathroom. So, when you took a shower- the floor gathered a bunch of water. While on the bathroom.....there were no shelves or counters to set your stuff. not sure why that was. Also, we only had 2 sets of towels and wash cloths and had to go get 3 more. (we had 5 in our party). I know this is a microtel, but the room was very small, and very ordinary. Mirrors across the entire back wall, made you think the room was bigger....but it definilty was \"micro\". Breakfast was a joke.

They couldn't give us adjacent rooms, though we were all on the same hallway--I felt bad for the patrons staying on either side of us, though the kids were pretty well-behaved. We also had to unexpectedly rent a suite so we could get an L of rooms that one chaperone could monitor--kind of an inconvenience. There's also no ball room, pool or common area, aside from the lobby, where we could gather the kids in one place away from the other patrons. The TVs were high up and didn't allow for DVD or video game hook-ups. Breakfast was plentiful, and the staff was very responsive with things like extra towels.

After the first night I noticed two little bites on my left hand, but attributed them to the small spiders that are found almost everywhere. The two subsequent mornings more appeared, but I was too busy sightseeing to pay them as much attention as they deserved. It was not until during my flight home after the third night that both arms began to itch badly, and having on a light jacket, I scratched without thinking. Upon arrival home late at night on Monday I took off my jacket to find both arms bloody from the scratching and covered with bites ranging in size from pencil lead to a dime. The following morning on the Internet I looked up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bug Bites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, discovering that mine matched exactly those shown for Bedbugs. The article further stated that one piece of evidence showing the presence of Bedbugs is small dots of blood on the sheets, which I had noticed after my second night at the hotel, but dismissed as being from the previous tenant, as it appeared that the sheets had been washed subsequently, although faint red dots were still visible. More bites appeared that day and for three days thereafter on my arms, chest, back, and buttocks, finally totaling more than 250 - but I dared not scratch in spite of the awful itching. Although I treated them with antibiotic and cortisone ointments, more bites continued to appear. It is well known that some insect bites (like many jellyfish stings such as the Thimble) do not manifest themselves immediately, but can take hours or even days to emerge. Finding online the Microtel Headquarters phone number for Customer Service, I called to report the problem at 3:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, but when told that none of the supervisors was available, I left a message for one of them on voice mail outlining my problem. That Friday, not having heard from Microtel, I called again at 3:00 PM EDT, to be told that all supervisors had already left for the weekend. The following Tuesday I received a letter from a supervisor whose theme was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely apologize that your expectations of Microtel Domestic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high standards of guest service were not met.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Upon reading this icy form letter (which was not even signed - just a typed signature), I immediately called the sender, who informed me that the hotel at which I had stayed was merely a franchise, and that I would have to deal directly with the owner (in Maryland with no 800 number) for any further action. When I told her this seemed unfair, she said she would have the franchise owner call me. It has now been two weeks since that conversation, with no word from him.

We called down to the front desk about this, and we were asked what type of air-con unit was in the room. Apparently, some of the rooms have a newer digital system, which ours did not.

The rooms tend to be just large enough for the basics. The rates being charged are modest, so don't expect a fitness room, lavish breakfast and room service at midnight. You can expect a clean, comfortable room and a hotel staff that is courteous and helpful. The floor coverings and wallpaper -- in the room and in the common areas -- were all in very good condition. While simple and somewhat neutral, they were pleasing and did not look cheap or gaudy. The building is an equal-length L shape. My room faced into the L and the parking lot. One out-of-the-L side faces Bertram Rd., which is a major road. It's possible that there could be some traffic noise, but I don't know personally. He lobby is small, but clean. There is a moderately sized breakfast area that also has a desk with a computer for Internet access. I did not use the machine because I brought my own laptop. The vending machines and ice machine are just off the lobby. My room measured 10' by 12' for the bed area, and 6' by 9' for the bathroom. There is a short entrance area (about 6' by 3') as well. This sounds small, but it's not cramped with a queen bed. Microtel hotels tend to follow the European room size idea. It's not a suite or a place to host a crowd. It's a bedroom, which is all I need. The room has an armoire to hang clothes, a desk area, night stands, and a window seat. There are two drawers and the air conditioner below the window seat. Overall, it's a very efficient use of the space. The window seat was actually a nice spot to sit in while I watched TV for a bit. My room was a non-smoking room. Each time I entered the room, I smelled some kind of air freshener aroma. It was sort of a sweet lemon scent. It was a somewhat odd scent, but it only took a minute to get used to it. There is wireless Internet access throughout the hotel. My room was at the end of the hallway, and the signal strength was very low. The connection speed was slower than typical high-speed access, and while the data rate was shown to be 54Mb/s, I think the combination of other users and the low signal resulted in the slower connection. For basic e-mail and a few small file transfers, it was fine. The free continental breakfast is the typical style at a budget hotel: juice, cold and hot cereal, bagels, muffins, coffee. The breakfast area was kept clean, despite the sloppy ways of many of the guests. The hotel provides a free shuttle to and from the airport. When I landed, I called the hotel to request a pickup. I waited for 30 minutes and the shuttle never arrived, so I called again. I was told that the shuttle was on the way. It arrived 10 minutes later. I asked the driver (Chris) about the delay, and he said that he was never told about my first call. That's one strike against the staff, but it's the only strike I experienced. Later, I was able to arrange a ride to Ft. Miflin with the shuttle, which made up for the pickup error. There are a Hampton Inn and a Fairfield Inn next door. The only restaurant in walking distance is a Ruby Tuesday. There is a Metro stop (Eastwick Station) a very short walk (five minutes) away. If the shuttle service is not to your liking, take the Metro to the airport. You can also take the Metro into downtown Philly. The Metro stop is a huge convenience for this hotel. This is a much longer review than I normally write, but I feel that this hotel is a great value in a pretty good location. Some other reviews gave this hotel low marks, but I disagree. I rarely give a full 5 rating (I save that for truly outstanding experiences), so don't confuse my 4 rating as being a problem. The Microtel Philadelphia Airport easily lives up to realistic expectations.

There is a Ruby Tuesdays within a couple of blocks (walkable); anything else would require driving. We left too early to have the continental breakfast, but the space looked OK, the coffee was fine. There is a computer with supposedly highspeed internet acess. It was dog-slow, so I'm not sure what the 'highspeed' was - slower than the slowest DSL, but faster than dial-up...maybe satellite?

Some people who stay here have no respect and yell and shout in their rooms or watch TV as if they were deaf.

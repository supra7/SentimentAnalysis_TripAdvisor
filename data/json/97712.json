Our room could have used the following repairs. Shower control worn out and not very controllable, broken dresser drawers, and hair dryer missing. We did not notice the dryer missing until my wife was out of the shower with wet hair. We read on the internet that all rooms are equipped with a hair dryer so she didn't think twice about it not being present. when we called the concierge we were told that we would have to come to their desk and get one. Now I am used to staying at less than 4 star hotels and I have never gotten this kind of treatment at so called budget hotels. The best thing for me at this hotel was that there is a penny slot machine directly in front of the go-go girls stage, and a Starbucks in the food court.

On arrival the check-in was fast and access to the rooms from reception to the elevators was quick (you dont have to walk through the casino like other hotels.) The room was a good size with a nice big bed and we had a view over the pool on the 29th floor, I think the bathroom was a little dated but clean. The hairdryer is hidden in the wardrobe by the way. There was a coffee machine (no milk) and bottles of water which get refreshed each day. It was an adjoining room, like others have said it can be really noisy which was a shame. The casino was fairly big, lots of slots and tables, maybe a little quieter than others and there is a definite perfume smell to mask the smoke. The \"street of dreams\" includes a few clothes shops, The Pub (good snack type meals) which has duelling pianos until midnight, a starbucks, yoghurt/crepe place, the cupcakery and the big chill serving slushy type drinks. This conveniently leads you to the Aria Express Tram which takes you directly to the Crystals shopping centre and the Bellagio. This was so handy, think we used it everyday! The hotel is also directly linked to the Aria casino. The food court was really great and so handy for a cheap coffee or a sandwich. They have another Starbucks, Subway, McDonalds, Rubio's, Manchu Wok, Sbarro and it looks like they are about to open a chicken place too. The Dragon Noodle place looked nice but pricey but Diablo's Cantina was cool- the Nacho's for a main meal are huge even if you share! The hotel is right next door to the NYNY hotel and also a CVS pharmacy store which was handy for snacks, beers and souvenirs. We didnt use the pool but it always looked quite busy/people having a good time as there is a lazy river and wave pool for use as well as good music playing. Check-out was slow, and like others have posted the resort fee of $15 a day seems a bit much for what you get back but this shouldnt deter you. Thought the hotel was a great choice for us because of the location, the useful tram and the food court. I would recommend to others and would be happy to return especially for the great price.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Casino and average room\u201d", "Author": "Melly44", "ReviewID": "UR126996911", "Content": "We loved the casino in this hotel - so many games to choose from and really good drink service for a strip hotel.

So much, that I was a bit concerned about staying here after I booked our room. (Then I saw what the Negative Nancys felt about Mandalay Bay, an awesome hotel, and was at ease). OK, it this place The Wynn or Caesar's Palace? No. But are you paying $300/nt to stay at the Monte Carlo? No. My wife and I stayed three nights over March Madness & St. Patrick's day. We arrived at 4 a.m. due to weather delays at our airport. The front desk staff were quick and courteous. We were given a room on a high floor, near the end of the hallway, with a view of the beautiful Aria hotel, all without asking for anything. Are the walls thin? A little. But I didn't wake up once due to noise from other rooms, and I am a light sleeper. I did hear a few people in the halls at night, drunk, coming back from clubs...but this is Vegas...I've experienced that at every hotel. The room was fine. No glass-walled shower like at Mandalay Bay or the newer Luxor towers, but if you want that, go pay the money to stay there. The bathroom was fine, the bed was nearly as comfortable as The Hotel at Mandaly Bay (my favorite place I've stayed in Vegas) and the rooms were cleaned every day by nice people. The poker room staff were great, courteous, and nice to my wife - who had never played poker before. Our blackjack dealer, a young man, was funny and courteous. And the craps workers were fun (we won some money there too). The only gambling staff downfall was that the sports book was not properly staffed in the mornings for the busy March Madness weekend...but I still had a great time visiting with the fun guests in the sportsbook. The casino is small enough where you don't lose anyone. The fast food shops are right near the hotel elevators in case you need a late night or early morning snack or a Starbucks. We had late night sushi & noodles at Dragon Noodle and the staff was great. (The sushi chef tipped us off about 1/2-off Sunday sushi too, but we couldn't make it back). Resort Fee: Do I like the resort fee? No. But the hotels that say they don't have a resort fee: like Paris or Caesars cost much more than the Monte Carlo. So avoid the resort fee by overpaying for a room you are hardly in (if you do Vegas right). Location: The location is great. We ate dinner and a champagne brunch at the Aria, which is connected to Monte Carlo. There is a CVS next door for necessities. And the entire Strip is within reach. In short, you can spend more money and stay at the Bellagio, Aria, or The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, and you would probably enjoy the rooms more. Or you can get a good deal, on a good hotel, with great location, with nice employees helping you out - and not whine about being too cheap to stay at one of those hotels - and enjoy your vacation!

The room was airy and clean, a few blemishes in the decor though nothing to put me off, the view though not of the strip included the New York, New York, the Luxor, the Excalibur, the Mandalay Bay and the mountains in the background. This was as a request for high view at a few pounds more. You can ask for a room with a view of the strip at a further minimal additional cost. The bathroom was also clean and the water was hot at all times, the cleaners were in every day and a couple of dollars tip and a little note seemed to do the trick with extra coffees and attention to detail. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Resort itself was very satisfactory with bars and restaurants around the casino, as well as a food court for cheaper options. Sitting at the slot machines we were always attended to for the free drinks by the waitresses which was not always the case in the other hotels. From the hotel here we could walk through to the Aria resort and Casino a huge modern complex with top end restaurants and shops, you can also catch a free tram to the Bellagio from the Monte Carlo, that gives access to Caesers Palace and therefore endless opportunities to see the city within 10 - 15 mins. Going in the other direction on foot to the New York New York is a five minute walk, that then gives you access to the the Excalibur, from there you can catch another free tram to the Luxor and the Mandalay bay. Across the road from there is the MGM Grand. So from the Monte Carlo you could see a lot of the major attractions within a short distance of time. Taxi's are always available out the front and to the top end of the strip ie The Stratosphere/Circus Circus you would be paying \u00a315. Resort fees at the end of the stay is something that you are made aware of when booking so no need to be surprised by them. Though dont forget to add tax. We booked when the fee was $15 dollars a night, they have recently gone up to $20 but when we pointed out the price on our booking they reverted to the original price without a problem.

Not overwhelming, but there is definitely a specific smell the Monte Carlo has. When you first walk in from outside it's a mixture of cheap cologne and axe bodyspray.

The pool is decent and we didnt have trouble finding chairs. The frozen drinks there were very good. Wave pool is small, but that wasn't a big deal to me. Hot tub and lazy river were up and running.

Additionally when we were there we found out that 1. The Pool was closed for maintenance, and 2.

Since the hotel was quite full, they could not accomodate us in another room until the next day after people had checked out. When we went to front desk the next day they were kind about it and returned 2 days of resort fees. We wanted a mini fridge in our new room so they gave that to us for free for our troubles. We didn't get to use the pool as it was closed for the season which kind of sucked since it was quite warm the week we were there. Once we changed rooms on day two we had a few issues. The heat was very tempremental in the second room. It was either too hot or too cold all the time. We couldn't seem to find a happy medium to keep the room at a neutral temperature, so it was a week of constant changing the thermostate up and down. We did have to ask housekeeping for things such as water, coffee or sugar but they were more than happy to provide it to us and were super friendly. A few days in I noticed some marks on my arm, and on the second last day my cousin also woke up with a few bumps that to us looked like bites. Upon check out they returned the remainder of my resort fees and had an outside company come and inspect the room in case there were bed bug or anything else. They took our number to let us know before we flew out as if there were anything they didn't want us taking them home with us in our luggage. Luckily there was nothing found and they said it may be from the harsh detergents they use to clean the linens. We also found the water to be quite harsh on our skin. We both found our skin completely dried out despite the amount of moisturizer we put on our skin. The location of the hotel was decent but not ideal but you get what you pay for and that was reasonable to us. One very good thing I can say is that the beds are so comfortable!!! There were days where we felt like we didn't want to get out of our beds its was so comfortable. We ate once at the buffet, once at the cafe and a couple of times in the food court. We went to the buffet on the Friday night which was their seafood/international night. It was more expensive that night and definitely not worth the money. We were just too hungry that night to go anywhere else. The food at the Cafe was amazing. We absolutely loved it and the portions were quite large.

The position of the hotel is fantastic on the strip - and is great value given its good standards and overall surroundings.

I booked the Monte Carlo through expedia for a very good price, including 2 free Cirque tickets (we wound up seeing LOVE and it was amazing!). I chose the Monte Carlo because it was very affordable, it didn't look scary, and it is a decent location on the strip, catty-corner to the MGM Grand. We've been to Vegas a few times before, and sometimes we like to stay at a slightly higher-end hotel; the reason we didn't stay at Paris or the Venetian was because we were travelling as a group and had to be more economical. So Monte Carlo was perfect for our needs. All in all, we were pretty pleased. We met 3 friends there, and they all felt like it was a very nice hotel, and we've all agreed that should we do a Vegas trip again, the Monte Carlo is definitely one of the places we would consider. Our room was clean, well furnished, and decent sized. Only real complaint is we asked for a single bed (a Q or a K, we didn't care) and we got two fulls. We didn't spring for anything fancy, like a suite or anything. Our view was kinda cool, though--we had a nice view of the spectacle that is the new Aria next door, and it looked amazing. We had the breakfast buffet and it was very good (bottomless mimosas, FTW!); we tried to eat at Brand, the nice restaurant, but we left after half an hour, because we hadn't even gotten water yet and it was an empty restaurant. Diablo, the Mexican place, was great though! Good seafood, and a gargantuan margarita that is guaranteed to make Vegas all the more fun. :-D The gambling was fun. We took up a whole blackjack table, and had a very amiable dealer who laughed and joked with us. My husband and I mainly occupied the nickel and penny slots though, and it was rare that we had to go get our own drink. They even take care of the penny players! Sidenote: we took a walk down the strip one night and hung out in the Venetian for a bit. Not only did we never get a drink on the gambling floor, we only saw about 2 or 3 waitresses. Just an observation. My best friend and I enjoyed an afternoon by the pool, and that was a lot of fun. They have PLENTY of lounge chairs, pool waiter service, and 3 different pools. I loved the wave pool, and the lazy river was fun too. There was also a dj playing loud music and it was fun to just drink, hang out in the pool, and act silly. The one drawback to the pool area is it is CROWDED. The lazy river in particular was crowded--there were a few traffic jams. But what do you expect? It's freakin' Vegas, and everyone's supposed to party and have a great time. My final comments on the hotel: check-in/out was easy-peasy, and the hotel was very easy to find your way around. Drink service was great on the gambling floor, but in other areas it wasn't great.

Housekeeping was great- they would give us extra waters and coffees when requested and kept the room clean. Monte Carlo is a smaller resort, in a good location on the strip. Our one complaint here, would be that the M Life Players Cards dont work most of the time. We arent big gamblers, so didnt expect to get any real comps by using them, but they worked so seldom in the slot machines that we just quit using them at any of the M Resorts. OK, our other complaint would be the resort fees- they pay for nothing! However, they took off $ 5.00 a day because when we reserved, the resort fees were only $15.00. It was nice to have inexpensive fast food restaurants in the hotel, where you could just grab a bite to eat before going to an early morning tour or on the run.

Some of the reasons we returned to this hotel over choosing another hotel - location on the strip very good, use of monorail between some hotels. Car park is not a million miles away from your room/reception as it is with some hotels. Access to your room from the car park good, again you do not have to trail through a shopping mall or casino to get to your room. There are lots of hotels to choose from on the strip, and the Monte Carlo is not one of the newest, therefore does not have ultra modern rooms. The rooms however are functional and practical and of a good size. We did pay for a high floor room, and whilst we got the high floor, there was no other benefit, the room was the same as the one we had the previous year on floor 5. There are a few signs of wear and tear, but we were out all day every day that this did not matter to us. The hotel does have seperate lists depending on what floor you are on, and this does help at peak times. You can use the internet at reception to check in, they have now blocked the internet to only show the airline sites, you cannot access the internet from here. This was available the previous year as I was able to print off discount coupons. The hotel has a mexican restaurant which is good, but the service on our last visit was not brilliant, and do note it does close in the run up to Christmas. I had made a reservation on opentable about 4 months before our visit, only to receive a cancellation notice a couple of weeks before our arrival to say the restaurant would not be open. Hiring a car is a must if you want to get out and about and see some of the sites. We got up early when the strip was nice and quiet and went for a walk. Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood is fab, and highly recommended, as is PF Chang's the chinese restaurant. Get to the malls early if you can before they get mega busy especially at holiday times. Food in the Monte Carlo buffet restaurant was OK. Its not expensive as some, and perhaps does not have such a huge selection, but there is plenty to eat, and it does generally offer good value for money.

Overall our stay was good but we had enough little problems that it became annoying. We originally booked a Monaco Suite and requested a strip view. When we arrived there were no high floor strip view rooms available so they offered a 3rd floor Monaco Suite instead. I was not willing to accept this so they offered a mountain view on the 22nd floor but said they would call the next day when a strip view opened up so we could move. O.K. fine one night I could live with. After a few trips back and forth to the front desk for key cards that would not work we finnaly got settled in. The mountain view was actually a view of the freeway and In N Out Burger! Not what I had in mind for a Vegas view but waited patiently for the call to be moved to a better room. 24 hours later still no call so back to the front desk again to stand in the long lines waiting to see what the deal was. Apparently nothing opened up so they just decided to not even bother calling us. I told them I was not too happy with how things have been going so far and requested an upgrade to a better room. After the front desk talked to manager they offered to put us in a Spa Suite on the 24th floor with a Strip View. Finally we could relax and enjoy our stay!! The Spa Suite we stayed in was incredible and much better than the Monaco Suite we were in the first night. The Spa Suite we were in looked to be recently updated and was in great shape. (I posted photos in the pic section) We loved the view and sitting in the spa overlooking the strip lights was awesome. The shower was tiled, enclosed in glass and very huge. We also had a nice bar area with sink along with a stereo, refrigerator, and coffee maker. Everything we needed except for maybe a microwave. Pros.... Great value for what you get in a room. Location is perfect and in the middle of all of main action on the strip. Beds and pillows are by far the most comfortable I have ever had in a motel room. We didn't gamble much but loved the casino. Not so large like some of the others and not so smoky. Although there is a strong smell of perfume which did not bother me. The place is very clean and organized. Everybody we dealt with that worked there was extremely friendly and helpful. Had free WIFI everywhere on the property. (part of resort fee I assume) There was a wide range of food options on the property. Subway, McDonalds, Sbaro Pizza, Starbucks and a few others if you want cheaper options. We thought the buffet was pretty good for the price, the Cafe was excellent. Heard good things about Diablo's Cantina, Brand Steakhouse and Dragon Noodle Chinese restaurant but didn't get a chance to eat there. Avis car rental desk onsite. Was very easy to rent a car for a day if you choose. Cons... Our 3rd night there after a very late night we were woken up from a dead sleep very early in the morning by what sounded like a hammer pounding on the wall above our bed and shortly after very loud speaking in spanish and very excessive noise from the next room. Contacted front desk and they apologized after telling us workers were replacing carpet in that room. I stressed my displeasure with this and made it very clear I was not happy. They offered to remove my resort fee for 2 nights which I accepted since workers were done that same day anyway. Walls are very thin especially if you have an adjoining door the the next room. The last two nights of our stay a family with at least one very young child moved into that same room. The kid was constantly screaming and the adults had to be the noisiest most inconsiderate people I have ever heard. Absolutely no respect for others. Never could understand why people bring young children to Vegas. Good thing we had a stereo in the room to drown them out. At this point we only had one more night so I didn't bother to complain since they were quiet after 10:00 P.M. Avoid d.vino for Italian food. We ate there our first night there. Spent $60 for two and were not pleased with the quality. Spaghetti was the worst I ever had. Chicken Parmesan was very dry. Other than a few problems we actually really enjoyed our stay. I know that sounded like way too many problems but they were more than willing to work with us to compensate us in some way. These are the details they need to improve on and if they do it will make this a much better place to stay.

Just a bed and bath. The pictures they show you online are there \"upgraded rooms,\" which are not much better. So, I was not going to stay in this creepy room with the CSI spot on the wall. So back to the mile-long front desk we went to negotiate a new room. Of course they did not have another room for us. Like in this huge hotel they did not have even one room available. So we ask to talk to the manager. After declaring that we were not staying in that room he \"found\" another room. It was the last room down an endless hallway. We got quite the workout; sometimes we just stayed in the room because it was too far of a walk to leave. This room was not much better, except that it did have some chairs. They were willing to roll in a frig. More like a low end motel than a big resort. And at check out we were hit with the hidden resort fees.

I will NEVER go back. Not only was there cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE, I was completely disgusted by our first next door neighbors. After waking up at 4 a.m. to yelling, door slamming and very obviously low-class drunks who were smoking on a non-smoking floor (doesn't anyone follow rules in Vegas?) I called down to the front desk. They said they would send security. Never heard them come though. Somewhat quieter, but still door slamming and talking VERY loudly. Their guests must have left so our neighbors could have their quickie, as then I heard 'noises' and 'oh babe' clear as a bell. I thought, good maybe they will go to sleep. Nope. The friends came back, they lit up again (the smoke was coming through the vent in the room). At this point I had called the front desk twice and spoke to security once. I called down and they did not answer the phone for likely 20 rings. I am sure deliberately. Finally I asked them to send security to my room to smell the smoke and hear the commotion. Finally they listened to this set of guys (they were huge!), However, I never did get back to sleep. The front desk gal was so not into her job. She could care less. I guess jaded from the constant complaints and noise that very obviously exist in this hotel. She said sorry once (the last call) and never said anything about any compensation. I had to ask to be moved. When I moved the next day, the front desk staff was great - they waived the resort fee for the entire stay. When we were moved to another floor, there were people smoking by the elevators right by the sign that said \"Non-Smoking Floor\". Rules I guess are just meant to be broken. I think Vegas is for people who want to lose their heads, their money, their self-respect and drink their faces off. It is a city of overindulgence at every corner. On a slightly more positive note, I thought the food in the Cafe was great. That's about it. The room was cleaned somewhat as in fresh towels and the bed made, but the maid kept leaving the two used glasses on the sink. Not sure why. We had room service one night and the person who brought it up was very nice and professional.

Turns out they charged the resort fee that day for the entire stay and it was $20, not $15 as Expedia said. All that covered was wired internet and use of the gym. We also got 'complimentary' water each day which we had to remind housekeeping about several times. There were no robes or slippers or nice bathroom amenities with the room, like Bellagio or Mandalay Bay, which we have stayed at before. They also did not leave $50 open on the card so we didn't have access to movies or to charge anything to the room. Housekeeping basically remade the bed- they didn't clean much in the bathroom and like I said before we had to remind them for the water. Room was ok- not terrible but did need some upgrading. The toilet was extremely loud when flushed and walls were thin so we could hear the young kids waking up at 6am every morning (by the way- why are people bringing so many kids to Vegas these days???) Got a massage at the spa which was not so great- she was very fast and it wasn't very relaxing. The whirlpool and steam rooms were ok but didn't compare to other spas on the strip. Definitely small and in need of upgrades. Tried to print boarding passes from the computers in the lobby but printer was out of paper and had to wait for someone from the busy front desk to refill.

Our room faced the pool, we heard the music from bed, and the party started. We headed down to the pool and had one of our best days ever! Get there early to get the lounge chairs. By noon, most are taken. See our photos of the pool scene from our room before it got too crowded down there. The hotel had a crew come in and set up a foam pool on their resort beach and we found our place in the suds...slipping and sliding all over with the mainly 20\u2019s party crowd. Then the wave pool....dancers and DJ...great! We could not believe that people brought children here! Later, we rented tubes and floated the lazy river around and around, music blasting; crowd dancing, bodies rubbing, tons of bikinis, electric atmosphere. This was we wanted to see at a Vegas hotel on Memorial Day Weekend and they did not let us down. By Monday, we did not want to go home, needed more pool time, so we purchased a half-day till 5 PM in the room for a reasonable price. Room Review: It\u2019s rated at 4 stars, but really it\u2019s a 3 star room and 4 stars for the extensive resort facilities. Don't expect anything more than a 3 from the room unless they update it. Towels, soap, etc. all 3 stars. But we weren\u2019t in Vegas to hang in the room--we were out and about. Area: Very convenient to everything. You are next to the Aria, NY NY, MGM, and a tram that takes you to Bellagio. We trammed and walked it wherever we wanted to go. Food: With the exception of Subway in the Hotel, we did not eat there. (BTW: a Subway Sub is 2x normal price=$10.00=Vegas Hotel high prices!) Parking: Free Self-Parking easy as can be. Park in the large covered garage and walk the causeway into the lobby. We did not move the car for 3 days. Gambling: Who knows! We were having so much fun, that we forgot to gamble. Only things we did not like: They would not let us bring food or water to the pool area. We had to sneak it. (Don't tell them! LOL).", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAverage accommodations\u201d", "Author": "happynwtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR125002537", "Content": "Cost was too high for the accommodations or service.

The air condition in the room would blow cold air but would not cool the room down below 70F. After several looks by maintenence we were told everything was working fine. The front desk went as far to tell me to change the setting from 60F to 70F because sometimes by setting it warm it will cool the room better. Figure that one out? The room had a wet bar with cabinets that were falling on the hinges and would not close correctly. The carpets in the room were stained very badly, to the point you didnt feel comfortable walking around with out shoes on. After several talks with the front desk we finally decided to stop spending money on upgrade charges and went back to the deluxe room.

One of the least appealing aspects of our stay was the $15 +tax daily \"resort\" fee, which appears to include use of the swimming pools, fitness center, and WiFi. As it is winter, none of the hotel's swimming pools were open. $15 +tax is a steep price to pay for daily internet access. Another negative feature is the lack of an organized queue at registration and check-out, resulting in a free-for-all. When questioned about this, the front desk associate said that a roped off queue would make the lobby unattractive.

Our group included 35 women. Our base group rates were probably not that different from what you can get just booking online; however for a group they did include the expensive daily resort fee and high room taxes so we had substantial savings there. We each shared queen rooms (doubles) and our group leader had a room attached to a hospitality suite which we all used between outings and activities. Our room was was pretty basic with 2 queens on the 18th floor. The beds were comfortable and the housekeeping staff member that serviced our room went above and beyond the call of duty to keep our room clean and well stocked with coffee and toiletries and replacement towels. The check-in and out staff were also helpful and efficient. There are a lot of choices for in-hotel eating. I had Moo Shu Chicken at the Dragon Noodle Restaurant off the Casino and it was quite good. I also tried the Slider Burgers and Onion Rings and an imported pint of beer at The Pub Restaurant and found the food to just be so-so and it took nearly a half hour for them to seat me even though there were plenty of open tables - so I'm not sure they are managed very well. The Slider buns were pretty mealy and overall I wished I had gone some place else. There are several other restaurants including the usual Vegas buffet, but I did not have time to try any of them. I did get a slice of pizza one day at the Sbarro fast food joint in the hotel's \"Food Court\" and it was okay. Had no luck whatsoever in the Casino and the facility itself was simply a disappointment. The machines seem old, and even me, a smoker, found the ventilation really poor and the air quality stinky. The staff were friendly enough and drinks are complimentary if you are working a slot machine or playing cards. The location of the Monte Carlo is quite good - it is located toward the southern end of the \"Strip\" north of MGM and just south of New York New York. Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is across and down the street and walking distance and the Crystals shopping mall is just a block or so away. I did not shop there, but one of the gals in our group really enjoyed that mall which includes super high-end stores like Louis Vuitton as well as a Macys. Best of all you have a CVS (with a Chase ATM inside it) immediately to the south on the Strip and you have a Walgreens directly across the street. Both drugstores sell alcohol and wine and all kinds of sandwiches and food products in addition to the usual things you might find in your local chain drugstores. The only serious downside to the Monte Carlo, is that the rooms are not well sound-proofed. You can hear hallway and room next door sounds pretty well. When they refurbish the place in the future I hope they will address this problem. It wasn't so bad that it interfered with my sleep, but it was noticeable on and off during the days and evenings. When you visit Vegas and especially if you do not rent a car (and I'm glad I did not after seeing all of the continuous Strip traffic!) you really need to consider what is within reasonable walking distance to your hotel; otherwise you will be running up a substantial taxi bill.

Considering I come to Vegas at least 3 times per year, it's not a remarkable property. But I do like it, in a pleased and benignly unexcited way. The Monte Carlo has a few good things going for it, particularly its location, and its pricepoint. Yes, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The decor is typical, unobtrusive hotel decor: off-white wall paper, beige carpet, granite countertops, brass fixtures. This time 'round, we styaed in a spa suite. Bed was comfy. Television was a 42\" Samsung flat panel (like I have at home) carrying the usual blend of cable channels. The spa tub was right next to the window with a view of the mountains. The spa warmed quickly, and was large enough for two reasonably-size American adults, or four children, or one obese person under 250kgs. The room was a broad, open space equipped with a wet bar, kitchen sink and a mini-fridge. There was a living room area with sofa and coffee table, the bed, and the spa tub. No partitions in between. Monte Carlo is located next to the new Crystals at City Centre and Aria. There is a tram connecting Monte Carlo to City Centre to Bellagio. The tram is a great convenience because the Monte Carlo itself doesn't have the most exciting amenities. No hot nightclub. No celebrity chef restaurant. Mediocre shopping options. To get the great stuff, you have to step outside. But that's fine because you can pay less for a good room and still reap the rewards of those New Hotness properties. Service at the Monte Carlo is very good. There was a delay in my room check-in, so the front desk compensated me with waived resort fees and complimentary late check-out.

The hotel lineup was long (30 minutes) with several empty computer stations but only a few staff members. Our room, upon arriving to it after a long walk, was nothing impressive with no microwave, no fridge, and obvious stains on the sheets right on top for all to see. We went to the front desk to complain about the stained sheets and asked for them to be changed. They apologized, assured they'd be changed and removed the daily \"resort fee\" from our bill. After a long flight and wait to get settled in, we searched for food. After wandering about the strong-smelling hotel which was a combination of 30-year old cigarette smoke and overpowering cheap air freshener, we discovered that all restaurants in the hotel stopped serving food after 9 pm and no one would suggest any places we could eat at. We went to the concierge desk to ask for suggestions, but they too were closed at 9pm. The city that never sleeps my [--]. We wandered the strip to find overpriced food and drinks. Do not get suckered into visiting the hotel's club \"Brand\" - it is a ripoff. They offered wristbands to the ladies for \"free drinks\" which turned out not to be free when they finally get you roped into the line checking your id's and they want $20 cover charge. The boys got in for $10 each but they bought their \"deal\" of bottle service - a tiny bottle of disgusting Skyy vodka, some mix, and a table - all for the cheap price of $140 when the same bottle and mix cost $30 from the hotel lobby store. The very second you finish your bottle, the staff rush to take your mix and cups away regardless of whether you've finished with them or not. We returned to our rooms at 1 am to find our sheets had not been changed as requested. Returned downstairs to talk to front desk again. They apologized again, claiming they only had 1 housekeeper on duty and we need to give her 15 minutes to change the sheets. We walked around some more, gave her a good 1/2 hour before returning to the room, and she was still in our room but just finishing up. So exhausted, we fell into bed and didn't notice until the next morning the \"new\" sheets also had nasty stains on them. The shower drain wouldn't drain worth sh!t and while showering, the tub would fill up with dirty water. Gross. I called front desk this time to complain about dirty sheets and disfunctional bathtub drain. I waited a half hour and got put on hold, transferred to the manager several times. After repeating my story again and again, we were given a new room and waited another 20 minutes for someone to bring us new key cards. In our new room with a worse view than the first, the safe didn't work, but we'd given up on trying to get decent service. Also, there was someone else's trash in the garbage bin that wasn't changed from the previous visitors. After a few hours in that hotel lobby/casino/restaurant areas, my nose and sinuses felt raw from the stench and accepted a persistent headache. All other hotels we visited did have a slightly noticeable smoke/air freshener smell, but the Monte Carlo was obnoxiously offensive. Our rooms were outdated and worn. Simple amenities and service were hard to come by. Accessibility to places were far away and you had to walk everywhere - not client friendly at all. Drinks at any bar seemed excessively priced, except at the Pub one night where Bud light was on a good deal. The best experience was one late night, I ordered overpriced room service. The sweet man who brought it up must have felt bad knowing they were charging me $15 for Special K cereal and strawberries - and I only ordered for \"one\" person as they have an extra charge for each individual. Knowing there were 2 people staying in the room, he included 2 milks, 2 servings of cereal and a generous bowl of fresh cut strawberries. We were appreciative. The king sized bed was very comfortable however and there was plenty of space in our room - for some positive points. I would NOT stay in this hotel again. From what I saw, other hotels on the strip of similar, less and more pricey levels all seemed better than the Monte Carlo. For my first trip to Vegas, I was quite disappointed.

The casino is good, rooms are average and the wait for elevators is not very long. The food court inside is actually really good -- subway, starbucks, manchu wok, rubio's and mcdonalds. The best thing about this hotel is its location! Pretty darn close to the middle. I had a couple issues with our room (on the 23rd floor): First, the shower head was really really strong and we couldn't adjust it. Second, I couldn't find the hair dryer until I asked and they said it was in the closet on the top shelf (which I didn't even notice). Third, when people knocked on the doors beside us, we kept thinking that it was our door. The tvs in the rooms are newer flat screens and that's probably the nicest thing in the room. We also had to request a mini fridge, which was wheeled to our room. The casino is pretty good - all the latest slot machines and lots of tables. My only issue was that it was VERY smokey inside. I've never gone during January before, and I think because the heat was on, there was a little less air circulation. I have asthma, so I couldn't stay in the casino for more than an hour without starting to cough a lot. We did go to other hotels and they were a lot less smokey, but you could still smell it. Overall, I would probably stay here again, since it's pretty cheap.

The Casino itself is less crowded than the bigger casinos which is great because its easier to get around and the staff have time to talk you through how each game works if you've never played before. I guess the bigger casinos provide more atmosphere, but you're never far from them. MC is far enough down the strip that its not absolute chaos as soon as you step outside - but its only a moments walk from the chaos. This meant it was never an effort for us to get in amongst all the excitement that vegas has to offer, but we also had somewhere we could retreat to, where the restaurants and shops weren't overcrowded all the time. While I stayed here with a mate, we had two friends staying at the Bellagio and another staying at Caesar's Palace - and I've got to tell you, MC is a lot less crowded than the more notorious Casino Resorts. This is handy at times - for example when you feel like hitting the pool. The Bellagio was always overflowing with bodies, but the pool at the MC gave us a chance to relax in and by the pool without worrying about jumping into a sea of bodies and having our bannana lounges immediately poached.

Unfortunately, I was already booked through a soccer tournament and couldn't change my reservations. We arrived on Friday night at 11:00 PM and still waited a half hour to check in. The next morning and throughout my 4 day stay there were always ridiculously long lines, (20+ people per line), and many empty check in stations that could have been staffed and helping customers. My room was clean, but as mentioned in the other reviews, looked plain, and did not have a refrigerator or microwave. There were plenty of towels and the room was average in size. I did not have any issues waiting for the elevator. The elevator lobby is right next to the Casino and you will be smelling the smoke. There is a \"long\" route to the food court, but it is just as easy to cut through the casino and again, you will smell like smoke. The smell in the lobby and throughout the hotel that a few reviewers complained about was obvious. I did not find it unpleasant, but if you are sensitive to smells or have sinus issues then you will be affected and it will probably give you a head ache. The food court was great! They have Chinese, Rubio's, McDonalds, and two other places that are of that caliber. It was open all night and the prices were higher than a regular fast food, but cheaper than room service. The Cafe was awful. It is outdated, smoking is allowed, and the food is terrible. Everything is made with margarine and the toast was so stale that I nearly chipped a tooth. I had egg beaters with cheese and veges. I could only swallow 2 bites. It will cost you about 30 bucks for breakfast for two. We went to McDonalds and bought breakfast sandwiches. The sports pub was good. The drinks were pricey, but the food was reasonable. The Ahi tuna salad was excellent and the hot wings were good as well. The weekend Piano Duel show isn't very good. The pregnant piano lady is a horrible singer and most of our group ignored the show. The casino is a bit pricey and very smokey. For the money I preferred to go to the Aria or other nearby casinos. There is a tram that connects the Monte Carlo, the Aria and Bellagio. This will cut down on walking to each of these casino's, (they are worth the trip), but you will still need to wear sensible shoes as there are a ton of stairs to and from the tram. Our comforters were not changed from the previous guests and there was a strong smell of cologne on both of them. I asked the manager downstairs, (after waiting in a long line), if they could be swapped out. The comforter and sheets were swapped out. I am not sure what was on the sheets, but that night any part of my skin that touched the sheets was broken out in hives. I am not allergic or sensitive to laundry soap, and this was a severe reaction. I had no reaction to the sheets that I had slept on the night before. I showed the manager the reaction and requested a change of sheets again. Housekeeping came upstairs with new sheets but threw them on the bed and left them for me to change. I stripped the bed and slept on the mattress cover and used a blanket I had packed. I didn't have anymore hives, so I am still attributing the severe breakout to something either put on the sheets or what the sheets were washed with. If you have sensitive skin, you will be miserable at this hotel. I didn't understand the resort fee or the spa fee, but after checking in, it was made very apparent. There is an extra 16.95 per day added onto your hotel rate. In addition, if you want to use the gym or spa you must pay 18 dollars a day per person as well. Add 40 dollars a day per person to your room rate when you are booking the hotel. Overall, the hotel is outdated, smoky and not worth the price.

This is something of a problem if you want to keep anything chilled. Also there were a few tiles missing in our bathroom which made the whole room feel really dated. The walls are also extremely thin. The hotel was clean and the staff is pretty friendly although I did waste something on my comforter the first day and it was never changed the whole time of my stay. That was just a little unnerving, and made me wonder what else they don't change.... The hotel buffet was also pretty decent.

His girlfriend got us the room for a great deal off one of the travel websites. It was such a quick cab ride from the airport. It probably was faster getting there than waiting in the cab line... Check in was a breeze and we were allowed to check in early. It was a nice, clean room, and that's all you need since you're hardly in the room at all. We went to check out City Center right after since we heard that was the new thing in town and we took the free, quick tram over. We weren't impressed and decided to walk back to the hotel to get started on the gambling. The hotel is close to all of that so it didn't take long. As far as the gambling, there were always open tables and for the most part friendly dealers. The drink service was pretty good at night, but a little relaxed during the day. The biggest disappointment with the hotel was the Cafe/Diner. We went twice...the first time, during happy hour, they only had one server for the whole place and that we'd have to wait 20 minutes. Why have only one server during happy hour? That didn't make sense so we left and went to the \"Pub\" in the hotel. They served a good burger and good beers so that was nice. We decided to try the Cafe/Diner for breakfast the next day to see if we can get a seat without having to wait. We were seated within minutes, which was good, but the waitress took forever to take our order and after she took it, it took more than 30 minutes to get our food. People that came after us, got their food before we did. And when we got our food, it wasn't as described and the portions were small for the price they charged. We did talk to the manager and he comped us 30% which was nice, but don't bother going here.

I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay, MGM, Mirage and the Stratosphere during past trips. While my room rate was $80 or so less per night than I've paid at more glamorous Sin City digs, the service and room condition was far less. - My room reservation was to have included a $35 credit that could be applied against a dining experience at the Monte Carlo. SHAME on me for not reading the fine print . . . the wonderful Andre's restaurant that I had so looked forward to visiting was NOT included in this package. My plans were to eat at the highly recommended Andre's and come under the business per diem with the $35 gimmee - Oh Well. - Last Monday night strong storms moved through the Southeast. After taxiing for two full hours around Charlotte waiting for FAA landing clearance, I obviously missed my connecting flight to Vegas and arrived well after midnight instead of the planned 7:15 schedule. I waited for a short time to check-in and receive my key and headed up to the 25th floor for my room. The key didn't work. I returned to the registration desk and received an apology and a key for a different room? Upon entering this room, it was clearly occupied with an unmade bed, toiletries in the bathroom and thankfully guests that were out on the town. Back to the front desk expecting a huge room upgrade and was sent to the 30th floor where I collapsed and quickly fell to sleep. - Room 3 on the 30th floor was certainly nothing special. My pictures will show a mirror in the bathroom that had come loose and was reattached a few inches over leaving holes in the wallpaper and wall. - I frankly thought my window was broken at first and then realized a large swath of the windowfilm tint had torn away from the outside. On a positive note, I asked for my luggage to be stored a few hours after check-out and the Bell Captain was very helpful and courteous. Likewise, the same young man that coordinated the taxi line greeted everyone with a warm good morning and helped me with bags that I was carrying. If you stay at this hotel, you will be impressed with the Brand Steakhouse; I enjoyed a terrific meal and applied the aforementioned $35 coupon which was accurately credited against my room bill. I think this hotel is showing a few seams. (I'd be curious to know whether my Expedia reservation had something to do with the poor room and dismal view?)

Now that may not have been the desk clerk\u2019s fault, but somebody like that needs to be sent somewhere else if they are that obstinate. Last year we had a Spa Suite on the 30th floor, it was an AWESOME room. It had a steam shower, and plenty of room. (There was a large gap between the foot of the bed and the sofa) In the room this year, (on the 25th floor) there was NO steam shower, not nearly as much room between the bed and the sofa, etc\u2026 The thermostat was not accurate. We had it set in the 60\u2019s (on the AC setting) and the room NEVER got really cool. The lighting in the \u201cstool\u201d section of the bathroom was VERY inadequate. (I think a bic lighter would furnish more light!) The sink in the wet bar was slow and made a lot of noise. There was NO stereo system (like the room on the 30th floor last year. The most aggravating thing about this whole trip was the \u201cResort fee\u201d\u2026what an [--] joke that is!! $15 a night added on to your bill (NO CHOICE!) for basically NOTHING! You can tell the front desk staff, as well as the concierge staff is well prepared to defend that charge. (Even if they don\u2019t agree with it!) I was told that \u201cpart\u201d of that was internet access (wired in the room). They had wireless in the room last year! And use of the computer / printer downstairs to print your boarding passes.

Most of my trip I can\u2019t share with you and it has to \u201cstay there\u201d, but I can share with you that if you want a clean, nice hotel on the strip... The Monte Carlo is for you. I have stayed at the Monte Carlo at least twice a year for year for the past 5 years and have never been disappointed. I have gone with my son, my girlfriends, and by myself and have always had an enjoyable time. If you book directly from the Hotel's Website you just can't beat the prices, which are always some of the least expensive on the strip. There are a few hotels for less money, but be careful with those, they are usually dirty, un-kept, old and run down. The Mpnte Carol is always clean and well taken care of. The furniture is older, but not outdated or trashed. The linens always look brand spanking new, well pressed and clean and what a great matress... I sleep like a baby. If you are looking for a grandiose hotel with lots of pretense situated on the strip, then the Monte Carlo is NOT for you. At the Monte Carlo, you can actually walk less than 100 steps from the front desk to the guest room elevators, without hiking across a humongous casino or needing a golf cart to keep your feet from hurting. The Casino is large but not expansive where you get lost and the tables are comfortable. All employees seem sincere to have you as a guest. The hotel is situated towards the south end of the strip, but conveniently located walking distance for lots to do. If you want inexpensive transportation you can catch the bus that goes up and down the strip, as it is always handy and you can get a three-day unlimited pass for only $20. If it\u2019s a hot summer month and you don\u2019t want to feel like a sardine in a sauna, I do not recommend the bus \u2013 I promise a cab or rental car is better for trips that are not within walking distance. The restaurants are great and reasonably priced for Las Vegas standards. I recommend Brand for a spectacular steak dinner. Ask for Alex, she\u2019s the best waitress. Remember all items are al-a-carte. Diablo's has really good Mexican food and during the summer a great patio. Although the pool was not open during this trip, it is a fun place with the lazy river.

This is a great place to stay with a group of friends or if you are traveling for business. It is much smaller than other casino hotels on The Strip (or maybe it just feels that way?) but still provides wonderful amenities and easy access to anywhere you want to go. Check in was smooth and easy both times, and had a much shorter wait than other resorts I have stayed at in Las Vegas before. The Concierge on duty when we checked in helped us decide on another show to see when we arrived, I appreciated her honest opinions and upbeat attitude - especially since my group was being a little difficult and all trying to buy our tickets separately but have seats together. The Lobby is clean and smells awesome. Casino seems smokier than at some other properties, and it is very small. However it is never too crowded and it was a great place to wind down at night/early hours of the morning. They also have several sit-down restaurant options, and although we did not take advantage of them we did think there was a great variety with fairly priced items. Since we were all young girls on a budget, we appreciated the food court in the hotel which had Subway, Sbarro, Starbucks, etc. for those times we did not want to spend the extra money to sit down somewhere a little nicer. The rooms are a bit outdated but were kept very clean, and we had just enough room for the four girls we squeezed in there :) Location is great as well. We walked over to New York New York and Excalibur for restaurants, bars, and casinos. You can hop on the monorail to get from Monte Carlo to City Center and even Bellagio, which then puts you right in the middle of The Strip. It really is a great location! I have also stayed at Treasure Island, Wynn, and The Four Seasons in Las Vegas. I would recommend Monte Carlo for trips when you won't be spending too much time in your room or looking for fine dining or shopping options at your hotel.

Bills Gambling Hall opposite bellagio seemed to be the cheapest with Margharitas at 2dollars small but ok.Whilst there dont miss Big Elvis a free show at 3oclock and 7 oclock most days arrive about 40 mins early to get a seat. Back to Monte Carlo the buffet is pretty good we had breakfast twice at $14.99.Its pleasant as it is away from the hustle and bustle which is difficult to escape in LV.If your on a budget go to the food hall for Macdonalds ,Subway and other outlets an Egg McMuffin meal about 8dollars. I dont gamble but had a great time in Vegas there is so much to see and do and so many restaurants you cant go wrong for eating although watch out for the air conditioning .I was miserable in the Hard Rock cafe opposite even though we swapped tables I was freezing and it spoiled the occassion.Th eplace was abit of a let down too I was expecting it to be top knotch on the LV strip but it wasnt as good as the one in Naarma bay Sharm el Sheikh.

We had to squat while in the shower to fit under the shower fixture. The shower leaked the entire time - and not just a few drops. We never called it in and I don't think the maids cared all that much since they never addressed the issue either. the hotel does have a smell to it but only in the casino area - and all the hotels have it. It's gross the smell of smoke in the casinos and it seeps into your clothing. The room was clean, the bed was comfy and they had black out curtains. We were barely in the room so it was fine. I spent an afternoon at the spa. Exactly what every girl needs after 5 days in Vegas. I had a great mesage with Andrew and enjoyed the hot tubs and steam rooms afterwards. We ate breakfast twice at the hotel - I forget the name. It was good. We never made it to the food court (don't eat fast food) or the buffet. If I ever go back to Vegas I would probably stay at another hotel just to try something different but there was nothing wrong with this one. Yes it does need to be updated but it's not the end of the world. The hotel has a great location on the strip with monorail access.

The lines weren't too bad at the time, however, I don't know why it takes each person so long to get checked in. If you see a long line there, it's going to be a while. They need to find a way to speed it up. I thought the room was good. I didn't think it was dated. Had all the amenities except they hide the hair dryer in the closet in a bag which I didn't know about until I called the front desk. There is also no fridge in the room to store water but that wasn't a big deal. I had a room with a nice view of the valley facing West. I advise upgrading to a higher floor up in the tower if you want a great view. Elevators were fast and it's easy to get in and out of the Hotel. Lots to see there other than the Casino. We ate at the Steakhouse one night which was great and had drinks at one of the bars. The \"Minus 5 Icebar\" is also in the Hotel but we never made it in there. There's a fee to get in and it sounded too touristy and lame so we passed on that. Part of the deal included two complimentary meals at the Hotel Buffet. I found out later that I had to mention that to the buffet cashier and this was after standing in a long buffet line. They didn't really explain how to get compensated for the meals at check in. Turns out, you have to charge it to your room, then it gets comped when you check out. Kind of a strange way to do it and confusing. I charged it to my card so I got screwed on that one. The food at the buffet was good but nothing too great. Outside the Icebar is another bar at the end of the Casino with a hot woman dancing on a stage. It was strange as there's not much around her other than gambling tables. Still a nice thing to see when walking by. ;) The Hotel is in a great location, maybe a third of the way up the strip. We walked up to Caesars Palace a few times but having to go up and down all the stairways that go over the streets made it a bit tiring. I recommend cabbing it to the other Hotels. There's also a tram in the back of the Monte Carlo that goes up to the Bellagio so that's another option. Some commented on noise in the Hotel.

We only paid $46 for our room. The view was just spectacular! The casino was our favorite part... we found the Deal or No Deal game and large Wheel of Fortune to be our favorites... we actually won $650!

This is where the hair dryer is kept. The room itself was clean, as was the bathroom, and the toilet had a jet engine like flush. Awesome. The fixtures look like they are just out of the 1970s. I did not care for the shower at all. It looked cool, a square showerhead with four squares shooting out water. But it was quite cold in Vegas, and would have preferred a better more all covering shower, and an ability to change settings. There is a safe in the room, it is wall-mounted by the door, it holds a lot more than it looks like it would. It was able to hold 2 laptops, a camera, a travel wallet, iPad, and two iPods, with a couple of manipulations to get the door to close. We had room service once, and ordered a movie. Room service was right on time, and it was pretty tasty. The movie ordering process was very easy, but I was not able to order a movie the second time, it kept saying not available. This was actually a few hours before midnight on NYE 2011, so I guess too many people were ordering movies then. I had gotten sick from a night out of boozing, and woke up pretty sick.

The bathoom ceiling is so low that for those of you that are very tall, you might have to bend down a bit, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to do that.

We've stayed at several other properties on the Strip in the past, but the Monte Carlo was by far the worse. The room, and hotel in general was outdated and in dire need of renovation. The only positive was the comfortable bed. The room was not very clean, and housekeeping was TERRIBLE! The pillows were hard, and the bedding was worn. Two days in a row I called for a manager, but they are very well insulated so it is nearly impossible to air a complaint. The sheets had holes in them and grease stains, before I raised a big enough stink to get them changed. They never gave us clean glasses, and the only thing they did was make the bed. The floor was never vacuumed, and the bathroom was not cleaned. The furniture is well worn, and needs to be replaced. I asked for a housekeeping supervisor to come to our room, and after making two calls, the supervisor never showed. The next night I called several times and asked for a manager but got the run around over and over until finally one of the managers called me back. She did comp our breakfast the last day, and they took off the resort fee. That's another complaint. The $15.00 plus tax they charge in addition every day for a so called \"resort fee\" is the biggest rip off I've ever seen. It supposedly covers in room internet, but there is no wifi in the rooms. The 40\" flat screen TV they advertise is a joke as well. There are no movie channels such as HBO, and no HD so the picture you get is terrible. You would think for the $15.00 fee, you would at least get decent TV to watch. This is at best, a budget hotel. We had a room with a strip view, but the windows were so dirty, it wasn't much of a view. I'm used to staying at nice hotels, but the Monte Carlo doesn't fit that category In addition, the casino at the Monte Carlo is pretty bad as well. Fortunately, their sister property, the Aria had a nice clean, casino with decent slots.

Check-in was pretty quick, and the front desk agent (maybe Linda?) was nice and helpful.

So we chose the king, which is what we booked, but I was slightly disappointed that we were on such a low floor, and in a handicapped room. The room itself was nice. Large bathroom, comfy bed, etc. Everything was clean. No washcloths the first night, but they were there the 2nd and 3rd night? A minor complaint would be that there weren't enough shower curtain rings on the shower curtain. This created gaps in the curtain and made it somewhat drafty while showering. We didn't complain but noticed it was fixed the final night, so we appreciated that. The tub seemed to have some difficulty draining properly. The location was great - very convenient to everything, including the Duece bus line.There is a free tram that can take you to Aria and Bellagio, which we used a few times. It was very handy having the food court right at the bottom of the elevators! The casino was nice - we stopped and gambled a few times throughout the trip. The hotel is beautiful inside and outside. Very nice smell when you walk in. I think all of the hotels are doing this to try to cover up the smell of cigarette smoke, which I personally like. I'd rather smell something slightly overpowering but good than the stench of rank cigarette smoke. Wish all of the casinos would turn non-smoking. We didn't run into many staff, but the front desk agents and bell staff were nice and helpful. We wanted to try the Minus 5 bar because we saw it on TV one time, but at $15/person just for the bare essentials of getting in, we decided to pass.

She explained that the rate was the same or very similar to the \"conference rate\" that the University negotiated for conference attendees. Well, I reluctantly booked it, which I typically do not do unless I search the Internet for deals first. It was only five days before my flight out, so thought better safe than sorry. The next day I had some time on my hands, so I checked out the Monte Carlo website. I noticed that there was deal on the web site where if you book for two nights, you get two free passes to a buffet. I was surprised that the girl I spoke to didn't mention the deal, especially since she also knew how disappointed I was not to get into the MGM Grand. Nevertheless, I thought I would nicely ask for the free buffet passes when I got there. Very long story short, they refused and no matter how many people I spoke with, they explained that it was not possible. Couldn't do it. Sorry. Seriously? This place wasn't cheap either - and they charged a resort fee of around $18 a night on top of their room fee. The lobby is nice, but the rooms are very average, so I was shocked that people rated it a 4 on hotels.com. Also, the walls are paper thin. I could hear full conversations of the people in the next room for two straight nights - sometimes until 3 am in the morning, which is just not good when you are expected to give a presentation in the morning. To top it off, I called their customer service line at 10 am in the morning and it literally rang for 15 minutes straight (I had it on speaker) and no one ever picked up. Unbelieveable.

They were also suppose to be able to check you in and print you a boarding pass, when I asked for them to do that, they were able to check us in, but they said our boarding passes would not print. So we had to get our boarding passes printed at the airport. The room was old and tired. The bathroom was clean but definitely outdated. The last morning we were there I woke up and went to take my shower, it was then I realized the hotel staff had not left new shampoo, conditioner or bath soap. Luckily we had enough left over from the day before we made it through. Again, there was not ONE big issue, just alot of little issues, that although did not effect our overall great experience in Vegas for the first time, it did make us both realize we will never stay at the Monte Carlo again.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Value\u201d", "Author": "kolonialone", "ReviewID": "UR121768683", "Content": "I booked my stay through and online bidding process for a very reasonable rate considering the National Rodeo Finals were in town while I was there.

When we booked this hotel through our travel agent, we were not told this was going to be the situation. We had dinner at the Dragon Noodle & Co restaurant and enjoyed it immensely. Breakfast at The Cafe was also very good. The tram connecting the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio is very handy - we used it constantly. If only there were fridges provided in these hotels - and tea/coffee making facilities - my rating of the hotel would improve greatly. However, from previous experience in other hotels in Las Vegas, this is nothing but the norm. Overall, for the price we paid I'd rate the hotel fairly highly but if my budget was improved I'd go for the Bellagio next door.

We chose this property for location, price, free shuttle to the National Finals Rodeo, and close access to the bus for Downtown and Fremont Street. We found the check-in to be a little time consuming, but very friendly and professional service. VERY nice front desk clerk who even asked if we would like to have a room on the same floor as one of our other friends who were checking in at the same time. Our room was on the 25th floor , and even without a \"strip view\" we had an amazing view of the newer \"city center\" next door. The rooms were clean and everything was in nice condition and working order. The beds are AWESOME ! The casino is large enough to keep you entertained, but not so large that you cant find your way, or loose your companions or your way to the elevators. I loved the fact that there was a Starbucks and McDonalds right there near the elevator lobby for any FAST needs for coffee or snacks. The only better thing would be if there were a coffee maker in the room. We do notice that most Las Vegas hotels do not offer that, not sure why? We had a very busy schedule and so many places to go, and we loved the close access to the bus, the monorail, and even hired a limo for our group from right there in the taxi / limo lane of the hotel. Some of our party were able to spend time at Diablo's and enjoy drink specials and free shots ! There is a CVS store right next door where you can get bottles of water, soda, liquor and beer if you choose, or snacks and any other necessities. Since our stay was in the colder season we did not get to use any of the pool facility, but it looked like a great place to relax and enjoy during warmer weather. There looked to be some pool renovation going on while we were there. The only part of our stay that we would be dissatisfied with would be the 16.00/day \"resort fee\", which since it was not pool season, we never really got anything for that fee, that we could identify. Unfortunately , nearly ALL the resorts in LV are charging these \"resort fees\", for exactly what, I don't know. Over all a great place to stay.

This was the nicest room we have stayed in for Vegas.Large, very clean, super quiet and great view of the strip. We stayed on the 9th floor and were quite please with our location. The hotel is a little upscale and very nice. We never had a meal there or cocktails. We tended to do our breakfasts across the strip and a little south at the Salsa Cantina. A great mexican cafe with $2.00 Bloody Marys' and a$ 5.00 breakfast. We actually both ate and had drinks for cheaper than 1 breakfast at the MC...so we continued to head to the cantina several times throughout our trip. We did go to the Pub on Friday night and were very disappointed that at 12:30 the band stopped and they basically \"kicked\" us out! (really, in Vegas??) They did have a tap beer \"special\" plus a shot of Jack Daniels for $5.00 or a plastic boot filled with beer for $10.00. My first boot had a leak and made a huge mess all over the table. We had little or no wait service, so I ended up taking it back for a replacement myself! It was great that they had a shuttle to and from the Thomas and Mack arena for the rodeo, but other than that and a few hay bales put in strategic places,,,you would never know this was much of a host hotel. Other things offered was the additional resort fee...from which we got nothin...never saw a paper once in our room or elsewhere in the hotel,too cold to swim, we didn't bring laptops for the wireless interenet...so that was pretty much a wash.We were very disappointed in the \"M\" player's card. Also, we got nuthin! Usually there is a two for one meal, cocktail discounts ect. We actually had a hard time even finding out about the card, getting one and getting it to work. it was a super hassle and not at all as good as the other places we have stayed. (Hooters, Harrah's, Stardust and the Excalibur) We didn't do too much at the hotel itself, but did try and spend some money in Diablos' in the tex/mex restaraunt bar and grill attached to the MC. For the third time in a row, we were pissed by the time we left this place.My friends had coupons for discount drinks, but the bartender wouldn't honor them. We tried to buy a t-shirt from the bar, but the bartender couldn't work the till (he was messed up!) and then when I asked the host if we could please purchase a shirt he only replied \"only the bartenders can sell them!\" I give up. On a good note, the music was good and the shot girls were adorable and worked super hard...I just felt bad that they got stuck in this bar and not on the strip elsewhere. Needless to say, we'll never hit Diablo's again. Pretty much every body but the shot girls were rude in there. Hotel staff for housekeeping were great and very efficient. Casino workers and cocktail waitresses were great too. We would definately stay at this place again, I am just sad they don't embrace more of the rodeo spirit for the 10 days. We hopped over to the MGM and that place was rocking...they had a huge live viewing party, gave away prizes, good drink specials, and featured a \"Gold Buckle Zone\" with two live bands, giveaways and Trevor Brazile's Saddle and Buckle Display.

The only complaints I had was that the towels smelt of burnt caramel (!) and I had to get them changed and the queue was long to check in - they need to sort out the check in line so that there are not lots of queues for each agent.

(4) Diablo's bar is fun and the food is OK - this is a place for twentysomethings who want to get smashed and listen to loud music - the death wings here are REALLY hot - actually will hurt your hands as well as your tongue, but good drinks and a fun upbeat staff.

Great location - connected to City Center and Bellagio with monorail. Not the best equiped hotel but with the new City Center a short walk through the hotel its has it all very close by. We used the monorail quite a few times and it was very easy and ultimately very helpful as we sepent a fair bit of our time in the Bellagio, Cosmo and Aria. I expected the room and casino to be tired and a bit grotty and was soooo wrong. Yes the rooms need a bit of a touch up but they where extremly clean and above all comfortable. The bed was the best of any hotel I had stayed in and the spa tub in the room over looking the strip was a big bonus. Checkin/out where super quick - one major gripe was the $200 deposit we had to pay which I knew nothing about on top of the $15/night resort fee (which I was aware of). The $200 is actually taken from your account and then refunded - which in a sense is sad as we get charged for using our credit card and also get hit by the bank as its a UK card! But the above was a very minor quibble and loved this hotel. Its not themed, or overly plus or high end but very comfortable - thats the best word I can use to describe it. The Casino was good for us first timers, who in all honestly where a little nervous about the gambling and the etiquate that applies. We needant of worried though as the staff were very helpful and friendly and explained all the rules with patient and vigour. The waitress service was also one of the best/quickest we recived - second to the MGM Grand. We only ate at the Pub (seperate review) which was great food and again excellent service. The food court was convienient but avoid the McDonalds as they simply dont have a clue! We never ate in the other restaurants as we didnt like the way they all looked onto the casino which is a little smokey.............I smoke myself but to be honest dont like smoke around my food as I have never smoked in my house and thought the smoking ban was a great idea. We did visit the Brand nighclub in the wee hours which was a blast - only small and about $20 each to get in but girls drink free and the cost for my drinks were not excessive. They were renovating the pool area when we were there (mid Nov) and you could see areas that were to recieve a make over. I can honestly say that this was a good place to stay at and would stay again - if on a budget. The above mentioned link the City Center really done it for us as it was convient. Room service also was decent - again not too pricey for food (drinks a different matter!) and tasty - had the Phili Cheesesteak, was yummy. Great location to visit strip as you have Bellagio, Venetian (our fav), Ceasars TI to the north and NYNY, Luxor and Mandalay Bay to the south. Top tip - if you get a suite with a bar, as we did, there is a CVS, Walgreens and a Liquor store facing/next to hotel. Go there and stock up on ale/wine as its a lot cheaper. There is a fridge in the room, ice machine on the floor by the elevators and also a water/soda dispensor by ice machine. The CVS is to the left as you leave the front of the hotel, the Walgreens and Liour store are on the other side of the road facing the hotel.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWow strip view room\u201d", "Author": "krisy82", "ReviewID": "UR120901818", "Content": "Got this hotel way cheap.

I've stayed at worse hotels in Las Vegas, and I was happy at this one. Not excellent, might stay again, might not - it did the trick. It's also a little smaller than some of the other hotels, which does has some advantages. Hotel rooms are a little dated but this is what you get for an average \"weekend\" rate in Las Vegas. The wait to check in frustrated me. There's no formal queue, you just line up behind whatever party is at the counter (after someone came and told us this) and wait....and wait some more...and wait some more. We arrived, it wasn't busy, and were 2nd at the counter, and waited for around 20 minutes. No wifi in the rooms but that's not completely uncommon. Room was spacious, flat screen tv. no fridge or mini bar, I read on another review you can pay for a fridge, but we didn't know that. Bathroom was good, no fan/ventilation though, but the shower was excellent! Great pressure to help you get over the previous night. Bathroom tap was annoying, turn it on and it's full force and water goes everywhere so be carefuly with this! Rooms were clean overall and we were on a non smoking floor. Elevators quick as well. Breakfast buffet was okay, $20 per person, no toast to be found, but an egg making station, and no lines in the morning (some more popular hotels you can wait a bit for a table). We ate lunch at the cafe next to the buffet which was good. They also have Starbucks and McDonalds, a Cupcake place and some others. Casino, a little stale smelling in the mornings from the smoke, but we enjoyed ourselves in there at night. The waitresses with the drinks were a bit inconsistent. One time we waited around 40 minutes before we saw anyone. Location is okay, better than average but there are more centrally located hotels. Keep in mind, just because the hotel \"next door\" looks close it can still be a 10-15 minute walk. I think they had a tram and monorail to other hotels, but we didn't actually see them or use them. You can walk through to Aria (and go and watch Cirque Elvis) and Bellgio is next door. CVS and Walgreens on the corners also.

Alot of the buffet workers, and even the Players Club workers would be snippy, and give you the look of death when you asked a simple question.

We spent majority of our time at aria and bellagio and just slept at monte carlo. When we arrived at the hotel and went to check in the agents were none informative didnt even tell us how to get to the room we had to stand in line and ask concierge since the line was shorter. We stopped by the concierge desk later that day to ask for dinner suggestions and the guy we spoke to (cant remember his name) seemed irritated that we didnt know where we wanted to dine. He made us feel incompitant we just asked for a magazine and decided to figure it out ourself. After that experience we didnt want to go back so we called mirage to buy show tickets. We were not sure where mirage was so I decided to ask concierges on the way out of the hotel since the guy was now gone. The gal we spoke with (sameena) was very nice and pulled out a map for how to get to mirage and asked us what we planned on going to do there I told her to pick up tickets she said she could print them out for me all she needed was my ID she gave us the tickets and even offered resturant suggestions (without us asking and without making us feel stupid!!!) she was just wonderful and full of information. We had dinner at brand the food was pretty good but the service was terribly slow, we had reservations for 530 and got seated right away but it took a long time for a server to come and take our order. We both ordered steak and didnt think it would take that long for it to get made. We waited and waited and waited the server kept disapearing for long periods of time when he finally came back we had to stop him and ask him where the food was and he rushed past and said he will check. 5 minutes later the food arrived it was a little cold but tasted great. We asked for the check right away assuming that would take a long time that came quickly and that was the only time our server took the time to ask us how everything was and hoped we had a great dinner (of course because he wanted a good tip) typical! We had the same exact experience the next day at the their mexican cantina the service was slow the servers were rude and the food was bland. The only good thing was the margaritas. I think this hotel should focus on service at their restaurants we noticed they were always empty and the food court was always full.

But after evaluating the grammar, double negatives, and spelling, I considered the source and ignored them. Evaluating a hotel in my opinion is based on quite a few factors including and most important THE PRICE YOU PAY TO STAY! If you pay a bundle, you should expect a lot. If you pay a little, you should NOT be upset if it is not The Four Seasons. After a few days at the Monte Carlo, only two items aggravated me. The first being there is no WiFi in the lobby. Yes, you read correctly. Not sure why, but that certainly needs to change seeing we are living in 2011. The second item is they have no feeder line at check in. What's with that? So, your gambling starts early when you check in by picking out WHICH line you wait in. You can take a very good educated guess by sizing up the clientele standing in these lines. If they have more than three pieces of luggage or lack a full set of teeth, definitely move on to a different line. I found the rooms to be just fine. Clean but slightly dated. The maid service was good and they always were willing to bring towels up to the room very quickly. The casino was also adequate. It had a food court inside with McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and so on. There was never a wait to cash in your winnings at the cashier cage. There were reviews that complained about the pool. The pool was acceptable, although not a tropical oasis. It was clean, not crowded, and they brought you anything you desired while basking in the sun. I found the drinks to be above average. I read reviews of the Monte Carlo not being in a \"happening\" place or in the center of all the action. Trust me, no matter WHERE you stay, and that includes The Bellagio, Venetian, and Caesars Palace, you are going to have to WALK to get ANYWHERE! And you will walk miles, so if you are not in shape, overweight, or don't like to walk you may want to rethink your travel plans. The streets are PACKED with people. There are a lot of shops and places to go that are within a stone's throw of the Monte Carlo including an AMAZING luxury shopping experience called Crystals at City Center. You have to see it to believe it. Something that caught my attention was a Minus 5 Lounge located inside the Monte Carlo. Everything inside is ice. The bar, tables, glasses, and chairs. And yes, it is COLD in there. Amazingly, the place was packed. Obviously, these people were not from the North. Bid on this hotel through Priceline and try to get a rate of about $75.00 a night.

The Hotel Lobby is very nice and is what you would expect from a four star hotel with Marble Floors and a very nice check-in and concierge. The common areas were clean and well maintained. When we checked in we were given a room that was a little worse for wear with older furnishings and a comforter that was ripped. We went to the front desk to request a different room and they accomodated our request with a slightly nicer room on a higher floor. The second room was clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable and there was a flat screen television in the room. The wall safe worked well and the view was nice overlooking the pool and the ARIA hotel next door. The only thing I would suggest they do is consider adding a coffee pot to the room, but other than that I was very pleased. The pool area of the resort was also very nice with a wave pool, lazy river, and a swimming pool. The pool side service was friendly and they had a nice selection of drinks and food. The casino was clean and not as crowded as some of the others on the strip. The location was very convenient with a free Tram running from the Monte Carlo to the the Bellagio, which came in quite handy. Generally speaking the staff was quite friendly and helpful. My one complaint would have to be the $15.00 resort fee that they say covers your use of the pool and the internet. The internet service is not even wireless so it is pretty much a total joke and I was actually insulted to have to pay a $15 fee for an internet connection that wouldn't work with any sort of modern wireless devices.. I think instead of a resort fee they should just fire some people in their marketing department to reduce expenses and get rid of the fee. The marketing department must have come to the conclusion that since they couldn't sell rooms at a higher rate it would be easier to just take advantage of unsuspecting tourists by charging them a hidden $15 per day fee instead of going out at trying to sell rooms at a higher rate. Realistically this is a pretty nice hotel that is centrally located.

It\u2019s in a great location near the center of the strip and the rooms were fine. Clean and plenty of room but the beds were horrible. Neither of us could get comfortable (not usually an issue while partying in Vegas but since this was a work function, uncomfortable beds were a real issue). The restaurants were not worth checking out although we did ask one of the doormen for a recommendation for sushi and steak. He clearly stated that we should eat at other casinos this week. His recommendations were fantastic so thank you for your honesty. On a positive note, The Pub at MC was a cool place for a beer although they were out of too many beers and closed at midnight. I don\u2019t gamble but my wife plays poker. She only played for a few hours at the Monte Carlo because the action was very slow. She grabbed a seat in a tournament at Caesar\u2019s that was much better than anything being offered at MC. I saved the best (worst) for last. The show at Monte Carlo was pretty bad. I was surprised that the Jabbawockeez were able to get $90 a ticket for this act. This show is cheaper than others on the strip but is still not worth seeing at any price. Simply not worth the time spent. The show was a disjointed mess of bad skits with decent music. I kept waiting for them to pull it together and pull off something that we would talk about later over dinner but nothing ever happened.

I had to wash all my clothes that I didn't wear to get the smell out. I ate at Diablo's one day...I had the steak tacos that were great! I also had a margartia that was just ok... Personally I don't like any margaritas that come out of a machine. I also at at the Cafe once for an early dinner, and once for breakfast. The bacon cheeseburger was delicious...as were the pancakes... The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The pillows were stiff and almost too fluffy. I should have called for feather pillows, but did not. If you do stay here make it worth your while and call for a feather pillow. It is blatantly obvious that this hotel is trying to cater to college kids (or the like). The BRAND steakhouse doubles as a nightclub in the evening. The music PUMPS, PUMPS, and PUMPS some more. I couldn't even talk to the dealer at my blackjack table because the music was so loud. I had a room facing the strip so the music from the pool did not bother me. The casino is a little bit dingy looking, and dark. The poker room is a joke. However, the people running the poker room are very nice and professional. It's just hard to get a game going and stay going. The hotel has easy access to ARIA via walkway or tram. It was only a few minute ride to Bellagio via tram, this is a great feature. If you are an older person please consider staying elsewhere and save yourself the trouble. It is an ok place to visit during the daytime. All I have to say is that you get what you pay for in Vegas. I didn't pay a whole lot for this (work trip) but I do believe I got what my work paid for. Next time I will stay at Mirage or Bellagio...at least if I can help it.

In the bathroom a piece of wallpaper was curling up. This obviously had been there for quite awhile. Perhaps someone could run down to Walgreens and buy some Elmers glue. Also the tinting on the window, a large piece was torn off. This make the room look a little like a Days Inn, instead of a 4 star hotel. The pool area wasn't very big, but I managed to find a chair when I went down there. One of the days I was there it was 109 degrees f outside. The wave pool was positively cold. Very nice. This hotel charges $6 for a bottle of beer. To add insult to injury, MGM Resorts has managed to find another way to nickel and dime you. When you get the beer it is now $6.49, tax is added. This must be the only place in the US where the tax is not included. It's a good thing MGM doesnt own gas stations. Overall I like this hotel, other than the $20/night resort fee which basically amounts to a free newspaper.

You can rent a tube for the day or alternatively buy them beside the pool. They sell the metal bottles of beer to drink in the pool for $6. They have Heineken and Corona and a selection of domestic beers. A lot of young singles playing about in the pool with a pool DJ playing music. Good atmosphere for singles. Almost makes you want to be young again. There is a second nearby pool if you want to get away from that environment. There is no wifi in the rooms here. You need an ethernet cable to use it. You pay a resort fee of $16 per day which they say in their promotional material is for in room internet (no good if you cant use it) and for daily newspaper you have to collect yourself near the lift on your floor, for free local phone calls (which seems standard in most US hotels), free copying and faxing (when I asked about this I was told it for printing of boarding passes by the counter staff and that if it was anything else I would need to use the pay per use PCs located around the lobby). In short I think the resort fee is a scam and just a defacto way of increasing the room rate. Some of the casinos in Vegas are no longer charging this fee. There is a McDonalds, Subway, and Haagen Dasz in the food court located on the ground floor. McDonalds has their free wifi there. The Monte Carlo is located at the better end of the strip where the newer hotels are. MGM grand, Aria, Mandalay Bay, New York, New York are all in this segment of the strip.

Even though the hotel was extremely busy when we arrived we were checked in and in our room within 10mins! The room was a little outdated but there was plenty of room, the bathroom was quite tatty but again there was plenty of space to make up for that and it was clean. The bathroom was also styled with marble which was a nice touch. Our room had a fantastic view overlooking the strip and the top of the casino. Considering the hotel was so busy it was very quiet at night. We never had a chance to use the pool facilities as there is so much more to do in Las Vegas. We used the casino which in my opinion was one of the better ones to play at along the strip. It was also good to have several fast food restaurants within the complex aswel as a pub/nightclub type venue. There is also a bar type thing that serves frozen alcoholic drinks...definitely recommend getting one (or two!) of these!! The hotel is in a good location, it's about a 10min taxi ride from the airport which cost us less than $15. It is also only a short walk to the MGM casino, New York New York casino and Excalibur casino.

We like the location - central strip with easy access to the MGM, Excalibur (from there free tram to Luxor or Mandalay) or the other side with free tram to Bellagio. We got a very good price for the room (Sunday through Wednesday) and even though the resort fee is steep ($16.80/night) - it is declared up front and you just have to fold it into your total cost. Parking is a breeze and nice quick walk to reception. Wish they had a better system for the front desk. You basically pick a desk and then hope it will not take that long. Well.... just like in the supermarket - you always end up picking the wrong line! :-) They should just have one common line and then guide people to the next available counter. No biggie though. First room we got was on the 17th floor and was a handicapped access room. No problem with that, however, when we entered the room you could hear the pounding of the DJ playing the hip-hop music at the pool. It was a little much for our taste, especially since we like to rest in the afternoon and that would be impossible with that music. Called front desk and were switched to a room on the other side of hotel on the 25th floor. Did not even have to go back down, keys were re-coded over the phone. No hassle at all. Our room was very spacious and relatively updated. Furniture showed some wear, but nothing to be upset about. Bed was clean and comfortable. We requested softer pillows (the ones there were really firm and uncomfortable) and this was done no problem. Bathroom was OK, too. Shower was the only downside. Nozzle was very low and sprayed all the water directly in your face at a very strong pressure. Not very relaxing. Had some drainage issues, which were fixed no problem when we called service. Unfortunately, we ended up having some very rude and loud neighbors, but that's not the hotel's fault. These 2 women got \"home\" at 6:00 AM and were exchanging their anecdotes at a noiselevel as though they were at a racetrack or something. They kept screaming and hootin' and hollerin, like it was nobody's business. By 7:00 AM, I finally had enough and went knocking on their door. I asked the woman who answered to please keep it down a little, and I was really nice about it - even called her Ma'am. She looked me up and down and then shouted at me: \"we paid for this room\" and slammed the door in my face. I ended up telling her through the door that we will call Security and that simmered her down to a noiselevel of \"can deal with it as long as you have earplugs\". Again, not the hotel's fault - but a bit of a downer. Just rude! We had room service twice and it was a bit hit and miss, but overall no complaints. Once the fees and taxes and tip for room service is added, it does get a bit pricey though. We ate at the cafe twice and again, no complaints. Friendly wait staff and decent food overall. Dealers at the casino were friendly and drink service was always going around and very friendly, too. Final verdict: we will stay here again. We like the location. The rooms are nice and as updated as possible for an older locale. Elevators are slow and could use some renovating, but that's not a big deal. Staff very friendly.

We generally would stop on every floor and as silly as it seems it was hard to push the button since it's only on one side. We had a Monaco Suite and it was disappointing, the door and walls had a lot of dents and chipped paint. The couch looked like it was from 1970, even though the hotel was built in the 90's. Most of that can be overlooked, however the floor had 2 huge wet spots on it. The master bathroom also had no power at all, nothing worked. We got that fixed, but I wanted a new room because the wet spots didn't dry, well they didn't give us one. The towels had holes and rips in them which is pretty bad for a AAA four diamond hotel. The casino and pool cater to the hip wanna be 20-30's something crowd. I'm 31 but found the music very overpowering at the pool.

Not a very enjoyable gaming experience, so I generally went to the Aria or Bellagio to play.

The beautiful scent of roses hits you everytime you enter the huge marble lobby making this hotel very nice to come back to after a long vegas night. The only downfall of our stay and the reason I booked the Flamingo for this years trip was because after making reservations at the steakhouse, we were left standing for about 1/2 hour while the female maitre d' accepted bribes from people without reservations. Now I know this goes on everywhere, and had she let one or two in ahead of us i would have had no problem. But eleven people without reservations skipped ahead of us while she filled her pockets.

Hotel: The front has a magnificent water fountain and beautiful status but the entrance lacks lights and colors to attract and invite by passers inside the hotel. It feels abandoned. The hideous Mexican/vampire restaurant in the front has covered some part of the architecture and it feels like an added sore thumb to the architecture of the building, I have a feeling this was not part of the original hotel design. They should change that to give it a Monte Carlo feel and look (Monte Carlo is in FRANCE no Mexico, also it should remind people of luxury and elegance not vampires and good times with lots of comfort food. Don't take me wrong I am a big fan of Mexican food just the restaurant doesn't fit in this hotel). Great parking we were able to park within 100ft of the elevator every time for some reason. And they don't make you walk miles inside from parking to elevator, very quick walk from escalator passing check in and elevators. Pools: The best part of the hotel IMO second to location are the 3 pools and spa. A lazy river and a wave pool that goes on once every like 15 minutes or so. I added a video here. Lots of security and life guards and it feels safe for families and kids unlike the stupid video that comes up on YouTube when you lookup Monte Carlo there. Thats why I added the video. There was a drunk middle age lady in the lazy river there who was immediately ejected from the pool area along with her husband, I think she was just having fun but someone complained I guess. Restaurants: We had food at the buffet, the Cafe and the food court. The buffet was ok, not sure if it was worth $19.99 maybe on the weekends when its $25~$26 is better, nothing fancy. The Cafe was really good, we loved eating there breakfast every day. The staff were nice and helpful. Our room key gave us buy one get one free appetizers. The PUB near the pool (cant take their food to the pool chairs) has amazing sliders for $1 from 3-6pm. The only place without happy hour is the pool area restaurant where they bring you food and drinks to your chair so they get you there with $13 drinks and $55~$70 pitchers! No discounts or coupons anywhere. There is free ice at the food court from the machines, which is very helpful. McDonalds and Starbucks right down the elevator? Cant beat that (warning: Starbucks costs almost about twice, Grande Coffee is $3.50 as opposed to $1.95 in LA). Rooms: Well they are dated probably from their original 4.5 status, we have stayed here twice once in 2009 and again in 2011 and its just getting more dated and may fall into 3Star soon if the owners dont start spending some money in the rooms. They still look great and comfortable though but dont give you the sense of luxury or the sense of crisp cleanness you get at like Holiday Inn Express in Henderson. Location: Once you park here you can walk to most parts of the strip (well walking to Venetian and Rio may be a bit far) its right next door to City Center and Luxor on both sides and they both have trams to talk to to a couple more casinos if you dont want to walk too much (well finding the tram is a walk by itself).", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamloops, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHotel Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Rosalind0", "ReviewID": "UR118115018", "Content": "The first time I stayed at the Monte Carlo Hotel in Las Vegas was great.

It was good, but could have been better. Hotel check-in was quick but not friendly. Room was neat, but not clean. There was gum in the carpet that we asked to have removed. Floors needed a good cleaning. We did receive a lot of comps due to our complaints though. We had a refrigerator brought to our room (usual cost $25/day) - comped. Our room deal included two buffet breakfast or lunch, and we were three people - third price was comped. We actually could have had more comped, but we had paid for tickets and other meals with visa, rather than charging it to our room. The location of this hotel is ideal and fairly quiet. We used the fitness centre and although busy, it is a fair size and there are plenty of options for working out. This was probably the best part of this hotel! My Top 10 Tips - 1) if you rent a car, use valet parking, it was free! 2) If you plan to shop at the outlet mall, sign up on their website for a free coupon book. They had plenty of good deals. 3) If you plan to do shows within your hotel's affiliated hotels e.g. Monte Carlo is affiliated with MGM, Aria, Ex Calibur and Mandalay Bay, charge them to your room. 4) If you \"like\" a hotel resort on facebook, prior to going, you may be eligible for some extra deals. 5) Sign up for groupon, or dealfinder, to see if they have discounted excursions in the Las Vegas area. 6) At the Monte Carlo pool, there is a lazy river. To rent an inner tube for the day, it was $9.00. To buy an intertube that says Monte Carlo, it was $11 or $12 dollars. However, you can also bring your own. 7) If you have a car, and want to visit old vegas, you can park in the parking tower and get your parking comped, if you eat at one of the older casinos. We ate at Fitgerald's. Food was great. 8) If you want to see the G&S Pawn Shop from the Pawn Stars TV show, get there early, i.e. 10am or earlier. 9) There is a Disney store outlet at the Premium Outlet Mall North, or a Disney Characters outlet at Premium Outlet Mall South. The North store had the better deals. 10) Drink plenty of water. We bought a case of water at the drugstore, and refilled our bottles as needed. There are plenty of vendors selling water for $1.00 a bottle on the strip. Check the convenience stores though, you can often get a bottle for $0.69. Loved Vegas.

They have a ton of promoters trying to get people into the lounge, and they say you pay $20 for a cup, then you can refill it as much as you like. The problem is, there are only 5 drinks to choose from, and they are not very good. The pool was ok. We almost could not find a chair, but when we did, the waitress was prompt to come take our order. Water was cold, but it was so hot outside it was refreshing. They did not allow any outside drinks/food to be brought into the pool area, and the drinks were expensive. Man, the more I write this, the more I find myself complaining! eeek! Anyway, for the money we spent ( a package deal for flight and hotel for 4 days for $350) it was about what you would expect. But there is nothing special about the Monte Carlo and I will, for sure, not stay here again.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "dusty008", "ReviewID": "UR117981091", "Content": "Spent March break in Vegas for the second time, with spouse and friends - even though we are all way past college age.

They have added new Samsung flat screens and new bedding and pillows to the rooms.

I loved our view of New York, New York and it was really quiet on our floor (for the few hours we actually spent sleeping.) The Monte Carlo is home to Minus 5 Ice Bar, the Jabbowakeez show and Brand Ultra Lounge, and it has several places to eat, including a food court for those late night hunger rages. We accepted the $20 offer to go to the Brand one night with free unlimited drinks upon entry, but if we had known how tiny the club was and how awful their drinks were, we wouldn't have gone there. The music was great, but there was no room to move. The casino is large, but lifeless. Yes, there are plenty of people there gambling, but it is dark and dull. No bling, no dancers, nobody seemed to be having fun in there. It was like a cave for gambling addicts who aren't there for fun. Just my opinion. We ended up taking a limo downtown and hitting up the casinos on Fremont Street and they were WAY more fun. Plus they had cheaper tables for us lightweights. The rooms were nothing to write home about. We had adjoining rooms on the 17th floor and the view was nice, but the rooms left much to be desired. We had certain \"stains\" on our bedding, which was gross and there was a hair on the bathtub. The other room had a bathroom that smelled repulsive the entire trip. The beds were comfortable though, not that that would matter much after an exhausting night on the town. The pool area is nice, but crowded. I liked that it had a regular pool, a wave pool, and a lazy river. You had to pay for the tube rentals though, which was kind of lame. One thing that the resorts I've stayed at in Mexico and Jamaica can learn from this place though, is how to fit enough lounge chairs to accommodate the guests! Kudos to the Monte Carlo for having ample chairs. The music was loud, but it was good! And this is Vegas! The shops were just okay, but there are plenty of other hotels nearby with great shops, so that didn't matter. You're right between New York and the Bellagio and a short walk from Paris, too. There are plenty of great places to go that are super close. Oh, we LOVED Fat Burger, which is directly across the street. Great burgers on the cheap!!! Just a little bonus for you! After we all partied on Fremont Street one night, we decided we liked \"Old Vegas\" better than the strip for nightlife. They had some great free performances and everything seemed more affordable there.

We visited a lot of hotels and the Monte Carlo was the only hotel that had this very distinct unpleasant perfume smell. If you are sensitive to smells this may really bother you. It's not really noticeable in the rooms, but it is like a punch in the face as soon as you get into the lobby and it is in the casino as well. I'm not sure what odor they are trying to cover up with this perfume that is constantly wafting in the air, but they need to figure something else out. You can't get away from it unless you leave the hotel. They can also do without the \"resort fee\". There are many hotels waiving the resort fee. You really don't get anything from paying for it.

I also enjoyed that you got comped drinks at the bar slots, Wynn does not offer this. The only issue we had was on our first night.

First lets start with the good. The hotel lobby and downstairs area including the casino are clean , bright, etc with a good selection of machines for the most part including new machines like American Idol, Wheel of Fortune, Sex and the City etc. The employees are very helpful and courteous. They have a tram that goes to Bellagio and the Aria so I was able to visit other casinos while I was there. My check in took about 10 min which is not bad but there is no organization in the lobby area so sometimes when I walked past there were a lot of people checking in and it seemed very disorganized but as I said I arrived later at night so had no problem. The pool area was very nice and includes a wave pool and lazy river. . Unfortunately they had a fire at this hotel a couple of years ago and completely renovated the top floor into very nice rooms. I wish they had spent the money redoing the entire hotel. My room was clean and was kept clean by the staff who were very courteous as I have mentioned however for a suite it was very disappointing. I have stayed at the Signature at MGM, The Palazzo, The Venetian, Encore and The Wynn which all have suites the same size. My furniture was banged up, there was no safe for valuables , and the carpet was old as was the rest of the furniture in the room. Do not get me wrong the room as I said was clean but for a suite I expected more of a wow factor. The rooms need an update asap. The only problem I had at the pool was that I was there for an hour and not one time did anyone stop by to ask about drinks etc. I had to go and get my own which I have noticed is becoming a problem with all the hotels I have stayed at on the strip lately as far as the pool area goes. Also a word about resort fees. If someone quotes you a price on the phone get a name. I have a slot card and turned down three comped nights at the MGM in a regular room because the price I was quoted for a suite at the Monte Carlo was so good and was told it included the resort fee which it did not. Once I got home I called the hotel and was not going to get into a massive argument over a 30.00 difference however there was no way to prove someone in casino services gave me that quote or not so I was stuck with the bill. So in closing the Monte Carlo is a nice place to gamble, the pool area other than the service was great however the rooms need an upgrade so make your determination on how attached you are to having a nice room as opposed to an ok one for whatever price you are given. I myself would prefer a regular room at the MGM next time since it has been redone as opposed to the suite I had at the Monte Carlo.

Compared to the newer hotels (Aria & Vdara) and hotels that are being refurbished (Bellagio & MGM Grand) the Monte Carlo appears a bit old, tired and bland. Obviously they refurbish the hotels where they get a better return on investment & can charge higher room rates like the gorgeous Bellagio. So the Monte\u2026.. Long waits for service at check in counters and this was during the week - much worse on the weekend. Lots of counters but not many staff? Bit of a long walk through the casino to get to the hotel elevators but at least the Monte doesn't have the revolting cigarette cloud that hits you as soon as you open the door (just visit Circus, Circus, Luxor or the Excalibur if you want that experience). Location was convenient and easy to get around. The hotel pool was pretty ordinary compared to many others I saw in Vegas - you wouldn\u2019t stay here for the pool scene. Limited opening hours (9am \u2013 7pm) mean there's not much time to have a quick dip and relax by the pool if you are out and about all day. On the weekend it was over crowded and there wasn't even room to swim. Seems you just go to the pool to drink beer and listen to techno not swim. Surely this must annoy a lot of the hotel guests? My room was smoke free, beds clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are tired & old but thankfully clean. No luxurious tubs here.

Lets say the resort has gone downhill since then. Our problems began upon check-in, I had called twice the first time two weeks prior and as requested by the staff two days prior to check-in to inform/request of the front desk staff that six rooms (the seventh had paid for a higher floor room) be assigned next to each other or at the very least very close to each other. This was essential for my 87 year old mother-in-law whom required my assistance. This seemed impossible to accomplish on check-in, at first we were all on different floors then after 1 1/2 hours of waiting and talking to the desk clerk and an area manager we finally got most of the rooms on the same floor, at the time the rooms were not ready although it was well after the stated check in time the clerk told me they would call my cell phone when the room was ready - I'm still waiting for the call. After finally getting my room we received the one thing that I told the clerk was unacceptable, a room with an adjoining door. Although resolved it was one more inconvenience. When I booked the trip I called the resort to ask if there was internet access at the resort as I needed to be in touch with my office on my iPad. The reservationist told me there was. As I found what was provided for the resort fee was an out of date phone modem. I called the front desk to ask if there was a wireless connection, the desk clerk told me no but I could go across the street to McDonalds. Good idea send guest across the street. I did a search on my iPad and found a cox cable wireless connection which worked. I just assumed that the clerk did not know about the service and called the front desk back to tell him about it. I got another clerk and told her, \"her response was how did you get into that, we don't tell guests that we have it\"! What? Also the uninformed clerks don't know that the McDonalds in the resort food court also has free Internet access. As for the resort fee. I do not mind paying my fee as I do use the Internet and resort facility's but is it fair to charge it to an 87 year old woman? When my mother in law asked to speak to a manager about fee the area manager said under no circumstances could the fee be waved. My mother in law began to write a note of complaint about the fee on the bottom of the check-in sheet that she was signing, the manager grabbed it out of her hand and said you can not write a note on that! My husband said what is wrong with that, will you get in trouble? He got no response. It was very upsetting and disrespectful. My mother in laws door was not closing properly during the entire visit, the staff was aware of the problem when they needed to get the door open the night before. We also asked it to be look at earlier that day because we had to pull it closed. On Thursday however we could not open the door due to the fact that the door was coming off of the hinges, when we called the front desk and they stated that they don't deal with that and transferred him to the maintenance number where no one answered the phone. Although resolved by the night manager we had to call him ourselves. We also called twice to get the clock in my mother in laws suite fixed or replaced. Three days and two clocks later it was finally replaced. The night manager was the only employee we encountered that was helpful and not rude.

Last year, I stayed at Bally's and the internet was around $15 per day as an add on, and the exercise room was in the $25 dollar range as I recall. So for this kind of money we got a hotel with a fantastic pool area, easy access via the tram to Aria and Bellagio. Our room had a view of the pool, which was kind of nice, but the windows were very dirty form the Las Vegas duststorms, which was unfortunate. The music was loud at the pool, but it was about the same as our stay at Bally's last year. But the other reviewer who said get a room away from the pool was correct. The music is loud starting at around noon, but ends at 7 pm., which was no big deal for me. Rooms with views, upper floors, etc., all cost more, so be warned before you do something you'll regret. Our room was \"standard\" which consisted of two queen beds, a table, and a straight back chair. There was a 42\" flat tv sitting on top of a ridiculously small three-drawer dresser. The full cable tv channel selection was available, plus the usual hotel offerings of movies and adult fare. The bathroom had a hair dryer, iron, every lotion and soap imaginable, two drinking glasses and an ice bucket. The cleaning staff took care of us very nicely. There was also a safe that was about 4\" deep for jewelry, but not big enough for a laptop. Mattresses were firm and comfortable, pillow top type. The pool was truly wonderful. There is a \"regular\" pool of good size, and in the shade most of the day; then there is a \"lazy river\", and finally there is a wave pool. There is a small fourth pool for private parties, and there is a hot tub, which we didn't use. They wouldn't let us bring our own drinks into the pool area, which stunk frankly. Drink prices were probably in line with the competition, but were basically a ripoff. $3 for a coffee, $6 for beers, and then $12 to $18 for the fruity booze. They at least provided free ice cold water the entire day. There is plenty of room to walk around and it was crowded, but not so much so that it was impossible to enjoy. We ended going to the pool every morning, or until the music was unbearable. The buffet was inexpensive and mediocre, and we were more content to spend a few dollars more and go to either the Aria or Bellagio buffet. We like good quality meats at the carving station, an assortments of seafood, crab, and sushi, and well-made desserts. Monte Carlo was lacking in quality in all categories. If you like a good buffet, spend $10 more per person, and visit Aria, Bellagio, or Venetian. The check in was rather quick, the concierge was very helpful for the three times we bothered them, and the bell captain was nice enough to hold our luggage for a few hours. No problems there. The best part of Monte Carlo was that you can at least cruise around the public places without being mobbed with gawkers that clog the touristy casinos such as Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, MGM, Mandalay Bay, and Flamingo. There were never any crowds in the bars or on the casino floor. Some of the hotspots were uncomfortably empty even. Obviously the hipsters go somewhere else than Monte Carlo on weekends. Having said that, there always was a pretty good party atmosphere in Diablo's Cantina which is on the street and attached to the hotel. We went there three times for a nightcap before turning in. On a dollar/value scale, it was pretty good.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cwill not come back\u201d", "Author": "gideon m", "ReviewID": "UR117047372", "Content": "I just got back from a stay at the monte carlo ending august 20, 2011.

We bought a mini one at home for the price of one nights rental!!! The location was good for the Bellagio and there's a free tram that takes you to Aria and the Bellagio which was great. It was nice having the food court and the shops but we didn't use them much, especially as there are places over the road to buy things much cheaper. We didn't bother with the pool because it was like a disco whenever we walked past with music blaring and it wasn't exactly a place you could go and chill out with a book. Not sure if they'd be able to cram any more loungers in there either but I'm sure if they could charge for them they would. With regards to housekeeping, our room was always left clean but we found it to be very late in the day. Returning to the room at 3pm and it still wasn't clean? Not ideal. All in all, the hotel was ok. We found the resort fee to be an absolute joke. We basically paid $16 something for a copy of USA Today for 4 days.

The rooms are in pretty good condition, only some slight staining on the carpet and the odd 1-inch rip in the linen. Speaking of linen, we only had facecloths slightly more than half of our week-long stay. The public spaces were nice and clean however the elevators frequently had garbage in them, were under repair, and not air conditioned. Their website says you have to pay for Wi-Fi but its actually free for hotel guests as it is included in the resort fee.

The bathroom sink wouldn't drain, and brushing our teeth and washing our faces was gross and off putting as the sink filled with nasty water. The following morning, housekeeping rattled the door and woke us at 10:00; there was no do-not-disturb sign available to hang outside. However, at 3:00 in the afternoon when we returned to our room from shopping, the maid was in it making the beds. We came home late from a show, carrying only one key card between the two of us and it wouldn't open our door. We faced another 40-minute wait downstairs at the desks to get help. After our demanding a manager over the wait because of what we deemed an emergency--although they did not see it as any kind of a rush problem, it turned out that they wouldn't help us because that card was not connected to the name on the room reservation, and that necessary ID was locked in the room, which the key card wouldn't open. Get the picture? We were furious, and they were absolutely unhelpful. Finally, a member of the security staff met us at our room door after we had been sitting on the hallway floor for twenty minutes, we in evening dresses and high heels, he watching us struggle to our feet with no offer to help us. He opened the door for us, checked the ID, and went away again. The other key card remained unfixed--we were too whipped after our frustrating hour to deal with it any further that night. We were changing our clothes for bed at 11:30 when a knock came at the door--it was the plumber! He was there to fix the bathroom sink while we were half-naked, dead tired, and frazzled from fighting with the hotel staff. The next night, we were awakened at 2:00 by someone trying our door, inserting a key card, and jiggling the door handle. I suppose if our own key wouldn't open it, theirs wouldn't either! We had just gotten back to sleep when a baby down the hall began crying and kept it up for an entire hour! I know this because I kept looking at the clock. On the night before we left, we called the staff to ask about late check out. We were told we could indeed check out late and we needed to call in the morning to confirm. We called in the morning to confirm and were told that we could NOT check out late. I understand that the hotel staff cannot help such things as other guests trying to get into the wrong room and crying babies in the middle of the night, but the most serious of our annoyances during our stay had to do with very unhelpful hotel staff who were clearly uninterested in our welfare. It seemed that once they got our money and had us in their building, they lost interest in making our stay a comfortable one and in some instances, even went out of their way to make us miserable.

We were able to check into our room right away at 1:30pm instead of 3pm. Exiting the elevator on the 9th floor, the carpets already gave indication of neglect. Large stains, in several of the areas right from the elevator and down to the room at 9211. Going inside, the room was again mediocre. Not even a mini fridge, NO COFFEE MAKER!, LADIES BE WARNED IF YOU LOVE YOUR COFFEE WHILE GETTING READY! Even the cheapest hotels have a coffee maker! Come on management! The bathroom again was mediocre...but a clincher was...wanting a shower...get refreshed before heading down stairs to have fun...and explore...the tub filled with about 3-4 inches of water. Standing in this the whole time, while washing it did not drain. It was a full 10 minutes, maybe more for it to drain once the tap was off. So, lets just say the next person in line to freshen up...has to stand in 3 inches of water! Yuck for them! We phone down and expressed our concerns. The on duty manager was polite and apologetic. Oh, we'll send someone up with a mini fridge and get the engineer to repair the tub drainage. Well the fridge came soon enough...10 minutes. I was happy as insulin diabetic need to store all meds in a cold fridge otherwise it becomes ineffective after 24 hours. So put the meds in, have our lovely bath...I mean shower (water pressure was great though) and go out for the evening. We thought the engineer would be back as the manager said he's be there in 20 minutes, while we were out. No one ever came to fix this drainage issue. The fridge was not working. We had to put the meds on plastic in the ice bucket then....next morning we complained and they brought another one...that worked. In short, you can find other excellent hotel rooms for the same price or less or even a few dollars more...ie. Aria would have been 100.00 more as would the Cosmopolitan. I have to say though in their favour the Brand Steakhouse at Monte Carlo was a 10+! We shared a steak dinner...20 ounces and the fixings and the hugest cheescake slice I have ever seen! Plus the service was impeccable. I would go back to this hotel but only for the restaurant and gambling as I won 100.00 :) next time I go in November this year. Hope this helps you all with your decisions...I have never written a review on any other hotel in Vegas because it's always been great...but this one I figured I should warn my fellow travellers.

Thankfully this smell was not in our bedroom, which as I've said already could not be faulted. However, in Vegas you spend your days in hotels so it would be nice to want to linger around your own!! Over the course of our stay we visited most of the hotels on the strip and felt we really had made a bad choice.

We had choices when we booked, and we chose this one partly based on its rating so I felt people should know exactly what they are getting. The exterior of the hotel and the lobby were beautiful but that is where it stops. This was my very first trip to Las Vegas, so I was excited to stay in a \"4 star\" hotel. I have stayed in 4 stars before, so I was really expecting something nice. What we got was a room in which the air conditioner never got the temp below 78 (at best), an awful \"skunk\" odor that would come and go out in the hallway and into our room, the filthiest carpets I have EVER seen (this is no exaggeration...you can not walk 12 inches in this hotel without running into a new stain), and just an overall worn out appearance of everything here. The walls are beaten up and have scuffs and scratches all over them. We stayed on 2 different floors during our visit (21st and 8th) and the experience was the same on both although the air worked a little better on the 21st floor room. We had to move b/c we wanted a king room and they didn't have any for the first night we were there so they offered to move us the next day. The service was good overall. We had to wait a pretty long time to check in as there were only 2 desk clerks working (there is room for 20) and the lines were quite long to get checked in, but the staff was very friendly and polite. But the facility itself is just worn out. It appears that no one in management ever ventures past the lobby/casino area, or they would be horrified at how filthy everything looks. An occasional carpet cleaning would do wonders. And sadly I lost my cell phone while there, or I would have posted some pictures. But I think you get the idea.

They were fixed within a couple of hours but it never really seemed above average.

All in all I have no reservations about going there again if the price is right but they must be doing something very wrong there as the casino was always empty.

We purchased 2 tickets to see the \"Beatles Love\" cirque du soleil show at the Mirage. A fantastic high energy show that is a must see!

This floor is non smoking. we were a bit surprised to find out on entry that our room was a handicapped one. No big deal for us as you got more space. The room was nice and clean, but did have a few scuff marks on the walls. It had a new large flat screen TV and a nice comfortable king size bed. The furniture did look new also. The maid service was very good, left extra towels and plenty of bathroom amenities. We would come back around 12 noon each day to change into our swim wear and head down to the pool. Our room by that time was always cleaned up. The pool area was nice. It had a couple of regular pools, a lazy river and a wave pool. Plenty of chairs available! Towels were issued as you entered. They also had plastic cups, ice water available. (No carry in drinks were allowed, including bottle water). The ice water was great with Nevada's heat & sun. Poolside drinks are expensive for my taste, so we had the water. We liked playing slots at the Monte Carlo, we both actually won a little. Seemed like a lot of people in the casino having a good time. We ate at the Monte Carlo buffet for breakfast ($16.95 per person). It was very good, many food choices. We loved the omelet station. Also ate dinner at the Pub. They have a tasty pub burger with fries ($13.00) that we really enjoyed. They also have a happy hour from 4 to 7 pm I believe. ( 2 for 1 draft beer specials, etc.). Also check out the Cup Cakery down the hall from the pub. Great yummy cupcakes! Check out was a breeze, checked out on Thursday morning around 9:30. We earned a few comps which lowered our bill a bit. (Do make it a point to sign up for a players club card). We enjoyed our stay at the Monte Carlo, everyone was very helpful and friend- ly. Cocktail waitresses were timely as we played the slots. They work hard so we always tip. The only negatives I can think of is dirty carpets in the elevators and floor halls. There is a $15.00 daily resort fee, but you get some services from it like in room wired internet, fitness center access, daily newspaper (USA), airline boarding pass printing, etc. We enjoy going to Vegas about 4 times a year.

They claimed they had unassuming elegance. I would not go that far. My first impression was the fingerprints on the glass doors. Many prints. It seems easy to me to have a staff member regularly take some windex and a paper towel to the glass doors. But once inside I understood why so many prints. The lobby was a madhouse of guests checking in and buzzing around. But my hubby and I were patient was waited in line for our turn. We had booked on another site and got a really good deal--comparable to a Super 8 price. So many others probably got that same deal! The carpets were dingy and didn't look updated. The ads blasting on the TV screen in the elevator was advertizing their in house show--Jabberwakees. The ad itself was loud and obnoxious. But we could tolerate it if only for a minute travel time. We requested a high floor and got 22nd (yes a high enough floor) although our view of the pool was obscured by dusty windows (from the outside). The pool was bumpin' loud music during the day, but thankfully it was off when we finally got in the bed to sleep. The decor was nothing fancy and the bathroom not really luxurious--just an average motel bathroom with nicer toiletries. Looks like the little things were updated to make it seem renovated, but things such as carpeting and wallpaper were older. But yet, for the cheap price, it was comfy and clean enough. We did have some young neighbors wake us up at 4 am coming in for the night/morning obviously intoxicated and loud.

I think what made the difference for me was not that there were no problems, but how well problems were handled. The hotel was beautiful and easy to get to from the airport since the van waiting to take us to our hotel was part of our package deal! Very nice surprise! Our room turned out to be on a smoker's floor, so we called and they changed us out the next day after sincerely trying to minimize the smell in the room. The city was experiencing 100 degree weather, but the hotels, stores, restaurants and public transportation was all beautifully air conditioned so the discomfort was minimized. There were a wide varitety of restaurants right there in the hotel where we enjoyed discounts brought to our attention as soon as we checked in. In fact, every time we asked for help from the front desk, whatever the problem was, it was quickly remedied. They held on to our luggage after checkout so that we could continue to enjoy the city without having to tote that around. They were able to print up our boarding passes early, and our transportation to take us back to the airport was waiting when we returned. In the hotel itself, there were a lot of little shops including some that were great fun just to browse in, and others where we were able to buy bargain tee shirts to bring home for our kids. For little things you may have brought to bring, of course the usual sundries are in the hotel room, but there was another store in the lobby with more, but there are great little stores very close by for anything else you might need. The room itself was wonderful, the bed very comfortable and clean, as was the lovely bathroom. There was a noisy family with young children next door, but that was not the hotel's fault, and the good news was they went to bed really early! The pool area was great fun. From our hotel room, it looked like it would be too hot to be out there, but we found that early in the morning, as soon as they opened, there was a great deal of shade and no crowds! One of the best things about this hotel was that it is extremely close to a lot of other really cool hotels, and they even have free air conditioned trams that take you there! Don't miss the Bellagio. In the other direction, walk across the street to New York and the hotels in that direction are connected also, so you spend the least amount of time in the heat. This is our fourth trip to Las Vegas where we have also stayed at the Paris Hotel, Planet Hollywood and long ago we stayed at Circus Circus when our kids were very small. To me, this hotel holds it own among the best of them, leaving me feeling pampered and rested, at what was a very reasonable price.

Needless to say, we just wanted a hotel on the strip, close to things with a good pool. We did get all those things at Monte Carlo. It has great placement on the strip with a free tram to the new City Center and then Bellagio. It is also next to NYNY and MGM which is fun. The pool is great with one big main pool, a wave pool (whose waves run a little too frequent for my taste) and a lazy river. We shared a $55 pitcher of mojitos which actually went a long way. The only thing I would change about that would be that we weren't allowed to bring in bottled water to the pool area. It's 100 degrees outside and we can't bring in water. Go figure. The casino is smaller than some of the other hotels on the strip so we were done playing there after the first day and a half. We didn't check out their ice bar thing because it was hard to see what the deal was with it. Our main problem with the hotel was that when we checked in, we were informed of the new \"resort fees\" that some hotels in Las Vegas started. For 3 nights, it was an extra $50 per room. They said it was so we could have internet (connected with a cable) and some other stuff. We never used anything that would even come close to covering the amount for the fee. We didn't even turn our tv on until we tried to check out. In fact, when we went to mail a postcard, they charged us $0.50 to mail it because there was a convenience fee on top of what the stamp cost. So let me get this straight, you charge me an extra $50 for the room and then can't cover a $0.20 stamp? Come on... Bottom line: Great pool and location, but find another hotel without the resort fees.

We had two double rooms. One with a view and one without. No problems with noise, but we did have one guy who tried to follow us into our room (VERY DRUNK) and we got rid of him and notified security. I have to say that the rooms were clean, we really did not hear alot of noise. Food - There are multiple restaurants and fast food outlets. The fast food outlets are at least double the price of your average free standing location at home. I think a foot long at subway was $10 for the $5 and then $12 for the 'premium'. The Dragon Noodle restaurant has really good dimsum for lunch and they participate in the buy a coupon to get $xx off your total purchase of $xx or more. We did the costs and on lunch for 4, we easily save $40 off the total by buying the $5 discount. Tix4tonight sells them and they are just about across the street at the Coke bottle. Valet parking - was close conveinent at quick. Never really had a long wait. Pool - very small for the property and got very crowded very quickly. Also, like all properties on the strip, the pool closes at 6 or 7pm. In the middle of summer? Seriously? It isn't even like the sun has gone down and it is dark. Biggest irritation about this property and all MGM properties is the daily resort fee. It was $20 a day here (it is more or less depending on the property you stay at) Casino was eh....never really won anything and they did not have the most current and/or popular slots.

It is a nice hotel and the staff were very friendly. The room was nice, clean like a regular hotel room. LOCATION: It is located quite south on the strip so you will have to do a bit of walking to see the other resorts. I would recommend using the free tram which has two stops: the Aria and Bellagio area casinos. The monorail system which you have to pay for from the MGM across the street is not that useful if you are staying here. The amount you have to walk just to get to it, is not worth it. Using the free one from the Monte Carlo and then walking up to the Wynn area is free and the walking will be about the same. There is a CVS (I think that is what the letters were - sorry not from US) and pharmacy across the street so you can pick up any forgotten necessities. MEALS: There is a McDonalds, Starbucks, Subway and a couple of other fast food type places located in the hotel. We did eat at the steakhouse in the hotel \"BRAND\" which was really good, my husband did the \"Wine around the World\" with dinner and it was presented very well and the staff and service was excellent! The hickory smoked mashed potaotes were REALLY GOOD! If you have dined at Gothams in Vancouver it is very similar both in price and meal style. We also ate at the Bellagio Buffet for breakfast (on a Monday - which is different than the weekend buffets). It was good and the service was very good as well. PRICE: The Monte Carlo was a nice clean place - nothing fancy and on par with the other hotels of the same level as far as price goes. The water in the pool was $8.25 a bottle which is CRAZY and you can't take anything in so beware of that. There is also a mandatory resort fee which wasn't much but really???? Just incorporate into your rates so your customers don't feel like they are paying for something that they are not using. Also no coffe makers so you will want to visit Starbucks in the morning.

We had about 20 people booking rooms for my wedding that was being held outside of the city. I had worked with a guy in the group booking department named Dan and I cannot express how rude this man was. He was not helpful and had a terrible attitude the entire time I worked with him. The only reason I stayed with the Monte Carlo was because it was a decent group price and it wasn\u2019t a young hip casino where the older guests wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable. The day my family and I checked in they were changing computer systems and the line to check in was incredibly long. By the time we got up there and checked into one of the rooms, they claimed they didn\u2019t have the second room booked under my father\u2019s name. Since he made both of the reservations the at the same time, I hardly think it was an issue on our part. So, after an HOUR! the woman checking us in had to go and get her manager who basically made us beg and thank him for \u201callowing\u201d us to still use the group booking price for the room reservation that they lost. The pool was fun because it had a lazy river and wave pool but the music was disgustingly loud, and I'm still in my 20's and thought that!! The positives were that the rooms were clean and comfy and I spoke with a woman in the concierge department who helped me look for limo services to and from the wedding. I ended up finding a cheaper price through a different service, but I couldn\u2019t have been happier with how helpful and nice she was. The bellhops and valet guys were super friendly as well. After the check-in fiasco I was so turned off by the casino that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d end up staying here again, but for it being in a great central location on the strip, having nice clean rooms at a good price, it\u2019s certainly a decent option.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location on the Las Vegas strip\u201d", "Author": "TStewart30", "ReviewID": "UR115477767", "Content": "On a February 2011 trip to Las Vegas we chose the Monte Carlo because of its location and the price deal we got.

The Spa is nothing more than a hot tub, suana and steam room. There is no luxury about it. The Bellagio and Encore Spas are a retreat where you could spend all day as a queen. Here, I lasted 10 minutes. What a disappointment. As for my massage, it was awful. Not sure how that is possible. Each move was deliberate.

The Monte Carlo is one of my favorite hotels on the south end of the strip. I\u2019ve stayed here three times before. This time, I stayed in a Monaco Suite, room 22-101 on June 22, 23 and 24. The direct flight from my home airport arrives at 10:30 AM so I arrived at the hotel at about 11:15. Went to the front desk and within 5 minutes was being serviced. I began with an apology for being so early and was told that it was not a problem and they plan for early arrivals and, within 10 minutes more and a nice $20 tip for the clerk for being so helpful, I was in my room. Upon entering the room to the right of the door is a closet with iron and ironing board as well as slippers, but no robe. You will find 2 folding suitcase stands and plenty of hangers. Next to the closet is a half bath with a sink and a toilet for guests. To the left is a nice piece of furniture that holds glasses and an ice bucket. This is a good place to leave non-perishables upon entering. Further into the room is a nice flat panel TV and a couch, which is NOT a hide-a-bed, and coffee table. Beyond that, by the window is a small table and two chairs where you can sit and eat take out food or room service. Turning right, you see a desk and chair as well as the king size bed and two night stands. The bed is very comfortable and should give anyone a good night\u2019s sleep. Heading over to the bathroom, you will also find a small reading table and chair. The bathroom has one sink. The shower is in a jetted bathtub and the toilet is behind its own door for privacy which, when shut, reveals a wall safe. The jetted tub worked great and I was able to enjoy it one evening. All in all, the room is a nice size, very functional, and the windows were clean! There was a wire for the internet which I plugged into my laptop, but the connection did not work. They\u2019ve been making improvements but did not tell me. Turns out that when I turned on my wireless signal, this room now has a wireless connection and a wired connection is no longer necessary. This was great news and my ipod had no problem going out and getting the connection as well. If I was staying in a Caesars property, I would have been charged over $28/night for this amenity. The cost is included with the $16.80 resort fee, an $11 savings over Caesars. Yea! Now for what was bad about the room. The Monaco suites do need a total makeover. Are they horrible? Not by any means. However, ALL of the furniture in this room has been patched with putty, and painted, and sometimes patched and not painted so many times that it appears they finally gave up and you can now see the scratches and missing pieces of wood in the furniture and gashes in the walls and the door. I don\u2019t understand how slats of wood can be missing from under the glass top of the nightstand. The knob of a door on the credenza was missing and just the screw is left pointing out from the door as if in wait to tear through someone\u2019s flesh when they unknowingly walked by. The fabric on the couch cushions has been stretched beyond belief. See photos for the above. If you pay $100 a night for a room, you should expect to feel like I were the first person in the room, not the 1000th. Customers expect more from a suite. A few more things about the hotel: The public areas were cleaner than my past visits. Either they are doing a better job or there were less crazy people at the hotel this time. I believe the former since the hotel was packed with folks in town for some Electric Daisy Carnival rave party. I\u2019ve heard there are noise issues at the Monte Carlo. My room did not face the pool so I can not say anything about noise from there, but the sound of the ads in the elevator does not need to be as loud as it is currently set. It is not enough for people to go running into the streets as some might make you think, but it is a bit annoying being effectively yelled at every time you\u2019re in the elevator. Also, while playing Black Jack in the Casino, the booming from the base from the entertainment at Brand (around 11 PM) was way out of line to the point where I really could not concentrate on my play and had to stop. I liked the new store \u201cLick\u201d and of course who doesn\u2019t like \u201cThe Cupcakery\u201d. The Pool area is really good since they have three pools to choose from, a regular pool, a wave pool and a lazy river. On top of that, they have a small pool that you can rent for a small party. I did become sick during my stay, but not from anything at the Monte Carlo. (Don\u2019t buy salads from the ABC store!) However, I\u2019ve never had a \u201cbad\u201d stay at the Monte Carlo and this stay was no different. Even though I was out of commission for two days and a night, I still managed to have a good time there. All staff members were great, from check-in to M-life desk to Business center that helped me print out my boarding pass. I\u2019m happy to still be able to recommend Monte Carlo as a nice place to stay in Las Vegas, but the Monaco suites do need to be renovated if they are going to continue to charge $90 - $100 and up.

We chose the Monte Carlo primarily because we wanted a nice pool, while trying to avoid the pool party scene at some of the newer mega-hotels. We read online that it probably had one of the better kiddie pools. It helped that the Monte Carlo was also cheaper compared to many of the other MGM Resorts hotels. We were in a standard room on the back side of the hotel. Frankly, it was really nothing special. The hotel's slogan is \"Unpretentiously Luxurious\". Unpretentious, yes. Luxurious, no. The bed was nice enough but the bathroom was definitely dark and tired. It had the classic signs of a worn room -- water drained poorly, rust stains under the sink, just adequate showerhead. The room size is also average at best, and compares very unfavorably to places llke the Venetian. It was not a bad room ... just not a great one. The room was clean, so that's not a concern. About that pool. It is definitely a really nice pool. There's a wave pool (just like Mandalay Bay), as well as a \"lazy river\" (just like the MGM Grand) that you can float down on a inner tube. However, I think that the kiddie pool is actually gone. Some old reviews speak of five pools, including the separate kiddie pool. But the hotel now appears to have just *four* pools. It was also louder and party-like than I had hoped for. I still had a good time at the pool, and spent many hours there. It just wasn't exactly what I had expected. The other common facilities exceeded my expectations. Check-in and check-out were much faster than I had experienced previously at other Vegas hotels, and the self-parking lot is relatively nearby -- across a bridge and down a set of escalators puts you right in the lobby. The breakfast buffet is pretty good, and the fine dining restaurant (Andre's) was excellent with great service. You can also take a tram to Aria/City Center and Bellagio so you don't have to get into the car as much.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money for what you get\u201d", "Author": "lorrainedave489", "ReviewID": "UR115165103", "Content": "Stayed two nights in June 2011.

We got the high level floor we had booked and 2 queens (booked a king- but that was ok). Concierge was very friendly, and room seemed clean on first appearances. Despite being fairly happy with the room, we found the casino extremely smokey and the roulette staff very unfriendly. We are roulette rookies and when we asked for some explanation, we kind of got ridiculed. There was one woman there who blatantly \u00a0couldn't count and everyone sat around her table was getting very frustrated. When a few of us explained that she'd given out the wrong number of chips, her and the boss guy started shouting at us even though they then realized they were wrong...kind of put a dampener on the rest of our evening! \u00a0The pool was nice, but always busy, and it was a struggle to find empty chairs. One day we were queuing for 45 mins at the bar to get a drink, even though there were only 5 people in front of us.

Nice hotel and great location. Rooms are very comfortable and bathrooms clean and well-appointed. Only negatives on the room were the thin walls - could hear neighbors next door and kids running down the hallway - and lack of coffeemaker in the room. Elevators are quick and always available - which says a lot in a large hotel on a holiday weekend. Front desk and concierge helpful and competent. Check-out and bag check were quick despite a huge crowd. The food court downstairs is convenient (Subway, Starbucks, McDonald's). We had a 2-for-1 deal and had the brunch buffet - good selection and a good value. Neither are fancy or \"foodie\" options but good to fill in other meals when you're looking for something affordable and/or quick. The buffet line can get very long, but we avoided this by going at 9:30. Casino is fun and lively without being too crowded. We found it to be the least smoky of the casinos we walked through. Pool area fun and lively - energetic DJ and good music. Still family-friendly. My sister and I reserved a basic pedicure and were surprised when we were told during the pedicure that the $50 charge did not include buffing the soles, etc! So be aware! We found that to be a bit tricky - an extra $20 to do what is normally part of a pedicure. Would have been better if they charged $70 upfront. Spa and fitness area very nice. We had access to the spa for the day and enjoyed the steam room, sauna etc. Location is fantastic. Easy walk to Aria and Crystals/City Center. Free tram takes you to Bellagio.

Instead of one large line they let people just stand around. Meaning if you happen to be behind someone taking forever to check in, then you'll take forever too. The room would be nice if everything in it wasn't so old. The comforter was worn down and had holes, the carpets were patchy, even the lampshade was filthy.

Our rate came with a room credit, which we used at the buffet. I love a Las Vegas buffet, but this was nothing special. Not really worth the price, even with the discount. An, to top it off, they called my room to tell me my credit card had been declined and I had one hour to come rectify it or they would remove us. Odd, I thought, as the room had been pre-paid.

Check-in isn't until 3 pm, but the valet said that we might be able to check it, it would just depend. The valet was friendly and so were the people who took our luggage. There were lines a mile long. On every open station, which was about five. My husband and I got in seperate lines to see if one would move faster than another. Not really. I understood that it was a Las Vegas hotel and it's busy, so I let the people behind me do all of the griping, and believe me, there was a lot. We finally made it to the check-in and I had my online confirmation. It was for a \"Strip View, at least on the 24th floor.\" Well, we got issued a room on the 30th floor, which I thought was great. We stood in line for 45 minutes and all I wanted to do was sit. We got to our room and it was not a strip view. It was a pool view. I called down to the front desk and they apologized and said to come get a new room. We didn't touch anything, left it clean and left. We had to stand in line for another 45 minutes. By now, it's around 3:30 pm, the normal check in time. I was informed that we could either wait for another hour and a half, or stay in the pool room. We decided to wait and go eat, since we paid for a strip view. We finally get into our room around 5:00 and I tested the safe. It locked, but it didn't open. We called the bell desk and they sent security. It took almost a half hour to get it fixed. And it still only worked half the time after that. Fortunately he showed us some tricks to open it if need-be, just push on the door and enter the code. That made me feel real safe.. not. The room we ended up in was an adjoined room. The people next to us had children that screamed and played loudly, well into the morning, around 2 am. I know hindsight is 20/20, but had we known this, we would have stayed in the pool view. That room had clean windows, our windows were filthy which makes for an interesting \"Strip View.\" The breakfast buffet was good. We didn't get a chance to make it to the Ice Bar and if I had to hear the elevator advertising Jabbawockeez one more time, I might have screamed.

Two married couples, (ages 28-33) two rooms, two reservations on a very limited budget. Our plane arrived at 11am so we were well before check in time of 3pm. However we thought we'd give it a shot and get in line once we arrived to the hotel. There was no real designated check in/check out lines but we didn't mind as the lines moved quick! The gal that checked us in was super friendly and told us she was sorry but being that we were early our rooms weren't ready yet (2 king non-smoking rooms) we could come back later or she could get us into 2 double non-smoking rooms. We asked if they were adjoining (we didn't request this, but thought we'd give it a go and ask!), they were not, but she did have two rooms on the 12th floor that were side by side. We said that sounded great and took them! We didn't plan on being in our room much anyways. We also asked if they were running any promotions that we could get in on and we got BOGO buffets, BOGO tube rentals, BOGO roller coaster passes at the NYNY, and some more. We didn't need or use all of them, but hey, anything extra at no additional cost is wonderful! -Resort fee. Lets get it out of the way. Yes its silly and annoying. Why they just don't add it into the room total from the getgo is beyond me...but we knew about it in advance so we just factored it in and didn't allow it to ruin our experience. Our room with the resort fee was still cheaper than any downtown hotel in Chicago. -Our rooms faced the mountains/pool area and yes its true... Thursday thru Sunday they have a DJ at the pool and you can hear it in your room. But who cares! We weren't going to hang out in our room during the day anyways. Monday-Wednesday you don't hear the regular non-dj music from the pool in your room. I don\u2019t know why all the complaints about the towels/showers/etc. in the room. We had absolutely no qualms. They have a sign that they are trying to go green and a towel left on the floor will be replaced and a towel on the rack will be left to be reused. I think that\u2019s a great idea! Our shower worked fine and it felt great after a long day out and away from the room. -The pools themselves were great, and that lazy river was more fun without the tube than with it! Oh and it\u2019s true. If you carry a bag in they will inspect it to make sure you aren\u2019t carrying in any food/drinks. We just chugged some beer in our room then headed down to the pool. The only thing we found a bit silly was all the VIP chairs and cabanas that were never used. Yes I'm sure they wanted them available for those willing to pay for them, but they sort of look stupid just wasting space when people aren't paying for them. It\u2019s kind of like saying \u201cHey! We\u2019re overpriced and no one ever uses us!\u201d A touch wasteful in my humble opinion. -The casino was not what I expected. The reviews I read said the casino at the Monte Carlo was a dead zone and the machines/tables didn\u2019t pay out well at all. I beg to differ. My husband and I played Game King machines for hours on end. He came out ahead on his money and I lost ten dollars total in 5 days. Not to shabby for non-gamblers. The waitresses came around very often and we tipped $1 a drink and it was well worth it. Those gals work fast and were very very kind. If you aren\u2019t a member, go to the M Life desk and sign up for their card. You earn points and those points help you get free/comped things. We used our card at the Monte, MGM, NYNY, Bellagio, and Excalibur. -There is a free tram thru the shopping area that will get you all the way down the strip to the Bellagio. We used this when our feet were tired, which was quite often. You can also walk to the Excalibur and take a similar free tram all the way down to the Mandalay Bay which was equally nice and so convenient! -The hotel is in such a great location. Walk next door to the NYNY and take the bridge over to the MGM or Excalibur and from either of those places you can get to the Tropicana. There is a CVS in front of the hotel and an ABC store directly across the street. Both stores have most anything you need that you might have left at home. Los Salsa Cantina also across the street had a $3.95 morning breakfast with $.99 bloody mary drinks. It was a great inexpensive meal and we went there 3 of our 5 mornings. We had Catalina as a server...fabulous lady! Way better than hitting fast food for breakfast. But if you want fast food there is a Del Taco, Sbarro, DQ, Panda Express up an escalator right near Los Salsa Cantina. Also across the street near the M&M\u2019s world is a store called the Grand Canyon Experience (G.C.E.); this place rocks! They had 2/$2 16oz cold beers. A little hint if you\u2019re a drinker, buy their $4.95 cold bag and they\u2019ll fill it with ice for free and then you can take those beers back to your room and reuse the bag with the ice vending machine on your floor. Also at the G.C.E. with every purchase if you mention their sign that says a free 16.9oz water you\u2019ll get it for that\u2026free! Yes the store is mostly touristy for sale items, but we didn\u2019t mind. We were just on the lookout for deals! It was so nice to have those kinds of prices in such close walking proximity when on a strict budget. -Check out was really painless. The offered us to do express checkout, but I wanted a copy of our room bill (which by the way you can verify on your tv in your room to keep an eye on things). Once again there was no direction for check in/check out, but the line moved quickly once again and we were settled up and headed over to the concierge to leave our bags. The gentleman that checked us out was as equally polite as the gal that checked us in. Way to go Monte Carlo on getting such wonderful staff! Our flight wasn\u2019t to leave until later that night so we needed to check our bags for awhile. We tipped the bell man $1/bag (we had 12 altogether) and by george they were super fast to get our bags back out to us when the shuttle arrived! These are some of the most polite workers in a hotel we\u2019ve ever experienced and we\u2019ve travelled quite a bit domestically and internationally (and all on a budget I might add!). -With all this said, YES!

We booked a $500 spa suite and had been switched to a tiny room with two double beds. When we explained to the front desk agent that it was not what we had booked, she finally switched us to another spa suite room. The next day we had lunch at The Pub, and asked the waiter to bill our room since we had been told that we would receive a $50 credit.

After explaining our situation yet again, they finally honored the credit we had been promised.

Read the reviews on here and started to fear the worse. Firstly , the resort fee. Many of you will have read my thoughts on this extra in other posts. Speaking as a British holiday maker, this fee offers NOTHING of use to a holiday maker but makes good sense to some one attending Las Vegas for a working break, i.e conference. I can't see many British holiday makers wanting to ring local and toll free numbers. Nor can I see them wanting photocopying done or faxes sending. Internet that is supplied to the room via a cable is of no use as the majority of holiday makers don't travel with a lap top computer. They do , however use mobile phones with wifi, an extra charge. Check in was pretty quick and pleasent at around 9.15pm on Weds 15th June. Room was Strip facing, had two queen beds, a nice flat screen Tv, a clean bathroom and a comfy bed. However, I only made use of the room for one night as a couple with FOUR kids, all under the age of 10 ( I'm guessing here ) took the suite next door and the racket coming thru the dividing door was completely unacceptable. TAKE YOUR KIDS TO DISNEYWORLD, don't inflict them on other Adults who have come to a place that is meant for ADULTS. Front counter staff didn't bat an eyelid when I asked to change rooms and I was impressed by their willingness to sort out my problem. Higher floor, better strip view and one Kingsize. Stayed at the Bellagio many times as well as the Flamingo , Imperial, Mandalay Bay, Tropicana and Rio but certainly feel the staff were more helpful at the M.C. Wanted to use the pool but the sheer volume of noise being created by the poolside disco coupled with how cram packed it was, put me off. Pity as I do like to sit by the pool, have a read, listen to my iPod. The Buffet was not as good as I remember it from around 4 years ago when I last used it. The signs of cutbacks are all to clear with very limited choices now and breakfast rolled in to lunch , leaving just two meals a day. I\"m a slot player and I found plenty of different machines to occupy me in the M.C's casino. I would, however, point out that in 4 days and nights there, I was only offered a drink on one occassion. There just didn't seem to be any cocktail waitress's around. I was all so left speech less on Sat night. I like to have a flutter on the Wheel of fortune ( lazy betting, I know ) but at 9pm it was closed. There was a lady with it who told me it would be opening any minute but after 10 minutes, I got up and walked away. An hour later I was walking back past it so stopped to have a go. This time they were changing spinners and would I wait a while whilst they sorted out the chips and changed over. No wonder they need Resort fees when you can't give your money away in the casino !! Overall, M.C is not a dump by any means. It's not lacking in facilities. It's nice and central on the strip. Warning for British pint drinkers though... The Pub had a good selection of English beers but at $10 for a pint !!! That was around \u00a36.00 at my exchange rate. Blimey, it makes London pub prices look like good. The Hotel staff are helpful and friendly. There is a nice food court all though the Starbuk's closes at 11pm leaving you to drink the dish water serves McDonalds up.

Having seen many programmes on Vegas we were expecting glitz & glamour from the start. The hotel lobby was large & airy & check in was quick with the reception staff being friendly. We paid extra for a Deluxe room on a high floor & were given a double room on the 23rd floor overlooking the pool. Note to readers - if you find you have a room overlooking the pool change it immediately!! Don't even try it for one night! More later on why. The room itself was not we had in our minds from the internet pictures of the hotel. It did the job for somewhere to stay but not the luxury we had imagined. Having later seen our friends rooms I definatly think we had a bum deal. The beds was comfortable but mine was saggy in the middle on one side. The decor was contemporary but looking tired in places and there was a rust stain on the floor in the bathroom under the sink. The shower was powerful but, when on, the bath tap also sprayed out water so the mixer switch did not work well. The plug sockets wobbled when you plugged things in, they looked quite unsafe! Beds were made daily, bins were emptied and towels were changed. The ipod dock mentioned only fitted one of our 4 ipod/iphones the slim line 8G, none of the others fitted nor did my iphone. The in room safe was hilarious! Imagine a size just wider than an A4 box file and then stand it up. This was the safe!! You had to balance everything on its sides & place around the edges & quickly shut the door. Then it would not close as the safe door was quite deep taking up precious space in the safe itself. We only had a small jewellery box, travel wallet, purses, passports & ipods and could not get much more in. If you had a laptop or notebook you would get nothing else in, if you could even get them in! The hotel facilities were very good, several bars, shops, restaurants and food outlets plus an array of machines & tables in the Casino. We ate at Andre's restaurant for the night of our friend's wedding. We had a private dining room for our party & the service & food were outstanding. Everyone enjoyed their meal & the staff were friendly but not intrusive. Some of the party during the stay also ate in the 'Cafe' & the buffet restaurants & all mentioned the food was good there too. We also ate at Diablo's out the front of the hotel, the Nachos were massive & very tasty! They have a drinks offer that changes every 30mins or so. On a weekend evenings it changes to a bar/club & costs $10 to get in. The pool choices were good, a lazy river, wave pool, spa pool & standard pool. For the lazy river you had to buy or hire a ring to ride on. I think it was $12 to hire for the day or $16 to buy one to keep. You could go round without a ring if you wanted. They played music in the pool area which was ok earlier on in the day but by lunchtime/afternoon it was far too loud, drowned out everything! This is the reason why if you have a room overlooking the pool I would highly recommend getting it changed! When we arrived, the first 3 days we were out the room from 9/930am & not back till 7/8/9pm so were unaware of the noise from the pool. However on our 4th/5th days we spent these at the hotel & found the music to be so loud even on the 23rd floor it was clearly heard & louder than the TV & made it impossible to relax in the room. I did go down & complain to the Concierge who in my opinion was a complete waste of space. He just shrugged his shoulders, agreed it was rather loud & that's how it was! Other persons in our group changed their rooms after one night due to this but as we only has two nights left we didn't bother, not that we were given the option had we wanted to! I could understand if it was spring break or similar but there was no one 'partying' down by the pool area, everyone was chilling, reading & relaxing including the teenagers/college aged kids. I've lived in Magaluf & not experienced it on that scale! It was a shame that there was no fridge facility in the room, this would have been a great addition. There was ice facility near the lifts but trudging up & down the corridors to get it was a pain especially as we were at the far end. The air conditioning in the room worked well & was adjustable to suit. There are computers at the far left of the lobby area where you can check in & print your boarding passes for free. It comes up as a charge when you press print but there is no fee. I believe there was in room WiFi but this was not used as we had nothing to access it with us. All in all we enjoyed our trip to Las Vegas & I will defiantly be coming back but having seen many of the other hotels & what they have to offer I think I will choose one of them for my next visit over the Monte Carlo.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, good casino, awesome experience\u201d", "Author": "mkoiki", "ReviewID": "UR113373606", "Content": "Well known resort, not much new to post here..

It was not my first choice (we had stayed here before) but we got a good rate from their website in addition to the AAA discount. The other reason for choosing it was its location on the strip for the first time Vegas visitor we were travelling with. We arrived/checked in at 8:30 in the morning and were told we wouldn't be able to get the key to our room until between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. The hotel did keep our luggage and we spend the day walking the strip. I think we eventually got in after 5:00 but that was partly due to wanting to wait for the room we requested (floor 31 overlooking the pool) and because the previous guests left without checking out. The view from the room (31112) was well worth the wait. We looked out to the Aria and Cosmopolitan and had a strip view in the distance. The night time views were great for photos. The room itself was just basic but clean. I never did find a hairdryer. We used the pool once. The lazy river and the wave pool are a nice feature of this hotel considering the price. The only other hotel with a wave pool is the Mandalay Bay which is generally much more expensive. There is also a sand volleyball court which seemed popular. The downside at the pool is you have to rent the rubber rings at $10 a day or $25 a week. We didn't bother. We had drinks and appetizers in the Pub. They were both good. We just couldn't believe they closed at 11:00 on week nights. We had coffee in the nicer of the two Starbucks in the hotel which is at the base of the tram stairway. They don't take the pre-loaded Starbucks cards which I didn't discover until it came to paying. We didn't go back. For breakfast we ate at McDonald's in the food court. It was more expensive than at home but was fast and the same quality of food as you would get at any McDonalds. They did charge extra for coffee when you order breakfast platters which are included at our locations here but that is Vegas! The hotel frontage is pretty and the pool areas are nice but the casino is dark and was very quiet compared to all the others we visited. I think the lack of a theme makes it less interesting for visitors than many other hotels on the strip. When booking our stay I found 2 out of 3 reservations people I dealt with were very unhelpful (one lady made me find the discount code I was quoting as she said the deal had ended. It had not. On the other hand the one person asked if we had a AAA card and got us the extra discount.) When calling the front desk if you mentioned the word \u2018reservation\u2019 they transferred you without letting you ask a question.

The carpet was soiled and stained to the point I didn't want to walk in the room in bare feet; I found a used kleenex behing the curtain which remained there for the duration of our 3-day stay; the toilet flush mechanism was broken; there were water/dirt stains along the baseboards of the bathroom; there was a visible buildup of dust / grit in the bathroom vent above the toilet and around the fire sprinkler in the ceiling; and finally, there were what looked like food stains and a shoe print in the ceiling of our room. To their credit though, I was relieved to find the bedding to be clean. The towels and face cloths however, had an unpleasant industrial odor when wet. As we were only in Las Vegas for 3 days and the bed was clean enough to sleep in, we opted to overlook the overall shabbiness of the room. The final straw though was when I was denied entrance to the pool area because I had 3 unopened bottles of water in my bag. I can understand not bringing in alcohol but they were turning away paying guests who had water or coffee in their hands! Apparently the Monte Carlo is hurting for money so badly they demand you pay their over-inflated prices for bottled water poolside! Again, I had never experienced this at the MGM Grand so was deeply offended and shocked that the Monte Carlo would treat their customers in this manner. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to the Monte Carlo and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cToo Good To Be True\u201d", "Author": "akcountess", "ReviewID": "UR112801210", "Content": "We go to Las Vegas several times a year, but have never stayed here before.

Nothing grand, but it was exactly what we asked for and right in budget. One bad thing was that the toilet wasn't working but we understand that things happen and they were nice about it. It took maintenance until 11:30pm to come fix the problem which was a bit annoying but there was a restroom downstairs and we wanted to peruse the casino anyway. We went to sleep early, exhausted after a long day of traveling, and woke up at 4am to a violent, physical fight from the couple next door (enough to wake 4 people up from a dead sleep). We called the front desk and from there I'm not sure what happened, but the fighting stopped. The only gripe I have was the pool. The drinks were unbelievably expensive and you couldn't even take water in. The guards at the front touched everything in my bag, opened up my towel, etc. to make sure that no food was in there. Hello, this isn't a matter of national security and I felt very uncomfortable having someone going through everything in my pool bag (there was a towel, a Kindle, my cell phone, room key, and ID....why did it take several minutes?). Not cool and left a very bad taste in my mouth. Other than that, I love that there was a Starbucks downstairs, the DJ at the pool was so fun, Donovan (the security officer) was wonderful and even gave us hugs on our way out and I can honestly say that we would come back because of him. We never ate at the restaurants but we did see the Jabbawockeez show. Because a Cirque show wasn't in the budget, I felt a bit like I was \"settling\" just because it was cheaper but once the show was over, my jaw was still hanging open. It was THAT good! I would recommend it to anyone and I'm so glad that we saw it. Worth every penny! So overall, I would definitely recommend the Monte Carlo and will most likely be back.

The official policy of the Monte Carlo seems to be to pump up the dance music as loudly as they possibly can, in both the pool area and the casino. There's no area in the pool complex in which you can avoid the music. It was already too loud, but then at noon on both Saturday and Sunday, a DJ came out and cranked the volume of the bass heavy music up to 11.

When we got a great room rate offer e-mailed to us from Monte Carlo, first thing I did was read reviews. It has been around for awhile, but is still well kept and modern.

As always, I'll give a totally honest review of everything I think is relevant. 1. The Hotel Although this is one of the older hotels, everything was really clean. Unlike some of the others, we didnt need a sat nav to find our room from reception. The room was a good size, really clean with a really big and comfortable bed. Big wide screen TV with good channel choice.The safe was free to use and a good enough size to keep things like valuables and wallets in it. The bathroom was clean and the shower was pretty good. Again, it was all very clean and the room will be cleaned every day (unless you're in it when they turn up obviously). 2. The Casino Really nice casino. Not sprawling and all over the place like some of the other hotels (planet hollywood etc). Waitresses were really friendly and always kept coming back with more drinks. Plenty of tables/machines to keep you entertained. 3. The pool This is the only slight criticism. The pool area is not very big compared to some others and there is always a queue at 9am when they open up. Most of those people would just go in at 9 and leave their towels on the loungers and then disappear off for breakfast or whatever else. It took a couple of days to find the best sun loungers where you were guaranteed to get a decent amount of sun. Lots of palm trees around the whole pool area means that you need to be very careful about being blocked out. I can see it being more of an issue in the off season when the sun is lower. It was really busy over the weekend and there were lots of people without loungers who just had to hang around on the edge of the pool. Quite a lot of loud music but it was good music so didn't bother us at all. 4. Facilities Check in was pretty quick and friendly. The food court was handy for lunchtimes or a cheap evening dinner. \"The Pub\" does excellent food and it's quite reasonable. The burgers are highly recommended. There are 2 Starbucks (as the rooms don't have coffee making facilities), and both were quite busy in the mornings. The concierge was really helpful and helped us to find places we were looking for by printing off maps, directions and bus timetable for the Duece Bus. There is a tram connecting the Monte Carlo with the new city centre hotels and the Bellagio which is really handy. It's also free. 5. Overall experience. As always, you get what you pay for. We got 9 nights (including flight) for \u00a31600. I really couldn't complain about anything to be honest, we really enjoyed our time there. Yes it may be a bit more dated than some of the other hotels on the strip, but only by Vegas standards. The staff were friendly, all the facilities (including the room) were really clean and it had everything you need. The ONLY annoying thing (and this is nothing to do with the hotel) is there there isn't a single book store on the strip. The 2 that are in the brochures have both closed down (mandalay bay and Fashion Show mall). We managed to find a Borders in the new Town Square development south of the strip (about 10 minutes on the Duece Bus).

With some many other hotels being closer to the strip, and the Monte Carlo being placed further back, you did get to see some of the strip, but not as much as I had hoped. But that's ok, at least I didn't have to look at a parking lot. The location on the strip is good, as you can get anywhere you want from there walking or on the trams that run between the like owned hotels. The room was basic, clean with enough room for the two of us not to trip on on another. My one beef about the room is the bathroom. Over the sink is well lit, but the shower is another thing. First off, the shower head is quite low so I had to put it up as far as it would go and duck to get my head wet. Secondly, the shower is so poorly lit that I had to figure out how to shave my legs without it looking like a murder scene, but this too was overcome with a little creativity. Our room was made up every day with new lotion, shampoo etc. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. Our TV did not work upon arriving, and it took the fellow just a few minutes to come up and repair it which was fine because we were waiting for our luggage.

The 24 hour food court is a bonus! You can eat after a long night with no waiting. I you go, you must go to the Japanese Noodle house!! The portions are huge, and the calamari is devine.

We paid slightly more to upgrade to a Monaco Suite and we were very happy with the room overall. The rooms are HUGE and are located just by the elevators so are very convenient. There were a couple of scratches on the furniture which showed its age a little but this did not really bother us. The decor was pleasant and the bed was large and very comfortable. We also suffered with burnt smelling towels but it was a minor issue for us. We were placed on the 4th floor which i was initially very disappointed by and they had no other rooms available to be able to move us. However, we had a view over towards NYNY so it wasn't so bad and we had the added bonus of being able to get wifi! The Monte Carlo doesn't advertise the availability of wifi but I know some other people have been able to get it. Therefore if wifi is important to you, try asking for a low floor as our friends on the 22nd floor could not get it. The location of the hotel is good and as such we spend very little time there. We only ate once, at Starbucks, for breakfast and we didn't gamble there at all. We used the pool twice and had not problems getting loungers as long as we wanted to sit in the shade, which we did. We used the self park garage as its is very convenient and just a short walk across a walkway on the second floor to get to the hotel lobby. I had no really issues with the hotel but if we came to Vegas again we would probably stay somewhere else.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NH", "Title": "\u201cFavorite place to stay and inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "Shelley07", "ReviewID": "UR111200752", "Content": "This was our second time staying at this resort and we will be returning annually.

It turned out that they play music at the pool from Noon-5pm on Thursday through Sunday, so if you like to sleep during that time make sure you get a room not facing the pool.

It's always had a great location and with the new improvements and reopened tram, figured it would be a good time. It's still a nice place but I must now rank it as the loudest of any hotel I've stayed due to the music they have going at various locations. My room was on the 23rd floor overlooking the pool so every morning at 10:00AM they would turn on music in the pool area which would stay on until about 4;00PM. Even on the 23rd floor, it was so loud thru closed windows, you would have to raise the volume of the radio or TV set in your room if on. However where this really bothered me was the fitness center. The music there was so overwhelming, I could not listen to my own Ipod. I went to the desk to ask the attendant to turn it down and had to raise my voice to actually get his attention. He advised that they have no control over the volume, it's a management decision.. Several other people I met in the gym also complained. It was absurdly loud for what is a relatively small room. Since going to the gym daily is something I enjoy, this issue really put a damper on my stay and my opinion of the hotel. Too bad, because otherwise it's very nice. Had a great massage in their salon, their buffet is much improved and I really liked the new sushi bar. The staff is professional and friendly, rooms comfortable and clean, and I had great luck in the casino.

Also, there was what appeared to be cleaning solution on the bathroom door that wasn't totally wiped up. The casino is a nice size, but not extravagant.

The first thing I would like to say is that it is an older hotel on the strip so it is pretty plain jane compared to other hotels on the strip. Our experiece with checking in and checking out was fabulous and when ever we needed help with anything the hotel staff was very good in helping us, I really have No complaints about this hotel except for the fact that is was a bit older. The BEST part of the hotel is the location, it is dead center on the strip and right next to City Center which is beautiful in every way, there is also a mono rail that runs all the way to the Bellagio which was great. Staying in Vegas we did notice that you only spend about 6-8 hours in your room only to sleep so we came to the conclusion that staying at Monte Carlo was perfect for the price,if you plan on staying longer in your room or your just a baller then it would be better to get a nicer hotel like the Cosmopolitan at City Center which was awesome. All in all a great hotel for the money... And spending New Years in Vegas with friends is too much Fun.

I stayed with 3 girlfriends at the MonteCarlo..we had three double rooms on the 13 th floor. I thought the room was clean ( even the bathroom) and the beds were comfortable but .the carpet was dirty looking and it was rather gross to walk around in barefeet. We were in a room that faced the pool and everyday at precisely 9:00 am they began playing loud club music which just increased in volume as the day wore on. If you are a light sleeper and don't feel like getting up at 9am request a room that does not face the pool. The pool was packed on the weekend and very hard to get a seat together with my friends, because the majority of the seats had been \"reserved\" by towels and left to sit for the rest of the day. The music is so loud you might as well forget about having a conversation with anyone even the person in the next seat. You cannot bring any food or drink into the pool...well most people can't...some people got in with their Starbucks others had to drink it outside the pool area. Don't even think about bringing in your own bottle of water...they won't let you because they want you to pay the $5 to buy it. The slushy drinks are expensive....$11 if you get a small glass...I think the \"boot\" was much cheaper at $16.....but wow...sometimes you just don't feel like drinking that much ..just be prepared to pay for the privilege of getting a small drink. After walking through the other hotels I got the distinct feeling I was staying at the poor cousins place. There isn't much in the way of interesting things to look at, very few shops just very unspectacular...no big grand Vegas feel to it. Also, you'd think you could get some food somewhere after 10pm....no. Just in the Caffe. They stop serving food at 10 in all the other places. The Pub was good...lots of nice beers and great $1 sliders for happy hour and Diablo's make a great Margarita. ( $39/jug) The casino?? Well I don't know...I have never gambled before....but the other hotels just felt nicer and less dingy. I know that this was a cheaper option and if it all you can afford then you will probably enjoy yourself, but if you can splurge even a bit more...go somewhere you'll remember.

The casino, the lobby, and the public areas seem to sparkle. And the location is still hard to beat. The Pub, no longer brewing beer, now has a tremendous menu of beers from around the world with many on tap. But the bad...Unfortunately, the Monte Carlo is starting to show it age in several places, specifically the rooms. We stayed in a deluxe guest room (7th floor), and our friends were in a Monaco Suite also on the 7th floor. The Monaco Suite had been remodeled but the remodel was poor; cheap furnishing. The deluxe room was so beat up I don't know where to start. The windows were so filthy we could not see out of them. The noise from the street (we were on the 7th floor and it still penetrated the room) and through the paper-thin walls required us to purchase earplugs to sleep. We also had a terrible sewage smell that crept into the bathroom each day in the morning, then again in the afternoon. It never stayed, however. It was more annoying than intrusive.

Stayed Tuesday thru Saturday May 10-14 in room 7-227. My wife reserved two rooms for us and our travel companions. Requested adjoining King bed rooms but upon check-in our friends had to settle for two queens on the same floor. When they went to their room, other guests were already in the room! So after much ado, our friends were re-assigned a new room on a new floor. This entire process took about 45 minutes. The front desk staff, though courteous, said that they had a \"new software\". If so, it stunk and there were new trainees all over the front desk that knew nothing so the process took FOREVER. Several times electronic room keys did not work. The room was actually OK but upon arrival, we had to call for new bed linens as there seemed to be a large brown stain (blood?) on our top sheet. Housekeeping was there in a flash. The room walls are VERY thin. My wife heard one couple apparently enjoying themselves very much and another night I was awakened several times by guys partying and yelling in a room nearby. I was so tired I didn't even care. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows are like HUGE bricks. Did not eat the buffet so can't comment there but the $1 happy hour burger sliders and wings at the PUB were good as was our dinner at the Cafe (comped by the front desk for all the foul-ups on check-in). Positives? The Tram to Bellagio can get you down the strip quickly. Go past the pub and upstairs to get it. Go out the front of the hotel (through the casino) and a 24 hour CVS is right there. You can actually buy water, food and tobacco for regular prices. Prices at all the strip hotel gift shops are like the airport and cinemas. I refuse to pay $4 for a bottle of H2O. The Monte Carlo is actually located in a good spot on the strip so the positives outweigh the negatives for this review. It could have been better but then again, it's what you are willing to do to get what you want. The only thing that really stuck in my craw was the $17 PER DAY \"resort fee\". What a bunch of crap. Just charge me for the room and be done with it. Hard wired ethernet cable to boot! No free wireless in today's day is against the rules! Once again, checkout took 40 minutes because my wife spotted that we had been overcharged by almost $50. I think they have to do a lot of what they do because their casino is not actually all that large compared to some of the others I saw. Anything below $10 blackjack is mostly unavailable on the strip hotels. If you find one here or there, they are always full. Go downtown to the Freemont Experience and gamble there. $5 blackjack if you get there before 3 or 4 p.m. After that, they raise the minimums as well but if you are lucky enough to be on the table, they grandfather you in at $5.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coquitlam, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNICE HOTEL, but...\u201d", "Author": "Judepude", "ReviewID": "UR108524206", "Content": "This was my second stay at Monte Carlo.

We choose Las Vegas for the wonderful climate, fabulous hotels, excellent shopping and varied nightlife. We usually divide out stay into two hotels, one towards the South of the strip (have stayed in Luxor, MGM, Bellagio and Monte Carlo) and one towards the North end (have stayed in the Palazzo and the Venetian). This was our fourth visit to the Monte Carlo but our first return for some four years. The Monte Carlo used to be one of our first choice hotels, but after this visit, I feel you can now do much better at this end of the strip. I will start with the positives: -Obviously the location has not changed and the hotel is in a good central position. Introduction of the free monorail gives easy access to City Centre and the Bellagio. -This resort doesn\u2019t have the theming or appeal of neighboring resorts and hence doesn\u2019t seem to get the same levels of foot traffic as say the Bellagio. This makes it appear relatively quiet and relaxed inside. -Even though they charge the ridiculous resort fee of $15+tax per night (to get a copy of USA Today, use the gym and print out your boarding cards when you leave), we still managed to get a decent rate. We paid around $120 a night for a Monaco suite, although we did book about 6 months in advance. Now onto the negatives: -Although we got a decent rate, the rooms and furniture are starting to look very tired. Some investment badly needed. -As you can read in many previous reviews, the room towels can badly smell of smoke. Come on Monte Carlo, if so many people are complaining do something about it !!!!! -With the City Centre development now complete, the pool area is now completely surrounded by buildings. Combine this with the way they arrange the sun beds and its like sitting in a car park. At this time of year the surrounding buildings also create a lot of shade, especially for the main pool. It\u2019s a shame because we used to really like this pool area. -New pool rules have been introduced since our last visit, which seem to lack any kind of logic. You now cannot sit by the edge of the pool; you are either in or out. Apparently this is for safety reasons but come on guys, apply some common sense. When we first got moved on, the pool was empty so what emergency access were we blocking? The lifeguards applied this rule ruthlessly throughout our stay, the only exception being to large groups of young males chugging beer\u2026..scared maybe? -Another new rule is you cannot bring any outside food or drink into the pool area, unless it was bought from Starbucks. We were told it was because they owned the onsite Starbucks but none of the others. I can understand this with alcohol and picnics but you couldn\u2019t even take your own bottled water. Surely this is a health risk given the Vegas climate. This rule is again ruthlessly enforced with bag searches. We even witnessed a stroppy attendant telling a lady with medical issues that it was like turning up at a bar with her own beer. -The music played by the pool is loud. In addition, there is a DJ on Thurs-Sun who is even louder, although this was not an issue for us, but could be with some other visitors. Its almost like they\u2019ve changed their target audience for the pool from couples/families to the weekend party crowd. We did visit some of their on site restaurants (The Pub, Diablo\u2019s and D.Vino). The Pub and Diablo\u2019s are pretty much what you\u2019d expect from the price however D.Vino was disappointing. There was a limited menu choice, the staff all dressed in denim (for a slightly upmarket Italian restaurant???), the room was too bright and had no atmosphere. It was kind of like sitting in someones Dining Room! For a similar menu and price, we\u2019d recommend the Wolfgang Puck Brasserie in Crystals. Far superior on all accounts! In summary, if you are after an average hotel with a good location, don\u2019t mind sunbathing in a car park, and are happy to smell a bit singed when you\u2019ve dried yourself with the towels provided, this is a good option. We, however, will not be returning and will be looking for a higher standard of accommodation and facilities in a similar location on the Strip.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hb", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "Vihoney27", "ReviewID": "UR107315902", "Content": "Where should I start....we asked for a non-smoking room and as we walked to our floor, the first thing we smelled was weed and cigarettes.

My husband and I were able to check in to our room at 11 AM with no problems. Even if you have to wait, their policy is that check-in isn't until 3 PM so you should go in there expecting that. They can watch your bags if you can't check in and you should go explore. Our room was up to date just fine, had a flat screen, comfortable bed, and a nice view of the pool. The dragon noodle CO had really great food and the food court is just convenient. If you like slots, maybe venture to another casino and play their slots, I felt like nobody was really winning in the monte carlo.

My first trip was 5 years ago and every trip since the costs have gone up and the service has gone down. Now for the review. Location: Monte Carlo is in a pretty good location, with easy access to City center, and Bellagio via a free, quick, tram. It is also a short walk to New York New York. My only complaint about location is that it is almost impossible to cross the street in front of the hotel. It would be a long walk to things that are right across the street. Room: It was alright, nothing amazing, but no complaints either. Nice tv with few real channels, good view of the pool and city center. Food: They have a LOT of food options from cheap to expensive, from late night snack to full buffet. We ate at the Cafe a couple times for breakfast, food was ok, prices were about on par, the wait was unacceptably long considering there were at least 5 empty tables (still empty after we ate) also ate and drank at The Pub, food was good, drinks were good, prices were about new Vegas standard ($8 beer, $17 burger) Pool The website is a little misleading, the main pool is always in the shade, and much smaller in person, there's also a hot tub, wave pool (which was pretty cool) and a lazy river. The pool does not allow outside food or beverage, no not even a bottle of water. All in all the pool was pretty nice, it would have been a little nicer had the weather cooperated. Gaming Didn't play much, got too thirsty and moved to another casino (very limited cocktail service, but about on par with everywhere we went, see also: bad) Other things you should know $15 per day resort fee covers a daily newspaper, access to the gym, wifi, free local phone calls, and fax and copy service. Overall: I doubt I'll return to Las Vegas anytime soon.

The location is fantastic, making it extremely easy to get around the Strip to see shows, other hotels, etc. The pool area was our favorite part of the hotel and why I think the stay was worth the price we paid - we stayed on weekdays, so it wasn't extremely busy. They have a great wave pool and \"lazy river\" that we really enjoyed. The hot tub was pretty small, and the regular pool was in the shade so, so the water was too cold for us to swim in, but there was plenty of places to lay out to get a tan and enjoy the great weather. There are volleyball courts too, apparantly, but we didn't use them. However, after everything was said and done, besides alcoholic beverages a few slot machines, we did not eat or gamble at the Monte Carlo. They have very limited dining selections, and the ones they have aren't very good. The hotel isn't as big as some of it's neighbors, so it just can't accommodate much in the way of entertainment like Caesers Palace or the Venetian. The City Center next door has amazing dining spots, so I would recommend going there or further down the Strip to eat. The biggest problem that my husband and I had during our stay was a mix up in our rooms - and by rooms, I mean three different ones over a two-night stay. When we first arrived, we were put in a double-queen room that didn't have a view of the strip, even though we paid extra for a Strip view and we requested a king bed. We were immediately moved to a room on a higher floor with a view of the Strip, but they said that no King beds were available until the following night. The second room had four of the largest moths that I have EVER seen. My husband spent about 10 minutes hitting the gigantic bugs with a magazine before the poor things were all dead. Our TV also had issues, but the maintainence person was at our door within minutes to fix it. The next day, we were moved two rooms down the hall to a room with a king bed, an even better view of the Strip and, thankfully, no moths. The problem here was that our neighbors weren't having a good time, apparantly, and were SCREAMING at the top of the lungs at each other for hours and hours. We called security, who came up within minutes, but we had to call three more times and security didn't really do anything to resolve the problem except ask them to quiet down... which they didn't. We requested a late check-out on our last day and got 4 extra hours for $20. The bell desk held our bags (free) while we went to dinner and walked around the Strip.

One point - don't take any drinks to the pool as they don't let them in - pain for those going with yard glasses of alcohol. Can only assume its some sort of concession thing.

The Bad: The Monte Carlo does not guarantee that you will get a king bed room upon check in...so they tried to stick us with twin beds first telling us there was no availability for king size beds. So after speaking with a supervisor they sent us to another room...with a king that was horrible...smelled, wallpaper torn, cracked marble in the bathroom...so back to the supervisor. Then they sent us to another room on the 25th floor which was not great but better...the problem was it had not been cleaned...at 8:00pm at night...so again back to the supervisor...who promised it would be cleaned by the time we were back from dinner. Two hour delay getting all this worked out. Our friends also found their rooms to be bad. The rooms have old broken furniture, old beds, really beat up bathrooms. The hotel and casino real look rundown. Upon checkout I called the front desk and was confronted with one of the most disrespectful clerks I have ever spoke to, and they wanted to charge me $20 more dollars for one additional hour. I (again) asked for the supervisor and she gave me 3 additional hours no charge (like she does this often) They charge a $16 per day resort fee on top of your room rate and you receive nothing extra for this charge...even WiFi is not included. Went to the Italian restaurant and the meal was very poor. Pasta was just OK and the gourmet pizza was not cooked all the way and needed to be sent back. What is surprising is the the Monte Carlo also has Andre's Restaurant which is one of the best in Vegas. The Good: The location is one of the best in vegas but there are many other hotels that are MUCH BETTER within two blocks. The pool area was fun with a great DJ and the pool staff were great! Casino staff was very friendly. Conclusion: This hotel advertises that it is a luxury hotel which it is not.

We had forgotten to pack our camera charger and battery when we checked out. We had been charging the battery overnight and left it in on the wall socket, below the desk in the room. We had left the hotel around 9 am and realised we had forgotten the charger and battery when we were about to board the plane at 11am. We immediately called the hotel. We were put to lost and found, but no one picked up. We called several times and left several messages for the lost and found department. Yet, by the afternoon no one had returned our call. The only assurance was that the Reservations person who picked up my call told me that no one will be checking into our room for the day \u2013 to our relief as we thought this meant we would get our charger and battery back. When we finally managed to talk to someone from lost and found at 4pm (I had to keep calling; no one called back), I was told to call back again after 6pm when housekeeping had cleaned the rooms. So at 7pm I called the hotel again and was told to call back again in an hour\u2019s time so that the housekeeping could check the room again as no one had turned in anything. So once again I had to call back and LO AND BEHOLD! THEY HAD NOT FOUND MY ITEM! I was then told by the manager that they would do a second check in case the missing item was not logged onto the lost and found sheet. He assured me he would call me back in 5 or 10 minutes. After an hour, I heard nothing from the hotel! Again I had to call back! Again the manager told me that they have nothing but he had sent someone to re-check the lost and found box in case, and that he would call me back very shortly. LIES!!! BLOODY LIES!! Neither the manager nor anyone from the hotel called back!! By then I was in Canada and was unfortunately only halfway through my 3 weeks US / Canada trip with my husband. We desperately needed the charger and battery back, in order to work our camera for the remaining trip. We were even willing to pay for DHL to courier it to us in Canada if it was found. Imagine our desperation. HEED MY WARNING: This is by far the worst service ever. It is obvious that housekeeping or someone from the hotel had STOLEN MY CHARGER AND BATTERY, since the hotel had assured us that no one checked into our room for the day. NO ONE IN THE HOTEL WANTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE!! I had even told the hotel EXACTLY where the items were plugged into! No one even bothers to return a phone call!!

Paid $57/night plus daily resort fee. The lobby area is very nice. The room probably hasn't been updated since our last visit except for the nice flat screen (for some reason, the channels would change by themselves; must have been another room's remote control, happened to the other guests, too). Beds are soft but comfortable. Bathroom is large but in need of updates. Mirror was chipped, sink handle fell off, bath faucet wouldn't turn off. Housekeeping never left enough towels; had to call for more daily. Service was prompt. Rooms are not equipped for today's traveler. Few electric outlets for charging. Had to climb under the desk to find one. Few dresser drawers. Just not meant for 4 people staying 5 nights. As another reviewer noted, the towels often smelled burned and no fridge or microwave was a bummer. Our room had a hairdryer in the closet. I did not hear any noise from adjoining room, even the one we were connected to. No hallway noise at all. Nor were we bothered by the airplanes which were constantly overhead. Buffet dinner was average at best for $19.99. I guess that's pretty cheap. Nothing to write home about. Several booths had torn and frayed fabric. Definitely in need of a makeover. Had breakfast at The Cafe several times which was good but expensive. $75 for 4 on average for us. We ate and drank at The Pub several times. $7 for Corona. Or 5 for $25 at the pool (cans). Service at The Pub was spotty. One night no one came near us after we were given menus. We went to the bar for our drinks. Didn't seem to bother anyone nor did they seem to notice. Drinks at Brand steakhouse were very expensive but they were handing out BOGO coupons in the casino. Food court is a hit with the teens. Pools are nice but with the building of Aria and the giant gray monstrosity next to it, the sun is practically blocked out. Very crowded and difficult to get a chair if you arrive after 10am. Attendants said they walk around and remove towels off chairs if the guest didn;t leave any other personal belongings to mark their chair. We rented a cabana for a $400 commitment to food and drink. Best deal of the trip. Cabana is free as long as you spend $400 between 9am and 6pm. We spent $500 for 12 of us so it was worth it. $400 is the lowest price; charge more if its busy and more crowded. We rented it at noon. There's a private pool and cabana available for rent too which was interesting. We were told $500 rental fee plus $100/person in food and drink commitment. Its very nice.

My husband and I had stayed there in 2006 and were completely unimpressed, so I had a bad feeling about this trip as well. Priceline has nerve considering it a \"4 star hotel\" when every other source I've seen gives it 3 - 3 1/2 stars. If you are stuck with it like I was, it's not terrible, so don't freak out, but if you have the option to stay elsewhere in that price range do NOT book here to save a couple bucks. First, I'll start with the few good things, and there were a few, then discuss the negatives, and finally outline a few good things about the hotel that you can take advantage of without staying there. The Good: -the pool area is pretty decent. With a wave pool, a lazy river and a regular pool you have a lot of nice options. Also, the music & dj in the afternoon are fun (if you're into that type of thing, if you like a serene, quiet pool experience, this is NOT the place for you.) As with most hotels, the pool is crowded and people are jerks and lay claim to chairs they have no intention of using til later. Only thing you can do is be a jerk as well, go lay out some towels and come back when you're ready. - the staff we dealt with were all pleasant enough - the food court has decent options for a quick bite The Bad - the rooms are clean enough, but so unbelievably dated and worn, they appear dingy and depressing. - the beds dont have fitted sheets and the bottom sheet comes untucked and is all over the bed, pretty much as soon as you get in it. I don't really care to lay directly ON a hotel mattress (shudder) so this skeeved me out. -the mattresses are absolutely beat and not very comfortable - the bed linens are old, worn and kind of cheap. They do NOT match the stock photos from the hotel website. - the pool side rooms get POUNDED with music during the day and are unbearable if you're trying to take a nap or just relax in the afternoon. We had to switch to a strip view room after the first day to escape this. - the casino is fine, but kind of sterile and has nothing of interest. It's not a happening spot, at all. - free internet, but no Wi Fi which is crazy in 2011! Stop by here to check out: - The Pub has an enormously satisfying beer collection on tap. I can't rave enough about that. If you're a beer lover, definitely have a meal or two there and enjoy the amazing assortment of brews. - the tram station giving you access to the CityCenter & Bellagio is convenient if you're staying on the south end of the strip. -the food at the Brand steakhouse was spot on. It's a bit cheaper than some more well known establishments (Craftsteak), but the quality of meat and preparation of the 40 oz porterhouse we shared was fantastic. Don't expect some amazing twists and turns in the menu, it's typical a la carte steakhouse fare, but it is of excellent quality. I would go back in a heart beat. Just don't let them seat you at the tables that are really close to the casino floor as you'll like you're in a food court. We had to move to be comfortable. Overall, I was disappointed to stay here and was offended by the room quality. But they were clean enough so I wasn't so skeeved that I felt the need to go elsewhere. If you can avoid this place - do so.

The trip didn't start out to well, as we had to switch planes. We made it out to the holding area, when a light appeared(hydraulics). So we had to turn around and disembarked, then waited for a new plane to be taxied over. The airline (WestJet) handled things really well. The end resulted was just over a 2 hr delay(scheduled to leave TO @ 8:50). So by time we arrived at reception there was no one else checking in. Check in went smooth, given a room on the 27th floor with a southwest view (the back of NYNY & side of Excalibur. The window did open, maybe 2 inches. They state up front that there is a $15.00 service charge, and you are required to initial on the reservation . I asked if a late check out was available, and what the cost would be. They checked and said I could get the late checkout. So I was able to get the room until 3pm for $20.00, normal checkout is 11am. The room was very clean. We had 2 queen size beds which were very comfortable. Each bed had 3 pillows each. There was also a 32\" flat screen TV. In the closet was the safe(easy to operate), iron & ironing board, the hair dryer was also in there in a bag. Plus it also had 2 folding luggage benches. The bathroom was very clean, with plenty of towels. Previous reviews stated they had a burnt smell to them. We found that was the case on some of the towels but not all of them. We put it down to the cleaning chemicals and the dryer. If this will ruin your vacation, I suggest you head elsewhere. We never found the walls to be thin, we were down near the end of the hall and never heard much from the hallways. The only problem we had was that 2 nights in a row we came back to the room with the alarm clock going of next door. Called down both nights, were transferred to security, and stated the problem. It was taken care of within 5 min. each night. The pool area was very nice, it was never too crowded while we were there. There was plenty of sun all day over by the wave pool and the lazy river. The main pool near the hot tub didn't start to get any sun until 3pm. They do check your bag going in, more of a glance then anything else. You also need to show your room key. You can pick up towels down there as well. Many were using more than one, but then again it wasn't to crowded. They do frown on you when you try to move the loungers in a different direction. Inner tubes can be rented for $10.00 a day. We passed ours on to some kids when we left for the day, which made both the parents & kids happy. (Never made it in the wave pool but the lazy river is heated.) We ate at the Pub twice, the food was good. The Flatbreads (pizza) are very good. If a game(hockey for us) is on the tube they will have Happy Hour. 2 for 1 beers, plus wings & sliders. We also tried the buffet, which wasn't bad. There is a food court, which we used for quick stops in the mornings. We enjoyed the casino, never seemed to smell any smoke unless beside a smoker. Cocktail waitresses were always around. Tip them and they will be back. Location is great. Drug store right next door, ABC store across the street . Also another drug store(Walgreen's), Denny's, Outback, Hard Rock, etc.... With the late check out we had no wait at reception when checking out. Took our bags to the bell hop desk and they held them for a couple of more hours for us. We found all the staff to be very nice. Take the time to say hi to them and they will say the same to you, plus it comes with a smile. They have a Dollar car rental at the Bell Hop desk. We rented a car for 1 day. If you walk up to the desk it will cost you at least $30.00 more for the same car than if you reserved it on line. We reserved next day with a lap top from the room. You need a land line, no wireless. Also if you need to to pre book your seats for the plane, there are 3 computers on the far left hand side of reception. Just follow directions and you won't have any problems. It will show prices for printing, but it is FREE!!

(Server on night of 4/10/11 Rm 11-311) The pool area is great. There is a hot tub, lazy river, wave pool, beach volleyball court, and of course a regular pool Most importantly...the location, The Monte Carlo is in the perfect location. Next door to The New York, New York Hotel, across the street from MGM, and the hotel also has a Tram to connect to the Bellagio.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Macquarie, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDirty and smelly rooms.\u201d", "Author": "ncep17", "ReviewID": "UR103954404", "Content": "4 off us stayed at the Monte Carlo from April 3 for a week.

An awful lot. I had a conference in Las Vegas at the Monte Carlo, and my hotel room was comped by the conference. I debated paying to stay somewhere else. I'm not sure where even to begin. My main concerns in no particular order: 1. The hotel does not have wireless internet. I get that you want people on the Casino floor, and I most certainly do not want to do work while in Las Vegas, but I have clients and a team back at the office who count on me to at least check in. There is no wireless Internet at the Monte Carlo. Actually, there is. In the conference rooms. You need a password to get onto that Internet network, which the Monte Carlo will not give out to anyone. Even if you offer to pay for it. The hotel does have Internet cables but, news flash, computers made in the past two years no longer have ethernet ports. The person at the business center actually told me, \"wireless networks are very expenses, that's why most hotels don't have them.\" Um, of the 100 or so hotels I have stayed at in the past six months, ALL of them, save the Monte Carlo have wireless. And, again, ethernet cables don't work on newer computers. It's one thing to not have updated your hotel at all in the past ten years. It is quite another to make material misrepresentations to guests about the state of affairs in the rest of the world. 2. This hotel is short staffed. Which they like to point out to you at all times. Of the six light bulbs in my room, three were burnt out when I checked in. Another two burnt out during my first night, leaving me with one light in the bathroom. When I called down to the desk - at noon - I was on hold for thirty minutes. Thirty minutes. Thirty minutes. Because they were short-staffed. When I went to check in, it took me twenty minutes to get to an attendant (and there were two other people waiting in line, total). Because they were short staffed. When I ordered breakfast to my room, the wait time for delivery was an hour. An hour. Because they were short-staffed. 3. My conference comped my room. Easy enough detail, right? They had pre-paid for it. That little detail required no less than three people to check me in. And guess what? When I went to check out, it took no less than four people and thirty-minutes to complete the transaction. Because nobody could figure out how to use their computer system. 4. The wall-paper in the bathroom was peeling and the ceiling was crusting away, such that every time you closed the bathroom door a fine dust rained down. 5. There was no mini-bar in the rooms - not even an $8 bottle of water that hotels in all price classes seem to love - and the rooms had tube TVs from the mid-1990s. 6. There are a lot of off color Yankees hats (like, you know, bright green Yankees hats), professional wrestling T-shirts, children on leashes and yard glasses filled with frozen margaritas milling about on the Casino floor. Not to come off as elitist, but the hotel has all the feel and character of a Greyhound station. I get that the Monte Carlo is not the Cosmopolitan.

Does not have that ash tray odor when you enter the building like many do. A nice food court with variety, and a great pool area with lazy river. They actually would have gotten five stars if this was the entire story of our experience. The bad.... Online they offer \"Strip Views\" for an additional fee per night. We were booking two rooms for us and our friends, and were supposed to be next to each other. When we arrived they said they could not put us together, but offered to at least get us on the same floor. Ok... no big deal. So we get to our room it has a great strip view across Las Vegas boulvevard to the MGM and other casinos. At night you see all the lights on the strip... and that was great.. But our friends, who were also supposed to get a strip view were put in a room facing Interstate 15, and looking at the back of the new developments to the north, and the Aria hotel. Add in the air conditioners and it is a pretty boring view. Not facing the strip what so ever. Ok so is that all that bad? Well it depends on how the front desk staff respond when this concern was brought to their attention. Instead of admitting that yes this in not the \"strip view\" you upgraded to, they claimed that the Aria is considered a strip view because it's address is on Las Vegas Blvd. Anyone who has seen the Aria knows that it is way off of Las Vegas Blvd behind a huge mall, and most of the other Strip properties. Ok.. So when we got a supervisor involved... they still did not want to budge from calling this a Strip View room. But we negotiated down the \"resort fees\" of $15 per day for both of our rooms, to compensate our friends for the extra amount they were paying $30 per day for the alleged strip view room. Manager Celeste agreed to it, and said she put it on our account. Of course by the next morning when she was off shift and we were checking out, a different front desk employee had a different story. He said only one of the rooms had been waived for the resort fee. Another debate with the front desk personnel and the supervisor ensued. Although this time, no one was arguing that it was a strip view anymore. It was like they assumed we were lying, and the supervisor simply said I am going to waive the fee on the second room also, just because their is a line forming behind you. We are still waiting for the credit card charge to see what they really did.. but for now we are assuming they did. Bottom line... If you get the strip view then great... you should have no problems. If you have paid for the strip view and get to look at the plain silver Aria hotel..Good luck", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cApril 5th thru 8th 2011\u201d", "Author": "mtnbiker4300", "ReviewID": "UR103403271", "Content": "I've found a new home on the strip thanks to a great Host and Manager, Jacob Ellis.

We belong to the Mlife program through MGM promotions and wanted to use out comps and discounts to stay this time. We have stayed at Mirage and Mandalay Bay in this group. By far both others are nicer. To start, I chose Monte Carlo for the location and the fact that the reservation rep told me that they had an arcade. We were looking at New York New York because I knew they had a good kid arcade but they didn't have an attractive pool area. The Monte Carlo pool area is ok. Nothing like Mandalay Bay, but it has a lazy river and a small wave pool. (Lazy River was closed for the first hour we were out there 11:00ish). There is NO arcade at Monte Carlo. I tend to choose hotels by size of room and bathroom. The bathroom was nothing to write home about...room not so hot either. There were stains on the carpet, walls, drapes, SHEETS and the shower curtain. The towels in the bathroom smelt like they were burnt...not nice when drying off your face! The hall carpet was stained also in many areas. We were anticipating the hotel fee so that wasn't an issue, but the internet cable was missing in one room and we had to search for it in our other room. We did call for help and we found the 1 cable about 45 minutes before the attendant came.

At that time it was a lovely stay. I couldn't believe that not a thing has been refurbished in their guest rooms, except maybe the TV sets, since 1998. As far as guest service, the only friendly service we received was from the parking valets. The front desk clerk was a snooty guy named Thomas, who acted like he was doing us a favor, giving us and I quote \"a beautiful room on a higher floor (19th so not really) with a Strip view because we were booked for 5 nights.. Well, the view of the Strip was minimal, it was more like a view of the Monte Carlo's casino roof top. The bathroom floor looked filthy, as if someone had grease on their shoes and housekeeping couldn't clean it. The wallpaper was coming off the wall in the bathroom and the wallpaper that was on the wall also has greasy fingerprints on it. The shower pressure was horrible and I like a stronger water flow, but this was like nothing I've ever seen before. I couldn't connect with the internet because there was nothing to connect to. I called the front desk and naturally get snooty Thomas who acted like I was stupid and didn't know how to connect. An engineer was sent to our room and he said \"unforunately when the internet connection jack breaks, they have nothing to replace it with\", so he went to another room to get one. Talk about stealing from Peter to pay Paul. Bedding was uncomfortable because it seemed like the mattress was worn out, again like I said befoe, it probably wasn't changed since I was there in 1998. I was so disgusted I checked out the next morning. I called to make sure I wouldn't be charged any penalties for leaving early and was assured that I wouldn't. I called The Rio and got a good deal with them (and a nicer room with a friendlier staff). Price-wise the Monte Carlo was cheap, and that is exactly what you get ---- cheap.

After days of painstakingly combing many different travel sites, including the websites of each of the individual resorts that are located on the strip, I came across the Monte Carlo. I discovered they they offered prices that were especially reasonable in comparison to the others. I signed up to their mailing list and noticed that by doing so I was given a further 20% off their already discounted room rates. Our stay was over 4 nights from March 31st-April 4th, which fell during the tail end of spring break. I was able to secure rates through the Monte Carlo website at $44.85, $108.85, $120.05, and $44.85. (Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) for each of the two rooms. We arrived at the hotel precisely at 3PM, which is check-in time, and entered the hotel to a rather chaotic lobby scene- which to be fair is par for the course for any Vegas resort at check in time. The lobby was elegantly appointed and there was a very pungent smell of women's purfume which seemed to be constantly pumped into the concourse. I enjoyed, though others may feel it rather overwhelming. After a very brief wait (ten minutes, maximum) we made it to the front desk itself. The woman at the reception was nice and personable. She assigned us rooms which matched our requests (near each other, high floor, non smoking, etc). We entered the room and discovered them to be adequately spacious but rather drab and colorless. The walls are painted with a plain vanilla color with little to nothing adorning them. The TV was large and HI def capable, however none of the channels were actually offered in HI-definition, meaning that all of the channels appeared horizontally distorted and took some getting used to. The desk and chair were very simple and rather antiquated, though again, adequate. The nightstand matched the desk in both appearance and age, though it did come equipped with an ipod clock/docking station, which was a nice touch. By contrast, however, it must be noted that the beds were FANTASTIC. They were exceptionally comfortable in every way, from the pillows to the sheets to the blankets. Sometimes hotels guests are forced to call in for more blankets due to inadequate bedding, but in our room even with the thermostat set at a constant 60 degrees throughout our stay, we never had to ask for more accoutrements. The blackout curtains were 100% effective in blocking out the brilliant desert sun even when it was 90+ outside and the sun shining directly into our bedroom window (We got a parking lot + New York New York Resort view on the 15th level). The bathroom was sufficiently large and well stocked with everything we could need, whether it be lotion or conditioner, plenty of towels, or even an extra roll of toilet paper should we ever need it. The water pressure was not lacking and the water temperature always quick to warm/cool as desired. The internet was adequately speedy, though the fact that there was no wireless internet capability meant you had to connect via hard wire, which was rather disappointing as I desperately wanted to utilize my comfy bed! We found the different pools and lazy river to be exceptionally fun and lively, though we were very disappointed that it all closed by 5PM! The sun was still up two hours after pool closure and the temperature had reached the 90s on Friday and Saturday . What's the point of even having a pool if it's not going to be offered in such ideal conditions? We felt that the casino was very generously spacious with many different fun options in terms of gaming. The dealers all seemed friendly as were the cocktail waitresses. We picked out three specific keno machines and gravitated towards them every time we went down to the casino floor. We got to know our local cocktail waitress Gemma who was exceptionally personable and really, REALLY made us feel at home. She really went out of her way to ALWAYS make sure we had drinks in our hands at all times, and not just the small freebie ones either. I drank exclusively pina coladas, and my drinks were always brought with cherry garnishes and copious amounts of whipped cream, just the way I like them. For reference, we sat very near the cafe and Brand Steakhouse, which were also near the fancy shmancy \"rapid roulette\" tables. It's often times the small things like this that leave lasting impressions, and in that regard Gemma definitely stood out. As a poker aficionado, I made it a priority to visit the poker room and play there a couple of times. On the whole I was VERY disappointed with the poker room and the EXTRAORDINARILY unfriendly service given to us by the hostesses at the front and the dealers as well. My friends and I had been interested in playing in some of the tournaments and when I phoned ahead to inquire as to how many folks had signed up, I was told not to worry about how many people had signed up and just come down and sign up. I insisted on knowing how many had signed up since the tournaments are 60 dollars to enter, and I was very audibly sighed at by the receptionist and told \"Let me go find out\" in a very overtly rude way. The poker tables themselves had an odd flat depression towards the armrests on the sides, so it felt like you were playing poker on a hill rather than a table. You couldn't \"slide\" your chips towards the betting circle as you might do on any other poker playing surface, here you had to lift up your whole stack and hope you didn't hit your stack on the lip of the felt and thus drop your stack. You'd also be admonished if you placed your chips on the actual 'hill' because your chips would be too near the betting circle and would thus be in an unsuitably precarious position. I'll decline to name the individuals I encountered, but several of the poker dealers who cycled into my particular game were humorless, dry, and extremely short with us. We were a lively table and we were very much enjoying ourselves, but one dealer in particular had an especially dour demeanor and passive aggressively let us know whenever he could that we were a major inconvenience to him. I've played poker in many different venues across the world and while I found the poker room itself to be rather comfortable and fun, the only thing I'll remember it for is the poor service and strangely designed poker tables. We wanted to try happy hour at The Pub and were disappointed at the limited choices offered for beer and appetizers. We were also not sure how one dollar for ONE wing qualifies as 'happy hour'... but that being said we were impressed with the quality and freshness of the wings and sliders that were offered. The sliders in particular were very tasty and we ordered probably 15-20 of them between the 3 of us. I hadn't been in the drinking mood so I ordered a root beer. While it cost a ridiculous 4 dollars, it was unlike any other root beer I had had before. It seemed to have been pulled from a keg and possibly fresh brewed. It had a nice, stout head on it as if it were genuine beer. I didn't inquire as to the specifics, but it was a very tasty and fresh root beer. My friend happened to order a chicken caesar salar and was aghast that during happy hour it was still a whopping 19 DOLLARS. Probably the most expensive caesar salad I have ever come across. Of course, this was the name of the game at every restaurant in the Monte Carlo, including at the food court. At any typical Subway location around the USA, for instance, you'll find that there is a selection of five dollar subs. Those same subs at the Monte Carlo will cost you upwards of 7 dollars for a 40%+ markup. McDonalds was a similarly awful choice in that regard, in that you'd find a standard big mac meal for over 7 dollars at this food court, way above what you'd normally find at a typical mcDonalds restaurant away from the strip. We dined at the Cafe on one occasion and found the food there to be good but the service a bit sparse and slow for a Sunday at 2pm. While prices were similarly high I found the food quality to be good. We ordered chicken tenders as an appetizer and they were very fresh and large, and my hamburger was tasty. I couldn't eat the whole thing. It must be said that my friend, who ordered the shrimp scampi, said that his sauce was VERY creamy, much more so than you would expect from a typical scampi. I agree, although I did enjoy the actual taste of it. One final annoyance that we encountered during our stay was the um, let's say punctuality of the housekeeping staff. I have no idea why, but almost immediately after checking in we got a typical \"coin bang\" on our front door with someone screaming 'housekeeping', We were surprised when even though she was hardly through with the first knock she immediately entered the room before I could even get up off the bed! She saw us and left. I went to the door and asked her if something was wrong, and she said she said in rather broken English 'room check'. I had no idea what that meant but just assumed it was a misunderstanding... The next morning at about 8:30- 9:00AM we got another coin bang on the front door with another woman shrieking \"housekeeping. \" She also scarcely waited more than a split second after knocking once before entering the room. Again, the woman saw us and said 'I come back later'. Having already been awakened, I went out and asked if they could just come back later at 2PM, and she said just put out the \"Do not disturb sign\". In fairness this is exactly what I should have done from the start (and it's exactly what I did every morning thereafter) but It was still an inconvenience to be woken up so early like that... In summary: Pros: Very comfy beds, affordable room rates, pool quality, quality and speed of cocktail service (especially Gemma), size of casino, large choice of games, kind dealers. Cons: Rude poker room attendants, high price of food and entertainment on site, pool hours, housekeeping 'punctuality', \"Happy Hour\" at the pub, lack of Hi Def channel selections to match HI Def TVs. Overall we were very pleased with the value we received for what we paid. We understand that 'your mileage will vary' with respect to the shortcomings in service and the other disappointments we encountered. None of the problems that we ran into seemed to be systemic administrative flaws, just individual lapses here and there.

When we came back, there was still hair on the bathroom floor and the carpet was better but still had lint in places. So if room cleanliness is an issue for you, you will not enjoy this hotel. The bed was very comfortful and we never had any trouble sleeping. The hotel amenities were very good. There are two Starbucks located on the resort. We mostly ate all of our meals at other venues on the strip. Cabo Wabo (Planet Hollywood) has a nice patio and delicious mexican food. Dinner at Pampas (Miracle Mile Mall, Planet Hollywood) was fantastic! I totally recommend going there. The Premium Outlet (North) is an outdoor mall that has many fantastic stores to shop at. I definately recommend getting the shopping passport; we saved a lot of money using it. We walked from the Monte Carlo to the New York, New York hotel and took the bus (WAX NB/WB) on Tropicana. It is only an 8 to 10 minute ride. Very convenient. Overall, I would visit this resort/casino again but would not stay here. I believe this resort is shown as a 4 or 4.5 star hotel (we normally stay in 4.5 to 5 star hotels). I would say it is more like 3 or 3.5.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sterling", "Title": "\u201cFind somewhere else to stay\u201d", "Author": "Hammer5457", "ReviewID": "UR102693288", "Content": "Sure wish we would have.

The hotel was clean, but for the four days we were there, we had warm (not hot) water in the room only once regardless of what time of day we showered. They had an ice machine, but no ice buckets. The cleaning staff seemed to make a point of ramming their vacuum into the door to wake us up and get us out of room in the morning because they did it around 9-10am repeatedly every day of our stay. Finally, we found it a little unsettling that while our valuables were locked up in the in room safe, a small amount of change disappeared from the dresser in our room...makes one question what items need to be locked in the safe when leaving the room if 16 cents is not even safe!", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redlands, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay, With Serious Exceptions...\u201d", "Author": "Sophiemichaels", "ReviewID": "UR102190480", "Content": "This place has so much potential, that if they'd quit trying to nickel and dime you in stupid ways, they'd deserve more stars. First of all, the resort fee is just silly. It's 15 dollars. Allegedly, this covers the 50 cent daily newspaper, fitness center (used by MAYBE 10 percent of guests), free copying and faxing (really? In Vegas? How many people use that?) Free boarding pass printing (whoah - pinch me...) and free local and toll free calls (for the two people left on the planet with no cell phone). I thought the room was decently priced for it's quality and location on the strip. The room is definitely no frills - no fridge, microwave, coffeemaker. It has a nifty ipod alarm clock - that was cool. The beds are comfortable and the pillows are puffy and plentiful. The room is big too. I had a crappy view of traffic and parking lot, but wasn't expecting much better as I didn't pay for strip view. Weird experience with room service: Went to order it, and had no menu. called down for a menu. Half an hour later, still no menu and two people come to my door to perform a \"security check.\" No idea what that is, and they didn't explain - but they looked, saw that I'm a middle-aged chick travelling with a 4 and 6 year old, so wasn't much of a threat. So I call down again and say - thanks for the security check, now can I have a menu? Once I finally ordered, the room service took an hour and fifteen minutes to get to me! One thing about the hotel windows - they're old, and they aren't very thick and don't seem all that secure. Someone else here complained that the window opens only two inches... Well, I'm on the tenth floor of a high-rise - I don't WANT to \"air out\" the room by opening a window. Frankly, you don't want windows that open in a building where someone may have just lost their life savings gambling. Also with little kids, I wished I had more faith in the security bar that keeps that window from opening. So, back to the nickel and diming: They have a food court with mcdonalds, some Italian place, starbucks, subway and an Asian place... nice selection. So we get subway sandwiches and a bottle of water and make our way out to the pool. They search our bags and tell us we can't take \"outside\" food into the pool area. They employ a staff member who's only job is to go through your stuff and make sure you don't bring food or drink in . I said \"Outside food? I bought this fifty feet from here INSIDE your hotel!\" It's just such a thinly veiled way to force you to buy their pool food and drink, and you gotta love the sign that says it's for the guests \"safety.\" I don't mind buying their expensive drinks and nachos (in fact I did later!) It's just such an insult to common sense and the guests' intelligence to frisk us for food for our safety. OK, on to more favorable stuff. The staff I encountered were ALL very nice, friendly and professional. The valet guys especially - enthusiastic and fast in their work. There is the cutest little cupcake shop on the property, as well as a music memorabilia store and fun clothing store with cute if overpriced women's stuff. The lobby's big and smells of roses. They have a HUGE restaurant called The Pub with nice beer choices, and you HAVE to try their sliders if you're into that... they are some of the best little burgers I've ever had. Lots of flatscreens and an overall yummy menu and different cool seating arrangements. Best reason to stay here with kids: The pool area. My kids absolutely loved it, and so did I. I would come back to this hotel just for the good time we had there. It's this cool oasis surrounded by highrises. The wave pool is fun and bright and clean, and the lazy river is big enough to be a blast for the kids, but small enough that you can see 'em as they go all the way around. Average hot tub, nice pool, but a little on the small side (the pool area wasn't crowded though, so it didn't matter much). The servers in the pool area were fast and freindly, and there always seemed to be someone there if you wanted something (again, they really push the food and drink there!) The drinks we had were delicious. My daughter cut her foot, and there was a first-aid guy there one minute after she started crying. Lots of lifeguards (maybe to enforce stupid rules like \"You can't sit on the side of the wave pool.\" Probably for my own safety - that five inches of water in the shallow end could cause problems...) Anyway - the pool area really is awesome. Here are the things to look out for: At least this time of year, The hotel blocks the sun from most of the pool area for a good chunk of the afternoon. And the pools close at FIVE O'CLOCK! I guess the sun sets early and they don't have lights out there, which I think is also a trademark of Vegas - I was told they all close early. Bet it's so you'll get your butt out of the pool and go gamble. Also, the music was LOUD. Almost UNCOMFORTABLE LOUD. You get used to it after awhile, and the music was a fun party selection, but even slightly quiter would have made a big difference. NOTE: If you're travelling with a bunch of people and want to really treat yourself, there's a great VIP cabana aarea vailable for rent... it's 500 dollars, and your drinks (and maybe food) count toward that cost. It's fenced in and has it's own little pool, flat screens, really nice lounging areas and cabana cover. It's just awesome for a bachelor party or something. And trust me - you and a handful of people don't have to be professionals to drink 500 bucks worth in about three hours at this place!:) So there you go - despite the weird irritations, I'd stay here again. But what I'd probably do first is look for a comparable pool situation. My other reviews prove me to be a pretty laid-back traveller, but these guys pushed the irritation level a little too high for me to automatically give them repeat business.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cDelightful Stay with friendly staff and a great location!\u201d", "Author": "FamilyTraveller13", "ReviewID": "UR101959967", "Content": "The Monte Carlo is well positioned on the strip.

At least you can sit on the bed and not worry. A part from the stained carpet the room was very clean. It was nice to have a couch, and a bar with a fridge in the room and the spaciousness of it was really nice.

Calling through my mLife promotions for the best rate, I landed at the Monte Carlo and got a great room for $39/night. (Plus their $15 resort fee, but I'd been paying that much for internet each day at the Flamingo.. soooo.. it kind of evened out.) Check-in was a breeze, although I could see it being a totally different experience if it were crowded. There were no formal lines or queue. You just sort of found your way to a desk agent and were helped. Mine was extra friendly and fast (what is it about Vegas hotels and airport gate agents that require 15 minutes of typing to process anything?!) I was given a room on the 19th floor on the east spoke (MC is in the traditional 3-spoke ground plan that Mirage and TI are also in.) I had an awesome view of the mountains and the backsides of NYNY, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Now, it may have been in comparison to the torture device that I'd spent the last two nights in, but the bed here was so much nicer! Nicer linens and a big comforter! Room was spot on in size (though, no huge.) I imagine if it had been a 2 queen room it might have felt cramped. The bathroom was spacious and didn't feel like I was crammed into it. My only complaint was the shower. Several other people have noted this and I have to agree --- the water pressure on the shower feels like you're getting sandblasted! OUCH! I enjoy the Monte Carlo's gaming floor and have always done well. Their choice of dining options is enough to satisfy most appetites, but if you can't find what you're looking for here, the MC is connected via free tram to Aria/CityCenter/Bellagio/Cosmo, and NYNY is a 3 minute walk.

I originally wanted to stay at the Planet Hollywood or NYNY but the Monte Carlo was the cheapest so I booked it. I read all the reviews online and heard about \"the blood on the sheets\", \"thin walls\", it being outdated, etc. Don't believe the reviews! I loved the hotel, it's super nice inside, it had a new television, a big bathroom, and I didn't see any blood on the sheets. The beds were super comfy to sleep on and it also had an ipod dock if you wanted to play some tunes. The only thing I would complain about would be that one morning the alarm in the room beside us which was vacant was going off. I called security and told them and literally five minutes later they were there fixing the problem. As for location, it is right beside the NYNY, across from the Coke, M&Ms store, and MGM Grand. There is also a convenient tram that takes you from the Monte Carlo to CityCentre and then on to the Bellagio (we took that quite often). We didn't use the pool as it was chilly for Vegas standards (I'm from Canada so i thought it was hot), but it looked really nice. The one thing that was annoying was the the entrance to the hotel is at the side, but if you want to get to the strip quick there is an entrance in front. The staff were okay. When I checked in I thought I would try the \"$20 trick\" which she quickly shot down saying that they don't accept tips, however, she did offer me a strip room which i believe is more money. Also, we booked a king size online but we got two queens instead, she said something along the lines of \"just because you book it online doesn't mean you are going to get it..\" it wasn't a big deal in the end though. Also, one morning we wanted to go to the nearest IHOP, the concierge printed us off directions, which we followed but we knew something was up when we weren't seeing the sign or anything. It was then I noticed that on the paper she printed it said \"Closed 2008\", so that was annoying and a waste of time. Other things I didn't like was the lack of wifi in the hotel, internet was included in the resort fee, however, it was plug in internet and I brought my iPad so I couldn't use it.

Made it to the hotel and stood in a long line to check in. (which is normal, and I understand) Was told by the desk clerk that our Spa Suite was not quite ready, as most of the Spa Suites were full last night. (It was the Tuesday after Valentine\u2019s day) It was probably 2:30 \u2013 3:00 local time. Don\u2019t they make you leave the room by 11 AM?? (I was thinking...) Oh well, it\u2019s a pleasure trip....I can stand to go \u201cChill out\u201d in the Pub and have a couple of beers. I was given a set of keys, but no room number assigned, and was told to check back in about 45 minutes. We went and had a couple of beers in the bar. (Which was really nice but kind of expensive....but...again...had to remind myself: ON vacation.) Called the number they gave me...was told: 45 minutes...I slightly protested saying I was told that about an hour ago, they responded with: \u201cThe room is not guaranteed until 5 PM\u201d .....I really need to get my stuff in the room, as we are supposed to be meeting the rest of my party and going out in a little bit and it would REALLY be nice if I was situated in the room, with access to my stuff and it NOT stuck in some Bellman\u2019s warehouse. But, ok....met the rest of our party whose fight had come in from Denver. They had their room already. Went back and forth with this about 3 times...was given the same \u201c45 minutes / 5 PM guarantee thingy\u201d song and dance number. Again.....I realize it\u2019s a HUGE hotel, and this IS Vegas...but it\u2019s kind of hard for me to realize it taking 6 hours to clean a room. Ok...after we finally got in the room....VERY nice! Comfortable looking room, inviting bed, wonderful looking Spa tub. VERY pleased for the price we paid. The room had the steam shower option which was VERY nice for my girlfriend\u2019s cold / sinus condition. Believe it or not....the shower head also ACTUALLY had some water pressure. I was amazed! It had a little \u201cwet bar\u201d with a small refrigerator which was also nice. As for the casino. We are not smokers, I don\u2019t like it, but my girlfriend has a VERY LOW tolerance for cigarette smoke and it is one of her \u201ctriggers\u201d for migraine headaches. Just walking thru the casino it had a pretty heavy smell of cigarettes. I personally think that they could have ventilated the casino a little bit better. I know that it will never be smoke free, but a little more ventilated would be a LOT better. We ate at the breakfast at The cafe because it was handy. I must admit, it kind of bothers me paying $14 + for breakfast, but again....I\u2019m on vacation....happy thoughts. However...it was pretty good! We had a few issues with the climate control system, but the maintenance man showed up and very courteously explained the situation and we were mostly good the rest of the trip. The Bell staff was very good and courteous.. This place is considered a \u201cmid-range\u201d hotel.. We stayed here because of the Spa Suite. We have stayed at the Luxor\u2019s Spa Suite, (and liked it) but this place is even better. It has a nice location on the strip. There is both a CVS and a Walgreens nearby. There were some \u201cannoying\u201d things, but more than likely we will stay here again. We can\u2019t wait to go back!

We came with her extended family to celebrate her uncle's 40th Birthday. There were 8 of us who booked our rooms here. None of us have stayed here, but all of us have been to Vegas before, us being the most experienced, this would make our 6th trip in 2 years. I made the recommendation to stay here based on the location and it's 4 star AAA rating, and the rate's were very attractive as well. We booked in November, and were able to save over $150 compared to the standard rates, a suggestion I would have to others, if you can, book 2-3 months in advance and get a good rate locked on, and if possible book directly with the Hotel, I found this get's you the best deals. We arrived early at 9am and tried to check in, found out that our room would not be ready till 3pm or maybe later. We were OK with that, but we had a bigger issue at hand. Of the 4 rooms we booked, one reservation could not be found. They had rooms available, but of course would be at a much higher rate, loosing the $150 savings. I had a contact from an email I had sent to the hotel, and I gave her a call. She was there, and was very friendly and polite. She told me to wait and she would get someone to give me a call back. 15 minutes later the Supervisor of the front desk called my cell. I told her what had happened. She took my information, promptly took care of the issue. The missing reservation was corrected, and they honored the price we had been quoted earlier. We also got our rooms cleaned and ready early, 12:30 pm, without even asking for it. WOW, now that's GREAT service! Everywhere we went on the property, from the Valet, to the Bell Service, to the Front Desk, the Housekeeping staff, casino personal, were all very friendly, and greeted us whenever possible with a very pleasant smile and words of welcome. I was very happy to hear the Valet staff especially say every time we returned, Welcome back! Simple but heartwarming. Our room was a strip view on the 21st floor, as everyone's in our party, another surprise that was arranged by the front desk without even requesting. Very convenient when we had to meet up to go out to eat dinner or go out on the town. Rooms were very spacious and VERY CLEAN, beds were comfy, lots of pillows (4) and lots of drawers and closet space and hangers. The bathroom had plenty of marble, big mirror, a low entry tub/ shower combo, and this AWESOME shower head that really refreshed you when taking that shower. I need to find out where they got it, I'll have to get one for myself! I could go on and on about how much we like Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino, but I'll stop here. I would stay here again, and recommend others visit this very wonderful Hotel Resort. Oh .. wait, I almost forgot to mention the great staff at the Spa and Fitness center, I only went 1 day, but the service and facility was top notch, walk in and you get to use the shower, sauna, and even arrange for a massage, (for a nominal fee) all this without leaving the fitness Center. Very nice touch. On behalf of me, my wife and my extended family, we'd like to thank the Management and Staff of the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino Las Vegas.

There's just too many options out there. And a run down hotel is not how you stay competitive in a hospitality market such as Vegas. Let's start with the overall stinch when you walk in the place. It literally smells like your grandmother's house. You know the one that she's had since the 60's. The lobby was eh, not impressive, but the worst part is when you get to the rooms. They don't have wifi at all! That's a big no no for a business traveler. More importantly the wired internet service that's included in this miscellaneous resort fee (which I argue that this is no where close to a resort) didn't even work! Then there's a huge bulky TV. Who on earth still has this an option. NO HD Tvs in Vegas, you've got to be kidding me?!?! Everything about the rooms made my skin crawl. Antiquated tiling and bathroom amenities.

The hotel staff were very helpful in letting us switch to a strip view room at no extra cost and the concierge were extremely helpful. In terms of location I can't think of a better place to be. A free shuttle service that runs approx every 3 mins straight to the Bellagio means you are at the centre of the strip within minutes. In addition, the bus stop outside which allows you to go up and down the strip for $7 a day means you can see everything there is to see in Vegas. The 'Street of dreams' in the hotel isn't really dreamy - a pub, Harley Davidson shop and some others but with Caesers and the Planet Hollywood mile of shops just down the road there's plenty of choice elsewhere.

It is set back a bit and has some sort of roman theme. When we entered the main reception it looked quite nice but it is not on the same scale as the aria next door or the mgm grand. The couple who we had arrived with had requested a room on the smoking floor and my partner had asked for a room near them on the 25th floor. When we arrived on the floor you could smell smoke (obviously) I do not smoke so was already a bit miffed that my partner had requested we be on this floor. We had been booked into a deluxe strip view room which is the standard room but on a higher floor with a view over the strip, the rooms come with either a king size bed or two queens. When we entered the room we had been given two queens (which we had not been asked which we would prefer) The view out of the window was amazing but the windows looked a bit dirty. The rooms are pretty dated with brown patterned carpet and an old style tv inside a big cabinet a desk lamp and chair. The bathrooms are fine with a decent shower inside a bath and a large counter with sink and mirror. There are no tea making facilities and no mini bar in the room which is a bit dissapointing. I was not happy because the room smelled of smoke and I wanted a king size bed I decided I wanted another room on a non smoking floor (Im not usually one of those complainers but on this occasion after an 11 hour flight from the uk I wanted something a bit better) So back we went to reception and I explained the situation and apologised for being such a pain. The lady was very nice and gave us a room with a king size bed on the non smoking 28th floor. We had to wait for it to be ready but that was fine. We went and wondered down 'The street of dreams' where the shops are the Harley Davidson shop is cool. So on our way to the room we noticed the hallways do have a strong smell of flowery carpet freshener (as mentioned in other reviews) its not that bad once you get used to it but it is a bit sickly. Our room was much the same but with a king size bed and a bit brighter. The view over the strip is really cool and I think having that made the room seem a lot better. The casino is smaller than some other hotels but its not bad the food court is good and has mcdonalds subway chinease and mexican. The resteraunts are located off the casino floor. The first night we had dinner in Brands and I have to say it was absoloutley delicious the tomato soup was divine and the steak perfect. The beds are absoloutly the most comfortable beds ever which is a big thing when you are staying for a while (we were staying 11 days) the walls are a bit thin but I always take ear plugs so coupled with the comfy bed sleep was no problem and well enjoyed. I ordered room service on a couple of occasions and the food was always nice we either went down to Mcdonalds for breakfast or into 'The Cafe' they do really nice eggs benedict in their but it does get busy. We didn't bother going to see Jabba Wokeez or Frank Caliendo because they looked a bit rubbish and by the end of the holiday I was sick of seeing them cos they were adverstised on the small screens in the lift constantly. When you go around the other hotels you realise why the Monte Carlo is quite a bit cheaper it is just not as fancy and has not been updated. I didn't use the pool as it was december and cold so cannot comment on that. The Pub was ok but it was all people watching sport so not really for me we had some nachos in their and they were really very nice and you get loads. The house keeping staff were excellent and our room was always tidied every day and was always left spotless. Basically this is a no frills hotel, it is located on the strip so thats good, the staff are nice and helpfull, the food is nice, and the prices are good, It IS dated and the rooms although clean are looking a bit worn and tired.

Was impressed with relatively large room size. Bathroom isn't very big but perfectly fine for a standard type room. Room was quiet at night and bed seemed comfortable enough. Our group was mostly interested in gambling and partying and the Monte Carlo didn't disappoint. Saturday night was hopping when we finally got down to the casino. They have a party pit with several $5 and $10 6:5 blackjack tables surrounding a stage with a few girls dancing. This is only running on weekend nights. The rest of the casino has good blackjack that offers surrender for as little as $10. Drink service was fine a on par with other strip casinos. This casino is pretty easy to navigate compared to others on the strip; from the elevators it is a little bit of a walk out to the strip but nothing like MGM Grand. There is also a walkway to get to the new Aria casino without having to go out to the strip which was cool because Aria has a nice sports book for watching tv. MC's book is just ok with older chairs. Waked by the pool but didn't use it; there were plenty of people enjoying it, though. It's bad that to get to the pool you have to walk through the lobby, though. Newer hotels like the Wynn have a separate spa/pool floor from the elevators. Stopped by the brew pub one night which no longer brews their own beer. They had a band and it seemed like a good type of place to go if you get there early, but it just seemed set up weird for a late night band act. To sum it up, this a nice hotel that definitely caters to middle of the road gamblers and a middle age crowd. The rooms and entire resort are clean, moderately fancy but certainly not over the top. I would stay here again if I wanted to be on the strip for under $80/night.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "Sangria888", "ReviewID": "UR90596855", "Content": "Location is gd as there is a free team shuttle to aria hotel next door n ESP helpful to the bellagio.

The hotel was well located, as we went to 2 shows at the MGM across the street (Cirque de Soleil KA and Crazy Horse - both excellent). MC is right on the tram which takes you to the ARIA and Bellagio which offer even more shopping, shows and nightlife. We checked in immediately, got the room we asked for, and they upgraded to high-floor strip view for free. Excellent Service. The pool was too cold (November) but looked decent and private. THE SPA WAS THE BEST. Men and Women have separate spas so you can really relax - use the hot tub, steamroom, sauna, ice-facecloths and other amenities in total relaxation. There's even snacks and water on-hand included. Free hair and body products, use of their robes, towels and slippers. Yes you have to pay a $15 resort fee per day, then $5 each time you use the gym or spa, but if you don't plan to use it, you can ask for that fee to be waived. Honestly, we got the hotel for close to $50 a night, so to pay extra for the spa was not a big deal. The Spa was really worth it. Gym is decent and is co-ed. The food in this hotel was pretty good. BRAND has a great deal for happy hour - 2-for-1 which is great. The mini-burgers are the best. The buffet is ok, breakfast is best, but I wouldn't do it everyday if you can help it. Lots of food to snack on in the food court. I didn't make it to the other restaurants, but the ICE Bar looked really cool - you literally sit on Ice seats and tables. Very Norwegian. Jabberwockies is one of the current shows - looked good but we were too busy to get to that one. If you want an adventure go to the GUN STORE - a $15 cab ride where you can learn to handle all types of firearms, and shoot off some steam.

This was actually my 2nd time staying at this hotel. Now its even better because it connects to Aria (City Center) which is the most Awesome hotel on the strip right now. At The Monte Carlo, the hotel always smells fresh. I hate the penetrating smell of cigarette smoke at some hotels that have poor air/ventilation filters. The room was always very clean. Our towels were fresh and did not look dingy or worn out. For the price that we paid per night, the room was great. The casino area was great, spacious, and I like that the hotel also has a Food Court just in case you want to grab something quick to eat.

Since the Monte Carlo is in a great location, we would get on the Aria/Monte Carlo Tram to go to other hotels on the strip which cut down on the walking and we avoided paying for taxis!!!

We asked for a move the next day to a non smoking floor which had a strip view. This was dealt with efficiently and the bell desk were excellent in moving all our stuff.

Room safe was one of those thin flat ones which make it difficult to store things like laptops but only a minor issue and big enough to store passports cash etc. Overall would recommend this hotel as it is convenient for Citycenter which is right next door and there is also a monorail which takes you to Crystals and Bellagio.

I wasn't too thrilled at the prospect at staying at the Monte Carlo initially. I had stayed there for a business trip in 2008 and I was really not impressed. Rooms were a bit dirty and the casino was blah and empty. This trip, I'm not sure if my perspective changed because it was a leisure trip or if the hotel/casino made changes. The August 2010 trip was a complete 180! The rooms were cleaned up (tho same old dated decor - not my thing), the mattresses were classed up (my mom could've spent the entire vacation sleeping ... the beds are to die for!!), the bathroom is roomy .. my complaint about the room (which I've seen others complain about) is the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. The casino, this trip, was hopping every night (we were there a total of 3 nights). Cocktail drink service was great. We didn't win but we had fun. The casino didn't take our money the first night .. always a good thing. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You have City center, New York New York, Planet Hollywood, and the MGM all within a short walking distance or tram ride. You don't feel stuck at your hotel. With temps in August over 110 degrees, the convenience of having places to go to within a short distance is perfect. One recommendation is don't think you can walk to the Mirage and back without killing your feet. We did it and regretted it. One other note about the Monte Carlo is the food choices. I was traveling with a non-foodie and it was nice to have fast food within the property. McDonalds, Rubio's, Sbarro, and even 2 Starbucks (yes ... TWO!!!) This is definately something to consider if you're traveling with someone who doesn't want to experiment with the great restaurants LV has to offer. Some of the BIG hotels (Bellagio and the Wynn in particular) do not offer any fast food. Also, be sure to sign up for the MGM/Mirage club card when staying here.

The layout of the property was great. The food court area and entrance to the Street of Dreams (shopping and access to the tram to City Center and Bellagio) was very close to the elevators as was the Lobby. The casino never felt crowded and it was a quick walk through to get to the Strip. It's a short walk to City Center and the overhead walkway to Planet Hollywood. Because the Cosmopolitan is still under construction we weren't able to walk past City Center without crossing the street first. Hopping the tram to Bellagio solved that problem. The Duece southbound stops right outside the hotel and there are 2 stops for northbound within a short walk across the street.

We had to \"take what was available\" on a couple of the rooms. The rooms were OK, many have commented they need updating/remodeling and we would agree, but some are better than others? The service was good all around, not great, but really no complaints. Bell service was above average, we had a bunch of luggage and the one guy did a great job when we arrived.

Also, the wedding chapel signage has been removed from the 2nd floor completely? The room is still there, but it's not \"called\" the wedding chapel any longer??? Very silly and potentially very confusing for some. Certainly it's not important to many who visit, but the parking gargage at MC is simply one of the best on the strip.

If slot play is the primary focus of your trip, take your business off the strip, you might not hit it big, but your $$ will last longer. Tables were OK, hard to find multiple seats at BJ tables under $15 though. We tried the Cafe for breakfast and found it to be good, maybe a little above average. The buffet was OK but really just barely average for LV. Monte Carlo does have a better than average food court with good variety and comfortable seating. Also visited the new -5 Ice bar at MC, had a good time, but kind of pricey. In summary, another good visit to Monte Carlo as it continues to be a good choice for it's location and value.

Check-in and check-out were very quick and desk clerks were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and big. No complaints on maid service or hospitality services.

We stayed there 11/13/10 thru 11/16/10 in a Spa Suite that over looked The Vegas Strip with views of MGM Grand & NYNY Hotel. The price we paid was the same that we would have paid had we booked a spa suite at Excalibur or Imperial Palace. When we arrived the front desk agent was very friendly, as was all the staff we met during our stay. We didn't have to wait more than 1 minute in the check in line. The only glitch we had was on arrival, they didn't have our suite ready, and were told we would have to wait one hour so they could clean it, and to then check with the desk...meaning we didn't get our room till 6pm, however this was made up for via a resort credit, and the room had a great view from the 28th floor. The room was cleaned daily, and fresh towels and linens were provided daily. We were also happy to find an MP3 hookup to the stereo system. The spa tub is big and is made for 2 people. It's right up against the window for a great vegas view. This room also has a wet bar and fridge that we loved, and a sauna that we didn't use. We loved the layout of this hotel, because the elevators are just off the lobby, along with the food court, and shops. The Casino is big but not unmanageable like some of its neighbors. The hotel doesn't smell like smoke, because they pump a fragrance smell of flowers, but I liked that better than smelling the heavy cigarettes/cigar smoke. The food court has a 24hr McDonald's that came in handy one night. They also have 2 Starbucks on the property. A huge highlight was the Free Tram that runs from Monte Carlo to Bellagio this saved us time, and walking city center is confusing at best, due to all the ongoing construction. We also really liked having the CVS right next door between MC and City Center. Its funny that before this trip we never really considered staying at Monte Carlo, as we had never even set foot on the property, because there isn't much to draw big crowds however this was a great property for us as we go to see shows, gamble, shop, and eat.

I had read all the reviews on TripAdvisor, read the hotel websites, plus much more, and Monte Carlo Vegas seemed like a nice enough hotel to stay in - great location on the Strip, reasonably priced, nice enough rooms. So it seemed. From the moment we arrived in our room after check in, our experience at the Monte Carlo Resort was bad. The room, for starters, didn't look anything like the pictures on their website - instead of a modern, fresh room, we got an old looking room, and to make it worse, hairs in the shower, cracked toilet, and broken air vents. We complained to the front desk, and they moved us to another room. Different room, same experience. Hair in the shower, broken facilities, old room. Moved again for a second time, same experience. Moved again, same thing. Fourth time they moved us to a spa suite at no extra expense. While the room was bigger, the was disgusting thing was that the picture they showed me at the front desk looked nothing like what we got - pictures show a modern room, with modern furniture, the room is old, badly in need of renovation, with old furniture, and an old beat-up TV. When I spoke to the front desk about this, they apologised and said that management made them show the pictures, even though the pictures are of a future renovation, not the current standard!! Instead of staying 5 nights, we left early, and took off as quickly as we could. To make matters worse the staff at the concierge desk (outside of Lucia, who was awesome) were really bad - showed no compassion or interest when my wife was ill and needed a doctor, and sent us on a wild goose chase to The Forum for a cell phone, when the store had closed 5 years ago!!! I'm normally able to handle bad experiences, and have been lucky to have stayed at MGM Grand last time, and had an awesome time. This time, however, Vegas was ruined by Monte Carlo Resort's poor standards and rude staff. I would advise that people seriously think twice before staying here, and be warned that the pictures on their website are false.

Usually go to Vegas up to 4 times a year staying at MGM.Mirage, or Flamingo/Bally's. I got the feeling that the MC is the b--tard child that has been forgotten and ignored by its parent. The first floor lobby and casino were very nice with very friendly and helpful employees. Our room was on the 29th floor. The hallway carpeting was very stained. The room carpet was pulling up. TV would not swival and could not be seen while sitting at the desk. No pen, paper, and only 1 glass. Non smoking room at times smelled of smoke and at other times of skunk. Towels had a burnt smell instead of smelling fresh, We were given a 2 for 1 coupon for the buffet and ate there the first night. OMG!! 6:30 PM on a Saturday night and only 6 tables occupied. The light bulb should have gone off. Oh well. The food on the buffet including the deserts were marginal at best. Ribs were dry and very tough. No cold shrimp. Tried many of the dishes almost all ended up being taken away. The roast beef that was being carved appeared to be very low quality and although I love beef I was afraid to try it. The highlight was the made to order pasta. Chicken alfredo was good except the chicken tasted kind of funny. Atfer this dining experience we were afraid to try the steak house or the Italian restaurant. Ended up eating elsewhere. Room prices were reasonable but I think the Flamingo is in better shape for a similar price. Took the tram to Aria. Walked around for awhile. We didn't see anything special about it. Cosmopolitan, a new hotel and casino, is being built in front of Aria/City Center. When completed it may offer serious competition to the City Center.

We got a good price and knew that the location was great so overall our impressions are broadly positive. The check-in process was pretty quick - we were quite early, only one of our two rooms were ready but the check-in agent gave us both keys and told us the other room would be available mid-afternoon (which it was). . He offered us the choice of two non-adjoining rooms either which were available immediately, good to have had the choice. The rooms were fine, ever so slightly dated as other reviewers have pointed out, but bright, clean and spacious. I would have preferred a more modern shower but for the low price we paid, it was fine. We ate in the buffet one day and were very pleasantly surprised with the quality and choice of the food, this was definitely a good choice and the all-day option was very good value. We had dinner another evening in Diablos, one of the meals (a salmon dish) was great but two of us didn't particularly enjoy ours, probably wouldn't recommend it and it was quite expensive. The casino was fun and the staff friendly - we're not huge gamblers at all so it was more the cheap machines and a few goes on the tables. We enjoyed the free craps lesson too! We loved the pool area but were very disappointed that the hours were so limited - it closed at five which seemed unreasonably early for a heated pool, on the first day we were there we'd planned an early evening swim before dinner but and were very surprised to find it was all closed up. The main negative I have was the sickly-sweet smell of air freshener throughout the public areas. I definitely don't like the smell of smoke but the fake freshener stench wasn't much better. We did get used to it later in our stay but it was not pleasant. An upgraded ventilation system would be the answer. Finally the resort fee was completely ridiculous and pointless, it seemed to be entirely a rip off with no benefit. It was so small that surely it can't be of any real use to the hotel coffers but it left us all with a bad taste in our mouths, feeling a bit ripped off.

All these things were reported to reception only the safe got fixed. Finally getting out of our booked room we decided to go gamble after all its Vegas.. the staff at the Monte carlo are the most miserable useless dealers I have ever met I only ever saw one of them smile. getting a drink wasn't fun there was never a waitress around whilst you were gambling and if you went and found one they would snap at you because you couldn't have a drink unless you were gambling...the dealer on one of our tables took off our winning bet and we had to get into a twenty minute discussion just to get them to check a camera not at all professional The pool area seemed nice except most of the day it was in the shade so completely useless. the hotel it self had a really nice bar but the main night-life was much further down the strip We were checking out early in the morning so I went the night before to settle my bill and raise the issues we had, to be treated like a moron because it was apparently way to hard to print a bill before you had checked out( even though it only took him about 20 seconds eventually) as for the rest of the issues it was some feeble excuse about them not being logged properly he didn't even say sorry!

I was upset and concerned. Another venue? Under Renovation? This was my wedding. I asked the wedding chapel manager why did they not tell me about the renovations and she said the decision came from corporate...At this point she could refund my deposit or I could talk to corporate..... I took one of the options and called corporate and was told by the secretary of the President that they would call back..No one called until I called and a catering manager called back and tried to cover the mistake by saying it would still be lovely....it will be beautiful...if the renovations are not complete we will put you in another venue...a conference room or outside a resaurant....I was even more upset... It was just my fiance and myself getting married. I did not want a conference room or another venue. I wanted the chapel.

While the buffet is a wonderful value at $24.99 a DAY on weekdays and $34.99 a day on Fridays (seafood), Saturdays, and Sundays (champaign brunch), I also appreciated that fact that they had a food court where we could grab an inexpensive breakfact of lunch before heading out for the day. The only drawback is the $12.50 a day resort fee. Even though most all of the big hotel on the strip charge this fee and I knew about it before-hand, I still think it just a sneaky way to get increased revenue. They say it's for the use of the pool, fitness center and wi-fi. Well we used none of those. I would be better if they charged an individual fee for each of these services.

I stayed at MC for the first time in May 2010 on my own and this time I brought my Mother, Sister and her Husband. Previously I have stayed at IP,TI, Flamingo and Ballys in Standard / Deluxe rooms. I agree with all the positive reviews and do not let a few minor faults colour my whole review. The room I had this time was similar to the first visit but without the scratched chair arm where it had hit the underside of the table, the louved door of the closet door had fewer knocks and the suitcase stand had fewer chips. The bathroom, beds and linen were clean as always. The resort fee was still in effect although instead of having two 500ml bottles of water in our room we had a 10dollar beverage coupon to get them from one of the bars. The coupon could be used for \"non-alcoholic beverages or well drinks\". A rum and coke counts as a well drink as the dispense them from those 'guns', so I got that instead and sat and watched the baseball play-offs in the Sports book rather than the Pub. The sports book has cocktail waitress service but as I did not have a sports bet on it would have been a bit cheeky to order a free drink as I do when playing the slots (and I had already been 'told off' by a waitress at the Mirage for requesting a drink without having a bet on!). I rum and coke at the bar is 8dollars! I would have thought it would be a double for that, the free ones while you play are usually singles. We enjoyed the Buffet breakfasts (15dollars+tax) - they had an omlette station and what we had would have cost a lot more in the Cafe. We sometimes had breakfast the foodcourt with the Italian eatery having the nearest to the 'All-American Breakfasts' I enjoy while holidaying in the US (9dollars). We enjoyed an evening meal in the Cafe, especially their ice-cream tower dessert. The previous January, when I was resting in the Mandalay Bay Sports book I was showered by soda! The sports book Director was doing an early morning walk-thru before the main events got going, when he saw someone had left a drinks container in the sports bar sometime in the night. He had dropped it in a bin but it hit the side, the lid came off and I got that shower of soda. Mike apologised and got a towel for me. Thankfully I was able to clean up so that I did not have to go back to my hotel to change - I was staying at the IP that trip. Mike asked me where I was staying and whether I came to Vegas often. I said I sometime came with my family. He said he wanted to do something for me so he gave me his business card and on the back he signed for a free night at the hotel or dinner for four. So this trip we each had a free evening Buffet which we all enjoyed and will visit again, although we will have to pay! This was true old-Vegas hospitality. The catering dept charged the sports book 112dollars for this comp so Mike was not giving away a cheap comp. I will be back in Vegas in January on my own. I do not like the resort fee so I am undecided as to whether I will return then. As a family we will probably be back.

Location is wonderful, we walked to the Aria, and it was quicker than the tram. One big plus is the food court; I got soft drinks for $1@McDonalds. That\u2019s hard to beat on the strip! From reading reviews prior to going to Vegas, I was very concerned about what our experience would be like at the MC. There must be a lot of rooms that are not renovated yet, because ours was great. We stayed @ the Wynn the next 2 nights, and yes, that is an exceptional hotel. We had the fantastic Wynn buffet but still felt we had a favorable experience at MC.

I was there for 5 nights and had my car valet there from day one to 3 took it out on the 3rd and valet it back till the end of the trip. When I took my car the 3rd day of the trip the very nice valet guys opened the doors for me and I sat in my car and drove away. My first stop was the gas station and what did I find? That the side of my car by the gas tank was scratched (but it was perfectly normal when I came to Vegas). I noticed it and drove right back to Monte Carlo, the manager of the valet took pictures, called security, and made a report and told me I should hear back from them in 3 days. Guess what? I heard back from them in a month and what was said to me was even worse. They were not going to pay for the damage because I left their property (even though they had cameras to prove). Now, I am stuck with $1300 in damages.

My first two stays were in the Monaco and Spa suites. This time I stayed in room 23001, a Diamond Suite. The Diamond Suite is two separate rooms, the living room and the bedroom. The living area has a long counter for the wet bar and refrigerator. The is a lot of empty space in this pseudo galley kitchen area that does NOT have a microwave. I got a deal of 30% off on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday (Oct 2, 3 & 4) so the suite cost me inclusive of resort fees and taxes $218.34 for Saturday, and $132.10 for Sunday and also for Monday for a total of $482.55 for the three nights. This averaged to $161/night. For a two room suite, this is a good price for Vegas. The living area is a good sized room with a fold out sofa bed and an eating table. The room also had an old Phillips 34\" HDTV tube television set. There was also a toilet by the entrance. The bedroom was also good sized. In the closet were the usual amenities, safe, iron and ironing board, as well as many wooden hangers. There were also two robes and two pairs of slippers. The bathroom was galley-like and small, but contained the huge Jacuzzi you find in the spa suite and a separate shower. The bed was very comfortable. The was another old Phillips 34\" HDTV tube television set in the bedroom. These old TVs are probably good for renting a movie, but they have very limited TV channels. Yes, I like TV while in bed even in Las Vegas and there is little to offer from the cable they have in the room. They do have the latest movies for rent though. The rooms are a bit warn and in need of a makeover. The windows were filthy. Surprise, you can open the widows a crack. This is a nice feature I like when I can find it in these highrise resorts. This trip, I was in desperate need of a haircut and scheduled a haircut at the salon. A person by the name of Rindy cut my hair. She worked there for the last 12 years. She did a fine job, but she was able to draw me out and converse with me a lot. I'm usually very quiet so she demonstrated exceptional people skills. The front desk check in was very smooth and checking in at 11AM was not a problem. There were times when the hotel was very noisy with young people (in their 20s) who never learned manners. These are the people that scream down the hall to their friends and basically act as if the word revolves around them with no consideration for others. I guess each hotel has their fair share, and the Monte Carlo is no exception. The location of the Monte Carlo is excellent. It is easy to get to all the hotels to the south and across the strip, and with the tram to Bellagio, all hotels mid strip are also within easy walking distance. The hotels on the north end are a bit further, but the walk is not really that bad. Eats are fin in this hotel, with a discount fast food in the food court, to upscale restaurants that will cost you $120+ per person and everything in between. But all eateries Vegas are within walking distance from the Monte Carlo. The Monte Carlo is IMO the best value and location on the strip, even if it is in need of a makeover.

The temperature in the room was perfect. We never had time to take advantage of the pool but from what we saw it was quite nice and maintained. The only thing I didn't care for was the tv. It wasn't a modern flat screen. I had to use their tv internet which was quite cumbersome. We took advantage of the free shuttle from Monte Carlo to Bellagio which happens to go through the new City Center. The Street of Dreams is a nice shopping area in the hotel and we also thought it was nice to have a small food court area nearby in case we wanted to grab something to eat instead of dining out.

We had problem with the Aircon and after complaining, Housekeeping did send across a mechanic. The mechanic told us that the aircon was based on water based cooling and hence not much could be done, something which we could not understand. The job of an airconditioner is to cool irrespective of the mode of cooling. However, he cleaned the vents and changed the filters and there was some improvement but not adequate. This was the one negative,the other one being there was no tea or coffee maker in the room. I was told that this is the case in all Las Vegas hotels, which is surprising since all the Hotels we stayed during our 35 days tour of USA and Canada had this facility. However, Ihaving said that I would like to list the pros as under: 1. Casino on site(I suppose this is true of majority of hotels in Las Vegas) 2. Food Court at the Lobby level with a wide choice of cuisines at fairly reasonale prices so food is never an issue. Some of the stalls are open almost all night. 3. Free train shuttle service between the hotel and the Bellagio Palace Hotel from wher you can witness the awesome fireworks display in the night. Also take in the other sights and hotels like MGM. Paris Hotel with the replica of the Eifel Tower and the Statue of Liberty. 4. Housekeeping service and Room Service were quite attentive 5.

Cheap and quick! The Monte Carlo has a great layout, the lobby and elevators are beside eachother so you do not have to drag your luggage through the casino which is a big plus!!! We were on the 27th floor in tower #2 (?), the room was nice and clean, big bathroom and overlooked the pool area and the new Aria hotel. I must say, they had the MOST comfortable beds and pillows I have ever experienced, very nice! The connecting trams were convenient and useful. The \"food fair\" area is just off the casino and on your way into the mall area. One piece of advise....DO NOT EAT AT THE CHINESE FOOD KIOSK @ MONTE CARLO....unless you want to be sick for your vacation. Pay the extra and go to the Dragon Noodle Co.....very well worth it! The staff were very helpful and polite. And about the \"resort tax\"....it was 14.00 a day for each day stayed, the tax is for phone calls, faxes, and a few other offers which we did not have use for any. The interesting thing is, at the end of our stay the balance was zero, did not get charged the fee. Last year at the Excalibur the same thing happened....but we got a few comps in the process....no comps @ the Monte...which was ok but questionable. The Monte Carlo is at a great location on the strip as well, a little more central. Close to shops and a drug store if need be. Note Canadians: Canadian quarters do not fit in the pop machine...Heheh. All in all, I will definately stay at the Monte Carlo in the future, great price, great rooms, great service. The only drawback for me personally was thesmell of mold on our elevator lobbly area on 27th floor (allergic to mold), and I understand as there was a fire years ago. Not too much of a biggie as you don't spend much time there. Casino was fun, clean and busy, drink service prompt when they did find you. So enjoy, was worth the stay!

I wiped some water off the floors after my son's shower, and the towel turned black. The furniture is dated, so is the T.V. The upside is that you can get a room pretty cheaply. But beware of the mandatory $15.00/night resort fee. It comes with some \"coupons\" that are useless (good luck trying to turn one in for a free drink at the bar- a real joke), but it does include two bottles of water! (6 oz. each), so the room cost does add up. Casino: I'm a member of their \"Player's Club\" - anyone can join. You put the card they issue into any machine you play (also works at the tables) and it keeps track of your playing. At some point enough \"points\" are earned for freebies. I played and spent a lot of money for three days, and didn't earn anything. I checked at the info. desk on my last day, and the attendant gave me a strange, pinched look and said \"maybe you can get a free coffee\". I told her \"no thanks\". While playing the slots, I was offered free drinks numerous times, so that's a plus. Buffet: It's just okay - typical - but I didn't see any seafood items offered the 3 days we were there. For $30.00/person, you can eat at the buffet all day long. You also get to wear a red wristband that tells everyone that you're a glutton. The breakfast seems to be the best bet. Food Court: Your typical food court with more options if you don't want to eat in any of the restaurants (Subway, McDonald's, pizza, etc. Pools: The lazy river used to be the main draw for my family. Now the pool area has turned into a party zone. Lots of drinking, and locals can use the pool all day for a few bucks. Good luck in finding a single lounge chair for a family of 4. If you drink, there looks like a lot of nice, really tall colorful drinks available. Things for kids to do: Nothing but eat and try to squeeze into the lazy river and avoid looking at what they shouldn't be looking at. Monte Carlo used to have an arcade, but it's now part of the shopping area.

We had previously stayed at the Venetian so had high standards with which to compare the MC. The location, the lobby, the staff, the ease of check in and the rooms were fantastic. We particularly enjoyed \"The Pub\" and the buffet was great. The pool area was the best we have seen anywhere on the strip, including Mandalay Bay and the Bellagio. Every weekend there is a pool party which is fun and noisy! Of course you can find a quiet area if you choose, but hey its Vegas! You don't go for a quiet holiday do you? Whilst playing at one of the video roulette tables the power went down, we were asked to return to claim back credit on the machines. When we returned (several hours after we were supposed to) the casino manager 'Donna' came to greet us with our credit and sincere apologies. She led us to the bar and bought us 2 cocktails each of our choosing! Fantastic! She could not have been more helpful. Some of the bigger hotels were full of non residents exploring the hotel, wheras the MC felt more like home. It was easy to navigate and never too busy. The value of this hotel was unbelievable! We booked through an agent and were concerned after reading reviews about the resort fee that we would be confronted with but fortunately there was no problem at all, it was all taken care of in our booking. As for the long line at Starbucks, there are 2! Go to the other one near the tram! The Cupcakery makes the best cupcakes ever! Get the lemon, or Julius...amazing! I was pleasently surprised that the minature toiletries (which were fab) were replenished everyday! The beds were extremely comfortable and the cleaning service was really good too. If you are looking for a great hotel to stay in the heart of the action, this is it! We went to every hotel on the strip and would choose this again over any other!

From what I read on here beforehand I was worried that we should have paid more to stay at a 'posher' strip hotel. That would have been a big mistake. I travelled with my girlfriend and my family, we also had family staying at the Bellagio. From the moment we arrived at the impressive lobby area to check-in, we were treated to excellent customer service from friendly and approachable staff. We asked for two rooms nearby one another, these were quickly allocated to us on the 12th floor. Our room had a view of MGM and the strip area opposite the MC. The room itself was very clean with comfortable beds and a basic but nice enough bathroom. It was not the biggest or best hotel room I have ever stayed in, but for the price it is superb value. Yes, the TV not a flatscreen, and yes, the water drains away from the bath tub a little slowly. But so what?! If these things could ruin your holiday in Vegas, you should be going somewhere else! We never heard any noise from our neighbors or from the corridors during our stay (which is something other reviews often tend to moan about). In my opinion two of the best things about the MC are the pool area and The Pub. The pools are great fun, there is a lazy river, wave pool and a heated pool (which tended to be in the shade) as well as a large jucuzzi. There was always sunbeds available for the 4 of us, I usually chose to relax in the shade with a cold beer but sun-soaked beds were also in good supply. The pool-side music only got loud on Fridays and Saturdays between 12:00-17:00 and even then there were areas where you could lie down and barely hear any music if you prefered to. They really do try to cater for everybody at MC. The Pub is just brilliant, again the staff are all friendly, they serve tasty burgers/flatbreads for a chilled out meal. Best of all though are the happy hour deals which mean you can head out onto the strip having had a good drink with very lttle expense. (Buy one get one free drinks 16:00-19:00 and 21:00-23:00 / also ladies drink free 18:00-19:00 and 21:00-22:00) Excellent! The location of the MC is second to none, with handy transport links such as the tram to City Centre/Bellagio on site, a bus stop outside and the monorail just over the road at MGM. To be honest though, you can walk to just about anywhere from here as long as it's not too hot outside!

The room was clean upon arrival & cleaned daily by staff. The beds were comfy & I never missed a good nights/early mornings rest. Since we were such a large group, we were split into several rooms, however the hotel was very accomodating with ensuring that we were all on the same floor. The pool area is smaller then what I expected, but it was still nice. You have to be up early in order to reserve a lounge chair. On Saturday's there is a DJ & poolside entertainment. The wave pool is NOT a place for small children as most of the entertainment takes place there. Actually VEGAS isn't a place for small children but that's just my opinion. We ordered poolside food/drinks...expect a wait. Poolside staff is friendly & helpful, but very busy. Outside of laying poolside & sleeping at the Monte Carlo, my group & I spent time partying it up in Vegas.

We booked to stay in the Monte Carlo because they offered us a great deal on the rooms.

I was however a bit worried after reading some very negative reviews on here. All my fears went away when we entered the lobby. After a very long flight I was delighted to see no queues for check in! A quick service meant we were in our rooms within 10 minutes. The rooms were fine, basic but clean and tidy with two really comfy beds! Seriously most comfortable bed ever! We never heard a noise during the night, like some reviews have suggested but we were at the side facing new york new york , not an amazing view but hey, you only sleep in your room! The hotel is in a good location with a free tram running to the Bellagio and city centre development which is right next door. The tram is great - especially seeing as its free - and adds some value to the hotel, no need to walk in the heat! The pool is lovely although got very busy at the weekend. Couldnt find a free sun lounger so had to just find a spot near the edge of the pool. There were three pools and a hot tub. There was always an area of the pool area in shadow too which can be a good thing to escape the 100 degree heat! The cabanas were also good value, I think somewhere around $200 on week days which between four of you is pretty good value. There was a minus 5 ice bar in the hotel which is well worth a visit plus a really good steak restaurant (and some other places we didnt try) Right outside is a deuce bus stop which is very convenient too. I wouldnt say this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in but certainly nowhere near the worst, for value for money I couldnt fault it.

The special price was quite good, and we booked early in order to get the lower prices and the specials that were included in the package. The hotel readily honored the price, but the perks were a different story. One extra was simply that 2 bottles of water be provided in the room each day for no cost. Yikes! You would have thought we were asking for the moon when we requested them to honor that one. After much ado, they did finally bring up the water, all at once and against their desire. They said they had discontinued that policy. What? We booked under that agreement and by golly they had to honor it. Our friends had exactly the same reaction from the hotel management. The other things, free drinks mostly, were restricted some, but were easy enough. We had asked for a room with a view of the strip. What we got was a room with a television that did not work, over an extensive roof top. Beyond the roof top we could see the strip, but only the tops of buildings. We changed rooms because they could not fix the television, and the view was then of the pool complex, which was better than an ugly rooftop. The rooms were clean enough, but the furnishings were austere at best. Our friends' rooms all had small things that did not work, like the sink. The staff was efficient and friendly. The lobby and desk were just fine. The casino felt dirty and was less crowded than the other, more upscale hotels, so that was really a relief once the weekend crowds arrived. Some of the machines did not work, though, and the staff in the casino were really of little assistance. We did find a restaurant, The Cafe, that was inexpensive, polite, and served very good food. The Mexican restaruant, El Diablo, was also quite nice; Okay service, but good food. Of course, the location of this hotel is good, central to the Vegas strip and other quality hotels and activities. We will not be staying at the Monte Carlo again. The other hotels in the area offer good deals and feel more upscale. It just is not agreeable to be on vacation and have to fight for what you paid for. I prefer to be where I get what is agreed upon without negotiation or the hassle of having to change rooms. I also prefer to have more well appointed rooms. I must say, though, that the rooms we had were large. Staff was good. Noise level on the floors, appointment of rooms, upkeep of common areas and rooms, honoring of agreement were all an irritant. All in all, the Monte Carlo is an average hotel with both good and bad points.

It seems, however, that the rooms need a refresh. My husband and I checked in on a Friday and were thrilled to have been given a room on the 31st floor that overlooked the pool. Until, that is, we HEARD the pool music, bass, announcements, vibrations, etc. Would this go on all day?? No, it would stop at 6pm, and it did, on the dot. There is one more floor on top of the 31st floor, and it's called \"Hiotel 32\". It's the same hotel with a swanky name. Apparently, the rooms must have hard woods in them because all of a sudden at 4:30am, a herd of horses made their way into my ceiling and clomped their way around their room on those hardwoods and woke me up. Wait - what was that noise? Men laughing? Girls screaming? Oh, bad dream. It wasn't horses after all. It was the loud, obnoxious guests in the room above me coming in from their night on the town, clomping through, heels and all, on that hardwood floor that REVERBERATED my room, shook my ceiling and me up until they simmered down at around 5:45. That was a big mistake in the design of the rooms above. My advice - stay lower than 31 so the people above you have CARPET! The room itself was old. The tv was old and the picture quality was fading. The armoire wouldn't close all the way and was completely scratched up. The room was dusty and I kept sneezing. The bathroom was extremely clean, however the towels smelled like they had been by a camp fire or something because they had an awful smoky smell which in turn, permeated my hair since I used it and then smelled it. The toiletries are ok and basic. Compared to what I saw at the Bellagio, another MGM property, these were low grade. The pool looked inviting and was kept clean. It was busy and LOUD. I was really glad that the noise stopped at 6. The folks that worked there were spot on GOOD. Every person I came in contact with totally rocked it and was professional. The weekend we were there, all the MGM properties system went down and no one could use their slot card to play, earn points, nothing. They were also having to do hand pay outs for any transaction, regardless of the amount. I sat waiting on a $1 payout for 15 mins and DH made me walk away. And it wasn't just the MC - it was ALL MGM properties. The restaurants were good. We ate breakfast at the cafe and it was over priced but tasty. Also used the food court a lot too - McDonalds, Subway and Manchu Wok. All hot, quick and tasty. The free tram to Aria and Bellagio was nice, too. Will save you some $ by not using cabs. The walk was not bad at all. The Inferno Lounge added towards the back by Diablos was a nice addtion. Now get the rest of the hotel done. I would recommend this to anyone who is on a budget that needs a clean place to stay with no frills, where its easy to get to your room. The rooms are really in need of an update and refresh.

When we telephoned the Monte Carlo, we were also told that the chapel was undergong renovation and that it should be completed by the day of our wedding. We were assured that if it wasn't completed, we could be married in one of ther conference rooms or a venue outside a restaurant. This was completely unacceptable to us! This was not what we were sold and did not meet our expectations. We complained to the President of the Monte Carlo and his staff. Their response was that we should be happy that the chapel's 12 year old carpet was being replaced and we should be happy. Of course, we weren't expecting worn out carpeting in the first place. We then called public relations and they couldn't understand why we didn't want to get into a limo to travel to a different venue for a wedding. This might be acceptable to others, but if that is what we wanted we would have booked that for our wedding. After all, Vegas has dozens of \"other\" wedding venues.

It just happened to be our 36th anniversary. We arrive at the Monte Carlo in the morning and we were able to check-in right away. We were in our room within a half hour. We were in a standard room on the 15th floor looking out to pool area. It was not fancy, but very clean. It was a typical Vegas standard room. We have been going to Vegas for 20 years 2-4 times a year and the rooms are not that much different. We have stayed at he Monte Carlo a few times in the past and each time have had good time. We stayed this time because it was good price for airfare and room booked through Expedia. The pool area was nice with a wave pool and a lazy river like many have said. There were many famlies there, but it was not a problem for us. We had a good time at the pool area. Yes the chairs were close together, but so are many other places. It was not a concern, No problem finding a place to sit. We always do go during the week and I would suppose it is busier on the weekend. We found all the employees we had contact with friendly and helpful if needed. We had no concerns with the room. I like the casino because it is easy to get around and you will not get lost. If you enjoy drinks while you play, the beverage servers were always coming around. We played in many places in the area and they were the best at the Monte Carlo. We ate at the Pub it was expensive. 2 hamburgers and fries and 2 malts cost $55. thought it was high. They do have good happy hours in places. Ladies drink free for an hour at one of the bars there for an hour. We did buy the all day buffet one day $30. We ate all three meals and a couple more extra times for just a snack. It was fine. Breakfeast was the best. My wife liked all the desserts. We ate a couple more times there also because we got some free buffets. There resort fee was $12.95 plus tax. I did use the fitness area. I hate the resort fee but it is stated on Expedia if you book through them. TI has the highest I no of $22 a night. Most table games during the week are from $5 any up. Slots of Fun I know have cheaper table games. I like the Monte Carlo because it is a good location to other casinos also without walking a great distance. New York New York is close and so is Excaliber and then you can take a tram to Mandayla Bay and Luxor. There is also a tram from the Monte Carlo to Aria and Belligo. We spent a day downtown and had a fun time. The casinos are close together and the food is alot cheaper. We had a nice prime rib at the Four Queens Rest. for under $20 with a player's card. We got a lot of free play by using are card at the Monte Carlo and at TI. We are not big buck players. We had good time like always and the Monte Carlo was fun and would stay there again, but we always look for a good deal. I am going to look for a place without a resort fee next time. Some places do not have a resort fee any more. We will going back in a few months. Maybe downtown this time. I like the Golden Nugget. If your are going in the future have a good time.

Given that we had stayed in several motels along the way, we were excited to see what this hotel had to offer. We felt slightly overwhelmed when we first arrived as the lobby was massive and very loud and crowded. It felt like the interior of a major railway station. There were long lines to check in and the downside was definitely queuing for the elevators, which were very slow to arrive and invariably too crowded to accommodate everyone. We thought our room itself was clean and spacious and as we were located on the 26th floor, we had a fantastic view of the strip. The bathroom too, was of a very high standard. We were disappointed with a few things however. Even some of the more basic hotels we had stayed in had free wi-fi, flat screen tv and refrigerator facilities. We had expected these features and were disappointed not to have them. Also, I was unwell during the day, and despite having a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door and my husband explaining the situation, the housekeeper kept trying to get in which was every annoying. We were very impressed with how central the hotel was, the eating and shopping facilities and the pool area. Yes, the pool area was very crowded but then you would expect that in August with temperatures of over 100 outside. I would also mention that we were very impressed with the free car parking valet service - very much appreciated by us after a long drive.

Now you don't get water but a coupon for $10.00 off a drink purchase in one of their bars. Our room was a king room on the 14th floor overlooking the pool area. The room was very basic, nothing fancy. I was surprised, as I really expected a more elegant room. The bed was comfortable and there were ample pillows. The bathroom was just that, plain and simple. The tub was slow to drain, as I've seen this complaint on here more than once. Housekeeping did a great job on the rooms and they were always done in a timely fashion. The only thing is they never replaced our drinking glasses during the 3 days...not a big deal though, but I just thought it was odd. If you are there on a weekend and want to nap during the day, avoid rooms that face the pool. The music is VERY loud from around 11am-7pm. It is nearly impossible to drown out the music/bass with your tv. It did get very irritating after awhile. The pool area is great. There is 1 wave pool, 1 lazy river, and 1 regular pool. Sat and Sun were pretty crowded, but did find a lounger. By Monday, the crowds were gone. You can not bring in any outside food/drinks. They do search your bags. So plan on spending $6.00 for a bottle of \"Monte Carlo\" water. The mixed frozen drinks were $10 and up. The pool hours are 8am-7pm. The breakfast buffet there was HORRIBLE! The price was $15/person and sooooo NOT worth it. There was a very limited selection of food. The eggs were watery and the bisquits hard as a rock. There is a food court with McDonalds, Subway, Starbucks, and some other food options. Not so sure I would stay here again, especially if the \"Resort Fees\" are still in place.

We chose the Monte Carlo based on price through Southwest Vacations and from reviews of the property. We were seeking a hotel on the strip that has a fantastic pool and was geared towards adults. After all, the majority of us were getting away from husbands and children for the weekend before school started. The hotel did accomodate us by finding adjoining rooms for us so that was a plus in the beginning. Our disappointment started when we arrived up in our room. During our 4 day stay at the hotel, the air conditioner was not working properly. The thermometer said 68 degrees, but it was more like 78 degrees! Sleeping at night was extremly uncomfortable due to no air. The wallpaper was peeling off of the wall near the window sill. The bathroom shower had tarnished brass fixtures. The room had not been renovated in some time. The pool facilities were very nice, but no where in all the reviews I read did it say this was a \"family friendly\" hotel. There were families and KIDS everywhere! Instead of being at an adult venue, we felt like were staying at a Disney World property. The pool / acquatic center closed at 7:00 PM EACH day. The pub did provide ladies complimentary beer during happy hour. We found some of the servers / bartenders to be on the rude side and not geared towards accomodating their guests. Beverages at the Pub were also watered down and definitely not a good value for our money. We attempted another happy hour in the lounge called \"Brand\". The atmosphere was nice and food was quite tastey, but our waitress was not on her game. We found that our food items had been lost or forgotten about and one of our items never made it to the table. When we asked the waitress and the manager about it, they simply said \"we ran out\". It would have been nice to tell us that when we placed our order so we could have opted for something else. Overall, if you are looking for a budget friendly hotel - The Monte Carlo is definitely for you. If you are seeking the \"WOW\" factor, please go on down the road to Mandalay Bay.

Louder music means louder conversations, hence overall louder experience. I paid extra for a high floor room. In retrospect, didn't need it as we were only in the room to change and sleep. Never even turned on the TV. Could have save a few $$$ and picked a lower room.

We ate breakfast and dinner at the buffet, and both were good. Breakfast had lots of variety and everything tasted good. Dinner entrees had great flavor, but the desserts were lacking and staff was slow to replenish them. Food court was great for a quick drink or snack - thrilled with the dollar menu! Our daughter ate at D.Vino and had the $1.99 breakfast in the Cafe, and dinner at the Pub and said all were really good. We had no trouble finding lounge chairs at the pool, and no big complaints about the pool area. It does seem more closed in than it used to pre-City Center, when it still had tennis courts. There is a sand volleyball court, though. We knew about the resort fee up-front - does seem like a rip-off, and hopefully a trend that will go away soon.

Not 1 coupon per day, 1 coupon total. So I go take the $10 coupon to the bar and I got exactly two 8 oz bottles of water.

Pool - Again, arrived on Thursday so getting a spot of Friday wasn't a problem. Arrived at the pool early on Saturday, and it filled up quick. 3 pools in this area. The lazy lagoon got a bit crowded, but it was 114 degrees, so it was expected. Friendly waitresses (not bad to look at either) - Decent price on buckets of beer on ice! Ate lunch at THE PUB's outside patio one afternoon. THE BEST cheeseburger I have ever eaten. We ALL had great food - again, very friendly waiter and server. Casino - Easy to navigate from one end to the other. Didn't play any tables, but watched a while. Dealers seemed to be pretty involved and friendly. Especially EARLY in the mornings after the sun had come up and some of the young women were walking back through to get to their rooms (walk of shame?) Very funny and friendly!! There was a food court there with some chain restaurants for a cheap, quick, late night meal or snacks. I'm from Dayton, OH and I'm not associated with this hotel at all. I just wanted to share all the positive things about the Monte Carlo. We made a last minute hotel change due to bad reviews at another nearby location (not New York - New York) so I wanted to share the positive and good things here. I will be returning to Las Vegas for a convention in February and I suggested to my boss that we stay here for the week.

No big deal in my opinion. Our room was comfortable and clean although a little worn. The bathroom was large and clean with a great shower. Our room had a nice view of the pool and the Aria at City Center. If you're here to watch TV then beware you're limited to 13 channels. But then, if you come to Vegas to watch TV maybe you should reconsider your plans. The elevators to your room are right at the edge of the casino so getting back for a nap is a snap! (I'm over 50, I need a nap!) They were featuring an all-day buffet pass for $30.00 per person which in my opinion is a great bargain . You can come and go from 7 am to 10pm and have all you want. The buffet is one of the better ones on the strip, especially for the price. It has a great variety of cuisines and custom cooking stations. It's roomy, airy, and has a simple elegance. There is also a very nice food court in the casino that is open 22 hours a day. (Closed from 3 am to 5 am) It's great for a quick bite or that first cup of coffee in the morning. You can take a short 10 minute walk from the Monte Carlo through a typical shopping mall to the Aria, the fantastic new casino at City Center. At the end of the same corridor is a tram to the Bellagio and Excaliber. This is really convenient because the walks to the other casinos on the strip can be deceptive. They're right next door to each other, but due to their massive grounds the walks can be daunting. From the Monte Carlo, the walk to NY-NY and MGM is quick. But for others it's taxi time. You can also catch the Deuce bus which goes up and down the strip, but my experience is it's faster to walk. The buses stop too often and are often full. The Monte Carlo Casino is very open and the staff is friendly and helpful. During our trip the slots at both the Monte Carlo and the Aria were loose and generous.

The room was quite high and faced the strip so the view was absolutely AMAZING especially at night. The only restaurant I ate at was the buffett. It was good with alot of selection and the waiting staff were friendly. I spent a little time in the casino in the evening and thought it was fine. Nothing great, just a casino. The waitresses had good service as well. I don't remember there being much to do or see in this hotel but it was fine for the price. I think the price paid was great for the elegance and comfort.

When we arrived, staff was friendly and the room was average. I admitted at the time after Bellagio, nothing seems that gorgeous in comparison. But I had no real complaints until we decided to take an afternoon nap. I was surprised how many people were out and about in the middle of 110 degree weather; we are from AZ and used to it, but are for sure night people and were staying up really late on vacation. Our room was on the 10th floor above the pool, which apparently has blasting music with ridiculous bass from 10:00am to 7:00pm. It's not unreasonable for them to play music for the people at the pool, but do I have to hear it and feel its vibrations ten stories up? I'm cranky when I'm tired so I was pretty bothered by this. We just left the room without a nap and walked around some other casino. Additionally, the pool music woke me up the next morning. The walls are paper thin and we both woke up throughout the night multiple times to people in other rooms flushing their toilets and other plumbing noises. The sheets in our room had a couple holes on the fitted one, and there was popcorn on our floor. From the time we checked in, room service dishes were stacked outside other rooms lining our hallway, and stayed there until the time we checked out. We did see two shows at the Monte Carlo Theater during the week, and when we said we stayed at Bellagio they automatically offered 50% discount for the show. When we returned to see another show, I asked if they offered any deals since we were staying at this hotel, and they informed me that only because I asked, they would give me 25 percent off. We did not initially expect any discount prior, but when you tell people you're staying at Bellagio, you do get a better response, usually including, \"Oooooh!\" Finally, as if I wasn't cranky enough from poor sleep, Monte Carlo has some other sewage issues going on between the theater and their bar Diablo. You can smell this stench from the outside on the strip all the way into the hotel near the bar/theater entrance. I don't know how people can eat or drink outside while surrounded by this smell. Apparently during this trip, I became a Bellagio snob and will book there for future trips. One last point: although we booked last minute at Monte Carlo, it was more expensive than any of the days at Bellagio since I booked in advance. It is well worth it to book a couple months prior.

I think all hotels now charge a 'resort fee' which includes the internet service (wired or wireless). I've always gotten the internet fees as I need to be able to work through VPN so the 'added' bonus of 2 bottles of water is nice. It is an older hotel and does not have a wet bar or fridge. The rooms are average and the pool is ok. They do have a 'wave' river where you can float around all day but there's nothing spectacular about the pool. The hotel is located a little south on the strip and isn't near the Tram. You can walk a block or two to MGM Grand and catch a tram from there to get to the Convention Center or the other hotels.

The hotel is not a four star hotel but it was perfectly fine and met our expectations. No wait for Thursday afternoon check in nor Sunday morning departure. Had non-smoking, 2- Queen beds available as I requested. Very good/nice employees throughout the weekend. Very nice clean room. One thing the rooms need is to replace the older television sets but even that didn't matter to us as we don't spend very much time in the rooms anyway. Food: We miss the brew pub but enjoyed the beer pub. They have replaced the excellent oven baked pizzas with flatbread ones. They had a very good acoustic guitarist playing to an indifferent crowd on Thursday evening. She was very good. $145 for three people, Overpriced for what it was. We just had 2-3 beers each. There is a very crowded Starbucks in the food court. If you walk 2 minutes down past the Pub and retail on the way to Aria you will find a larger, less crowded one. Pool: The pool was relaxing on Friday afternoon. I wish they played a little more pop music and a little less rap music. Both the pool and lazy river were good and crowded. The water was noticably less clean on Saturday. Easy to get a chair both afternoons. The resort is aiming for a younger, stupider crowd.

I thought the location of the Monte Carlo was very good, within walking distance to several shops and other hotels, and it even had a free tram that went to the Bellagio. All the hotels are so big, make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes! The first night we were there we took a taxi everywhere which got expensive. I recommend taking the bus - only $7 for a 24 hour unlimited pass. There were also quite a few things to do within the hotel. I was really glad that the Monte Carlo had a food court with places like McDonalds and Subway, Vegas gets really expensive so it was nice to have a cheaper option for lunch or late night snacks. The Pub was also a pretty cool place to hang out as well. I think Monte Carlo had one of the better casinos, lots of slot machines and card tables, and never too crowded. The pool area was really fun, especially if you like to party! There were music and games, and they also had really good drinks (get the peach bellini!!). All the shows and attractions in Vegas are pretty expensive, but there are some free things to do: see the fountains at the Bellagio, the volcano at the Mirage, the lions at the MGM Grand, the pirate show at Treasure Island, and you definitely need to go downtown to Fremont Street (one of my favs!). We arrived on a Wednesday night, which turned out to be a really good idea. We were able to do most of the sightseeing Wednesday and Thursday. By Friday, everywhere was considerably more crowded. Also, I would not recommend bringing young kids. There is drinking, gambling, and 'adult entertainment' everywhere you look. One last thing - you should visit Toby Keith's Bar and Grill in Harrah's. The bartenders were amazing and they had a live band and dance floor with lots of two-stepping! If I went to Vegas again, I would probably stay at the Monte Carlo again.

I use to go to Vegas two or three times a year before I got married now it's once every one or two years. I had the low end room and it was still very nice. I don't have any complaints. I had a view of the strip mainly MGM and it was very nice to look out the window. I come to Vegas to let loose and to have a good time. I just gamble and drink beer all day long. Not much else. Monte Carlo is a resort and has everything you want and you really don't ever have to leave. I wouldn't advise that. They have a food court there with four or five fast food restaurants and they have a dinner along with several fancy restaurants. There is to be a time when you could get good food at reasonable prices. Those days are gone. All MGM properties now have a nightly resort fee, which I think is a BIG rippoff. You do get two bottles of water (first night only), a free daily newspaper (ruppee!) and access to the fitness center. If you want to use the sauna etc... it is an additional $5 charge. My problem with the resort fee is that you are being charge for something you didn't want in the first place. The pool area is nice. It has a lazy river that kids to adults will enjoy.

Decent value. The reviews indicated that it had deteriorated since I last stayed here, four years ago, but I didn't notice. We wanted a nice hotel with a clean, quiet room, good pool and casual dining options. It was fine for our purposes. Breakdown: Location - Okay. Tram to City Center and Bellagio was convenient. Bus stop across the street (which is at least a block and a half, as all distances in Vegas are exaggerated). Check-in/out - fast, friendly. Surprised by a mandatory $15 per room/night \"resort charge,\" which includes pool use, unlimited long distance, business center, and a bunch of other stuff that I assumed was included in the room rate. Oh well. We were charged $20 for a call from the room, which should have been included. It was removed. Room - clean, spacious, no bed bugs, no problem. Oddly, the maid put a bag of tobacco on our bathroom counter. She said she found it in the wastebasket. EIther it was hers, or our basket wasn't emptied before we left. But why would someone leave a full bag of tobacco and rolling papers? We didn't smell smoke in the room. I could hear the TV in the next room, faintly, and in the hallways you can hear people talking inside the room. But this wasn't a disturbance, and I'm easily disturbed. Pool - crowded, a bit of a party scene. There's a small freeform pool, a lazy river, a large wave pool, and a hot tub. There were leaves and straws in the freeform pool, but it didn't stop me from enjoying myself. The chairs are smooshed together (touching, so you can't step between them unless you space them out) and stacked three or four rows deep. Some people line up at 7:30 to get their choice of chair when the pool opens at 8. If you really want a great spot, the best shady spot, or need a lot of chairs together, this is a good idea. You can put towels on chairs and save them. There were still plenty of chairs available by noon. Plentiful towels. Rental innertubes for the lazy river. Very stiff pool drinks.

Our room at the Monte Carlo struck me as a lower-quality version of the MGM Grand (with correspondingly lower prices). It was a good choice and we'd stay there again. Very clean room on arrival and it was perfectly cleaned and made up both days. The pool area is great and was not a full-on party zone - lots of people in the pools but I would not say it had a spring break atmosphere at the time we were there. There are sexier pools in Vegas which attract that crowd - this was just your average hotel guest assortment. There are a bazillion deckchairs so it didn't seem like the crowd was a problem. Be sensible though; my friend had her bag and wallet stolen off a deckchair when she left it unattended. The lifeguards aren't there to remember several hundred people and who owns which bag. The casino area is one of the least smokey I've found. People were definitely smoking in there, but it was barely noticeable unless you were actually right next to a smoker. Compared to most casinos where the stench is appalling to a non-smoker, this alone makes the Monte Carlo worth my money. As some other reviews mentioned, the walls are paper thin and you WILL hear everything from the next room. Ear plugs are a good idea if you're a light sleeper. We were next to what sounded like a freakin' daycare center. Come on people, don't bring your dozens of screaming toddlers to Vegas and then leave them in the room all day, okay? Go to Disneyland instead and we'll all be much happier. The bathroom was okay. Nothing fancy, but clean and with all the usual amenities (soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, magnifying shaving/makeup mirror), good towels, good water pressure in the shower. The tub was slow draining and once you pull the shower curtain closed it is very dimly lit in there - not too bad, just a minor annoyance. Air conditioning in the room was good, with digital thermostat controls. The bed was comfortable, with a sheet, thin cover thingy (you really don't need a comforter in Las Vegas so I don't know why some people mention the lack of huge thick blankets as a drawback) and a big pile of about six pillows. I used the spa (had a Swedish massage and also checked out the sauna, steam room etc) and it was excellent. Small, but peaceful and nicely designed. The massage was one of the best I've had anywhere. My masseur was a guy called Jose and he was fantastic. We ate elsewhere for most meals but did go to The Cafe restaurant for brunch. The food was great but our group of five waited forever for service and some mistakes were made when the food finally turned up. To their credit, the wait staff were very apologetic and comped us some of the dishes without even being asked. The relatively small size of the Monte Carlo means you're not wasting half of each day just walking through the hotel/casino. Unlike most Vegas casino resorts, you don't feel like you need a GPS and a team of Sherpas to find your way from one end of it to the other.

The pool, casino and food court (McDonalds/Subway/Sbarra, etc.) are all located together just off the elevators. The pool was usually busy with music playing. Lots of lounge chairs. There is a sand volleyball court at one end and a large hot tub that holds about 15 people. The room (12-222) was clean. Good A/C. The television was a little out-dated (not a flat screen), but it worked just fine. We got extra towels from the housekeeper. She gave them to us off her cart.

The bed was comfy and the AC worked well. Staff was courteous and helpful. No bugs, no slow draining drains, no noise, and no coffee maker, as reported in previous posts. It's just that for Las Vegas, we expected more. Our room looked like it had not been updated in 15 or 20 years. Quite ragged around the edges. Old style smaller tube TV. The entire hotel looked that way. We saw Lance Burton at the Monte Carlo - he's been playing there for 14 years - and even the show and theatre looked old and dated. But it was a good show - you can get discount tickets at the ticket office in the big Coke Bottle across the street. We also saw Love at the Mirage - great show. Best seats are the cheap ones, high and in the back. We did lunch buffets at Wynn's and Paris. Wonderful! And tried the breakfast buffet at the Monte Carlo. Not so good and very overpriced at $14.95 pp. Of course that $12.95 resort fee doesn't seems justified. But the good news about that is that it includes ifree in-room internet (not wi-fi, but the kind where you plug in the cable). Bottom line - the Monte Carlo is fine if you're happy with a 2 1/2 star hotel and can get it cheap. Just don't book with any higher expectations. Next time we'll stay elsewhere.

The course was located at the Monte Carlo and he did not have a choice of hotels. If we were the ones paying for the room, we would not have chosen Monte Carlo, but it was decent enough for our 3 night stay. Check-in We arrived at 11 am and were told our room would be ready in about 30 minutes. We were pleasantly surprised that it would be ready so quickly. They went ahead and assigned our room to us and gave us our key, which was nice that we did not have to return to check-in. The service at the front desk was polite, but definitely not friendly. We decided to grab lunch and return later in the afternoon. Room We were given a room on the fourth floor with a slight view of MGM. I was a little disappointed in the view, but we had not asked for a room with a nice view at check-in, so I did not have any reason to complain. I hated that the room was so dark and dimly lit, though! It made it difficult when getting ready in the evening. The safe was also really narrow and small. However, the bed was comfortable and we did sleep well at night. Of course, our exhaustion in the evenings may have also contributed to our deep sleep. I would compare the room to that of a Hampton Inn. There was never a long wait for the elevators, which was nice. Location I did not really care for the location of the hotel. It seems there are more families with kids in this area of the strip, with NYNY and MGM so close. We also like to gamble and dine near Caesars/Bellagio, so the location was not convenient for our evening activities. We prefer to stay mid-strip for this reason alone. Pool I did not care for the pool area. The lounge chairs were dirty and packed together. There were dirty cups left all over and never picked up by staff. Cocktail service was pretty non-existent. It was easier to just walk over to the bar than wait for a server. The drinks were also not good. The cannot make a margarita to save their lives. There are 3 separate pools: a regular pool, a lazy river pool, and a wave pool. I liked the regular pool the best. It was small, but pretty calm compared to the lazy river and wave pool. Plus, the small size meant the sun warmed the water very easily and it felt quite nice. Overall I did not really care for the hotel, but it was a decent place to sleep at night on the strip. I did not like the location. If we were paying ourselves, we would not choose this hotel. If I had to pick a hotel on the strip on a budget, I would check rates at Flamingo.

Room Quality - this is the only thing about MC that can use an upgrade in my opinion. Room was clean, but seemed worn. Mattress seemed to be worn on the side by the nightstand. Weird thing was there were no comforters on any of the 4 beds in our rooms. When we asked, we were told that the hotel is looking for a more modern look and is doing away with them. Another family member's king room did have one however. It was just weird - maybe they're doing away with all of the stained/burned ones? I'd rather have none than one with cig holes, though. Bathroom was fine, nothing fancy, but clean as well. Overall, we didn't go to Vegas to sit in the room, so a little dated was fine by us. Pool - this is why we booked, and glad that we did. Excellent options for a small child, but not too overwhelming either. There were plenty of chairs, and shade or sun was available all day. Good mix of young singles & families. Neither one was obnoxious. Other reviews mention the music being too loud - did not find that at all. It was a good volume. Pool bar was quick & friendly & drinks were not short on the spirits! Hotel Layout - this was the best surprise for us. MC is not a HUGE hotel/resort that requires tons of confusing walking through the casino. From the main elevator banks, you're within sight of the pool entrance, food court, lobby, and shopping. So if you're at the pool and want to run up to your room or to the food court, it's not a major trek. Restaurants - food court is convenient & has a lot of choices: Subway, McDonalds, Sbarro, Mexican place, Chinese place, Haagen Daz, and Starbucks. Expect to pay 30% more than at home. Nice to have other quick options while on vacation. Ate at Diablo's Cantina - food was a little above average, but overpriced - but while on vacation, it's to be expected. Margarita pitcher for $30 seemed to be virgin - would not recommend. The Pub was very good with a lot more dining options than I thought. The buffet was a typical Vegas buffet. Ate twice there and was pretty much the same both evenings. Breakfast buffet offered the typical fare as well. Service - overall very friendly & good at check in, restaurants, bell desk, pool bar, dealers & drink service while gambling. Have no complaints whatsoever. Misc - enjoyed having the tram to City Center and Bellagio, was very convenient to get around. Shops were fine, but nothing over the top or lacking. Very middle class, which is fine by me!!!! MC seems to have a new tagline of 'unpretentiously luxurious.' I would agree 100%. If you're used to someone waiting on you hand and foot, this may not be for you.

We went to Diablos, where the service was lacking, seemed like they were understaffed. The chips and salsa were good, so were the nachos and fajitas. They have a happy hour where we got $3 XX and a wheel and they spin it every hour for specials-$5 patron shots while we were there. We went to the buffet there one night, which was $20 for dinner and nothing special, but everything I tried I liked (still, they were supposed to have \"creat your own\" hibachi and pasta stations and no one seemed very interested in cooking at those for us), we ate at Dragon Noodle which was a giant portion (split with my spouse and still didn't finish) again, it wasn't anything special but it was good, expensive ($18 for a plate of noodles with chicken, 2 shrimp, beef) but that's Vegas. I liked the tram to Bellagio, we saw O, and to City Center (walked through but nothing even remotely inviting, just a lot of high-end designer stores, I like Planet Hollywood shops better where they have a mix of retailers). I have stayed a lot of places on the strip. This isn't as nice as Mandalay, or MGM, but it's nicer than Ex Calibur and the location is really great. We walked everywhere and rarely took cabs. I didn't eat at the food court, but it's convenient to have McDonalds, Rubios, Subway, Machu Wok, so you don't have to spend $20 on every meal. The $15/night \"resort fee\" is outrageous though, and I would consider that in the room price in the future. The resort fee includes the gym and interneet, which I didn't use, and the bottles of water are the tiniest bottles I have ever seen! Housekeeping does come late in the day for stay-over rooms. Oh, and I should mention a nice thing, my spouse left an ipod in the safe and when he called they send someone up to get it and will fedex it back to us, which is nice and makes me feel better about having stayed there.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cMemorial Day and My daughter's 21st Birthday was Wonderful here\u201d", "Author": "HavingFun33", "ReviewID": "UR66196600", "Content": "I've stayed at the Monte Carlo previous times with friends, dates, and now my daughter's 21st Birthday.

Knowing that Vegas isn't exactly kid-friendly, we looked up \"family friendly\" hotels, and the Monte Carlo showed up on several lists. We figured that with the wave pool and lazy river, we'd be good. We arrived on a Saturday, and after lunch, went to the pools. Whoa. The pool area was packed with 20-somethings in tattoos and skimpy outfits jiggling to the hard-driving thumping music, drinking everywhere, including in the pools (the pool rules specifically prohibit this, but no one stopped it). We had to stay for a little while because the kid was desperate for the pool, and we eventually managed to find seats that weren't right in front of the DJ. But the lazy river was pointless because it was filled edge to edge with the party crowd. The room was OK. A bit drab, not exactly deluxe, even though it was a Monaco Suite. The location was near the elevators, and those pool people like to party late. Every time some of them came home, they'd wake us up, sometimes with choice language. Others in our group were lucky enough to have an all night party next to them. The next morning, we took advantage of hangover time to join other weary families and get the kids some pool time. It was much quieter, but we couldn't help but be a little creeped out by what may be floating around us. The hotel had quite a few visible areas that needed additional post-party cleaning. This was Memorial Day weekend, and we weren't looking forward to another party-filled Sunday evening, so we decided to see what the hotel could do. We talked with the Assistant Manager for the Monte Carlo Hotel. We calmly explained our dissatisfaction. She was very professional and polite. She explained how the hotel had recently changed marketing campaigns that is now attracting more of the \"night club scene.\" I asked if we could change rooms, but she said all of the suites were in the same general location, so that probably wouldn't help. She offered us a free meal. We asked about changing hotels and she said that if we could confirm a reservation at another hotel, she would be happy to work with us to get us out of our reservation. We confirmed a suite with Vdara, called the Asst Mgr back, and she did what she promised. We'll never be back to the Monte Carlo, but at least the staff was very professional. The Vdara was a huge upgrade, and since there's no casino there, it's probably more suited to families - at least as much as Vegas can be.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNo coffee pot in the room!\u201d", "Author": "Idaho_Travel_Bug", "ReviewID": "UR65933215", "Content": "We chose this hotel because of the pricing and pools. The outside of the hotel is beautiful. The check-in area is also beautiful. They have elevators that go to certain floors which is really nice. We were on the 21st floor, so we got on the elevator that went from floor 13 to floor 23. This way the elevators don't take so long and there are not so many people in each elevator. There were 6 elevators for our floors. You never had to wait long for one. When we got to our floor, it opened up into a huge area and there are 3 different hallways. We found our room easy enough. We had a room with two queen beds. The rooms were very spacious. There was a huge window that we got to see the beautiful view, unfortunately it was out the back of the hotel and not the strip view, but it was still nice. I was very surprised that the rooms did not have flat screen tv's. My friend had stayed at Harrah's which is an older hotel, and they even had a flat screen tv in the bathroom. Monte Carlo certainly didn't have that which is unfortunate. The thing I didn't like at all was that there was no coffee pot with coffee in the room. Why would they not have that? I didn't like that at all. You could order coffee which was $5.95 for 3 cups and $8.95 for 6 cups. I didn't do that because my friend doesn't drink coffee and I don't think I could have drank 3 cups by myself. You could also go downstairs to Starbucks or McDonalds to get coffee which is what I ended up doing, but by the time it was 11 am and I really like my coffee right when I get up. Monte Carlo really needs to change that. I also am shocked that they had a cable for internet service. Yes it is free, but to have to hook up to a cable is ridiculous. All the big hotels in Las Vegas should have fre wi-fi. I could not get on the internet if my friend was on the internet. Very frustrating. The beds were very comfortable and I slept well. However, there was no comforter on the bed! Each bed had a sheet, a light blanket and the another sheet; that's it! We had to turn the heat on to keep warm. The bathroom has the sink in the bathroom and I've never liked that, but you deal with it. Our tub/shower did not drain well at all. There was always about an inch or two of water in the bottom of the shower. I hate that. They have nice quality amenities in the bathroom. The rooms seem to be quiet. I didn't hear anything from the rooms next to us and above us. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel. I did like having the little food court downstairs. I got my coffee from McDonalds in the morning and then one day I ate at the Mexican fast food place called Rubio's. It was very good. The have an area to eat. I would loved to have tried some of the restaurants, but we weren't there long enough. There is a tram that goes from Monte Carlo to the Bellagio which is great. It makes it a lot easier getting down the strip without having to walk so much. The tram comes every two minutes, so you don't have to wait long. Look at the sign when you walk up to the tram to know which side of the tracks you need to be on to get the next tram. One day I laid out by the pools. This is probably the best thing about Monte Carlo. There are four pools. One is a regular pool, one looks like it might be a kiddie pool, one is a wave pool and one is a lazy river. It was kept very clean and I loved the whole area. There was music playing in the background. It wasn't overwhelming loud, but it was pop music. I would suggest sitting close to the pool bar, so you don't have to walk so far to get a drink. You can't get into the pool area unless you show your room card which is nice. I don't think I would stay at this hotel again unless I was coming down with kids so they could play in the pools. I will probably look elsewhere just because of the coffee not in the rooms and the fact that shower didn't drain.

I'm beginning to think people expect WAY too much in this day and age and I'm only 32!!! From all the reviews I was a bit nervous to stay at this hotel, but as it was comped (our first for Vegas!) I didn't want to lose the opportunity to stay in a property we've never even stepped foot in. This hotel has become my new favorite place to stay. Even if I never receive another comp offer again, I would still pay to stay at the MC. From reading a few trip advisor trip reports on the message boards, I was left with the impression that the walking/travel time between City Center and MC was a bit of a treck. To my surprise, the walk to the tram, which took us to Bellagio, was not even a 5 min walk. And the walk from MC to Aria was even less. It was literally a hop, skip and a jump away from the end of the Street of Dreams. Once inside the Aria, you could simply cross straight over to the lobby area and enter the Crystals mall. We were given a deluxe room on the 26th floor, room 324. I honestly believe I had a better \"strip\" view than the strip views would give. We could see the \"backside\" of the NYNY and the coaster (which never could be heard), the Excalibur, the Luxor, the Mandalay Bay and The Hotel. At night, we had a lit up \"strip\" view to the left with a gorgeous city and mtn view in from of us. Our room overlooked the main entrance to the MC hotel. The only complaint I would have was that the bathtub was clogged with a slow drain, however having been involved in a large festival just before arriving, my husband had been on his feet for most of the day and welcomed the soaking of his feet as he showered, so it wasn't an issue that bothered us enough to even call maintainence. The beds were comfy, the food court had a good selection of eatery's and the buffet was delicious. Being on a budget this trip, we chose not to eat at any of the more expensive restaurants, though the menus seemed to offer a large variety of dishes at decent prices. The pool area during the week was not crowded in the least. At noon we decided to head down to the lazy river and had no issues finding a seat. In fact there were a 3 chairs available right next to the women's restroom right in front of the lazy river and no one wanted them because they were shaded. By the time we had made several trip around the lazy river, the sun was shining bright on them and I was able to sunbathe and get dried off before heading back up to our room. My husband and I are not big gamblers in the least. Though we didn't hit any jackpots, we were able to put our money in the slots (all we played this trip) and it would last enough to keep us entertained for hours. I found it funny that during the day the slots seemed \"looser\" than in the evenings when there seemed to be more people in the casinos. Even the Aria paid us pretty good that we came back to the MC with more $ the we went in with, but then was quickly put right back. I don't go to Vegas with the expectations of winning big, just enough to keep me entertained, which was the case for us! All in all we had a wonderful relaxing time (which is all we expected out of our trip). I honestly believe that some people's expectations are so high that once they arrive to a hotel and their expectations are not met they immediately give the hotel a bad review.

The furniture was boring and the television was your typical Motel 6 RCA, the carpet was there and had the look of well-worn high-traffic commercial carpet. I'll usually stay at a Hampton Inn for business trips and their rooms are better appointed than the Monte Carlo. The \"Strip View\" is a joke. While you do have a strip view, our wing was set back behind the casino. Other than the big HRC guitar, and a sign that says \"ROSS - Coming Soon\" there was nothing to view on the strip. Obviously the windows don't open and that's a shame because we couldn't clean a spot in or to actually see out - they were filthy. The room itself was clean except for the moths - one dead, one alive. The rest of the hotel was fine. We arrived early (about 6 hours before normal checkin) and were still taken care of right away. There was no line at that time and the front desk staff was quick and courteous. One thing I really like is that the front desk area is not buried inside the casino. From the taxi dropoff to checkin to the elevators we never had to wheel our luggage through the casino. The elevators themselves are somewhat slow and lines had a habit of forming at the elevator banks but that can be expected on a weekend.

Though not opulent, the hotel decor is attractive and upscale for a value property. The elevator configuration makes room access a breeze. The room was adequate for our needs. While the decor was bland, the bedding and temperature was comfortable. The bathroom was of decent size and in good repair. The floor (21st) was quiet and very accommodating for sleep and rest. It was a solid, basic room. The casino appeals to those like myself who enjoy a comfortable, relaxed place to play with decent cocktail service on the floor. The drinks were weak but the waitresses were attentive. The sports book is intimate with enough ammenities to watch a game or a few races but I wouldn't stay beyond this. The seating was adequate but not plush. The pool area was good with excellent access and a lazy river feature. Arrive early if you want a selection of loungers. The only negatives I experienced was a small bit of trash in the room when I arrived but was attributed to someone who left a take-out lunch in their room after express checkout. There was a moth infestation in the room the three days we were there which was annoying. The television was an old, small tube instead of the updated flat screens popular in other properties. I usually don't watch TV in my room but did so for an NBA game one evening and would have enjoyed a better viewing experience.

I liked the casino (reasonably good paying slots etc. but of course they can and do change the odds in a heartbeat, depends on the day of the week, time of the year, time of day, etc. I haven't quite figured out the pattern, but I can tell when the odds are different). As for location, it is excellent, but remember, the distances even to a next door hotel are enormous. To reach the Bellagio is at least a 20 minute walk. But this is nevertheless a good strip location in a nice area. There is a Walgreen's as \"next door\" as anything in Las Vegas can actually be. The pool and exercise room are very nice.

As a flight attendant, I'm used to hotel rooms and this one was very average--basic beds, TV, desk and cleaning amenities. The location is ideal, although personally I find City Center to be an eyesore. The hotel is in the heart of everything, and within walking distance to a lot of what The Strip has to offer. There are a lot of restaurants and other great hotels (MGM Grand, NY NY) in close proximity. Several chain restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe, Denny's, McDonald's) are nearby as well, in addition to excellent specialty restaurants. The pool area is beautiful, although they play extremely loud music throughout the day, so if you enjoy napping, request a room that is not poolside. The lazy river was very crowded, as were the private cabana areas. There were always plenty of seats near each of the pools. The staff that we encountered was very helpful and friendly. The casino was fun, and seemed to have more penny slots than most of the other casinos on the Strip. We didn't win much of anything, but the video machines with the bonus games seemed to hit quite a bit and make what little we were spending last quite some time. I've stayed at the Sahara in the past, and as a budget traveler, the Monte Carlo is far superior.

I had always seen the Monte Carlo as I walked by, and others I know have stayed there and liked it, so I decided to give it a try. I had checked other hotels in the area, comparing their prices, and the rate I found for the Monte Carlo was pretty reasonable. I checked their website, and realized they charge a $12.95 plus tax mandatory Resort Fee (daily), but we went ahead and booked a room. This Resort Fee covers the cost of two 12-oz bottles of water (our first night we only had one on the desk), a newspaper, use of their fitness center and the business center that we weren't interested in using. Even though we stayed there for Saturday and Sunday nights, the price was still good for where we were located on 'The Strip'. To start, I had read the reviews on this site, and especially paid attention to the negative reviews. I took my chances, and this is what we experienced there: Upon entering the main lobby, we noticed there was no line, so we were checked in quickly. After getting to the room, and opening the door, we noticed trash strewn all over the room; a sheet pulled off of one of the beds; bath water still in the tub, with the shower curtain inside of the tub and more trash on the bathroom floor. I immediately became upset, and my boyfriend got on the phone to report what we found. He was put on hold; he waited for approximately 3 minutes, then hung up and we went back downstairs to tell them what we found and asked for another room. The girl behind the counter apologized and assigned us to a room on a higher floor with a nice view of the City Center buildings and the pools. I also asked her to make sure to report this to whomever she needed, so that we're not charged for the damages. The room is decorated okay and was very clean. Since we're experienced travelers, we were shocked to find out that the hotel charges $100 per day for the incidental fee; since we were there for two nights, they had to hold $200.... which we expect to get back within a few days. On our 2nd night there, around 3pm, after returning to the room after being out for 6 hours, the room had not been cleaned. I began assuming the hotel may have cutbacks on staff, so they don't get to many rooms until the afternoon hours. The housekeeper eventually showed up, and my boyfriend told her we needed clean towels, but he didn't say anything to her about taking out the trash and dirty towels. As for the furniture, it does look a little outdated, but it was decorated enough to not look too boring. The bed was okay, but the pillows were awful. I don't know if this is something that occurs daily, but the pool area closed between 5-6pm, which is strange, since this is Nevada and why close so early.... they should remain open until at least 9pm, in my opinion. The pools aren't too big, but they have a 'lazy river' and a wave pool for everyone to enjoy. I was able to sit in the pool area with a laptop and still received wireless internet access. Would I stay here again? Yes I would, if the price is right and due to its location, but I will for sure look for better places next time.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great pool\u201d", "Author": "BGK190479", "ReviewID": "UR63658794", "Content": "Great hotel at the Strip in Las Vegas.It is easy to get a cheap room if booking i advance.

After researching the Monte Carlo I thought it would be an excellent place to stay. I looked on line and saw a beautiful lobby, beautiful pool area and thought it would be perfect. I booked my trip and then started reading the reviews I have to say I was a little nervous and even contemplated upgrading to a more expensive hotel; let me tell you this hotel is perfectly fine to stay at. The hotel is in a perfect location across from MGM and New York New York, the pool area is berautiful with a swimming pool, wave pool, lazy river, food and beverage service outside is offered. The casino is not huge but by no means is it small it is a nice size casino; there are plenty of slots and tables available. They have a 24 hour cafe which is reasonably priced and the food (breakfast lunch dinner served at anytime) it is very good and you get nice size portions. Burger and Fries figure about $12.00. They have a 24 hour food court with McDonalds, Subway, Baskin Robbins, Sbarro and a Mexican fast food options as well. The rooms were just fine; nothing formal but not a Motel 6/Circus Circus either. Housekeeping was in everyday with clean towels and bottled water (which keep in mind all the hotels now charge $12.00 a day surcharge in addition to your room rate). This hotel by no means is the Bellagio or Venetian or Wynn, but you are also paying half the price. This is NOT a seedy, dirty hotel it was clean and offered not only the food court and cafe but also a buffet restaurant and an upscale French restaurant and Steak Restaurant and Diablos restaurant which is a fun indoor/outdoor Mexican/American restaurant. I would definitely stay here again; I would have no reason not to, there is food, nightlife gambling and pool. I am convinced that people can have a bad experience in any hotel, you could stay at the best hotel in the world and you would still find people who will complain; look at the complaints posted: the WIFI was not working the rooms were loud, for gosh sakes your on vacation, put the computer away and have fun. If you have been to Vegas then you know how much there is to do at night - by the time we went to bed we were so exhausted we never heard a peep, the hallways were quite. The chances of you being in your room the exact same time the people next to you are is slim; it's Vegas everyone is on a different schedule. The night life was lively, the food was good, the rooms were clean, the locations is PERFECT and the price is reasonable. Do not be afraid to stay at this hotel I would certainly recommend it. I have had numerous people also recommend this hotel to me and I am glad I stayed here. The only negative thing I have to say is if you use a players card at the tables (Black Jack, Let it Ride, Poker) you must bet at least $10.00 for points to register; big deal - players cards work in all the slots and you can still use your card at all the other qualifying hotels if you want to find a $5.00 table - Big deal right!!! Take it from a person who travels frequently and has been to Vegas numerous times.

However, the rooms: Black mold in shower, broken faucet, bed was broken, angled so badly you could see it. We asked to fix the sink, remove mold, and rectify the bed. We could not switch rooms, as they had none available at that time, however maybe later on possibly?? Well they came to fix the issues, however bed was still an issue (slept with head at the feet instead) sink broke within 3rd time of using again, and mold was not gone.

We were told this was because they needed space to get out in case of fire, however 2 of the days we were there, the room between the chairs was so narrow you could walk in many areas. They were more concerned how the chairs looked, and they had laid flat, then the customers. They would move a chair over if you had got up to get lunch, or swim, even with your items on it!

No one took responsibility for the fact that they were banging, and moving chairs 4 times in 1 afternoon while you are trying to enjoy the sun. Not so relaxing.

I could still hear the ambulances down below although I was on the 20th floor and at 5:50 am the engineers accidentally set off the hotel alarm and a loud voice came into our room \"May I have your attention, please\" and then it shut off.

The good news is City Center is mostly finished, Monte Carlo has been lightly remodeled and maybe best of all, the parking garage is back! A quick comment about Aria @ City Center, we were not impressed. To me it felt like a gigantic version of Red Rock or GVR? Not a bad thing, but not on par with Bellagio, Wynn, etc... Room - We stayed in a Monaco Suite. Good size,space and layout. The walls are thin but it never was a problem. Most newer properties have separate tub and shower, not here, jucuzzi tub/shower combined, there was a separate 1/2 bath. The room was available when we arrived (12:15) and was clean. Gaming - Played the slots, not much success, not the worst either. Blackjack was a pleasant suprise, 3/2 without continuous shuffle, $10 tables, even a few $5's. Craps was active, up to 5X and had a few good rolls myself. Dining - The cafe was very good. We had lunch and thought the food was well above average and service good as well. We tried dinner at Brand steakhouse and were impressed. We thought the menu had good variety and we liked the \"open to the casino\" aspect of the place.

He had booked a deluxe room but paid extra for a high floor with a strip view. Check in was fairly quick and easy. Went up to check out the room and of course we didn't get the upgrade we paid for. We did get a high room but over looking the parking lot and parking garage. We almost overlooked that to stay in the room but upon further inspection, the room was a dump! Torn and frayed carpet where the carpet met the tile, beds that looked very well worn to the point you could see a visible cave in the middle of the mattress. The icing on the cake was the cigarette burn hole in one bed spread and some red stain (blood? Red lipstick?) on the other bedspread. My husband went back down and refused the room and asked for an upgrade (but paid out of our pocket for that because he didn't say anything about the stains) We were hoping to get a room that was less used and abused. We ended up with a huge suite which was much better but still quite worn out. Carpet was worn and stained in spots, ink doodling on the upholstered wing chair, mildew in the shower caulking. But our housekeeping crew did a very nice job of cleaning each day! The Monte Carlo staff was very nice and professional. We did swim one day when it was warm. The lazy river is nice but can get crowded. Maybe because the wave pool wasn't open yet so everyone was in the river pool. Another pool was open but in the shade so it was a little cold. But the area seemed clean and well kept. Food court was good but over priced as typical for Vegas. But it was well staffed and busy times moved quickly. Oh and the Pub had really, really good burgers!! So I would say that if you are going to Vegas to be OUT of your room most of the time and don't really care what it looks like, the standard deluxe room at the Monte Carlo should be fine for that. But if you don't like unidentifiable stains on your bedding and carpet, go for an upgrade or another hotel.

In planning the wedding, we looked at a variety of hotels and found that the Monte Carlo was not only willing to work with the bride on every aspect of her reception, we were also able to negotiate group rates for all the wedding guests who stayed at the hotel. I shared a room with another friend who was traveling solo. The room was fairly basic; two beds, a tv, a desk, a bathroom... the view was great though. We were high up in one of the towers, strip side, so the view was difficult to beat. The fact that the room was basic wasn't an issue; we weren't in Vegas to stay in the room all day. Since we were in town during the middle of March, there was an inevitable \"spring break\" feel, most noticeably at the pool. However, it was far less than some of the other places we visited (Planet Hollywood, Tropicana, Excalibur, to name a few). The staff worked hard to make sure the place felt clean, despite so many people. There was a great variety of food in the hotel, including a food court, a buffet, and several restaurants of varying food and price. I went to the buffet for breakfast one day; the price for breakfast was around $20 and there was a large amount of food to choose from. Everything I had was pretty good (though I'm told that the breakfast buffet food was much better than the dinner buffet), and it was not difficult to find enough to eat. The other restaurant I tried was Diablo's Cantina at the front of the hotel. The atmosphere was fun, but the food was barely passable. I actually preferred the food at Rubio's in the food court to the food at Diablo's. The location of the hotel is great. It is within walking distance of a good deal of the south part of the strip, including New York New York, the MGM Grand, Tropicana, Excalibur and the Luxor. To the north, there is a free tram that runs from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio, with a stop in between. And, in case of emergencies, there is a CVS Pharmacy about 100 feet from the front entrance. The staff at the Monte Carlo was great; the event staff in particular was fantastic. As previously mentioned, they worked tirelessly with the bride, the hotel coordinator and myself to take care of every detail we could think of. The day-of staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The bartender, Doug, was extremely engaging and had some great stories. And when we realized that the cake topper was too heavy for the cake, had fallen over and cracked the cake, the baker/decorator rushed in and managed a beautiful repair job, all before most of the guests had arrived! In addition to the great service, the food was excellent. Overall, it was a great trip. The guests that I talked to all had very favorable things to say about the hotel and the service.

I was so stoked. I had always seen this hotel on previous visits and wanted to stay here. We checked in and it started off wrong. I had called and spoken to a rep on the phone who said I could upgrade to a spa suite and it would be reserved; I just has to pay for it when I checked in. No problem!!! We arrived at the hotel on a Sunday night, after the NASCAR event was all said and done. The lobby was beautiful. I got up to the counter and the check in clerk had no notes and no upgraded room in my reservation. To top it off, I would not be able to get the spa suite until Tuesday night, our last night there. I decided at that point not to upgrade. I did not want to have to change rooms and be on someone else's time schedule. No apology or anything. Supposedly, the only smoking room left was a handicap room. Fine. I was already ticked I did not have my upgrade. We get up to the room, walk in, and the room had not been even made up!!! Bedding tossed on a chair, pillows on the floor, and the bathroom was a mess! My hubby called the front desk and asked for a manager - he was immediately transferred to housekeeping. (He is much more patient and nicer than me) They would be up immediately to fix it. Ok. We sit at the desk for a half hour waiting; finally about 8 pm my husband called again and spoke to Jake, a manager. Jake moved us immediately to a room down the way (smoking even, funny!?!) and noticed we were there for three nights. He said that as a courtesy, he would comp us 50.00 in room service each night for the problem. We get to the new room and it was all setup for an arrival. Great! We ordered room service the following am after exploring the strip a bit, and no issues. The next day, I call again for some breakfast. I then get a call from in-room dining, that the credit was a one time deal and the needed to know how I would be paying for the items. I was again, not happy. I informed the agent that Jake was the one who set this up. She said she would contact the management and speak to him to get the ok. Another call back to my room and I was told the credit was a one time deal, and since Jake was off, they would not be able to honor the credit. I was done arguing. That was the last strike. We completed our stay and now know we should have gone with another property. My husband agreed.

Well needless to say he was impressed, from the check in process to the first glimpse of our spa suite, he was in awe. The spa suite was beautiful, a romantic room to reconnect with your special person. A wet bar with a fridge, a steam shower, a surround sound, and the beautiful spa tub with a gorgeous view of the mountains. The King size bed was sooo comfortable with deluxe linens. Oh what luxury!! The housekeeping staff was beyond compare with one night turn down service and chocolates on our pillow. Water bottles daily. They just anticipated our every need. We ate at the buffet every day for supper and breakfast. The food was fantastic, fresh and the made to order stations (omelates, pasta, stirfrys) were my husbands favorites, cracked crab, shrimp and other seafood, prime rib, chicken ham, mexican, chinese and desserts to die for. Champagne brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. With all of the selections you would think that they would slip somewhere, but the attention to detail was visisble, with trays refilled, items not being allowed to dry out, very impressive.The cafe was so nice for a late night snack with the sandwhiches so big you couldn't wrap your hands around them. We did not try Brands as we did not want to make a reservation because we did not want to be tied to a time, but it was busy and people looked like they were enjoying themselves. Might try it on a later trip. The new Aria is connected via an indoor walkthrough where you don't even realize that you have left the Monte Carlo property. The Aria casino was quite pricey with high denomination machines. Was hard to find something affordable to play there. The Monte Carlo casino has alot of machines, too many penny machines though and the tables start at a minimum $10 a hand. I think that they could lower this for the day time crowd. But we did have some luck at the Monte Carlo, didn't lose our shirts there like we did at the Aria. MGM casino was very lucky, as was some of the properties on Freemont street. There is a free tram that now runs to the Bellagio which saved some wear and tear on my walking shoes. Its location is great because you can access other properties and site seeing venues, plus the shops. We took the duece bus to freemont and it stops right in front of the hotel. Saw Zumantiy, shopped till I dropped and ate like kings. The only real drawback was the pool was closed for the season, can understand that though because the temps were never above 60. The Monte Carlos service, hospitality and suites are terrific, I would not hesitate to refer friends or family. Our Casino Host, Chaz is beyond compare. He is knowledgeable, helpful and so patient with questions and offers suggestions that he would anticipate we would like. We are a modest couple but were treated like \"high rollers\".

We said we didn't plan on charging anything and refused to give the card. She kept pushing for our card and we kept denying them. Finally, she stated she needed it for the resort fees. It was obvious that she was trained not to disclose this fee. When we showed our receipt stating that all taxes and fees were already paid, she still wanted us to pay the resort fee. Finally, she got a supervisor and the fee was waived. He showed us how if we clicked like 5 buttons on the hotel website there was an asterik on the bottom of page 5 stating there could be resort fees added. Trickery and deception!!! Stand firm- refuse to pay this extortion fee!! Also, there is not one spot to go outside and enjoy the sun or a book. Not only is the pool closed and under repair, there is not one spot to get some fresh air unless you head to the strip and sit on a bench there. I would never stay here if you like privacy and sun while swimming. When the pool does open, it is over shadowed by the City Center. Looming over the pool area is the tram to the City Center, so be prepared to have the public watch you. You will also have a view of the massive building all around you. It is a shame how the Monte Carlo is ruined by the city center. The view is ruined from the rooms by the behemoth City Center. If you just want a good location without wanting to be outside or being overshadowed by the City Center doesn't bother you- this could be a place for you. The Cafe was delicious and accomodating.

Vegas is a ZOO on New Year's Eve, I cannot recommend that to any one (unless you are a glutton for punishment, or just want to be squeezed in with 2 million of your closest friends ~ seriously...). That being said, the week is on of Vegas' busiest of the year. While Monte Carlo was full, they handled the crowds efficiently. Have stayed with Monte Carlo three times in the last year, and will consider it as first choice in future. Rooms were comfortable, we had two regular rooms (double queen beds) and one \"Monaco\" Junior Suite. The regular rooms are comfortable, well appointed, but a little too dark for my liking. Would it be too much to ask for more lights? For a few dollars more, the Monaco suite is well worth the price: Marble entries and marble baths (yes, two bathrooms), sitting area, refrigerator, double sinks in the master, over 700sq ft. Twice we've stayed in a Monaco, and each time it was LESS THAN $100 per night! Check in was not bad, it varies by time of day. Once I arrived before noon, and the room was not ready (check-in is 3:00, after all, but Vegas is a 24-hour city, and other places I've stayed could accommodate early arrival). Arriving mid-afternoon will find longer lines, but they move quickly and the staff anticipates the crowd. In December we arrived around Midnight and the check-in was fast, courteous, and amazingly alert given the time of day. It galls me to pay $15 / night for Internet, but what are you going to do? That is pretty standard on the Strip right now. Monte Carlo offers BOTH wireless and wired (your choice) in the room, fee is charged to your bill only if you accept and sign up each day. One time, higher floor, wireless was intermittent and not satisfactory so we opted for wired.This time, wireless was strong (lower floor) and quite convenient. Check before you sign up, but you can change back and forth each day. Since the summer (of 2009) they have added a $9.95 daily \"resort fee,\" which ostensibly is to pay for two bottles of water (wow! that's pricey water!), a daily newspaper (which was free before they charged daily) and full access to the fitness club. That is worth it if you are going to work out, as they used to charge more than $10 per day to use the fitness facilities. In reality, it is simply a way of charging another $10 while making it APPEAR as though the daily rate is lower. This seems to be pretty consistent for ALL of the MGM/Mirage properties now, and has been copied by other brands, as well. Food is surprisingly good. The \"Cafe\" looks at first like a simple restaurant, but the menu is EXTENSIVE and the pricing reasonable. Some of their salads became my wife's favorite, and she regularly wanted to eat there. The buffet is about like any of the buffets on the Strip, except on Sunday Morning they have a champagne brunch which is definitely a step up. \"Brand\" steakhouse is fine, but undistinguished from other steakhouses in Vegas. Brand often runs specials, like the pre-show prime rib, which is very nice. Only Diablo's Mexican Cantina came as a real disappointment ~ nothing special, prices high, and indigestion to follow. As others have mentioned, there is a full food court, too, with quick grab McDonald's, Haagen Dasz, Subway, pizza, and others. A second, larger/nicer Starbuck's has opened in the passageway to City center (just past the Pub), as well as a cupcake-ery. In December, Monte Carlo opened an interior connector to City Center. You can now walk from Monte to Aria without setting foot outside (though I felt, with all of the halls and escalators, a little like a gerbil in a Habitrail!). You can also access indoors a tram that goes to Crystal's shopping and all the way to Bellagio all for FREE which makes the location extremely convenient to the west side of the Strip. Of course, across the street (small access road, not the Strip) is NewYork-NewYork and its attractions, and accross the Strip (cross with the lights!) is shopping, OutBack steaks, and more. There are CVS and Wallgreens right by MonteCarlo, as well. Right in the hotel is the Lance Burton theater. Since Burton and Monte Carlo re-signed last Fall, that provides a good in-house show most nights. Equally imprtant, six nights each week Frank Caliendo appears in the same theater. He also stays around for you to meet, greet, and have your picture taken. A riot and well worth seeing. Since City Center opened they have re-opened the public self-park garage which is free and convenient. However, there is also free parking out front and across the access drive which we used often and found even more convenient. Valet parking is fast, courteous, and free (tip, as always in Vegas!)

I read that there was a resort fee to use the pool(which was closed when we were there because it was too cold), 2 bottles of water per day,(that we only got 2 out of the 4 days we were there), free local calls(who are we going to call locally?), get a paper daily(again, we got that only 2 out of the 4 days) and use of the gym. That was $9.50 PER NITE!!!!! Only recently did I hear an informational program that said to avoid places w/RESORT FEES. I figured we would get there and say, we aren't going to call anyone, use the gym, drink the bottled water and we COULDN'T use the pool, so they would take the fee off. NOPE, didn't happen. So we get into our room, which had a wonderful view of the BACK of the hotel, when we asked for a view of the strip, that's what we got. Then, as I was standing by the window, looking at our wonderful view of ...traffic, I was stepping on something. Here, there were a bunch of crushed crackers that hadn't been vacuumed up! GROSS!!! And, as I looked around the room, our ironing board was missing. I made sure to report both right away, cuz I didn't feel like paying $400 for an ironing board, which I'm sure I would have been held responsible for. There was a burn mark in the bathroom floor from a cigarette or something. And the comforter on the bed was disgusting. Very old and 'pilly.' The whole room could have used a makeover, very musty. Almost every hotel we've ever stayed at on vacation, even the inexpensive ones, have refrigerators and microwaves in the rooms. Not here. And don't even THINK about staying in the room to relax and watch tv. There are about 15 channels, maybe, and 3 of them are informational channels about the hotel. And everytime we would turn the tv on, the volume was soo loud. So I had to turn the tv on and quick mute it so I could turn the volume down. I liked the food court, but that too needed a desperate make-over. There were chips out of the walls where the tables hit the wall. And the tables were worn down a couple of layers in spots.

Itch like crazy and in \"clusters\" on different parts of my body look more like welts.

(This is a late submission). I've stayed here before, and the construction was still going on, but it was expected, so again, not too much of an issue. The room was good, the value was good. What I haven't done in Vegas before was chill by the pool. ( When hubby and I go to Vegas, we're usually tied up with shopping and sightseeing) We spent our days by the pool, and our nights partying at the clubs. What a great vacation. The sun sits right in the middle of the sky and when you get too warm the lazy river cools you off just right. Let me just say the DJ and his/her mash-ups were either awesome or horrible. But the thumping of the music and crowd of people to watch... it was perfect. I didn't notice before, but there is an awfully strong floral smell emitted into the hotel that I found this time to be nauseating. In fact, my leather jacket (which stayed in my suitcase for the duration of the trip) reeked of it for weeks after. As always, the service is fine (not outstanding but not bad), the decor and cleanliness are fine. We had a poolside room which I guess if you are spending the days in your room might be an issue- the music carried up to the 27th floor and rocked our walls- but we were cool with it. (After laying by the pool all day we had to have a nap to make sure we were in shape for the night's festivities! It's a tough life!) Tip- try Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville for an inexpensive, entertaining dinner. Or another favorite? Gonzales Y Gonzales in New York New York! That place never fails to satisfy a craving for southwestern cusine- and, you can get the mile high margaritas there too!! Another great place for dinner- The Voodoo Restaurant. Expensive and classy with awesome service and cool decor. Afterwards, head up to the VooDoo Lounge for some drinks and enjoy the view on the rooftop patio. Be advised, after 10 pm, tables are reserved for bottle service only, but with the DJ and crowd out on the patio, who wants to be sitting at a table? It's one of my favorite nightspots! The Monte Carlo isn't the Wynn, or Caesars. It's average accomodation with a great location on the strip. It's nothing extremely fancy, and is not at all a dive-joint.

However the new buildings cast a shadow over the pool area for a large part of the day, so if lazing by the pool is your thing you may want to go elsewhere. I had a problem with the safe in my room. This was quicky fixed by the friendly security staff. The rooms do need some modernisation but are clean and have everything you need. The hotel is not themed so it does not attract large amounts of gawping tourists, just guests and gamblers. The buffet is ok, but the close by MGM Grand is better. The hotel also includes a food court, with Starbucks, Macdonalds, Subway and a few others. The hotel is in a good position on the strip. Don't buy food or drink from the hotel shop, pop outside to the CVS Pharmacy or Walgreens and you will save loads. The MGM Grand across the road will give you access to the Monorail, but if there are a few of you, it may be cheaper and quicker to get a taxi.

We normally have had great luck with the Monte Carlo, but this trip might be our last stay. It all started at check in. The still have people getting into a variety of lines to get to the front desk. Instead of one line and you get the next available person, you get into a line and hope you pick the right one. I, of course, did not. I watched as people who came in after me go to the front desk staff while I stood and stood. I only had 3 single people in front of me, but of course, as they got the desk, 2 \u2013 4 others joined them. So after a 20 minute wait, I was finally at the front desk. I booked this trip over 6 months ago asking for connecting rooms, one with a king, one with two queens. Of course, they could not do this. I had options of a king in a handicap room on a different floor from the 2nd room or two rooms that were both queens in various sections of the same floor. After some work, they were finally able to get us two rooms, both queens, close to one another. You would think with today\u2019s technology, the planning for rooms would not be this difficult. So after 30 minutes, we were finally up to our room. The rooms were okay. I remember the Monte Carlo having nicer rooms, but I guess they are just getting old. What was really disappointed is the condition of the room from the cleaning staff. All the beds looked like, after they were made, someone laid in the middle of the beds. The comforters were wrinkled and in one case, the pillows were on the bed, not under the comforter. So we spent the first part of our visit looking the room over to ensure it had actually been cleaned. The first evening and day was nice. The casino was clean, getting around was easy and the staff at the hotel were courteous. They cleaned our rooms as expected and the room seemed to be in good shape, until we went to bed. In one of the room, the sheets did not fit either queen bed. It was like some camping trip where you got your bed short sheeted. We tried to strip and remake the beds, but it did not matter. The sheets were not the right size. So we slept on part sheet, part mattress. The final insult were the surveys I was asked to fill out.

The hotel is located between the city center (which is currently under construction) and New York, New York. There are many restaurants, nightclubs and shopping within walking distance. Our room was on the 18th floor and had an awesome view of the pool and new City Center. The room was well kept, clean and had everything we needed (there is hair dryer and iron/board in room). All that really matters is that you have a bed - you are in vegas!! if you want a nice quiet place - stay home!! The staff at the Monte Carlo are awesome! Anything you need (extra towels, water, matches... etc.) they have it to you in no time and with a smile. They even took 2 long distance phone calls off our bill because I didn't get through ($15 per call - buy a phone card!!) check - in and check out was a breeze. The only thing i didn't like was the $9.50 per day resort fee. It included bottles of water in the room daily and printing of boarding passes. I have been to vegas a few times before, but my father and brother never have, so we rented a car and I took them to the Hoover Dam. We stopped at a few of the older historic casinos and hotels on the way. Make sure you eat or pack a lunch before you get to the Hoover Dam. We paid $45.00 for 3 burgers & fries there!! The casino at the monte wasnt too crowded most of the time, which is nice not to have to wait for a table or machine. We did win a little ( enough to pay for 3 tickets for 2 shows, and most of our meals) which was a bonus. Jubilee (at Bally's)- seen it 3 times now. Fantastic cabaret style show. Definately worth it. Ask cab drivers for coupon books - we got the $92.50 seats for $35.00!! We wanted tickets for the Beatles Love but it was sold out, so we saw Human Nature by Smokey Robinson at the Imperial Palace. Great show, very lively. Anyhow, I've stayed at many of the big properties in vegas, like the MGM Grand, Paris, etc., and the Monte Carlo is definately a great place to stay, we will go back for sure.

I do admit the walls are kind of thin, you can hear people talking and doors shutting but its ok, it won't keep you up because the beds are amazing.

On checkin we were given a smoking room with two Queen size beds and neither myself or my partner smoke, the room was tainted by the smell of cigarettes and wasn't ideal. I called the front desk and they moved us to a non smoking floor immediately. Our second room albeit slightly better had two Queen size beds again which to be frank is useless to a couple and takes up a lot of the floor space. I called the front desk and asked to be moved again to a room with a single King size bed. The front desk told me they couldn't do this for the first evening but were able to the next day. Finally, the next day we got a room that was ideal, a king size bed, and plenty of floor space for luggage, shopping etc. Throughout the experience I do have to say the front desk were accommodating and helpful at every turn. As for the remainder, the Pub has had a makeover and the Beer Towers have gone which is a bit of a bind as they made the old micro brewery worth a visit. I didn't use the pools but did go out there a couple of times, unfortunately you don't get much sun late on in the afternoon as the new building adjacent do their best to block out the sunlight. The Casino itself was ok, free craps lessons every day at 11. Occasional $5 blackjack tables for those gambling on a budget but I have to give special mention to Gail, one of the blackjack dealers. Her friendly demeanor really made playing at the table a pleasure, she introduced us to several people from all over the world and the table had a great atmosphere. There's also a Starbucks at the back of the Casino for those in need of a morning coffee, one thing I would say is the queues here get pretty big and you may have a wait so if you need a fix it might be quicker to go to NYNY next door. All in all, the location is on strip and pretty good but not central, the cleanliness and service are as you would expect from any hotel.

The location on the strip is great..not too overly busy, like places right in the middle of the strip but also not far away either to all the interesting places to visit.This hotel has plenty of staff for checking in and out so theres not alot of waiting around. We had an 8th floor room,.. not much for a view on the backside but you can get a partial glimpse of the pool(s) below. Very spacious room, low lighting and thick heavy covers on the bed. good sized bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries. One drawback is that they want to charge for WiFi service, which we believe is just ridiculous because there are much cheaper hotels across the country and places that give you this service for free anymore. They also need to install stationary or ceiling fans in the rooms as the window can only be opened a couple of inches and the room was stuffy in the morning. good bathroom with plenty of towels and guest toiletries. Housekeeping was very good, even in the latter part of the day, as you can find someone in the hallway if you need anything. The Casino itself was very nice and is wide open with alot of games. we found, compared to many other casinos on the Strip, that this one was much more open for foot traffic and had plenty of elbow room without feeling overly crowded, which was nice. We found the waitresses were very slow in bringing drinks unless you tipped heavy and heard that complaint from other people as well during our stay but outside of that, the casino itself is very well layed out. Their is a McDonalds, a Subway and another fastfood business in the hotel adjacent to the casino for quick bites. The breakfast buffet is actually pretty good for the price and the main selling point here, is the made to order omelettes...they also have a great variety of fruits and fresh baked goods to go along with a typical breakfast buffet tho we didnt see any toast but they had biscuits. I wouldnt recommend the lunch or dinner buffets here for the price, as there are so many buffets along the strip that offer more variety at the same price range but thats my personal observation. We did experience Diablos Cantina, which is a pub belonging to the hotel and casino..here you can sit outside on a patio setting and enjoy a cocktail, listen to music and people watch right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Monte Carlo. The chicken nachos are fantastic and a house favorite but be prepared to be full.. our waitress gave us a good tip and recommended getting only one order because the serving size is so large, it will feed four easily.. we tried our best and maybe finished a third of it and they are sooo good. The pool(s) area is quite popular and the Lazy River located here is just what it sounds like.. you can rent a floaty, grab a cocktail from the poolside bar and float around on the slow moving river all day if you want. its depth is only three feet or so but it will move you. some may want to come early to sunbathe as the lounge chairs fill up pretty fast after high noon when the sun comes around the building to shine on the pool area. Overall this hotel and casino has good points and bad too but it ranks up there with many of the leading places in Las Vegas and the architecture is amazing in itself for picture taking. There are good pictures of this property online.The staff, both in the hotel and casino are very helpful and super courteous to everyone, answering questions or giving advise to those that need it, whether a guest or just visiting. Be prepared to spend alot more for small items you might need from vendors inside as they are quite pricey unless you hit the jackpot or just have money to burn. we found for simple items that wont break your budget, you can walk a couple hundred yards nearby the property to a local CVS or Walgreens store and use the savings in the casino or for whatever.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cAbout the worst experience I ever had\u201d", "Author": "FloridaGemini20", "ReviewID": "UR46800045", "Content": "The only good thing about this hotel was the quiet room.

Cleaning left a bit to be desired, for example when the cleaner couldn't reach a corner of the bed to put the duvet flat it was left. This may be due to the huge volume of rooms they have to clean and there isn't the time to make the finishing touches.

I'd read a few bad reports of this hotel, so I was a little aprehensive about my stay, however, given it was a comp deal, I went ahead with my stay....and I'm glad I did....The Monte Carlo Hotel is a pretty nice hotel and not deserving of some of the bad reviews I have seen posted. As a solo female traveller I can say I felt totally safe and comfortable at the MC. Check in was swift and friendly. I was given room 20318 which faced the mountains....with the Orleans seen in the distance straight ahead and the NYNY to my left. The room....as with the hallways was decorated in beige. The carpets could do with a freshen up but the bed was very comfortable, the linens were crisp and not at all scratchy, the towels in the bathroom were brand new and fluffy white. The room is furnished with \"cherry wood\"...it is looking a tad outdated for my taste, however, the desk wardrobe and amoir were all in excellent condition. The room was very clean and comfortable over all. The 1st night I heard no noise at all...and I wondered where the reviews of paper thin walls come from. I found out on the second day when I had 2 ladies move into the room next door who were LOUD....very loud...I could hear every word of their conversation! I had a room with an interconnecting door though....so that might be to be avoided. The casino downstairs has a wonderfully staffed, friendly poker room. The slot machines varied from pennies up and the cocktail service was super speedy sometimes and deathly slow at others, depending on which section you sit in. There is a food court with a starbucks and subway, maccas, sbaro, ice creams and some chinese food and mexican food. The location of MC is slap bang next to NYNY on one side and the city center project on the other. I did not hear any construction noise at all. The pool area has 2 pools and a lazy river. Well staffed and very clean. Room service is amongst the worst I have eaten anywhere....this is to be avoided....I ordered twice just to make sure I didnt just cop a bad night....and the 2nd time was equally as bad as the 1st.....give room service a miss. Over all though....I consider the Monte Carlo a pretty good 3 star hotel. It may not have the glitz and glamour of other big players in the Vegas Hotel game, but it also doesnt have the high rates. It's a solid mid teir property with friendly staff, good location and pretty good bang for your buck. Would I stay there again? Yes. Would I suggest friends stay there? Yes....for a rate of under $100 a night....it's a pretty good deal.....anything over $100, there are better deals to be had in Vegas. Oh...ps...They have introduced a \"resort fee\", which I think is rubbish....it's $9.50 a night (I think)...I wrote \"declined\" under where it says resort fee on my check in slip.

I got a good deal on Hotwire. Although built in 1993, the Monte Carlo has been well-maintained over the years and was in good shape. Hallways, lobby, elevators, and room all have a consistent design scheme and look good. The room was well-designed, attractive, and in good condition, with no funny smells or damage, except for a small tan stain on one of the comforters. The room was quiet and I got a good night's sleep. Room A/C was quiet and maintained temperature well. Parking is free, there is a lot of it, and the garage is relatively new and looks a lot nicer than some of the garages attached to older hotels on the Strip. Landscaping is not as elaborate as the Bellagio but is decent and reasonably attractive. Plus they have \"free\" newspapers (well, considering how much this place costs, they should be handing out newspapers). And of course, it's on the Strip and conveniently located next to a CVS/pharmacy open 24/7. There are some downsides, though, which is why I can't give it a rating of five. As a lot of people have noted, there's no fridge in the rooms. The room lighting was kind of dim and inadequate (only two lamps). There's an annoying $9 daily resort fee (which with taxes comes to $10.50 a day). The Monte Carlo uses the same gigantic garage for valet parking, self parking, and employee parking for both itself and the adjacent CityCenter complex, so the garage has a very confusing design intended to keep all four user populations separate, and the signage is not clear, which means it's easy to end up going the wrong way. The pool area is too small and in the shade of the Monte Carlo building itself for much of the day, which means the pools are rather cold and the surrounding chairs are overcrowded. The music in the pool area was not as loud as I expected but I agree that it is annoying. In the end, I appreciated the convenience of staying in a pleasant, clean, comfortable, quiet hotel room on the Strip with a good view of the city.

Something to keep in mind - there is a $9.50 / day charge if you want to use the gym. You do enough walking in Vegas so you probably don't need to bother with the gym! Our check-in took so long that we were given comps to the buffet which could be used at any time during our stay. The buffet was great - lots of selection and friendly staff. The pool was ok. It had an awful sewage smell the entire trip and the \"lazy river\" wasn't as fantastic as described. If you want to rent an inner tube for the lazy river for $12, you are better off going next door to the CVS pharmacy and buying a tube for $4. The room was decent enough but there is NO COFFEE MAKER (which was a must-have for me). There is a food court in the hotel which had a pretty decent selection. Another tip - if you don't want to be woken up by housekeeping at 9 a.m., remember to put your \"do not disturb\" sign on your door. We ate at Diablo's (hotel restaurant) one night.

I have never really been one to complain, but this is ridiculous for a casino/hotel that advertises such great rooms and service. We actually took pictures of the pubic hair and the cigarette burns/blood stains on the comforters. We intend to forward these to Monte Carlo Management. I would not even walk inside the room without shoes on.. For the same money I paid, I could have stayed at a better quality-controlled casino/hotel.

It was not a relaxing scene, more of a Spring Break feel. There is only one main pool and it was so crowded that we could not even find a chair--we would have had to sit on the cement. The pool guy recommended we walk two hotels down to Excalibur and use their pool, which we did. Their pool was fantastic-had an adults only section, 3-4 pools and tons of chairs. What was I paying Monte Carlo for if I had to walk 25 minutes down the Strip to use someone else\u2019s pool? The worst aspect of the hotel is the food. The restaurants are TERRIBLE!!! We spent our last evening at the hotel's steak restaurant, Brand, which is pretty pricey. Our entire meal tasted as if it was smoked, even the asparagus. All dishes, including salads, are made for two. What in the world does that accomplish? My husband and I wanted to order different sides and I wanted a salad as a first course.

I would compare rooms to the Best Westerns in Canada. Our rooms were on the 15th floor not facing the strip or the pool. The rooms were quiet, clean and plenty of space for the amount of time you are there. Check in was a breeze arrived at hotel at 1230, lunch time, and our rooms were ready, which was fantastic because check in time isn't until 3. Also check out time is at 11 am and our flight home didn't leave until 1130 pm, so they offered us our room at 1/2 of the days rate, so we could keep our room until 8pm. We had great service from the front desk, conceirge desk, (who helped us book a few day trips and also to let us know how to get cheaper tickets to some of the shows). I can't say we had any trouble or rudeness from one person who worked at the hotel. We did eat at the buffet for the champagne brunch, and it was worth every penny, we had our fair share of champagne to celebrate. We also ate at the buffet at the Mirage and I found we all enjoyed the buffet at the monte carlo the most, and the mirage was more expensive. One thing we did really like about this hotel is that it is smaller than some so it made it much easier to get around. We did two shows Lion King and Love would recommend both shows but are two totally different types of shows we also went to the gun shop on tropicanna ave and there you can do target practice a few other place we visit and would reccomend are shark reef, minus 5 bar, roller coaster at new york, rides at stratosphere also go to freemont st. at night places to eat roxy's, harley davidison cafe, italian place at new york.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay - will definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "JudyJackpot", "ReviewID": "UR39682300", "Content": "I don\u2019t know why some Las Vegas hotels avoid using any kind of organized line management system for the check in process, and the Monte Carlo is one of them. It seems that you have to jockey for a position in front of the check in desk, and pray that the clerks are efficient or that the people ahead of you don\u2019t have credit card issues. I hate that they don\u2019t use the \u201cnext in line\u201d approach by setting up the customary velvet ropes to guide guests through the line in an orderly manner. That said however, our stay at the Monte Carlo was GREAT once we got to our room. The rooms are nicely updated, clean and comfortable, the bathroom is super-clean with great amenities, and the hotel atmosphere is very nice. Housekeeping was excellent and the hotel towels were plush. The only downside to the room was the thin walls but this is common in most hotels and would have gone unnoticed except that the couple in the room next to us was rowdy and obnoxious - the lady had a loud, irritating laugh - but I chalk that up to inconsiderate human behavior and poor manners, and nothing against the hotel itself. Laughter is good, but not a 3:00 AM when some people are trying to sleep! Lucky for us they were gone the last two nights. We ate at the Monte Carlo buffet two times, for breakfast and then again for dinner but not on the same day. Both meals were excellent with a wide variety of fresh and tasty foods to choose from. Breakfast had traditional choices of eggs and bacon but also had pork chops and other meats although we could not seem to find any toast, and if you are an oatmeal eater like me, the raisins were located at the salad bar, and there was no brown sugar. The shrimp selection at dinnertime was fresh and the shrimp were large. The desserts were yummy as usual. The days of the cheap buffet are long gone in Las Vegas, but at Monte Carlo the best part about eating the buffet there was the relatively low price: breakfast was about $12 each and dinner was around $19 each. There is a food court which came in handy when my Starbucks craving hit, and for pizza from Sbarro as a late night snack after a long day of gambling. There is also a McDonalds and a couple of other fast food places, but we only ate at Starbucks and Sbarro. We chose to stay at the Monte Carlo for this Las Vegas trip because of the cheap price of only $59-$69 per night over Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights. We stayed there before but had been avoiding this hotel the past few years because of its proximity to the City Center major construction project, but it seems to be almost done. We had a room facing the strip and I never hear any noise coming from the construction \u2013 it was very quiet. There is also a brand new parking garage that is well lit, has wide spaces and one of the cleanest garages I have experience in Las Vegas. I actually saw a security guard walking the garage unlike other properties where they just rest up in the guard hut and view surveillance videos. And the bridge that takes you from the garage to the hotel drops you off at the lobby and close to the elevators so you don\u2019t have to valet park or schlep your luggage through the casino if you choose not to use bell service. High speed internet was $14.99 per 24-hours.

Got a very good deal through Expedia NZ, around NZD100/night with USD25 food and beverages allowance. We were given a room on the 31st floor, which is just one floor short of the top level. Ours faced the swimming pool (more about it later), but we couldn't hear any music, maybe because it's so high up. What we could hear almost all the time was the beeping noise of construction vehicles from next door. They almost finish building the Aria and Mandarin Oriental next door but there was still some construction noise. One reviewer noted that water drains very slowly on the bathtub which we also experienced. However the toilet flushed with a lot of vigor, the water felt like being sucked at high speed!! Safe is provided in the room, TV is still CRT (no flat screen?), air conditioning is very good, and no refrigerator. Location wise, it's pretty handy to New York New York and MGM, but a long walk on the crowded footpath to other places north. This is especially exacerbated by the construction next door which reduces the width of the footpath. At the end we drove everywhere, and since self-parking is free, it was much more easier and stress-free. One warning, don't drive on the Strip itself, especially northbound after 6pm. You'll get stuck for hours!! We used the back road which connected the hotels. The hotel itself looks amazing from the outside, but once you're past the reception, everything becomes ordinary. The casino doesn't have anything special, there isn't any shopping centre (shops, 'cept for the hotel's one), the only food place that was open for 24hrs is Subway. Compared with Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, New York New York, the Monte Carlo is far behind. Parking was handy, we could find a park just outside the main entrance, no need for valet or parking inside the car park building. The pools are very average, and full of people sitting/standing around with their cocktails getting slowly drunk. They would give you a dirty look for having fun, I guess the whole thing is being targeted to the adults market and not families! We went for a buffet breakfast at the hotel since we had the $25 allowance, lots of good food at the buffet.

Having traveled to Vegas twice in the past, I knew the layout of the Strip and knew that the Monte Carlo appeared both nice on the outside and nice in the lobby. We happened upon a great deal for a Monaco Suite at the hotel and booked it for 3 nights. A few days after booking, I noticed the reviews on this website and began to have second thoughts about staying at the resort. However, I decided to stay put and keep my reservation and wait until I checked in to make an opinion of the Monte Carlo for myself. The big day arrived and our flight arrived in Las Vegas early. Baggage claim was a breeze and we immediately chartered a Town Car at the airport to take us to the Monte Carlo. We arrived and proceeded to registration which was not very busy. I was pleased to see so many clerks working behind the desk and how clean the lobby was. We checked in immediately during which I asked where our room would be located, which was a low floor, and I asked to be placed higher. The clerk asked if floor 13 would be ok, to which I should have said no as that proved to be the omen for the resort. The room was on the pool side and I asked if there was anything else after having read the reviews on how loud the pool DJ can be. The clerk said no and that we would be moved to another room the next day facing the strip. Our room wasn't quite clean yet, which was no big deal as it was only 11 in the morning. We proceeded to the Forum Shops to have lunch at Spago and returned to the Monte Carlo around 1 p.m. We immediately made it to our room, which was conveniently located beside the elevators and opened the door. The sound of the pool music was much worse that I had anticipated. The view of City Center construction was awful as well. I was livid. I called the front desk to ask if I could be moved only to be told that there was nothing available. Having been told earlier that we would be moving the next day to another room I didn't want to unpack and sat down on the couch. That is when I noticed an unusual stain on the sofa that appeared to be a bodily fluid. At this point I was more livid. We left the hotel room, because it was so loud and began walking the strip to see what was going on. A couple hours prior to our dinner reservation, we returned to the hotel to change for dinner. Before boarding the elevator, we stopped by the registration desk to alert the staff of the bodily fluid and the pool music. They immediately moved us to a room facing the New York New York on a higher floor. However, when we walked up to the door, I noticed a room service tray sitting beside the door (Yes the other reviews of room service trays being left for days are in fact true). We opened the door and noticed lights on in the powder room, and ice bucket full of ice, an open bottle of water, and the adjoining room door open. Even more livid, we called the front desk and they moved us back down to the 12th floor back to the pool side. When we got to our room, the keys didn't work and a maintenance employee had to let us in. The furniture was tattered and looked as if it had seen better days. The Monaco Suite has potential. The rooms are spacious and having two bathrooms is a plus. However, t the Monte Carlo doesn't care to go the extra mile to reach that higher level. When we finally arrived in our final room we called to the front desk to alert them that we would only stay 1 night, as we had no time to change hotels before getting ready for dinner, and would check out in the morning. A manager asked what he could do to fix the problem, but never really offered much to keep us as customers. With over 3,000 hotel rooms, I know that the Monte Carlo had something better that they could have offered us, even if it meant paying more. They didn't offer to change our room type at all. The next day we checked out which was an easy process and checked into the Bellagio.

I am on their email list and booked directly thru their website when they emailed a good deal of 4 nights (including a Saturday) for approx $260 total.

Jody, who checked us in, and every other employee we encountered during our stay proved to be very friendly and customer service oriented. Our request for a king bed, non-smoking room was accommodated, and we ended up with a handicapped room on the 19th floor for no extra charge. We had a view of the City Center and the pool. As some have mentioned, the pool music was definitely audible from even the 19th floor- but it was only especially loud on Saturday and Sunday. Noise from construction was only a problem on the last day of our stay, the back-up beeping from the dump trucks started at about 630 a.m. that day. The room itself was very clean, the pillows and bedding definitely need updating, but at least I didn\u2019t see any stains, etc. The maid service was great, we left off the Do Not Disturb sign on our 3rd day, and our towels were refreshed and bed made by the time we got back a few hours later. The a/c was sort of odd, it never really got cold in the room even when we turned it down to 60 one night. And either the sink or the toilet in the bathroom gave off a faint sewage smell the whole time we were there. I used the fitness center one day for $19 per day. It has everything you need for a good workout: free weights, exercise balls, cables, and a whole line of circuit equipment with at least one machine for each muscle group. The treadmills were fairly new looking and they had bikes, ellipticals and a stepmill as well. I could never fathom paying $19 per day to use a gym in my regular life, but this was Vegas and I have read that most hotel fitness centers on the strip are priced similarly. We won the most money playing downtown, the difference was amazing. Slots on the strip are especially tight. Walking along the strip is sort of a mess right now with the City Center construction but when it\u2019s all done I am sure it will look great.

I am a Vegas regular, and my husband has been many many more times than myself, so we know what we like. I found it very hard to get Premium Economy flights direct from Manchester, (the recession has hit the airline business and it's routes hard) so hard to book a package though co op travel to get best deal. We chose Monte Carlo as it was best out of ones we were offered. It is a cheaper hotel than many, but it was not cheap cheap, our orignal bill for flights and hotel (before the upgrade) came to just under \u00a32500. Monte Carlo is a good hotel, there are just some problems. Firstly, when we checked in, the reception area was very very busy. We were seen to quickly by a wonderful recptionist called Daniela. We had only booked a deluxe room (basic room) with the intention of upgrading on check in. Daniela talked us through all the options and gave us an amazing deal. We chose the Monco suite, but due to the interconecting doors we realsied it was going to be far too loud, (they were partying next door at 1pm) so we went back to reception and took the upgrade 2 above that, the Rose Suite, staying in room 26 001. Great great room and location!! Right by lifts, so easy to go to the food court/ newsagent type shop/ casino/ spa/ pool. The ease of access to these basic things is a massive plus point with this hotel. Our suite was beautiful, pristine, massive whirl pool jacuzzi bath, kitchen area, 2 bathrooms, living area and gorgeous bedroom. The maid was wonderful, she came twice a day, and very trustworthy, we often left jewellery, money etc out, she never touched a thing. Tip your house keeping well at the end, they are super. We said we did not want a room by the pool. The noise is as bad as people say on this site. The worst pool area we have seen in Vegas, rows and rows on sunbeds like in Spain on a cheap package deal, not Vegas at all. No free water, dirty toilets, foul staff and the music bass is so loud the windows vibrate.People queued from 7:45 for the pool which opened at 9 just to get a space!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How ridiculous. People were using the European trick of going and leaving towels on the beds, which staff said was ok. Not fair. We used New York New York's pool instead which is free to Monte Calo guests and fabulous for a little pool area, lovely staff, always a sun bed free, free water, clean facilities, and loads of life gurads on duty, very safe if you have kids. Also, the walls and floors in this hotel are super thin. If we did not have this suite we could not have stayed in this hotel. Contray to the myth, in Vegas you don't party all day and night unless you're 18 years old ona weekend. If you are spending lots of money and there for a week, you like to be able to relax and enjoy your room's facilities. On the last night a group from Mexico took occupancy in suite above us and were so noisy my husband called reception twice and went up there with security. Group were very appologetic, and apparently there is a 3 strikes and you're out rule when it comes to noise. The problem was the tiles floors int he kitchen area, and furniture scraping again and again, plus dancing in high heels on it. Just disrespectful and unthoughtful. If you go to Vegas to party, go to a club or hire out a suitable suite, don't take the p**s out of other people who have paid to be there and need rest. I wouldn't stay here again simply because we have favourites (The Signature and The Hotel) and would like to visit new ones that are opening. But there are many many plus points if you get the right suite. Do not get a basic room, they are tiny, and do not get a suite with an interconnecting door. Also, don't get a room facing the pool or you will regret it. Hotel 32 is opening as a boutqiue hotel on top floor of Monte Carlo, that looks really luxurious, similiar to The Hotel and The Signature. There were many great points of this hotel though, the ease of getting food and out and about are not to be taken lightly. For example we love The Sig, but it's miles to walk through into the MGM to get food. Our suite at Monte Carlo meant hopping in the lift and then back again, it was brilliant. The thing putting me off coming back is the noise. The wrong room would be torture. My illness means I need rest, and my husband plays a lot of poker and so likes to relax too, the thought of those paper thin walls is not good.

Poker Room Small and they didn't' have enough action for DH's taste, but comparatively, the poker room at he GN was really nice.

When we got to the pool entrance, they went through our bags - I suspect to see if we had any glass? They told my husband he had to leave his beer he was drinking in the garbage (he had a plastic bottle - once he showed them that, they allowed him in with his beer - no biggie, but thought it was a good reminder to you... don't bring any in your bags either or they will have you take them out - the people in front of us had to do that.) We did not go in the wave pool, but saw it briefly, didn't look too big to be honest and I don't think the waves were very large either, more what I would bring a 5 year old too it seems. The lazy river was pretty decent, again, smaller than I thought it would be, but certainly sufficient. It was PACKED! There were four areas around the loop that seemed to have fairly powerful pushes... it was not so lazy of a lazy river... we enjoyed the hell out of it, but if others were coming for a lazy float, they would have been moving way faster. I think it is too small of a river to have people on flotation devices and siting at the side in the pool with their buckets of beer, there just wasn't enough room it didn't seem.

After using the shower, my wife reached for a towel only to notice that it had what appeared to be dried blood on it. The towell smelled like it was not even washed. Just flat out \"GROSS\"!!! My wife notified the front desk manager and all he could say was that he would have housekeeping up there and offered us two free buffets. Bulls__t!!! I then called down and talked to the front desk manager and asked for a different room. He then upgraded us to a 3rd floor suite. o.k. so far, so good!!! NOT... The suite was dirty. When we pulled up the cushion to the couch to see if it pulled out for a bed, we found a hair comb along with food crumbs and god know what else all over the sofa. Not done yet!!! The bathroom sink stopper was broken and when i went to pull it up, we found a chunk of bigfoots hair tangled around it.

No problem, he says without even an apology regarding the problems in both rooms. Customer service at its best!!! Note, the casino smelled like rotten eggs and there was construcion going in the middle of it. The shops are closed down along with a couple of the restaurants. The hotel walls paper thin and you can hear everything. The maid knocked once on the door and opened it right away. Didnt even get a chance to get to the door!!!

We booked here because we were trying to do Vegas on as little money as possible and we received a good deal on the Monte Carlo. I thought the room was adequate. It needed some updating but it was clean. There wasn't a lot of water pressure and the shower head was so low my husband had to duck to get under it and he is only 5'10''. I thought the bed was comfortable. We overlooked the pool area - not much of a view but when you get a really low rate you really can't expect much of a view and we were ok with that. We utilized the coupons they gave us at check in and saved some money. There was a food court with a Starbucks, McDs, Sbarros, Mexican (i can't remember the name but it was good). There are also a few other restaurants in the Casino. We had the dinner buffet one night - we didn't think it was bad, it was ok (buy one get one free). We ate at Cafe' one night and I thought the small plate of filet mignon with polenta and spinach was absolutely delicious. We had a few great martinis that Fernando made us (two for one special) at Andre's. We also had b-fast at an italian cafe with a patio in NY NY also buy one get one free. This was also delicious. I even thought the free drinks in the casino were pretty good - please tip the waitresses because they only make $4 an hour and depend on your tips. There were a lot of people not tipping the waitresses. More Vegas info - If we were to go again there are a few things I would do differently. I would stay closer to the area near the Bellagio or Caesar's Palace. There are free things to see and do there that begin in the evening but we were too tired to walk (because you'll walk more than you ever think you will) over to see there. If the hotel we stayed in was closer we could have gone. The treasure island pirate show, bellagio fountains (this starts at three and it is usually just one song long so it really isn't show length), the volcano eruption at the mirage - there were things I heard were good to do from people who have already been to vegas. I would have booked the show I wanted to see before we got there. (Love by Cirque Du Soleil) LV isn't like Boston where you can get same day half price tickets for almost any show. There are a limited variety of shows that have half price tickets. We also happened to go during the week that many of the shows were on vacation. This wasn't listed on any site when I was checking on line so I would call to be sure. While walking through Planet Hollywood's casino one night we were snagged by the PH timeshare people. They told us that the presentation at 10:30 would be 90 minutes long (we knew it would end up going a little longer and we had already scheduled something else at 12:30). They told us our gifts would be free tickets to a show and b-fast. Everyone in the front lobby was nice. B-fast was pre-packaged muffins or danish (they led us to believe it was a buffett). Once we got in there it was the hard hard sell - our saleman left our table a few times to do other things and we were getting aggravated and the time was going on and on. He was actually getting rude at the end and if it wasn't for the fact we had already spent over an hour with him I would have left - free tickets or not. DON'T GO ON THE TOUR. We weren't the only ones complaining about it, we ran into people in the lobby that felt the same way we did. It isn't worth the time or aggravation if you are going to be in Vegas for a short time. The show we got the tickets for was Tina and Tony's wedding. This was hysterical and the actors really got into getting the audience involved. A buffett was included and it was pretty good. Do yourself a favor and buy the tickets to go see this. Even though the tickets said general admission they assign seats before you get in there and my husband and I both got the feeling that we were seated at the table where you could see the least of the show because they were free tickets. We took the Hoover Dam/ Lake Mead cruise and we thought this was informational and interesting. We had a great tour guide named Spencer. The times can vary on this because of the traffic and security check point. We were to Fremont St experience on the last day were were there - it was a good thing we didn't have anything else scheduled because the deuce took forever to get in and out of town. They need more busses. There were so many people that were waiting to get in that couldn't fit I thought there was going to be a riot.

Pool scene was great, 3 pools...lazy river, wave pool and a regular pool along with a nice size hot tub. Dj was at pool fri/sat/sun playing hiphop, old school r&b and some old school rock. Wave pool got a lil rowdy at times...esp after 3 or so when a lot of folks were tipsy:-).......drinks were pricey, u can buy a large drink for $16.75 keep the cup and get refills for $12. I stuck with the Orange Crush and Blue Hawaiian (frozen) very tasty. Buffet wasnt very gd, esp for breakfast went once and never went back, i hear the dinner buffet is a lot better Food court has Subway, Sbarro, Mcdonalds, a chinese spot and mexican spot ....plus Starbucks. Location was gd, but still expect to do a lot of walking....the bus is very slow due to all the hotel stops, and cab fare can get pricey. Room service was excellent...always arrived in about 20-30 minutes... My daughter gambed in the casino mostly playing slots and craps, won a lil here n there. Overall a great stay and would def. recommend and return for a future visit.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is just the right size for us.\u201d", "Author": "MichiganDtb", "ReviewID": "UR36805306", "Content": "How nice it is not to have to walk a mile to the pool, to get the car, to get coffee, or to get to the casino.

I immediately asked Front Desk to find out who entered my room. I was told a maid transposed room numbers and was putting towels into my room (the wrong room). If she knocked, I didn't hear it. I shared a room with my sister. Several times during the 3 day stay my key would not work, but her key would. Most times we were together so it wasn't a problem. One day I saw a 18 year old sitting in the hallway by my room, obviously he had the same problem with key not working and was probably waiting for his roommate to come open the door. I've been listening to my son's rap music for over 10 years so I'm used to it but not used to going on vacation and hearing it so loud you can't take a nap on the 10th floor. Our room faced pool side and they blared it so loud you couldn't rest. I like to nap in the afternoon a couple hours so I stay up late on vacation, not possible at Monte Carlo. (I might add that this is hard core rap, not the usual stuff you hear on the radio, which made it even stranger to put up with.) I am 52 and more tolerating of that stuff, but was with my 78 year old mother (in the next room) so it was very unpleasant for her. I bought a package deal thru Continental Vacations. I guess MGM has a summer ticket package where you get the air/hotel/tickets to a show. Party of 4 going. 2 rooms. Was not told until after you pay the whole price that you then go to a website where you order the show tickets. Problem is they only let you enter 2 at a time and you request your first choice, 2nd and 3rd for a show. I, of course, didn't get my 2st and 2nd, but got my 3rd choice (Lion King). When I went to enter the other 2 in our party, I put Lion King as 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice, as we all wanted to go together to the same show. Guess what??? Not available. So now 2 had to go to a show at MGM that was available and 2 had to go to Mandalay Bay for Lion King, which meant the person ordering the tickets (me) had to go to both casinos personally before the show, pick up the tickets and then the day of the show drive the other 2 to another place an hour before my show. What a hassle!! I sound like a real complainer here, don't I??? On the way home the pilot (Continental) announces we are on a new plane costing so much and requiring this amount of fuel, etc. An hour later the lady behind me starts complaining of heat blowing at her (no problem with heat in my row). When we got home and picked up our luggage, my Mom notices huge blue stains on my white shorts (on the behind). Where did that come from???? I believe the \"new\" plane seat! I notice someone says in a review here that they brought 50 kids to Monte Carlo and loved it. Maybe that says it all. You have to be a kid to really enjoy the place (loud rap, kids everywhere, etc.) I have been to Vegas over 12 times and this is probably the only hotel I would steer people away from. One positive is the garage is very close to the hotel, which means not much walking. Being with an older person this could be a big deal.

The rooms are still nice-ish. They need to be updated. The linens are terrible. They need to replace all the towels and sheets asap, but the main facilities are still good. Pools have a good crowd but are not too crowded, even on the weekend. It's not the Ritz, but for the price we paid it was an excellent value. Here's the biggest thing...you MUST call in advance and request a room that is NOT on the pool side. Seriously. The other reviewers were not kidding. The music there is very loud and runs from 12-7pm. (For those of you that sleep late and get up to party, that might be cool, but I like a little afternoon snappy on my vegas jaunts.) I thought I would just make the request upon check in, thinking that on a Thursday the hotel wouldn't be too full. Wrong. They didn't have anything on the other side. I got some ear plugs, but even with them it was too loud to nap. Sigh. The ear plugs did block ALL of the construction noise and even blocked out security kicking out the people in the room next to us at 6am. (My husband told me about it later.) Other things went wrong during our stay. The billing was messed up. The internet cable for the laptop had to be replaced. The F&B dept is basically non-existent. Almost all the resto's are outside contractors who lease space. The hotel probably needs new/better training for a lot of their employees. Everyone was nice, but many seemed clueless. When things went wrong we would look at each other and shrug. None of it was too terrible...just not what it used to be in it's heyday. If you go there you MUST go and have 2 for 1 martini's at Andre's in the afternoon. Andre's is (another) restaurant that has leased space from the MC. It's the best deal going in vegas.

We arrived early form the airport and were able to check in right away. The Monte was as beautiful and clean as I remembered it. I love the Monte Carlo\u2019s location as it makes it easy to walk over to NY NY or even MGM or to the Belligio at nighttime to get a glimpse of the fountains. Our room was decent size and clean. Was shocked about how much building was being done around this hotel. I didn\u2019t like how they added the restaurant to the front since I thought it took away from the beautiful steps of Monte Carlo. The pool area was also affected. It looks like they lost some seating area due to the massive \u201cCity Walk\u201d MGM project going on right now. We did enjoy the pool area everyday we stayed there. It was still very beautiful and they had a DJ in the afternoons. We went down to the pool before it opened and there was already a line! We wanted to sit by the pool that was in the shade and had the comfy chair covers. We were successful both days to get these seats. Be warned people run out at 9AM just go cover groups of chairs with towels and are gone for hours. If your going to be there all day and want a good seat in a good location get there right before 9AM. We did eat poolside at the Brew Pub, which was great. I did find out later that the Brewpub was closing. Very sad about that but curious what they will put there. We did eat at the food court every morning before we hit the pool, which was convenient. The cost saving tip I\u2019ll share is the CVS next door. This is great for snacks, water and soda. We did eat at the Buffet one night and it was just ok and would not say one of the better buffets in Vegas such as Belligio, Paris, Rio, but again it was convenient.

Check in was ok, i did the $20 dollar trick at the desk and got up-graded to a high floor with strip view which was nice, although had to wait a few hours for the room to be cleaned, didnt mind this much as went to explore. The rooms are soooo in need of an up-date, wonky lamp shades, sheets that are not fitted and a dark feel to to the room, beds were comfy and the bathroom was clean and lots of fresh towels. The brew pub was closed as was the lance burton show (he had broken his leg??) the food court was busy in the mornings but quick service was noticed. Sharon in macdonalds never smiled once but she had a nack of getting them ques down quickly,and never once got the order wrong. Coffee was far cheaper in subway than in starbucks, and the internet accsess was $5 for 20 mins,(not bad). Diablos cantina outside was always very busy and free margharitas were given with any main meal purchased,they were also served in a very large glass insted of an egg cup which you sometimes find with \"freebies\". Food there was ok, i asked for more mayo and sure enough it was delivered super quick. Gift shop: Dont buy anything from here if you can help it, its $8 for a pack of cigies and $3 for a bottle of water, there is a cvs place next door where water is $1. What i found about the monte carlos location was outside were a lot of \"clicky clicky men\" shoving porn cards in your face and it didnt matter if you were male,female or a family, you got them, this went on all the way down to the belagio where through the walkway the street was covered in these cards, we are 35 years old and it didnt phase us, but i did see one woman try and explain it to her 6 year old!! (not good) Take your own drinks to the pool, a very skimpy waitress will come past every ten mins asking if you want drinks, we did once and it cost nearly $18 for a beer and a coke, then a tip?? Pool was great although the jacuzzie was icy cold, i saw a elderly woman in there with blue lips!! Lazy river is good fun but gets crowded by inflatables, kids pool looked quite and had a gate to stop little monsters escaping. Cafe in monte carlo was similar to Treasure Islands, almost same menu so i wasnt dissapointed, although the corned beef hash could have done with a makeover from delia smith. Try the mushroon and cheese omlette, very nice. At night coming back, the walls were thin and there was a bit of noise from the neighbours, also the trays from room service that had been left on the floor in the mornings for collection, were still there,and old pizza boxes in the hallway to trip over when youve had one too many. The casino was average, not much excitment going on, went for a craps lesson one morning and walked away as the way it was explained didnt make any sense and the dealer was far more intrested in takling about himself, there was a hour out of my life ill never get back. the drinks were free as long as you gambled,however the glasses were more of a small tumbler with far too much ice, and the waitress was rarley seen, so if your after a cheap drink, dont sit at a slot machine hoping she will come or you will find yourself putting $20 dollars in so your looking busy , just go and pay full whack for your beer , you still save money. I wouldnt stay here again, as it really needs somebody to go in and shake things up a bit, seems a bit stuck in the 70's, but a good base if your going to party,det drunk,and sleep. One word of warning,,,, when going to watch the fountains of the belagio, DONT buy water from the shop inside $8 !!!! i nearly cried when i saw a man with a ice box selling it for $1 outside the fountains.

One tip for you pool bums are to buy the larger souvenir cups the first day at the pool and reuse them the rest of the time you are there. You will get twice the amount of beverage for a little more than you would pay for a smaller one. Also the one time we ordered food while at the pool it was brought out in a timely manner and was very yummy. Just be careful when charging to your room because you could experience some sticker shock by the end of the week.

We arrived in LA, stayed in Anaheim, Palm Springs and then in Vegas for the final 10 days of our vacation. This was our third visit to Vegas and each time we've stayed in different hotels. This trip we stayed at the Monte Carlo because of the three pool areas, especially the lazy river. The lazy river was what we expected but that was the only fun thing about the Monte Carlo. We arrived in our room with a view looking through windows that had not been cleaned in years. The view was overlooking an awful construction area. Not pleasant. The Monte Carlo must be a very old hotel that has never been renovated. The room we were first assigned had large chunks of wood missing from the furniture, dark stains all over the carpet, very old-style tv, and the comforters on the beds looked like they were put there in 1980, washed from time-to-time but still old. It looked like someone urined on the desk chair. The bathroom had the same overall feeling. My thought is that when you walk into a hotel room you should never feel like a million people stayed there. But that is exactly how it was. The hotel moved us twice and the third time the room was better than the first two but not by much. We had prepaid for our room for ten nights and the hotel would not give us a full refund so we stayed there. We had prepaid months before arrival and received the summer special with a buffet 2 for 1. Don't bother going to the buffet. It is terrible - nothing but pig slop. For the Monte Carlo We paid $79 some nights and during the weekend we paid $189 per night so the hotel was not cheap. As mentioned, we were in California and Vegas all total three weeks. We stayed at a Howard Johnson in Anaheim, a Holiday Inn in Palm Springs and those hotels were great. My advice to anyone is do not stay at the Monte Carlo. I won't be staying there ever again or when I return in October!

I stayed here on a trip with 4 other girls and we got 2 rooms.

The customer service was friendly and efficient during both checkin and checkout. The location is great. It's about 3/4 of the way down the strip so you're not ALL the way at the end. It's great for walking up on one side of the Strip, and turning around and walking down the other side. It's near some other major hotels such as MGM Grand and New York, New York so it's not all by itself and it does see a lot of traffic. I came down with the flu while I was in Vegas so spent quite a bit of time in the hotel room in bed, and I can safely say that they were really comfortable! We had no problems with air conditioning at all, that all worked fine and was nice to have. The bathrooms were very roomy and clean with nice granite countertops. Lots of counterspace which is great for a room full of girls getting ready. The room service staff were really nice, as when I was sick all I wanted was either some plain toast with butter and flat Gingerale, or chicken noodle soup. While this wasn't really on the room service menu, when I called them and asked they gave me a few options that they thought would be good for someone who was sick. As most room serivce (anywhere) is expensive I would try to avoid that if you're trying to watch the spending. I only went down to the pool area once and for a short time, but the girls I travelled with were able to spend a day at the pool and said that finding an open chair wasn't too difficult (as I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas which sometimes are near impossible to find an open beach chair) and they LOVED the lazy river. It's nice to be able to float around lazily in an innertube and stay cool while soaking up some sun. There were enough palm trees around to offer some shade if you wanted it as well. For a 3-star hotel and the price that comes with it, Monte Carlo felt like a 4 star hotel with great value.

I was hit with disappointment the second I arrived. The entire MC parking structure was CLOSED to guests! They were using it for construction workers for City Center! I had to park out on the hot sun and walk about 200 yards with my heavy bags, through lots of traffic on the side alley. Valet was very packed the whole time I was there, and I hate leaving my nice car with valets. Also, like the Mirage, they have this strange check-in area, where there is no single line, and you just stand in front of each desk clerk. I had several other people walk up and get their rooms while I waited. The elevator banks are close by though, and I had one that serviced just the upper rooms. The hallway to the room was very sparse, with no decoration or feel that you are at the Monte Carlo. The room was the same and it made the NYNY look like The Palms! Nothing special about the room at all. It had most of the normal amenities, but these days hotels in Vegas should be offering something beyond \"normal\", especially for the higher rates I paid. Most of this average quality was to be found in other areas too. The pool area was packed every day of my 4 night stay, and I got the last chair each time I went. It would have been a nice pool area were it not for the loud music which made talking to your waitress almost impossible. The river they have is nice, but you need to get rid of half the people in order to have a nice swim not getting bumped into. I heard they are letting people from the NYNY use the MC's pool. Gambling, the buffet and coffee shop were also nothing special, though the service was above average. Diablo's, right out front, had great fajitas and a great view of the Strip. We ate at Andre's and had a 4 Star meal. Had the sea bass and it was worth every penny! But they would not let me open a bottle of expensive wine I'd brought. They didn't have corkage at all. The front desk clerk had given us a $25 off card to use, so once again, the service is great but some policies need to change. We ended up buying a pair of cheap wine glasses and drinking out on the steps right on the Strip! I also tried Brand, which is their steak place, but it is right off the side of the casino and open to it. Smelled lots of cigarette smoke throughout dinner. The burgers were good, but the servers are a little young for such high prices. The overall crowd at the MC was younger than I had expected and it proved that Vegas has lots of visitors. If I ran the Monte Carlo I would demand shuttles, buses or carpools for the construction workers, thus giving MC guests back their parking structure. I would also create a single check-in line, add special amenities to the rooms, lower the music at the pools, or have a separate area for adults who want more peace and quiet.

I've seen some bad reviews on beds but ours was fine and comfortable. Our room was the last one on the 27th floor so noisy neighbors and construction wasn't an issue. Another good piece of advice we took from previous reviews was bringing tubes for the lazy river with us. I think my wife bought some for under $5 compared to renting or buying at the pool. only negative I had was you couldn't sit on the edge of the pool with a drink. This is the only hotel I've been too where i couldn't drink a beer sitting on side of pool. So instead of running up a $75 bar tab per day at the pool, i bought one beer in four days b/c I didn't want to drink it sitting in my chair. As I said, we'd definitely stay here again.

We had a wonderful family reunion which included family members from Montreal, Toronto, LA and Santa Barbara. All fifteen of us stayed at the Monte Carlo. What got the ball rolling was the fact that my brother-in-law won a free five day trip to LV through work for his family, so we decided to join. Managed to get a fabulous rate of $59 for the first 3 nights, then $129 on the week-end. Having stayed at the Venetian two years aga ( first time in Vegas) , I was leary about such a stepdown. Here are my impressions: Firstly, the size of the hotel was a huge plus. It was wonderfully manageable. No walking for fifteen minutes just to reach the front desk. No big hustle and bustle in the lobby and common areas. This made sense since there is no big attraction here drawing the crowds. No theme. Just a nice marble lobby. Check in was a bit dicey upon arrival. My sister requested that we all be on the same floor. Instead, we ended up on different floors. Staff response was rather icey and not apologetic in the least. We decided not to move in the end. Too much hastle. Room: Clean. Decent enough furnishings. Came nowhere close to our suite at the Venezia Tower. Bathroom was fine. One big problem - the beds were awful (we had two Queens). I told everyone it felt like we were sleeping on water beds - filled halfway! Lumpy, soupy, lightweight. The blankets and sheets were no better. Thin linens; ugly brown woven blanket. No fluffy duvet nestled between two layers of crips sheets in this room. Honestly, I suffered with a lower backache for two months after those sleeps. Other than that, the room was adequate. We were on the fourth floor looking out at the NYNY rollercoaster. Screams and wheel grinding got going on the early side (it's a wonder why anyone would ride a rollercoaster at that hour). Oh yes, we also heard that beeping sound from garbage or construction trucks. Thank goodness for earplugs. I don't gamble, but the casino seemed decent enough. Food: Fast food choices fine for breakfast. Discovered hot oatmeal with a variety of fixings at Starbucks - yummy. Eggs were rather greasy at the breakfast stop. We had coupons for the buffet, so decided on breakfast one morning. Good selection. No complaints. Ate at one of the restaurants one night. Sorry, I've forgotten the name, but it's the casual diner type one. Overall, food was very fair and we definitely wouldn't go back. What really made us squirm was witnessing a crew (including some kind of security person or manager) totally disinfecting the table behind us, all in blue rubber gloves. They even threw out all cutlery and dishes on the table. We didn't go to the trouble of asking why all this was going on for fear of the answer. A plus for us was the location. We liked the fact that the hotel wasn't dead set in the middle of all the strip action, but rather closer to the south end where the scene wasn't so hectic. Also, made getting out of Vegas much easier, both navigation and timewise. Bottom line - would I stay at the MC again? Probably not unless we were guaranteed brand new pillow top beds and top quality duvets and linens. Did I mention that the bottom sheets weren't fitted causing them to slide off at somepoint during the night. It was totally gross waking up on the matress cover. What can I say?

We were only able to go to the pool one late afternoon. We found 4 chairs together (a plus), but I thought the pool water was very dirty.

When we got to our room, a quick check out the window revealed the ugliest view we've ever had - nothing but construction everywhere. However, we hadn't come for the view and figured that the construction wouldn't be a problem at night. Wrong! All night long, equipment delivered supplies, with crashing metal and equipment backup beeping dominating the night noise. We then understood why the guest had been trying to change his room when we checked in. The next problem was heading for breakfast. We heard the 1st emergency alarm while boarding the elevator. Alarms kept going off peridically for over half an hour and it wasn't until the 4th or 5th alarm that they bothered to announce that the alarms were only a test.

When we got there our expected Strip View was entirely blocked by a towering huge grey wall which turned out to be part of the new City Centre project. The beds were Ok but why don't they supply decent plump pillows instead of the dolls house variety? My wife and I have been staying at (and recommending) the Monte Carlo since it opened in 1996 and have seen a steady decline in just about every aspect of the Hotel. On our last visit 18 months ago we saw the start of the City Centre construction right next to the hotel -and the noise and dust that accompanied it. The once-fabulous pool area has been greatly reduced (the Lazy River wasn't working the day we arrived) and the whole environment is overshadowed by what appears to be the Backside of Benidorm. - and a huge grey warehouse-style abomination that completely ruins the view. Even the cooling waterfalls have gone. On arrival at the pool at 9am everyone had their bags searched (no, not for bombs) but - \"due to a change of policy we don't allow any food in the pool area\" we were told by an officious Border Guard and my wife had her bag of crisps promptly confiscated - as did a kid behind with a half-eaten bag of popcorn. When I asked why people were being allowed in with their coffee I was told: \"Coffee is OK but no food.\" \"So not even a Danish bought in the Hotel to accompany my Starubucks?\" I queried - only to be told that pastries were on the forbidden list! Safely past the sentries I went for some towels: \"Only two per guest\"! the girl barked when I took four. \"But I need 2 for my wife as well\" I protested and was sulkily supplied with another pair. But before we had time to settle on our longers the most ear-splitting noise (it could not be described as music) blasted our eardrums. Don't get me wrong I like music (Will Smith's my hero) but this was not the usual Monte soft rock -it was Gangsta Rap at full blast and went on mercilessly all morning. People were complaining all around the pool and one couple went into Reception to lodge their objections, then more people joined the queue. All to no avail. On the second morning (after our food search) \"Yo Momma! Yo momma!\" was belting out again -it was relentless - and more people complained but we were told that \"The music is streamed down from a satellite so we can't change it.\" (Yes you heard that correctly). I don't know if the Manager is a friend of Snoop Doggy Dog but despite the daily protests of his paying guests he refused to either play something which might be appreciated by the majority of his paying guests - or lower the volume. When I complained at Reception I was advised \"When you get home fill in a form on the Website.\" Brilliant. Instead I wrote a very a strong letter on Monte notepaper and handed it in - as we checked out in disgust! What contempt for their guests - no wonder the place is in terminal decline. Even Lance Burton went AWOL - his Theatre closed until further notice -he was apparently 'off sick' (why am I not surprised). Shopping in The Street of Dreams consisted of one lonely shop (the others were closed) and the hotel Hypermarket had disappeared to make space for the new Mexican-themed Diablo Cantina which was lively, fun, busy and totally out of character with the Hotel's 'classy' French Rivera theme. When we ventured outside the Hotel we constantly had pimps thrusting 'girls for hire' cards at us. I later counted thirteen (yes thirteen) pimps in a line so that holidaymakers had to run a gamut of sleaze before escaping to yet another line of pushers a few yards up the Strip. I cannot stress enough our disgust with the management of the Monte Carlo (and I repeat we've been regular guests for nearly thirteen years) and we certainly will neither be returning, nor recommending this pit to any more friends. We checked out and went to the Treasure Island Hotel after spotting a great offer on the Expedia website (one free night in five).

I had to pick the individual pills off after I dried myself. The bed linens were in pretty bad shape. My blanket had cigarette burns on it. I hate to think what else was on the sheets. Yuck! The mattress was the worst I have ever slept on. My back was killing me the whole time I was there. I've slept in sleeping bags on a cot that were more comfortable. I had read the reviews about the pool area...about the loud music. It was very annoying. I could not understand the reasoning behind it. There were no college kids bumping and grinding to the music. Especially since the pool closed in the early evening. I had to turn my iPod on high to drown out the annoying pop/hip hop crap. However, the pool itself was nice. I really enjoyed the lazy river pool. There wasn't an excess amount of chlorine in the pools so my skin and eyes did not suffer. We tried the morning buffet. The food was average but it was the process of getting the table that was a pain. We were the only two people waiting to be seated at the time but it was this huge ordeal. The hostesses had walkie talkies, we could see the food/kitchen just a short ways down a hall but we could only walk a few paces where we were stopped then ushered a few paces further, then stopped and finally shown to our seats. We were the only ones in line! It was ridiculous! On other thing is the coffee. I don't think I've been to a place that doesn't have actual half and half cream for coffee.

Situated in between the Bellagio and the New York, New York and across from the MGM- it's perfect.

It's usually one of the least expensive choices when we buy in a package deal (airfare from NYC + hotel). We like the location because there is a drugstore (I think CVS or Walgreens) right next door. We don't rent a car so it's very convenient for us to get snacks or bottled waters at the drugstore. At the hotel, they usually double or triple the price so it does save us money overall. You can walk to other hotels or take the bus. The hotel rooms are standard size and pretty nice and clean. The AC can be easily controlled. The bathroom is standard Vegas style - nice, clean, modern. There is cleaning service everyday like all other Vegas hotels. Most of the time we stayed there, the staff was accommodating and very nice. For instance, our power went out due to construction going on in the section of the hotel we were staying at for a few hours. My husband's medication (which has to be refrigerated) was affected. The staff was really nice and comped us. However, there have been a couple incidences where the staff was not accommodating and gave us grief but after talking to the managers, everything was smoothed out. The casino is pretty standard - slots and tables, as well as sports center where you can bet and watch your teams! Our fave game is blackjack and we have experienced good luck overall at this hotel. Another big plus is that they have one of the best fitness centers/gym in Vegas. Yes, we are \"those\" people who actually work out during our vacation!!! If you are too, this is your place! There is a charge - but I think you can get a 3-day deal for about $45. It's big and they have everything from cardio equipment to weight machines to free weights (heavy weights). One year, we were staying there during a Vegas event for body builders. We met a few contestants in the Monte Carlo gym. The only reason they were staying there was because Monte Carlo gym is known to have the best gym equipment. There are a few restaurants at this hotel but I don't think any of them are too memorable. They were overall pretty average (not horrible at all, just nothing special). Their buffet is standard and very average. I prefer the buffet at the Bellagio or Rio's Seafood Buffet. They do have a Starbucks at least! My husband and I usually love relaxing by the pool or going swimming... their pool area is very sunny...however, the Monte Carlo pool is overcrowded. They have three pools but they are all super crowded. The river pool is very shallow and not wide enough. If there are slow people in front of you, it's hard to pass them. You can sit in the other pools but you can't really go swimming because there are too many people. Every year, it seemed like it was getting more and more crowded. (However, I'm not sure if it'll still be crowded this year in 2009 since the economy is down). To summarize, here are the pros and cons: Pros: - Great location, next to drugstore - Starbucks - Best gym on the strip - Hotel rooms are nice and clean - Staff is usually accommodating Cons: - Pool is overcrowded - Nothing special about the restaurants", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel, good location, loud pool\u201d", "Author": "MrsOtter", "ReviewID": "UR30621054", "Content": "The pool area is nice with just enough shade, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the music is SO loud!

We spent about \u00a3200 in total for 5 nights and, once in the rooms, they were very similar to the MGM, not surprising as it's owned by the same group.

It is too bad that this lovely hotel has decided to go this route. Yes, Vegas is Sin City, and yes, people go here to have a good time but not everyone is looking for Animal House. Many other hotels have \"adult\" pools separate from the regular pool so guests have a choice of where they want to be. At the Monte Carlo, there is no choice!

The line only had a couple people, however they kept calling people over from the other lines. Needless to say, my husband was very frustrated! I guess we shouldn't complain as we were getting the room for free. so to speak. The bathroom was bigger than, say, New York, New York, but not as big as TI and Mandalay Bay. We loved the food court, my husband had a large breakfast at Sbarro every morning, brought my coffee and hash browns up to the room for me, and enjoyed the guacamole and chips at Rubios. Even though we don't like buffets in general, we had the lunch buffet on our last day and the price was around $30 (?) total. I enjoyed a \"made to order\" Philly Cheese Steak and thought it was something different than the usual made to order pasta etc. The casino is a bit dated (we stayed there shortly after it opened), but easy to navigate and had large aisles. We went out to the pool one day and the only complaint I have is that none of the beverage servers made it over to our area. I went to the pool bar and bought a double rum & coke and Malibu & diet for $33. The cups were probably 12 oz. Weather was high 70's, lower 80's. The crowds weren't bad, a sign of the times. I must say that the staff was friendly and nice compared to the staff at New York, New York when we were there in Oct 2008.

Boy, were we disappointed! I don't think we will ever plan another trip there and if we do, we sure won't stay at the Monte Carlo. We spent a lot of money there and the comps are terrible. We ended up getting 2 buffets a piece and we ate at the dinner buffet once while we were there and it was comparable to a Luby's, but twice the price. Taking advantage of our comped buffets when we checked out almost took an act of congress. The people at the players club are very inexperienced and every time you want to know about your comps they have to get on the phone to some secretive \"marketing\" person. The front desk is just as bad - they can't tell you anything about your comps. Therefore everyone is sending you running around from desk to desk. The rooms are okay, but don't expect fresh towels daily and don't expect coffee in the morning when you wake up. Unless you pay the outrageous price for room service coffee or go downstairs and purchase coffee from McDonald's or Starbucks. Another thing - bring your own sodas or water with you to the room because there are no complimentary bottles of water left in your room and the soda machine on at least 2 floors that we checked was taped up and out of order! After going to two floors looking for a soda machine that worked, we just gave up and went back to our room. They did not have wifi internet access. You had to plug into an ethernet port and then that did not even work. You could access the internet by PAYING a $5 minimum at a little public kiosk in their lobby. If you want to print your boarding passes from there they charge you another $1 per page!!!! The slots were so tight that we did not see anyone winning anything. We spent a lot of money and playtime in their casino and it was crap. My advice: don't go. If you want to go to an excellent hotel/casino that knows how to treat their patrons and don't want to travel to Las Vegas, try L'auberge du lac in Lake Charles, LA.

The rest of the hotel was very clean with the usual casino, food court, restaurant and buffet places. We liked the fact that although it had all this - as it was not particularly a themed hotel it was better and a bit more of an escape from the others. The staff were very helpful and very well organised - especially in the buffet section - almost military! We only ate in the buffet for breakfast and once for dinner and it was excellent food and value. The building site next door did take the wow factor off the strip a bit and it would be unfortunate if you were looking out onto it. We thought the hotel was good value, comfortable and good location as it sits pretty much in the middle of the main hotels.

I recommend getting the bus passto get around town on the \"Deuce\". The 24 hr pass is $7 or a 3 day pass @ $15 & can be purchased right on the bus. Unlimited rides during the time frame!! Well worth the price since one bus ride is $3. And since the buses on \"the Strip\" are double decker, go up the stairs to get a view of the night life. The bus stops right in front of the hotel when coming fromthe Fremont (north) direction but to head back that way, you have to get to the front of the MGM to catch the bus.

Also, allow extra time for your shuttle pick up to the airport. Allowed an extra 1/2 hour but since there were so many hotel stops, it got late.

It's always been good value, it's a great location and while it can't offer good bars and restaurants like other strip hotels it has a solid quality to it that has always appealed. And my wife and I loved relaxing out by the excellent pool..... until now. As we neared the colossal building site loomed into view, engulfing the hotel on three sides in noise, dust and site traffic. But not to worry, that's not really the hotel's fault. Our room was decent enough and we were checked in early. The windows were caked in dust from the site, rendering the extra paid for a view a little wasteful, but you don't go to Vegas to sit in your room, do you. We still weren't going to let such things bother us. But the gross mismanagement of this hotel became clear when we decided to hit the pool, which is an essential part of a Vegas stay. Much of the pool side terraces have been sold off to the building project and the remaining area sees sunbathers packed in like sardines between the various pools. But fortunately the management at the Monte Carlo have found a way to limit the number of people competing for space in the sun. The music around the pool is so loud and so awful that it destroys any notion of a relaxing lie out by the pool, reading or drinking. It is so loud it will literally make you feel sick. I wish I was joking. I'm no stranger to outdoor music festivals and rock concerts but have never heard a noise like it. I imagine they are trying to drown out the noise of the building site, but even still, it makes the pool totally off-limits. My wife and I like to gamble and have a fair few drinks of an evening and then crash out by the pool to recover. it's the only way to be in Vegas. But not so at the Monte Carlo, not any more it would seem. Worse still, not to sound too geriatric about this, but the music sounds like the creation of the manager's son who has begged his dad to let him play some of his mixes by the pool. It's truly appalling. The sort of thing you'd expect to hear if you bought a tone deaf nephew a set of decks for Christmas, played at a volume rivaled only by a Boeing 747 taking off. However... and this is a nice touch. If you looked to escape into to the Brew Pub for a bite of lunch, not only does it look like a canteen for the monstrous building site, covered in dust and littered with hard hats and high-visibility jackets, they also had a fire alarm which went off every 15 minutes for the duration of our stay. This was explained away as \"it's nothing to worry about\"... well, it is pretty annoying. Much like the way the Monte Carlo is now run. The accommodation and staff were pleasant and despite the MASSIVE building site, the location of the Monte Carlo remains outstanding. However, some basic but important failings mean this is a hotel I could never return to, even in a couple of years when the building work may finally be complete. We went on to the Luxor instead. Not ideal but in comparison it is sooo much better. However, if it wasn't for conferences filling many of the better hotels we would have gone for Caesars Palace which now is uncontested as my favourite Vegas hotel, where previously the Monte Carlo was snapping at its heels.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foster City, CA", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait until the surrounding construction is over...\u201d", "Author": "FCTraveler044", "ReviewID": "UR28720388", "Content": "I like the Monte Carlo quite a bit.

The lobby of the hotel is relatively impressive, and check-in was fairly painless. The room was not all that impressive. It was kind of small and a little dingy, though the bathroom was really nice. The beds were comfortable, except for the non-fitted sheets which did not want to stay on the mattress. I asked for a room away from the construction noise, and did not hear any of the construction noise while in my room, or elsewhere on the premises. I did hear noise from the adjoining rooms, and was awakened once around 4:00 a.m. by a couple of lovebirds in the room next door. The pool area is nice, though it was a bit too chilly for us to swim while there. I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino, so can't really comment on it. The food court was very handy considering we had kids with us. We had the buffet once, and it was very good, especially the desserts. Much better than the Excalibur's, which is the only other Vegas buffet I've tried. The biggest gripe I had is with the internet service. They advertise high speed internet for $14.99 a night. What I didn't learn until I got there was that that price is PER laptop (we had 3) and you can only use 1 laptop at a time, because it is not wireless. I ended up going with a service called Traveler's Wi-Fi, which was much cheaper, but I had a crappy connection the entire time I was there. There were probably better alternatives, but of course, I couldn't research them without an internet connection to begin with.

We were in town to see The Beatles Love at the Mirage. Overall I would give the Monte Carlo very positive reviews. I like the Monte Carlo because the casino is fairly small by strip standards and not so hard to find people or lengthy walks to get places. The casino was very nice, clean and very good drink service. The rooms were nice and clean. Diablos Cantina was a lot of fun during Happy Hour with crazy drink specials with the female bartender pouring wild shots while standing on the bar. My only complaint involved an incident at the Cafe and involves something that would have never happened in Vegas 15 years ago before the whole town went corporate. After we returned from the show at the Mirage we went for a quick bite to eat the Cafe before going to bed. While we were in the process of being seated the hostess had a fight with three servers right in front of our table over who was going to be our server. We waited for about 10 minutes and no one even brought water to our table or took our drink orders. If the cafe had been busy I would have understood, but it was close to 90% empty. I called over the hostess to ask if there was a problem and she said someone would be with us shortly. We waited a few more minutes and still no one came to our table to even bring us water, let along take our food order. I then complained rather sternly to the manager about what the problem was with the service. She informed me that if I did not calm down she was going to call security and have me removed. This despite the fact that we had been waiting for 15 minutes with no assurance we would get water let alone dinner. I told her this level of service was not acceptable and she told me that she would not speak to me until I calmed down. I saved her the trouble and our party just left the cafe. 15 years ago that would never have happened in Vegas and is now one of the reasons I go to Laughlin now rather than Vegas. 15 years ago that manager would have go to the kitchen themselves to get the water and probably comped our meals. But in these modern times where these corporate casinos have to squeeze every dime out of every possible source of cash in the hotels customer service has to take a hit. So instead of taking care of us, the manager was complete rude and disrepectful to me and probably cost her resturant $100 that night.

Check-in was quick, we asked to be located away from the construction going on next door and they happily obliged. The room was standard and fine for us - clean and nice enough. Noise - We did hear construction the first night (a few bangs like they were moving steel) at about 4 am so it probably was very loud if you were on the construction side of the hotel but that was all we heard in 3 nights. We heard our neighbors once but then they were either quiet or never in their room...if you had noisy ones I suppose that could have been a problem but we were lucky. Casino - The casino is a little smokier than others but also a little quieter which was okay with me (we just went to the other hotels... we don't gamble much, maybe 2 hours total the whole trip). Food - We ate at the food court for breakfast the first morning and it was standard Starbucks (yes the prices are a little higher but what do you expect, if you want the cheaper prices you have to leave the hotel and go across the street to that food court - we were willing to pay a couple bucks more for the convenience). The second morning we went to the cafe...the \"Ultimate Oatmeal\" is good and huge enough for 2 people to easily share (maybe even 3 people) so we both ate for under $12. We had a free buffet and used it for dinner...not impressed with that. The food wasn't BAD but it also wasn't great or exciting (kind of like a college cafeteria level of food instead of a resort buffet level). If you had to pay for it, it wouldn't be worth it...go elsewhere. The pool was closed until March but they told us we can go next door to the Bellagio and use their pool/hot tub (for free). Check out was easy. Housekeeping was nice and I thought they did a fine job. Location is excellent (I was bummed that the tram to the Bellagio is gone because now you have to walk past all the construction to get there but it's still a good location) .

The construction going on next door can be loud at times and it definitely blocks the view of the strip and we were on the 23 rd floor. Las Vegas is definitely going through a recession because now you find deals like the old days, ie; 2 for 1 at the steakhouse (Brand), 2 for 1 at the Cantina mexican restaurant etc. The slot machines were very tight no matter what you play and we played alot of them but could'nt come ahead.The only show we went to see was the Phantom of the Opera and it was worth every penny. I can't begin to tell you how elborate the production is so do yourself a favor and go see it. Across the street from the Monte Carlo is a ticket office that provides half price tickets to most shows. If you get there at 9:30 am you get the best deals. Also on our trip we visited the Las Vegas Outlet mall and found really great deals on alot of different items. all in all we would probably not return to the MC mainly because of the location and view (city center office tower) blocks everything includind the sunlight.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cAvoid if you can...\u201d", "Author": "ScrappyGal", "ReviewID": "UR23878228", "Content": "I had pretty low expectations arriving at the Monte Carlo, but my stay ended up even worst than expected. 1 - Though I specifically asked for a non-smoking room, I was assigned to a smoking floor.

However, the hotel has not kept up with the rest of the hotels along the strip - it is looking worn down and outdated. We booked a package that included two free buffets, a $30 spa credit, and margaritas at Diablos. We used the buffet credits for dinner one night and the food at the buffet was frightful - thank goodness it was free. I would definitely skip this and pay for some decent food, as there are many other far superior choices at nearby hotels. We also went to Diablo's and got our free margaritas (champagne glass sized for $9 each) the food was decent and the service was good, but the atmosphere was, like most of Vegas these days, geared towards drunken vulgar partiers, with alot of screaming \"Woooo's\" throughout dinner which becomes annoying after about 2nd time. After these two experiences, we decided to skip the spa credit and consider ourselves ahead. As for the casino, it was pretty empty most of the time we were there. But the worst part was that the casino has a particularly vile pungent odor of musty smoke mixed with years of spilled alcohol, etc. that is reminiscient of a has-been Vegas casino. Thankfully you can bypass the casino for the most part by walking down the side street and going in a side entrance. You just have to avoid the annoying and persistent sidewalk smut peddlers that crowd stretches of sidewalks along the strip, but particularly the short street between the NYNY and MC. A HUGE disappointment was that the pools were closed (although no one tells you this ahead of time) as the weather was quite nice the entire weekend - this IS the desert for goodness sakes! I heard that they were open until mid-December when it snowed and they wouldn't open again until sometime in March possibly. When I asked the concierge if there were any other pools open at the other hotels, he gave a terse \"No\" and turned away - not exactly the customer service you'd expect. Anyways, check-in and check-out was relatively quick and the clerks were friendly and helpful. And I was happy to see that all the freebies were taken off our bill as promised (you have to charge the package freebies to your room and then they remove them from your bill). The lobby is still in good shape and kept nice with fresh flowers. Our standard room overlooked the strip along with the vast rooftop of the casino strewn with mechanical units, and was on the side of the hotel close to the City Center project (which looks like a stark steel and glass urban landscape - yuck!) we only heard minimal construction noise on one day and it wasn't until 10am - no one appeared to be working over the weekend and most construction in Las Vegas has slowed considerably due to the economic downturn. The room was somewhat worn, but decent enough - it is showing its age with it's old bedspreads, old TV armoire with old tube-TV, tarnished plumbing fixtures, cracked marble tiles in bathroom, slow draining bathtub, etc.. Based on a previous post regarding bed bugs, I thoroughly inspected every inch of our bed, and thankfully found nothing (except to confirm that they indeed do not use fitted sheets which is annoying since the flat sheets they use just barely tuck under the sides and pull out and tangle up around you as you sleep - I guess this must somehow save them money?!?). On the positive side, they do have a surface level parking lot across from the lobby entrance that guests could use free, or you could have your car valet parked for free (except for the valet's tip). We parked our car ourselves in the lot and found this easy, safe and convenient, as we were always able to easily find parking and they have 24 hr security guards on bicycles in the lot.

When I booked this, I wanted to stay more in the middle of the strip, but the prices were a lot higher there so I chose the MC. Both registration and check out were easy and quick. We had arrived early in the day so checked our bags with the bellman and walked the strip. Everything we wanted to do - shows, food, the mall - were really far away. Our feet were begging for rest when we returned at 3:40 pm to get into our room. (we were told check in time was 3 pm). We put the key in the door and it opened to find that it hadn't been cleaned yet. Spoke to the housekeepers and had it cleaned next. Took another half hour. The room itself was very comfortable. It suited our purposes just fine. Always had clean towels and bathroom amenities. There was a constant dripping from the bathtub faucet which we called about but did not get fixed. Breakfast buffet was huge with lots of variety and at $12.88 was cheaper than a lot of other ones on the strip. I thought when I booked this hotel that it was of a high enough standard that it would not attract loud and raucous partiers on our non-smoking floor, (I appreciated this after walking through smoky casinos) but unfortunately, the last night of our 3-night stay, we were kept awake and then woken up again by people next door and across the hall. They were loud, running around, and we could hear someone throwing up in the bathroom, another asking, \"what were you thinking?\" etc. We called security. When we left the next morning, we noticed a stone art piece that had been hanging on the wall was now on the floor of the hallway, there was either wine or blood on the hall carpet, and the door to our neighbor's room was plastered with those business card size ads for calling nude women that are handed out up and down the strip in the afternoons (unfortunate that this happens with children around).

Normally, the majority of MGM Mirage hotels (Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mirage, Mandalay Bay, etc.) are either new, or have recently renovated their rooms to look new; however, this hotel is definately an exception. We stayed in a spa suite overlooking the strip. The room was about 700 sq. ft. and the spa sat beside the window that overlooked the strip. There were many positives. First, the price. We booked a package for three nights that included four free buffets (the buffet is $20 per person at night), 2 large margaritas, food court coupons, and a spa suite for $79 dollars per night. Not a bad deal. Second, there is a food court in the hotel. This comes in handy when you want to eat lunch for a reasonable price at Subway, McDonalds, etc. Third, the hotel has a nice pool complex. Although it was closed during our stay we did manage to see it. There were various pools, lazy river, etc. There were also many negatives. First, the casino. I love to play cards, and a big reason for that is the atmosphere in the casinos. When I play at MGM Grand or Planet Hollywood it is fun because the casino itself is hip and exciting. However, when I walk through the casino at Monte Carlo, I don\u2019t know what other word to use but \u201cblah.\u201d The casino is small and boring. Second, Even if you get a \u201cstrip view room,\" like the one we had, the view will still suck. The reason is the hotel is boxed in between two tall structures on both sides. Basically, the only thing that you will see with a \u201cstrip view room\u201d is the MGM Grand that basically sits across the street. Instead of calling it a \u201cstrip view\u201d Monte Carlo should call it an \u201cMGM Grand view.\u201d Third, and like I briefly mentioned earlier, the Monte Carlo is simply outdated. I was shocked to find out it was built in 1996. It looks as if it was built in the 70\u2019s. The tv\u2019s are small, carpet\u2019s dirty, etc. Overall, we will probably not stay at the Monte Carlo again. The hotels on the strip offer promo codes that make it possible to stay at places like MGM Grand and Treasure Island for about the same price. I would say that at least 90% of the hotels on the strip are larger, newer-looking, and more exciting.

The bed sheets are not fitted and not tucked properly and would slip loose just by sleeping on them causing you to wake up and notice part of your body is on that nasty exposed mattress. All in all, the room can be summed up by saying it was dated, dirty, nasty, rough, etc. The atmosphere within the hotel/casino can be described as similar to being in a casino located next to a retirement home where the locals often take advantage of the early bird specials. I don't believe I saw one day where the casino was even semi full, it seemed like there were more people in the food court than in the casino or bars. The decor in the lobby, casino and bar is blan, and hard to get excited about. I would say that this hotel does not provide customers with the experience or the atmosphere of being in vegas.

When we arrived, they put us in a non-smoking room with two queen beds. We thought, as long as it is non-smoking, it is fine with us. We have a queen bed at home, so we didn't see a problem. The carpet seemed newer, a big plus. There were no immediately visible gross elements to the room. When it was time to go to bed, however, it was a whole different story- The most awful offense, in my opinion, was that the sheets on the matress were not fitted. So, when you un-made the bed and pulled the top sheet back, you un-did the bottom sheet as well. Any movement in the bed pulled up the sheet covering the matress and bunched up the thin (the size of a full matress blanket) matress pad underneath the unfitted bottom sheet. The matress was uncomfortable and we tossed and turned all night. I woke up at one point and the sheet had shifted so much, half of my body was on exposed matress. I was seriously grossed out. We called the next day to ask for fitted sheets and they said they did not have any in the hotel. They answered as if it was not the first time they had heard this request. I do not believe those matresses were standard queen matresses. We did not have the same room we normally do at home. Noise seemed to carry especially well in this hotel. We were on the 21st floor, but could hear people revving their engines in the parking garage. Every noise the neighbors made came clearly through the wall, as I am sure our noise did as well.

I wouldn\u2019t consider my trip the typical \u201cVegas Trip\u201d seeing that I was there for work related purposes. I stayed at the Monte Carlo and I would recommend this hotel to others in the near future if they don\u2019t mind looking past a few things. First of all, the construction is rather bad right now. The City Center going up next to the MC is a huge undertaking and the construction crews are working almost around the clock. I like to think I am a rather deep sleeper but even I couldn\u2019t sleep through their construction noise. Every morning at 6:00 AM the construction crews start and you will probably hear every rivet being put into place. If I was coming back to my room at 5:00 AM and I tried to go to sleep with the sound of jackhammers outside my window I would be less that happy to say the least. Something else about the MC that I couldn\u2019t help but notice was the \u2018aging\u2019 it seemed to have. The casino seems to be a little outdated and was almost never busy like some of the others. I also thought the casino had a strange \u2018old lady\u2019 smell going on. Laugh all you want but if you have been there you might know what I\u2019m talking about. Their air system at the MC probably cannot hold up to the amount of smoke being taken in so they resort to a brain-numbing scent to try and cover up the smell of Misty cigarettes. The food court in the hotel is pricy and dated. A colleague of mine said he paid $7 for ice cream cone and I spent $12 for some bad Chinese food all within the food court. Unless you are there to pick up a coffee at Starbucks or an Egg McMuffin from McD\u2019s, go out for food. One major plus to the hotel was the location. For the price (broke down to $65 a night) you cannot beat the location. You are on the strip and within walking distance to all of the major hotels/casinos and right next to a CVS if you need to pick up anything you forgot.

First comment --- the room is just plain \"tired and worn.\" The bedding is scuzzy with piling on the polyester bedspreads. The desk and tv cabinet are old and chipped and the lighting is horrible!!! I felt like a troll in a dungeon! The bathroom is decent size but the the whole room made me feel as though I was in a Motel 6. The walls are paper thin and we could hear everything in the room next to us. Thankfully there wasn't much late night noise. It was almost frightening to look out the window on the 28th floor and see how \"thin\" the walls actually are. The windows are pretty cheap as well. The casino is okay. The food in the restaurants was above average and reasonably priced and all the employees were very friendly which was a nice bonus.

I had been reading the reviews before we left and I was nervous about our choice..but I am so glad that I didn't change our reservations. Check in was very fast, the staff all very helpful and courteous. The lobby is beautiful as is the casino. Very elegant. We asked for, and were given ,a room facing the strip. We did have to wait a few hours for it but since our arrival time was 0930, this wasn't a surprise. The room was large and very clean. There were no bugs....believe me I checked! I have to agree with the person who said they didn't like the soap but it is easy enough to pick up anything you might want at the CVS next door. The rooms are what I would call moderate. Nothing elaborate, the TV has basic channels, the rug is a little worn, the walls are a little thin but for the money, it is an excellent value and the location is very good. It is extremely handy to have the food court in the hotel. I would much rather run down to the Starbucks and grab coffee and a danish to eat in the room while getting ready for the day than to have to get ready and then go and find a restaurant. We checked out the pool and lazy river but didn't go in. The pools looked inviting and there was lots of seating. But I have to say that the construction site next door has pretty much obliterated any sun over the pool area. I have read others calling the construction an eyesore..but that doesn't begin to describe it. It is an enormous venture with 6 large skyscrapers being built at the same time. It is huge....takes up about one New York City block..and they work on it 24 hours a day. I never heard any noise while in the hotel though so don't let noise concern you. There is always going to be construction in Vegas! The casino in the Monte Carlo is quite large and not as busy as other casinos. I like that..I am in my early 50s and not interested in the mid 20s crowd of drinking and partying (why do young men all have to yell? ) If you want that experience just cross the street and go to the MGM any Friday or Saturday night. We went into pretty much all of the casinos and did not hear anyone hitting the jackpot...ever. I guess the economy has effected Vegas too. On that note, I also noticed several beggars...even inside of the casinos..something I have never seen before in Vegas. Very sad. The card flickers are out in full force too...but at least they have jobs! If you decide to go shopping at the premium Outlet Mall near Fremont street, it is well worth the trip. Great bargains and lots of stores to choose from. The best way to go is to take the monorail to the Sahara and then take a cab from there. The cost will be about $15. We mistakenly took the deuce bus from the Sahara and ended up at the bus terminal near Fremont to switch buses. This is an experience the average person could do without. Unless you have a desire to see dozens of homeless people or have gang members sucking their teeth at you....I would avoid it like the plague. And this was at 1 oclock in the afternoon! I can't imagine what being there after dark would be like. Oh wait, I can imagine it...and no thanks. We took the bus to Laughlin for the day. I like the trip through the desert but the town itself is nothing much. There are about 8 casinos along the river...they are not as nice as the ones in Vegas of course..but they are not bad. There is a very nice boardwalk along the river which leads to a small public beach. We went in the water just to say that we had been in the Colorado River. It was so clean and fresh...lovely! There is also a small outlet mall across the road from where the bus drops you off. The bus driver won't tell you about it..they are trying to get you into the casinos! The trip costs $5 and they throw in a free buffet lunch which was quite good. If you are only in Vegas for a few days, I wouldn't bother..but if you are there for a week and would like a break from the crowds, then I would recommend this trip. You leave about 8 in the morning and get back around 6. I enjoyed it but I don't think it is the kind of thing you would do twice. Kinda like the Hoover Dam..I enjoyed it the first time, but really its just water..and a dam. How many times can you see it? I realize I am writing a book here...so that's about it. I would stay at the Monte Carlo again. The location is very good...the monorail is at the MGM across the street..or you can walk next door to NY NY, then walk over to Excalibur and take their tram to Luxor or Mandalay Bay.

Wanted to try something different. This hotel has a very nice lobby. I was checked in very quickly even though the reservation was in my mom's name, but she couldn't go at the last minute due to the fact that she was in the hospital and we couldn't get back the money. Hence, I went. I was checked in as I said with very nice people. I went into the jacuzzi and that was fantastic. I also went into the Lazy River Pool and that was great! The room was good, clean with a view of some roof top. I have read earlier reviews about all the buildings being built and the noise - Whether I was at the pool or in the room, I never heard anything!!! So, don't believe everything you read!!!!!!! The bathroom was very nice, can't complain. They replenished the supplies fast. The only thing (and this is serious nitpicking) is that I didn't like the soap - but who cares, cause I brought my own anyway. There is a CVS right next door and a Walgreens across the street- so if you forget anything, you can get it there. I also suggest that before you start buying tourist gifts, go to both of those stores and save yourself a fortune. A shirt is a shirt, you know what I mean? I did use their concierge and they were amazing! I don't remember his name, but he has red hair, and I put that poor man through the ringer trying to find me a good trip to the Grand Canyon. He told me that if I didn't like the trip after I did it, the hotel would reimburse me the money. I thought to myself, how could I possibly go wrong? I booked it right there and then, and it was an amazing trip!!!!! The tour driver took us to the Grand Canyon and we had unscheduled stops on Rte 66 and we stopped at an Indian Trading Post and were able to stretch our legs quite a bit. We also stopped for pictures of wild animals, and he actually let me off the bus so that I could go chase down some Elk and take pictures.... Nice guy!!!!!! Hint: Don't forget to tip the drivers- they don't get paid a lot of money to do these 10 hour trips believe it or not - and the tips really do help. We gave him $20.00 (\"we\" being my boyfriend and myself) Of course, when we got back, we stopped at the Concierge and had to tell him what an amazing time we had!!!!! The casino: Well, it wasn't built on winners.... I don't do a lot of tables, so I won't comment on those, but the slots? Well, I didn't see anyone win. I play them A LOT and I can tell you that the only time I won was playing a penny slot and I had like .50 left, and I hit the bonus! Figures, right????? The very last night I was there, I stayed on the slot machine, I Dream Of Genie for like 5 hours. It was ridiculous!!!! so, that was good. If your going to play that -it's in the back near the elevators.... there are four back to back. Play the ones facing the front of the casino so that you have your back to the elevators... those paid out more... Trust me!!!! Food: They have a Mcdonalds, a Sbarro's, Starbucks and some other type of fast food restaurants - so you can get a cheap breakfast or a quick snack at lunch. Save yourself some money- instead of eating at fancy restaurants for $40.00 + pp, eat a breakfast there. They do have the fancy smancy restaurants too - don't get me wrong, but I didn't pack fancy clothes, and I know better than to try and get in wearing jeans.... Dinner: Across the street is Outbacks Steakhouse and there was no wait, great food, decent pricing. I work next door to one and I love these restaurants!!! By the by- they do accept jeans... LOL Paris has a nice buffet for dinner too, that is decently priced. Flamingo has a nice buffet as well- if your into Seafood - Holy cow !!! The King Crab legs... ( I don't eat seafood, but watching the others eat, they got their money worth and then some!) I did the Eiffel Tower, that was cool, but we were just at Paris in Sept. - so if you haven't done the actual Eiffel Tower (in Paris) you will love this!!!!! But If you have done the real Eiffel Tower (in Paris), the elevator ride on this is a piece of cake!!!! Still nice views of the strip and the Bellagio waters....Bring your camera. Worth the money. Overall, the hotel is very nice. if you are on a budget and want something nice, book this hotel. But do beware that 8 - yes, 8 buildings are going up around Monte Carlo- so the pool doesn't have a lot of direct sunlight, so sunbathing may be an issue as these buildings are going up..... Also, the monorail stops at MGM so you have to hoof it across the street over to NY and past that, so if your really tired of walking and your feet are killing you it seems like a very long walk!

This is our second stay; we stayed exactly one year ago. Both visits were very nice, no complaints in particular. We stayed in a Monaco suite for the first two nights (comped) on the 30th floor. It was quite nice, 700 sf, but not worth the regular price of over $300 they state on their website. There was no jetted tub as listed on the site, instead a shower only with a seat. There was no ledge on the shower floor to speak of, so it was virtually impossible not to leak water out onto the marble floor. There was also a smaller washroom in the suite with a loo and sink. The larger bathroom was so spacious, we felt it was a suite designed for wheelchair access. What a great idea. Also had a 42\" plasma TV and couch to sit on. Lovely comfortable bed with duvet. We then transferred to a deluxe room on the 10th floor for four nights. We got a special MGM/Mirage players' club rate of $49 per night weeknights and $99 for the Friday. It was a very nice room as well, same as last year so we knew what to expect. No view to speak of - it is difficult to get a really nice view room at the Monte Carlo, unless you like cranes and such. We did not hear any noise from the construction at all, except for a very faint beeping of trucks backing up. No big deal. The housekeeping service was excellent as usual. We requested extra bars of the wonderful shower soap on a note and received lots (we usually leave $4-5 dollars per day for housekeeping if the service is good, and it was). The staff was very friendly at MC. We ate only one meal, a late nighter at The Cafe. Our server, Sharon, was a very nice gal, and the food was quite good. We also had desserts from Starbucks which were very nice. The slots were really tight in Vegas this time around. Last year we managed to win on several machines at MC, but not this time. We saw \"Ka\" at MGM Grand, which was very good. $150 total for two people, about 2/3 the way back from the stage. Cirque de Soleil shows in general are always a good bet for entertainment; some are quite pricey, however. \"Ka\" and \"Mystere\" are quite reasonable. We saw Carrot Top at the Luxor. Very funny guy, kept us laughing. Not for kids under 14, though. $90 total for two. We ate at Joe's Stone Crab Restaurant at Caesar's Palace. Quite pricey, good service; very good filet mignon. The stone crabs take a bit of work to get the meat out of the shell, served cold with a creamy mustard dipping sauce. Sides are big enough for two, so share. New York New York has a nice restaurant, America, with a map on the ceiling that should be seen. It is very well done and fun to look at. The Italian restaurant, Il Fornaio, was quite good. The Tuscany Cafe in Tropicana was much better; it has a dinner special, two lobster tails for $19.95 which is excellent. The Cheesecake Factory at the very far end of the Forum Shops at Caesars is always great - good food, good service and desserts to die for. We tried to get into Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill at Caesar's three times, but no luck. Bette Midler is there until mid December, so it is very difficult to get a reservation at Bobby's. Hope you have better luck than we did. All in all, a great trip; the gambling was brutal, but otherwise Vegas is always fun. Be prepared to walk a lot. Bus pass for 24 hours is $5.00 per person, including transfers. Well worth it, but be prepared for slow going from, say, 3 pm to 7 pm on the Strip. Allow extra time, an extra half hour at least to get to shows and whatnot, otherwise you might be late. The Monorail is much faster, but is $12.00 for 24 hours and stops at the rear of select hotels on the West side of the Strip, then you have to walk through to the street. Monorail runs from the back of MGM Grand at the South end to Sahara on the North - 14 minutes total. If you want to go to Palace Station on Sahara, take the 204 bus. Above all, have fun in Vegas; get used to the construction, it will be there for quite a while. We got used to it pretty quick. Also, check out The Conservatory at the Bellagio if you're going to Vegas soon - it is beautiful with a fall theme of pumpkins, gourds, elves, \"man-eating\" plants, gorgeous flowers and such.

I have stayed at the Luxor and been happy with it, but it is such a looooong walk from the casino to the elevators to your room (if you are in the towers) that you really dread ever having to go back to your room to drop off a shopping bag, or a jacket that you've decided you don't need. Also, the Luxor's casino floor is quite large and sometimes it can be hard to navigate. The Monte Carlo's size and layout is great. You walk out of the casino into the lobby and the elevators are right there, and we never had to wait longer than about 30 seconds for one. I kid you not. It was really nice. The casino is a little smaller than many of the others, and is quite open and well laid out. It is therefore easy to navigate, and if you are looking for someone from your party, it is quite easy to find them. The location of this hotel (right between NYNY and the new City Centre complex that is being built) is a little further removed from the south end of the strip, and for anyone who's been to the strip before, you know that moving 3 or 4 hotels down makes a big difference in walking distance to anywhere else you may want to go. Every property takes up so much real estate, walking the distance of 3 or 4 properties can take you a good half hour, depending on the crowds. We quite enjoyed the Monte Carlo's location, and as to any noise from the construction next door, we did not hear anything. We ate breakfast every day in the Cafe, and every meal was good, and served quickly, by friendly staff. There was only one day we had to wait to be seated, and that was only about a 10 minute wait. All in all, the hotel is a repeat visit in our opinion.

It was $50.00 per night which was a very good rate. Cheaper than the hotel's promos (which were very good since they included extras). The hotel is attractive and has a very traditional look to it. Not a lot of glitter or glitz. The hotel is next to the City Center construction. There is also construction on the other side of the hotel (facing the main entrance). I called ahead and requested a quiet room, which was pretty quiet (I had ear plugs jus in case) and also close to the elevator. The room was clean. Nothing special (sort of like a Holiday Inn) but very comfortable. I stayed last time at Harrah's and this is on par. There's an iron, ironing board and room safe. No coffee maker. The bathroom was in marble and came with only 1 soap at the sink (I had to call for 1 for the tub/shower), shampoo, conditioner and lotion. For some reason they ran out of hand towels. But there were plenty of other size. The tv has basic cable only (not even Lifetime or A&E). A good feature was check-out on the tv. Since I had no extra charges and the room was pre-paid (oddly enough I did not have to give a credit card at check-in for additional charges) I used this and was able to stay in the room until I needed to leave. Since check-out is at 11:00 am it was a big plus. The casino is large and the rock music blares which I find annoying, especially when playing a thinking game, like 21 or video poker. So I did my gaming at other casinos. The hotel lobby is actually a hike to The Strip through the casino. I didn't use any of the hotel restaurants except for some fast food Chinese. There is a McDonald's, Subway, Sbarro's and other fast food facilities in the hotel. The buffet doesn't get high marks, so I went to the ones that do (Paris, Bellagio, Planet Hollywood) which are all about a 10-15 minute walk. Right next door is a 24 hour CVS and across the Strip is a 24 hr Walgreens. Also, across the strip at the Coca-Cola Bottle, is the Tix 4 Tonight 1/2 price booth. Use this one as it's indoors and there's a/c. I got a 1/2 price ticket for Folies Bergere at the Tropicana (about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel). In fact, I walked the entire time I was in Las Vegas. The monorail is just too far away to use (and expensive). The Deuce (Strip bus) is always crowded and you wait forever for everyone to board. I took a shuttle for $6.00 from the airport. We only made to stops before (MGM and New York, New York). To the airport I chose a taxi which ran about $15.00 with tip. To tell the truth, I don't think I'll ever be back to Vegas. The payouts are lousy, the buffets have lost their appeal, the entertainment doesn't seem as plentiful. To come to Vegas just to walk through casino hotels and their malls isn't worth a trip.

What a novel concept!\u201d", "Author": "JodinB", "ReviewID": "UR20685346", "Content": "Alright, you're reading this, meaning you actually care enough about your vacation to do the smallest bit of research. Kudos. I stayed at the Monte Carlo from Sep. 29- Oct. 1st. It was amazing. Here's a run-down of myself and the person I went with: 21 year old males, there to have a good time for their first legal trip to Vegas. The Monte Carlo, though not intentionally, is PERFECT for that. Here are my reasons: 1) Affordability. I paid $60 a night for 2 beds in the lower-middle section of the strip. 2) Faux-luxury. We were very impressed with the decor and quality of the hotel itself. It might not impress a 40 year old who has been to most of Europe. But it certainly made us feel like we were staying someplace luxurious. And that's a great feeling. I want to address some of the most pressing issues that you've been reading about in some of these reviews: noise, quality, value, etc. First off, most of these reviews are really lame. Sorry, just being honest. But why would you complain about the temperature of a desert city, in a review for a hotel?? Of course it's hot in July. Go back to Des Moines, loser. Some of these don't even give an explanation of their bad reviews (read the one a few down that says its \"run like detroit in the 70's\" or something that also makes no sense). This hotel was great. Quick check-in. We asked for a room with a good view and got it without a problem. the pool was fantastic, everything was just great. Some people just have to knock down establishments to make themselves feel better. Weird. Room was good, nothing fancy, though better than most hotels I've stayed in. ONE THING: housekeeping never came. although that was our fault. My friend yelled some things I can't repeat here at them when they knocked on the door at 8 am. whoops. but still. Bathrooms were nice, umm, what else? You're really not in the room that much. You're in Vegas. If you're having a good vacation, that means you are drinking, and not gambling away your child's college tuition. To anyone who complained about the lack of flat screen tv's in the rooms, I hate you. You didnt go on a vacation to watch local news, which is pretty much all you're gonna get on a hotel tv anyway. Go outside fatty. The location: wonderful. close to everything worth seeing. Not a bad walk to The Mirage. Google maps made everything look MUCH more spread out. when you're there, you're probably plastered and you dont even realize you've walked a mile until you're in some hotel wayyy up the strip. I mean that in a fun way. One thing I should mention before I forget, is the noise issue. EVERYONE on here keeps talking about the city center thing. Yes, there is construction. No, you can't hear it. You're drunk anyway. seriously. I guarantee that you'll be drunk if you're in vegas at night. The people that wrote anything saying the noise is unbearable, are the kind of people that just don't want to enjoy anything. Complaining about noise in Las Vegas is like complaining about snow in January. In Canada. ( you know. where it snows. a lot.) Oh, I'm sorry, were you looking for a nice quiet vacation? Go to Palm Springs and have fun doing absolutely nothing. Stop wasting everyone's time by saying it'll ruin your trip. Because you're an idiot. Now, onto another thing that people said wasn't worth it: The Buffet. It owns. Seriously. Admittedly, I was drunk. However, most people in Las Vegas are drinking when they go to eat. It's just part of the strip. It's a big party. The buffet had a mongolian bbq that would cook whatever you fit in a big bowl. Really, that was the selling point for us. We ate mongolian bbq, tacos, sushi, catfish, salmon (maybe? hard to remember), chicken, and a bunch of other stuff. It's small. but everything there was delicious. Go to it. $20, cheaper than most, and worth every penny. We both loved it. When you lose all your money, there is a food court with a McDonald's in it. Dinner for under $5 is pretty sweet. Sooo....I'm getting tired of writing. Feel free to write to me if you have any questions, I'll answer them. The hotel was awesome. Bottom line, stay here if you have a good rate on it. Between the location and the quality of service overall, you won't reget it. You will have a blast, as long as you're not someone who has to complain all the time. In that case, just go kill yourself.

He had the copies of the e-mails in their computer which clearly showed I was to get the 3x play and it did not show any cut off date. He said he did not even know about the cut off date but it would have been set up in the computer so there was no way to fix it.

Let me say that both of my previous stays at the Monte Carlo was exceptional, but this time my experience was quite different. At the end of my previous stay I was approached by one of the Casino Hosts and told that they would like to extend 2-3 nights complementary based on my level of gaming, this offer was good for my next visit to their Resort and Casino. At the end of August we received a promotional offer from the Monte Carlo by e-mail and decided to take them up on the offer and went ahead and booked the trip. The second day during our trip we decided to go and talk to the Casino Host that offered to comp us 2-3 nights for our next visit and was pleased that she not only remembered me by face but also had remembered the offer she had extended, when I told her that I would like to take her up on the offer she pulled up my information on her computer and advised me that she could not honor her offer since we were visiting under a promotion. This seemed kind of strange to me since she specifically stated on my prior trip that her \u201coffer\u201d was based on the level of gaming we had played during that visit. I express that I was disappointed as I was hoping that any comps for the current visit could be used towards taking my wife to some of their dinning establishments. She looked into the level of gaming that we had already played for the 2 days prior to talking with her and she proceeded to comped us 2 nights stay off our bill based on those 2 days. She asked if I planned to maintain the current level of play for the remainder of our trip, I let her know that we have a set daily amount which we spend collectively so the level of gaming would stay very consistent, she replied that any other incidentals such as dinning etc\u2026 would certainly be covered by the Casino and to please see her again before we checkout in order to have those charges taken off our bill, of course this \u201ccomp\u201d would be in relation to our level of gaming. My wife and I enjoyed the rest of our vacation; im big fan of the Blackjack tables but im no high roller in any sense of the word, im not going to get to far into dropping numbers, amounts, wins losses etc\u2026etc\u2026 but I will say that on average I spend about 5 hours per day on Blackjack and my average bet is about $60.00 (any mid range gambler knows how many hands of Blackjack you can go thorough in an hour with a fast dealer). Anyhow, prior to check out I stopped back by the Casino Hosts office and to see what they could do with what was left on my tab and what future comps may have compiled for future visits since I was unable to take advantage of her original offer. She pulled up my information advised me that I had spend $224.00 on miscellaneous incidentals, she then went back to examining my gaming activity, to my surprise she advised me that she had \u201cOVER COMPED ME\u201d when she had taken off 2 nights from my bill earlier on the trip. I know how the comps work and the amount of the 2 nights she comped was less then 10% of what I had spent in the Casino at that point in the vacation, coupled with the fact that $224.00 would be small fraction of comp value even for just one day of gaming between my wife and me. I asked her why she had told me to came back to receive the rest of my \u201ccomp value\u201d prior to check out, she replied that it was her oversight but offered no remedy. Anyone that has visited Las Vegas any number of times will recognize that the Monte Carlo took advantage of my loyalty to their establishment. They are losing a very loyal customer over $224.00, on Blackjack I would lose $224.00 in 4 losing hands within a matter of minutes. Its not the amount of money spend \u2013vs- what should have been comped, it\u2019s a matter of principles, its obvious that the Monte Carlo does not value me as a customer.

However, our room was clearly not vacuumed, there was debris on the desk, one of the bed ruffles was halfway torn off, the windows were filthy and there were sticky pop can rings on the night stand.

When we finally got to bed at about 4am we could hear the people in the room next to us talking. I could make out every word they said. And then there was the construction noise. They must not work on Sundays because we didn't hear anything that morning. And all the construction around the MC made it very unsightly. We ate at the cafe and buffet. Both were a little pricey but very good. There was a wheel you could spin outside the front of the MC where you could win prizes like $10 free play, 2 free drinks, BOGO to the buffet, etc. So that helped a little.

I accepted and we went up to out mid-level suite on the third floor. The room was nice enough, fairly large with a medium sized flat screen tv, sofa, and a tub with jets in the bathroom. We did notice that the lights in the bathroom were not very bright and the tub took about 20 minutes to drain. We spent the first night in this room and were woken up four separate times by people in the hallway. The walls are very thin. When we returned from breakfast, we barely noticed that housekeeping had been there. They did not even make the bed up!!! We called the front desk to complain about the noise, the tub and housekeeping and they moved us to an identical room on the 12th floor. the tub drain was fine and the lights in the bathroom were very bright. Housekeeping was much better after the first night. The walls of this room were just as thin as the first, but there was not much hallway noise - we could hear just about everything happening in the room next to us. There had to be about 6 21 year old girls staying in there, however it was pretty entertaining listening to them get ready and gripe at eachother ; ) We chose the Monte Carlo primarily for the pool. It was good and we never had a problem finding chairs. Expect lots of kiddos. It was hard to enjoy the lazy river for all of the kids splashing and kicking. Also the tubes are ridiculous - they wanted $12 to rent one. The little store by the pool sells smaller ones for $10. The river is so small and short that you con not really enjoy a tube in it, and people who do get the tubes are constantly bumping into you. The water is really cold - about 65 degrees, but it feels great once you get all the way in! There is also a wave pool that is nice, but usually filled to capacity with kids. The adult pool near the entrance is good enough. If you are looking for a great pool on a budget, I recommend the Flamingo over this place hands down. The Casino was nice. Very loud 90's music plays constantly, but it has a good flow and you won't get lost or turned around. We mainly play blackjack - the limits were $5 until about 5:00PM and after that you won't find a table under $10. The food was good. We really only did breakfast here. The buffet is good. Had a great omelet in the cafe one morning and the service at both was the best in the resort. There is also a food court with Sbarro's, Subway, Mickey D's and Starbucks.

The Lance Burton magic show is really worth seeing and the theatre is one of the best in Vegas. We also saw Jersey Boys at The Palazzo (by far the best hotel in Vegas -it puts the Bellagio the Venitian and the Wynns to shame) Jersey Boys is a must see! and Bette Midler at Ceasars and You really can't go wrong with this show -Bette is great and the show girls are the best in town (all 30 of them) Over all the Monte Carlo was a good stay in a good location and the Cafe was a very nice place to eat.

I first have to say that this is a great place to stay if you are going on a budget. Through the help of my research and plane travel of my agent we arrived in Vegas about 4pm local time. After picking up the rental car from Hertz (buy sattelite radio if going to Grand Canyon, possible free upgrade from them, I got it!), we arrived at the hotel and valet parked the car, highly recommended at any property (its free, when you pick up the car give a couple of dollars for tip). By car, the entrance to the property is not directly on the strip, you enter the property from the side before you see the hotel. Once I checked in we received a nice room on the 24th floor with a view of the pool area and construction nearby, a bit more about this later. The room itself was typical for a hotel room and not what I thought a Vegas guestroom would be like. Mind you my last stay was at the Paris which is quoted as a luxury property. It was typical because it had the standard double beds and a regular TV in an armoire versus a flat screen plasma. What I did get to see was a brief view of the suites that were on my floor. This room in particular looked very nice, very much like the photos they use on the website, would like to stay in one of those rooms if I stay again. The pool at the hotel was very nice. It has a regular type pool, wave pool which was a hit with the kids and a lazy river, which will cost you $14 to get a tube to use the lazy river properly. One other thing I found was odd, but again comparing it to the Paris pool, this pool was heated?! which when its 105 degrees I found it not very refreshing. One warning for future travellers to the Monte Carlo. Next door they are building this giant hotel/residences that is owned by MGM and might be casting a shadow over the pool area when the project is completed in 2010, also heard construction noises, but not really annoying. Overall, I would stay there again if I was on a tight budget and could not stay at a property closer to the other hotels action. I found that the Themed properties ie: Paris, Bellagio or Venetian, were more attractive to me for all the glitz and glamour. Prices at the food courts and buffet were really fair priced and well worth it. Avoid the Mexican restaurant in the food court for breakfast, total rip off, would have spent less at Starbucks or McDonalds.Thats all for now and hope this helps anyone :) Have a nice trip", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno, CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Time\u201d", "Author": "BWT02", "ReviewID": "UR17545041", "Content": "Just got back from a weekend blow out at the Monte Carlo.

The new City Center is absolutely the most massive construction project I have ever seen--even by Las Vegas standards. I learned that they work 24 hours around the clock to expedite a project meant to take years, but will be done in another year and a half. I went into this hotel open-minded, having had two glorious stays at Treasure Island in the past. However, the din from construction forced us to pack up and move to another room the next day. We were moved to a much higher floor, facing the mountains--much quieter. The lazy river at the pool was closed most every morning due to the nearby welding from the construction. Every day, there was debris blowing off the construction site (which you could physically reach out and touch, it's that close) that got in our eyes, in the pool (closing down the wave pool) in our drinks, and in our hair. The pool was nice enough though. The rooms were smaller and less 'appointed' than the ones at TI. Our tub (like another client mentioned) never drained when we were showering. I would be standing in about a foot of water (ikkk) by the time I was done showering. The rooms were always very clean and well-kept. The food in the Cafe was always very good, but night after night when we went in to have a sandwich, there would be ONE waiter working many many tables, running ragged. The manager sat one table after another before they would finally have another waiter come on duty. The breakfast buffet was LAME and could not compare to TI's. One thing I will give you is that MC is conveniently located to all the fantastic restaurants in the New York NY mall adjacent to MC. The casino was rather dead every night, even on a busy night. The casino dealers were never chatty or engaging in conversation. Overall, I DID like Monte Carlo for the most part--and there were many many loyal MC repeat guests that we met during our stay.

After we reminded them it was our anniversary, they \"graciously\" agreed to put us in a non-smoking room but oh well, it still had 2 full beds! Wow! That's classy! I'm pretty sure a Holiday Inn Express could be more accomodating than that. Secondly, the pool is REALLY SAD. I am not exaggerating. The lazy river doesn't even move and the pool looks like your typical neighborhood pool --- but even more crowded.

If you do a buffet in Las Vegas, go elsewhere, like the Bellagio. For breakfast the second morning I ordered a belgian waffle at the Monte Carlo cafe. I asked the waitress if it really came with \"real maple syrup\" as stated on the menu. I hate the fake stuff, so really wanted the maple syrup. The waitress assured me (no less than three times) that in fact the syrup was the real thing. Unfortunately when she brought out the syrup it was the typical corn syrup with at most 2% maple syrup. It was horrid. I complained, but the waitress didn't do anything. Why would a restaurant say they have \"real maple syrup\" when they don't? The next day I went to the Bellagio for breakfast, ordered their belgian waffle. Again I asked if they had the \"real maple\" syrup, and the waitress said that they in fact did serve it. Sure enough, they had it -- and I was very pleased. Finally, I was able to get a decent breakfast in Las Vegas! For a good breakfast go somewhere other than Monte Carlo. Also, I am not certain if all the hotels in Las Vegas allow smoking, but be forewarned that you cannot escape indoor cigarette smoke in this hotel/casino.

It looked quite tired and the windows were really dirty from the construction site next door. The glasses in the bathroom were both dirty too. We were willing to overlook these things because we had got a good deal on price. At 5.30am on our first morning, also our wedding anniversary, we were woken up by air horns and loud construction noise. This was really disappointing because we had expressly asked at check in for a quieter room - something the check in girl failed to understand or listen to. At 6am we went to reception to ask for a room change. The check in staff were apologetic and moved us to the 29th floor. The new room was as far from the construction as we could get so was alot quieter. The floor had also been refurbished, possibly after the recent fire, and the room was clean and new. Alot nicer. We did have about 3 of our towels that smelt like a BBQ, possibly also following the recent fire but we stayed for 7 nights so the majority were ok. We were disappointed by the pool area. The wave pool was dirty with crisp packets and a fag end floating along with general grit etc from the building site that surrounds it. Our first day by the pool was a Saturday when the construction is suspended. We visited the pool again on a Monday when approx a third of the pool area was closed until 10.00am because of the construction. We only syated for 1.5 hours because the noise was too loud and we could not relax.

We were allowed to stay at the pool after checking out which was also a bonus and the pool area is really fun with a flowing river pool, a wave pool (cold), a toddlers area and a large hot tub and bars where they sell cocktails. We had a bad experience with the kids. They wanted McDonalds for breakfast and we wanted the buffet, so we sat them at McDonalds to eat while we went to the buffet. Three security guards later escorted them to the buffet because under 16's can't be unsupervised anywhere in the casino area. But when they sat down at the table next to us in an almost empty restaurant, the waitress told us she needed that table and the kids had to stand up while we ate our breakfast. I said to the waitress that I could see 50 empty tables, but she flatly ignored me. There was also an older couple sitting in the enclosed toddler pool smoking without kids. No one stopped them, but if my kids went near the hot tub without me, they were told to get out.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cSomewhat disappointed\u201d", "Author": "WisconsinRidgewalker", "ReviewID": "UR16419639", "Content": "Although I am a frequent vacation traveler, this was my first visit to Vegas.

A new Diablo bar has been built curbside and attached to Monte Carlo to appeal to a younger crowd but the bar which blasts loud music out onto the street not only is annoying, but it obscures the view of Monte Carlo while approaching from the south strip. The hotel is being overshadowed by the construction of the new City Center Complex and construction noise was evident late at night while I tried to sleep. A cement mixing operation has been set up in the parking lot between Monte Carlo & NY NY and is serviced by about 20 cement mixers all day long. It appears the parking garage was also inundated by some construction expansion. The hotel shows no evidence of the fire early this year and was spotless in the lobby, casino & bedroom. The bedrooms are begining to show age as the comforters looked worn and the redwood furniture was showing chips and scratches. Monte Carlo has a 4 star lobby with 2.5 star rooms.

The guests staying at the hotel were super-friendly and very down to earth. The rates were reasonable and I liked the wave pool, the lazy river pool and the outdoor space (though I would say it is not my favorite). On the negative side: CONSTRUCTION - there is a huge amount of construction going on around the hotel (not in the hotel, but on the strip) but as a result, from the pool area you can see all the construction and hear the banging, drilling etc. (also sometimes a bad smell from the welding I think). Also, part of the pool deck are and the lazy river pool was closed till noon on the 1st day because of the construction - which meant about 50 pool side chairs were out of commission. Like most Vegas hotels if you get to the pool after 10am it is almost impossible to get a good pool-side seat, and the towels seemed really cheap. Very poor service on the casino floor - we played several times for 20-30 mins at a time, and never had a waitress come by to offer us cocktails.

However our stay there turned out just fine. Since I had read that you should ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel, I mentioned that to the clerk at check in. He was more than accomidating, upgrading us to a room overlooking the strip. Now - here are the facts: 1. Yes - there is construction taking place on virtually ALL sides of the hotel. But I never found this to be intrusive or overly noisy. I did hear the occassional warning horn blow, but this was no more frequent than hearing the siren of an emergency vehicle going down the strip. 2. Construction around the pool area is a bit of an eyesore - but not intrusive. This is rated one of the nicest pool areas on the strip. It has a normal tropical type pool, with adjoining large hot tub. A kiddie pool. A lazy river (which does move fast). And also a wave pool that I could tell the kids were having a blast in. (Recommend you buy your own tube for the lazy river. They rent for $15 a day.) Drinks at the pool are a bit expensive, but hey, I can blow $20 in the casino in 2 minutes. 3. We had a Deluxe room (normal room) - which was adequate for two people, not real large - and a little short on drawer space. But for us, the room is a place to sleep, shower and -- well, you know the rest. I read reviews about the walls being thin. We did not notice this. Never heard a word from our neighbors, other than the college guys walking through the hall - not a big deal. 4. Great food court with McDonalds, Starbucks, Sabarro Pizza, Haigan-Daiz, ManchuWoc - (excuse the spelling) so good variety. Buffet was better than average, not great - but priced appropriately. Plenty of other restaurants, but we did not try because I was looking for a good steak place. They are opening one soon. Diablos is the newest Mexican margarita bar / restaurant on the premises, and was always crowded. 5. Casino was fine. Not the glitzy glamorous atmosphere that some other people desire - but my wife did like the fact that the slots were spread out more, so people were not on top of each other, like in some other casinos. We walked north on the strip to Caesar's (to see Cher). Because of the construction, I would suggest crossing the street to walk up the strip, otherwise you have a long block of a scaffolded protective tunnel to walk through. Caesar's was a 15 minute walk. All in all - a great place, especially for the money. If you are expecting the glamour of the Wynn or the Venetian / Palacio, then go down the street and pay the $250 to $400 for an equivelent room. I am in Vegas 6 to 8 times a year for conventions - and have stayed in most every hotel on the strip. The Monte Carlo was better than expected. I saw a lot of families with kids, probably because of the great pool facility. Lots of college age and middle age individuals - even some honeymooners.

We chose the Monte Carlo because we rec'd a great deal from casino marketing - $49 a night room, free play, $25 food credit, and two comped tickets to Lance Burton (great show). After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little worried - but we were pleasantly surprised. Although the rooms are smaller than some of the other ones we have stayed in (MGM, Planet Hollywood) the one we had was in good shape and housekeeping kept it exceptionally clean. Bed was comfortable, bathroom OK. TV was a trifle small and channel selection was awful, but we really didn't watch that much. We were on the 6th floor in Tower 3. While it faced the big construction project, we only heard noise if I had the window open. Not much of a view, but unfortunately, that City Center has taken away most of the views from the rooms. All-in-all tho, it was a decent enough room, especially for the price we paid. We ate at the buffet and at the Brew Pub. Buffet was not the greatest and a little over priced. (Spice Market at PH is our personal favorite). The Brew Pub was nice with a decent menu, but again a little pricey for what we had (but, hey, it's Vegas). We did not try any of the other restaurants. I have only nice things to say about the staff. We had an \"invited guest\" check-in and the clerk was very pleasant. The housekeeping staff were very nice, as were the employees in the Buffett and Brew Pub. We did not encounter a single rude, unhappy employee at this hotel, as noted by other reviewers. I was especially impressed by the staff at the Players Club. I experienced a problem with accessing my point play on my players card (highly recommend always signing up for cards). I had to deal with 3 different shift supervisors who were pleasant, accommodating, and just plain nice. They worked with their Tech support people, and the problem was eventually fixed. Those people couldn't have been more pleasant. My problem was minor and they could have blown me off, but they didn't. We really liked the casino. Mostly we play slots. The Monte Carlo has a very good selection for slot players - and we did fairly well in there. The casino is bright, airy and laid out well. It's smaller than most, so you aren't apt to loose your way when walking around. This goes for the resort as a whole. It's a very easy place to navigate, and I especially like the fact you don't have to drag your luggage thru the entire casino just to get to your room. All-in-all we really like this property. You can get some good deals here. We also like the location. We are partial to the casinos at the south end of the strip and the location of the Monte Carlo makes it easy to get to them. The Duece Bus also stops right in front of the hotel so that's nice. We would not hesitate to stay at the MC again and I would recommend this property to anyone wanting a decent place to stay for a decent price. Hey, it's not the Wynn or Bellagio, but then they don't charge those kinds of prices either.

The Monte Carlo casino area is crisp and clean but smoking is allowed in that area. The hotel's buffet was great especially considering the 2-for-1 coupons given to us by those who had visited a promotion earlier in the day. The only thing about Vegas as a whole is that all the casinos seem to have you wait unecessarily in line for buffet seating to be arranged. Plenty of seating would be available and the line could move faster but some are deterred from the eating establishment initially by the lines hanging out pass the doorway. We had a non-smoking king room with effective thermostat controls so that we could enjoy a cool room after a day of walking. The remarks about the bedding was correct - the mattress was absolutely devine. The room was superb for Vegas especially for the less than $100 price per night we obtained via Expedia.

I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never been bothered before as I have many friends who smoke, but this was real bad. I toyed with requesting a room change, but it was already midnight and I was exhausted. I figured I\u2019d make the best of it \u2013 big mistake. Luckily I discovered the next day I could crack the window open and that went a long way in airing out the room. The room also had one of those adjoining room doors and the people next door weren\u2019t very quiet. I realize Vegas is a lot of fun, but must you laugh and talk loudly every night at 2:00 AM?!?!?! Ugh. If possible, do yourself a favor and try and avoid the rooms with an adjoining door. When I went to take a shower the next morning I discovered mold in the shower, water damage on the ceiling and the water in the tub drained very, very s-l-o-w-l-y. Standing in ankle deep, dirty shower water wasn\u2019t very enjoyable. Now you may be asking me why I continued to stay in the room and that\u2019s a good question to ask and my response would be a touch of laziness and a touch of stubbornness, but quite frankly, why should I have had to ask for a new room? Those rooms are virtually inspected on a daily basis and at the very least the mold should have been dealt with almost immediately. A quick spray of bleach would have done the trick. I\u2019m sure the pool area at one time was very nice, but with all the construction going on, it\u2019s a bit of a downer. I hadn\u2019t expected the noise to be too much, but on Easter Sunday all the construction had stopped and what a difference \u2013 clearly the construction noise is a bit loud. In March the sun doesn\u2019t start creeping across the pool area until around 10:45 AM, so depending on your spot, you may be in a shaded area for quite some time. The waitresses came around on a fairly regular basis on Friday, Saturday & Sunday, but they were pretty scarce on Monday. My guess is this will change as the summer crowds increase. As I said, not a horrible time and based on the rate I received it was a relatively cheap trip, but the room fell way short of meeting my expectations.

From the looks of it, they are building one mid-rise building (about 10 floors) out of steel girders and two high-rise buildings (about 40 floors) out of concrete. The construction site is noisy at all hours - it was quiet Easter Sunday, but work began at 2:00 AM Monday morning and did not stop the rest of the time we were at the hotel (we departed Thursday). They appear to be many months from completion. If you are getting a room with a pool view, your room is also facing the construction site and it will be loud. They blast an air horn every time the crane is ready to lift a steel girder. Forklifts that emit that \"truck-backing-up\" beep in both forward and reverse gears unload flatbed trucks just beyond the pool fence. Jackhammers pounding, men attaching things to buildings, concrete trucks, etc. The Monte Carlo's skin and windows do very little to muffle the fervor. I talked to several guests who told me they felt the work is happening \"right outside their window\". Some on the \"non-pool\" side complained of the noise as well. For me, 11 floors above the site was not nearly enough to prevent the suffering. We had our 8 year old son with us, so we spent significant time at the pools. The pool complex is nice and the hotel has done an effective job of using the volume of the outdoor soundtrack to hide most of the construction sounds without drowning out your family's conversations. This is a rather impressive feat as the work site begins at the outside of the pool area's fencing. Unfortunately this fencing is not sufficient to prevent the occasional cloud of wafting dust from the construction site. While noticeable when they happened, it wasn't frequent enough to prevent folks from using the pools (including us). The hotel room windows are quite dirty with what is probably residue from these clouds. If I could do it again, I would choose a different property on the strip.

We both agree we have never enjoyed staying anywhere in the city as much as we did the Monte Carlo. We came early, just after noon and were allowed to check in. We requested a non smoking room with a King bed. The only one ready that early was on the third floor. We were told if we took 2 Queens we cound be on the 13th floor with a view of the strip. We agreed and the room was great. It wasn't as large as some of the rooms at other hotel we have stayed at but certainly all we needed.The house keepers were pleasent and did a good job keeping the room clean. One thing we found odd, the fresh towels were never folded well and were always wrinkled. When we had questions about our players club points, the front desk went out of their way to find the answers by calling the players club. We were comped the four meals we had charged to our room. When we wanted something lighter, it was nice to have the food court at the hotel. The casino was just the right size and not difficult to find your way around. It always smelled so fresh. There was no smoke odour at all. Drinks were offered regularly while playing. We won and we lost but it was nice to play in a nice bright casino instead of dimly lit others we noticed while exploring the strip. What we liked so much about the casino was that it was all one level. You walked in from the street and never had to climb a stair. The elevators were quick and plentiful. We went to the outlet malls on the north and south ends of the strip. We took our fare share of cabs, just because we wern't sure how to get from the strip to others areas to shop, see hotels and attractions. Be aware cab drivers will turn a six dollar ride into a $16.00 fare if you don't tell them the route you want them to take. While on the strip, the Duce bus serves well. It stops directly in front of the Monte Carlo which was great. It costs $5.00 for a 24 hour pass and we found out you can transfer to other buses to go just about anywhere.

For perspective, we are two 22 year-old college students. we didn't see many people our age there (more so at night) - seemed to be many people 45+ and families. We found a promo code at smartervegas.com for $99/night that wasn't on the website, so a good deal! Like the earlier reviewer, when we first got there the lazy river and wavepool were closed. The last two days, they opened up the lazy river, but the wave pool still wasn't open. However, temps were in the low 70's, and when i went in the regular pools I was always COLD, so I think it's reasonable that the wave pool was still closed. THe lazy river isn't very \"lazy\" in that you can go in without a tube, so there were lots of kids splashing and swimming around - you may get wetter than you'd like! Also, because of the building angle/season, the regular pool was in the shade for most of the day -only the lazy river and the hot tub were in the sun. Unfortunately the construction from the CityCenter is right next to the pool, so it's pretty audible. Speaking of construction.... Our room pretty much faced the construction, and yes, you could hear it during the day. However, we weren't really in our room during the day (who would be?!), and at night it never disturbed our sleep or kept us awake. At night there is work being done, but it seems to be minimal (lifting some beams, and only a couple workers that i could say). During the day, yes, it is pretty loud, but who cares? The room itself seemed nice - when we checked in the person double checked with us as to what kind of room we wanted (smoking/non, king/queen beds) and that is exactly what we got when we went up to the room. No, it wasn't perfect - there were some places where wallpaper was peeling, fixtures were tarnished, etc., but hey, it looks a lot nicer than a college dorm room, and nicer than the 2 star hotels i've stayed at. As for food: we ate at the brew pub (had a $25 comp deal w/ our reservation) and that was decent. It is closed mondays/tuesdays. on Wednesdays they have an all you can eat rib special w/ salad and sides, and my partner said it was AMAZING. We also ate at the Cafe which was so-so, but it was open 24 hrs. so we could eat breakfast at 3 in the morning before leaving for our flight. We enjoyed the casino a lot - it was smaller than many of the other big strip hotels, so easier to navigate, but it was still classy (unlike casino royale- scary!!). It was also pretty easy to find $10 tables to play blackjack at... $5 tables could be found early in the day, but got crowded quickly. The location of the hotel itself is great - 15 min. walk approx. to bellagio and the venetian for sight-seeing, and close to some of the \"cheaper\" hotels to gamble and eat at (NYNY, Tropicana, Luxor). *Make sure you sign up for the players club! they had some great deals for new members for pts w/in the first week, and you can use the same card at ALL MGM resorts - which is most of the resorts on the strip. All in all, a good place to stay if you can get a good deal.

She said that unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have a non-smoking, king room ready until 3:00 pm (which is actually their check-in time) but, she did offer some suggestions \u2013 upgrade to a suite or 2 queen beds or smoking room, etc. One of the offers sounded good so we accepted a room on the \u2018Club\u2019 floor. It was a regular, king non-smoking room but for an extra $35/night, we had access to a 24-hour concierge right on the floor and use of the club room which provided snacks and drinks to club guests from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm (alcoholic drinks were served bet. 4:00-8:00 only). For the extra $140 in total, we thought it was well worth it. If this is something you can afford, I would definitely recommend it (once the club room is available again). My husband and I enjoyed talking to new people in the club room while we had our pre-dinner glass of wine and nibbles, not to mention access to bottled water and snacks at any time (this was a huge plus for me personally). The club floor (32) was only accessible by the guests staying on the floor. To access the floor, you had to use your room key in the elevator. The set of elevators (one and only) are close to the lobby and you don\u2019t walk through the casino to get to them. The room itself was a standard hotel room with a high ceiling and larger than normal bathroom that was all in limestone with black granite counter/sink. The toilet worked great; water pressure in the shower/bath was very good and drainage was also good. It was a clean room and looked a bit worn, but in great shape (no scrapes, chips, burn marks, etc.). Bed was clean and fresh with lots of pillows (6?). We overlooked the back of NY NY and freeways. There was a concrete plant directly below which was a bit noisy at times but we always had the window opened so I\u2019m sure that contributed to the noise (didn\u2019t bother us though). The TV was a large flat screen and worked well. We did notice that most of the channels were either news, hotel or \u2018politics\u2019 related. There was a safe in the front closet that worked very well. We had ample drawer space for our clothes. The hotel itself has more of a rich, warm feeling as compared to some of the other \u2018theme\u2019 type hotels, which really appealed to us. And it isn\u2019t huge and hard to maneuver around, again like some of the other big resorts. There were plenty of penny slots to play and some actually kept me going for hours with only spending $20-$30. I would say the only negative thing about the hotel is the buffet. In my opinion, it does not match the rest of the hotel both in atmosphere and cleanliness, but also in service and taste. I would rate it 5 out of 10, at best. We feel that the best buffet we\u2019ve tried in Vegas so far is Bellagio which surprisingly, wasn\u2019t even much more money than the MC ($27.95 vs. $25.95?). We also tried MGM buffet, which I would rate as 6-7 out of 10. We did not try any other eatery at MC (other than Starbucks, which seemed pretty consistent in quality as other Starbucks). About the fire \u2013 I was in the casino when my husband, who had just returned on a bus from the concrete show and saw flames atop the hotel, came up behind me and quietly said there was a fire and that we should leave. He had first tried going up the elevator upon returning to the hotel because he thought I was up in our room but security stopped him and did not allow anyone to go up. After gratefully finding me, we walked out of the hotel while most people were still unaware of anything happening. As we stood outside looking at the fire, it became apparent that the hotel was being evacuated because hoards of people started lining the streets and parking lots. After approx. 2 minutes, guests were being directed into NY NY for further instruction. In my opinion, the crowds were being moved as swiftly and efficiently as possible, considering the circumstances. We were actually going to be checking out that day and flying home to Calgary, Canada but unfortunately had nothing on us but the clothes on our back and our wallets. No passports, phones, clothes \u2013 virtually everything was left in the room. We decided that rather than sticking around, we would go directly to the airport and try to fly home. We knew it was going to take quite some time to sort things out and because our room was located on the very top floor, where the fire was, it would probably take even longer to get anything out. Fortunately, we found an airport shuttle sitting at the MGM hotel (where guests were eventually re-directed to) and managed to make our flight home that afternoon as scheduled (huge thanks to US Airways and Customs for allowing us to fly and get home). Unfortunately, we had to leave behind everything that we took down with us. We are still trying to sort it out with the hotel, but in any case, are very grateful that there wasn\u2019t any tragic loss of life.

From another review, I can see that not everyone had a smooth experience. But everyone in my party walked away from the event unharmed AND impressed with the hotel's ability to work out the logistics of reassigning 3000+ guests. Our first night (pre-fire) I was impressed with the hotel. Some reviews here were very critical of the property so I didn't know what to expect before we checked in. However, our room (a Monaco suite) was large, clean, and well-appointed. My friends who were staying in standard rooms were also satisfied. We were looking forward to a very pleasant three-night stay. Obviously that didn't quite work out! It was true that the hotel was not quick about evacuating. We were among those outside of the hotel who called people inside the building to report the smoke pouring off the roof and to tell them to leave. We heard similar tales from others. What we also heard is that false alarms are fairly common. I assume this contributed to the staff's reticence about moving people out promptly. As it happened, when this occurred we were about to embark on a Hoover Dam tour which took us out of the city for several hours. But our friends who stayed behind kept us posted with regular updates. They were promptly taken to the MGM Grand's Garden Arena, and they were assigned new rooms (at the MGM Signature property) well before 1pm. When we spoke to them at 1:15 they were raving about the quality of their new rooms and about to head out for Margaritas. When we returned to go through the process hours later, we had the benefit of time; whatever glitches they may have had earlier (and my friends had not encountered many) were worked out. They had available for us cell phone chargers (free to take), water, sandwiches, fresh fruit, desserts, a few internet stations, and Red Cross workers galore to help with urgent things. We didn't need anything in particular, so we joined a quick-moving line where the Monte Carlo staff took down some info before directing us to shuttles going to another property. On the street there were two different shuttles available going to different hotels, and we picked the one we wanted to be at and hopped on. Check in at the new place was painless. We did not have our luggage or anything but what we had on our backs. However, we were given an update via a note under our door at the new hotel--yes, our new hotel already had tracked what guests were Monte Carlo refugees--and at 9 pm got a voicemail in our new room with explicit directions about how to catch a shuttle back to the hotel for our stuff. Nothing was damaged or missing, and again the hotel had in a place a well-thought-out system for moving people through and back to their new hotels. A colleague who was on a fire-damaged floor had a longer delay, and one was not allowed to go to her room (on floor 29) but hotel staff packed for her. But we had our stuff by 10 pm. Was it disruptive? Yes. Did we lose some time? Yes. Did we regret that our group ended up in three different hotels? Yes. But all in all, we were impressed with the efficient way our transfer was handled. The hotel management had to swing a lot of people into action and commandeer a lot of shuttles and other resources. They had to contact the dispatchers of every cab company and tour company in the city. They had to find out how many guests could go to which other properties. It must have been a logistic nightmare, but they did it well from my viewpoint. We came into contact with a lot of other \"refugees\" and nearly every one of them was taking it in stride. Many of them had bigger complications than we did (had to delay their departure, had a Monte Carlo wedding planned, etc) but most people seemed to feel well-taken care of, both by Monte Carlo and by the management at other properties. I wouldn't want to go through a hotel fire again, and I wouldn't wish the experience on anyone. But as things stand now I have very few complaints about the way the Monte Carlo handed a difficult situation. I'm so grateful no one was seriously injured, and that this just became a memorable adventure. I would gladly be a guest at the Monte Carlo or any other MGM property again.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, OK", "Title": "\u201cGood Value!\u201d", "Author": "tallchic1", "ReviewID": "UR13071146", "Content": "I just returned home from our second stay at the Monte Carlo.

Friday morning was the fire, so I can't review much of the amenities (and even these may change as the hotel opens), but I needed to add my voice in regards to the hotel's response to the crisis. Yes, we were evacuated, however in short order, every casino's electronic sign on the south end of the strip was modified to tell Monte Carlo guests to report to the MGM Garden Arena to check in. Once there, the guests were fed, and tended to by the Red Cross disaster relief. I know another review here was critical, but I thought the MGM response was adequate. Our needs were taken care of. Efforts were made to assist people who had left medication in their hotel rooms. Most people didn't have the information to answer the questions people had, but it's like that with any disaster scenario. The MGM response was not poor, it was very acceptable. Relocating 5000 individuals is not a \"flip the switch\" action. Around 5pm, we were relocated to the MGM Signature Suites, which was a beautiful all-suite tower a whopping 15 minute walk (all indoors) to the strip. Around 11pm, we got a voicemail from the Monte Carlo staff that floors 3-26 were able to recover their belongings, and that shuttles would be provided to transport us. This took about an hour from the time we boarded the shuttle. Most of this time was traffic in the parking lot, since it obviously wasn't made to handle that sort of throughput. Inside the hotel, the staff was numerous, and everyone had a dedicated function. Retrieving our things went very smoothly, and we signed a paper stating that there was no damage. In the end, we ended up staying at a Suite for the price of the Monte Carlo, all our expenses which were charged to the room in Monte Carlo were comped, and we have a story to tell our friends and someday our children.

I decided not to cancel the booking, however, and I am pleased that I did not. The Monte Carlo has about 3000 rooms in it, and is located on the southern end of the strip. The location is basically unbeatable since it offers easy access to the five hotels south of it (Hooters, MGM Grand, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay) and also great access to hotels just north of it. After suffering through a 1.5 hour shuttle ride back from the airport by a new driver (I highly recommend you take a cab, not a shuttle), we arrived at the Monte Carlo. We were checked in around 2 PM, an hour before the promised check in time. They had about 10 lines open to check customers in and the wait was only around 15 minutes. We booked with the \u201cCHILL\u201d promotion (good until Feb. 1, use promotion code \u201cCHILL\u201d) which gave us 4 free buffets, 2 spa admissions (the gym + sauna/steam room/Jacuzzi) and some free slot play and drinks. The room was very nice, and for the four of us it offered plenty of room. Contrary to the other reviews on the site, the room we stayed in was very clean. The bathroom is also pretty roomy and the water pressure in the shower is excellent. The maid didn\u2019t give us quite enough pillows, towels, cups or shampoo, but after calling down to the front desk at midnight it was promptly brought up. The one main downside of the room was that the bathroom has no fan. So that you don\u2019t stay in the room all day, the TV in the room has only basic cable. You get the Vegas propaganda channel along with about 20 other stations. There is no HBO or other premium stations in the room. The spa at the hotel was very nice and if you want they will give you a tour of it. The cost is 19 dollars for gym use or 22 for gym + sauna/hot tub + shower use. Because we had 2 spa admissions we decided to try out everything they had to offer. We worked out in their very nice gym (weight machines, cardio, free weights), and then showered and used the steam room, dry heat room, Jacuzzi and cold pool. The friendly staff explained everything to us including how long we should ideally stay in each room or pool. They also brought us towels and bottled waters. Even the bathroom in the spa was nice, and they provide disposable razors and shaving cream so that you can shave when you are there. We used the buffet coupons for dinner one night and were very pleased with the selection. The buffet was probably in the upper echelon of the others we encountered in Vegas. On that note, don\u2019t waste your money on the cheap 12 dollar buffets. You really do get what you pay for. The buffet in the Paris hotel was probably the best in town, and I recommend that you get there at about 10:45 and pay the breakfast rate and then stay around as they switch everything over to lunch. This trick works for any of the buffets. Since there isn\u2019t any seating in all of Vegas except for at the slot machines, it is a nice respite from walking to take in a relaxing meal. The Casino in the Monte Carlo was one of the worst of all of them on the strip. Just because you are staying at the hotel doesn\u2019t mean you should waste any of your time at the casino there. The ambience is boring, and the dealers look like they hate their jobs. I played some craps, roulette, and blackjack at the casino but the experience was nothing compared to playing at places like Excalibur or Mandalay Bay. The casino at Monte Carlo is also very small. It is about a quarter of the size of most of the casinos on the strip, and at any given time about 70% of Monte Carlo\u2019s tables lie abandoned since nobody wants to play there. At one end of the casino is the Monte Carlo\u2019s lackluster nightclub/restaurant. Drinks are 8 dollars each and the place looks far less interesting than many of the other upscale lounges on the strip or even in the other casinos. Overall, the Monte Carlo served as a great jumping off point to the bigger and better things to do on the strip. It was a nice place to sleep, very safe, and the concierge and front desk were very helpful. Out in the front of the hotel the staff also can direct you to lines of waiting taxis and limos. I definitely think that almost any group will be completely content with the Monte Carlo, although my recommendation would be to take a hike along the strip and visit other casinos before spending a single dollar of gambling money.

We had originally booked our wedding ceremony & stay at Monte Carlo for 2 weeks in total, back in June 2006, having previously stayed here for New Years Eve 2003/2004 and being impressed with everything to do with the hotel. Only after booking did I happen to look at Trip Advisor, just to browse comments.I was shocked at how many people had given negative reviews because of the nearby construction. I contacted the wedding co-ordinator who advised that there was a lot of construction going on, and it did affect the accomodation side of the hotel, but not the wedding chapel. We decided to keep the wedding here, but reduced accomodation to just 2 nights - the night before & the night of the wedding. For the rest of our stay, we booked Paris. We arrived in Vegas on 3rd May, and headed to Paris (see my seperate review - superb!). As we were in the taxi, I could not believe the extent of the construction work next door to Monte Carlo, and we were so pleased we decided to change hotels for the main part of our stay. There were cranes everywhere, and the area of construction is huge. Accomodation: I checked into Monte Carlo on 7th May, leaving my now husband to stay in Paris - we wanted to keep some wedding traditions, even though it was a Vegas wedding! - check in was very quick, I explained to the receptionist that I was staying & getting married at the hotel, and asked for a good room. I was given a room on the 24th floor, overlooking some of NYNY & MGM Grand. The room was a little tired & basic compared to the fantastic room we had in Paris. Overall it was clean, had 2 king beds, a decent bathroom & storage space. It was quite basic though, and felt like it needed a new carpet & lick of paint. It had lost some of the grandeur of my previous stay. I was given a room with an interconnecting door to the room next door, and although it remained closed I could hear some conversations & general noise, but not too much to stop me sleeping. I felt very safe staying in the hotel by myself even though I went out with friends for dinner & didnt arrive back at the hotel until fairly late. The pool area leaves a lot to be desired - they seemed to have reduced the size since my last stay to accomodate construction work, and you literally had to crawl across sunbeds to get to one in the middle as the rows of beds touched eachother at the foot & head end - you had to get on well with the people sitting near you!!! We could hear everyones conversations as we were sitting so close. To be honest, you may as well be sitting on a building site in your bikini as all you could hear was the noise of trucks, cranes & blocks being dropped or stacked. You also had to move several times to chase the sun - we only sat by the pool from around 9am-12pm, and had to move at least 3 times. The hotel sits on top of the pool so areas get shaded very quickly. In all fairnes though, this was 7 months ago so things may have changed by now. After the wedding, check out was quick & easy and we found staff to be friendly. We did check out very early on the morning of the wedding though as we wanted to get back to Paris which seemed like pure luxury compared to the Monte Carlo. The casino is actually very good - people we travelled with usually went to the MC casino from Paris as they found the dealers friendlier, the atmosphere good & they won more often!! It's handy to have the foodcourt, especially 24hr Starbucks. We ate in Dragon Noodle & used the salon, but more on that in the wedding chapel review. I would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget (rooms are v cheap at the moment) and in Vegas to party, gamble or sight see and wont be in the room much. The location of the hotel is good, but be prepared to get dusty as you walk towards Bellagio due to all the construction work - it was going on next to the MC and also on the opposite side of the Strip at Planet Hollywood so there was always a permanentdust cloud around. I would stay here again if my budget was guiding me, as it's worth it to be in Vegas! I would still rather stay here then further down the strip at Circus Circus/Stratosphere which are only a tiny bit cheaper. Wedding Chapel: This is the GOOD part of the MC! From our very first enquiry until our return to the UK, the service we received was outstanding. Our wedding co-ordinator - Michele - was fantastic, and was happy to promptly answer (lots of!) emails in the run up to the big day. She answered every question, no matter how big or small & was always so friendly. We booked the Tiffany package which covered everything we wanted. The type of flowers I wanted were not listed as part of the package so I emailed a photo of the style I wanted and the florist done a fantastic job of putting these together for us - the florist loved them so much, they have now added them to their package as an option!! On our 2nd day in Vegas we went to the MC to meet with Michele & give her our license & run through the day. It was like meeting an old friend and we knew that we had made the right decision in keeping our ceremony here rather then move it due to construction. She was happy for us to provide our own ceremony music & was so flexible in making the day personal to us with our requirements. The actual chapel is very kitsch and very 'Vegas' but we loved it. The minister was great and made us feel very relaxed and comfortable. The wedding was broadcast live on the internet for absent friends and remained on there for 30 days - I thought at approx $55 this was excellent value. The photographer was ok, but I'm glad that we had booked another photographer (De Simone Photography - highly recommend) to take us on a photo tour of Vegas after the ceremony, as it all felt very rushed and she didnt really ask me who I wanted in which photos and even left my Dad out of 1 family picture, despite me saying several times that he needed to be in it! As soon as the ceremony was over we were given a gift bag which included the wedding on DVD (good quality), champagne & other bits & pieces - this was all included in the Tiffany package. I had a manicure & my hair styled at the Salon in the hotel, and although they done an excellent job & it was exactly as I asked them, I thought it was a little pricey at just under $200 - I only had my hair curled, not put up and a basic manicure. However I couldnt have done a job half as good as they did, and I only get married once! We had our wedding breakfast at the Dragon Noodle restaurant after a few drinks in the Brewery pub - the food was good, but completely lacked atmosphere and this was the 1 thing we would change about the day - it didnt feel 'special' enough. The staff made no reference to the wedding, even though I was sitting there in a dress & veil - they treated us like we were on a normal night out. Our wedding photos were ready to be viewed the next morning and we were able to choose a decent amount as part of the package. Additional photos were expensive but we only bought a few more as we had also been on a photo tour after the ceremony so had lots more from the day. To buy the CD of all photos copyright free, it was over $1500 - this is more than double the cost of the entire ceremony!!!! When you consider that our photo tour which lasted 2 hours in a limo, stopping at all of the main hotels, 100 pictures printed in an album & the CD of all pictures copyright free only cost us $600 in total, I think this was a complete rip off!!! Luckily there were only a few more pictures we loved which we had to buy as extra on top of our package so it wasnt too bad, but if we hadnt had the photo tour then it would have ended up very costly as obviously you want all the memories you can get from your special day. I would give the service received from the chapl 9/10 - it would have been 10/10 if the photographer had not been so rushed & pushy with us, and then so blooming expensive!!! The actual day though got a 11/10, and I dont think we could have been any happier at any of the other main strip hotels - it all went smoothly & without any glitches. Thanks to Michele Barker who made the day so perfect.

Like many others I wasn't sure what to expect after reading some reviews. I almost cancelled before I left as I feared the hotel had really gone down hill.

I decided that if it indeed was bad, I would just stay somewhere else. 2 days before I left I checked availability and rates at other hotels just in case. But it wasn't necessary. I had a very late flight so check in wasn't a problem. Only one person in line in front of me. I was disappointed to find that I was only on the 3rd floor. But it was more important how clean the room was. I didn't even ask for a higher floor. I was impressed when I got off the elevator and saw how spotless the 3rd floor was. I was VERY relieved to find the room clean and in order. Bathroom was a little worn, but the hotel is 10 years old. Still, you would think a hotel with a supposed 4 star rating could afford to put a new faucet in rooms where needed. But it worked so it wasn't a problem. The marble in the bathroom was all shiny and clean. I was pleased with the room. It is funny how people mentioned the sheets are too short for the bed. That was true in my room. But I guess I don't toss and turn much because it didn't bother me. Although the comforter wasn't new, it was not as nasty as some people reported. Since I was on the 3rd floor I didn't have a nice view of anything. Overlooked a roof (parking garage?) and could see the back of the New York New York. But it didn't bother me. Yes there was constuction noise. But I always travel with ear plugs anyway. Sometimes the other people on the floor are more noisy than construction sounds. So earplugs are a staple when I travel. I tried both the Cafe and the Buffet at the Monte Carlo. I had the stuffed French toast one morning in the Cafe and it was excellent. I saw previous reviews that said the buffet was awful. People must be very picky eaters or they shouldn't be eating at buffets. Everything was hot and delicious. I was surprised at the number of options available, American, Mexican, Asian. Salad bar was fresh and desserts plentiful. The casino was larger than I thought it would be. I just play slots and they have a very good selection. I played there almost every day and there was a waitress around the casino all the time, no matter where I played. I never had to wait long for a refill. Their drinks were very generous sizes. I don't smoke but I wasn't bothered by the atmosphere in the casino. I actually won a few, small jackpots there. Not as tight as other casinos. There is an exception to every hotel and I'm sure they have a few rooms that have been neglected. Maybe those maids need to be replaced! Also I think that some people pay $50 a night for a room and expect to get a luxury suite. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay and glad I didn't change it before I left.

After another long wait (3 hours after we arrived), they got a king room ready for us. - There is 24/7 \"City Center\" construction, with the noisy stuff starting at 5 AM sharp. A gravel pit for rocks, sand, and cement trucks has been built behind the hotel. Also, because of the fubar parking situation, if you are on the parking lot side, you will hear taxi & limo horns honking 24/7 (especially if you are in the bottom 10 floors) - Really limited in-room channels. Networks, ESPN, + the Turner channels are about it. Sure, time watching TV in the room is not time spent gambling, but because of our 3-hours worth of room snafus, we missed the entire Ultimate Fighter Finale (which was on Spike) - Someone came into the room while we were out to lunch, and we had the \"do not disturb\" sign up. They did not service the room, just left some promotional flyers around. Did they know we were gone? Would they have come in had we been there sleeping or getting dressed? We had the DND sign up because we had valuables out in the room. - The buffet has gone downhill in quality - think OCB", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "10101 seventh st.", "Title": "\u201cLoved the service, rooms, and resturants\u201d", "Author": "Cathy176", "ReviewID": "UR11486079", "Content": "When I first walked inside the hotel, I knew I was amazed right away.

We arrived late and they did not have a king size bed strip side for us, which is what I requested. Based on other reviews, I did not take a pool side room (based on construction noise), so we took 2 queens on strip side, 16th floor. They said they would hold a King size strip side room for us if we wanted to move the following day. Their key machines were broken, so we had to wait for security to let us into our room and come back later for keys. The room was clean and the view was nice, but we did decide to take them up on the king size since we were staying 4 more nights. After multiple attempts to see if the new room was ready, we finally moved into our new room at about 5:00 PM the next day. Now we had a room on the 31st floor! View was even better, room seemed a little cleaner, and we had more space without the extra bed. We definitely did here horns and beeping from the construction starting at least by 6:00 AM in the mornings - even being high up, strip side. I don't think there are any rooms that wouldn't hear it. Otherwise, no complaints on the room. Restaurants we tried - Diablos, the Cafe, and the Buffett were all good. The buffett was free under the football fan promotion, which was a nice perk. We tried the brew pub for drinks and it was decent. Not a ton of action going on, but to get a quick decent drink, it was fine. We also got a free drink under the promotion. No problems with any of the restaurants we tried. We both used the spa for massage and pedicure and both satisfied with their service. Under their promotion, these services were reduced as well, which was also a nice perk. Casino was quiter than others I've been to, so if you want a lot of 'action', you may think about going elsewhere. They usually had $5 craps tables available, which I used often.

I had read previous reviews on both Tripadvisor and Expedia--so I felt good about my choice. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no system for queing up the customers waiting to check-in. It is a free-for-all, based on whoever has the best luck in picking the shortest and fastest line. We were not one of those lucky people and waited around helplessly whilst other people \"jumped\" in ahead of us. When we did get served, the gentleman helping us was working his last day at the Monte Carlo and proceeded to rant & rave about his future employer: The Venetian. In all his rantings and ravings, he forgot to give us our coupons that were part of our package and also forgot to upgrade our check-out time as he had so dutifully promised. The room itself was quite large for the standard Deluxe room--which is the base size at the Monte Carlo. The bathtub did not drain properly, so when I took a shower, I had the dirty water pooling around my ankles until I had shut the water off. The toiletries are very basic: shampoo, conditioner, body lotion. No shower cap, no shower gel, no extra \"goodies\" that we had seen during our stay at the Hilton in Chicago. On our last night at the hotel, and after having spent 17 hours out at the Grand Canyon, we had the pleasure of being faced with what literally one can describe as a DIRTY bed. The comforter had been changed and replaced with a stained, and ripped one. The blanket underneath was also stained, as were the sheets on the matress and the flat sheet. I had to call housekeeping to get this replaced and we waited a solid 40 minutes before they showed up. The housekeeper who changed our sheets was quite shocked at the condition of the bed. She really did not even attempt at trying to cover it up. On the PLUS SIDE: the people at the concierge and information desk were very helpful. I was also quite pleased to see that they do not charge extra for holding your luggage while you wait for your room or are catching a later flight. The buffet was good too: but be warned that the food was of the highest quality when we ate at 6:30pm as opposed to 9:30pm a few nights before. The staff on the gaming floor are very helpful and quite willing to give pointers. I did not find that the people who worked at the Monte Carlo were snobby or unapproachable. The valet was always more than willing to help my boyfriend and I out in the photo-taking dept.

I preface my review by saying we are both in are early 30's, are not picky people, and are pretty easy to please. This was my fourth time to Vegas and I have stayed at the Excalibur, New York/New York, and the Flamingo in previous stays. When I go to Vegas I look for a cheap room with a good location on the Strip. We are not in our room much so we don't feel we need to spend a lot on a room. I decided to go with the Monte Carlo for this trip since it was under $300 total for the stay and it was in a decent location. Since it met my basic criteria and it got decent reviews I decided to go with it. PROS Location: It is in one of, what I consider, the two major areas of the Strip near MGM, NY/NY, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. It within a short walk to the other major area where the Flamingo, Caesars, Bellagio, etc are located. This hotel probably has the shortest walk to the other major area than the other hotels located nearby. I enjoyed staying at this end since we stayed at the other end last time. It was nice to have the CVS next door as well. Food Options: It has a food court and a variety of restaurants. While we didn't eat at any of restaurants, outside of the new Diablo's, it was nice to have the multiple options if we wanted. We planned on going to the Brew Pub but never made it. We did really like the new Diablo's. They had very good Margaritas, however, they were pricey at $13 for one with decent tequila. The food was good and they have a great location and cool atmosphere. They also have an outside patio and it appears they could open up the large front windows in the warmer weather. View: Our room had the best view of the Strip that I have had and we didn't have to pay extra for it. We were on the 28th floor, facing MGM and New York/New York. With my other stays I never faced the Strip and if you wanted that you had to pay for it. The only thing that would have made it better would be if the casino wasn't located in front of where the rooms are located. So because of that you do see the roof of the casino which is not very nice but overall not a big deal. Construction Noise: There was none. They we not working over the holiday weekend but even when they started again on Mon we never heard anything. CONS Bed: We found the bed to be uncomfortable and we rarely had a good sleep. I thought I could sleep almost anywhere but found it difficult for the first time here. The sheets were like sandpaper and the pillows were terrible. The bottom sheet was not fitted and came un-tucked constantly. I don't think they are ever fitted in a hotel but this is the first time I had ever had it come un-tucked more than once. We woke up to find ourselves sleeping on the bare mattress and the bottom sheet balled up a couple nights. The bedspread on the other bed had a small stain that looked like possible blood or lipstick. This was on the corner where it was not hard to notice so it seemed like they didn't care. Needless to say we did not use that bed and we tore the bedspread off our bed for the entire stay. Bathroom: Not very clean. There was mildew in the corners of the shower and stains around the seal between the tile and the toilet. The shower did have good pressure but the bathroom could use a major overhaul. Hallway noise: Nearby opening doors sounded like it was our room door. A little unerving at first but we learned to lock the door to ease that. So overall, I would say our stay was okay. We enjoyed the location and our view but we would have liked it to be cleaner and to have better beds/sheets. We are not the type to complain so we were able to look past the couple of issues and make the best of it. The room could use a major overhaul but for the money it was about what I expected...although it should have been cleaner. I would consider staying here again only if they remodel their rooms. However, not due to the outdated furniture but due to the cleanliness. Side note: Vegas is getting ridiculous with the timeshare people.

The rooms are clean, the service was great and everything is relativley close to everything - rooms to the lobby, casino, etc - you are not walking miles to get back to your room. We go to Vegas every year and I can honestly say we won't think twice about staying at the Monte Carlo again.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cMonte Carlo - no frills and no thrills\u201d", "Author": "beckymonster", "ReviewID": "UR10839703", "Content": "It was my first time going to Vegas (I went with my family) and we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo.

No better place for it!\u201d", "Author": "tamnrudy", "ReviewID": "UR10599961", "Content": "Vegas TR 10-24 to 10-30, 2007. Long day of travel on the 24th, flew Spirit from Orlando through Detroit to Vegas. Yes, it was out of the way, but I had been concerned about fares and got a bit too anxious about it. Should have waited til Southwest had their fares online. Got to Vegas around 4:00 PM, one of the bags was damaged; one of the front flaps was almost completely ripped off. I think this was due to overloading the carousel which caused the bag to catch on the chute as it went by at the top of the pile. Be that as it may, at least the bag did not rip open. First tip: stand in the Taxi line. Between a LOOONNNGG wait at the curb, plus the stops at other hotels, we could have been through the taxi line and at the Monte Carlo for a couple drinks! Room at Monte Carlo was 16-316. On the back side toward the NYNY. We were not really bothered by construction noise although it could be faintly heard. It was actually kind of interesting to watch the construction. Amazing the organization that has gone into this massive project. Worse than the construction was the horn honking, etc that regular cars made and the LOUD family next door that TALKED SO LOUD and made sure to SLAM THE DOOR every time they left. Room was a clean, non-smoking room with 2 queen beds. Yes, it could use an update; the coverlets and towels were somewhat worn. BUT\u2026housekeeping was a well-oiled machine; we never waited more than 30 minutes before they were done. First night, Irish Car Bombs at 9 Fine Irishmen at NYNY to celebrate our arrival to Sin City. Went down smmooootthh! This was my biggest night gambling. I put 5 bucks in nickel Tabasco slot machine. Played max bets over and over and got it up to $540 bucks. Cashed out when it was down to $322. Pretty sure that will never happen to me again! Was exciting! Next day was a lot of walking and shopping, all the way down to the Fashion Show Mall and beyond it, the Love Boutique. For those who have asked, the Love Boutique is an adult store that is within view of Dillards parking garage of the Fashion Show Mall. An easy and safe walk discounting the traffic. They were well-stocked with clothes mostly and had Halloween costumes discounted. Got back to the Monte Carlo and Rudy (DH) talked to his best pal from high school, who now lives in Vegas, and who was with his wife at the Palms. They drove down to our hotel and we went for a few drinks at the Big Apple Bar at NYNY. Phoenix was OK, a bar band with standard hard rock mostly. Friday was a blur. We joined some slot clubs at the Planet Hollywood, Harrah\u2019s, and the Wynn. Played in each to get the accounts a tiny bit established. Made enough points at the Wynn to Qualify for free buffet (25 points = 1 free buffet) and decided to save those until Monday before Spamalot. Thanks to TA forum poster clarelw for the heads-up on this. Second Tip: If you do this at the Wynn, be aware that you need to see the players card desk to get the buffet added to your card AND you must use the free buffet within 24 hours of it being put into your players card account\u2026.so don\u2019t go do this until the day you want the buffet. Friday evening we went to Rudy\u2019s classmate\u2019s home for hors d\u2019ouvres and some beers. Yakked away til 2 AM, then they drove us back to the Monte. Saturday was spent relaxing before the big event of the Fetish and Fantasy Halloween Ball. Ate at Diablos in front of the Monte; fish tacos were yummy! Got ready and left the hotel at 10PM. The taxi driver was an absolute gem; avoided the Strip traffic which as GRIDLOCK and scooted through the roads around the MGM. Got to the Alexis Park for the Ball in no time at all. Lots of confusion as to standing in line; but we got in a short one. Were inside in about 15 minutes only to find they wanted us to stand in line for drink tickets. Not sure why they changed the procedure from our last time in 2005. The layout was huge and labyrinth-like. There was only one main bathroom area with major long lines\u2026but we did manage to find the \u201csecret\u201d potty that was not marked by signs. No lines there at all. It seemed like folks could not figure out that a big convention center facility had more than one bathroom, drink stand, etc. Anyway, all in all it was a blast. Rudy made the good decision to get us out of there at about 3:45 AM, before the official close. The wait for cab was about 5-7 minutes. We knew from previous experience that at 4:15 AM, it would be an hour or more. Sunday we slept in til noon, then went to the House of Blues in Mandalay Bay for breakfast. YUMMY and the coffee is super good! Decided we were not hung-over (due to eating before the Ball to avoid such a thing; hey it worked! Go figure!) and might even like to see a show that evening. Took the advice of many TA forum folks and visited the Big Coke Bottle by M&Ms World. In keeping with our previous evening, we got tickets ($27.00 pp) to see Fashionistas at Krave (next to the Planet Hollywood complex). Ate at Trader Vic\u2019s in the Miracle Mile shops before the show. Very expensive for such a limited menu, but food was absolutely awesome! Got in line for Fashionistas behind 2 sisters who\u2019d been at the Fetish Ball the night before so we had a lot to talk to them about. Nice girls. We\u2019d bought general admission tix, and ended up in the front row. Cool! The show was very small production, not high budget. But the dancing was excellent and all the performers were obviously highly-trained. Costumes were very, very interesting; we coveted. Though the subject matter might not appeal to some, the dancing was beautiful and artful; with a lot of humor thrown into the mix. Monday was our last hurrah! I had a massage at the Monte Carlo\u2019s spa. Was very nice, but more Swedish than the relaxation type I prefer. The steamroom was lovely and my poor dried out sinuses were in heaven! Next time, I will go back to the Luxor, where I had a wonderful massage a few years ago. And their women\u2019s spa area was really cool. Ah\u2026another trip report that shall be. At MGM, we bought monorail tickets, unlimited one day passes, for the trip to the Wynn and back. Decided to go to the convention center station and take the free Wynn shuttle to the hotel. BAD MISTAKE. The wait for the shuttle was at least 25 minutes, then it took another 20-30 minutes to get to the Wynn due to construction and rush hour traffic. Should have stuck with our original plan of getting off at Harrah\u2019s and walking to the Wynn. Oh well. Can\u2019t change what you can\u2019t change. Next time we will know better; and now you should too! Got our free buffets added to our players cards and went to the restaurant. It was pretty good. The shrimp and sushi were good. Lots of choices and cuisines. Make sure to try the peanut butter cookies on the dessert bar. On to the show! Spamalot was all it has been hyped to be. A total laugh riot and a great production with Vegas glitz, dancing, and fun! We do think it is funnier because we\u2019ve seen all of Monty Python\u2019s movies and shows. If you plan to see it as a play, rent the Holy Grail before you go. Back to the Monte Carlo\u2026Ni Ni Ni\u2026 all the way! Checked in with the players club there and got 2 breakfast buffets and 35 bucks in slot play. Not as good as getting comped a room like we\u2019ve gotten in the past, but pretty good considering we didn\u2019t stay as long or play as much. Tuesday, woke up and packed, called maintenance for some duct tape for the mangled suitcase. The stuff they brought was stronger than duct tape if there can be such a thing. Ended up doing the job as the bags all made it safely back to Orlando. We went down for breakfast, returned to the room to finish up there. Did the checkout with the TV and got downstairs. Taxi stand had a long line, but a shuttle service came by and said they\u2019d go directly to the airport for 5 bucks a person. We went, they did, and we decided that was the only kind of shuttle to take. Got through Southwest ticketing, lines through security were long but not major and they kept moving, and hunkered down to wait for the flight. Despite having Zone C seating, we were able to sit together and enjoyed the trip home, if one can enjoy a long plane ride. Pilots got us to Orlando 20 minutes early and Rudy has decided that SW is back in his good graces. Home by 11 PM, the morning came too early.

The only problem I had was with the pool area. It faces the construction and most of the pool area doesn't get any sun until well after noon. It is a nice pool area, but small. They play music to try and cover the construction noise but you can still kind of hear it. I was able to read a good book and tune most of it out though.

Comfortable beds also. We stayed on floor # 20. Prior to this visit I have stayed at The Mirage, Treasure Island and Tropicana. Monte Carlo is just a small step below Treasure Island (Mirage was the nicest) and the Monte Carlo is 1,000 times better than the Tropicana. That place is a total dump.

We arrived early Monday evening. No bell staff to meet taxis and take your bags off you - not a disaster, but it would have been nice. There were not too many people arriving at this time, but out of around 20 check-in desks, only four were open, and even when you got to the desk, the process seemed incomprehensibly long and drawn-out. From arriving at the front door to walking into the room took about 40 minutes. On the plus side, you did not have to trail through the casino to get to the elevators. At the time of booking, we requested a room away from the construction with one king bed. Away from the major construction we got, the king bed we didn't. Some noise was audible, but it was not really an issue, and certainly not enough to wake me. The room and bathroom were fine, reasonably spacious, and with most amenities, but notably missing a fridge and coffee making facilities. The Monte Carlo is well situated between mid-strip and the nicer south end of the strip, and most casinos are walkable. The south-bound deuce bus stops right outside the door. On a side note, while the deuce is a good idea, sheer weight of traffic, demand and a very inefficient boarding process makes it an incredibly long means of getting anywhere. We used the free buffet coupons. It was okay, but I would not bother paying for it. Despite it being more empty than full, there was still an inexplicable wait for tables. The food was adequate, no more, no less. Service was on the surly side. The Brew Pub is a great little place - both to sit at the bar and to eat (huge and nice burgers), although it was slightly disappointing to learn that they stopped brewing ten months ago - they should perhaps get round to changing the name and the in-house literature. Houdini's Lounge is a nice place for a relatively quiet drink. The casino was fairly dull and lacking in atmosphere, and there were a fair few pretty miserable dealers. Having said that, the guys involved in the craps lessons were very good.

A couple things what future travelers might be interesting to know about this property and up comming Vegas trip: 1. Between Monte Carlo and Bellagio huge MGM City Center construction active. MGM planning to finish this project at the end of 2009. So, if you are planning to travel to Vegas in between this time make sure you book your room away from construction noise. You will face construction all the time. The most annoying was to see all this mass going on right on the other side of the pool. There are no way to avoid it....from one side of the pool hotel and another construction site. If you still ok with that, make a proper request before your arrival. 2. We didn't have any problems with the room, housekeeping service were 24 hours, room were clean all the time. I would not use their hotel shampoo, conditioner or body lotion and will bring my own. By the way in Las Vegas air is a very dry, so make sure to bring good rich moisturizer for your face and body. 3. The most disappointing for me was the Monte Carlo Buffet. I could believe my eyes when I saw the same type of food were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Gosh, you will get tired of it. Of course for breakfast they will have some eggs, pancakes also, but that is all. But Lunch and Dinner were the same, only price was different. Don't waste your money and have a Buffets at the Bellagio and Wynn! 4.Spa has a very small and tiny facility. They saying it's newly renovated, well it's not. It was renovated long time ago. Everything standart inside the Spa, but too small and it was very cold inside. I wouldn'tste my money and will try some other Spas in Vegas like MGM, Bellagio or Wynn. With regards Las Vegas shows, we have seen mostly all of them already. This time around we saw Love, Le Reve and David Copperfield. If you will book one of the show at the Wynn Hotel, with your first ticket purchase they will give you a coupon with 25% discount for another show playing at their hotel, if you will buy tickets withing 7 days. So, keep it in mind. They are playing Monty Spamalot and Le Reve at the Wynn only. Highly recommend to see both of them. With reagards, free credits to play at the casino...if you will assign to the MGM Player card they will give you $10 credit to play. And get ready to this at the Wynn they give $25 credit.-).

The hotel itself is clean, and the lobby, elevators and casino are very accesible. The hotel layout makes it easy to get around and find others in your group. The room is average, not fancy or themed. Just plain and simple. The bathroom shower didn't drain well. Overall, we chose this hotel because the price was right, the location seemed good, as it is on the strip, and we got exactly what we paid for. Don't expect a typical Vegas over the top themed hotel and casino, and you won't be dissappointed. The plus of this hotel is the pool, however, there is alot of construction surrounding this property and noise will be heard. We weren't too bothered by the construction noise because we were up early anyway for breakfast, and were so tired by the time we went to sleep that we tuned out the beeping noises. There is so much construction going on in Vegas that I wonder if it affects guests staying in other hotels, too. On another note, we dined at Andre's in the Monte carlo and truly enjoyed our dinner! The food was tasty and the service was top notch. The Brew Pub, however, did not meet our expectations at all! The food wasn't great, too greasy, and to top it off mu friend found a nail clipping (YES, a nail clipping) in her cocktail, gross. The manager was very appologetic and sincere. The bill was taken care of, and we left without finishing the rest of our meals. That was by far the worst dining experience not only in vegas, but anywhere! We did dine at Shintaro's in the Bellagio(Awesome), The Wynn champagne brunch buffet(wow factor, high quality food and such an assortment of different cuisines, so fresh), The Paris breakfast buffet(reasonably priced, beautiful ambience, good food, liked it so much ate there twice), The Bellagio dinner buffet(overrated, average at best, decor doesn't match rest of hotel). Definatey, do the ATV Valley of Fire tour (Husbands loved it!). Definately visit the Hoover dam, but don't bother with the Ariel tours which offer both the Dam tour then the Ariel tour of Grand Canyon. After our bus dropped us off at the Boulder city airport we were stuck waiting for others to arrive, and sat there for almost 2 hours, no apologies, no idea that this would happen after enjoying the Hoover dam tour. My advice is unless it;s a helicopter tour of the Grand canyon, it's not worht the money or time, because you get the same view from the plane arriving into and departing Las Vegas. The Celine Dion show was amazing and our husbands even enjoyed it. Overall, we saved money by staying at the Monte Carlo Hotel and we were able to do a variety of other things like tours, shows, and fine dining experiences. I would most likely not choose this hotel again, however, because it is not center strip like the Bellagio or Paris where we spent alot of time walking to Next time we visit Vegas we will stay at the Bellagio or The Paris Hotels because we loved the atmospheres both offered, and the dining options are better, more to choose from within own hotel,plus just can't beat that location!", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brookline, MA", "Title": "\u201cClean room & good location; BUT bad service & lacking ambiance\u201d", "Author": "brookl", "ReviewID": "UR10060970", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights recently. Overall we were satisfied with our stay and we'll be okay to return there. But I don't think it's a 4-diamond hotel, and I can understand why it's cheaper than most other higher-end resort/casinos on the Strip. Here's my breakdown... Location -- Monte Carlo is right on the Strip, halfway between Flamingo and Tropicana. I think that is an excellent location. You can easily walk to New York New York and MGM on the south side, Bellagio and Paris on the north. But, if you're planning on using Las Vegas Monorail as a main transport mode, Monte Carlo is really far from the nearest station (allow 20 minutes to walk to either Bally's or MGM station). Hotel Layout -- The hotel building is Y-shaped so that there are 3 sides to the building. One side opens directly out to the Strip, another side faces south, and the third side faces north. As others have noted, there is a construction going on north of the hotel, and the most-affected rooms are on the north-facing side. The Strip-facing side partially faces construction, as well. But we stayed on the Strip side and we weren't affected much at all by the noise. If you're really sensitive to the noise, definitely avoid the north-facing side and maybe also consider avoiding the Strip-facing side. Half of the south-facing side should give you a decent view of the Strip (NYNY, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay, etc). Although I've not stayed on the north-facing side, I think half of the rooms on that side should give you a nice view of the Center Strip (Paris, Belaggio, Caesars, etc) although any view would be beyond the construction and you'd also have to be on a high-enough floor. Room -- The guest room is clean and well-maintained by housekeeping, and sometimes this is all you can ask for in a hotel. The bed sheets were crisp and bath towels felt thick and fresh. The bathroom was clean, with good shower pressure. Nice toiletries, as well. But the room definintely wasn't as luxurious as Mirage or Treasure Island or even MGM Grand. The room's windows were extremely dirty and so it took away from the nice view. Also, they seem to be short on king-size bed guestroom. We checked in fairly early (around 3pm) on a Saturday, and they didn't have a single king-sized bed room left, except on the construction side. Service -- This was the most frustrating part of Monte Carlo. The check-in process was a real pain and took us close to 1.5 hours in total! Saturday 3pm should be the peak check-in time, yet only 5 desks were open and there were at least 5-6 parties lined up for each desk. For a hotel with almost 3000 rooms, this is unacceptable. After about 20 minutes of waiting, our line's check-in desk announced they were closing. So we had to move to the back of another line, and you can imagine our frustration... no staff member cared about how unfair this was. It took almost an hour to check-in. Then we went up to our room and found out our room wasn't ready! Then we were forced to head back down to the lobby and wait once again in a line (this time at a different desk) to get a room change. This took another 20 minutes or so. Also, I felt that some of the staff at the buffet were extremely stand-offish. Food -- We only ate the Food Court and at the Buffet, so can't comment on other restaurants. The Food Court was extremely convenient with decently long hours, and the lineup of Sbarro's, Rubio's, McDonald's, Subway, Manchu-Wok and Starbucks was well-balanced and excellent. The Buffet was disappointing, though. Although they have decent variety, the quality of the food/ingredients was cheap and subpar. I didn't feel too well afterwards. Better off spending a little more and going to Belaggio or Planet Hollywood. And it's also simple things like there only being cheap romaine lettuce (versus mixed fixed greens and arugula at Belaggio) or having only watermelons and melons for fruits (versus pineapples and strawberries at Planet Hollywood). Ambiance/Casino/Kids'Stuff -- This is not a glamorous casino/resort with impressive fountains and gardens and animals. The casino is very sedate and I would even say it's dead after 1am on a weeknight. This place is basically a quiet place to stay in the middle of the Strip. If that's what you're looking for, I think it's a good place. If you want to be in a high-energy, vibrant atmosphere, this place may not cut it for you. All in all, Monte Carlo was good for what we needed and so we won't mind staying there in the future. But there were major issues with the service. If you're looking for a luxurious room, first-rate service, or mind-blowing megaresort experience, you won't find it at Monte Carlo. Also, avoid the north-facing rooms if you're sensitive to the construction noise.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cMonte Carlo - Perfect Size\u201d", "Author": "kupaua", "ReviewID": "UR10060952", "Content": "Flew in from Hawaii and rented a car - knew our room would not be available until the afternoon.

We had requested a strip-view room when booking on their website. When checking in, we asked the very-friendly employee if we would be facing the construction.

The entire 17th floor was non-smoking, which was nice. Never had to wait long for an elevator. We rented a car, and when we parked it around 5-6 pm each night (and then walked or took cabs), we were always lucky enough to find a spot in the surface lot right outside the entrance.

This was a nice cheap hotel, room was very clean, and housekeeping was done with our room by 10 am usually. Always received fresh towels each day, even though we hung them up to follow the \"save water\" program. Ate at the buffet once for breakfast, and liked it. Didn't get around to trying any other of the restaurants, but the food court was super convenient: although the Starbucks was super overpriced. We're used to $3 for two coffees in the morning at our local Tim Horton's, not $6!!!!!! My one and only complaint would be the pool area. Others were right, the lazy river is very cold, and a raft will run you $14 to rent for the day. The entire adult pool area pretty much stays in the shade of the hotel until very late in the afternoon, so if you are a sun worshipper, get down there early, and find a deck chair at the far south west corner of the wave pool, or in front of the cabanas. The chairs are sooooo tight together that you have to climb onto them from the bottom of the chair! Good luck getting any space to walk between them. Only went down to the pool area once. Staff wasn't overly diligent at keeping people with small children out of the adult pool either. (there is a kid's pool, wave pool, lazy river, adult pool and hot tub) Really liked that our rooms were accessible right from the lobby of the hotel. No having to trek through the entire casino to get to the elevators. New York, New York is right next door, and you are pretty central to the strip. I suffered a serious back injury while there on vacation, and we were given use of a wheelchair for the rest of our stay at no extra cost to us, which was a pleasant surprise. I was so worried about this hotel after reading other reviews, and to be honest, it wasn't bad at all. I'd stay there again just for the price. Again, the only issue I had was with the pool area being in the shade most of the day.

We brought our own drinks down in plastic cups, and read a review earlier about buying blow up water tubes at CVS for $5.99 each. Take them down to the pool shop beside the lazy river, and they will gladly blow them up for you. They also have a wave pool, which was ok. There is also another lounge pool, which wasn't busy at all. Rooms: Hallways, and elevators are very clean and quiet. The room was clean, quiet (except the first night when a bunch of people in the next room were noisy all night until 5am, we changed rooms the next day), and had a view of NYNY. They were doing construction outside, but we couldn't hear too much noise (except the beeping noise of equipment at times).

We stayed at the Monte Carlo from September 9-12 2007. Reviews I read prior to going implied that it is a boring place and not fancy or comfortable enough. This was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in, especially for the price (about $60 per night - cheaper than the airport hotel we stayed in the night before we left!). The hotel/casino itself was lovely and in a convenient location. We booked a special through the hotel\u2019s website, then found an even better special on their website 2 days before leaving and re-booked at a better price, saving about $200 by calling the hotel. We arrived at 11am on a Sunday and there was a pretty big line to check in. We checked in and got our room but they said it would not be ready until between 3-5pm. No problem \u2013 we left our bags at the bell desk and used the free buffet coupons that came with our room deal for the Champagne brunch. All you can drink champagne along with the brunch buffet with breakfast, carving station, hot foods, crab legs and shrimp. This is the only buffet we went to in Vegas, but it was definitely good, especially for free! Once we checked into our room it was very nice. King non smoking on the 21st floor at the very end of the hall. We had asked for a view if possible. The only view we had was of the MGM Grand and a little of NYNY but it was ok. The only time I heard construction noise was when I woke up at 4:30am I could hear beeping like a truck reversing. It wouldn\u2019t have woken me up, I just happened to wake up at what would be my normal time back home. A light sleeper might be bothered though. But we were up between 7 and 9am every day and never heard anything else. The pool was really nice. There is an area in full shade which is great for relaxing, but the water stays pretty cold. The wave pool wasn\u2019t working so we didn\u2019t use it until the last day. It is in full sun and much warmer. Too bad there were no waves though. The Lazy River was also fun, even without a tube. We did not hear any construction noise at the pool, which was something I had been worried about, but the view was of construction cranes overhead. Food options at the hotel were very convenient. We ate at the buffet, the brew pub (great service at the bar both times, great sliders!), and used the food court for breakfast at McDonalds and some lunches and late-night snacks. The line-up at Starbucks was crazy in the morning. We liked the Mexican place in the food court. It is nothing special but way better than anything we get in Canada. There is a big new margarita bar and Mexican restaurant opening soon attached to the Monte Carlo, but it was unfortunately not open when we were there. The only problem we had was trying to walk out of the hotel to the North. All the construction has closed off all the North exits so we had to exit on the south side and walk on the street towards Bellagio. The street is not very nice with the construction happening but it wasn\u2019t too bad. It just seemed a lot farther when it was so hot out. We had a great time at this hotel. Maybe people who complain are used to staying in suites at the bigger properties but we liked our room, had great service from everyone we dealt with and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatchewan", "Title": "\u201cMonte Carlo is all about customer satisfaction\u201d", "Author": "alli_han", "ReviewID": "UR8725502", "Content": "The check in was smooth, even though it was busy, as Sunday is their busiest day.

The first room we got 3rd floor with a terrible view of the roof, but we called front desk and they changed us to the 16th floor. They said the room would not be ready until 5 pm but they let us stay in the 3rd floor room until them. The casino was pretty plain compared to the New York New York and MGM, but it was okay. And not too smokey like some of the other casinos. Dragon Noodle was an amazing experience! We called prior to our stay and made arragements with \"Gina\", as we had our wedding supper there. Gina was super helpful and made everything run smooth. She even faxed us menu options and emailed us quite often before the supper. The waitress \"Wing\" was awesome and fast. She was always there to serve us and super friendly. The food came out in a timely manner and just kept coming! Food food and more food. And so reasonably priced! We didn't have time to check out the pool or the fitness area, as Vegas has so much to do and see. We meant to get ot the spa but ended up too busy as well. The cafe was excellent and well priced. The servers pay extra attention to detail and accomodate any request (as I could not have certain things in my food). The conceirge \"Eddie\" was amazing. We had booked our Chapel elsewhere and it ended up to be closed! We went back tot he hotel and spoke with Eddie and he helped us booked another Chapel, which was cheaper, nicer and had limo service for our whole group to and from the Chapel. Eddie also was useful in \"where to go\" and \"the best bang for a buck\". Our room was clean, but internet is not free, which is the same in all Vegas hotels.

We had 12 others stay in other hotels and the only other hotel that was recommended by our friends was the New York New York, which is an affialiated hotel of Monte Carlo. As a tip, make sure to get a member card from the casino and you can use it to gamble at a number of hotels. And charge your meals and stuff to your room and at the end of the stay they will comp you if yu ask.

We left our bags and went shopping, came back around 4pm and the room was ready. The Room was nice and big, clean and had a very comfortable bed. The only complaint was one morning when I had to get up at 4am for an early trip to the Grand Canyon and my shower had only luke warm water..not hot. But the problem was resolved by the next morning. We never heard any construction noise..only the noise of neighbors slamming doors..the room doors are very heavy and slam if you let them close by themselves..We would be nice and not let the door slam..but others..not so much. Also there are no fridges in the rooms which would be a plus. The location of this hotel is great. RIght next to New York New York and MGM and not far from Paris and Bellagio. We walked everywhere.

I don't know how families with kids could stand to be in the casino with all that smoke. Ate dinner once at the buffet and was disappointed by the attentiveness of waitstaff and quality of the food. Had dinner and breakfast at the 24-hour cafe and greatly preferred the cafe over the buffet - good menu variety and reasonable prices. One irritating thing was on two occasions while eating breakfast in the cafe, a loud alarm went off because they were testing the sprinkler systems. The alarm sounded like a tornado warning and was accompanied by flashing strobe lights. The \"test\" lasted for almost 15 minutes and was quite distracting when you're trying to enjoy a quiet breakfast. This happened two days in a row. Played the slots a bit and it appeared part of the casino floor was under construction. Room was clean and up-to-date. Nice big bathroom and great shower pressure.

I sent a written request to the hotel manager about one week before we traveled asking if consideration for something special be made for us since we were celebrating our 30th Anniversary. Now I know the hotels get many special requests, but this was valid. I also took time to write which is more than most people do when they just show up at check-in with requests. #1. There is no parking due to the construction, and we do not valet our rental car but found a spot near the handicapped parking right outside the check-in lobby. I was told at check-in that we could park in the garage at NYNY (it was over 100 degrees that day so was trying to find a shady spot for the car) #2. I asked the clerk at the desk if there was a note in our reservation since I had written to the hotel manager about our stay, and she wasn't interested in being polite or answering my question. Her reply was to hand the room key (card) to me and ask if I wanted anything else. I again asked if there was a request in our reservation, and she no we don't do upgrades (funny I didn't use the word upgrade which further led me to believe she was aware but not interested in assisting us) #3. When we got to the room, it overlooked the construction on the strip for the new City Centre (and I had asked her to please not put us near the construction), and there were several pieces of heavy equipment running which was noisy since the room and windows were not well insulated. This was around 3:30 PM so figured it would quit around 5 or so, but they were still working until it got dark. OK....we were fine with that until it began at 6AM the next morning! #4. As I mentioned above, the building (at least the area we were in) was not insulated well at all, and we could hear people talking and other noises :( from the rooms on either side. Then at 2AM we woke to hear a woman screaming and begging, no, no from a room maybe a floor above us which was very upsetting but were so shocked we didn't call to report it since we weren't even sure where the room was to tell the staff although I did report it the next morning. I also offered to give a statement if security was contacted but to this day we haven't heard anything from the hotel. I assume responsibility since I should have done several things differently such as ask for the manager at check-in, go back to the desk when we got to the room and ask to be moved, and call security at 2AM but honestly as customer, I expected better service and accomodations from that class of hotel.

Low and behold, one bed wasn't made, it smelled like smoke (not the cigarette kind), and we found a used condom and wrapper on the floor next to the unmade bed. It looked and felt as if someone had just used the room and left their evidence behind. I called the front desk immediately and was quickly transferred to a manager who apologized and offered us another room. They sent a bellboy to transfer our luggage and bring us our new keys. He was nice and offered us ladies passes to Tao. Not sure if he was doing that to be nice (they must get these easily) or if it was at the suggestion of management. If it wasn't for the used condom, smoky room, and unmade bed, this would have been a decent stay and my review would have been different. I do have to mention that at that time, the parking situation. We had to park at New York New York, MC didn't have their own parking. An extra star b/c the bed was nice to sleep in and was soft. There should be some sort of cross-checking of the rooms before a guest stays in it. If it was a guest who left that behind, gross, no one cleaned it? If that were the case, you'd expect other things to be in disarray. The bathroom and towels were clean, nothing else was out of order. That leads me to believe that employees had just used it for their pleasure. Literally. I needed to write this b/c I feel the management could have handled this better: a bigger room or comp'd room. As it was, it was almost midnight by the time we got settled and changed to get ready to go out and there was no time to argue. I will definitely stay elsewhere the next time I'm in LV.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cGood but too much noise\u201d", "Author": "mrodrig217", "ReviewID": "UR8497794", "Content": "Lets start by the hotel, liked the hotel in general, staff was very helpfull and the hotel was very elegant inside.

We learned that if a guest were to complain about all the noise, the Hotel would take the guest to another one of their properties. I can't verify this because we didn't try. The entry on the main Strip was covered with construction dust, and was barren of so much as a plant container to enhance the beauty of the architecture.

Aaron is a hoot, Bob is the most patient dealer I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Every employee I've met in their Poker Room has been friendly and helpful to players. They're nice people. The downside: terrible payout structure for the sit-n-goes, and ring games don't get going there until after the 9:00 am tournament starts breaking up. THE PROBLEMS: We've stayed at this hotel several times over the years, but if I were to ever go back at all, it wouldn't be until after 2009 - the projected date of construction completion. There is construction going on inside of the casino as well as next door. The constant sounds of jackhammers and machinery are overwhelming and will wake you up well before sunrise - bring your earplugs. A large portion of slot machines were unplugged for the renovations that are going on. The slots are really tight here anyway, and I've never had any luck playing them. THE LIGHT IS SEEN: My spouse and I have been to Vegas several times, but I decided on this last trip that I won't be going back. It really is just a filthy, loud, overcrowded city - garbage is everywhere and the stench from the sidewalks is disgusting. I can't believe that so many parents actually bring their children here. We had to walk around drunks who were passed out on the sidewalk - and that was during daylight hours. Pornography flyers are everywhere - they litter the sidewalks. Kids are seeing this stuff - parents - please don't bring your children to Vegas. The amount of filth and waste here is mind-blowing.

I had stayed at the Luxor on a previous visit to Las Vegas and although I ranked them both as a 4/5 I wish I could have ranked this hotel as a 4.5/5 as it was just a bit better than the Luxor . Pros for this property include: -A very comfortable bed (perhaps I could be biased as I retired to bed each night completely exhausted from a night of clubbing). -Elegant and clean lobby. The Monte Carlo lobby is pretty upscale in appearance with no novelty decor (ie. gold lions or stone statues) -The pool area was equipped with wave pool, lazy river and plenty of sun loungers -Handy food court with McDonalds, Starbucks (coffee that weekend was key!!!) Subway, Hagen Daas, and Sbarro -Relatively less busy casino (although I wasn't very lucky there still a 'pro') Cons for this property: -Check in. Although the front lobby is equipped for atleast 8-10 service people the hotel felt it only necessary to open up 3 windows even though there was a huge line of guests waiting to be checked in. Check in time was about 20 minutes! -Front Entrance. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and our cab driver admitted that many drivers believe this property has one of the more poorly designed driveways. After being at a full stop in the driveway for 15 minutes I understood what he meant. -We called down to the front desk for more towels and did not recieve them that morning (when they were needed.) To be fair we did eventually get them but it must have been later in the afternoon. We found it a better strategy to just find the housekeeping staff out in the hall and get extra towels from them Despite some of the negatives mentioned I would gladly return to this hotel if the price was right and would definately recommend it to friends. With regard to Las Vegas type tips I learned on this stay: -Tao Nightclub at Venitian is Overrated!!! Went on a Friday night and it was really busy and crowded. I think I got my foot stepped on 3-4 times just trying to reach the bathroom which by way had a a wait time of about 15-20 minutes. Enjoyed Rain at the Palms much more -Don't take the Trolley to the outlet mall on the north end of the strip (the one closer to Downtown). Spent many wasted minutes waiting for the transfer Trolleys. Just take a cab. -Wynn Buffet is the best buffet I've been to in Vegas.

Our room was not particularly clean, although at that point we were just glad to be able to sit down and relax a little rather than sitting in the lobby.

The pool area was perfect for the kids and my parents with the lazy river and wave pool. Yes, it did get crowded at times but it is Vegas in the summer in 116 degree heat! Great pools! They area was much smaller than Mandalay Bay but we were looking for smaller scale. Yes, there were allot of kids but the hotel did a good job of keeping them out of the adult areas. There was a food court right by the hotel elevators, lobby, and pool area. Everything was in one central location which made for minimal walking. The casino was not huge but that was what we were looking for. We have stayed at the MGM, Tropicana, Bally's, Flamingo, and Golden Nugget before...and this one ranked as one of the best trips yet. The MGM is just too big! Construction was found everywhere on the strip from the Monte Carlo to the Wynn. The Duece was a great way to travel but at night it was super crowded and at times would not take people on as it was full (my parents were turned down by 4 busses before they decided to walk back from TI-try that on with new knees). As for the noise, we requested a strip view room away from the construction and go it (we did this with our reservations). No extra fee was added! Awesome room and beds! I rarely sleep the first night in a new hotel and did even without earplugs. The rooms were elegant but not overly done. Yes, a coffee maker would have been nice but to find one in your room is rare on the strip.

I had this review posted originally on another side but decided to put it here. Anyway here it goes. My girlfriend booked the hotel and we got $79.00 a night but the weekend nights were higher. We split the bill and it was reasonable. When I walked in I noticed this hotel was elegant and had a nice marble lobby and check in was not much of a hassle compared with shuttling from McCarran Airport. It has a fountain and statues out front. The valet parking is on the side of the building across from New York New York. Once we found our floor (floor 19) we noticed large amounts of young Japanese kids smoking on the elevator and all over the place. We originally booked the hotel way in advance and asked for a non-smoking floor and room. I had to go down to the lobby and request security and told them I wanted another room immediately as I work for the State Smokers Quitline. They put us in another room on the 22nd floor for the first night. This was too small and not laid out very well. They finally put us in another room on the 23rd floor that Monday night and that was fine. The furniture in the room is very nice and has a dark cherry finish on it. There is a table with a chair, lamp and large mirror above it. The window looked out on the monorail below it and the parking lot. There is a big dresser with the normal TV inside the two doors. The wallpaper is a tan color and was very nice. The bathroom was very nice with a lot of marble. The room has your standard amenities but the iron did not work after two days but housekeeping delivered one soon enough. This casino is located near the end of the Las Vegas strip. One thing I noticed was that it seemed to cater to an older crowd and is not overly large compared with many of the newer hotels. Logistically everything is very close and it is easy to get around the hotel and casino. I don\u2019t really gamble and go to visit friends in Las Vegas but I have heard it is an easy casino to navigate through. It is pretty quiet considering you are next to New York New York and Excalibur. The location made it easy to visit Mandalay Bay, MGM, and the other hotels in the nearby vicinity. Monte Carlo's has the standard shops that all the casinos have. They call it \"Street of Dreams\" It is on the ground floor to the right of the lobby desk. It seems everything is high priced and to me looks like any other street of shops in the hotels in Las Vegas. They have the Monte Carlo Pub and Brewery which reminded me of a place that is here in Rochester. It seemed to have a sports bar theme and really did not look that interesting. It also seemed focused towards a drinking crowd and was very loud. At the time if you kept walking there is a monorail station with electric monorail service to the nearby Bellagio Hotel. I was told this eventually would be connected to the train on the other side of the strip and then to the airport to combat the increased traffic Las Vegas is experiencing. It was a short wait. At the time I was staying at the Monte Carlo the monorail was working but last year it was closed due to construction of the new \u201ccity\u201d next door. I really liked this monorail because you could cut over to the Bellagio and walk right to Ceasers and you could knock almost half the time off the trip because of the monorail. As for the food in the hotel my girlfriend and I just ate at the Buffet once. We opted for snacks at the McDonalds at the time. There is also a French restaurant, Andre's and an Asian restaurant, The Dragon Noodle. Most of these required a reservation and we did not bother because we were out and about all the time we were there visiting people. I have read the Monte Carlo has a great pool area but we did not utilize it. Sorry I could not comment on it. They have a business office which was very nice where we got internet access. For a present I called the floral shop to get a dozen roses for my girl and they were great. The vase the flowers came in was so large we had to ship it back separately. The hotel is very nice and does not have all the external stimulation some of the hotels have. It seems a little more conservative which is fine. My only complaint is that the security could have been a little tighter. Stay at the Monte Carlo.

The City Center construction *is* obtrusive at the pool and made it hard to relax there even though music was playing loudly to cover it up. Plus the sun isn't really abundant at the pool...but children are...we didn't spend much time there for this reason (too much construction noise and lots of kids...BTW, we don't have children so we personally prefer to not spend our vacation being splashed on by other people's kids -- the resort is very family friendly though, so if you are traveling with the children, you should be happy here and feel very welcomed! Therefore, don't register this as a negative if you are traveling to Vegas with kids -- they'll love it and you'll be comfortable!) The construction noise and lack of sun at the pool however, is our only complaint. Our sincere suggestion is to couples in particular: UPGRADE -- and make sure it is strip side! We never noticed the construction noise from our room - we loved the room. The food court is nice and the location of the MC overall is a *huge* plus. Close to so much! The MC does not have the foot traffic of tourists coming through it like the other resorts nearby on the strip...you can visit great spots on the strip that are nearby and return to MC with a relaxing atmosphere and not get that \"overcrowded\" feeling. We had a great stay and would stay there again. Played hours upon hours of blackjack there- friendly dealers and $10 tables. Mostly, we loved the location. As for food, the buffet isn't remarkable. It's nice to go to McDonald's or Sbarro's though to grab a quick bite to eat without paying a lot of $. If you are going to Vegas on a budget - stay here! You'll have a great time in a good location! BTW, we played enough blackjack that MC comped our deluxe room on the last night...everyone was friendly, resort was clean...a good stay overall. If you want Vegas luxury, stay elsewhere. If you want fun and good value in a good location that's easy access to plenty of hot spots on the strip, stay at the Monte. You'll spend less on your room (and have more $ to spend on gambling, food, shows, etc.) and you'll still enjoy your stay at the resort!", "Date": "August 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cMonte Carlo -the good and bad\u201d", "Author": "jodaly", "ReviewID": "UR8362896", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Monte Carlo in the beginning of July as an end to a 11 day trip through Wyoming and Utah. We were very excited to spend the last few days in Vegas because we were looking forward to relaxing at the pool and having cocktails. ( we were just hiking for 10 days in over 100 degrees weather) I have been to Vegas before and we did book the Monte Carlo because it was in our price range. We had read the reviews about the pool being too small and all the construction going on so we were a little hesitant. We found the actual hotel to be fine. Clean, good location, not too big so it was easy to get to the room. Plus, the pub in the hotel was very cool. Check in was fine and our room was nice. Yes, you can tell a renovation is in order soon but we were fine. As long as it was clean and comfortable, we were happy. It wasn't the Bellagio but like I said we knew what we were getting ourselves into. The most dissapointing part of this hotel is the pool for sure. Not only was it packed but with screaming drunk people who were extremely annoying!! I have been to crowded pools before but this was on the verge of disgusting. You couldnt even get a spot in any of the three poolswithout bumping into someone or havinga kid splash water in your face. The chairs are so close together that once you are laying down good luck getting up without tripping over someone. The wave pool is a joke. SO small and UNRELAXING because you are bumping into everyone and many people dont use tubes so you have kids swimming under you. The pool area also smelled like sewage, possibly due to the nearby construction site, which was an eye sore yes but didnt bother us noise wise or anything. Overall, I would have spent an extra 100 or so had I known and stayed at any other hotel with a better , cleaner and BIGGER pool area. I guess it was our fault for booking this hotel in July when everyone and anyone wants to be swimming(especially during a heatwave, yes it was 120 degrees during the days)! I would stay again if I was not planning on going to the pool but I would def book another hotel in Vegas and pay a little more if I am planning on going to the pool.

The construction at this hotel is unbearable, you have to drive through it just to get to the valet. Our so called \"suite\" was ugly with filthy carpets, I did not want to walk barefoot. There was an OPEN utility closet in the bathroom that probably had mice walking around in there. We had to call maintenance to seal it shut. We were very excited to see that they had a dvd player for our kids but it was totally unplugged and not hooked up to the tv at all. Another call to maintenance. This room only had an armoire, no proper closet which was annoying. The room itself was very old looking with furniture that looked old and dingy. The electric closing curtain broke halfway down in the middle of the night and luckily we had an adjoining room so we all slept in that room so we were not awakened too early by the sun. The restaurant was totally overpriced and just okay. The players club system was down most of the day and some of the night so I could not get my freeplay which was most of the reason we left the Mirage for this crappy hotel. The staff including the VIP staff were not helpful and I would almost say rude when I called. We took our kids swimming because we heard they had a wave pool. The wave pool was okay but so overcrowded our kids did not want to be in it. The entire pool area was waaaaay too crowded for my taste. The regular pool was too deep and very small.

We got our rooms for $79 - $89 per night for 4 nights and also 4 free buffet coupons. For the price, this is a really nice hotel. The rooms, as you can see from other peoples pics are tastefully decorated, but plain. We loved the Brew Pub. Great food (especially the nachos), and good live entertainment at night. The only problems we encountered was that our room wasn't always as cold as we would like it (when it was 110 degrees out) and the maids were out of wash cloths for 2 days straight, and the casino was 1/2 blocked off to change carpet in several areas. The hotel and casino was very easy to get around in. Not huge like some of the Vegas hotel/casinos. The breakfast buffett was good, had omlett stations and a nice variety. Casino wise, even with the construction, we could almost always find a $5 or $10 blackjack table (not always easy on the strip anymore). Comps aren't as good as we have had at Mirage, Mandalay Bay, or Aladdin (planet hollywood now). My husband plays alot of blackjack, and we usually get all of our food charged to room comped and sometimes a night or 2 of hotel. This time we only got about $100 of food comped (better than nothing I guess). Just about our favorite day was spent at the pool. We rented a pool cabana ($150 during the week, $200 on weekends). They only have 8 of them, so they are kinda hard to get. You can call up to 30 days ahead to put your name on the list, and they call your room the morning of to let you know if you got one. We did, and it was the best day ever! The pool area has a small lazy river and a wave pool, plus a couple of other little pools. We had cabana #8 by the lazy river. It was sort of secluded. We had a party of 7 and we fit perfectly. There were 4 nice lounge chairs with thick cusions on them. inside was a love seat and a couple of chairs also padded and a coffee table and side table. There was a phone, tv, fridge, and misters. The fridge was stocked with water and various soft drinks. They also brought us a fruit tray. We had plenty of room to pull a couple of regular (non-padded) lounge chairs around. We had a cabana attendent who would bring us drinks and food (which costs extra). We got a couple of frozen drinks ($8.25 each) and a burger and club sandwich for lunch (around $11 or $12 each, came with fries). The rest of the time we drank the included soft drinks and they actually let us bring in our own beer (as long as it isn't in glass bottles). We brought little soft sided coolers and filled with ice from hotel, then there is a liquor store across the street which we stocked up on beer. It would have been very expensiive for our group to drink all day by the pool if we hadn't brought our own. There is also a CVS right next to Monte Carlo which was very convient to stock up on snacks and soda for the room. They don't sell alcohol though. That's about all on the hotel.

Our visit was June 16-21. All the planets and grandparents had to line up to make this work and it finally did. I must say I was terribly concerned with all the comments about the construction going on. The last thing I wanted without kids in tow was excess noise. I was searching the internet the week before the trip with serious concerns about the noise. Finally I decided so many people complain about such petty things here that I would give it a chance and if things weren't acceptable we would change. All other hotels I checked would have been $300-400 more for our stay. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 11 pm on Saturday night and had no problem checking in. I read numerous reviews or people who had nightmare stories about their check in. I think this is simply a roll of the dice. There were numerous times I was in the lobby and there were no lines and other times it was packed. All the employees we came in contact with were very helpful and friendly. Upon arrival in our room I looked out the window and saw a cement yard for the construction site. We were not overlooking the strip so I called the front desk and inquired about a better view. The front desk said the noise from construction would be much worse on the front side. We decided to stay put. Glad we did as I hardly heard any construction noise. We ate breakfast nearly every morning at the buffet. We made it through the line (when there was one) quickly. The food was good. Towards the end of the stay I was getting a little tired of the buffet so we checked the menu at the Cafe. It was going to end up being more $ than the buffet so we stuck with it. Our room was clean and no major problems we couldn't deal with. Some people have complained about any little thing. I do have a stain or two on my carpet at home so I'm not complaining about a little stain on the carpet in our room. I guess I felt right at home ;) We did eat some great meals outside of the Monte Carlo. We ate at Smith and Wolensky across the street from the hotel. Glad we had a $100 gift card because it was rather pricey. With tip we ended up at about $200 total. The food and service were great but not $200 great. We also at at two restaurants in the Venetian. Ate at Wolfgand Puck's restaurant there and had a Asian type salad and a pizza which was an excellent lunch. We split the pizza and the salad and I'm glad we did. There was plenty of food. also ate at Canaletto in the Venetian and it was without a doubt the best meal we had and the price was excellent. Could we hear the construction at the pool? Most of the time no. The music was always on so the construction noise was never irritating. The construction noise was there but it never distracted me from drinking a strawberry daquiri and looking at my hot wife ;) . The pool was a bit small and the kids were out in full force on the lazy river. If you are not a kid friendly person and you will be spending all day at the pool find another hotel. We have two teenagers and a 3 year old and although we were taking a break from the kids the only bother was some kids playing keep away with a ball in the lazy river. A few times I actually thought my wife was going to grab a kid and give them a hug. She was missing the 3 year old. If you are going to use the lazy river you may want to go next door to the CVS and get a tube for 5.99. I think rental of a tube there was over $12. Maybe even $15. We shop CVS at home so it was really convenient to have it right next door. One other non Monte Carlo related comment. The last night we were there we decided to attend the Zumanity show next door at New York New York. Don't waste your money. I am a typical easily excited male and my wife is a fairly open minded female. SAVE your money! Besides the comedy the entertainment value was minimal. If you really want to see a Cirque show I would check out one of the others. If you really want to see some T&A there has to be a better place for the money. I, the male, was seriously dissapointed. Well, I think I have covered everything. If I haven't just drop me an email and I'll give you my opinion. C.

My tub had a slow drain so I called the desk and a mechanic was at my door within ten minutes and the problem fixed. Also, I am a late sleeper and am used to not having my room serviced after 2pm. At Monte Carlo, they respect the \"Privacy Please\" signs but react quickly once it's taken off the doorknob. My room was clean and fresh when I arrived back around 6pm each day after attending a business conference. In addition, the beds were very comfortable with nice sheets. My only complaint with the room was that the walls are very thin. I could hear VERBATIM the conversation in the room next door (and it was a honeymoon couple, so you can imagine!...) as well as hallway noise. The casino is large enough to offer many popular games, but it is better laid-out than many in Vegas. No wandering down hallways or off into different \"wings.\" It's all very straight-forward and easy to follow. Drink service is quick and regular. The pool area is nice, but small. They have the usual tightly-packed chairs around the pool and you need to get there either very early or very late to score one right by the water. The chairs closest to the entrance are best as they have comfy cushions...practically a novelty in Vegas unless you're willing to pay a Cabana fee. The spa is very small...just one hot tub, one cold plunge, small steam room and sauna. I wouldn't pay for it as a stand-alone service, but it is free with a treatment. The location is just so-so. It's not quite in the center of the Strip and just out of the \"South Strip\" bounds. You'll have a fairly long walk to get to the Bellagio area, but NYNY is close. If you walk all the way through NYNY you can use the bridge to Excalibur to access a free tram to Luxor and Mandalay. MGM Grand is also within easy walking distance (across the street from NYNY). Luckily, we had rented a car so this wasn't a problem. If you do so, be prepared...the self-park area at Monte Carlo is hard to find and small.

We were able to get a good upgrade for a great price at our last stay, but the options were a bit more expensive this time so we chose to save the money. We still love the casino there. It is clean and a little less smoky than others. The food options are good as well. We enjoyed the Sunday brunch at their buffet \u2013 the selection was huge and delicious. The pub had great food, but they no longer brew their own beer. The food court has been expanded and they now have a Starbucks. The first disappointment we had involved the construction which has been mentioned in other reviews. There used to be an empty lot next to the hotel. It is now being developed into a massive condo resort. As a result the free tram that ran from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio has been removed. This was so convenient at our last stay. We had taken it up to see the fountains numerous times. Now you have to walk along the street to get up to the hotels that are more in the middle of the strip.

This, of course, is not the Monte Carlo\u2019s fault, but it does make the location of this hotel less convenient. The first couple of nights we didn\u2019t notice construction noise even though our room was on the side overlooking it. You could occasionally hear the beep of machines in reverse, but it didn\u2019t affect our sleep. However, on our last morning at 7am we heard the repetitive pounding of a drill/hammer type machine. It was awful and kept us awake. We were just glad that particular noise didn\u2019t occur every morning. In summary, we like the Monte Carlo, however, we both agree that we won\u2019t choose to stay there again until the large construction project is completed, supposedly 2009. If you are set to stay there, don\u2019t be too worried just try to request a room on the opposite side of the hotel. The noise will probably be less there. The Monte Carlo is a great hotel and casino for a great value. It is just unfortunate that all the construction is affecting the comfort level at the current time.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach", "Title": "\u201c24 Hour Construction Next Door\u201d", "Author": "NEWPORTGUY", "ReviewID": "UR7752882", "Content": "The rate I got for a Friday night seemed too good to be true - and it was.

And would add that the 24 hr Cafe serves excellent food at very reasonable prices. However, acw38's stay at the hotel included some of the Memorial Day holiday period when work on the builiding site, which is at the rear of the hotel and stretches as far as the Bellagio, ceased at 3pm on the 25th. Unfortunately for us, it recommenced at 5am on Tuesday 29th ! And continues unabated all day and all night - 24/7 !! We have had 4 completely sleepless nights. Make no mistake, this is a mammoth development comprising of hotels, retail shopping, parking facilities, office space, etc, etc. It reputely is costing 2.5 times the cost of the Wynn Hotel, and will not be completed for another 18-24 mths. There are pile-drivers, hydraulic drills, cement vehicles, excavators, in operational use continuously. All vehicular movments around the site are accompanied by continuous safety warning bleeps which especially pierce the midnight air whilst you try to sleep. We counted 10 huge cranes moving material round the site. In some areas of the swimming pool the amplified music could not be heard above the noise from the building site and building dust could be seen blowing across the pool area and its guests. acw38 is correct, the Strip is like a building site at the moment, but the development around the Monte Carlo is by far the most extensive. The staff do what they can to move people into different rooms (when/if they complain) but there is a limit to the number of people they can relocate because this development currently impacts on the majority of rooms. Therefore, someone has to be placed in the vast number of rooms worst affected. No apology was offered to us about the disruption caused either before we were given the room or on vacating it. Neither was any prior warning given before we were allocated a room overlooking the building site.

I called about a week after I made the reservations. I made sure that the room was non-smoking and that there was a place for us to park. They re-assured me on both issues....Well, when we arrived, we parked what felt like a mile away and had to lug our bags (4 bags only 1 with wheels) all the way to the hotel. We checked in pretty quick and went up to our room and immediately smelled that we were on a smoking floor. My boyfriend is really sensitive to cigarette smoke (bloody noses), so I called and asked if I reserved a non-smoking room. They said I did but that they aren't garanteed, and sent me up and \"Ozone Machine\" which worked for a few hours. We woke up a few times in the middle of the night to the smell of cigarette. The next day, we had to move the car (it was parked in the City center lot). We had to move it 3 times because the parking attendant guy kept telling us to move it. we also went to get our room change and complain to the manager. She told us that non smoking rooms are given to the first that arrive, so if someone showed up a day before me with no reservations. they were given my non smoking room. Even though I had reservations!!! She said she would make up the inconvenience by putting us in a suite. So we were happy, came back 3 times to see if our new room was available (by now 1/2 of our only day was wasted). When we finally changed rooms, the room was not a suite, it felt smaller than the first but amazingly had a view of the strip. For $350 for 2 nights I expect more than this.

Now for the negatives: shower would not drain properly; valet parking is a nightmare (plan on at LEAST 15 minutes in or out); they charge for EVERYTHING ($5 minimum for Internet access in the lobby, $12 EACH to rent flotation tubes for the \"lazy river\", nearly $3 for a tube of Chapstick that usually costs 70 cents). There is also a fair amount of construction noise from a project being built nearby (however, it's not the hotel's fault). If you are a light sleeper you will have problems.

I have done reviews on it before but felt it was time for another one as the property is undergoing many changes. Check-in went exceptionally smooth and easy. We arrived about 2:30 pm and went to the \"invited guests\" line. (I should mention that our stay is always comped as I play enough to qualify). We were given a room on the 32nd floor, which is the concierge level. I asked if it was overlooking the main construction site and since it was they promptly changed our room so that it faced the NYNY rollercoaster. Construction noise was not an issue for us. I was also given free line passes for the restaurants and informed that all of our meals and beverages from certain restaurants and the casino bars would be complimentary as well. Our room was ready-exceptionally clean. I'll note that we are early risers and our room was available to housekeeping well before noon and it was always cleaned promptly. The beds are extremely comfortable, the 32nd floor rooms are spacious and also provided robes, and turn down service complete with Godiva choclates on the pillows. (We tip housekeeping daily.) Club Monaco(the concierge club was closed for another day for remodeling, but when it was reopened it was a huge improvement over the old decor). Beautiful seating arrangements using earth tones, flat plasma tv and a well stocked bar were available from 7am-10pm. Continental breakfast, light lunch fare, a Happy Hour from 4-8 with a variety of appetizers and mini-desserts were served and there was always a waiter on hand to keep things orderly and stocked. We enjoyed going there for mid-morning coffee or a late afternoon drink. The pool area had also undergone some changes- a few more cabanas had been added it seemed, as well as more lounges, The wave pool was open but at least for the first few days the lazy river was closed. I only spent a short time by the pool so it was not an issue for me. Drink service by the pool was good. There was some construction noise but the music helped block it out- The casino was also undergoing remodeling- a new high limit slot area was nearly completed our first day there and opened that Thurs night or Fri afternoon, The new Players Club-under the MGM logo was also uncovered and it was very nice, although it was crowded with all the new members getting cards- not an issue for us since we have them already. At any given time there were areas closed off in the casino- updates, new machines, etc- all seemed in high gear- again it seems that MGM properties is making a big commitment to making the MC even better and more desirable for Vegas visitors. A new Mexican restaurant is also being constructed in the area previously occupied by a \"market -type store\" it is in the corner near one of the exits to the strip which has been closed off. There are still 2 other exits from the casino to the strip- We ate in the Brew Pub- note that they no longer brew their own beer- it is a fun place for a good meal- service was good as were the martinis. We also ate some dinners and most breakfasts in the Cafe- this was redone when we were there last Oct- again the earth tones, a new menu, but many of the same waitstaff as over the last few years. Our experiences were terrific- friendly waitstaff who remembered us, quick service, and good food. We also enjoy the Italian Market City Cafe- excellent food, generous portions, and excellent service at reasonable prices, The only disappointment we experienced(not this trip) was Dragon Noodle- had given it 3 tries during other trips and were disappointed with food(bland, cold) and service (non-existent) on all three occasions. This trip we weren't trying it again. Blackstone's is also an excellent choice for a delicious meal, although the prices are somewhat expensive for some. We usually have our special Sat night dinner there, but this trip skipped it. Service has always been always outstanding. There is a food-court located off the lobby which has a Starbucks, Sbarro's, Subway, and some other choices. We picked up sandwiches before heading to the airport for our flight home-very convenient. Parking- we rent a car whenever we go to Vegas- the big parking lot is gone because of the City Center Project going on, but we had no problems getting a parking spot in the small lot. There is also valet service and a cab line should you need one. Our stay at the MC was excellent. The staff is courteous, friendly, and professional.

We stayed at the Monte Carlo because we found a much better package flight/hotel deal there than in the more upscale Venetian, Bellagion, Mandalay Bay... I was somewhat concerned by the occassional negative reviews here. I would place the Monte Carlo is in the 2nd tier of Vegas Casinos, but we were all generally impressed. For those on a budget, MC offers a very enjoyable experience. Location -- Phenomenal. Middle of the strip. Next door to NY/NY, across the street from MGM, 1/3 mi. walk to Bellagio/Caesars. Can walk to Mandalay Bay in one direction or Venetian/Wynn in the other in about 30 minutes. Check-in went very quickly even on March Madness weekend. We had booked a single room for the 4 of us, but the front desk was able to quickly find us adjoining rooms. Room was spacious - nothing spectacular, but we had no issues with mold, stains, etc. We didn't come to Vegas to stay in the room so I have few criticisms. Would have preferred a fitted sheet on the bed, about the only thing worth mentioning. I don't recall if it had a coffee maker in the room. I was surprised by how much water pressure was in the shower. It was wonderful, but the environmentalist in me wondered how much water was being wasted in the middle of the desert. We were on the 7th floor facing away from the strip and construction and never had any concerns with noise -- nor did anyone we talked to that weekend make any mention of noise being an issue for them. Pool -- Functional but much smaller than the pool areas in the more expensive resorts. It was March, so the pool area that spent most of the time in the shade was still quite cold which meant that the other areas could get crowded. Food -- GREAT sports bar with good food. Solid food court. We ate our major meals in other hotels. Casino/Sports Book/Poker Room.

Now I am privy to the knowledge of which hotels are experiencing rennovations, which I always pass on to my clients so they do not have to hear noise have dust and debris as an issue or inconvenient walks to elevators etc... Nowhere did it say rennovations and that is because the Bellagio is expanding right smack next to the Monte Carlo and there is NO noise ordinance in vegas so the work goes on all night long. Our first night after a long flight from Washington DC we ate at the brewery which was pretty cheap and the food and drinks were fairly priced so an overall good experience (we were starving though from a long flight with no meals provided so I cant say it was the best steak I had but it was okay enough and came fast) I immediately hit for $220 not once but twice on the $1 slots so the night was going well until I went to bed around 1am. Jackhammers and trucks making that beeping noise as they back up all night long and no sound barrier whatsoever. I checked out the next morning and checked into the Mandaly Bay where the convention was at. I asked people in the elevator and lobby who were also checking out if the noise was the reason why and YES was the answer I got everytime. Half the hotel checked out, it was a mass exodus! I slept great at the Mandalay Bay but was really disappointed in their hotel as it is supposed to be a 4.5/5 star hotel and really really is not. Had the noise not been a factor I would have been happy with the Monte Carlo as everyone was friendly and the rooms kind of run down with dim lighting so you cant see the stains on the floor and bedspread. Oh I almost forgot! I noticed before I turned in at the MOnte Carlo there was blood on my pillow case! Grosssssssssssss!!!!!! I didnt even mention it to the front desk because I wanted to leave so badly after waking at 6am for convention with no sleep the night before from the construction. The Pro's- Nice people not a long wait at check in, great gambling much more giving on the slots then all the other casinos I went to including MGM,Luxor , Mandalay Bay, Hilton,Excalibur and NY NY where they just ate my money. I did start playing roulette and decided that is the way to go rather then slots but after hitting so fast at the Monte Carlo on the $1 machines I thought it must be that easy to win which was bad for me. The CONS- NOISE all day long and all night long! Dirty sheets and bedding No monorail it is closed because of the rennovations so you cant go to Bellagio from there so wear comfie shoes if you are staying at the Monte Carlo or take the $5 daily double decker bus. In my opinion you would be much better off booking a hotel at the other end of the strip where the Ventian,Wynn,Treasure Island,Harrahs and Mirage are. It is much more the feel of Vegas and there are sidewalks down there that you can walk along the strip and take it all in whereas you cant down where the Monte Carlo,MGM,Luxor etc..are. I am going back in a month and booked The Mirage this time. I am a luxury for less travel agent and our Ritz Carlton packages have been featured on Good Morning America is where I am coming from. Vegas is Vegas so even the 4 and 5 star hotels are showing their wear and tear.

The Positives: We were able to stay on average for $92/night from Tuesday to Saturday. That is actually pretty good for a major hotel on the strip. Check in was smooth with really friendly front desk staff. We got a 28th floor King size room facing Bellagio overlooking the pool and the new City Center construction site. While you definitely can hear some construction by 630 am, it wasn't horrible from where we stayed. The room itself was very roomy and comfortable. It probably shows a little bit of wear. We used the inroom safe for our valuables and had no problems. The coupons for the website special was nice but not great. We used the spa coupons for our morning exercise and sauna/whirlpool. The free dinner buffet coupon was ok for an average buffet. I stuck to the shrimp and prime rib. My wife played craps and won enough money to cover some of our room expenses (that's a first for us amateur gamblers!) The negatives: The room no longer has a coffee/tea pot which I recalled we did the first time. The bathtub drained slowly so if you shower on average 10-15 minutes, the water will rise to just below the ankle. The worst part of the stay was definitely parking as the Monte Carlo parking structure has been torn down to make way for the new City Center project. This means you can get lucky and park in short term parking lots or end up parking in the New York-New York structure. You can try valet parking but because of the parking structure demolition, the backup is incredible and when you want to pick up your car, be prepared for at least a 15 minute wait in midmorning.

The room was a smoking room with 2 queen beds. We headed back down to the front desk and reminded them of our reservation. The lady informs us all the king nonsmoking rooms are full. Then she mentions she can call the mgr and see if they will open another block - which obviously means they are not all full. The mgr is unwilling, so we are stuck in the room. She appeases us by telling us we can check into a king n/s room the next afternoon and they will even upgrade us to a strip view. We think they are being considerate only to find out otherwise later.

The noise was so loud - like dropping huge rocks into an aluminum container. The crashing sound happened every other minute. I had a couple of great spa experiences with Mila the massage therapist and Jane the skin technician. I also had the worst facial ever with Flower. The pool was packed every day. All the guests lined up at 9 am and went out and saved all the chairs. If you came out any later, you couldn't find a chair. They should not allow this practice as the people don't come back for hours and some never come back at all. Yet you can not tell which chair is available because they all have towels on them. Oh, and I have never seen so many chairs crammed into every space available. All the chairs were touching the chairs on each side. Pretty gross if you didn't know the person next to you. The rows were so close together you could hardly even make your way down the row. On our last day, I went out at 9 so I could get a good spot.

We've always been pleased. Location, location, location! This hotel has a superb location, especially if you don't have a car. You can walk right outside the front door and go across the street to the MGM or Tropicana, or next door to the New York. A short walk brings you to the Excalibur, where you can take a free monorail to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. There's a CVS and Walgreens right next door, very convenient for snacks to stock up your room, or picking up toiletries that you forgot. Movie theater and food court for quick eats are also very closeby. The hotel has an elegant atmosphere, hits you from the moment you walk in the door. The scented air is very pleasant. Check-in is usually efficient. On one occasion, we had repeated difficulties with check-in (we were given the key to a room that had not been cleaned, then to a room that was occupied) -- after a long wait and insisting on speaking to a manager, we were upgraded to a jacuzzi suite. It was wonderful, but I'm not sure it's worth the price they charge for it if you are paying full price. Our last visit was the most disappointing of all the times we've stayed there. The carpets seemed dirty and the furniture was showing some wear. The room was clean aside from the carpet, but we were on the back side of the hotel with a view of the interstate and a large construction zone. We almost asked to move to a new room, but after sleeping in the bed for one night, we stayed put -- the bed was wonderful, more comfortable than our bed at home! Maid service was good, our room was cleaned very nicely each day. Room service trays seemed to remain on the hallway floor for a day or two before being picked up. The food court adjacent to the casino was also under construction with most of it blocked off and no place to sit. The parking garage is gone (for now at least) as it has been torn down to make room for new construction, so there is no covered parking (and covered parking is a huge plus in summer!). Ask for a room with a strip view and avoid the construction views/noise. The pool area was nice before; major construction was happening at the pool when we were last there, so hopefully when it re-opens this spring it will be even better. The rooms are very adequate for the price and staff is invariably courteous and helpful. On our last visit, there was a small problem with a large and rowdy group late at night in the next room. We called the front desk, and security appeared instantly and handled the situation with tact. We had a fantastic waitress in the casino, wish I could remember her name, she was a dream. The staff at the sports bar is also very friendly, the bartenders are great if you can get a seat at the bar (it is almost always full). Blackstone's Steakhouse is excellent, not crowded and has very attentive, experienced staff. I love steak, and every steak I've ever had there has been top-rate. Very nice and you can talk to your companions without having to yell over the din that seems to be the norm at so many restaurants, but you have to exit the restaurant to go to the restroom. The Houdini lounge was too loud to allow for conversation. The Chinese restaurant is very good -- we found it to be an excellent value for lunch, less so for dinner. The buffet is a pass, the food was ordinary and the price is rather high. A good value, but be sure to ask for a room with a strip view. Nice rooms, comfortable beds, and friendly staff.

We also booked four other rooms for our guests. No problem with our room (we booked a mini suite which was very spacious - jacuzzi bath, two bathrooms etc) but when our other guests came to check in there were some real problems. One couple who had requested twin beds could only get a king bed on a smoking floor (not acceptable). After a bit of negotiation with the supervisor at check in (who did not once apologise for the inconvenience) I managed to secure them two free buffet passes and the promise of a new room the next day. Whilst the new room did materialise, when they came to check out they were charged for the buffets and were absolutely adamant that it had to be paid despite our best arguments. That was disgusting in my opinion. When my in-laws checked in they were given a room that was already occupied ! The staff did give them a new room immediately and also the buffet passes ( which they were not charged for, thankfully). Another couple in my party had to change their room THREE times - first one hadn't been cleaned, second was a smoking room, luckily the third was ok - but they were not offered anything for their inconvenience. They were the bad points, which, for my wedding, and the fact we were spending over $10,000 at the hotel during our five day stay, left a bitter tast in my mouth, and on that basis I wouldn't give my money to the Monte Carlo again. On the good points, Andre's restaurant, as a venue for a small wedding dinner reception is superb. I had liaised in advance with their planner, Renee, who is fantastic. We had a private dining room and use of the salon next to it for the whole night (we arrived at 6pm). The waiting staff were amazing and the food was fantastic. My party (14 of us in total) could not stop talking about how great it was, and some of them have eaten at some of London's finest restaurants. It really couldn't have been better and nothing was too much trouble. They even baked us a special wedding cheesecake instead of the traditional wedding cake. In the salon they have a humidor with some of the finest cigars and many many vintage cognacs and brandies, which were rather enjoyed by all ! We also used the spa at the hotel, which was nice, and I also used the salon to have my wedding hair and make up done and they were very good. I suspect our experience of the Monte Carlo may have been tarnished by the fact it was the busiest weekend in Vegas (NBA All Star convention) ever and the staff did seem to be rather frazzled.

Very ugly but the noise isn't too bad. Service is weak, check in was slow. The hotel also does not seem to care at all about water conservation. They wash all the towels each day regardless of whether you have the towels hung up or not and in our family members rooms, they said the shower heads put out tons of water with no way to lower the pressure.

This room was with a \"strip view\",HUH, a view of the top of the casino area, so basically I am now aware of how many A/C units it takes to keep the casino going. You could see a 10 foot area of the strip sidewalk, so I guess that was the qualification. This room was no quieter, as the housekeeping staff thinks shouting from one end of the hall to the other is okay, no matter if it is 8:00 am or 6:00 pm, no naps to be had here. I did ask if we could move even if we had to pay an additional fee. We could have the same type of room, just on a higher floor, but that would have doubled the cost per night of our room, or we could have the spa room but for the remaining three nights it would have ended up costing more than half of what the entire trip, flight and all had cost, so we just stuck it out in our \"better\" room. And just a note, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, don't bring young children to Vegas! Our last night we had a very young child next door, screaming from 9:00pm until 2:45 am. We had a 7:15 am flight, so we basically didn't sleep at all that night. Leave the screaming kids at home. I went out of town to have a few days away from my kids, I don't need to hear yours. The water pressure in the shower was great, but you end up standing calf deep in water. We asked that they fix the drain issue, which left us standing ankle deep in water during showers.

The hotel is reasonably priced, right on the strip, within walking distance to many of the bigger hotels and casinos and close to The Deuce (the bus that rides up and down the strip and into Downtown). At first we were a little bit nervous because of many poor reviews but decided to take our chances. We got really nervous once we checked in and saw the room we were given on the 3rd floor with a view of a concrete roof and two queen beds instead of the king we requested. Once we saw the room we turned right around and requested something different. Thankfully they were nice to us and gave us a room on the 16th floor with a decent view of the mountains and a king bed. From then on there were no problems. There is construction in the pool area, however it was 65 degrees outside and no one in their right mind would want to go swimming now anyway. Also, since Las Vegas is constantly reinventing itself there was a bit of construction going on around the hotel, but that is to be expected and if your room is on the far side away from the construction it's not too distracting at all. We tried the buffet (with a 2 for 1 coupon) and it was okay, but we definately had better while in Vegas - if you go Downtown try the Golden Nugget for a buffet at lunch, only $10/person and really good food!

We got a great deal through a travel website for Monte Carlo and since neither one of us had stayed there before we thought we would give it a try. The room itself was an average best western at best. In Vegas you don't spend all that much time in the room so it wasn't a big deal to us that it wasn't 4 star (or 3 star for that matter). The problems that we had with the hotel were the following: ~The Walls were paper thin. Normally not necessarily a big deal but we could hear our neighbor brushing his teeth. Upon hearing that we figured if we could hear something that clearly that isn't a noisy thing, what might they hear from our room as a newly engaged couple?!?!? So that kind of put a damper on any \"activities\" in the room. ~Proximity to ANYTHING. From all pictures of Vegas the Monte Carlo looks like it is smack dab in the middle of the strip. This is just not the case. My parents were staying at the Bellagio and it was easily a 15 minute walk (in 30 degree weather) to get to the door of thier hotel. There wasn't much directly acrossed the street nor to the south side. It was very strange being so isolated in Vegas. If you want to be close to the action, this is not your hotel. ~Casino not for table players. Neither my fiance nor myself play slots. I play Pai Gow Poker and he plays Black Jack. This being the case we enjoy casinos with lots of tables. There were two Pai Gow Tables and maybe a dozen black jack tables which the ones with affordable minimums were completely full. If you like slots this seemed like a good place to be. ~Construction. To be honest we didn't hear it as much as others did and because of the weather were weren't going to be using the pool anyway..BUT it did add to the feeling of isolation.

The bars and restaurants are reflective of the class of the hotel, but it is nice to have a fast food court right in the front of the hotel. I also found it nice to be able to go directly from the elevator bank into the lobby - a nice feature if you are on a business trip. One thing we noticed were that cabs were not as available here as we would have expected. The property is further from the convention center than many properties, so that might have been the driver for that.

I truly believe this hotel hates tourists and caters to the locals. From the moment we approached the front desk to the day we left, all we were told was..No..No..and NO. Not only were the people at the front desk lacking clear english speaking skills, but the looked like they did not want to be bothered with anyone. Every one of them looked like disgruntled employees. There was no smile, no greeting and when we asked if we could have a room overlooking the strip we got a very firm NO. We asked if we could have a room that was a higher floor. We were told that we could, but the room wouldn't be ready until after 3:00. Around 3:30 we went up to our assigned room and found that the room had not been cleaned and the maid had not even been told to clean it. We asked her to clean the room and we'd come back later. We went down to the food court where we thought we'd get a few hot dogs from Nathan's. We had a simple order, a combo #1 and a combo #2. Very simple. It probably would have helped a great deal if the cashier could understand english but nonetheless, when the food came up, it was the wrong order. We told them what we had ordered and they told us that we had ordered something else. They didn't offer to fix the order in fact they got rather snooty about it. Our next incident happened with one of the dealers when we were trying to check our cell phones to see if they worked in the casino. The dealer very angrily told us that cell phones at the table are not allowed. We were not even sitting at a table when this happened. We told him that we were just checking to see if they rang (my husband and I were calling each other..standing right next to each other). He said it didn't matter and that it was not allowed. Next, just a bit of information for the poker players, stay out of the poker room here. The place is packed with locals and they have their own little clique. Tourists are not welcome in *their* poker room. We sat at a few tables playing blackjack and not only were the employess depressing & expressionless (they never smiled), but they really made you feel like you owed them something because they were putting up with you. Pit boss had the same blank face. For the late nighters that would like a snack, they have a McDonalds that is supposed to stay open until 3am. At 1:50 am while standing in a long line, hungry, we were all told that they were closing at 2am..and they were out of most everything. All of us in line were kind of shocked and asked why they were closing at 2am when their posted hours were until 3. We never got a clear answer but they said they were out of food. We were able to obtain the last of the Chicken nuggests. The attitude at this McDonalds fit in with the rest of the hotel and I can't believe that a corporate entity would put such inept and non-english speaking people into this environment that is supposed to cater to its customers. In closing, our final straw was when we went to speak with the manager. We tried sitting down to eat prior to this but we're overran by the cleaning service chattering loudly to each other in spanish while collecting the trash We explained how dissappointed we were with the hotel, the service and the employess. (he didn't smile either). We told him that we had planned to stay an additional night but because of the bad experience so far, we were going to leave. He offered us a late check out as compensation for the lousy time. I guess no one told him that I could have got that by just calling down to the front desk in the morning.

At 4AM the first day we were woke up by someone operating a jackhammer device. They did move us to the 300 wing where the noise was considerably less.

The buffet was closed, the small store by the Lance Burton theatre was closed and the food court, while open, was torn up with scattered seating. Though it was winter, the pool area is no more. When it will return, I cannot say. The Brewpub no longer brews their own beer which was the best thing about the MC. The menu is much smaller than in the past, but still a very good place for a light meal.

We called the Monte Carlo figuring we might get decent rates. We got great rates. We are frequent hotel guests as our travels take us many places. We know hotels good and, unfortunately from time to time, bad. We got some of the best service we have had in years at the Monte Carlo. We checked in less than an hour later coming straight from the airport. The gentleman checking us in, Joel, was fantastic putting us at ease about our travel being interrupted. He had the \"If you need anything just let me know\" approach that was refreshing. Recently Vegas seems to have developed a rather rude reputation particularly along The Strip but the old Vegas customer service is alive and well at the Monte Carlo. The room we got was clean and roomy. Great view and we were close to just about everything we wanted to see. The staff was incredibly polite. Housekeeping was marvelous as was each and every staff member we encountered. That is hard to say in this day and age. Construction? Yeah there is construction going on but there is construction everywhere in Vegas right now. We bailed on the Paris for our reservations this time because the Paris has had so much construction going on inside the hotel. Joel, the gentleman checking us in at the Monte Carlo, was nice enough to place us on a high, quiet floor and we found it quite peaceful. The restaurants in the Monte Carlo are great. Andre's is one of the top 100 restaurants in the US. They even have a brew pub! A number of the mega-hotels are overrated in my opinion and the customer service is greatly lacking. We got the kind of service Vegas was once known for. The Monte Carlo is far better than middle of the road and rivals the big four (Caesar's, Bellagio, Veneitan, Paris) center-strip cornerstones.

After reading about the construction on TA, I called the Monte Carlo to find out the extent of it before booking - I was assured that the only construction being done was outside (the pool) and that it would not affect my stay. First night - check in to room to find that there isn't any water. A call to the front desk informs me that they shut off the water to purge the pipes. When asked why guests weren't informed of the situation I was told it's not their problem. Can't use the sink, flush the toilet or shower... but plenty of attitude from the staff. Next day - went down to the buffet to find it's closed. There is a sign posted stating \"Temporarily Closed\" so I asked nearby staff how long temporarily is: nobody knew. With that option out, went over to food court to grab a bite. The restaurants were open but there was no seating - it's a construction area draped off with plastic. After another day - hurray, the maid decided to show up. Along with more attitude from the front desk.

It turned out to be the stay that may keep us from staying on the strip for some time. And that's saying something! There were several problems that the Hotel was made aware of and did little to address and a couple that they couldn't do much about but still made the stay miserable. I'll address these in the order of abrasiveness: First: the 'working girls'. On my last night at MC, I decided to stay up late and play the slots while my mate slept. Starting at about 2AM, I became the target of more than a handful of hookers (prostitutes, etc.) These were aggresive ones, too- they would elbow me gnetly as they brushed by, offering their 'company.' After three of these incidents right in the middle of this casino (and remember everything in the casino is monitored by the 'eye in the sky' security), I marched angrily to the casino security desk and explained what was happening. Instead of following up on the report and sending someone to watch and throw the 'ladies' out, I was more or less ignored. I then returned to the slots and was approached again not more than five minutes later- and with no security responding. I returned to the security desk and made a distinct number 4 gesture to the officer, explaining the 4th 'lady of the evening' had just appeared. Still no help, though some phone call was supposedly made. I returned to gaming again and, sure enough, TWO more hookers did their act. I finally gave up and went to bed. Now, I have visited the much maligned Fremont Street casinos and have never had a single 'proposal,' yet this higher-than-average priced casino/hotel is teeming with hookers and they don't care. The most response I have received so far is a 'comment card' at check out. Hardly a family venue and I'd suggest holding on tightly to your wallet, fellas. At least after midnight. Next, the housekeeping. To begin with, the rug in our 'deluxe' room was heavily soiled and stained and the furniture clearly had been around since the days of the Sands. Next, the maid left a melted bucket of ice and a number of soiled soda glasses around the room. I hope she wasn't expecting a tip. Finally, the parking mess. When we were there in December 2006 (and they say this will be an issue til Fall 2007), the MC had no parking structure. It was torn down for the City Center construction, leaving only a small (maybe 80-space) self-park lot and a horribly overwrought valet service. When we used valet, we had to wait a full 20 minutes in the then 35-degree weather. Plan on the same parking mess if you stay at MC through at least September. Make sure to ask upon booking if the new structure is open- you will HATE your stay if you have a car and it is not. OH, and that construction! We were sort-of facing the construction project (where Boardwalk casino once stood) and all we heard was a loud rat-a-tat, clunk-clunk-clunk all night, every night. Plan on that until City Center is open. It took a lot to make us question staying on the strip, but Monte Carlo did the trick. We also dislike the every-other-block construction that destroys the beauty of the resorts and makes walking very far more like a mine field. If I were on LV's planning commission, I'd limit the number of projects in one area at one time. Next stay for us: Red Rock Hotel/Casino which, on our first visit, looked smashing!

Also didn't care for the so called \"Quality shops\", but I am a cheap skate.....! Checked in within 10 mins of arrival, very simple and easy. Casino was great, really enjoyed it, mind you didn't have a too many good wins. plenty of parking. Near to all the other new casino's in the southern end of the strip. Ait con was good. Only issue I had was that each side of the hotel there is building work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and goes on well into the evening. Got used to that though. I guess if you had a room lower that the 29th floor, it could be louder, so higher the room less noise. All the hotel was extreamly clean and very fresh, even in the casino. Free drinks to players of slots and tables. Watch the high price in the newsagent and basically all the shops. Bit of a con. Recommend the breakfast buffet, try the ommletts! Maccy D's open 24 hrs. Beware of the hotdogs next door to Maccy D's......Their hard to digest, sickly and exspensive. Lance Burton is the resident show. posters of him everywhere. I hate him personally. Didn't see the show but others that did said he was average, just repeating tricks in different styles. Not a World Famous as the posters surggest! Staff were very good and all punter were friendly. Didn't see any trouble. If ya like ya coffee in your room, go to WALMART and get a coffee maker (cheap) and some coffee and whitener and enjoy. Then just leave it behind.

Again though, if you're not spending much time in the room it's not a big deal. At this time of year, only one of the pools is open and it happens to be in the shade the majority of the day so I never spent any time at it. That might be something to consider if you're wanting to be sitting by a pool at this time of year.

Hoever we upgraded to a Spa suite for only $80 per couple a night - this room had a spa overlooking the MGM, a surround sound system in it, a sauna in the shower, a kitchen, a bar and a separate lounge - AMAZING FOR $80!!!!!!! The best thing about the Monte Carlo is the poker room and Casino - its not as high profile as the others but I thought it had the best atmosphere out of all of them. They played excellent music everytime we were in there and the staff were very good. The poker room is the best on the strip if you are looking for a good game of limit poker - very welcoming for beginners but also some nice pots to be one if you know what you are doing. Granted there was some construction going on behind the hotel but I think this is effecting most of the hotels in the area. The postion of the hotel was excellent. You are walking distance to the Bellagio, the Paris, New York, MGM, Caesers. For eating in the hotel go to the Buffet diner as it serves excellent breakfasts and burgers.

One tip about Vegas - dont go near the Rio hotel casino -its truly disgusting - the staff are rude and the casino is old and needs updating.

When we checked in, I requested a room away from the construction and got a room on the 20th Floor facing the Strip going North, which had a partial view of the construction. We heard the beeping of the trucks and the pile driver on and off during our stay, but it didn't bother us too much. The noise that really bothered us was inside the hotel. The running water in the showers on either side of us was very loud. When you flushed the toilet in our room it made a very loud noise (boom!). When the people in the room next to us put their key in their door, it sounded like they were entering our room. All these noises were tolerable during the day, but could definitely wake you up at night or if you took a nap during the day. I would definitely recommend earplugs. I used them and slept soundly. I didn't like the shower because there was no bar in the shower or on top of the soap dish to hold onto or hang your washcloth. I did okay with that, but my 80 year old mother, who stayed in a separate room with my sister, had a hard time showering. She placed a towel on the bottom of the tub for more traction and that help steady her a bit in the absence of a bar or handle to hold on to. The pool area is very small since half of it is closed due to the construction. The shuttle from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio is also closed due to the construction. When we took a cab back to the airport, it got stuck on the roadway that runs on the side of the hotel because construction vehicles were blocking the road. After about 10 minutes or so, the driver made a u-turn (along with many other vehicles) and went to the road that runs behind the hotel. Again, we were stuck waiting for construction vehicles to go by, this time for about 5 minutes. So a 10-minute cab ride to the airport took 25 minutes and cost $24 instead of $14, which we paid when we arrived. The things we liked about the hotel were the lobby being situated right next to the elevators so we didn't have to walk through the casino with our luggage and the fact that the property isn't as big as some of the other hotels in Las Vegas making it easy to navigate and find slot machines and tables to play. On previous trips I've stayed at the MGM Grand and Treasure Island and was very pleased with both. I was disappointed with the Monte Carlo and will never stay there again, even after the construction is completed.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horstead, norwich", "Title": "\u201cA definate no no\u201d", "Author": "Horstead", "ReviewID": "UR5980926", "Content": "This was my third visit to Vegas and will be my last.

Parts of the pool were closed presumably because of the construction work. Each day we walked the 1/4 hour trek to the MGM where we used their delightful amenities.

We usually call around in advance to the nicer hotels on the Strip and book the cheapest one. We have stayed at Bally's, the Monte Carlo, MGM Grand, NY NY, and the Luxor. I don't think we have ever paid more than $150 a night, even on a weekend night. A few weeks ago, some friends of ours decided to get married in Vegas and asked us to come along to help them celebrate. Our joining them was kind of a spur-of-the-moment deal (about two weeks from our arrival there), and there was a HUGE convention going on in LV that weekend, so almost everything was completely booked - and hideously expensive. Even the Casino Royale, which definitely does not qualify as a \"nice\" hotel, was running $150/night. The cheapest rate I could find other than the Casino Royale was at the Monte Carlo, which ran us $550 for two nights. Gack. However, I had read on this site that somebody had been robbed recently at the Casino Royale, so I swallowed hard and booked the Monte Carlo. We were there from Oct 13-15. The hotel is very nice. The lobby is spacious and impressive (although not even close to as impressive as, say, the lobby of the Bellagio). Check-in was a little lame - there was a LONG wait on a Friday afternoon, which I imagine to be a pretty popular time to arrive in Las Vegas. The hotel is pretty centrally located on the Strip, which is a huge plus for us because we never rent a car when we go. Our room was clean and attractive, with marble in the bathroom and a bed that was more comfortable than average. It also had an in-room safe, which I liked. However, the towels - and the WALLS - were painfully thin. The towels were thinner than the old junk towels we keep around to dry off our dog when it's raining. As for the walls, this normally wouldn't be a problem for me, as I am a heavy sleeper, but for an average of $275/night, I expect to be *pampered*. And to be able to hang out in my hotel room without having to hear the people in the next room coughing. Two other things that I thought were plusses which others might not - there is a food court in the hotel that offers crappy (and cheapish) fast food (like McDonald's, Sbarro's, Nathan's, and Starbucks). I would normally not be the least bit excited about McDonald's, but I have to admit that it's a little refreshing now that Vegas has gotten so horribly expensive to be able to buy a cheap meal. I had at least one meal there that cost less than the \"service fee\" for the ATM in the lobby (which was $4). They also have probably the biggest and best \"Everything's $10\" store (only it really has some fancy French name - Bijoux something) I have ever seen. So those were good things. Overall, I would definitely stay here again, but I wasn't impressed for the price. So if you're headed that way, be sure to book early!

Our experience was mixed. First, check-in was very slow. There were too few staff for the number of people and the clerk we had was very slow. First she could not find my parents' reservation. Then, she attempted to bill me room rates even though I had reserved through expedia and prepaid. She then swiped my credit card multiple times because she seemed not to be keeping track of what she was doing. We were placed in unsatisfactory rooms on the fifth floor overlooking a huge ventilation system on top of the casino that produced a constant humming buzz and boasted huge spotlights that glared into our room. We also overlooked the enormous excavation next door. They are putting up a new resort between the Monte Carlo and the Bellagio. We were aware that there would be construction but no one informed us that Las Vegas is permitting 24-hour construction at this site. My wife called the front desk and asked to be moved. The first clerk told her that there was construction on all four sides of the hotel and, in any event, no non-smoking rooms available that night and hung up. She immediately called back and a different clerk told her to come down the next day after check-out time to see if another room was available. She called a third time in 3 minutes and a third clerk enthusiastically agreed that the room was unsatisfactory and he reserved a 31st-floor room for us starting the next day. We then went to tell my parents, who were also very upset with their room. My mother called the front desk but they were not willing to reserve another room for my parents as well. All they said was to come down the next day to try for a new room. In the end, a helpful clerk moved us both to the 31st floor the next day, but we could not understand why we got such conflicting answers from the front desk. All I can say is, if you are unsatisfied, continue pressing until someone makes it right. Even though the first check-in clerk repeatedly swiped my credit card, when they moved us to the new room they did not keep the credit card file so we ended up unable to charge restaurant purchases or make phone calls. When my wife went down to add a credit card to our room, they initially would not accept it because the room was in my name. Most other services were fine. My parents called maintenance to unplug the shower drain and it was done within 20 minutes. The rooms were comfortable, bathrooms were spacious, and the rooms had a free wall safe. The staff was helpful with telling us how to get places and where to find things. The breakfast buffet was very good for $12. We did not eat other meals at the hotel. We went to the brewpub on a Sunday night - it was deserted but they were blaring music and we left because it was too noisy even to talk. We were disappointed that the wave pool, river ride and pool bar were closed. Those were two attractions that we looked forward to when we were picking hotels. All pools at Mandalay Bay and the Bellagio were open and it was 85 degrees. We do not understand why the pools were closed. More importantly, neither Expedia nor the hotel website said anything about when the pools would be closed or about the construction. We would have like to be informed about the construction. The construction noise only woke me when we stayed on the 5th floor, not on the 31st, but it was loud during the daytime even on the 31st floor. The construction produced other inconveniences, too. The window in our first room was caked with construction dust, the pool area for the one pool that was open was noisy and dusty, and the Deuce stop outside the hotel was closed due to construction. The only way to access the hotel by bus was to get off at the Bellagio and walk a long walk next to a dirty, dusty construction site or to ride past the hotel to the Excalibur and walk back. The hotel was decent, but we would stay there again until the construction project next door is finished. For the cost relative to other resorts, there were too many aggravations. Tip: For a cheap, good meal, there is an In 'N Out burger across the I-15 from the backside of New York, New York. It's about a $7 cab ride from Monte Carlo or you can walk through the back of the New York resort and across the overpass in about 10-15 minutes.", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton,NJ", "Title": "\u201cConstruction all around\u201d", "Author": "NorthSouth", "ReviewID": "UR5967427", "Content": "I made my reservation and then read the reviews concerning construction noise.

Which was very loud and noticable. So instead at night we made sure to turn the auto fan on, so we had back ground noise while sleeping and then we slept like babies! The beds are amazing, we had a king with feather pillows and duvet!!!! Also upgrading we got some coupons, like a free desert and deals through out the hotel. We loved the brew pub, and the cafe. Both had amazing quantities of food. Both times we ordered from each we could of split the amount of food in half. Huge meals, so maybe think of sharing. Also, the brew pub has the best vegas lite beer, and the BEST 10 oz burger I've ever had. Its like a steak on a bun. Also at the pub try a giraffe they are definatly the neatest thing I have ever seen. As for the casino every night we toured the strip and always came back to our casino. Ours was usually one of the busiest ones so when other people said that it was dead in their reviews, we were confused! The service was great one night we were there and played and drank for 5 hours. The waitress ALWAYS came back to check on us. Just make sure to start her off with a good tip and she will for sure come back. Although I must say while I was there I didn't really ever see any jackpots go, or bells on the slot machines. The pool was amazing, but hours for the pool in October were kinda a disappointing since it still was high 80's the whole week we were there. They were open 9-5 and most of the main pool was shade until 2-3 in the afternoon. The lazy river and wave pool were also closed. We were definatly looking forward to relaxing in the lazy river, and were quite disappointed about that. Also when you go down to the pool, don't over pay for drinks. Buy them across the street at the convenience store (the plaza where you can rent the cars) and just a 6 pack of corona or smirnoff for 9.95. Rather then 6.50 per drink by the pool. They never once said anything to us, just make sure to pour it in a plastic cup. Overall we had a great vacation, people were always friendly and asking if there was anything they could do to make it better.

We were also celebrating our 30th anniversary & my husband's birthday. From the minute we got into our room, we knew we were in trouble...after reading many reports about the \"thin walls\" here, we quickly encountered this problem after 5 minutes in our room. We could literally hear ever word of a telephone conversation that the man was having in the next room. We have NEVER had that happen before in any other hotel! It was very annoying but we figured we would just try to overlook that. We went to the dinner buffet which was very sub-standard food. We gave it a 3.5 out of 10. The next morning we awoke at 4:30 am to the sound of the man next door talking on the phone again and using his electric shaver, & water pic etc. You could hear EVERYTHING!!! It was if he was in OUR room!! He left the room approximently 8am, but we could not fall back asleep. Also, I might mention that the construction noise IS very, very, loud, but we found that to be MORE tolerable than the noise in the next door room. We put on our bathing suits and headed done to the breakfast buffet. This was slightly better than the dinner buffet and we rated it a 5 out of 10. We proceeded to go to the pools only to find out that there was ONLY ONE POOL OPEN...the others were closed for the season....and the one pool that was open was IN THE SHADE until 4pm each day. One of the reason's we were looking forward to this hotel was for their pool's....we expressed this at the time we made a reservation and also at check-in. We were NEVER TOLD that the other 2 pools were closed and the other one was in the shade for most of the day. We came there to sit in the sun and relax, after all the temperatures were in the high 80's! We were so annoyed with everything and decided that we could no longer stay at this hotel, so we checked out and went to stay at Treasure Island.

This is our second time to Vegas and the 3 other couples we were traveling with have been to Vegas several times each. I have worked with the public for 20 years in the food service industry and know how to treat people courteously and appreciate the same. We booked in May 2006 for our rooms for 4 nights starting on the 27th of September. Bad Points: Check In \u2013 Confusing, Tiring and Lengthy - We arrived in the middle of the week too. I could not imagine checking into this place on a weekend. We had called the Monte Carlo reservation line prior to our arrival and requested rooms facing the strip and higher up. The request was on our file when we arrived according to the receptionist. We arrived at the Monte Carlo parking lot at 2:15pm, got out of the airport transport to be greeted with a pile driving machine from the construction operating behind us breaking up cement. The Travel Rep who greeted us at the hotel was yelling and we still could not hear her over the noise. We had to get into the lobby so we could hear her instructions. She told us that the hotel has a strict policy of releasing room keys no earlier than 3:00pm. We had to wait until 3:00 to get our room keys and that the porter would have our luggage in our rooms at 3:00. We had lunch in the Brew Pub and went back at 4:00pm and got the keys. Checked out the rooms and no luggage in any of the rooms and all the rooms overlooked the construction on the backside of the property. Also, one of our rooms was not made up. The previous guests left lots of DNA on the sheets - disgusting and a general mess overall. Not a good impression, especially for the couple who was supposed to occupy that room. We then tried to change rooms. I was greeted by indifference by a complacent person at the front desk. This was my first interaction with a Monte Carlo employee and fortunately, he was the only rude person we encountered. He just told me no room change without the luggage that we had to wait for the luggage to get to our rooms. Not even a smile from him during our entire transaction. I was pleasant the entire time. He is not doing his employers any favor. If you don\u2019t like working with the public get into another line of work. We then went to the area where the luggage is distributed to see if we could retrieve it from there. After a 10 minute wait, we were told it was on its way to the rooms so we sent our husbands up to the rooms to wait for the luggage while we stood in line to try to get the rooms changed out. Finally, someone with the travel company talked to the person at the front desk and then they entertained our request to change rooms even though we did not know where our luggage was. We all ended up on the side of the hotel facing the strip on higher floors. All with 2 queen size beds in each room. We retrieved our luggage shortly after. Noise: This place is noisy. No doubt about it. Walls are thin Hall noise is not buffered Noise from the construction on 3 sides of the block at all hours Water running through the plumbing is loud Nightclub across the strip from the Monte Carlo is LOUD on Friday and Saturday. Note: There is construction in the front and the back of the building so no escaping the pile driving. There is a 9 billion dollar project being built on the same block as the Monte Carlo and we were told it would be completed in a couple of years. The pile drivers started their hammering at 4:11am on the first night and then 3:10am the next night. (at least that is when it woke me up) Earplugs help and if your window can be opened keep it shut. Noise from the night club across the strip \u2013 there is a 24 hour night club across the street called Emerald or Empress. It is loud on Friday and Saturday. One person in our party woke up in the middle of the night and the base from the music across the street startled her. It pulled her out of a deep sleep and with the vibrations she thought she was having a heart attack! It was still going at 6:30 am on the Sunday morning we checked out. Comfort of Beds: Beds were comfy. The pillows were not hard at all but they were thick. Just fat pillows so your head is probably more elevated than usual. They gave me a sore neck so if you use the edge of the pillow it alleviates that problem. Food: Brew Pub \u2013 Caf\u00e9 \u2013 Breakfast Buffet and Food Fare are the places we tried. The Brew Pub food is good and reasonably priced. Eight of us had a mid afternoon meal complete with 2 beer each for $10.00 per couple. We bought the tower of beer and a couple of beers on the side. We shared appetizers such as nachos and quesadillas, onion rings. Very good first impression on the food if you like Pub style fare. The servers there were awesome each time we went. Very upbeat. Caf\u00e9 Restaurant: Food was great there. Everyone liked their meals. Check out the menu before you go in and if there is something you think you would like, chances are you will enjoy it. The burgers run around $9.00 and do fill you up. One person in our party had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with steamed broccoli. A healthy portion of well made comfort food, he enjoyed it. I had a chicken Caesar salad and enjoyed that until I found a 4\u201d hair in it and pointed it out to my waitress. I told her that it happens and but I could not finish eating it after finding a hair. I was quite surprised that it was not removed from the bill. I had to ask the person at the till to take it off the bill. I have never charged any customer for food that had a hair in it in my years of serving. It happens on the rare occasion and when it does happen the facility should do their best to accommodate the guest. Breakfast Buffet $10.00 per person. The omlette station was great. Has shrimp, cheddar cheese, ham and standard toppings. I did over hear a guest trying to get toast. Toast was not available according to the staff there. The usual meats, ham, ham hocks, Italian sausage, sausage patties, bacon, fruit, yoghurts etc. It was standard breakfast buffet fare. Food Fare: Standard fast food - no complaints. Pools The pool area is okay but the adult area is in the shade all day. Plus the noise from the construction is LOUD. Maybe in 3 years it would be tolerable. Purple Reign \u2013 Monte Brew Pub Show. This is a Wednesday night show not advertised anywhere that we noticed. A Prince tribute. I read about it on the TA Forum and called the front desk when we arrived to get more details and confirm it was on for Wednesday. We went to the 10pm show and it was fantastic. No cover charge, although the drink prices do go up by 10% at 10pm. Well worth the modest charge. Phones in the room 2 phones in our rooms. One on the desk and one on the nightstand. $ 1.00 + tax per local calls Bathrooms The bathroom was a decent size - no complaints here - the usual shampoo, conditioner and soap available. We tipped everyday so near the end of our 4 nights we got some shower gel, sewing kit etc. With all the other options in Vegas we likely won\u2019t be returning to this hotel.

We knew before we even walked in that they gave us a smoking room (with 2 queen beds to boot). We were exhausted from traveling (it was 12M in Vegas, 3AM EST), but we walked all the way back down to the lobby only to be told that there were no non-smoking rooms available and we had no choice but to sleep there. While in retrospect we should have fought a little harder for a room change, we were just SO tired. We decided to let it be and just take the room and go to bed. I literally felt like I slept in an ashtray and I really didn't even sleep. At 6AM I went back down to the lobby to get our room changed or we were going to have to find another place to stay. I was given another room no problem. We changed rooms right away and this room was better (and with a King Bed). All in all, the Monte Carlo is just standard. It's fine for just any old vacation but after moving to the Bellagio at the end of the trip, you really can see the difference.

Upon arrival we were offered an upgrade to a Spa Suite for an additional $70.00 per night, since this upgrade is usually $220.00 a night we decided to splurge for the first two nights. We were in a cornor room on the 23rd floor and the suite had a full bar and stools all in marble. A fridge, and a 4 person marble jacuzzi tub against the wall facing the Eiffel Tower and MGM. The tolietries are a step up from the standard room and are provided for your jacuzzi and in the spacious bathroom. There is surround sound around the huge bed--(one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on-even in a standard room). We received coupons for 2-1 Buffet, Raft rentals Spa Admissions and drinks upon arrival and a free $10.00 item from Bijoux Ternier-since we booked directly with the hotel website.The weather was 100-105 all week so the 5 pools are a great asset to this property.

The waitresses were prompt and friendly around the pool as we enjoyed a couple of poolside cocktails.

It is central and therefore not a typical killer Vegas walk to go to other properties. There is a Walgreens and CVS just outside and a MIni Mart for liquor and beer. We ate at the foodcourt a few times-nice Italian food and the desserts at the 24 hour cafe were amazing.

Plenty of options at the food court and a gift shop right at the front as well.

Pool was crowded as others have stated, but we went down around 1:30 and that's peak pool time. Had a great time in the lazy river and wave pool, and second day we also relaxed at the adult pool which was nice. Adult pool is mostly in the shade until about 3:00 though. Appreciated the lack of too cool hipsters, but still a decent crowd. Casino was easy to navigate and as stated by others, lacked the smoky smell. The steak house there is really good, as is the Japanese noodle house that serves excellent sushi. Other than that we hit the food court once and went across the street the other day. The construction was the only downfall really. It's not terribly loud, but it's definitely there. Monday night we got a nice dose of it around midnight, guess in Vegas nobody sleeps. I was smart though and brought earplugs. Seemed to help a little bit, but didn't drown it out completely. I slept fine though. We will definitely visit again, once the construction is complete. Oh and beware of certain ladies behind the sports book counter, check your ticket before you walk away. My boyfriend lost some cash because she entered his picks incorrectly. Not a large amount, but $150 isn't a small amount either. He said she seemed to be lost, and questioned his picks 2 or 3 times, then it appeared she had gotten it together, apparently not.

I got the same level of service at the penny slots as I did in the high limit room. I make a particular reference and thank you to my casino host David. He met all of my reasonable and even my unreasonable requests. He made my first trip to Vegas an experience I will never forget. Because of his hospitality it will not be my last. For that, I thank you, thank you, thank you David. After 2 days of play, he upgraded me to a complimentary suite, a suite which surpassed my expectations of any hotel room imaginable. The Monte Carlo suites are to die for!!! I had NEVER stayed in that form of luxury. Furthermore, the staff continued their unbelievable hospitality.

I was worried about construction noise after reading previous reviews, however my room overlooked the casino and construction and while I could hear some noise it was not very loud certainly not loud enough to wake me up. The swimming pools were one reason I chose this hotel and they were excellent, it was good having the choice of a normal pool, a wave pool or the rapid river. The swimming pool area was also very well maintained. I took the tip of a previous review and bought an inflatable ring from the Walgreene store opposite the hotel, to rent one for the day was $12, I bought mine for $4. Wednesday night there was a free Prince tribute show in the Hotels Brewery bar, this was very good and lasted for over two hours. I liked the casino and found that unlike a lot of other casinos on the strip it was nice and bright. A good tip is that outside the hotel people were giving out coupon booklets, these allowed you to buy a drink at the hotel bar and receive a free one, they also gave a free upgrade at the Starbucks on site. If you are going for a few days I would recommend hiring a car and driving 150 miles (3 hours) to Zion National Park, it is truly breathtaking. It is similar to the Grand canyon only a lot greener. Another tip, if you are travelling from the airport and there is more than one of you, you are best to get a taxi. The airport is very close to the hotels and a taxi will only cost $10, a shuttle bus costs $5 per person. Also if you have the option try and stay during the week, the hotel cost is a fraction compared to the weekend and Las Vegas is just as busy on a weekday as a weekend.", "Date": "September 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hilltop, California", "Title": "\u201cConstruction, don't go\u201d", "Author": "nobadges", "ReviewID": "UR5772319", "Content": "As much as we have enjoyed the Monte Carlo Hotel, its rooms, service, and best of all pools, over the years, I have to say stay away during construction.

The pool area was nice but very crowded. There are shady spots tucked in the corner near the towel area if you'll walk around. The pool bar was very unorganized in helping people.

We\u2019ve all been to Vegas many times before. ARRIVAL ~ We arrived at the Monte Carlo around 9PM on Friday evening. We did Valet. We tipped VERY well (this came in handy later on\u2026) CHECK-IN ~ A breeze. No problems. Very friendly staff member. We were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving at the hotel. NOTE: I had brought my laptop with me. The bell guys will not take your laptop on the luggage cart. I was OK with bringing it in with me. Once in our room, called for our luggage, and our luggage was there within 10 minutes. Again, very friendly staff member. ROOMS ~ Very nice, basic hotel room. We had a room with two beds (for 4 adults, we were 2 couples). Not a very interesting d\u00e9cor, but nice overall. We were on the 9th floor and had a view facing southeast, with mountains in the background and the rear of Excalibur/New York, New York. Everything in the room was in working order. The only thing I would mention about the room is that our shower did not drain well at all. After just a few minutes in the shower, I was standing in a puddle of water at least 2-3 inches deep. Then the next person would get in, and the water would get deeper, and so on. With 4 adults sharing one room, you do the math! Also, the sink in the bathroom had the same problem. It was a very slow drain. Also, as a female, it was a very small sink\u2026hard to wash your face. It was small and difficult to bend over and splash water on your face\u2026girls\u2026you know what I\u2019m talking about! There was also a hairdryer in the bathroom. The only thing we missed in the room\u2026a coffee pot would have been nice. We would also have liked a small refrigerator. But overall, the room was nice enough. NOISE ~ We had no problems with noise. Of course, we could hear our neighbors showering or flushing, but nothing extraordinary. No complaints. FOOD ~ The first night, we just wanted to grab something to eat quickly before hitting the strip. We first stopped by the Monte Carlo Pub & Brewery. It was PACKED. Instead, we went to the food court. Bad decision. My husband and I got a piece of pizza from Sbarro. It was BAD. And the 2 guys working there were rude and slow and not friendly at all. Our friends got some food from Nathans\u2026their food was BAD as well\u2026and expensive! $12 for some wings and fries. Not worth it. On Saturday morning, I went down to go to Starbucks around 12:30 PM and the line was LOOOOOOOOONG! Decided against that. On Sunday morning, we went to one of the restaurants (I don\u2019t remember the name, but it wasn\u2019t the buffet, it was a sit-down restaurant.) We went for breakfast. It was a-la-carte. It was very good. Very nice service as well. Approximately $20 per person for breakfast. LOCATION ~ GREAT! No complaints here! Right next door to Excalibur. New York, New York, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Paris, Ballys, Bellagio\u2026all of these hotels are within easy walking distance. I was really very happy with the location. AMENITIES ~ I was disappointed. On Saturday morning, we were out of the room by 11AM. The two guys went down to play, us girls decided to hit the pool. We got all ready, walked down to the pool, and were very disappointed. We walked around the entire area and could not find 2 chairs together (we didn\u2019t even see 1 chair available anywhere!) There were lots of open chairs, but they all had towels on them or stuff on them (they were all being used, not just a fresh towel laying on them). We decided not to waste anymore time\u2026we\u2019ll go get massages instead. So, we go back up to our room, call down to the Spa to schedule 2 massages\u2026they are booked up for the entire day! So, needless to say, we were very disappointed, but we understood. VALUE ~ We ended up paying $159 for Friday night and $179 for Saturday night. When I was checking rates, for 4 adults in 1 room, the rate was higher ($219/night). I fibbed and only claimed 2 adults per room to get the lesser rate. We had no problems. No one ever questioned me. I don\u2019t recommend this to anyone, but it worked for us! I definitely think these rates were very fair. CHECK-OUT ~ On Sunday morning, we checked out. Check-Out time is 11AM. We did the Express Check-Out on the TV. We called down to have someone come get our luggage for us. We had a staff member in our room about 15 minutes later. He, also, was very nice. He took our luggage and had it stored for us (since we didn\u2019t plan on leaving town for a few more hours). NOTE: I had brought my laptop with me. Again, the bell guys will not take a laptop on the carts. Instead, he told me I could bring it down to the Bell Desk myself and put it in a locker (with a key) until I was ready to leave. I did. Once there, no one ever touched it\u2026I did everything myself. I walked it into the back room and placed it in the locker and closed and locked the locker, all myself (with a staff member watching me, of course). I liked this, because I KNEW that I was the only one handling the laptop the entire time. When I picked it up, same thing. I unlocked the locker and took it out, all myself. DEPARTURE ~ A few hours later, we were ready to go. Remember I said we tipped VERY well to the Valet when we first arrived? Well, they \u201chave their ways\u201d to remember that. We were told it would be 20-30 minute wait for our car (there were a TON of people outside waiting to depart). However, we got our car within 5 minutes. (What they did for us is on the part of the ticket that we had, they had made a little symbol on it. When we turned it in, they see this symbol and know that we tipped well, so they hurry to get our car. We then tip THEM very well.) We\u2019ve done this everywhere and it ALWAYS works for us! OVERALL ~ A very nice hotel. Not too big, not too small. Clean, basic room. Good food (stay away from the Food Court!) Very nice staff members. Good value. Stay, enjoy!

The clerk said that the coupons didn't show up on our booking, but we had brought along a print out of our e-ticket, so she said she would give them to us. They included a 2 for 1 breakfast buffet, a 2 for 1 inner-tube rental for the wave pool/lazy river (they normally rent them for $12/day!!!! You are better off buying a cheap $6 one at the CVS drugstore next store) and a couple others we didn't use. We ate at the breakfast buffet most mornings and it was quite good (the waffles in particular!). We didn't eat at any of the other hotel restaurants. The best part of the hotel was the pool area. There is a pool, a wave pool and a lazy river (which isn't so lazy, it has quite a pull!). We spent 2-3 hours a day poolside. The temperature was 38-43 everyday, so we were glad to see there was a large area to the left shaded by the hotel building. We went everyday at around 9:30am and could always get 2 chairs together. We highly recommend doing this. Another huge plus of the Monte Carlo is the location. It is right next to the New York, New York, MGM Grand and a short walk to the Bellagio. Only having to walk short distance is very important, especially during the day. Things we did outside of the MC: - Ate at Gonzales Y Gonzales at the NY, NY: Excellent. - Ate at Chin Chins at the NY,NY: Good. - Ate at L'Ile St. Louis at the Paris: Very Good. - Had desert crepes at Le Creperie at the Paris: Very Good. - Ate at Quark's at the Hilton: Ok, but overpriced. - Saw the Lion Habitat (free and starts at 4:15pm daily) at the MGM: Recommended - Went to the new Atomic Testing Museam (short cab ride from MC): Recommended if you're into history. - Went to Love, the new Cirque du Soliel show based on the music of the Beatles: Highly recommended (the theatre is small, so any tickets have a good view). We would definitely stay at the MC again if we saw if offered at a good price again.

Our first room did not have a view of the strip so I called down to the front desk and less than 10 minutes later we were walking into our new room with a fabolus view of the strip. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and costs about $10 a person but there is also a Mcdonalds in the food court if saving money on meals is a concern to you. Also for that early morning cup of joe there is a Star bucks also in the food court. For lunch I recommend the buffet at the MGM Grand (across the street) which is $20 a person but I have never seen so much food before. I think they had just about everything The pool was marvelous and they have a full spa but we didnt make any use of the spa. The room was not bad at all very spacious bathrooms, comfortable beds, maybe the tv's could have been a little bigger but this is vegas who sits in their room watching tv anyway. Also make sure you get a view of the strip and not of the massive parking lot because the parking lot is boring to look at which is why we changed to a room with a view of the strip. If they dont have any rooms with a view of the strip get one with a view of the pool that is also nice. There is a CVS next door and a Walgreens across the street which came in handy for things like pop and snacks which were priced high in the hotel.

I had mixed feelings about the staff, rooms, restaurants, and amenities offered at the hotel. Staff: Overall the staff was nice enough. The check-in/check-out staff was not exactly nice, and rather abrupt, however efficient. The overall process of checking-in/out was painless and brief. My father and I had booked separate rooms and were able to at least get rooms on the same floor and hallway. At the spa I found the service the same(at the front desk): abrupt and snappish, but painless and efficient. The great service we received from the staff was definately from the casino workers and bartenders. The dealers were awesome and the bartenders were truly friendly, nice people. Rooms: Clean and functional. Comfortable beds, but the pillows were weird. I heard no construction noise, but one could easily hear noise from the hallway and your neighbor's bathroom. My shower drain didn't work well, but my dad had no problems and absolutely loved the bed, as he told me several times. I may be spoiled, but I cannot remember the last time I stayed at a hotel that didn't offer free internet access. The monte Carlo wanted ten dollars a day. I chose against giving the hotel this amount of money for using my laptop. Restaurants: Ate at the buffet twice and thought the food was good. Drink service was a little slow the first time, but the waiter was friendly and quickly warmed up to us I should tell you that I have been waiting tables for 8 years and I may be a little more observant of what's going on than others. I notice the little things and yet am always extremely polite and, heck, when you are nice to people they are more likely to go out of their way for you. The Brew Pub was pretty good with service being much friendlier at the bar than at the actual tables. The waitress we had for dinner one night was slow getting to the table and then abrupt, rushing through the order and practically running away from us when she thought that we were done ordering. I had to stop her to ask her to add a salad to the meal. Food came out extremely fast after that and she was efficient, just not friendly at all. The brew pub was also serving breakfast while the Cafe was closed for refurbishment. The Cafe being closed was a real disappointment because it is the 24 hour restaurant that is offered by the hotel, serving a wide range of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Amenities: My dad and I didn't use the pool, but did walk around it. Chairs were plentiful. The spa was very nice and offered all the toiletries you could need if showering there. I used the fitness room and found it to be very nice and clean, with windows from which I could see planes taking off from the airport. I did use tha business center to check-in to my departing flight. The charge was $7 for the first fifteen minutes and $1 per copy (I needed to print our boarding passes). Again, I found this to be overpriced. Overall, we had a good time. I don't know if I would stay here again. I certainly didn't win big money at the Monte Carlo, but then, I never do. My dad really liked the hotel, he was happy. I might reserve rooms here again if I could get the same good deal we got which included a bunch of 2-for-1 coupons at the buffet and spa as well as cheap rates.

The hotel is beautiful and classy. The only negative in the lobby was the skimpy floral arrangements that did not match the decor of the hotel. We do like that it is not overwhelming to get around the hotel. Elevators were always available, never too far of a walk to anything within the hotel The casino has no smokey smell. Not much action seemed to be going on. Never heard the sounds of big wins. It was nearly vacant at 2 and 3 in the morning. I lost on slots-stopped putting money in after 40 dollars. My husband won my loss back on a quarter machine. Nothing to write home about. Check in was fast at 8 pm. The staff were not rude, just indifferent. No warm fuzzies here. We chose to check out by television. Glad we did because when we left, there was a line of at least 15 people. Of the 10 to 12 stations, only 3 were open. I would have been steaming if I were in that line. Our room was very clean with up to date decor. Room size was average. The shower had plenty of pressure, but the tub drained extremely slow. Noise was not an issue for us. We did take 2 small fans to drown out noise after reading other travelers advise. We did not eat at any of the food establishments, so can't offer advise. It's worth the drive over to The Orleans for their buffet. Unbeatable price and selections. My teenage daughter used the lazy river pool the day we were going to check out. She came back 2 hours later frustrated that she supposedly had to pay to use a tube to float in, so she floated without a tube. My son and her said the staff down there were useless. I chose not to investigate the tube situation since we were checking out anyway. We saw the Lance Burton show and it was amazing. I do recommend it to others. The girl at the hotel box office was the only warm and friendly person we encountered at the hotel. The rudest person we encountered was the attendent outside at the taxi pick up. Because of construction, curb side pick up was apparently not available. One side of the hotel grounds was under construction and only allowing valet parking to enter. On the second day that entire entrance was closed off. The other entrances were on Las Vegas Blvd. and of course you can't stop there to pick someone up. The only other option was the drive that taxi's went into to pick up people. It was on the side where construction for a new building next door is going on. Out of desparation to pick up my elderly mother at the curb, my husband pulled into the taxi area to pick up mom. The attendent started yelling and screaming at my husband to get out of the area and he could not stop. He literally threw a fit. My husband had no other choice but to ignore him and load mom anyway. The guy continued his ranting and raging. A more professional way to handle this would be to kindly say, \"Sir, you are not allowed in this area, let me give you an alternative way to pick up your family member\". Of course that would take some customer relations training and I am not convinced the Monte Carlo cares much about customer relations. Our room rate was originally going to be a bargain at 79.00 a night. Upon making the reservation, our price jumped to 129.00 because they charge for children-25.00 pp. Beware of this policy.

The bed sheets were dirty with stains and fuzz but the maid quickly replaced them when we arrived and was very apologetic.

Location is great. Lance Burton's show was also a fun time. He is the Master Magician located in the hotel. Three big tips: 1.Use the $5 a day/or $2 a trip Deuce bus line which stops everywhere along the strip including right in front of the hotel when you are hot and can't walk anymore,2.

Also, they should note somewhere that there is no longer a tram to the Bellagio, as there used to be.

I have stayed there before so I might be a little biased but our stay this time was as enjoyable as our stays in the past. We arrived at 8:15 on a Wednesday night, there was no line and we were into our room by 8:25. We requested a room away from the construction with a view and were given a strip view on the 13th floor and never heard a peep of construction. Or a peep from anywhere for that matter. I have read other reviews of thin walls but we never heard anything. No conversation, no toilets flushing, no showers running. Nada. I will agree that the pools are on the small side and the chairs are a bit crowded but we never had a problem finding suitable chairs or shade no matter what time of day we visited the pool. We ate at the Brew Pub and the buffet. Both were average but enjoyable. For what you pay to eat at either you basically get what you pay for. Decent food at a decent price. Speaking of the Brew Pub, if Purple Reign (Prince tribute band) is playing, you MUST GO! They are excellent and an absolute riot to see live. All in all, the Monte Carlo is a great value (we payed $115 night on average) and we'll certainly stay there again.

It was fairly inconsequential. The casino was welcoming and not too terribly smoky. The wave pool was fantastic!! It was 110 degrees when we there. we would spend a couple of hours a day sitting on the edge of the pool, just having the waves break over our legs. It was great. Get out early to get a lounge chair, especially if you want a padded one in the shade. The food at the breakfast buffet was good. Fruit was delicious. We had dinner at the brewery because we had coupons for free drinks. The food was very good, a nice change from some of the heavier meals we had been having. The food court has a Mcdonald's, which was great for getting cold bottle water and diet cokes during the day - cheaper than buying it in the hotel stores. Check their website for specials. I did and was able to save $20 a night just by calling and telling them that their rate on the web was cheaper than what I had originally booked. They also gave us coupons for the drinks and the breakfast buffet. One other great thing, right across the street is a half price ticket outlet. we went there the day of the show and were able to get tickets to see Mama Mia for half price.

We had also stayed there during the summer of 2005. This year we stayed June 21 - June 26. We actually rented a car this year and arriving at the Monte Carlo from the airport is very easy. You can use the Valet, but the parking garage is very close and we were always able to find a spot close to the hotel entrance. Check in was easy and fast. However, our flight was late so we checked-in at midnight, and I would be very surprised to see a line at that time. You could tell on Thursday and Friday night that there was a line for check in, and I can easily see a 30 minute wait. We purchased our rooms back in February, and the Monte Carlo had some of the best prices for the week. If you book online, be sure to check the prices every so often. The week before we arrived some of the room rates went down and we were able to call and save $120. Customer service is very friendly and they were more than happy to help find a lower rate. Since we saved some money on our rooms we decided to upgrade to the suite. The Suites are similar to the regular rooms, but the extra space, safe in the room, two bathrooms, couch and table with chairs, are nice add-ons if you are going to be there for more than a couple of nights. The walls are still thin, and you can hear your neighbors if they are loud. The pool has changed a bit. They added Cabanas, but while we were there they were mostly empty, except for a few in the back corner that had corporate groups. The already cramped pool area is even smaller with these new Cabanas. They also seem to be getting a bit cheap around the pool. In the past you could bring your own raft and they would happily inflate it for you. This year we were told that they are no longer aloud to inflate outside rafts. It can't be a manpower issue b/c there were 4 life guards sitting in the raft rental station, and they made you feel like you were interupting their conversation. If this is there way of trying to get to you to rent their rafts, then I am truly worried about the financial condition of the hotel if they are tyring to make their money on raft rentals at the pool. Also, I was told I could only have 1 towel. I quickly got back in line and they gave me another? At 6'2\", one towel does not cut it on the hot chairs. I saw a lot of people using their shirts under their legs since they were only given 1 towel. Although it seems they are tyring to be more upscale at the pool, cheaping out with towels and rafts really made it less enjoyable. (At least the empty cabanas look nice.) The casino is nice, but small. The slots are tight and we never seem to win. The slots seem looser at New York New York and the Aladdin. We were actually able to find plenty of $5 blackjack this year. We were even able to find an empty $5 table at 11:00 pm on Friday night. We played again on Sunday, and had no problem finding a $5 table. The Brew Pub still has great beer and food, but the service was even slower than I remembered. There are a ton of open tables, but they still make you wait 15 to 20 minutes. At peak time I understand, but there was always a wait. Overall, it's a decent low price option on the strip.

We actually checked out a day early and won't be staying here again. ROOMS: I guess the best way to describe the rooms were small, tired and not very clean. It doesn't look like any updates or remodeling have been done since the place was built. Linens were worn and stained, and were only changed once during our 3-day stay. The carpet, tile, tub and grout was stained and worn. Our room also faced the highway and they were doing construction in the back parking lot so there was noise at all hours (especially at night). POOL: The pool area has too much going on in a very small area, and was VERY crowded. SERVICE: Most of the staff we encountered was friendly and courteous. Our Bell persons were especially helpful. However, we had an incident one night with a group of smoker's who were loitering near our room for several hours. They were very loud, at times screaming at each other, and were smoking enough that we actually had smoke coming into our room. We gave them a couple of hours to clear out before we contacted the Front Desk. It took two calls and nearly 2 hours before Security turned up, and by then the offenders had finally left with only the piles of ashes in the hallway to substantiate our complaint. The staff never told us what, if anything, they were going to do about the complaint and never followed up with us. THE PUB: The menu had changed since we visited last but still had a nice variety of options. The food is okay, definitely edible by Vegas standards, just a bit cold much like the food you would get from room service. Service has always been slow, one night it took nearly 30 minutes for us to get our check.

BUT he could have stopped there, but continued to suggest that if we wanted we could request a better room around 12 noon the following day. The initial room was GREAT, it was very comfortable, NO \"thin walls\" or noise and the view wasn't that bad. However we thought what did we have to lose by requesting a better room so the kids could have a view. The next day we did and our request was processed without any delay and we were given a GREAT view of the strip.

I loved the hotel itself. Valet parking was convenient both in and out. Check in was pretty quick even at 3:30 in the afternoon. The elevators to the rooms are convenient and plentiful -- though they could add some cool air or ventilation to them. Just off the elevators is the sundries shop that I believe stays open 24 hours. There is a food court very close to the elevators if you just want a quick snack or some coffee first thing in the morning (no coffee maker in the rooms). Food court includes: McDonald's, Hagen Daas Ice Cream, Nathan's Hot Dogs and Cheesesteaks (which has a quick, delicious breakfast, too!), Sbarro Pizza, and Starbuck's. There is a nice shop in the same area called \"Indulge\" -- all kinds of clothing, shoes and accessories. There is also a pub with a microbrewery in that same area. The pool access is located near the elevators, as well. Having three different pools was a nice feature -- we didn't try the lazy river or wave pool, but enjoyed the regular pool. Chairs can be hard to come by -- especially if you want one that has some shade. The casino was nice and not so large that you couldn't find others in your party if you needed to -- I didn't win, but isn't that how they build all those wonderful hotels in Vegas?!?!? The Cafe was very good! I tried the rib-eye steak and was very impressed with it -- I normally eat steak only in upscale restaurants that serve prime beef, so it was a pleasant surprise to find a nice cut of beef for only about $17-$18. Others I was traveling with said their food was also delicious at The Cafe. If I could rate the hotel/resort on the basis of these things alone, I would gladly give it about 4 1/2 stars -- lots of things to really like from a convenience standpoint. Here's the reason that I only gave it a 3 Star rating -- the rooms were barely a 3 as far as I am concerned. I have stayed in all sorts of hotels from Ritz-Carltons and Four Seasons on down to Comfort Inns and Holiday Inns, so I feel like I know a little about hotel class ratings. The amenities in the room barely qualified it as a 3 Star. There was no in-room safe, no mini-bar/fridge, no robes, no coffee maker. There was a hair dryer and an iron and ironing board. The \"closet\" didn't have a door -- it was just a nook with a bar and some hangers. The bathroom was average, with a loud flushing toilet and a tub that drained very slowly. The real problem was the thin walls that are the number one complaint from other reviewers here on this site. You could easily hear the conversations in the next room. Our friends had a room down the hall from us and said they heard the person in the next room coughing all night long. And, then there's that dreaded construction that is going on 24/7. We were awakened the first morning at 6:20 AM by jackhammers pounding away and that awful beep-beep-beep-beep sound of heavy equipement backing up. We asked to be moved (along with our friends) and the front desk was very accommodating. We were moved later that day (from the 12th floor to the 17th floor) -- we could still hear the noise, but it was less than before and I was able to sleep with earplugs in. If you are a light sleeper then I wouldn't recommend staying at Monte Carlo. If not, there are lots of things to love about it.

During our stay we also tried the buffets at the MGM and the Stratosphere, and both were poor in comparison. * The rooms are quite large and ours was clean and well maintained by the maids. * Sorry to hark back on food, but there is an Italian restaurant inside the Monte Carlo (can't think of the name) which is fantastic. The staff are also very friendly. * The pool area is quite sizable and nice. * The casino itself isn't as big as some of the others, but it had everything you need. * The brew pub is a nice addition. Bad: * Not sure if this is a regular occurrence in Vegas Hotels, but whilst gambling early one morning around 3am, I did receive quite a few invitations from women for...um...company, so to speak. * The casino gaming floor doesn't seem too smokey while walking through it. Yet once you get back to your room your clothes are sometimes putrid. * The drink service at the slots can be a bit slow during peak times, but I guess that's to be expected. * We were there in April and one day it was very hot so we went to the pool. We struggled a bit to find lounge chairs so I can imagine in Summer it would be nigh on impossible to get a chair. * I know they don't want you in your room much, but there was no fridge or kettle in our room.

The Monte Carlo isn't as big and doesn't offer all the attractions (clubs, themes, etc.) that the other hotels may offer but what you get in return is a nice, pleasant, atmosphere w/out the circus. The ventilation in the casino was fabulous (the best if you ask me) and the hotel always smelled very fresh. I found their slots to be cold so I didn't do much gambling their (I had much better luck at New York and The Mermaid (downtown). One thing I especially liked about the Monte Carlo was in addition to the restaurants, there was also an inexpensive food court which housed a McDonalds, Sbarro, an Ice Cream parlor and one other restaurant which was good. I only ate at the buffet for breakfast ($11.50) and the food was good. They had three pools (lazy river, wave pool and reg. pool) that were all operating. Although I didn't get a chance to swim, it looked as if everyone else really enjoyed it. The room was a comfortable size and the bed was extremely comfortable--although they could use bigger pillows. The bathroom was roomy (the toilet flushed extremely loud and the shower water was extremely strong). I did find that the walls where pretty thin (thank goodness only one room next to us was occupied and they were pretty quiet). Our rooms were cleaned every day in a timely manner. The Monte Carlo is in a pretty good location (between NY and Bellagio and right next door to CVS Pharmacy) but definitely a nice walk to the more central hotels. Bally's would be considered central strip area. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS they have construction going 24/7 right next to the hotel and if you stay on the pool side (and you are a light sleeper), you will not get any sleep at all!! I called the first night and they offered to change our room but we ended up staying. In the end, they gave us a discount of the upgraded amount ($60) for our inconvenience. I was told the construction will continue until 2010! Other than that, I have nothing negative to say about the hotel and will definitely stay there again.

You're not checking in - in the middle of the Casino. Much to our delight, our room was ready early. The room was very clean and spacious. We didn't have the best view - but we didn't plan on spending much time in our room. The pool area is very nice - I would recommend getting down there early. By 11:00 am - all prime spots were taken. The pool is a good size - plus there's a wave pool and a lazy river. Of course one word of advice - sunblock! There are several choices for sit down dining. The food court also has several fast food choices. We did the champagne brunch one morning - the variety was incredible. The food was very good and didn't taste like your typical buffet food. If you love pizza - you must try one of the stonebrick oven pizzas from the Pub - they're to die for! As far as entertainment - if you want to dance - you won't really find a place to do that here. However, the great thing about the location - you're right next to NY, NY and you can find all the nite life you want. We did, however, have a great time listening to the sultry voice of Tammie Graham - in the Houdini Lounge - an old fashioned piano bar. She's a lot of fun! If you like Micro-brews - I would highly recommend spending some time at the Pub. The Las Vegas Lites go down pretty easy! We had a late flight - on the day of our departure. When we checked in, I had inquired about a late check-out. I was told I would have to call the front desk on the day of our departure, that it would be based on occupany and the fees could vary. Much to our delight - we were able to stay in our room until 4:00 pm - for an extra $38. I would definitely recommend this hotel/casino! ...a side note - if you love lobster - and money isn't an object - I highly recommend \"The Rosewood Grille\" - it's located on the other side of the street - just down to the left of Walgreens. ...and if you love a good reuben sandwich - you'll not find a better one - than what they serve at the NY, NY Deli.

We have stayed at many places in Vegas and this is our new favorite. Are there better hotels in Vegas? Yes I am sure there are if you want to spend 3 or 4 times the $$ per night. We stayed M - Th for an average nightly rate of $69. I challenge you to find a better value on the strip. Our original rate was booked months in advance at $109. The week prior to departure I noticed online that the rate had dropped to the rate above. I called and politely asked if they would honor the new rate. They said of course they would. At that time, I also told the reservations agent that we were celebrating our anniversary and would appreciate a strip view or upgrade if available. They said they would be glad to give us a strip upgrade if available. We arrived at about 1030 pm and found absolutely no line at check in. We were pleasantly surprised to find they had pre-assigned our room to a 25th floor room with a view of the strip from MGM down to the flamingo with just a corner of the Bellagio fountains in the view. The room was nice. Not huge, but adequate with a nice bathroom and very nice toiletries provided. We loved the layout of this hotel. Very easy to get around in and not to large like so many of the Vegas properties. The pool area is not the fanciest in Vegas, but it was very nice and there were always lounge chairs available in either sun or shade at any given point in the day. We ate at Blackstones Steakhouse for our anniversary and had a wonderful meal, and the Brew Pub was a great place to have a beer and catch a game. Never a problem with seating or service here. We also went to Lance Burton and enjoyed the show very much...would especially be good if travelling with children. As for gambling, the dealers in this hotel were as friendly as any I encountered anywhere in Vegas on this trip. I didnt win, but it was a nice place to play. Only one complaint and it was a temporary problem. The first morning the construction noise did start early, but it was not noticable for long and was only that one day. They are destroying the Boardwalk next door. There are not very many places in Vegas where there is not construction going on. If you want the Ritz, you should stay there...or maybe at Bellagio and expect to pay $200 -300 a night.

Also, we were not told that the resort has become a \"construction\" site! We were not told of the vast extent of surrounding construction: Dust, noise and explosions at all times of the day/night. I would not recommend for this reason alone! The tennis court facility was also shut down - with beach chairs filling the courts! In addition, the front desk workers seemed cold and disgruntled. One young lady told us that the Monte Carlo had been sold to MGM properties and many changes were going on. (not all positive!) We noted that during our stay.

They upgraded us to a mini suite which was faboulous on the 28th floor. The room was big with a bar, sofa, jacuzzi in the bedroom, nice view of the mountains. We did have problems with the a/c and they came and changed the filter and fixed it. The bed was comfy. We were able to get a wheelchair for the whole stay and that was included in the amenities. All you have to do is sign for it and not lose it. It was hard pushing the wheelchair in the hotel with the rugs and outside the push was very difficult with the heat and the construction going on. It was a long walk to the other sites. The Coke/M&M store is across the street and worth the walk. The buffet in the hotel is not worth it. I was not impressed at all but the CAFE food was good. Theservice at 2AM is very slow and we had to wait but that was alright. We had breakfast room service and it was great. It was well worth the extra price and a real treat as my sis never had room service before. The play in the casino was good to us. We won at the $5 slot machine and wheel of fortune slots. We were able to survive without losing. The STEAKHOUSE was great. We had filet mignon, baked ptotatos, corn, salade, and soda and it was about $125 with tip. The service was great as was the atmospherre. You can be casual dressed but no tank tops. It is worth it. The shower in the bathroom was large and spacious with average water pressure and it was always the right temp as you needed it. Ice machines are on each floor and the suite had robes for us. We had a mini fridge and a nice area to walk around in. The stores inside werent that great. There was really nobargains. I suggest the Desert Passage at the Aladdin which was good. They are really some nices stores and restaurants there. what is nice about the Monte Carlo is the fact that you dont have too many people crowding the lobby and you can get in and out easy.

Let me start by saying that our first impressions were excellent. Check in was very smooth and our room was ready for us there and then. The room itself was bigger than we expected and well furnished. Nice bed, Nice bathroom, generally pleasant decor. We didn't have a particularly great view, overlooking the building site on what used to be the Boardwalk. You need to be aware if you are on this side of the hotel that the building work goes on pretty much 24 x 7, but on the 21st Storey it didnt really impact us that much. Also this building work means the monorail link to the Bellagio is gone, which must have been a blow to the hotel. We chose the Monte Carlo for two reasons, we wanted a real strip hotel and we wanted to be somewhere near the centre. That ruled out places like the Stratosphere and the Monte Carlo was the cheapest of the rest. Location wise it did fit the bill, being close to several other hotels. We were pleasantly surprised by the casino in the Monte Carlo, it had a nice feel to it. Not too big , well lit and spacious. The bars were also really nice, especially Houdini's bar which had a great relaxed atmosphere. Also the floor drink service was good, pretty regular and nice drinks. So now to the but side. I've mentioned the poor view above which could be an issue. We were dissapointed with the quality of the housekeeping. The room wasn't dirty but things like glasses were taken and not replaced, rubbish wasnt taken..minor details but not what you really expect in a place like this. The Air Con was not good at all, which in 100 degree heat was a real problem, the room was permanently hot. Finally we had a room with an adjoining door which meant that we could hear every noise from next door. Particularly bad at 6am when a family was getting ready next door.

We picked week days as the less busiest time. Check in was smooth and we received a room with a great strip view on the 17th floor. We loved the aroma of the lobby. It smelled like fresh cut flowers piped through the ventilation system. The lagoon pool was a little small for the amount of rooms/people and we were disappointed that the lazy river was down for maintenance the first 2 days there which made the other pools seem even more crowded. There were lots of families with kids by the pools. There are not enough chairs around the pool for everyone needing them and we saw a few selfish people who would come early in the morning to place towels on several chairs taking up several in a row with no intentions of being at the pool for a few hours. This left those who were there ready to swim to stand around even though many seats were unattended for hours. This caused a disturbance one day when seats had been vacant for almost two hours as if abandoned and someone who needed them sat in them. After a while, an English-accented woman claimed someone took her \"reserved\" seats & created a scene with an man holding a child. With digusting cursing and vulgarness between them, we thought security might come in case of a fight but they finally parted. She continued to rant however for at least an hour afterward like a spoiled child to anyone who was within ears shot of her, stating how \"RUDE\" other people were to take \"HER\" chairs that she had come down early that morning to save for later (whenever she decided to come down to the pool). There isn't enough chairs for everyone in the first place. If she had taken the time to read, there is a sign at the pool stating that chairs left unattended for more than an hour would be considered \"abandoned\" and would have to be given up. Evidently, she didn't care that there were others wanting to use the pool while she was out doing other things. The slots were very tight and I came back deep in the hole. We didn't go many other places to gamble, just to sightsee a day and one night. Don't gamble at MC if you play the slots! My husband broke even at the roulette tables but ended up with enough comps for two tickets to shows, a free room night and a $30 meal at the Cafe. The Buffet's breakfast buffet was fabulous and the lunch buffet there was good too. We had planned on going to Fremont street one night, but my husband wanted to cash in on the $30 Cafe comp meal so we went to the MC Cafe that night instead. Mistake! I had the Salmon with soup which was fresh & very good. He had the ribeye with salad. He said he's grilled out steak at home better. We finished eating around 7 p.m. and by 10 p.m. my husband started feeling ill. From midnight on thoughout the rest of our stay he spent every 5 minutes running to the bathroom with symptoms of food poisioning. He has never been that sick in his life! I had to go to CVS pharmacy next door for Immodium AD & Gatorade. The pharmacist said he should go to the Urgent Clinic with his severe symptoms, but he didn't even feel up to getting dressed and getting a taxi. He had to stay in bed the rest of our trip. Vegas isn't too much fun alone, so my vacation was over also. We never made it to Fremont Street or other places I wanted to visit. I called the food management staff to see if anyone else had reported getting sick and of course they said, \" No\". They sent someone up from security to fill out an incident report (they made my husband fill it out himself even though he could barely hold his head up). They brought him some bottled water and toast as their only gesture. That was the most they said they could do and didn't even offer provide a ride or cab to the Urgent clinic but suggested he go anyway. That was the last we heard from them. I believe it was improper handling of his salad since I had the soup rather than the salad and I didn't get sick. His steak looked cooked throughout & there was no pink in the middle. The only other thing he had eaten all day was in their food court (a Big Mac and two apple pies around 11:00 that morning). Being sick, the 4 hr. plane ride home wasn't very fun for him either. Overall, except for the food poisioning and tight slots, the hotel itself was very nice for the price we paid. Next time, however, I would like to try New York, New York (for the casino size and variety of food/entertainment) or stay closer to the middle of the strip in order to visit more places with less of walk (it was 103 degrees one day). If it wasn't for the food poisioning, I'd give the Monte Carlo a thumbs up just for the atmosphere. Two days later and my husband still can't eat without getting sick.

Also, this hotel isn't themed so if that's what your after then don't go to Monte Carlo. I didn't mind that it wasn't themed. I thought Monte Carlo was elegant and classy and that's why I really think it's good value.

If you need internet access, go across the street. The business center is expensive. $1 per page to print and I can't recall how much for internet for 15 mins. The buffet resturant is good for breakfast. it's $10 per person but we didn't eat lunch after breakfast. They serve freshely made eggs, fruits, yougurt, your regular American style breakfast with sausage, etc. waffels, hashbrowns, pancakes and other goodies.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cViva Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Redjazz68", "ReviewID": "UR5232722", "Content": "The Monte Carlo is a beautiful hotel and casino located in the heart of the strip.

Bathroom was a good size with a bath/shower combo. Had breakfast at the buffet one morning which was very good. Dinner in the buffet one night was okay but we had better buffets at Rio and Paris on other nights. Visited a number of different casinos on the strip. Paris was a particular favorite with a ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower ... great views. Bellagio Fountains are a MUST see. We saw at least 6 different \"shows\", in the evening they are less than 15 minutes apart. We just did not have enough time to see all the free stuff let alone a paid show and we were there 6 days. It was REALLY hot, 98 most days so that made it tough. The Deuce bus is good during the day to get up and down the strip but it is HORRENDOUS at night. Walk, it is quicker and less frustrating. Shopping outlets centres are great, we spent a lot of time and money but got great value for money. Did a helicopter ride and landing in the Grand Canyon, if you can afford it, do it, I do not have the words to describe standing in the Grand Canyon looking up !!! Overall, loved Las Vegas.

This was our 3rd trip to Vegas but our 1st stay at MC. We were very pleased with our choice. We are in our mid-twenties and it was pretty much everything we want in a hotel. CHECK-IN & ROOM: Check-in was fast with friendly staff. We upgraded our room to a Monaco Suite. I highly recommend this and it was fairly inexpensive to do (about $130 extra for our whole stay). The Monaco Suite allows you plenty of room to spread out, an extra bathroom, and a whirlpool tub. The bed was super comfy. The only complaint we had was that we could hear the couple in the room next to us. At times we could hear them talking and could hear their TV. We were willing to dismiss this minor annoyance but if you expect to not hear anything from the room next to yours- this might not be the right hotel for you. CASINO: The casino is nice and decently sized but it does not pay out that well. Except for one good run on the craps table we were not that lucky. If you are into slots I would definitely go somewhere else like the MGM, New York New York, or the Excalibur. All are within short walking distance and seem to pay out a lot more with their slot machines. The MC does offer free craps lessons which I highly suggest going to if you have the time. POOL: The pool area was nice but smaller than I expected. We were there during the week so the crowd wasn't bad at all but I can see how in the peak of tourist season it would be way over-crowded. RESTAURANTS: The Brewery provided great food, a fun atmosphere, and moderate pricing. The Cafe' was okay. It is nice that it is open 24 hrs and the food is good but the atmosphere is not that great. The Food Court was nice because it gave you the option of getting just a quick snack at low prices. OVERALL: We enjoyed the MC and would probably stay there again. It seems family oriented which is more our style than the party scene. So, if you are looking for the party/night club scene this is probably not the hotel for you. The location was one of the best parts because it's practically in the middle of the strip and close to a monorail entrace (MGM). There is also a CVS right next to the MC so you can go stock up on snacks, pop, bottled water, or anything else that you may need for your trip at a decent price.", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridgeshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Wifey43", "ReviewID": "UR5077177", "Content": "We stayed at the Monte Carlo from 7th May to 12th May.

We weren't sure what to expect because the Monte Carlo was one of the few resorts we did not explore on our first trip. We chose Monte Carlo because of other people\u2019s reviews, I wanted something maybe a little quieter the then Bellagio and he wanted something easier on the wallet. Check In was a little slow; we booked our trip online and prepaid for 3 nights. Upon check-in we were told that they only had us for 2 nights and that we would have to call and straighten the situation out. We asked for an upgrade to a suite with a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip. We were told that that could be accommodated and we proceeded to our room. The Check in clerk gave use a number to call and try to fix the reservation problem. Our room was on the 26th floor and when we opened the door I was automatically disappointed. No suite, just a small standard room, and yes, it looked out over the strip to the MGM and NYNY with a lovely view of the roof (ugly). No Bellagio, No fountains. We are not the type to make a fuse so we just dealt with it and proceeded to call the number given to us. We were on hold for 38 minutes, when we finally got through we were told we had the wrong number. I made a long distant call home to get a number of the travel agent and phoned them.......along story short our reservation was correct. It was entered wrong on the Monte Carlo end.....should they not have handled this for us? I also phoned the front desk after this to ask if we could get moved to a suite and was told that we would have to Waite till the next morning. After we got everything settled we were determined to not let our room or a mix up ruin our holidays. So we just forgot about the upgrade and decided to stay in our standard room. THE POOL I found the pool area to be a little small. There are 3 pools 1. Lazy River 2. Wave pool 3. Regular pool. There were always chairs we never had a problem getting on even at 1 in the afternoon. Lots of sun and shade options. FOOD We ate at Andre\u2019s, which was amazing, you should try it. We also enjoyed the Brew Pub and the Cafe. It was nice to have dining options at reasonable prices. We were very happy with the options and the service we received here. GAMBELING Not huge gamblers, but lost a bit, did not win anything and never saw anyone win anything. Maybe kind of tight? We ended up enjoying our stay at Monte Carlo, not sure if we would rush back...lots of other places I would like to try first.

I have stayed at $49 motels that provide coffee makers. They charge for internet service, which didn't work until they sent an engineer up to reset something. Overall the service was tolerable. Nothing terrible happened, but definitely not high-class service. While at the pool, we were ignored a couple of times by the cocktail waitress and when we flagged another staff member and asked her to send someone over she acted like we asked her to eat a live poisonous snake...finally after treating us like we were peasants, she agreed to send someone. 20 minutes later, when no one showed, we got up and walked over to the outside bar...it was out of everything but beer. Pool closes at 6pm. I guess since they don't make any money from you sitting by the pool, they want you inside buying $10 drinks in the lounge or gambling in the tightest machines ever. My girlfriend and I have played poker slots and Wheel of Fortune at Reno and Tahoe quite a bit. We usually end up almost even...sometimes up a bit, sometimes down a bit. Not so at the Monte Carlo. We were dumb enough to hope for a change of luck over the weekend, and did nothing but lose. I asked several other gamblers how they were doing...all pretty much the same as us. I am sure the table games are about the same at other casinos, but the slots at the Monte Carlo were money pits. The food was very hit and miss. Stay far away from the buffet, we got there just before they were switching from breakfast to lunch fare, so got to try both. We were very disappointed. Nothing but the made to order omelette was better than edible (barely), and I am not a very picky eater. On the other hand, we enjoyed an incredible meal at the Steakhouse (2 ppl $180). The food at the Steakhouse was much better than average. If your looking for a less expensive meal, try the Cafe. The food was much better in the Cafe than the buffet. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but would not recommend it to anyone expecting to be in a 4 star hotel and be pampered.

The service was good but not great. Reservations are recommended. The service is very good. Check in/out a breeze. Not a long walk from the hotel desk to the elevator lobby to get to your room. Downsides: the standard rooms are ok. The bathroom is on the smallish side with no seperate shower. Pales in comparison to some of the more luxury hotels (i.e. Venetian, Wynn). The bed was comfy and the linens nice. The room seems pretty standard. Nothing to give you a \"wow\" factor. So if you are looking for that - I'd advise look elsewhere or upgrade to the suites. The food court is undergoing some construction - there should be a Starbucks there soon. Will be a nice addition. The brew pub (forget name) is fun. The pool area is nice and includes a wave pool. The location is great - right on the strip - next to NYNY Casino. Downside - there is construction beginning next door. The former Boardwalk hotel/casino will be torn down (or maybe down now) and they are building next door - so maybe some noise/view issues are some time.

The room was clean, neat and decent sized. The water pressure in the shower was low but showering was still fine. The handicap rooms have showers that do not have bathtubs (which I liked) and the shower head is detachable (which I like too).The square bar of soap has some exfoliating pieces inside of it and it hurts your skin when you use it!! That sucked, we had to go next door to CVS and buy bath soap! The hotel has thin walls, most days we could clearly hear water running from showers, people talking,and toilets flushing. Sometimes it would sound as if it was coming directly from our room. This is one big complaint but really our only one. The bed was nice and comfy, slept well. We ate at the Market City Caffe, the service was good, and the food typical run of the mill Italian food. Basically like Bertucci's or Olive Garden quality. The Brew Pub was excellent!!! Good beer from their brewery, good atmosphere, and it's located right in the hotel so you don't have to trek out onto the strip for a good time! Would love to go back there. I'd have to say that the slots were pretty cold here, had much better luck at other casinos. Overall, I'd recommend Monte Carlo to others and I'd even go back there.

On previous trips I have stayed at the Mirage, Bally's, Venetian and Bellagio. My brother suggested Monte Carlo for this trip as it might be a little more low key and suited to my parents' needs. Check in was very fast and friendly. My room rate, which changed each night, ranged from $169 to $199 a night. My parents had a vacation package deal through Continental Airlines and payed considerably less. The room was on the modest side for Las Vegas. It had all the usual hotel amentities and furnishings. The decor wasn't special. Two comments from my parents stood out for me - my mother missed the ability to make coffee in the room and they found the bathroom to be very treacherous. As for the coffee, I reminded her that the hotels don't want you relaxing in your room, they want you in their retaurants or in the casino, spending your money. The bathroom was a problem for me as well - no anti-slip mat or appliques in the tub and no bars to grip in the shower. It had never occurred to us to ask for a handicap room, but I know we will in the future when traveling with my parents. I often rode the elevator to my room on the 21st floor alone and seldom saw anyone in the corridors. Almost no noise at all the entire time of our stay. Housekeeping was excellent - I would often leave my room by 7:30 am and return by 9:00 am to find the room refreshed and restocked down to new bars of soap each day. As walking is difficult for my parents, we spent a great deal of time in the hotel and casino. I actually liked how low key the casino was. Granted we were there mid-week, but the casino at times seemed almost empty (two days later and we would have been smack dab in the middle of the NASCAR crowd, so that weekend might have been very different). Also, the entire hotel seemed to be relatively smoke free. We ate breakfast each morning at the food court - OK, not great choices (Nathan's, McDonalds, etc.) My parents ate dinner in the hotel's \"cafe\" 24 hour restaurant and quite enjoyed it. There are also several upscale restaurants that we didn't have a chance to visit. For extras, such as snacks and bottled water, we walked next door to the CVS (very convenient) or across the street to Walgreens. The employees at the concierge desk were kind of hit or miss. Not much help in getting show tickets - actually no help at all and we acquired them on our own. For other requests, such as monorail schedule and Strip map, they were very accomodating and friendly. There did seem to be some sort of construction going on at the pool and we didn't see anyone in the area using the facilities. I wasn't bowled over by the Monte Carlo and probably wouldn't stay there by my own choice.

The room was not ready until 3pm (as advertised) but we were able to check in everything with the bellman and enjoy our first day. Room: The view was good, the room was pretty standard but very clean and acceptable. The bed was a very comfortable \"pillow-top\" type (similar to the new Marriott mattresses). Yes, we could hear the \"whoosh\" of the toilets being flushed in other rooms but not a big deal. Restaurants: Pub Brewery: Good beer and pub food Buffet: The breakfast buffet was just okay, doesn't compare well with others such as Paris The 24 hour Cafe- decent late night fare (sandwiches, etc.) Casino: We are wimps at gambling and only used the low-end slot machines. We also did the same at 5 other casinos on the strip this trip. We enjoyed the Mone Carlo because it was quieter, kind of like \"coming home\", cleaner air- we never felt impacted by smoke. This was one of the biggest reasons we spent the last part of each night at the MC. Service: We had top notch customer service everywhere we went in the Monte Carlo. Even though we were cheapos with the slots we still had timely bar service. It was also very handy to have the CVS and Walgreens right outside.

Way smaller pools than the mandalay which also has a river and wave pool, and a bit smaller than most other resorts of similar size.

We called and complained for obvious reasons, nothing was missing from the room, just some things moved around, the hotel was pretty good dealing with it after the fact. I wouldn't stay here again, mainly due to the security concerns, the amount of children, and the strip location. I prefer hotels on the block further north, and would take any of those on the strip for around the same price.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cStaying after Thanksgiving weekend\u201d", "Author": "gizmochee", "ReviewID": "UR4153343", "Content": "I stayed at the Monte Carlo after Thanksgiving day and got a great deal.

The casino was not ultra busy as were the other places we visited ..... by the way ... this casino still uses a real keno air bowl to mix and pull the keno balls with ... not a computer as many of the other hotels now use.

New York New York or the pointless opulence of the Bellagio ... it did exactly what it says on the (brochure) label - its not for the younger family ... its not for the 18-30 brigade .. its for those who want decent accomodation, decent gaming areas and `summat to eat' and well presented. Super, smashing, great. So why cant I recommend it then?. Well in one word .. noise. There are other factors ... not many shops (a handful) and some pretty average in house restaurants .. but the noise was the factor that really does detract from one's stay. We'd read about this previously on here(!) and were a tad sceptical about how prolific this problem was - pushing it to the back of our minds til we got there.But there was no denying that it really is a problem. We were awoken the second night about 2 am with next door's television playing loudly ... rang room service who sent up Security to bang on the `offenders' door .. which they did as well!. Each night a similar scenario and by the fourth we'd had enough and complained officially. We were given apologies by the supervisor on duty who admitted that noise IS a problem at the Monte Carlo due to the rooms' design ... great! We were given free breakfast (wow1) as compensation and a room-move to an end-of-corridor placement which solved the problem ... but by then the holiday had only 3 nights remaining and it had put a bit of a damper on things.As I said ... the restaurants are nowt wunnerful. The foodcourt is not the biggest ... the gaming area is fine ... and the rooms themselves are very clean, spacious and appointed ok. The whole hotel is ... Good. Nowt remarkable. Just .. Good. Yes - the Lance Burton theatre (and his show) is very impressive .. yes, the whole building interiorly and exteriorly is `the business' ... nevertheless unless you are deaf, a very heavy sleeper or an insomniac then we simply cannot put hand on heart and recommend the Monte Carlo. Its a nice place. Its a lot smarter, more subtle and classier than most of the other `Strip hotels and shuns away from the gaudy and brash to present a restrained and more `mature' frontage.Great. So if thin walls with negligible sound insulation allowing the tones of a gnat's fart to pass through doesnt bother you then we'd otherwise wholeheartedly and unreservedly say \"go for it, Roger\". As things are though .. it has to be \"No way, Raymond\". Pity really. Such a daft oversight and a rectification that will probably be an insurmountable one .. now the place has been built. D'oh!.

I have gone to many of the ones on the Strip and I think that they have a wider varity. Also, their dealers definitely leave something to be desired. I learned Black Jack a year ago and find it can be one of the best experiences if the dealer is friendly and outgoing. The table follows suit. The dealers here are completely uninvolved.

Also, a big complaint I have is with the staff. First let me say that politically I am a liberal. However, when hotels hire staff who are not naturally English speaking, they should make sure that they are somewhat literate in English before they begin work.

The manager managed to give us a late check-out until 6:00 which I was very appreciative. But it took us over one hour to straighten this out.

I cannot say enough about Vegas. My girlfriends and I are in our twenties and we partied til we couldn't party anymore and that was until oh about 5 or 6am as I remember or should I say what I can remember. It was aewsome. Ok so here is the scoop. We needed a nice hotel that allowed us to get some sun, some decent food that would refuel our grumbling tummies after we drank way too much Tequilla, etc, and a nice bed to pass out on at the wee hours of the morning. We got it all and then some. We checked in on Friday early evening and the service was great. We asked for a quiet room away from the elavators, with a view and thats what we got. We were on the 13th floor at the end of the hall-way and the view was great. And for those of you who think it is a bad omen to stay on the 13th floor of a hotel have been saddly misinformed or at least at this hotel, because we couldn't have asked for a better floor to be on. Maybe that is because no one wants to stay on floor 13th, but we were happy. We never heard any pipes or toilets flushing at all. The beds were wonderful. The maid service was great. We just left a little note the first day and asked for lots of extras (towels, soaps, etc) and then left $3.00 a day and we had everything we could ask for. Sure Monte Carlo was a little more quiet than alot of the other big hotels, but it was nice to come back to after being out and partying all night. The cafe was hard to get service at around 5am in the morning, but we weren't upset we just stumbled across the street from the hotel and got fast food at a food court which I wouldn't suggest at 5 or 6am, but we are still alive to talk about it, so why not. You only live once. We really didn't want to spend a ton of money on the hotel we stayed at but we wanted to be right on the strip and in the midst of all the fun. We were very happy to find the tram that took us right to the Belligio where we got VIP access to The Light Nightclub. Oh and by the way the Tram is very nice and free. One of the guys who worked there gave us free passes to walk right to the front of the long line and walk right in to The Light! Yeah! We felt like superstars! From the Bellagio we stumbled to Caesars Palace which has the nightclub Pure and we got bumped up in line and right in as well. Its wonderful being a girl and they must not have thought we were to hard on the eyes either since we got right in and the wait was quite long. The casino was very nice, we did very little gambling but the air was clean and we smelled no smoke at all. The hotel was very clean and the little shop inside (can't remember the name) was fun and had great shoes and accessories. I bought a hot silver pair that no one has been able to match back in Chicago. They were very original. We were even allowed late check-out with no charge at the Monte, so we slept late Monday and then headed for the airport.

SIMPLY put for me this is the best hotel in Vegas, not the biggest or 5 stars or the brightest but it works for the following reasons, location it is a short walk on the south end of the strip for MGM, NYNY, Excaliber, Tropicana, Luxor and tram from Excaliber to MB. Also a close walk to Aladdin and the MONTE Carlo has a tram to Bellagio. Another reason is the MOnte is managable in size the casino is a bit smaller then others but still has all the same games, there is a great food court right at the bottom of the elevators, you dont have to walk to through the casino to get to the pool area and perhaps the last reason is this hotel is not a tourist attraction it is a beautiful 3.5 star hotel and at the end of the day when you have had enough of people its nice to get back to this hotel. We stayed in a Monico suite on the third floor. The room was very spacious about 500 sq feet. We gor there at 10 am on Sat oct.22 and were able to get our room then. By far the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We did not experience any excesive noise plumbing noise that others have said.

For frame of reference, as far as hotels go most Hampton Inns provide all of the amenities we prefer in a hotel room. Check-in was fairly straight forward and quick. While there were dozens of people milling around near the checkin, we walked right up to an available employee and were able to check in immediately even though it was a Friday on a 3 day holiday weekend. The room we were given was a handicapped accessible room. The bathroom was very big, but it wasn't a wise use of space. The tub was small and shallow as you'd expect in a HC room, but the hand held shower was abysmal. We called getting washed 'taking a drizzle' it was so bad. The bedroom was nicely decorated though the room smelled of an overpowering deodorizer. We had to crack the window (that's all it did, crack slightly) but it was a windy day so the room aired out quickly. We had a decent view looking up the Strip. Unfortunately the windows were deperately in need of a washing. Given this was our third hotel with filthy windows, I began to wonder if there just werent' any window washers in Vegas. Important note, there is Internet access in the room, but no wireless access. There is also no coffee maker in the room...a definitive -2 stars in our book. The casino looked like we'd expected a european themed casino would look...slightly classier than most of what we had seen on the Strip. But, the gambling was still the same as anywhere else. We only ate at the Cafe while staying here. On the first day we ate dinner, both getting the \"Steak Sandwich\" dinner for about $10. The steak was a little gristly, and perhaps a bit too tough for a sandwich, but it was tasty, and came with a 1/2 plate of greasy but crunchy shoe-string fries. We ate breakfast there the next morning...the over-easy eggs were a touch undercooked, the biscuits and gravy a bit light on the sausage and on seasoning, but on the whole it was fairly decent breakfast. Oddly, both times were were asked if we were paying cash or charging to the room...as if paying by credit card was something they didn't expect. Of course, they took cards, just odd how they phrased the question. We didn't do the pool, but it certainly looked somewhat more inviting than others we'd seen on the strip. At least there was shade and greenery around the pools so we of the light skin could be outside and not in the sun. Conveniently located next to the hotel is a CVS. This one store was a budget saver for us on the trip since I don't think Vegas has learned what a drinking fountain is and the casino shop water was a bit pricey. The only complaint we have is not about the hotel specifically, but the guests who were near us. As is typical, doors into the rooms tend to be grouped side by side and across the hall from one another. Unfortunately the doors and the frames slam shut very loudly, especially between the hours of 2 and 5 am. They are also very loud when room service shows up at 3:45 and knocks on the door across the hallway. All told, for $200/night, the Monte Carlo is a big waste of money. For $100 and if you get quiet, considerate neighbors, it wouldn't be so bad.

It was our first time in Vegas but we'll definitely go back - probably not to the MC though. Check in was fine but I got the impression that the person wanted a tip. I've never tipped for check in before so I didn't start. Maybe I should have because the room we were given wasn't the best. The view was of the pool area - that was fine with us as we're not that picky about the view. Our complaints consisted of the drain in the tub/shower not draining well (I was standing in about 6 inches of water by the end of my shower!) and the room not being cleaned well. I called the front desk to complain about both. There was a tennis ball on the floor from a previous guest so I know they don't pay attention to detail. The person I spoke with put me on hold then offered me 2 free buffets when she got back on the line. She said that both problems would be taken care of and she did apologize. I thought all would be fine but when we came back in after being out for the day the tennis ball was still on the floor - even though the room had been \"cleaned.\" Seeing that I decided to check on how well the tub drained. It was still extremely slow. I ran the water for about a minute and it took several minutes for it to drain. I called back down and I could tell they were a little more frustrated this time with me. They called maintenance and were told that they had fixed the problem. I told them that it hadn't been fixed to our satisfaction so they offered to \"upgrade\" our room. We had to pack up everything and move ourselves to a different floor. The only \"upgrade\" I could see was that we were on a higher floor with a view of the strip (not a great one!) The room actually appeared to be smaller and I didn't like the layout as well. However, we kept it because the drain worked and it appeared to be cleaner than the first one. We did hear the plumbing noise that others have mentioned but we didn't have any hall noise in either room. We couldn't hear our neighbors either. We were in a non-smoking room and didn't smell any smoke on our floor. We did use the free buffets and I will say the food was good. There was a lot of variety and our waiter was very attentive. As far as the casino goes, it was always less crowded than the others we visited. We never won at the MC and were never offered a drink while playing. Actually, the only casinos we were offered a drink at were NYNY and Caesars. Other than the MC buffet we chose to stay away from the rest of them. We ate at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville one night - decent food and enjoyed the band. We ate at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill for lunch - tons of food! And, the wings were tasty. Also, they give out free liquor at the bar whenever his song \"I Love this Bar\" plays. Another fantastic meal was at Mesa Grill. We ate there for lunch because the we knew the dinner menu would be too pricey for us. The food was delicious but you have to like southwest style and be open to things other than burgers and fries (they do offer an \"upscale\" version of that though.) Our lunch ran around $70 for 2 of the peach margaritas, an appetizer and two entrees.

While I don't have much grounds for comparison within other hotels and rooms in Vegas, we did walk around other hotels, and I've done quite a bit of travelling for someonen my age. I would say that Caesars and Bellagio were nicer, this was probably equivalent if not a little bit less nice than NYNY, but it was nicer than Rio and Palms (and it's in a great location!). Rooms were nice... we had a \"strip view\" (the first night was room 21313, and the next five were 22305). This meant we could partially see the strip, but we had a very large view of a gravel unfinished area... We had two queen beds which were nice and clean.. nice bathroom.. only thing that sucked was not having a balcony (but I hear that none of the Vegas hotels do!). Room service food was GREAT. I'm a vegan so I had the garden burger with fries, and a pasta with veges and tomato sauce.. both were incredible. The fries are out of this world. My Mom had the chicken quesadillas and she said they were good. The casino was nice... typical of a Vegas hotel. The first day my Mom won (of course she didn't come out on top by the end of the week lol) so she liked the casino. There's a tram that takes you from MC to Bellagio, but most of the time we were there it wasn't running... that sucked. As for the pool... it is very nice, but there is not a lot of POOL itself. It is broken up into different areas (with a small ave pool as well) with lots of trees area. Obviously what that means is that there is mainly shade everywhere. The only section where you can get sun all day long is facing the tennis courts (not near the pool), and this only starts at around 11am. Overall, I had a great trip.

We stayed at three different hotels: New York New York, MGM Grand, and the Monte Carlo. However, the Monte Carlo was in many ways my favorite. All amenities were in close proximity to one another (I hated walking through that overly expansive MGM Grand Lobby). The pool was a great place to relax, with a number of different types of pools to choose from such as a lazy river and wave pool. Good restaurants to choose from, including a food court for more casual dining, and pretty good shopping, plus there's a free tram that takes you directly to the Bellagio. It's location is perfect for those who like to walk the strip. The video game arcade is a bit dated, though. Rooms look standard, like ones you'd find at other Vegas hotels.

One bath bar would have lasted our three nights no problem. As for the plumbing noises - we did hear it occasionally but did not find it bothersome. Also our room area, at the end of the hall on the 29th floor, was very quiet and we never once heard any guests talking or coughing in rooms around us. As for the pool area. We went down about 9:15am on our first morning and a helpful attendant got us two chairs in a semi-shaded area of our choosing. It was away from the pool area, which was just a short walk to get to. However, as the previous reviewer said, forget about getting one of the \"comfy\" loungers. Not a big deal for us but worth noting - I would say make them all the same to satisfy all guests!

I do not know if it is always this way or only because it was a holiday weekend but we did not enjoy it as much at that time of day.

We chose this particular hotel because of the reasonable rates, location on the strip, and the fact that you didn't need to walk through the casinos in order to take the elevators to your room (we traveled with 2 teens). Another selling feature were the \"incredible 5 pools\" which were raved about from the operator who took our inital reservation. The pool area turned out to be a major disappointment. The \"wave pool\" which my boys were most looking forward to was \"broken\" so the water had to be completely drained. There was no sign of fixing it in sight. This resulted in an already crowded \"lazy River\" to be packed like sardines. The \"main pool\" was on the small side as well and was situated in such a spot that the hotel shielded it from sun until late in the day. This was fine for the folks who enjoy shade, but for those who like the sun, it was a major disappointment. The only water area in a sunny location was the \"baby pool\". Prime lounges next to the pool also had to be \"reserved\" by tossing a towel on them by forming a line at 7:45 in the morning. I do give the Monte Carlo managment credit for upgrading our room to a suite for the unexpected inconvenience (after much complaining), but I still would have opted for functioning pools over the larger accomodations. The rooms themselves were clean and housekeeping prompt with any requests. The food court was convenient but not nearly as varied as the surrounding hotels. Breakfast at McDs everyday got tiresome and the bagel place was horrible. The Brew Pub however was a really nice spot for lunch which the kids enjoyed. We ate at the Market place one evening for Italian which was average. The Lance Burton magic show was cheesy but the boys really liked it and got to be assistants to the magician. I'm not a gambler so I really had no opinion as far as their casino went. It did seem alot less stuffy, less crowded and more sedate than the others which could be either a good or bad thing depending on your personal preferences. One last thing.....make sure you search the room completely before checking out because retrieving a left behind item is next to impossible. I left a favorite pair of sandals in the room which I believe were obscured under the beds dust ruffle. I called the \"lost & Found\" dept several times and never got an actual person-just a recording. I left a detailed message but no word back. Pretty sad how an employee could possibly want someone elses used sandals.

Its not the best place Ive stayed at in Las Vegas, but it was ok for the money. The rooms are pretty nice, and the beds are really comfortable. Had a nice view of the Bellagio and the strip. The thin walls can be a problem. Athough we didnt hear too much of anyone else, its hard to feel romantic if youre worrying about people being able to hear everything going on in your room! Also even though we lucked out with quiet neighbors, I can see where it could be a big issue...one night I was up for an hour listening to a lady cough so loud it sounded like she was in bed with us!! I guess it depends on your location in the hotel because it seems like people either hear everything, or nothing. The breakfast buffet is just ok, but if you get one of those little packets of coupons with the two-for-one deal its worth it. The Brew Pub is awesome. Ate there twice and drank more beer than I can remember. The beers are brewed on site, and are super cheap compared to most places in Vegas. I really recommend the IPA and make sure you get a Giraffe! The tram to the Bellagio is one of the best features of the hotel. Its a godsend not to have to walk that huge space between the two hotels if you're trying to get down the other end of the strip. The pool situation is really as annoying as everyone says. You have to stand in line at 7:45 to get a chair anywhere near the three pools. And once you're out there its pretty irritating to watch one person lay 5 or 6 towels across a bunch of good chairs and then not come back out to the pool till 11. The hotel has a sign about considering a chair vacant after an hour, but thats not enforced as far as I could tell. The major complaint I have about the casino, and this might be a bonus for some people, is its not very crowded or fun. Its pretty and clean, but so vacant and quiet it doesnt have much atmosphere or a good vibe. I like the scene better at the Bellagio or the NY NY. Overall the Monte Carlo is just ok.

Want to preface this by saying my wife and I got a good deal through Travelocity for airfare & six nights ($1,500 total) to stay at the Monte Carlo. So, wasn't expecting a Four Seasons-type experience, but we generally liked the hotel and its location. There were some things you should know before jumping in, however. Just wanted to give everyone a clear picture of what to expect. So here we go... -- Check-in/check-out, bell desk, valet, etc. were EXCELLENT. Service in general at the hotel was top-notch. These folks do work on tips, so have plenty of $1's available. Word to the wise on checking-in. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and got early check-in, but \"rooms with a view\" were not available until 3pm-5pm. Let them know early the day of if you want to wait for a room with a view, and stick around the casino until it becomes available. The bell desk will gladly hold your bags. -- Walls are PAPER THIN between rooms, so pray you don't have a loud couple of a family with kids (like we did) nextdoor while you're there. Plumbing is also loud. But, if you have earplugs from the plane ride there, throw 'em in your ears and it won't bother you. We figured that out the second night and it served us well from there on. -- Ate at the Brew Pub & the Buffet \"Sunday Champagne Brunch\". Was impressed with the Brew Pub (great food, ok prices, good beer and good atmosphere). The \"Sunday Champagne Brunch\" isn't even worth the $17 we paid per person. Selection is uninspiring, Omelettes stop after 11am, and when we asked the waitress for mimosa, she brought out a glass of champagne and a glass of O.J. and told us to mix it ourselves!!! -- Pool was busy, and we could only find a seat far away on the concrete. With 100+ degree temps, this was not comfortable. Guessing this is always the case, since we were in Vegas during \"down season\". Lazy river was overhyped. -- Casino isn't the best or most happening on the strip, and I found most of the dealers (minus the craps table) kind of snotty. If you get a snotty dealer, life's too short--find a different table. Craps lessons available at 11am except on Tues/Wed, take advantage of these. Another note on the casino--MGM Mirage recently (April) bought out the Monte Carlo and several other properties on the strip. However, the Players Club card from MGM Mirage hasn't carried over to these properties yet. Monte Carlo currently works on the One Club card. So, Im guessing these points will not transfer over when the switch happens? Airlines stick it to customers, why not casinos? If you want to START accumulating points for MGM Mirage, recommend you sign up for the card at the MGM Grand across the street of NYNY nextdoor. $25 minimum for any table games to count on your card, though...for some, that will be a bit steep. -- Location on the South Strip was great. Tram from Monte Carlo takes you to the Bellagio (center strip). From there, it's just a short walk to Aladdin, Paris, Caesars, Flamingo, Mirage, Venetian, etc. Monte Carlo is also just a short walk to MGM Grand and NYNY (nextdoor--the Times Sq Bar is a must-do) and Excalibur. From Excalibur, tram takes you to Mandalay Bay and Luxor. We casino-hopped our second day there, and found the location very central. You'll be walking a lot either way, so make sure to wear comfy shoes. Overall, it's a nice place to stay. However, wife & I will probably stay somewhere else next time we go just to change it up.

We went to pool in morning just so we could get chairs for four people....I'm tellin ya, if you plan to spend time at pool in morning, take your room key and get to pool entrance no later then 7:45 a.m.", "Date": "August 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Richmond, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel...Perfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3739599", "Content": "We just got back from our honeymoon in Vegas and stayed at the Monte Carlo July 31-Agusut 4, 2005. We were very happy with our stay at the Monte Carlo. The location of the hotel is excellent. We had very easy access North to the Bellagio via a free tram. Just cross the street and we could go to the Aladdin and Paris. Head south and there was New York New York, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and across the street the MGM grand and Tropicana. All are within easy walking distance or use of a tram (free). We spent most of our time at these locations. We did walk to Caesars, Mirage and the Venetian but only spent a little time there. Our favorites were right across the street or next door. The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is clean and open. Very easy access to everything in the hotel without having to walk through the casino much (expect to get to the buffet and a few restaurants). The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was a standard room but very nice. The bed is the BEST! It has a wonderful pillow top mattress and great pillows. We didn't go to Vegas to sleep, but when you do, you will enjoy it! The plumbing issue that all the other reviewers discuss is definitely there. I heard it mostly around 6 in the morning and was always able to fall right back asleep. Other noises occurred a few times, like a baby crying at midnight and a drunk couple fighting in the hall but I was always able to fall right back asleep because of the awesome bed! My husband slept though it all! We were a little disappointed by the pool. We had planned our honeymoon for Mexico but had to change plans at the last minute because of the hurricane. The pools in Vegas are nothing like Mexico so it's really not a big deal. We knew it wouldn't be the same and we know we probably wouldn't spend much time at the pool. However, that being said, we did want to spend a little time there and enjoy. The pool area is GREAT for families with kids and teens. Not so good for couples who just want to lay out for an hour or two. I went out one morning at 8:00 (when the pool opens), had to stand in a 10 minute line to get a towel (not a big deal), then found a chair way out in the sun and not by any of the pools. It was fine for a while but then I got way too hot and there is nothing every available in the shade. Unless you get up early, wait in line before it's even open. If you are looking for a hotel where you will swim all day this might not be the place for you, unless you are getting up early and staying there to \"guard\" your chairs. The pools are okay. Like I said, great for kids. There is a small wave pool and lazy river. The more adult pool is nice by also small. Overall, I really enjoyed our stay at the Monte Carlo. It's not crowded or busy and the location was key for us. We ate at the brewpub one evening and it was very good. Also shopped in a few of the shops located on the way to the tram, however, shopping is much better in Paris, Bellagio or Desert Passages in Aladdin. Since we were connected to the Bellagio via a short tram ride, I felt that we got to know that hotel as well. We ate, shopped and watched the fountain show with ease. Other sites we saw/went too: Star Trek Experience, Top of Eiffel Tower, Variety show \"V\" in the Aladdin, Buffet at the Aladdin, Todai restaurant (seafood and sushi buffet) in Desert Passages, shopping at the Fashion Show Mall, and played casinos at all hotels listed above. Please e-mail me with any questions! Would we stay at the Monte Carlos again.....? It's tough to say, for the price and location it was perfect but it would be fun to try something new.

You could hear some stuff when you laid down to go to sleep, but if you were in the room talking or watching TV, it wasn't even noticeable. The tram to Bellagio is an awesome bonus feature. We ate one noght at the microbrewery, the food was decent, but the beer was not the best. Pool was very nice, especially the lazy river. My wife and sister said the wave pool was very crowded with kids. The casino is smaller thean most but very easy to get around in. The layout is pretty straight with table games in the middle and machies around the perimeter. Most of the dealers were pretty friendly and the craps lesson was pretty cool. I didn't go to the lesson, but afterward they made the craps table $2 for an hour.

I was a little nervous once I read some of the reviews, and I have to say, I don't know what so may people were complaining about. Sure you could hear the neighbor's shower but it was not that big a deal and sure I could hear the neighbors talking but it certainly did not keep me awake at night. The room was not especially fancy but who spends a lot of time in the room in Vegas anyway? Because the Monte Carlo doesn't have as many gimmicks like so many of the other strip properties it's not as crowded which was really nice. We never waited more than 15 minutes to get in the buffet and the steakhouse was really pleasant, romantic experience. The location is central to lots of hotels on the strip. I really enjoyed the pool with the wave pool and lazy river. There were plenty of spots with shade and when it got pretty hot the wave pool and lazy river were perfect. The inner tubes were a little pricey at $12 per day but you could buy them at nearby CVS or Walgreens for half the price. Careful of the Mai-Tais served in a football- they were mixed pretty strong. Tasty though. We booked online and got some kind of summer escape special which came with coupons for but one get one free at the buffet, raft rentals spa admission, and discounts at some of the shops. It saved us a lot of money and the reservation agent disocunted the room a little more than was advertised. The staff was pretty friendly, check in and out was smooth, housekeeping never interfered when the \"Privacy\" sign was out which is REALLY important for a getaway with your significant other. I've heard horror stories of overzealous housekeeping staff interrupting intimate activity. That is where the thin walls were a bit of a problem-we could tell the neighbors in the next room were listening. The food prices were a bit steep, except the buffet. All in all, I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again. My biggest complaint is that we requested a non-smoking room and even though we were on a \"non-smoking\" floor, I smelled my neighbor's cigarrette smoke the ENTIRE time. And there is an ashtray directly beneath the sign outside the elevator that says \"NON-SMOKING FLOOR.\" I should have complained but I didn't. Also no safes in the room, that's a bit odd. I've stayed in much less quality hotels and more quality rooms worldwide and have always had a safe of some sort.

We had picked the Monte Carlo based on price (less than a lot of the other strip hotels) and location (it was our first time in Vegas and we wanted to stay on the strip). My thoughts: Location: Perfect. Central to everything. Walked from Mandalay Bay to the Wynn. MGM, NYNY, Paris, Bellagio, Venetian are all very close. Accommodation: We had spent the three previous nights at the JW Marriott, so just about any room was going to feel small. The rooms are basic, but comfortable and clean. No great frills, but no bad surprises either. Service: Very good. We checked in early (about 1 p.m.) and were given a room with a Mountain View. Our attempts to nap (mid-afternoon) were thwarted by very noisy neighbours so we asked for another (preferably strip-view) room. The front desk sent someone up to meet us with a key for a 16th floor strip-view room. Check out was also very convenient. Amenities: The pool is a zoo. While the wave pool and lazy river are nice in theory, neither is all that exciting (air mattresses cost extra). The day we lay out by the pool, there were a million people around. The redeeming feature was the big Rum Runner (served in a plastic football-shaped vessel). Didn't eat at any of the MC restaurants (save for breakfast at McDonalds and at the bagel place - where they have awesome bagel sandwiches - highly recommended). Otherwise, ate at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Venetian, the Chinese place in MGM, and RumJungle at Mandalay Bay (all three of which I would recommend highly). Casino: Casino is ok. I preferred the casinos at the MGM, NYNY, and Luxor. The casino felt a bit clasutrophobic to me. DO order the beers from the MC brewery though - one advantage this casino has over all others on the strip.

I have to say this, late at night to three am or so, we heard It all, including the profanity used during It. It was so loud that it woke both my husband and myself out of a sound sleep. This was bad enough every night but would be a real concern if we had small children in the room. The hotel room itself was small and the wardrobe was off its hinge on one side making it impossible to hang our clothes up.The bathroom needing caulking around the tub, and some days we received soap, shampoo, lotions etc. But only one day of the five did we get the mineral bath, or the mouth rinse. But having said all that, the hotel staff were great, very pleasant and efficient. The layout at the hotel makes it easy to enter and exit without feeling you have walked miles to do so.

It was on the 25th floor with a good view of Bellagio and part of strip--the room seemed small--no coffeemaker in room just a tv two chairs and bed. There was no safe in the room either which I found surprising. The decor seemed nice though, I thought it would be fine for two nights. If it was any longer I would want a larger room with more amenities in my room. I have four complaints about the hotel and room though--the pillows are tiny and very cheap quality and lumpy. We only got three very small pillows so I asked for a few more hoping they would be in better shape but no luck they were in same condition. Also, the towels in bathroom were extremely worn out, very thin and rough like very old towels. I would say the towels by the pool were in much better shape! I noticed when we arrived there was no bellman available that I could see, it would have been nice to have ice brought into our room and told about amenities about the hotel, etc. The ice machine on our floor (only ONE) was broken one day and working so poorly the next day I had to go down one floor to get ice! After looking in a couple of other fancy hotels in the strip, I would probably book a different hotel if it is only a bit more to pay. This hotel is probably good for people with kids, because of the wave pool and lazy river style pool. There were definitely kids everywhere also because of the long weekend holiday. The really good restaurant I liked in the hotel was the Market Caffe--the thin crust pizzas are excellent, as are the salads! The portions are very good value for the price.

First, the staff did a great job of making sure we had the adjoining rooms we requested (eventhough we weren't there early for check-in). The rooms are large and they were very clean. The bathrooms were a good size. We did notice that the plumbing did make a fairly loud sound whenever our toilet was flushed. My sister and her family had a room on our floor (12th) and said they could hear water running in the pipes all night their first night there. They changed rooms the next day and didn't experience the problem any longer. Our kids enjoyed the wave pool and the lazy river. They also enjoyed playing video games in the room, which was made possible by a very helpful engineer at the hotel \"fixing\" our TV to make the hookup possible. We called on the staff for things like that (getting extra towels, for example) and were helped pretty much immediately in each instance. The ambiance of the hotel isn't what you find in some of the others on the strip, but the prices are cheaper for the rooms, so perhaps you are getting what you pay for. It was awesome to have a CVS and Walgreens within an easy 5-minute walk. The ESPN zone was right next door, too, and if you have children you have to give it a try. The duckpin bowling was a huge hit with our family. We then walked about 20 yards and ate at a New York style Pizzeria inside New York-New York (which is where the entrance to the ESPN zone is located). A whole pie was only $15, which is quite a bargain in today's Las Vegas. The food isn't cheap like it was 20 years ago when the wife and I were there. I've seen some talk about the $5 tables at the Monte Carlo. To be honest, we didn't see many of those. Sometimes in the early afternoon, it seemed as though a few tables would be set for $5, but by 5 p.m., the minimum was typically $10. But that seemed to be pretty typical for that end of the strip (and perhaps the strip as a whole.) We went to New York, New York, Excalibur and a few others one evening and found only a couple of $5 blackjack tables (all of which were packed). The real nice thing about the Monte Carlo casino was it didn't smell smoky at all. Those who are saying that it's centrally located, however, must have a different version of cental than I do. In my opinion it is almost located at the very end of one portion of the strip. We walked for at least an hour (and probably more) to get to Treasure Island so our kids could see the pirates battle (DO NOT DO THIS if you want to see pirates battle!!!!), and Treasure Island still wasn't even halfway down the strip. If you are looking for centrally located then the Venetian, Flamingo, Wynn or Treasure Island would probably be closer. One thing to know (that I wish we had known earlier) is you can drive your car to virtually any casino and park in the free guest parking. We were under the impression that it applied only to the parking garage at the Monte Carlo (since that was where we were staying) until the last day of our trip. Give the wax museum a try. The interactive stuff is a lot of fun. My daughter \"married\" George Clooney; my wife got next to Hugh Hefner in his Playboy bed; my sons scored on a layup against Shaq (and the crowd roared) and the gallery voiced its approval when I sank a putt with Tiger and Arnold Palmer watching.

When you first arrive from the airport, your shuttle, limo,or taxi will drop you off at the back entrance of the hotel. As soon as you walk in, you will see a long counter of stations for check in and check out. We were greeted courteously, the service was fairly expedient and we were not rushed during either check in or check out. As you walk past the counter, you will see elevators for each part of the towers of the hotel. Our room was 26313 with a perfect view of the strip and the mountains in the background. Rooms are large with either interactive Internet on the TV, or a special connection for those with laptops. The fee for interactive Internet service (viewed through the television screen with a special keyboard provided by the hotel) is $5.99 for about 2 hours. Using this equipment makes it easy to surf the net, learn more about the shows, and correspond using E-mail all in the comfort of your room. The room is temperature controlled. We kept our thermostat at a comfortable 76 degrees and it was great--it also offers the centigrade conversion factor, so you will never be too hot or too cold in the rooms. Speaking of room, I was told by a seasoned Las Vagas girlfriend that the Monte Carlo offers the most comfortable beds on the strip. We all agreed. As far as noises, not one of us heard them. Yes, the commode will flush with a rather startling sound of rushing water, but only for less than 5 seconds. On the ground floor, the casino area is about 1/2 mile long and there are some nice places to eat along the right side. We found the Cafe the most reasonable with a versitle menu. The night life is just beyond that and there is live entertainment and dancing. This hotel is not as confusing as the others we visited during our stay, but every night we were glad to soak up the comfort of our rooms and get a good night's sleep. The bathroom is spacious with a tub/shower combination and elongated counter space around the sink. Let's leave the room and visit the pools. The decor is tropical with fountain features and a tunnel leading to one of the areas. The lazy river is relaxing. You will see tubes of all colors and sizes as you float along. Cost for renting a raft from the hotel is $12.50/day (24 hours) There is a delightful wave pool just to the left of the lazy river and further left is a free-form heated pool less crowded and better for adult swims. If hot tubs are your thing, try the one within the complex of the pool area. It's hot and bubbly for easing muscle pain from all the activities on the strip. All in all, the Monte Carlo offers exceptional guest relations service, a wide variety of dining choices ranging from McDonalds to the more elete, and a little Hudson News store for daily papers, munchies, water, and several souvenier items. Drink lots of water in Las Vegas! The temperatures soar into the hundreds and rose all the way to 112 on Saturday, July 2. This hotel is located on the strip and after taking a stroll through the casino area, you will be on South Las Vegas Boulevard. The managable walk through the casino is long, but not nearly as spacious as the Bellagio, or MGM, or Paris. If you turn left you will see a CVS Pharmacy on the corner, if you turn right you can walk to New York. Crossing the streets in Vegas is tricky. There are only a few spots that permit crossing. Look for the light once you enter the Las Vegas Strip. Those lights are the only permitted spots to cross. After a long day on the strip, you might want to consider the spa offered at the Monte Carlo. Everything you need to have a wonderful time is available through this lovely hotel. A tram to the Bellagio is worth taking from the Monte Carlo--just for the experience of seeing the lovely water show. The sound of rushing water dancing in the pool at the Bellagio captivates the immagination and is magnificant to see, the best part, it's only a 3 minute tram away from the Monte Carlo. Easy access to everything in the hotel, good food, great service and 3 lovely pools makes this a 4 on my review. Now that they have been bought by MGM. the hotel has even better things on their horizon.

I've stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and actually liked the hotel previously, but my last stay pretty much has convinced me that I will not stay there again. Particular problems: 1) I had made my reservation > 1 month in advance, and had requested a room with a king size bed. I realize that the requests will \"attempt to be honored, but are not guaranteed\". However, I arrived at the hotel around 9PM and all such rooms were gone. In order to get what I wanted, I was effectively forced to upgrade the room at the cost of $35, $50 and $50 dollars for the 3 nights of my stay. Of course, I suppose this is to be expected, but it has not happened to me before at any other hotel (and I've stayed in a lot of them!). Further, at the final price per night, I likely could have stayed at another more expensive hotel to begin with (and the room was fairly pricey to begin with, given the trip was on a weekend). 2) Given the upgrade mentioned above, we ended up on the 32nd floor which is where the suites are located (and you need to use your room card in the elevator to even get to this floor). So, I expected a pretty nice room with good amenities. The room was good (the bed was great), but the toilet did not flush all that well. Further, the shower head was particularily bad. It was designed for someone about 5'6\" (I am 5'10\" and had to crouch in order to get my head underneath...). It was not \"detachable/handheld\" which is something I like, although other rooms in the hotel do have \"detachable/handheld\" shower heads (I know, because I had previously been in such a room). 3) I got charged room service (only $8. but still...) for water that apparently got drank. However, there was no water left in the room by room service the first two nights of the stay (i.e., there was no water in the room when I arrived, and there was none left the second night). For the third night, there was water, but I did not use it as I had walked across the strip to CVS and bought my own water. Fine, I had to pay for an upgrade, but the room was nicer than the normal ones. However, being charged for something I did not use is pretty unacceptable. 4) Upon checkout, I would not say that the person helping me was very friendly at all. (The person helping to check me in was, however, helpful). I really got the impression that since my stay was over, they no longer cared. Bad for repeat business... As I mentioned at the beginning, I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before. I liked the hotel, and that is why I chose to stay there this time (I consider it to be a pretty good hotel in a good location). However, I was not impressed at all with this last visit. For what the stay ended up costing, I am sure I could have stayed in another hotel (e.g., I've stayed at Paris which has much nicer rooms and is in a really good location too - I had checked prices at Paris before booking my trip and a standard room was about $20. more per night that the Monte Carlo. However, given I paided > $35. more/night for the upgrade at the Monte Carlo... I would also comment that the standard room at Paris was as nice as the upgraded Monte Carlo room and has a much nicer bathroom compared to the Monte Carlo upgrade with a great shower). Given the number of very good hotels in Las Vegas located on the strip, I really don't think I will ever stay at the Monte Carlo again. I'd recommend that if there is another hotel within a few dollars of your budget such as Paris, Treasure Island, etc. that I would pick one of them first any day.", "Date": "June 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect spot for convenience (esp. w/children)\u201d", "Author": "hogandi", "ReviewID": "UR3609744", "Content": "We loved our stay at the Monte Carlo. -But our reasons why may be different from most: we loved it's simplicity and convenience.

All in all, it was an enjoyable experience, but I did have some qualms. First, the positives: check in was both fast and pleasant. The woman who checked us in (a few hours early) found rooms on the same floor as friends we were traveling with. No kings were available, so rather than wait, we took two queens, which was fine. As with most staff in Vegas, very professional and friendly. The casino is superb. As others have commented, it\u2019s not smoky at all; indeed, it has a pleasant smell. Friendly dealers, great blackjack rules, especially for a strip casino. We were able to find a $5 table with no problem during the middle of the week. Though I am not a roulette player, my friends insist the action there is good, though they were a little disappointed that the only single-zero table was in the high-roller section. The pool was of course a little crowded, with a few too many badly behaved children, but it was nice. Lots of shade from the trees (not a bad thing in Vegas), and different pools to from which to chose. Again, great service. My main complaint with the Carlo was the room itself. The exteriors of the hotel are nice: elevators, hallways, etc. But the room was a bit of a letdown. The rooms look older than they are. And as others have mentioned, it is noisy. I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor before arriving and thought that since I live in a townhouse with noisy neighbors, I would be fine. Well, the voices from other rooms aren't terrible (mainly loud people in hall in my experience), but the plumbing was very loud. If someone showers in the middle of the night, you will hear it. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would have hoped for; and after showering, there was 5 inches of water in the tub. My friends' room smelled of smoke, though ours did not. They also had problems with the slow drain. True, I did not complain about this, as we were only there two days, but given the complaints about this (from reading reviews alone), it's hard to imagine they are unaware of these problems. As a point of comparison, we stayed at the Stratosphere during the second part of the trip (to save money during the weekend), and were extremely happy with their rooms, which had none of these problems mentioned above. Of course, location matters too, and the Carlo has them beat hands down. All in all, I was not upset about the rooms, and we paid around $89/night, which is great for its location.

We were dropped off by the airport shuttle bus ($5 each) at the reception entrance at the rear of the hotel. The reception area is spacious and very grand and unlike several other strip hotels, you do not have to travel through the casino to reach it. We arrived around 5pm, there was no waiting at all and we were greeted by a friendly member of staff. When I asked about a strip view room we were offered one with 2 queen size beds. We had already decided that we wanted the luxury of the king size bed so went with the pool and mountain view which was fine. The elevators are close to reception and are arranged in three groups of six for every 10 floors making a total of 18, hence again no waiting. Our room on the 20th floor was a good size with nice furniture, good size bathroom and a bed to die for, it was sooo comfortable! We left a tip of $2-3 per day and our room was kept spotless by the housemaid with a plentiful supply of toiletries. In terms of the dreaded noise issue mentioned in other reviews; yes the plumbing from adjacent rooms can be heard at times and if you had a noisy neighbour I imagine the noise could transmit through the connecting door. However we didn\u2019t experience any problems at all. We ate at the MC micro brewery first night where the food was good at reasonable prices although we did have to wait 30 minutes for a table only to find the pub was only half full! (our only real complaint). Another night we ate Italian at the Market city caf\u00e9 where the food was very good with excellent service. We used the food court on occasions when we were pushed for time and it was fine. We also ate one morning at the buffet breakfast, which was more than adequate for the price of $10.95 (+ tax and tip). However if you want a real treat try Bellagio or Paris. The choice of buffet breakfast at both of these hotels is tremendous for around $13-$15 per person, Paris having the edge. The MC pool area has a good mix of sun and shade in the afternoon (more shade in the morning). The wave pool is good fun as is the lazy river. You can hire the rubber rings for the lazy river for $12 or buy your own for $6 at the CVS store next door. Towels are obviously provided free to residents at the poolside. The \u201cbed hoggers\u201d are kept in check by the pool attendants who return the sunbeds to the pile if they have not been used for an hour. A few other general points, the hotel is in a very good location on the strip in terms of visiting other hotels. However if you want to avoid the heat and hustle and bustle of the strip (it does get very busy in the evening) then take the automated tram to Bellagio which then connects through to Ceasars Palace. The tram is located behind the microbrewery and runs every few minutes. The casino is however easy to navigate through and it only takes about 5 minutes to walk from the strip to the elevator and upto your room. The hotel also has a Dollar car rental office where we picked up our convertible for an unforgettable trip around California \u2013 but that\u2019s another story. Overall we were very pleased with the Monte Carlo and would highly recommend it. Whilst not in the same bracket as the Bellagio etc it remains a classy hotel and for the price we paid of $69/79 a night it is excellent value for money.

There is a tram that goes between MC and Bellagio and once at Bellagio's we could \"hit the strip\", which was a lot of fun. We did dine at other casinos, but decided that the Monte Carlo buffet was the best - breakfast and dinner! Not even Bellagio's could compare, all thought we do like Bellagio's casino and atmosphere, the Monte Carlo casino is as just as good (especially late at night). The room service is excellent, the girls are very pleasant and polite and keep the rooms nice and clean. The std rooms are nice size and the beds are comfortable. We never had a taxi problem, no lines like at some other hotels and we were there over the Memorial Day weekend. Easy access to and from the airport, no more than 10-15 minutes. We are planning on going again in September and we will be staying there again. Oh! I forgot to mention the pool area which has this tropical setting, lots of privacy for adults, water falls, lazy river for the kids, but if you are not into kids you can find a spot that's quieter and more private too. Monte Carlo doesn't have that many kids anyway, so no worry. The people at MC are very friendly. One more thing, no matter which tower your room is in you will have a beautiful view from your hotel room. Last time we were facing the Rio and we could see the whole city lights at night, which was beautiful. This time we had a view of the Bellagio's, the Paris, the Eiffel tower, and more - it was magnificent, especially at night. If you are looking for absolute luxury and big rooms then MC isn't for you. We liked it and we are going back, after all how much time do you spend in the room? With all the stuff to see and do in Vegas you'd be lucky to get 5 hours of sleep...

I went to Caesar's casino one night and got lost. This is not a mega structure as some of the others and not as crowded. The room was plain , nothing fancy. Housekeeping had the beds made every day by 2pm. I had a good view of New York New York, Luxor and Excalibur with some mountains thrown in. This is not my first visit to Vegas. I stayed at the Bellagio the last time. The Bellagio is in a class by itself with the price of a room to match. There is a tram that will take you from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio and reverse. So if you have this incredible desire to see the Bellagio and all its opulence, you don't have to walk in the brutal sun (90's). Simpy put, the Monte Carlo is simple,cheap, and just a great place to gamble (if that's what you like) and eat. I'll say it again, the buffet is EXCELLENT and not that expensive. Breakfast about $11.29 and dinner about $17.25 with tax. I would definitely go back there again. I have read others mention about the noise. It is really not that bad.

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a wonderfully fresh scent, not stale casino. Check in was a breeze, there was plenty of staff waiting to greet you. The halls with shops and pub were a nice surprise as well. The pub had terrific beer (made on site) where you could grab a reasonably priced bite of food. Or you can visit their food court which houses some fast food like McD's and Sbarro. In the same location as the pub there is a monorail which goes directly to the Bellagio. This is a wonderful feature, especially if grabbing a show like Cirque du Soleil \"O\" which is currently playing at the Bellagio. As an aside, if you have heard wonderful things about the buffet at the Bellagio, as we did, you may be disappointed, as we were. It was alot of $$ for lackluster food. But that is another review! The location of the Monte Carlo is simply perfect. You can monorail as I stated to the Bellagio to the left (which is across the street from the beautiful Paris) or just to the right is New York New York which is where we went for our Starbucks fix and for a wonderful meal at their Italian restaurant. Once past the NY NY, you can grab a monorail at the Excalibur (which is connected by pedestrian bridge) to the Luxor and the Mandalay Bay. Directly across the street from the Monte Carlo is a fun little shopping center with M & M's world (which is where I bought fun souveniers for the kids) and the Coca Cola store. There is also an arcade there and a pretty good sized food court for a cheap bite. There are also a Walgreen's and CVS just outside the front door of the Monte Carlo for bandaids and sunscreen! My only disappointment with the Monte Carlo was in the rooms. The plumbing coming from the rooms next door is quite loud. AND you can hear the conversations of the guests. The shower is also quite low on the wall and if you are taller than 5'6 or so you will have to scrunch yourself down to rinse your hair! In addition, the shower only sprays hard and harder with no inbetween. I know this is being picky but when you are hot and tired and just want a relaxing shower, it won't happen. The pool area was large enough with a fun lazy river to float in and a regular sized pool too. It was 105 when we were there and there was plenty of shade and sun to relax in. Let me just conclude by saying, you don't need to rent a car in Vegas but you must allow yourself plenty of time to walk to the neighboring resorts for shows or reservations. Based on the location of your room it can take a good 5 to 10 minutes to get from home base to the front door of the casino.

The bed was a pillow top and while the top layer was soft the bed provided excellent support, so I was very happy and comfortable. There were some amenities lacking and other issues that keep the Monte Carlo from being a 4-star hotel. First of all, there are no full length mirrors! There is a mirror in the room but you can only see yourself down to the knees. I like to see my shoes with my outfits and actually have never stayed anywhere that didn't have a full length mirror. They do have irons/boards in the room which is handy. The lighting is only so-so.

A girl came to the room and stated that the TVs were new and so big they could not be lifted out of the armoir, and also they did not keep spares. She turned the TV on and the screen was yellow.

I was very upset and in pain so he asked that both myself and husband went to the front desk to speak to him. I refused and my husband went.

He was very rude and stated that all breakages were charged for and that they management had ways and means of finding out these things. He also reiterated the hotel did not have insurance for damages caused by occupants. Something I find very hard to believe.

We would definitely stay there again. Check in was very easy and we upgraded to a \"view room\" with a king bed on the 24th floor for an additional $10 a night. The upgrade was well worth it for the wonderful view. To the right we could see the entire north end of the Strip and to the left we could see the Rio, the Palms, Red Rock Canyon and Mt Charleston. All the lights at night were beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and soft and we didn't have any problem with noise. Housekeeping was excellent. We ate at the buffet breakfast one day. It was good but not as good as the MGM Grand buffet (but MGM cost about $1.50 more a person). If you buy anything at Nathan's in the food court, they will give you a coupon for \"buy one, get one free\" Express Breakfast. We did that twice and it was an excellent deal. For 8 bucks, we got 2 big breakfasts - choice of waffle, pancakes, cheese omelet or biscuits and gravy, plus bacon or sausage, toast, hash browns and coffee or tea. We spent some time in the casino, playing Black Jack and Craps. There were a couple of $5 tables. You can get a comp card but you have to bet $25 a hand to use it. That's ok for Craps but pretty steep for Black Jack. The card can also be used at Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. All the dealers were friendly except for one. We were playing Craps and the table was really hot. We were up several hundred dollars when the dealer got grumpy at my husband for taking too long to shoot the dice. So we left, which was just as well because if we'd stayed we probably would have ended up giving the money back to the casino. The location of the Monte Carlo is a big plus. It's an easy walk to New York New York, Excalibur and MGM Grand. There is a tram that goes from Excalibur to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay and another tram that goes from the Monte Carlo to Bellagio. You can see a good part of the Strip by taking advantage of the trams. We would recommend renting a car, too. We paid $130 for the whole week (including gas) and were able to get to Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon, Downtown and hotels on and off the Strip. It was much cheaper than renting taxis and paying for tours. All the hotels have free parking, which is really convenient. Just don't drive on the Strip after noon - it gets very crazy.

It has a lot of the features of the big boys, but the price is usually reasonable compared to the swanky big name joints. 2.

The maid service accidently threw it away! I called housekeeping to ask for help, and they sent a manager up within 15 minutes. He promised to help, disappeared for about 45 minutes, found it in the trash, and returned it to me! I can't imagine how much rooting around in the trash it must have taken with a whole hotel floor's worth of garbage.

Check-in was fast, asked what upgrades were available and they offered a couple, $20 for a larger room and $50 for a room with jaccuzi, I declined both as was staying by myself and did not really require anything special. Got a standard room on the 9th floor with a view of the back of NYNY. The room was clean, nicely decoraterd, with alot less wear than you would expect from a hotel that has had 100's of 1000's of people pass through it. For $79 a definet bargian. Yes, there were all the little bottles of shampoo ect. in the bathroom as well as a couple other surprises that all you ladies will enjoy immensly. Yes the toilets are loud when they flush, new technology in the toilet industry, but believe me, after you flush one of these babies, there will be no chance of you seeing any trace of a log jam and the noise lasts for about 3-5 seconds. Beds are very comfortable, I slept like a baby. I read some reviews about noise from adjacent rooms, well, there is a door joining the next room, but unless you have it open with your ear up against it, you won't hear anything and if you do..well, your just a pervert. Maid service was good, I ussually left the room in some sort of dissaray and returned to find it magically returned to a state of clean and tidy...I loved that. I ussually left a $2 tip for the magician who did this work, however one day they left it on the counter exactly where I had placed it..maybe they thought I needed it more than they did. The food services in the hotel were definetly adiquate, if you didn't gain a couple lbs while you were here, you must be anorexic. Do taste the horseradish in the buffet..it will litterally bring tears to your eyes, I was bawling like a baby as I ate my roast beef. There is also a food court, pizza, burgers, baggles, hotdogs, the american staples. The pool area was very nice, they have a lazy river thats not that lazy, it moves quite swiftly, the wave pool is a nice touch, there is a childrens pool which I think parents with small children will enjoy, a larger pool for swimming which early in the day is a bit shaded and a hot tub. If you want to get wet, you can find a place here to do it. There is also an area the size of a small parking lot where you can get the full blown effects of the sun and critique the new styles of bathing / sunning attire of the ladies, anouther nice touch. The location of the hotel on the strip is perfect as anyone who has been to vegas can attest to, walking the strip can be a somewhat painfull experiance after you have done it the 3rd time, nothing worse than a case of vegas feet and if you never had it you will definetly know when you get it. The gambling is like any other casino in vegas, they will get your money..eventually...however some dealers do it with more class than others. I prefer to have mine taken in the classiest of ways. Drinks at the tables were always plentiful, I was never without one for lack of service. There are a few boutiques for shopping, nothing to extravigant (aka ceasers forum shops). One other suggestion....when you are shopping and come to a store with a massaging lounge chair for sale.....DO TAKE THE TEST DRIVE......its the best 15 min massage you will get in vegas for the price.

I had read almost every review on this hotel since I booked my trip, so I knew exactly what I was getting into. I read some good and not so good reviews. And I would have to say that I don't regret my decision to stay at all. I booked through America West Vacations and got a great deal with airfare included. 1. I had a connecting flight from JFK to LA to LV. Both flights were on-time and quick. 2. Check-in at the hotel was quick(1:30pm) and I asked if there were any available Spa Suites and how much. The front desk person was very nice and helpful. She told us nothing was available that night and told us to call the next day and check(we never did). She gave us a room and a key with a semi-view of the strip but told us we had to wait till 3 for our room to be ready. This wasn't a big deal since we were going to get some lunch at their buffet anyway. So we gave our luggage to the bell hop and headed towards the MC buffet. The price was pretty good but I wasn't too impressed with the selection or quality. After lunch we walked the strip for a bit, signed up for the One Club Card and played the slots. So, 4:00pm came around and we figured our room would have been ready by then, we were wrong. We waited till 5:00pm till we decided to head back to the front desk and complain. The front desk associate told us the room was still not ready and decided to get us a different room that was. By this time, we were so upset and so tired, but MC did make up for it by upgrading our room to a full view of the strip on a higher floor. We overlooked the pool and the view was absolutely beautiful. 3. Our room was a good size with a king bed, which was very comfortable. I didn't notice any wear and tear. The bathroom was pretty big as well, loved all the amenities the hotel provided. The toilet was loud but I didn't care. I would rather have a strong flushing toilet than a weak one. I would occasionally hear some noises coming from the other rooms(which were usually just the shower) but it wasn't too excessive. I hear the same noises in my apt. building, you get used to it :o) Side Note: Housekeeping didn't come up to clean our room one day. I think it was because we slept in one morning and had the \"Do not disturb\" sign up. But we figured they would come up sometime throughout the day. That was the only setback. 4. I usually only play the slots, so I can't really say much about the tables or the dealers. I also loved how the casino wasn't overly huge. I really appreciated it after those long walks on the strip(you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators from the Strip). 5. LOVED the Brewpub. My boyfriend(now fiance as of 03/26) really like the Pale Ale and I usually had the Winners Wheat. We visit alot of breweries thoughout the country and we really liked the quality of their beer. We drank at the brewpub a few nights while we were there. 6. We ate at a bunch of buffets, but my fav. was the Paris Buffet(easter dinner) and Luxor(breakfast). 7. Lastly, I do believe this will be the Vegas trip I will remember forever. My boyfriend proposed to me on the gondola ride at the Venetian the Sat. after we arrived!!

If you do go try to get the king bed as it frees up some space in the room. For the people that complain about pipe noise... there is some noise of water once in awhile considering there are other people staying all around you. If water noise is your biggest concern I would suggest not leaving the cushy confines of your home. The pool is pretty nice but mostly in the shade. The lazy river ride was closed at the time. If you can eat at Andre's while you are there you wont be disappointed. It is expensive but has great food and it is an excellent experience. The tram between monte carlo and bellagio was not working when we were there. If it was you would be able to cover all parts of the strip with ease.

I usually return to the MC for the following reasons: 1) Room rates seem to be slightly lower than comparable hotels on the strip, after looking for internet rates, etc.... 2) Location...you cannot beat it, and if you are driving (as I usually do), the access from the parking lot (or the open lot across the street from the lobby) is easy and allows for a pretty quick walk through the lobby and directly to the elevators, WITHOUT having to walk through the casino gaming area.... Also great walking and/or monorail proximity to NY-NY, Bellagio, MGM (and it's movie theater); Excalibur; Mandalay; and Luxor; along with other south strip locales. 3) Not an overwhelming number of young children. 4) The gym/spa is well furnished, but relatively small, and you will pay to use it. The pool is pretty nice. 5) The gaming area is small by strip standards (which I like), and seems to be professionally managed with a courteous but slightly indifferent staff. As far as hot/cold tables...? Hey, win some/lose some.....universal rule, I think. 6) Drink and foods service/restaurants are average, but options are obviously available away from the property if you wish....the food court serves it's purpose, but beware of lines durning mid a.m. hours... 7) Housekeeping has always seemed pretty responsive and thorough... 8) The rooms are neither overly impressive nor terrible...about what you would expect for the usual rate.

Check in was disorganized and our clerk was completely disinterested. She just gave us a room (she did accomodate our request for a high floor--28) quickly. In her defense, the people ahead of us seemed to be giving her major problems. Our room was much smaller than we are used to at other casinos, both in Vegas and Atlantic City and the lack of a safe in the room (which is standard in AC) was distressing. I have stayed in Vegas three previous times at three other hotels and none had a safe. Odd, I think. We, of course, were lucky enough to have the loudest neighbors in the world, but thankfully they checked out after three nights. The walls are VERY thin so you do hear your neighbors shower, talk and whatever. I knew this going in but hoped that we would have quiet neighbors. The room was kept clean and the beds were very comfortable. Enjoyed our view of I-15 and the Palms but at night with all the lights, it was beautiful. We could see the mountains which was very nice. Room service was quick and tasty. Found it amusing that during the week, chaise lounges were already set out at the pool, but come Friday, the chairs were stacked and an attendant had to put them out for you. On the positive side, the location cannot be beat. Can easily walk to all the casinos so if you aren't planning n taking any side trips to Red Rock or Hoover Dam, a car is really unnecessary. Also, I really liked the fact that we didn't have to walk through the casino to get to our room.

They were willing to coach along new gamblers, and even showed me how to play Roulette in the middle of a busy table. The casino was smaller than most, which made it easier to get around and find your friends when you were ready to leave. The pool was heated, I was a bit disapointed that the lazy river was closed for repairs, and the pool is in the shade most of the day. This does have an upside though, no sunburn and it's easy to find a chair.

Pros: Smaller and quieter than the other hotels in the area. If you're not into having kids around, this is a good place to be. I've stayed at the Luxor in the past, and found it to be overrun with children (probably due to the Excalibur being next door). Check-in was fairly quick; our room wasn't ready and we had asked for a king-sized bed. They put us into another room with 2 queens (which we were fine with) and said we could switch the next night if we wished. We did end up switching, but for a different reason -- there was a strong odour of cooking that we found obnoxious. The front desk moved us up a floor (25th) and gave us a king-sized bed and a strip view for no extra charge. It was nice, but I can't imagine paying an additional $20 per night for it. The room was nothing special, but it was clean and in good condition. Considering that I'd probably get the same layout at a Doubletree and pay $100+, I was content. Cons: *IMPORTANT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU CHECK IN* The hotel put a 100 USD per day hold on my credit card for amenities (ie. room service, charging restaurant visits to your room), and didn't inform me they were doing so. On the third day of my visit, I had my card declined while dining out and was bewildered because I knew I had enough cash -- this was due to the Monte Carlo. The front desk eventually cleared it up, and informed me that this was standard procedure at all Vegas hotels. This isn't true. I've never encountered this at Luxor, and when I stayed at the Aladdin, they gave me the option of allowing a per diem for amenities to be taken from my card. The Monte Carlo never gave us the option of declining -- they just charged my card. I was upset because it was going to take 5-7 days for the bank to credit the cash back to my account. The hotel was apologetic, but didn't offer anything to smooth over the situation.

This time we wanted something nicer. There were lots of bargains for the time we were going to be there, but none as nice for the price we got ($49/nite). I had read many reviews, some glowing and others negative. My sister stayed there in October and was pleased so we booked our room (over the internet). First, let me say that everyone we had contact with was wonderful. The valet that parked our car was very considerate to my wife. She had left a bag in the car after it was parked and he went with her to retrieve it. Check in was a little slow, not bad, but the clerk was very helpful in getting us an upper floor (29th) with the view we wanted. The bell hops were \"Johnnie on the spot\" delivering our luggage. As to the room itself, I was very impressed. Nice carpets, attractive furniture, quiet adjustable heat, spacious bathroom and comfortable beds. I think the shower has plenty of power. As to noise, we had no problems at all. Maybe if someone is shouting, you might hear, but otherwise nothing to complain about. The hotel itself was layed out nicely so you can bypass the casino to get to the pool area and some restuarants. I didn't get a chance to use the pool as there was a bad storm and cold weather the days we were there (Jan 2-5). Other staff we met were very helpful as well, the concierge that got us tickets to Mama Mia and the Spa staff my wife met. She was very pleased with the AromaTherapy message she got. We are not big gamblers, just do some slots, so I can't comment on the dealers. One thing I noticed was the air was fresher in the casino than others we went into. One of the big pluses of this hotel is it's location. You have 2 monorail systems to use close by. One goes south to the Mandalay Bay. The other goes north to the Riveria. Of course there is lots to do within walking distance. We didn't eat in any of the nicer restuarants on site as we have our favorites in other locations. The bagel shop and pizza were good. We used express checkout with the TV in the room. Very convienent and saved standing in line. All in all, this was a great stay for one heck of a price.

I stayed at Monte Carlo for New Years and I must say the hotel was awesome. The staff was VERY friendly except for one BJ dealer who must not have gotten her new attitude for Christmas. The location is perfect being right next to NYNY and across from MGM which might explain why the hotel was never crowded. The check in was a breeze but I also arrived there at 12:30a and check out was also a breeze. Beware of the cost of long distance phone calls. YIKES!! Use a cell phone if you have one. The hotel room was nothing that took my breath away. Kind of like a room at the Holiday Inn. The bed was very comfy and the shower bowed out giving plenty of room. They did provide shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, oatmeal soap, another bar of soap and a shower cap with lots of towels! I was disappointed that the room did not have a safe but did have a hair dryer, iron and board. I was on the 28th floor with a pretty decent veiw. Half the window looked at NYNY, Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay while the other half looked at the mountains. Sunrise was beautiful with the clouds hanging over the mountains. But I digress. There were seperate elevators for the top floors and I NEVER waited long for an elevator. The carpet and walls were clean with no graffiti anywhere. Now about the noise. I have read many things about the noise and yes, you can hear people in the hall and when you are in the bathroom you can hear the plumbing from the other room but it is FAR from distracting. If you are THAT bothered by some noise than may I suggest Bellagio. The casino was standard but I liked the lay-out with two big sections of table games and a beautiful poker room. MC also did a great job of filtering the air. Trust me, you'll notice if you're a non smoker! One thing I did notice is the lobby and elevators were seperate from the casino. I went to the Excalibur, what a mess. People, luggage and KIDS were EVERYWHERE!!! I couldn't wait to get out of there. My in-laws stayed at the Flamingo. What a dump. They hated it. The curtains were yellowed and the carpet stained. The vent in the bathroom looked like the inside of a vacuum cleaner bag. No wonder people are getting sick!!

It took awhile for the hot water to come on in the shower, and sometimes our toilet would burble up after taking a shower (water pressure problem?).

We also ate at the buffet for breakfast the day that we left and the breakfast buffet was good, but we would have liked a larger selection of fruit. We also ate at the micro-brewery and Dragon Noodle \u2013 both were excellent. We also had the pizza at Sbbaros which serves large slices of pizza (fast food). There is also a French restaurant called Andres that looked very nice, but we did not eat there. The casino is actually nice and we saw quite a few people winning at the slot machines. The casino is easy to maneuver through, brightly lit, and was not as noisy as some of the other casinos. The arcade was okay, not as large as MGM or NYNY\u2019s arcades.

The Buffet was o.k. but make sure you ask for non smoking and to be seated at the front. The first time we ate there we were seated at the casino end, we found by the time we had trekked back to our tables with the food it was lukewarm. The variety is very good though. The Cafe was excellent for breakfast and lunch, probably for dinner too but we did not try this. They have a food court if you just want a bagel & Coffee or a Macdonalds. You must try the various Ice Cream Milkshakes, they were delicous. The pool was superb, the lazy river and wave pool were great fun. There was never a problem in getting chairs and we always opted for our favoutite spot and got it every day. In our opinion the Casino was the best in Vegas, it had a lovely smell to it, it was clean, well laid out and the staff were excellent, give the cocktail hostess a good tip and she will certainly look after you. The Casino Hosts were amazing, thank you to Julie and Alan, they really took care of us throughout our stay. We were so impressed we are already planning our return trip for Christmas and New Year.

My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience, and we chose the Monte Carlo based on extensive research on sites such as Trip Advisor. I booked a room on the Monte Carlo website for a standard room, it was a great rate at $79 with the web special they were running. When we arrived, we were immediately and easily upgraded (we did not even begin to ask) to a jacuzzi suite at no additional charge. (We do travel weekdays, because we are both in the service industry and must work on the weekends - maybe that had something to do with it) Anyway, the jacuzzi suite was pristine clean and wonderful! The room was spacious and very quiet except for one night when a bachelor party was next to us and the guys got in pretty late and were rowdy. We knocked on the wall and it quieted down. We left a tip every day for our room attendant, with a note asking for extra towels the first day, and so of course our room was very well taken care of. Our bathroom was great with a marble shower/steamroom, and the king sized bed was very comfortable . The view was not of the strip, it was of the highway and a little of the parking lot and resort across the street, but we didn't care about the view, when we were literally in the jacuzzi right up against the window enjoying the glow of the city lights. The pool was amazing, we loved the lazy river and there were of course kids, but they were not unruly or obtrusive at all, everyone was just having a great time together. It was not a hassle for us to get pool chairs, it was crowded but there were staff members ready to help you find a spot. The buffet was okay, but we all know that the buffets are going to be just okay in Vegas (or anywhere). We only ate there once, and actually enjoyed going to the little coffee shop in the food court for lattes, salad and breakfast sandwiches, and took pizza from the food court back up our room-perfect!. The casino is nice, and neither of us is a smoker, so it was bearable to us, and we could actually stay for longer periods of time at the tables.

What a mistake. The guest room walls were so thin it was like we were sharing a room with the families on both sides of us. We called the Front Desk about this matter and the clerk reluctantly admitted that there were quieter rooms. We asked to be switched to a quieter room and within 10 minutes, we had a new room. We went downstairs to get a new key (because they couldn\u2019t have anyone deliver a key to our room within the next hour.) We then realized that we would have to take a separate bank of elevators to our new room. Floors 1-12 in one elevator, 13-26 in another, etc. A Bellman was unavailable for the next 45 minutes, so we so schelped our luggage to our new room. This process took a good 20 minutes because of (and I\u2019m not exaggerating) a 15 minute line for the elevator. There were so many kids with pool toys flooding the lobby and elevators that I thought the Monte Carlo was giving away cash for free and tickets to Disneyland. Our second room smelled like a toilet, so we decided to check out. We certainly couldn\u2019t leave in a huff since it took another 10 minutes to get an elevator. I called the Front Desk and they said, \u201cWe certainly do not want you to leave the Monte Carlo with bad feelings, so we can offer a complimentary buffet for your troubles.\u201d Nice offer, but I can only imagine the line for the buffet. When we asked why all of the kids were at the hotel, the clerk said, \u201cWe had some families decide to stay another day.\u201d How many families would that be, 1000? We stood in the lobby calling other hotels for about an hour. We also made use of their business center where the Internet was available for the low, low price of $1.00 a minute. Once we found a room at the Hilton, we grabbed our luggage and waited another 20 minutes for our car at the Valet.

Location: The resort is located on the Strip located in between the New York, NY Casino and the Boardwalk Hotel and is within easy walking distance to many of the Strip's attractions. Walgreens and CVS are located right next door for any presciptions or last minute items you may need. The hotel: The hotel is very clean. The rooms are great with extreemly cofortable beds. They'll ask you if you want to upgrade to a \"strip view room\" for an extra $10/day if you plan on being in your room a lot, it is worth it. Otherwise you'll face the roof or a wall. Ammenities: The pool area is in a very shady area of the hotel and fills up fast. Better to go before 9:30 for a better seat selection. Flag down a pool attendant and they will grab the chairs and put them where you'd like. The lazy river is great and is the sunny portion of the pool area, and a great spot to people watch. Drinks are fairly expensive (around 7:50 for mixed drink)--- you can save money by ordering a souvineer glass (yard or football) which holds about 4 drinks (costs $10 for the first drink/glass then $9 for refills). The downfall to this hotel in my opinion is restaraunts. They have a few, but nothing fancy. The food court is good for breakfast & lunch if you are a penny pincher.

The main con were the paper thin walls mentioned by other reviewers. We've stayed at many hotels and I don't think we've ever encountered walls that transmitted sound so easily. Pray for quiet neighbors during your stay here. My teenage daughter's review of the MC is as follows: \"The hotel was not as elaborate as the others, however, everyone is very friendly and the service is great. It is very family friendly and doesn't attract a lot of people who aren't staying at the hotel. This way the place is not all the hustle and bustle. For a great room ask for a window facing the strip, at night it is cool!\" Also check out the Lance Burton magic show at the MC, it was a thrill. We were able to upgrade our tickets to the third row by checking with the box office an hour before the show started. Evidently comp tickets given to the casino are returned to the box office shortly before the show. The kids really enjoyed being close as they tried to figure out the tricks behind Lance's magic act.", "Date": "September 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good location, good pool\u201d", "Author": "PJPringle", "ReviewID": "UR2510662", "Content": "I stayed in the Monte Carlo after having spent a few nights at the Sahara hotel.

Most of the staff was pleasant but, unfortunately, we had some incidents that disappointed us on this trip. First, my husband encountered a rude employee while trying to sign up for the One club which ruined his desire to gamble at this casino. I was not there so I can't say what happened but they did lose out on our gambling money. Second, our waiter at breakfast was very rude. We received a 2 for 1 breakfast coupon at check in and used them. Waiter implyed that we were lying as if to say I snuck in while my husband just paid for one meal - it said comp on the ticket which my husband pointed out. He must've not liked that because he was the worst waiter we ever had. I asked for a couple of straws and he threw one on the table and walked away. On his way past me I asked for another straw and he gruffly said he didn't have any. I pointed to the straws in his apron pocket and he took one out and threw it on the table again. He avoided checking on our table so as he walked by my husband politely asked for a cup of coffee which he replied- \"yeah, yeah\". He refilled other tables next to us but never ours. We complained to the seating hostess, Ida B., who was very accomodating and apologetic. She was wonderful and saved our overall impression of the Monte Carlo. She had another waiter take over our table so we wouldn't have to deal with the very unpleasant waiter we originally had. If not for that bad waiter we probably would not have such a bad overall impression of this stay. The dinner wait staff were very nice and the food was good. Also the pool area was o.k. Seemed to be interrupting the guys at the pool desk when asking about towels. No one watching the kiddie pool area - kids and their parents putting the chairs in the water to sit/play on and not taking them out when they left.

Perfect Choice:)\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2363514", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Monte Carlo July 4-6 2004. This was our first time in Vegas and we had the best time imaginable. Our flight to Vegas arrived at 1:00 am on July 4. We picked up our rental car and decided to drive to our hotel to park the car and head out on foot to see Vegas on a Sat. night. We knew we didn't want to book the hotel for that Sat. night because we would be arriving so late that we would just stay up all night and check in as early as they would let us. And that is exactly what we did. We took our own tour of Vegas from 2:30 am till 10:30 am. We parked our car at the Monte, then walked through all the casinos down to Mandalay Bay. Then we crossed the street to the other side of the strip and walked and went in most all the casinos till we found Casino Royal (across from the Mirage). This is where we spent most of our time in Vegas. When I came to Vegas I was not a gambler, but I had never played roulette before, after leaving Vegas, I see how much I have changed. I am a different person after being in Vegas; it changed me. My husband and I spent numerous hours playing roulette with the $0.25 chips at Casino Royal. Playing with quarter chips allowed us to play for hours at a time and win a little and/or loose at a time. We had a budget set for each day and when it was gone, then we were done, but O' how fun it was just to play roulette, it didn't matter if we won or lost, just playing was fun. We did come home with cash in our pockets, so we didn't do to bad. Anyways, let me get to the hotel. We showed up at 10:30am after being out all night and went to check in. The lady at the front desk was incredibly helpful, friendly, and curteous. Check-in isn't till 3 or 4, but she got us in right when we arrived. The deal we got on the Internet was for $69 a night with a view of the pool or strip and a book full of good coupons. At check-in, we asked nicely to see if we could get the strip view, instead of the pool view and she said \"no problem.\" She gave us our key and coupons and we headed to our room. We were so tired from being up all night that we couldn't wait to sleep. Our room was on the 17th floor and had an amazing view. I think we were in room 406, but I'm not positive. The room was spotless, the bed was comfortable, the ice machine and elevators were just down the hall, we never needed maid service because we had enough towels to last us all of the nights we would be there. The room was so cozy and comfortable that I felt like I was at home. I could not have asked for anything more. This hotel has some of the best rates in town, it is in a great location, the staff is helpful and friendly. With one of our coupons we had buy a breakfast buffet from the hotel and get one free. This was the one of the best meals we had our entire trip. The buffet is outstanding!! You get to make your own omelets, then you have every breakfast food imaginable from eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy, waffles, pancakes, bagels, fresh fruit, then come the pastries. These pastries were outstanding!! The best pastries I have ever had. They different fruit filling with a glaze and they melt in your mouth. I was so impressed with everything about the Monte Carlo. I did my research and it payed off!! I would recommend this place to all of you who have questions about where to stay and have never been here to see how Vegas is set up. I knew that I would probably only go to Vegas once in my life and I wanted the best, affordable time possible, and that is what we got. There was only one bad thing to say about the Monte Carlo, which this doesn't even bother me with all the other great things we have experienced here, but it was the thin walls. You can hear the people next to you even when they are talking in their normal voices. You can hear everything. About the pool, we never made it there because we could not keep away from the Casino Royal long enough to see it. We gambled once at the Monte Casino, but it just wasn't as inviting as our favorite place. Things I would recommend doing in Vegas: see a show (we saw The Blue Man Group-good music and involves the audience and Zumanity-a one of a kind Vegas show, good comedy & interesting body movements), eat good (we ate at Wolf Gang Pucks-fabulous and I would recommend the slice prime rib sandwich-WOW! and at Emrils-good, but very expensive $30 meals, ESNP Zone-good cheese fries), gamble (we like Casino Royal, MGM Grand & Binions Downtown), see the strip and downtown (they are two different worlds) and rent a car and drive to the Hoover Dam (it is a short 20 minute drive from the strip and a beautiful place to see).

She and her fiance were staying there, and the wedding was at the Monte Carlo chapel. Since price was nice we decided that would be our home for the whole week. Played Poker, Slots, Blackjack, VP and Craps. Managed to get a $1000 bankroll to last a whole week. Daily Slot Tournament is free and tons of fun. Hourly tournaments from 10 am - 6 pm. Top two in each hour play in finals at 7 pm. I was second at 2 pm and went on to win the 7 pm finals. Everyone who entered throughout the day got a key chain. All finalists got a T-shirt.

This hotel smells amazing, has beautiful rooms, not huge, but plenty of room. The hotel and casino are both bright, and with high ceilings they rarely smelled like smoke. Never met a rude employee, and had 2 wonderful blackjack dealers one night. We ate at Dragon Noodle, Market City Cafe, Nathan's Famous, and the Sunday Champaign Breakfast. All were good to excellent. We also visited the Brew Pub and Houdini's Lounge. Johnny Ray was singing at the lounge and he is AMAZING!! The Brew Pub was fun as an evening hangout. They had a band during the week, and played videos and dance music on the weekends. Hotel rooms do not have safety deposit boxes, but you can get one near the front desk area. I did not think I would like this arrangement before arriving, but it worked great. We were able to get to travelers checks and money without going all the way up to our room, and there was never any other guests at the desk when we got into our box. We got into the box multiple times a day, and the staff was always very nice. Hubby enjoyed the poker room here, and at Mandalay Bay.

Casino was much less busy during the week. We liked that a lot. Weekends were busier, but you could still find what you wanted in a few minutes. Cocktail waitresses were always around and nice.

Of course, asking pleasantly and staying positive doesn't hurt. We ended up on a top floor with a view of the desert, mountains and the resorts down the strip (NY, NY, Mandaly Bay, Luxor), at a price, for a holiday weekend that was great (less than $100 per night including taxes).

The MC offers a hard to beat combination of very reasonable room prices, excellent location on the South Strip, comfortable beds, a pleasant environment and solid on-site restaurants. Rates are probably among the best of the higher-end resorts. Book directly through the MC website...you'll find the best rates there. If you are booking well in advance, review the rates from time to time as they tend to change frequently. The location is excellent...You're in reasonable walking distance of all the major destination resorts on the southern and middle parts of the Strip. There's an awesome CVS next door (a few tips...go there to buy $5.99 floats for the lazy river to avoid the $12 daily rental charge; pick up a styrofoam cooler to keep ice and cold drinks in your room; shop here for any of your basic necessities that you need or may have forgotten). Kind of sounds like an ad for CVS, but it definately enhances the appeal of the MC. The rooms are nice and beds are very comfortable. If you do Vegas correctly, you should not be spending a ton of time in your room and when you do, you should be exhausted. The walls do seem a bit thin, but it's not really a big deal. The on-site dining does not offer a ton of options, but the MC Pub & Brewery and Dragon Noodle are stand-outs. The pool is probably average by Vegas standards, but it certainly does the job if you want to soak up some rays or take a dip (if you want eye candy, go straight to the Hard Rock). The casino is fine...Same slots as everywhere else, plenty of table games. If anything, the MC serves as a great \"basecamp\" for your Vegas expedition. As mentioned above, there are many features that make the MC an attractive place to stay, however it's not the flashiest place and it doesn't have the wide range of entertainment/dining/shopping options that other Vegas resorts offer. But you can seek all that stuff out by walking or taking a quick taxi ride to wherever you want to go.

Someone found the great 5 night deal with the Monte Carlo, so we booked it. The reviews here made me really worried, because I've had bad experiences in Vegas before... well, we got there at 10am (this was pretty early for check in), and walked up to the counter with no wait. The girl at the counter didn't even blink an eye that we were so early, and I asked her for the best room at the moment. She gave us an awesome room on the 14th floor with great views of the strip. When our friends arrived 5 hours later and told the person at the counter the room number that we were in, they got rooms all around us, with no problems whatsoever. No tipping necessary, either, and the people at the counter had personalities - no robots!! Overall, everyone loved their stay - all of us had different interests - some stayed at the pool 6 hours a day, others gambled, others ate... the pool area is okay - drinks are very expensive, of course. The restaurant is good when you're coming back from the clubs at 6am (note: the Quizno's just north of the hotel is also open 24 hours). The food court is good, if you want fast food (note: the big Coca-Cola food court is pretty much across the street), and it's close to everything. I've heard that the Lance Burton show at the hotel is AWESOME, but, I wasn't able to go. It's very easy to walk up and down the strip from the Monte Carlo, also making it a good place to stay. The only complaint that I would have was that the housekeeping services were totally average. We left a very good tip the first night, and only the bare minimum was done. We didn't tip after that, and the service didn't get any better or any worse. Don't expect them to do any more than they have to... Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet place (it's nice to come back to after spending all day and night surrounded by loud noise and music) that is really nice (definitely not motel quality like some people made it out to be) and accessible.

Positives-you don't have to walk through their casino to reach room elevators (NICE), and parking is very easy to access...without having to walk forever like at many LV hotels. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the exercise (I walk for exercise here at home), but I don't need to waste valuable time going from parking garages to the inside on my trips. The food court is a nice option for a quick pick me up, and not crowded. Our room on the 24th floor with a strip view (which I requested upon check-in) was average, nothing remarkable though. We didn't have an issue with any noise, other than the occasional loud voice in the hallway. The Brew Pub on premises is great. Walked right in on a Saturday night around 6:30PM! Good food and beer. Negatives: Arrived at the hotel around 12:45PM, and was told that the room had been vacated, but the maid would have to clean it first prior to our checking in. Okay, fine I guess we can find something to do for awhile....afterall it is LV!! I left our luggage with the bell desk, and was told to check back about 3:00PM when check in begins. We came back shortly after 3, room still hadn't been cleaned. So we went to the food court to get a bite to eat. Finally at 3:45 we could \"officially check in\". I guess if check in is after 3PM, I shouldn't expect anything different, however after spending way too much money for these 2 nights, it would have been a bonus to have the room earlier and therefore maybe would have checked out the pool. (Never saw it) The second negative would be their steakhouse. Our family wanted to go out for a nice meal on our last night in LV, and walked into the steakhouse around 7:00 PM. There were not too many diners at this point. The hostess said she could seat us (3 people) at 8:30!!! Were they expecting a crowd?

The design of the hotel is good and no room is very far from the main bank of elevators. Other hotels in Vegas require LONG walks to get to and from one's room.

I called housekeeping and requested that this not happen again during our stay. It was a minor problem but I did not feel that housekeeping on our floor (25) was anything to write home about.

Stayed here in 2001 right after 9/11 and it was a wonderful place to stay. So wonderful that we decided to return in January of this year. BIG MISTAKE! We spent three wonderful nights at the Golden Nugget and planned the last two nights so we could enjoy the strip. Since we had such a great stay previously at the Monte Carlo, we booked a room for two nights and checked in on Jan. 4th. Check-in was fine, room was fine. The problems occurred when we hit the casino floor. Tried to cash a check and couldn't. Since I don't write checks for anything that runs through the \"merchant system\", our credit information was not in their files. Casino suggested we open a line of credit and we'd be fine. So, we did that. They acted like it would be no time at all to handle that and it turned out that the next morning they still hadn't been able to do anything with our application. When we were finally approved, we find out that we couldn't access the line of credit as we were promised...........you had to take $500 increments as they decided on your rating of play and they would dole the money out as they saw fit. Even though it was MY money!! Their explaination was that we didn't have much play in the casino from the night before. Go figure.........we COULDN'T get a check cashed because of the system they used to verify checks and we didn't play enough in the casino. After becoming frustrated with it all, decided to talk to Casino host and got the runaround there too. I told them if they had been honest with me about how the line of credit worked, I would have just used my credit card or ATM card and gotten money and we COULD Have played the night before. Nobody cared and quite frankly, they weren't very accommodating - just let me know that we hadn't played enough for them to do anything for us. We spent all morning trying to get the line of credit thing taken care of and finally decided this was crazy. We came for relaxation and a vacation, NOT to be stressed out. So, we checked out and went to Bally's where we had a good stay previously too. What a difference!! Bally's cashed a $500 check, no problem. They cashed another one later on that day for my husband, and there was no problem at all. The room was larger, cleaner (no mold on the shower curtain and the furnishings were newer too). It was $10 more, but I'd have paid 10x that for the level of service we received at Bally's compared to Monte Carlo. Instead of hearing why they COULDN'T help us out, we were asked what they could do to help us out. I talked to many people who have told me they experienced the same thing at the Monte Carlo and will never go there again - not even to gamble.

The service is very nice, and the facilities are excellent. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the pool area here to be among the best in Vegas, right up there with the MGM and Mandalay Bay. My one problem with the facilities was that my room had an APPALLING smell of smoke. I'm a smoker, and I asked for a smoking room, but I'll never do that again. Seriously, I opened the door and was just HIT with the smell. I bring scented candles with me when I travel, but they couldn't tackle this disgusting smell, either -- I just wound up with vanilla cigarette smoke. From now on, I'll get non-smoking rooms and just smoke in the casino... I love the food court. I particularly love the bagel shop in the food court. It's one of the few places in Vegas where you can get fresh, semi-healthy food quickly and at a reasonable price. I stop by there even when I'm staying at another hotel. I also love the fact that the table games in the casino are somewhat separated from the slot machines. When you're at a table, particularly in the center aisle, the slot crowds and noises barely infringe upon you. However, getting to the oasis of table games can be an adventure, as the narrow pathways between slot machines get jammed up with glassy-eyed slot zombies. I suggest you bring a cattle prod to nudge them out of the way. However, this is the case in most casinos. All in all, I would be happy to stay at the Monte Carlo all the time except for one little problem. I can't seem to win in this casino. For the last 3-4 years, I've lost every single time I've played here (at most places, I win sometimes and lose other times). It doesn't matter how good the place is or how cheap the rates are.

I enjoyed the resort for several reasons: 1. it was definitely less crowded than the other casinos on the strip. 2. The resort is located in the middle of everything. 3. The wave pool was a plus (be sure to get there no later than 10am for the best seats). 4. Check in and out was a breeze. 5. VERY AFFORDABLE. We did not experience any plumbing problems or noisy neighbors during my stay. The rooms are simple and well maintained. I stayed on the 11th floor (non-smoking floor-just one of many offered) and I had a fantastic view of the pool below and the mountains off in the distance. I must admit that as the night gets jumping in Vegas, I wished on a couple nights, that there was a night club inside the Monte Carlo, but with so many options within walking distance, it wasn't a big deal. The huge sports bar inside the Monte Carlo offered wonderful give aways during the Monday night football game, compliments of ESPN. I recommend this resort for travelers that are in need of an escape minus the madness that can sometimes happen at some of the more \"20-something\" resorts. I would definitely stay at the Monte Carlo again, especially if the price is right!", "Date": "October 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fond du Lac, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cWonderful first time!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1387542", "Content": "My husband and I along with our 2 sons and (wife & fiance') in their mid-20's joined us 9/17-9/22 in Vegas. This was the 1st time my husband and I had been in Vegas). We stayed at the Monte Carlo. Upon arriving at McCarren Aiport we shuttled to the Dollar Car Rental and our sons rented a mini-van. Son #1 did all the driving and did a super (altho speed demon) job. Alot of reviews say don't rent a car & don't drive down the strip. Well, if you go with the flow it moves right along. Pretty at nite and interesting to see all the walkers from a vehicle. We never rented a cab once altho during the week we walked and walked. We only used the van when we went to Fremont Street, Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon. The Monte Carlo was a nice hotel. Not quite so overwhelming. Had a bit of a delay checking in as it was difficult (so the gal said) finding 3 rooms on the same floor. Our son's rooms had a nice view. Our view sucked. We checked our luggage at 1:00 in the aft with the belle hop and were told our rooms would be ready at 3:00. NOT! Also not ready at 4:00. By 4:30 we found some employees roaming the halls and finally a woman in charge said she would see that our rooms were ready by 4:30. From then on, we had no problems. The Monte Carlo had some nice little eatery shops including McDonald's for a quick fix and the Microbrewery was very, very nice. $3.00 tap beer. Heh, we're from Wisconsin! We saw the Blue Man Group one nite but for $100 a ticket, I would have prefered some other show. We walked constantly and we all were really pooped. Had to change shoes alot. Lots of sites to see. Can't believe the expense of construction at these hotels & casinos. The weather was really hot for Sept. but gorgeous! Great in the early a.m. and later at nite. Hated the porn pushers. (We called them card flippers). Especially such young kids. We debated about taking a helicpter tour one day but found out the next a.m. that one crashed and all 7 people were killed. Yikes! We were more sight seers than gamblers. Alot of the tables looked too intimidating for us anyway. And very busy. One evening we ate at Lary's Steak House. (the waitress was very unimpressive and when we complained the manager took offense.) I guess they don't appreciate constructive criticism. Oh well. We had much more fun at the Harley Davidson Cafe! Needless to say, we packed alot in to 5 days. But, my husband and I are talking about going back again next Sept.", "Date": "October 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cProbably Most Accessible Hotel in LV!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1371739", "Content": "My friend and I went to Vegas in the early summer....hot!!! We had stayed at other large chain, more expensive hotels before, but wanted to try the Monte Carlo due to the great price...like $60 midweek or something crazy! We arrived, and check in was not too slow, as we arrived at night. The room had an awesome veiw of the pool and the lovely twinkling Vegas strip hotels. The bed was decently comfy, but the shower was a little awkward (low shower spout...I think we had a handicapped room?), but nicely decorated. The room service food, well, just dont waste your time waiting for it, and dont subject your tastebuds to it unless you want dirt to sound yummy! Ha ha! You're better off eating at the food court. Their Beer garden cafe or whatever its called, had great food, and delicious beers! Try the sampler if u want to taste them all but not get wasted! The good part about the Monte Carlo is that you do not have to walk far to get anywhere in the hotel. And you dont have to walk through the casino or shops to get to your room! Very friendly casino staff! The pool area was nice, especially to cool off from the heat. Not very spectacular, but I didnt go to Vegas to swim. I would stay here again, but maybe spend a little more to get a more private, larger room, and just eat somewhere else. I would recommend it!

Were not quite sure of what to expect after reading the reviews, but it was a pleasant experience. We arrived there at about 11 AM on a Thurs. Check-in was quick and smooth. Staff seemed very nice. We stayed in their standard room on the 19th floor. The room was average but had some of the softest pillows and bed we had ever slept on. The bathroom, on the other hand, was below average. Water leaking from the wall was an issue. Also the bath tub/shower combo is always dissapointing. The room was rarely cleaned during our 3 night stay. We had to call cleaning services 3 times, but the room was still not cleaned until late evening on our 2nd night. The pool was nice, especially the wave pool, but very small so it was hard to find a spot if you arrived after 11 AM. The microbrewery was a nice place to hang out but make sure you specify to the hostess if you're only there to hang out and have a beer,or else you might get a scolding from some of the servers. Casino was average, there are better places to spend your gambling money. It was nice to have a Mcdonalds and Sbarros right in the hotel. As mentioned before, rooms can be reached without going through the casino, which is a plus.

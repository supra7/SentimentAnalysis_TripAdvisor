We checked across the hall and saw that some king size rooms had a nice view of the marina that was across from us. Other reviews have commented on the elevator, and I agree it is small, but we managed just fine and often used the stairs. I noticed that there were accessible rooms handily located on the ground floor. The breakfast was cereal, make-you-own waffles, pastries, yogurt, toast, that sort of thing. Denny's is a short walk away if you want bacon and eggs. The breakfast room was well maintained. Here I saw families, older couples, and a few businesspeople. There was an outdoor pool area with lounge chairs but it was a little bit too cool outside to try, but it looked appealing and would be popular in warmer weather, I imagine. The neighborhood, which I think is called Point Loma, has small restaurants, stores, and the marina all just outside. There is a huge shopping complex a short cab ride away. I thought we might be isolated from all the sights, but since we've been to San Diego before it didn't bother us.

Staff (especially co-manager, Juyita) was courteous, helpful and accommodating. Rooms are large enough, but oversized furniture and interior design don't maximize spatial quality. Room 202 had nice alcove adjacent bathroom, but not much of a view. Wet area (including dressing alcove) nicely outfitted (granite flat surfaces, including vanity). Fridge and microwave in room with adequate access to restaurants and grocery. The hallways are the most notable detraction - need updating, and hall lights at night shine through under door. Neither of these should otherwise deter guests. Rooms are clean and housekeeping staff is attentive to cleanliness. Breakfast is adequate - nothing spectacular - and self-serve hot waffles available. I did take the opportunity to pass on (via private forum) a few business \"tweaks\" to management, primarily guest room space utilisation and healthy menu offerings for breakfast.

We had a one king bed room (which is really small, the only thing that helps is the high ceilings) and a two double beds room (which is actually quite spacious and nice). What we liked: you could open the windows, there is a microwave and fridge in each room, the bed and pillows were awesome, really comfy, high speed internet, free parking, great housekeeping, and greatest asset of this hotel: location! What we didn't like: smell, small details such as scratches or stains on the wall and on the door, the bathroom vanity (I can't even describe it, but it was weird - see the photo), rusty hinges, small holes in the bathroom wall, show lack of maintenance. The bathroom is in great need of an upgrade, the towels were clean but old and worn - they need to be replaced. The continental breakfast was good, there were several choices: cereal, pastries, fruit, yogurt even waffles on Saturday and Sunday. The breakfast room, though, is quite small, only 4 tables and it gets hard to find an empty table after 9. While it was not perfect, it was ok, we didn't spend too much time in the room anyway during the day. And we booked it through Expedia, so we paid a reasonable price (even though a month ago, for the same money we stayed at Hampton Inn and there is no comparison!). Would I stay there again? Probably not! There are so many choices for the same money.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cgreat location but room had thin walls and needs some work!\u201d", "Author": "Nichobemo", "ReviewID": "UR30130284", "Content": "The people were very friendly and the breakfast (waffle iron) was very good.

However, it also gets extra points for a few amenities you often don't find in hotels with price tags twice this high. I stayed here twice - on both ends of a scuba diving liveaboard trip out to see some great white sharks, long story - and my review applies to both rooms. As I've mentioned in other reviews, certain things usually score extra credit points from me: good ventilation and water pressure, a comfy bed, a quiet room, and access to snacks and soft drinks. This place scored high on all those counts, honestly. Air conditioning worked great, the rooms were comfortable, the bathrooms had recently been remodeled and were quite spacious. One room was just average size, but one was huge! This place actually is something of a flophouse for several companies that run trips out to see the sharks, and some outfits that do sportfishing, so you may want to call ahead to double check room availability. I screwed up my travel plans, then called at 8 AM to book a room for an extra night and it turned out to have been a great thing...I heard later the place filled up shortly thereafter. A couple of real extra credit points to this hotel: There was a fridge and a microwave in each room; the drink and snack machines were amply stocked, not broken, and conveniently located in the lobby - and, oh joy! A change machine! Best of all, this hotel was silent as the grave. I stayed up super late one night and was not awakened early the next morning by loud talking, slamming doors, any of that nonsense. Also, there's plenty of parking, and the hotel is located very near some really wonderful restaurants (we liked the Fish Grotto and, aw heck, another one the name of which escapes me right now...but seriously, there are several outstanding joints within easy walking distance. There's also a Denny's a block away and I had no trouble ordering a pizza late one night.) The neighborhood was just fine, not frightening, and you're within sight of the incredibly beautiful harbor. You're also right on top of the airport, and yet somehow not within the flight path...I didn't hear much jet noise. The Internet worked great!! This one gets REAL points from me...I've stayed in \"luxury\" hotels where the wireless signal was terrible, or they charged $30 per night or something absurd. At the Ramada, I got a strong, clear signal, no trouble logging on, and no need for a \"bridge\" for rent from the front desk or similar foolishness. I'd stay here again in a hot second.

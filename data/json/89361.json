My family members were of all ages, a number of them with special needs, and all the normal chaos and dysfunction that goes along with a big family event like a wedding! While the event wasn't at the Sheraton, you wouldn't have known that based on how they supported everyone. From the valet to the front desk to Rena the outstanding concierge, they greeted us all by name, kept us moving in the right directions, and always did it with a great attitude and a friendly smile. Getting even two people in my family to agree on a place to eat is a small miracle, and from restaurant reservations to transportation support to special needs in the room, they handled everything without missing a beat. From my perspective, any hotel can have a great staff member. This hotel has a great staff. Everyone is clearly enabled to not just respond to your needs, but to anticipate them. I felt so fortunate I had chosen this hotel because their service was so good, I didn't have to worry about my elderly parents or my young cousins or my aunt that can't make up her mind. My family is like herding cats, and the staff at the Sheraton Inner Harbor were like the cat whisperers!

It never used to be an issue here but has become one over the last few years. They really don't seem to get that you are the guest and deserve at least a modicum of civility, let alone an acknowledgment that you exist as you stand waiting for one of them to decide he or she is ready to speak to you. Then hardly look up at you as they \"serve\" (loosest sense of the word) you. I always feel as if I am an inconvenience that they are desperate to be rid of. Amazing how their attitude completely changes depending on what you look like. I have actually had the humiliation on two occasions of having a staff member call forward a guest who was clearly behind me in the queue as they were obviously more the kind of person the staff wanted to deal with.

Forget the TV its the normal tosh, 2 minutes of programming followed by 5 minutes of ads. Bathroom was clean and well appointed, however one thing that continues to surprise me and worry me is that the Hairdryer sits adjacent to the sink so very possible to get it wet unless you move it. Surely this should be the mounted type on the wall, (out of the reach of children). Room service is expensive however you can order food from the bar and take it to the room yourself.

Just to give you a little feedback is the area in the parking lot isn't clearly marked to get to the lobby. We parked in the green section. We saw an elevator but the signs next to the elevator had arrows pointing away from the elevator saying \"lobby\" . We followed the signs to the lobby and it took us to a stairwell and we had to walk up 4 flights of steps to get to the lobby. The signs had us take the steps. We appreciate the exercise but not when we were tired and had to carry luggage. We were a little fired up when checking in and the nice gentleman that checked us in was so nice and apologized with a smile for the inconvienience when we told him about the signs giving us directions by way of the stairs. Once we got there and check in, everything was just perfect. The staff made it so nice, I can't say enough nice things about them. I especially want to recongnize Crystal.

However, we had the pleasure of being assisted by Leroy Smith and we were so glad!! He greeted us with a warm smile and professional attitude...he was also impeccably groomed, which for me is a huge plus. Nothing worse than seeing an employee looking thrown together. He never mentioned the fact that we were hours early for check-in; he simply found us a room, gave us our key and bid us a good day. Here is the rest of the breakdown: Hotel: VERY clean! I even saw a woman going up and down the escalator with a sweeper. I was impressed. The room: We were in room 726; a very nice corner room with ok views. The room was SPOTLESS. Again...very impressed. Staff: The gentlemen at the front (doorman I believe) were very nice. They always greeted us as we came in and left out and were very good with assiting us with cabs and information. All of the staff members I came in contact with were extremely pleasant. Another plus! Restaurant: We ate at Orioles Grille Bar for breakfast. Juan was our server and was very good. He was very attentive but not overbearing. There was also a woman who was refreshing the food who was very nice (I want to say her name was Linda but I'm not sure). The food was pretty good. No complaints. We also ate at Orioles for a late night snack. My husband got a cheeseburger and I had loaded fries. Both were good. Even though we came in 15 minutes before quitting time, they took our order with a smile. Very much appreciated. Location: Very close to everything. Prime location for entertainment, restaurants and of course the Inner Harbor.

One of my main reasons for visiting Baltimore was to go to the National Aquarium. I made a big mistake and didn't buy tickets for the Aquarium ahead of time so by the time I went to book them online, all of the morning times were sold out. Because of my schedule I thought I might have to miss seeing the Aquarium, but when I called the hotel front desk, they said they had tickets that were members tickets which allowed you to go in anytime--and they turned out to be cheaper than buying them directly from the Aquarium!

We could also hear their entire phone conversations. I turned on the noisemaker of my iPhone at full blast but still could not drown out the noises coming from the other room.

The beds and pillows were good for us though the sheets were a bit rough. The bathroom was updated though I can't understand why hotels seem to replace everything but the shower heads and recepticles. Ventilation in the bathroom seemed non-existant and it led to the room being a bit humid as well. I was pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel although housekeeping never seemed to make it to my room earlier than 2:30 or 3pm.

However, when we returned to our room that evening, it felt like we were in an entirely different hotel. There was an extremely noisy party going on on the second floor, the people attending the party appeared to be very sketchy, there were security guards (associated with the party) all over the place. I didn't really feel safe at all. In addition, many of the people attending the party appeared to be staying in the hotel -- they were loud, noisy, and drunk in the hallways and in neighboring rooms. While the front desk was responsive when I called to complain, I don't believe it was within their ability to control the noise level or their behavior of the guests staying at the hotel or attending the party that evening.

For some reason the Sheraton hotel believes it is OK to give a customer a fold out closet bed for 3 nights because they haven't sold the \"attached suite\" room as an \"attached suite\". And they forgot the mattress cover. I made 2 face washers filthy by wiping down all of the smeared and dusty surfaces such as desk, phone, bedside table ... areas used on a daly basis by most guests. They do offer Starbucks coffee in the room but that doesn't help if you prefer white coffee. No fridge, no microwave. You can hear everything in the hallways and in the attached room next door. As for service ... there is just something terribly WRONG with the attitude of the workers in Baltimore, it's as bad as Atlanta - generally speaking. I went to the front desk later in the evening and all three people were sitting down below the counter - it was unapproachable as if a guest might be interrupting THEM. That said, the ladies who worked the lounge on the 14th floor were quite personable and helpful. Gone are the days of first class, 5 star service but at least these ladies warmed up to guests that arrived for a quick bite. That said, I just don't think that Hotel management encourages \"professionalism\" in the work place anymore ... again, generally speaking. One guy at the front desk though very nice had poor dental hygiene and when I went down to the cafe for an expensive toasted cheese sandwich they fobbed me off with a velveeta cheese atrocity. I remember when the Sheraton was great, the customer was always heard and valued, the customer NEVER felt they were interrupting or inconveniencing or expecting too much from hotel employees. It's a sad sign of the times ... mostly found in Baltimore and Atlanta. Looking to end on a positive note, as I think this hotel's downfall is that it's in Baltimore, so if you HAVE to be in Baltimore the location is right next to the convention center and a few blocks from the water front. I have stayed in a number of downtown hotels and regretfully this one is probably as good so as you'll get so I will recommend it.

Randi was amazing taking care of everything for us so we literally had nothing to worry about. Any concern we had, she addressed before our big day, and the day of the event, she and her staff had everything completely undercontrol and we had one of the smoothest and most enjoyable wedding ceremonies and receptions imaginable!! It was so convenient having everything all in one location, and with a professional staff (both the hotel staff and the event staff), the weekend went off without a hitch.

The Sheraton Inner Harbor Baltimore has some pluses and some minuses, making it.... ehh..... Pluses: Location - VERY close to Inner Harbor, easy to find, walking distance to Oriole Park, etc. Lobby - Has free internet access on computers. Parking - Option for self parking to save a few bucks. Minuses: Front Desk Staff - The young lady that checked us in was very curt, and seemed very inexperienced in hotel customer service. From her saying \"Next, when we were in line like this was a supermarket\", and no \"Welcome, or how are you?\". She just punched a bunch of keys, didn't ask high or low floor, how many keys,etc. She didn't tell us the usual 'We have you down for one night, 2 doubles, blah blah blah.\" either. Then her fake niceness and smile at the end of checkin made it even better - not. And when we asked about breakfast the next morning, the man at the front desk was also very rude. Not a good first impression. Hotel Decor - You can certainly tell this hotel is very old and worn. It wasn't dumpy, but some maintenance is going to be crucial very soon. Hallways - The hallways are also worn (stained carpet, scuffed up walls, etc.) The decor here was outdated. Room - The room (especially the bathroom) was pretty small. The beds were small, uncomfortable, and the linens were thin and very noisy when moved. The thermostat was very difficult to figure out and it kept kicking on and off during the night and very loudly I might add (it woke me up about every half and hour). So, obviously, didn't sleep that well. The bathroom was small and two people could barely fit. Even the flat screen TV was weird. The picture was too bright and all the people and all the scenery were white as a ghost! The coffee maker was pretty good and the view was very nice, though. Parking - Although it was good there was self parking, it was VERY difficult. The spots were tight, it was a long walk up to the lobby, and it was very dark and dim. It didn't seem all that secure either so take your valuables with you. Also, you only save 7 bucks a night for self versus valet. Do valet for the extra cost. Breakfast - The only option for breakfast is on the second floor in a restaurant. It is EXTREMELY overpriced! A small yoghurt parfait was 15 dollars. Uhh, WHAT? There's also no Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, etc. anywhere near the hotel so you're stuck with that breakfast. I've been to this property before (about 8 years ago). Hotels are supposed to get BETTER over time (renovations, feedback=changes, maintenance, etc.) Unfortunately, this one got worse! I wouldn't exactly recommend this to a friend due to the minuses said above. Also, the value wasn't very good either.

You walk into the lobby and it was always fragrant, well-lit and pleasant. However, the rooms themselves do show some wear particularly the carpets, which seemed very grungy. Our room had the basics: computer desk, desk chair, king bed, TV, dresser and two arm chairs. There was no ottoman, which I always appreciate for elevating my feet. Our room was fairly large for two people. It would have been nice to have a fridge and/or a safe though. For the price and location (and I checked bunches of hotels) I believe we got wonderful value at the Sheraton. This was one instance where my husband knew best. You walk out the hotel\u2019s front door and walk for a block and you\u2019re right at the Inner Harbor! In terms of the additional charges \u2013 as of when we stayed there Internet was $9.95 per day and self-parking was $25 per day. We couldn\u2019t get out of the parking fee but used my husband\u2019s Droid phone for Internet. We just hooked the phone to our laptop and it worked fine. Internet speed was very fast too, which was surprising. I truly hate paying for Internet when traveling on business and I especially hate it when traveling for pleasure. A block away from the Sheraton is the Visitor Center. I strongly advise everyone to stop by (even if you\u2019ve done a lot of research on what you\u2019d like to see or do). On the first afternoon we were in Baltimore we stopped by the Visitor Center and chatted a bit. We decided to do the 90-minute Baltimore tour ($24.95 per adult). You were picked up in an air-conditioned bus in front of the Visitor Center. We found our guide to be knowledgeable but \u201ccrusty\u201d ;-) The tour was definitely worth it because it gave us a lot of Baltimore history and allowed us to get our bearings and see the stuff we wanted to visit in-depth later or on a future visit. With only 2 days or so, we had to pick and choose our activities. We\u2019d previously visited the Aquarium and the Maryland Science Center, so on this trip we decided to just bum around. I\u2019d read about the highly-rated American Visionary Arts Museum in Federal Hill, and it was definitely worth it. I\u2019ve been to lots of museums all over, and I can honestly say AVAM was one of the coolest \u2013 primarily because it is art by people who were not trained as artists. Maybe because I\u2019m a paper crafter I appreciated the work more, but it was an experience \u2013 a good one. The museum\u2019s gift shop (Sideshow) is a treasure trove. Sideshow was one of the coolest museum shops with literally tons of stuff. Staff are very friendly and prices were reasonable \u2013 from a dollar and up. You cannot take pictures at the museum, which was a bummer. While we were there the primary exhibit was Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. Some of the exhibits of work by African American artists were particularly moving and impactful. I was particularly awed by the work of Eugene Von Bruenchenhein. His work was so vivid and mind-blowing. If you go (and I suggest you do) stop by the Carnival Mirrors on the top floor. Really cool. I also loved the carving of Lady Liberty made out of driftwood by a Louisiana artist. Once you exit the main building there\u2019s more. There\u2019s a lovely garden with more sculptures and a cool wooden sculpture. Don\u2019t forget to take a picture with the 8 foot glass egg (Cosmic Galaxy Egg by Andrew Logan). Walk past the egg and enter a new exhibit of contemporary art pieces in the James Rouse Visionary Center. I particularly loved the oversize Divine piece by Andrew Logan. I\u2019m not sure this museum is really kid-friendly, because it is so introspective. It\u2019s a thinking-person\u2019s museum not a \u201cwatch-the-pretty-picture museum\u201d. Do with that description as you wish. We ate at M&S Grill one time for a late lunch (prompt and attentive service and good food, but a bit pricey). We stopped by the Cheesecake Factory for lunch, got a table, and was ignored by our waiter/waitress for a good 15 minutes. We never saw him or her so we walked out! Life\u2019s too short. For breakfast we ate at Brown Sugar at the mall by the Inner Harbor. They opened early and though service was served with \u201ccharacter\u201d the food was tasty. I had the BLT both days we were there. My husband liked the home fries and the sausage patties so he had that both days. We had dinner one night at Uno. Food was OK. Place was packed so we ate at one of the bar tables. I love seafood and my husband does not so we did not eat at Phillips or any other seafood place. Quite frankly I found the smell at the mall where the Phillips seafood buffet was located to be a bit off-putting. All told, for the convenience of the location, I believe we got good value for what we paid at the Sheraton Inner Harbor. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Please feel free to send me a PM with any additional questions about travel in the DC metro area.

The hotel was beautiful and easy to find, parking garage was ok although you had an additional charge of $25.00 on top of the $185.00 stay. I thought that was ridiculous. The staff was friendly and helpful, the bar/restaurant was ok, I think the air was broken in the back, they said they were working on it but we were hot eating our late night snack. All in all the hotel was very nice though, beautiful room, incredible bed that we actually slept until 9:30, that never happens!!! The place was very clean. The Inner Harbor on the other hand was a mess!!! AVOID it on the 4th of July!!! It was mobbed with people and tons of cops, which would normally would make me feel better but I was on edge the entire time. They were patroling from the air too. I never saw so many cops, I kept expecting a building to be blown up or something even worse. I stopped to ask a cop if there was something i should be nervous about and his response was \"Yes, you are in one of the most dangerous cities in America\" he wasn't joking and i wanted to go home after that. The fireworks were great, really one of the best we have seen yet. We sat with our legs dangling over the bulkhead. This was very nervewracking as the crowd was so huge. I kept thinking we would be the first to be pushed in anything happened. In my opinion the inner harbor has gone downhill since I was there last. I was less then impressed with it. The gallery was nice but so very crowded. I felt like we were totally in the inner city, I was glad my kids were not with me and I will not be taking them to the inner harbor anytime soon. At least during a holiday. Our only complaint about the hotel to speak of was that they charged our card a $50.00 authorization fee for the room then they charged our card TWICE for the room. Once for the hold and once for the stay. All in all our card had over $200.00 just for holding our room. Do not use a debit card to reserve your room. They take a week or more refunding your money AFTER our funds had already been taken out to pay for the room. Be careful with that, they have a sign on the front desk when you sign in but it wasn't clear and didn't mentiont the $50.00 charge also.

It's a very easy walk, via skywalk, to the inner harbor shops and restaurants, it's a quick cab ride to Federal Hill, and it's easy to get to. The staff was very helpful, quick to correct any needs. One night we noticed that there weren't any clean towels left after housekeeping left. I called the front desk and was informed that due to the weather, SNOW!!!, the linen truck was running behind. The towels were delivered when we got back to our room at the end of the day. We walk almost everywhere we go so it's in a great location to visit all of the sights of Baltimore. The hotel is showing a little wear, but every hotel I've ever stayed in has something that can be improved upon. In this case, $30 per night parking but that's the going rate in Baltimore.

My son became very ill and I called the front desk to ask the following questoins: Where is the closest Target? Ellen had no idea. Where is the closest 24 hour pharnmacy? Ellen had no idea. Is there a laundrymat close by that is open? Ellen had no idea. So, if you are traveling with small children and want to know the answers, here they are...There is a Target within 10 mins of downtown Baltimore, there is a 24 hour Rite Aid in town at Charles and Light and there is a laundrymat at the top of the hill on Broadway that stays open until midnight. Ellen did make some calls for me but I had to find out some information on my own. I invite Ellen to transfer guests to someone who actually knows Baltimore or to get educated. The housekeeping staff was amazing. Without going into any detail, I needed to get more towels, washcloths and a new comforter. The person they sent to my room was incredible. She was less concerned about their linens and more concerned about my son. My only other issue was the room service prices are absolutely ridiculous. Cereal is $17.00! Are you kidding me? We ordered a waffle, an American breakfast (2 eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast and juice and coffee, a diet Pepsi and an apple juice for our son and it was over $60.00! Also, when our son was sick we had to eat in so my husband went to the Orioles Grill and ordered a 12\" pizza and brought back 4 beers and that too was almost $60.00.

The room was clean, nicely equipped, and had absolutely fantastic views. The headboard was crooked. That's the only negative. 2. Outstanding staff. We checked in early, and our original room was not ready. Latoya at the front desk researched it and got us into a new room right away. She did this unsolicted - a high point. 3. We paid a special rate of $99 a night. I would say that our room and experience was worth $150 a night. 4. The location is fantastic. If you're not leaving Baltimore Inner Harbor, no need to rent a car. Enterprise right in hotel if you want to go somewhere. 5. The front desk staff was extremely attentive, helpful, and genuinely happy to help you. As were all the fellas at the front ready to open doors at a moment's notice. With a smile, at that. Cons: 1.

This review may be biased due to the fact that there was a big convention/reunion at the hotel with hundreds of young adults---which I don't think the hotel's staff managed very well. Throughout the weekend, we had to push through crowds to get to the elevators---which by Saturday night weren't working properly. Sunday morning when we were leaving, there were cups on the elevator floor, and empty champagne bottles on tables in the lobby . We also had an incident with our neighbor---again, not the hotel's fault, but I don't think they handled it in the best possible way. Our first night there, our neighbors had an argument and the guy stormed out only to return at 3am and start banging on the door, and ultimately kicking in the wall next to the door. We called security but I honestly don't think they ever arrived. Due to the large volume of people at the hotel, we must have seen 10 people wearing t-shirts that said Security, so unless they were overwhelmed with other complaints (which was possible) there should have been no reason they didn't come up. We complained to the manager on duty the next morning and she said that it was being handled at a higher level---in my opinion, they should have thrown him out---there was substantial damage to the wall, so they had every right. I was worried the rest of the weekend that there were would be a repeat performance, and considered asking to move rooms, but other than some occasional shouting, they behaved. Also, we were staying on the Club Level, and you don't expect this type of behavior there. By Saturday, several of the elevators weren't working at all, and the ones that were stopped at every floor---where there were crowds of partying people waiting to get on. I have to say when we did make it to our floor, it was like an oasis of calm compared to the other floors---even with the rowdy neighbors. Our room was fine---comfy king-sized bed, flat screen TV, nice bath amenities, and a great view of Camden Yards----going to an Oriole game was the highlight of the weekend. I wasn't really impressed with the Inner Harbor or the restaurants there. We planned on going to Fell's Point to eat, but for various reasons didn't get there.

We chose the hotel primarily for its location and through for $225/night it would be pretty decent - WRONG! We pulled up to the hotel to check in and pulled in behind other cars in the driveway area in front of the hotel. My husband and I each grabbed our rolling bags and went into the hotel to check-in. Halfway into the lobby, 3 guys working at the hotel told us we needed to move our car, we indicated we were checking in and that we would move the car after we checked in but they insisted we move the car NOW. Which we did but didn't see the point in this as we were not blocking anyone, in fact, we were the ONLY car in the check-in drive. So, I went back outside and moved my car up about 10 feet - totally pointless. On to check in - the guy who checked us in was rude and confused - we wanted to check out with another card instead of the one on file and this caused mass confusion. The other people working the front desk were also rude and were having personal conversations and joking - just not professional. We checked in and went up to the room, of course, no one asked if we needed help with our bags so we just took them up ourselves. The room was, in a word, gross. The bed literally had a huge sinkhole in the middle of it - so much for a dream bed. The comforter had 'gunk' on it. The AC unit was loud and uncontrollable. There was no room safe nor could you lock the door. The towels smelled like fried food and cigarettes. To top it all off, no hot water, that's right, no hot water. We let the water run for about 5 minutes for our showers but it remained cold - needless to say it was a quick shower. When we came back later and tried to wash our face & brush our teeth - still no hot water. Getting a good sleep was impossible as the bed was caved in the middle like a sinkhole and the loud AC unit would start up every 5 minutes and we would jump thinking someone was breaking into our room, since there was no lock on the door. We almost just left in the middle of the night around 3am but decided to stay and sleep when we got home the next day. Check out was just as checking in, mass confusion. No one offered to help with luggage, nothing. Plus, no one even asked how the stay was. I could go on and on but the point is - don't waste your money. I'm a Baltimore native and am embarrassed that anyone who stays here thinks the hotel is a reflection of Baltimore. There are better hotels than this in Baltimore that are clean, friendly and reasonable. The best part was leaving the hotel and getting to our car - would never stay here again.", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff that needs a lesson in cleaning\u201d", "Author": "Callaway99", "ReviewID": "UR5620794", "Content": "I stayed at the Baltimore Sheraton Inner Harbor for three days while attending a conference hosted at the hotel in August, 2006. Paid a special conference rate of about $160/night plus tax. The GOOD: The beds are amazingly comfortable. I can't recall if I'd heard about Sheraton's reputation for comfy beds but I wanted to buy one for my home (if it were clean ... more later). Staff was friendly, and had to be during a massive heat wave dealing with a lot of business and tourist guests who were spending a lot of time in the the hotel, rather than venture out to the nearby Inner Harbor or Camden Yards attractions. The location to the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards can't be beat. My room had all the amenities I needed, but the cable TV channels were very limited to about 8 very basic channels. Wireless Internet cost $10 a day but the speed was good so I didn't mind paying. I didn't use the pool, but I used the gym every day and it was staffed by a very attentive gentleman who changed the TV channel and provided clean towels. The BAD: My room was dirty and smelled like a combination of stale beer and cigar smoke. And, yes, it was a non-smoking room. There were big dust bunnies behind the and on the sides of the beds, around the tables, in the closet. Everytime the A/C came on, dust billowed out. I ended up taking a towel and wiping the grime off the vent slats myself. The smell was so bad, it kept me up at night. On Day 2 when the maids came in, they actually left me a half-used toilet paper roll on the bathroom counter. Nice! It looked like they ran the vacuum once down the center of the room and left. I even left a very big tip as encouragement each day, to no avail. They did manage to change the sheets and give me new towels. I was tempted to ask for another room, but the problem seemed to be systemic.", "Date": "August 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't go back\u201d", "Author": "VirginiaFamilyof4", "ReviewID": "UR5457371", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel on July 4th for fireworks.

Also, the Inner Harbor though great during the day, got really scary at night. We sat with 6 police officers for the fireworks, but still didn't really feel safe. There was a huge fight immediately following the fireworks at the harbor. I'm not sure if this is typical of the area or not, but we will not go back. The hotel itself is OK, but I didn't think it was at all worth what we paid. The one poor guy who was trying to work the desk at check-in, was also the primary person answering phones, and although he was very polite and tried to be helpful, there is only so much one person can do. Also, there was a trash can in the parking deck area, that was not emptied for 2 days and smelled horrible.

We were assured we had a Harbor View room when we confirmed our reservation the day before we checked in. Upon arrival we waited on a long line to check in and once we were finally at the desk we noticed problem # 1, the clerk at the desk was very dry, he seemed half dead. We told him we rec'd a ticket to park in the hotel garage, he advised us parking will be $20 per day whether we move the car or not, problem # 2. This was rather upsetting since we were already spending over $500 for a 2 night stay. We get to our room pull back the curtain, and proceeded to climb over the chair and table w/lamp to get a distorted view of the Inner Harbor. Please note we had an awesome view of the Hyatt's pool and tennis court, meanwhile we paid for a harbor view. We went back downstairs to speak to the clerk that checked us in to request our room to be changed. He told us they were booked and for us to call the front desk in the morning to see if \"a better room\" becomes available. My husband told him we paid for a harbor view and wanted to speak with the manager. The manager promptly addressed us and took us to see a room that had a \"better view of the harbor\" but the room had a queen size fold out bed that was very low to the ground, that would have been perfect for a teenager. We expressed to her how displeased we were and although she was nice and apologized she didn't offer to take anything off of the bill. We left the Sheraton and walked across the street to the Hyatt to check availability, since it was the July 4th holiday weekend they were completely booked. Upon returning to the Sheraton we noticed the night shift had just clocked in so we went back to the front desk and expressed how unhappy we were and how we were assured we would receive a harbor view room when we made the reservations and confirmed and paid extra $$ for it but instead we paid extra money to see the Hyatt's pool and tennis court. The clerk was very understanding and gave us a credit of almost $50, which just about covered parking.

Concierge and front desk clerk were pleasant/helpful. We parked cars in the hotel's parking area and took them out as needed, $20 each. That worked fine. But there was a disagreeable odor about everything, stale cigarette smoke and perhaps too much deodorant sprinkled around to kill the smell. This was despite the fact that we stayed in two \"non-smoking\" rooms. There were gurgling noises from the plumbing when others used it and funny noises from the heating/air conditioning vent as well. We had a nice view and the beds were fine. Four elevators located together--but one of them had a problem of arriving and then refusing to take you further;the other three would not come until the faulty one had been activated. The internet blurb promised a frigo-bar in every room and in the two rooms where we stayed there were none. It looked like it HAD existed beneath the TV but had been removed. Also there was the promise of complimentary water, which indeed we received but not without asking for it twice. Breakfast in our rooms was slow in coming. It was, admittedly, a Monday morning and that may have had something to do with a feeling that the staff hadn't totally come awake by 7 AM. We had appointments to get to, so it was a little antsy waiting to see when breakfast would come. Portions were enormous and over-priced.

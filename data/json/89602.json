Although the hotel is often very busy as it is a large conference hotel, it does not diminsh the service and courtesy of the staff. My husband and I have stayed at this hotel before and have enjoyed it on both occasions, I have also stayed previously with my sister. Although I understand that it may not suit everyone as it is so large we have found it to be a very good hotel. Although my last visit was three years ago, Jason on reception remembered me and greeted me warmly. Our room was on the 16th floor and had great views. The two large beds in the room were extremely comfortable and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. It was equipped with Tv, toiletries, an iron, hairdryer etc.The breakfast served in the hotel is a bit pricey but well worth it as you can choose from freshly made omelettes and eggs,pastries, fruit salads, meats and sausages and in fairness after one of these breakfasts you don't have to eat until late evening, so you can carry on sightseeing. The hotel has a friendly bar and restaurant and also a Starbucks, where as an alternative to breakfast you can buy coffee and pastries to eat in or take to your room. In the very large lobby there are bowls of apples ,lovely flowers and plenty of seating. There are plenty of PCs and free internet access for hotel guests. There is also a gift shop which also stocks essential such as toiletries, reading glasses,travel guides etc. The hotel is attached on the second floor to the Prudential tower and shopping mall, so if the weather is inclement you can go out shopping without ever going outside. Apart from shopping,the hotel is located in a great area.Outside is one of the stops for the Old town trolley bus, a guided tour with a hop on hop off facility.It is also within walking distance of Trinity church, Boston Public gardens and Common and the State house. We walked the whole of the Freedom trail starting from our hotel and making our way through the common and following the clearly marked trail through historic areas of Boston. Harvard and JFK museum and library are short train journies away. Don't forget to ask the concierge about train journies.theatre tickets ,restaurant reservations etc. They could not have been more helpful. A good tip for theatre tickets is to go on the day to BOSTIX in Copley square or near Faneuil hall to get discounted tickets. Quincy market is a great place to sample worldwide food and cheaply. We also visited Concorde, to see Louisa May Alcotts house(Little women) and also Salem to the museum about witchcraft.(trains go to both destinations from North station). Boston has a lot to offer and should not be overlooked, unwind in one of the many Irish bars or an upmarket restaurant or after a busy day visiting all the museums, shops and sights relax with a cocktail or a pint of Guinness at The Cup in Hand the oldest pub in America (apparently), before going back to the Sheraton for a night cap,then sink into a big comfortable bed , before starting all over again the next day.(Oh by the way if you eat too much, the Sheraton has a gym and a pool too). enjoy!", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "T_R_Grant", "ReviewID": "UR125200227", "Content": "I stayed at the Sheraton while in Boston for work for several days and had an enjoyable stay.

(2)is definitely a corporate hotel - would be more appropriate for a business person (3) I was allowed to check in an hour early when I mentioned to the receptionist that I was unwell and she offered to have tea sent to the room and assured me that there was availabilty for the next night if I was unable to fly home the next day. Negatives!!! I could have essentially died in that room and no-one would have known. No tea arrived (although I was so sick I didn't really care) and no-one called to see if I was okay - it is of course possible that I was expecting too much, especially from such a large hotel but maybe some concern if a guest, checking in on her own, mentions she is unwell and breaks down in tears in front of you at check in??? I was suffering from acute vertigo and became so unwell that after several hours of trying, managed to bundle myself into a cab and go to AE at Brigham and Womens Hospital - three hours in AE, $3000 bill but life savers. I eventually woke up at 11 the next morning, marginally better but still not well. Having spent 30 mins trying to get through to the front desk, I ordered room service and mentioned to the lady on the phone that I couldn't check out straightaway. She informed me that the hotel was full (thankfully I was able to fly that day) and said I could stay in the room for another 4 hours at a cost of $100. I was so desperate that I of course paid the money to stay in the room. I eventually left the hotel at 4 o'clock and flew home that evening. The Sheraton is a large, corporate hotel and it is possible that a smaller hotel would have offered a more personal service.The staff are polite but I would be hard pushed to say they have any genuine interest in their customers - noone seemed interested in \" doing that little bit extra\" to make the stay more pleasurable.

A refrigerator would have been really nice, since there is a supermarket within walking distance. - Wifi in the room is $13/day.

This was our 3rd time staying in the Sheraton and choose it simply because the location, right in the heart of Boston, connected to the Prudential centre, a block from Newbury Street and Boylston Street right on your door step .

It is convenient to shopping and it is easy to navigate around the city from the hotel. However, I want to report my less than acceptable service when I stayed recently. I had trouble checking in to start. They could not locate my reservation, even when I gave the front desk my confirmation number. After several calls, they figured out what the problem was and allowed me to check in. After checking in, I went to my room only to find that they had placed me in a room with one bedroom after I had clearly paid for a double. I had to go back down with my belongings and have them assign me a different room. The woman at the desk was quite rude but saw that I was correct and gave me a different room. I was pretty irritated at this point and do not understand why I was treated that way after the front desk had made several mistakes. The room was quite tight, and I also found a dirty knee high in the bottom of my bed. Not wanting to deal with the poor service at the front desk, I ignored it. I also noticed that the walls were paper thin and I could clearly hear my neighbor watching tv. Lastly, the desk charged my card 2x for the incidental hold they issue. I would never stay at this hotel again until they had an overhaul with the front office staff. And maybe cleaned the rooms better. Also, is it too much to ask to check in with no problems and be charged the correct amount?!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA solid performer in all categories\u201d", "Author": "Chgo_Biz_Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121733676", "Content": "I've stayed here many times over the past two years and wanted to update my review of 2 years ago.

My understanding is that Plats frequently are upgraded at this hotel. They also have a great health club that was recently renovated, with a locker room and a sauna, and an 18-yard lap pool which is nice but kind of warm for swimming and also somewhat overchlorinated. On my recent stay, the club level was closed due to \"low occupancy\" which was kind of annoying, but they gave club floor guests a free buffet breakfast so that really made up for it, since I don't usually use the club in the evening. I should note also that I have stayed at the Westin Copley Place, and although it has fancier and more luxurious decor, I think that in all other respects the Sheraton is just as good, and is usually cheaper.

Location of the room, nice. Good view of Boylston rd, The famous \"club room' had music AND TV( on CNN only) on 24/7 clashing with each other, ( very annoying)and they only served a breakfast of a few muffins chewy croissants and chunks of melon or strawberries, yogurt choice was Dannon fat free only one flavor: strawberry unimpressive granola. Coffee was the usual starbucks, and there was literally litte else. They had ONE computer ( always taken) and the tables wesere such that you were perched like a parrot on a stool, instead of comfortably sitting at normal level, or there were 2 windows-facing narrow tables for people who liked to look at the Charles river and MIT ( also always occupied at peak breakfast time). The rest of the day ( after 10 am)there was no tea, no refreshemnts NOTHING except a few bottles of water and some granola candy bars. That was the big whoop of being on a club level. The room was absolutely identical to the lower cost ones, and the bathroom so small that if you took a deep breat you would run out of oxygen! No robe, miniscule towels, no fridge ( what happened to those? Why hotels decided to do away with in room refrigerators?), same toiletries atht would leave your skin dry and your hair flying.

I guess I should be happy I did not bring home bed bugs , but for over 500 bucks/night I expected much more: at the very last snacks in the club room, more confy bathrooms, a robe in the room and a decent size towel to dry myself off... and nicer bathroom amenieties would not hurt...

We were two Australian couples who had booked two rooms and arriving for 3 nights on two different bookings - first booking was originally for 25&26 September and then we added another booking of 24 September. We initially had decided to arrive in Boston on 25 September which was my husband's and my anniversary but decided to arrive a day early which happened to be my birthday. I contacted Sheraton via email and asked them to link the two bookings together so that neither our friends nor my husband and I would have to move rooms after the first night. No problem at all they said via a beautiful email! When we arrived the rest of my party were busy emptying out our hire car so I approached the desk to check us all in as the bookings for both rooms were in my name. I was sooooo impressed with the standard of the hotel and the check in process. Due to the fact that I had already 'let on' that it was our anniversary we had been upgraded to a fabulous suite. I also produced my passport (unasked for) which indicated it was my birthday too so that we could have a laugh over it! I certainly didn't expect anything to come of it considering my husband and I had already been kindly given an upgrade. I then enquired whether there was another suite available for my friends to also experience an upgrade (cheeky, I know) and the fabulous check-in attendant said he could accommodate my friends as well and that just made my day! When we went into our rooms it far exceeded our expectations. Our room had spectacular views that could be seen through two wrap-around walls of windows. It also had a great separate sitting area also with a wall of windows to view the skyscrape. I was in love with it! Our friends also had a huge room where the sitting area and the bedroom were altogether which made the room HUGE - they were also in love with theirs. :) But wait, there's more! Our friends had arrived at our suite in order to leave for my birthday dinner when there was a knock at the door. My husband opened it and was greeted by an impeccably dressed waiter carrying a beautiful silver tray. On it was an exceptional bottle of french champagne and massive chocolate coated strawberries. How great is this! The note that accompanied it welcomed us, wished me a great birthday and hoped we would enjoy our stay at the Sheraton in Boston. Signed from Peter. I was on cloud nine. My apologies, Peter, but I somehow misplaced your gorgeous card along the way back to Australia (as happens when travelling for months although ironically I still have the label souvenired from the bottle of the champers - go figure!). I'm relatively sure it said you were the Manager of the Front Reception. I meant to come and thank you before I checked out but time got away from us and that didn't end up being possible. So sorry :( Please accept this Tripadvisor review as being formal and proper acknowledgement for a job exceptionally well done. The bed was to die for, the view was out of this world, breakfasts are mouth watering, the position is terrific for getting around Boston, the staff are second to none, the upgrade was very appreciated and the champagne and strawberries were just the icing on the cake. It all just made our stay in Boston one that none of us will ever forget. Thank you to everyone at Sheraton Boston for making our trip to Boston so memorable. Needless to say we love Boston (Sheraton had a large part in that) and we will return again at some stage in the future.

What I didn't like about the room was there were not enough electrical outlets! I use a CPAP machine, we have a computer, we like to have space to recharge our cellphones and it would be nice not to have to hunt for an outlet to do these things. I wanted a refrigerator in the room for my insulin, and it was provided free of charge, but that took up outlet space. The shower was really bad--not enough pressure so I had to fill the tub and take a bath each morning. I prefer a hand held spray shower head, so for me this was a problem.

It looks recently renovated, lobby as well as rooms and public spaces, and our room was lovely, with a large comfortable bed, table, chair, armchair, and bench. As others have mentioned, the hotel connects to a large mall (Prudential Center), and there are two subway (T) stations a short walk away. It's a very large hotel (two towers, each with 30 floors), and houses a convention center, so it's quite busy and the lobby sees heavy traffic all day. Our room was very quiet though. The staff were friendly and efficient. After checking in, we noticed the A/C in our room wasn't cooling properly. We notified the desk before leaving to see the city and have dinner, and the clerk immediately apologized and said they'll fix it. Upon our return, it was indeed working properly; it was also very quiet, as part of a central system. Two downsides - first, the lack of breakfast (you can pay for it separately, but it's overpriced). That's not too bad - there's a Starbucks right in the lobby, and we just got some coffee and food there. There's also the whole mall, so you won't go hungry. Second - internet costs $9.95 a day - a steep, unjustified price. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby, along with a few computers for your use. We got a good rate with Hotwire, around $120 a night (and still got a nice room on a high floor), and were pleased with the hotel.

In fact, I heard every move she made - the next morning she ordered breakfast. I heard her call, place the order, and I heard the clinking of her silverware as she ate. I have a hard time understanding why a hotel wouldn't have more consideration about the ability of their doors to block sound. They doors may as well have been made of tissue paper.

Honestly, the rooms are so small and the property so depressing, I can't imagine making the decision to stay here with the Marriott and the Westin right across the street.

We booked this hotel (with the help from the wonderful folk of the Trip Advisor Boston forum!) on Hotwire for the amazing price of $112 per night (guaranteed king bed). It is described on Hotwire as the 3 and a half star in Back Bay/Copley area with a pool. It was well worth taking the risk as the price on the Sheratons website was $249 per night. We arrived at about 4.30 pm on the Saturday of Labor Day, there was quite a sizeable queue for check in, as it was induction weekend for a lot of the Boston area colleges and the line seemed to progress very slowly. When we finally got to check in about 30 minutes later, we were told that our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready and to check back again in 45 minutes. I thought it was quite ridiculous that the rooms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready at 5pm, we were tired after a long flight and just wanted to get showered and changed, but we had a drink at the bar and sure enough, our room was ready at 6.00. I had emailed ahead and asked for a renovated room with a view if possible. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect our request to be granted as we had paid such a low rate, but sure enough, we were given a renovated room in the North Tower on the 23rd floor with a huge picture window and a lovely view over the city. So well worth sending a quick email request! The room itself was nice; comfortable, clean and sleekly decorated very much like any other Sheraton I have been in. The room was nice and spacious, and because our room was disabled access, our bathroom was huge also. The prints of Boston landmarks on the wall were a nice touch. The storage space would be lacking for a longer stay, but it suited us fine as we were only there for 3 nights. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room and bathroom were very well lighted (a bugbear of mine is dark bathrooms in modern hotels). The room and bathroom were spotless and the housekeeping service was good. The Starbucks coffee and coffee maker was a nice touch, we used it every morning, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adequate creamer left for two people, I kept having to squirrel away tubs of half and half in restaurants! There were a few problems though; the room had a large TV, yet the TV picture was the worst I have ever seen! It was impossible to watch anything with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsnow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on screen. I would expect a hotel like the Sheraton to have perfect TV reception. The shower was big and had great water pressure, yet it made an unbelievable noise. If one was in bed while the other was in the shower, it made a noise like a drill been drilled into the wall. The air conditioning was awkwardly placed; it was facing away from the bed, so it was hard to feel the benefit of the cool air when lying in bed at night. The hotel has a swimming pool and gym. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the gym and only used the pool once, it was pretty underwhelming to be honest, nothing to write home about and is quite small. But nonetheless, it was a nice amenity to have. The sauna was not hot enough As previously mentioned, the hotel offers free wi-fi in the lobby, yet charges to use in the room. I find it staggering that a hotel, aimed at business convention delegates, would charge to use wi-fi in the room in this day and age. The hotel is in a great location, it is connected to the Prudential Centre, which has a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 subway stop. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great not having to go outside to catch a subway, especially if it is very hot or raining as it was on our last day. There are lots of great restaurants on nearby Boylston Street and Copley Square is a pleasant 5 minute walk away. Boston is a great walking city and we were able to walk to Boston Common in 15 minutes or some of the historic sites in 30 minutes. We only really used the T to get to the North End and the USS Constitution. I would stay here again if the price was right; it is a nice hotel, just not worth the price they charge on their own website. It is too large and impersonal for me, if I was spending $249 per night on a hotel, I would prefer to stay in a more personal, boutique style establishment. Also, if I were returning, it would be my preference to stay in the Fanueil Hall area or North End area, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a personal preference. The Sheraton is a great choice if you get it at the right price, do check Hotwire, it is a huge hotel and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always fill their rooms so it is regularly available on Hotwire at a massive discount.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Sheraton & visiting Boston\u201d", "Author": "lettylake", "ReviewID": "UR118578511", "Content": "The Sheraton was wonderful, best thing was the location, right near the Tube with access to everywhere.

The hotel was perfectly located as it is an easy walk to the Hynes Convention Center and the Prudential Center as well as within walking distance to Fenway. I was given a handicapped accessible room even though it was not requested nor needed. And after staying in the room, I am not so sure that if I was wheelchair bound, it would have been accessible. The room is visually appealling but a little cramped. The closet in the room was very small and I could barely fit my carry-on suitcase into it. The top shelf inside the closet might have had a 6 in clearance. But at least they had very nice wooden hangers. The chair in the room faced the bed and had to be pulled out in order to watch tv. The bathroom was very spacious and quite attractive with wooden shelves and a granite counter top. The toilet was right next to the counter and the toilet paper roll was located on the wall so that one had to twist completely around to reach it. I nearly threw my back out and ended up using the spare roll that was on the counter. The only towel bar in the bath is located at the end of the bathtub about 6-8 feet away from the counter and the towels are located under the counter. Having forgotten to grab a towel BEFORE I jumped into the shower that counter might as well been down the hall. The lighting in the bathroom is poor, especially if you are trying to put on make-up with eyes that don't see as well as they once did. The mirror on the counter was rather interesting in that it could swivle in any direction, but without a lightsource it was useless. Since this was a handicap accessible room the controls for the shower were at the opposite end of the tub from the faucet. But if someone under 5'-7\" needs to adjust the showerhead (which is the sunflower style) good luck in reaching it. This particular hotel has taken on a new meaning when it comes to conservation. Nearly every other hotel I have stayed in offers the option to forego changing the linens/towels on a daily basis. I am fine with that. This hotel takes it a step further.... no service at all!! For a $5 dollar voucher to their restuarants (which includes a Starbucks), not only did they not change the sheets/towels, they did not make the bed or even bother to empty the trash.

So then I was told that we could move to the other tower for only one night because that tower was going to be shut down for maintenance and I was going to get another room the next day and a one night credit. So we had to move to the other tower and it was fine and the room was in fact bigger.

Stayed in a corner room on the 18th Floor of the South Tower. Living area is large and comfortable, but the bathroom is so small you'd think they designed it for little children...barely enough room to breathe in there. Excellent city views from two different windows, since it was a corner room. Everything looked good until we started to settle down for the evening. The showerhead was so corroded from long use that water pressure was nearly non-existent. Even worse, there was hair on the bathroom ceiling and the shower walls...and I don't mean a few...I stopped counting after 7. Also, paint is peeling off the ceiling in the shower, there are large stained cracks in the sink, and there were 3 inches of old water still in the ice bucket from some previous occupant. Stopped by the Front Desk on our way out to dinner to point out these problems and requested they be corrected while we were out. When we returned, Housekeeping had made an attempt to clean the hair off the bathroom ceiling and walls and Maintenance had replaced the showerhead, but they left a huge 13\" x 17\" puddle of water right in the middle of the bathroom floor. The ice bucket had not been emptied. I took care of the puddle and the ice bucket myself, then used cleaned towels to wipe down the bathroom ceiling and walls. If this were a Motel 8, I would expect these things, but for $230 a night at a downtown Boston hotel owned by Sheraton, I was very disappointed.

The room was standard, small but clean and the linens were very nice. Pillows were not firm enough for us. The pool was large and my kids really liked it. The hotel wanted $89 a night to park our car with a roof top carrier. We ended up parking it across the street for $30 a night. Service was mostly great but with one bad incident that left a permanent bad taste in our mouths. When we arrived, the car port was absolutely swarming with cars and people. There was nobody to help us with our luggage. My husband was checking in so I hauled all of our luggage out of the car and proceeded to lug it all inside with the help of my kids. We managed to get all of our belongings into the lobby and again looked around for a porter. There were none to be found and my husband had to go move the car. I finally located a luggage cart and loaded up. I made it to the elevator when a porter/valet (approx. 50 - 60 years old) ran up to me and grabbed the cart and told me that he would take it up to my floor for me. I said no thank you as I had managed this far with no help and would return it after I was done. He became very angry (talking through gritted teeth) and told me that I was not allowed to take it up and that it was LAW at the Sheraton \"since 1965\" that guests were not allowed to take luggage carts. I informed him that I often took my own luggage to my room with a cart to which he responded by shoving hard the luggage cart toward me and hissing \"take it\" and then stormed away. I was mortified and my kids were horrified. I was really upset that he tried to intimidate me, especially in front of my children. As furious as we were, we never did get to speak to the manager about this as we had to be somewhere asap and again the next day. Because of this incident I will not be staying here anytime soon.

Its about a mile walk to the park which is great for a younger crowd to get a chance to see some of Boston's back bay area. The hotel itself was nice, the rooms though small were clean and the beds comfortable. The room had a nice view of the older section of the city. One very positive note is that it is connected to a strip mall which includes restaurants such as Legal Seafood which is a very good choice and also PF Changs, among others. Also there were many shops included. The staff was friendly and check in was average. A good choice it seems for business meetings and lectures. There were many pubs and clubs along the way including McGreevys which is the oldest sports bar in the USA. A must stop for baseball fans as it included a lot of memorabilia of the Red Sox and the old Boston Braves. In conclusion, I felt it was a nice hotel.

Dogs are welcomed here at this hotel which was not clearly indicated on their website when we were looking to book. Which we were happy about, we have a 15pound malti-poo who is very well behaved and doesn't bark. The lovely lady who would clean our room would take the time to pet him the one time we left him behind. Traveling with the dog posed somewhat of a challenge. Since my parents have never been to Boston we decided to do one of their trolley bus tours, hop on hop off. The only one that allowed us to bring the dog with us (\"for medical reasons\") was the trolley bus green and yellow. That is the best one anyway, it is the only trolley that goes to Harvard University. The Science Museum I recommend if you have children, it is interactive and lots of fun. I love walking down Newburry Street. Although, according to the trolley bus tour guys there's cheaper shopping else where ! We ate at Cheers, (it was one of my dad's favorite shows) At first we thought tourist trap, but we really enjoyed it, and the food was actually quite good. My mom and I had a 'coaches' drink, lots of rum and very yummy! for a couple of extra bucks we got to keep the glass! I enjoyed walking through Harvard, I have been to Boston many, many times and this was the first time that I actually got to see Harvard. Boston is one of those cities you just walk and enjoy. It is clean, surrounded by big trees, the people are nice (even when they found out I'm a Habs fan, which I made sure they new after they served my food!!) It's wonderful city to visit.

Staff obviously spent very little time looking after it as there were filthy marks around the edge of the pool and swimming around you would find clumps of hair floating around and I dread to think what the other suspicious looking objects were. The gym was actually really great, just not in the best place, you have to walk through the pool area to get to the second fitness room - I witnessed many poor people slipping over! The worst experience I had regarding the facilities was the fact that during my stay they decided to close off the pool deck to us paying customers for a private event.

Indeed, it was only after getting home a week later that we learned that there were some very basic things concerning diet, etc. that would have made her feel much more comfortable - none of which he mentioned.

We were on the eleventh floor of the south tower and could literally (literally) hear every single \"T\" train that passed on the red line through the Prudential stop beneath the ground. My wife had me think of it as \"big ocean waves\" which did help, but come on. At rush hour times you will hear it. Since this starts at about 7:30 to 8:30 in the morning and 4:30 to 6:00 in the evenings, you need to know this will affect you too. I did ask someone staying on the 26th floor (and in the North tower) who said he didn't hear the trains. Since I travel with a fan, I was able to drown out some (but not all) the noise. In the Blues Brothers movie, when Elwood brings his brother Jake home from Joliet prison and to his studio apartment located directly next to the El line in Chicago, Jake asks Elwood \"how often does the train go by?\" to which Elwood responds, \"so often you won't even hear it\". Well, at the Sheraton Boston you will hear the trains. It wasn't as clean as we had expected it to be. I'm not holding it against them too much though. When there are a thousand rooms in one hotel, it isn't going to be the Four Seasons. It is in a great location for tourists indeed. That alone (really!) is enough to stay here/Marriott.

This hotel is conveniently located and connected to the Prudential Shopping Center from the 2nd floor. The shopping center had a decent food court for quick bites to eat, lots of shopping options and a Barnes & Noble bookstore. The Duck Tours leave from the opposite end of the shopping center from the Sheraton which was perfect and well worth the tour. The hotel is a block away from Newbury Street which was great for shopping and casual eateries and people watching too. I noticed that the Old Town Trolley Tours pick up in front of the resort too. There were pedi-cabs outside the hotel lobby. Pedi-cabs are like cabs but on bikes, they can get through traffic through back alleys while you sit and enjoy the ride from a seat in the cart they tow. This was perfect to get to Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. Cost, you pay what you like. They offered a buffet breakfast at Apropos which was conveniently located next to Starbucks in the lobby. I frequented the buffet every morning and it was quick and convenient. Room Service food quality was surprisingly good. The sliders were yummy and perfect for a midnight snack. Computers were available with complimentary internet access in the main lobby. While the timer was annoying (they limit you to 45 minutes), it was understandable since I was surrounded by teenagers. The room was small and the view was much to be desired but that's expected for a city hotel. When I say small I mean small (almost clostraphobic). There was just enough room for one person to be in one area of the room at a time. It was difficult for two of us to get ready at the same time. This just means that you shouldn't stay here if you plan to stay in the hotel room all day. Boston is a great city, get out and explore. The fitness facility was small but decent. If you want excercise, walk the Freedom Trail. By the way the Duck Tour covers about 85% of the Freedom Trail so on a hot humid day jump on a Duck. I loved my sleeping experience. The bed was comfortable, I got a better sleep after asking for extra pillows. Service was as expected from a city hotel, there only when you ask. They did not always meet my expectations but I admit my expectations are high. I was annoyed after noticing that they would take my wet towels but forget to replace them with clean fresh ones for two days. (Maybe I should've tipped more than $5 /day) I noticed that our neighbors Room Service table was left in the hall for nearly 10 hours (it was there when I left for breakfast and still there when I returned to get ready for dinner). Surprisingly for an older hotel with thin walls, I didn't hear much from the neighbors. I did hear the water flow from the other rooms though.

Our son said the pullout bed was very comfortable, better than a sofa bed! Also, even if you don't have time to swim, check out the pool on the 5th floor with the retractable roof, great for an evening swim under the stars!!!

We went to almost every desitination by foot, and for those destinations that were a bit farther away (such as Harvard square), we took the underground train from the station which is connected to the mall. We even went to New York City using the train that leaves from Back Bay Station (which is connected to Copley mall). So all in all this hotel was the ultimate in convenience and comfort. The hotel gym and swimming pool were amazing and recently refurbished. Lots of machines overlooking a great view and a glass roof covering the swimming pool makes you feel like you are outdoors. I also forgot to mention that there is a starbucks in the lobby and a very convenient and well designed computer stations in the lobby which allow hotel guests to browse the web for free. My kids and I made use of these computers almost daily. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay at it again.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "beaconsfield", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "twetnall", "ReviewID": "UR115420514", "Content": "We booked an club executive suite.

If you happened to be on the 28th or 29th floor then there was a dedicated express lift. Breakfast was ok, usual bagel, breads, yoghurt, pastries, fruit. Not big selection of teas and often found the coffee cold. We have used Sheratons club floors before and we're disappointed to find this was the only time they provided food, there where snack bars there and some soft drinks in the fridge but no, evening drinks or snacks.

You're surrounded by fantastic shops and eateries (Prudential Center or Newbury St). It's also connected to the T via the Prudential Center, which can get you to any place you'd like to visit including the airport for just $2 a ride. Fenway and the Museum of Fine Arts is about 15 minute walk. Boston Commons and Historic Downtown are another 15 minute walk in the opposite direction. You can even get to the Sam Adam's Brewery via the Orange line within 25 minutes. The hotel itself is very well maintained and updated. There is free wifi and computers in the lobby. You can only use the computer for 45 minutes a day before they begin charging. But that's plenty of time to get things done if you're just a tourist. The pool and gym are spotless. I was very surprised at the amount of exercise equipment they had - they too were using the latest and greatest technologies (multilingual). My husband and I used the gym several times on our trip. The only draw back is they have no free weights, but you can do sit-ups and push-ups for that. The room itself was spacious. The bed was comfy. The TV channels are limited to news and sports, but that's not a real big issue since we didn't spend much time watching TV. My only complaint about the room is that the hot water pipes \"whine\". So, if you have someone above you that likes to take showers at 6:00am, you may be awakened by the whining pipes. Thankfully, it's not too loud, so you eventually get used to it and fall back asleep. More specifically, we were in the North Tower, on the 6th floor right next to the elevators. The elevators weren't an issue. However, the baseball fans coming in late at night, slamming doors and yelling about the ice machine were an issue. Thankfully, they only stayed one night. You can't help who your neighbors are, I guess. But, you can help if you're near the ice machine. If I were you, I'd request not being near the elevators/ice machine and you may be able to reduce the 'ambient' noise. My favorite thing about the room is the ability to choose the \"green\" option. You put a tag on your door that tells the Maids you don't need new towels or sheets every day. I like my privacy and am not a big fan of people going through my room while I'm not there. Add that to saving some enegery and water, it's a win win. The best part is that every day you use the 'green' option, Sheraton slips a $5 gift certificate under your door to be used for drinks or concessions at any of their restaurants. If you stay there for a few nights and save up, you can get yourself a free breakfast buffet. All in all, I would suggest staying at this hotel. We slept well. We were perfectly situated to everything we wanted to see. The front desk personnel were helpful. And the free wifi made it easy to download Boston Apps to my iPod. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

Before our arrival, I confirmed several requests with two separate Sheraton Boston employees. Not surprisingly, none of my requests were in the hotel's computer system when we arrived. So after having travelled with my family for over five hours to get to this hotel, we had to basically fight for the things to which we were already entitled (and which I'd specifically confirmed so that this very thing would not happen). For example, as a Preferred Plus Business member I am always entitled to complimentary club lounge benefits and late checkout. However, I had to show the naysayers at the front desk the e-mails that I was sent confirming these very amenities. Check-in should be easy and quick, not a fight to get the very things to which I'm already entitled. And to top it off, nobody at the front desk believed anything I said until I actually produced the e-mails sent to me by Sheraton Boston employees in which they wrote that I was, in fact, entitled to these things on a complimentary basis. And when we received our bill at the end of our stay, we saw that we were grossly overcharged. Not only that, but we were actually billed for several complimentary full breakfasts that we had been granted (in the lobby restaurant). And they had the audacity to even give themselves a tip! (We were charged $44 for one full breakfast, which was supposed to be free, and then $51 for another full breakfast, which was also supposed to be free and which obviously added itself a nice $7 tip). Absolutely unacceptable. Oh, and when we got home, we noticed that we were overcharged for one of the other nights that we stayed there. I called to get that fixed and was told I'd get a credit on my statement. I'll see if that actually happens...I'm wondering if they just overcharge everyone in the hopes that nobody will notice.

I would hear people talking outside in the hallway (luckily this didn't happen at night when I was trying to fall asleep), and also the shower running in other adjacent rooms. -Common areas...some areas could use some renos. -Big groups of what looked like high school kids sitting in the lobby all the time.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davis, California", "Title": "\u201cIt ended up being a huge disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Holnek", "ReviewID": "UR112055017", "Content": "I would've given 4 stars for this property, but my trip was ruined immediately after checking out at the front desk. Before going into that, a few things that I've liked about the Sheraton: - Great front desk staff - very attentive, knowledgeable, nice, courteous, and fast - lobby - great lobby with computers/internet, sitting areas, starbucks, games, etc. - rooms are consistent with what you would find at any other descent Sheraton - clean and recently renovated - location - if you've done some research, you already know that you can't go wrong by staying here. Other comparable choices would be Westin, Marriott, or the Hilton (however, for Hilton, you will have to cross the road to get into Prudential). Now, to the bad things and why this property can only get a 2 star, if not worse. - The bell desk is horrible. We were in line for about 15 min to check our luggage at the Bell desk since we had a few hours to kill. You can tell that they are pretty slow if we had to wait for 15 min already. In any case, there were many people behind us in line. Two bellmen were there. However, they dismissed our request to check our bags and told us to ask someone else to help us...wtf...they are the only ones there! To make things worse, they would go to those behind us and pick up bags for them...Very rude Bell Desk staff, and I was very offended by their attitude and behavior. People behind us even asked the Bell desk to help us since we were ahead in line, but since they were anxious to get tip, they wanted to pick up bags as opposed to check them in. Anyway, we ended up waiting for about 30-40 min...terrible. Some other cons about this property - rooms: although the rooms appear to be recently renovated, you can tell that the property is slightly dated by some of the details - need more front desk staff - while each staff is relatively quick, they cannot seem to handle the volume of people staying at the property - Internet is $9.95 for 24 h (not necessarily a bad thing, but just FYI) - No lobby convenient store - need to walk to Hilton or Walgreens - Rooms are quite small, particularly if you have a King bed room. Our party also had a two double bed room, and the room is considerably nicer/bigger. - Water pressure is so so.

Although we have stayed in both of these hotels numerous times, we stayed at both of them during this past trip to Boston - We were at the Sheraton Boston for 5 nights and the Commander for 2 nights. Locations- The Sheraton Boston is attached to the shops and restaurants of the Prudential building, has 3 T stops within a short walk, is near Berkelee School of Music and very close to Boylston and Newberry Streets. It has easy entrance onto the freeway. The Sheraton Commander is in Cambridge near Harvard and has all of the charm of the shops and restaurants of Cambridge. The T stop is a 10 minute walk. Entry on and off the freeway is a little more difficult, but possible. Rooms - The Sheraton Boston has views and is multi-story with quick elevators and modern rooms. It is huge and a typical conference center hotel. The toiletries in the room are minimal. The corner suites are very spacious and modern. Rooms are similar. The Sheraton Commander is in a character filled older building, but is completely remodeled and very nice. Elevators are quirky. Toiletries are better and more plentiful. My daughter says their rollaway beds are far more comfortable as well. Air conditioning can be very noisy. No views. The rooms are spacious and very nice. I have stayed in 3 different styles (King, Double & Suite) over the years. The Suites have two bedrooms and a living room which is wonderful for families. Service - Parking at the Sheraton Boston is expensive. Service is mayhem and can be very slow. Front desk is helpful. We had to request a rollaway 4 times. Once by email. Once by phone. Once when we arrived. Once with housekeeping and 8 hours later from the front desk. The pool is nice but no attendant means towels everywhere and wild kids. The gym had a lot of kids 10-14 every morning. The bar was a total disappointment. 3 of the drinks we asked for on the cocktail list were not available. Service was sad and noone seemed to know what they were doing on the 4 times we went to the bar. The Sheraton Commander has a parking attendants next to the hotel making retrieving your car (especially for early morning flights) easy. Parking is nearly half the price of the Sheraton Boston.

This morning, I got to the hotel a bit bleary-eyed aftr my overnight flight. No room was open yet, but the desk attendant offered a key to the fitness center and recommended I come back to check in on availability. I got a workout in in the really well-equipped center, and planned to use the roomy and clean locker room shower to get ready. I thought it wouldn't hurt to check in with the desk, and surprise! My room was ready! The room is clean and the bed is great. The fixtures could use a bit of updating, but they are all in good shape. I like my nice view of Mass Ave and the Christ Scientist church complex. There's free wi-fi and a Starbucks in the lobby (paid wi-fi in the guest rooms).

Its ideal location so close to Boylston Rd and Newbury as well as shopping Malls , conferencing centre, The Prudential and train lines makes it a very popular hotel. Although there are many other 5 star hotels in the vicinity, I think the Sheraton has the best location. Rooms were comfortable and bed quality was excellent. However I found the bathroom very small and basic. Although WIFI is free in the lobby, internet access in the rooms comes with a charge. Considering that this is a business hotel, I would expect it to be free. The hotel does have a Starbucks in the lobby as well and the nearby Prudential shopping mall has an ample food court as well as many other dining options, so eating is never a problem. With limited time trying to attend as many conference sessions as possible as well as take in the sights of Boston such as Harvard, Quincy Market , Newbury and Boylston roads, as well as the Boston Common and Gardens, the train line is also well located for easy transportation.

My wife is undergoing serious problems with her vision, and we drove 4 hours from our northern Vermont home to Boston to prepare for major \"second opinion\" exams with specialists in Boston. I arranged with my SPG Platinum concierge to alert the hotel staff that we wanted to make sure nothing went wrong with our stay, that this was not a \"vacation\" for us, but that my wife and I needed to relax the day before her critical medical exams. Despite my concierge's efforts, once again the Sheraton Boston absolutely botched my stay there. Here is what I wrote to her: I am disappointed to have to report to you that the Sheraton Boston made a mess of our stay, and needlessly added stress to something I was hoping would be a relaxing day before my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious medical tests. I should have known better than to book this particular hotel, it has routinely and regularly made mistakes nearly every time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed here in recent years. (That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I avoided it for most of 2010, as a check of the various Boston-area hotels I used this past year will demonstrate). The only reason I booked it was because the location was convenient to my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appointments. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened: 1. The suite they assigned us was smaller than I had expected. Having stayed here in the past, I knew they had larger suites, especially one with a small dining table. Because my wife is visually-impaired, I wanted one of those suites so that we could eat in. 2. When I expressed my disappointment in the suite, I was told that nothing larger was available. 3. After hanging up with the front desk, I went into the bedroom and bathroom and discovered that the suite they had assigned me had not been cleaned by housekeeping. The bed was unmade, the bathroom had used towels, used soap dried in the soap dish, used water glass on the sink, and trash in the trash can that included used tissues and a tampon wrapper. 4. I asked for the manager to come to see what we had been assigned. A few minutes later, he arrived with the Housekeeping Manager. They were all very nice, and they apologized, and the manager offered me 5,000 points back, which is a nice gesture. They also quite magically found me the slightly larger suite that had the small dining table that I had been previously told was not available. 5. I thanked the manager for the points, but I told him that what I really wanted was for the hotel to do its job properly in the first place. I told him I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why this hotel makes so many mistakes whenever I stay here. I told him I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why this had to happen on this particular stay, when I had gone to the trouble of contacting my Starwood concierge (you) to arrange to make sure they understood in Boston that my visit here was not routine, and that I needed things to go smoothly. [Name of SPG Platinum concierge deleted], I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want anything else done for me, other than this: would you file some sort of incident report via whatever systems you have in place, and send me a copy of that report? Staying at this hotel was a mistake, I blame myself for thinking that this time they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get it right. At the same time, if a Platinum customer like me who has taken steps above and beyond the norm still has such a poor experience, I think that someone at the hotel should be held accountable by someone at Starwood.

Service: The service was fine overall. We where able to check in early which was nice. After our first night stay the room was not cleaned the next day for some odd reason? We didn't have anything hanging on the door and where gone the entire day. We came back thinking the beds would have been made (which in a hotel like this you would think. Ive stayed in lesser hotels and wouldn't expect as much) but nope. The room was as we left it. It was done the next day however. We noticed a worker in the lobby that was walking around. There was a tissue on the ground and instead of picking it up, he kicked it under a chair! I thought that was kind of gross. On leaving we asked for a trolley as we where in a hurry and just wanted to grab it and go, but no, they wouldn't allow that. Instead we hate to wait for them to send up a bell boy with a trolls. Very annoying when you are in a rush. Though, the bell boy was really nice. There was an emergency alarm that went off one night which was annoying bu I can't blame that on the hotel. They had it announced over the PA system and handled it the best they could. We did find a note of apology under the door in the morning. They handled that well. Rooms: The rooms where clean and comfortable. Though the room we had which was 2 double beds was small. The bathroom was the smallest Ive seen in a hotel. Two people getting ready at the same time was not possible. One major thing with the room that ruined this hotel for us was the air conditioner. It was loud and it rattled all night long. It was too warm to not have it on, but with it on it kept my partner awake most of the night. we ended up sleeping with ear plugs. Location: This is the best thing of this hotel. The location is perfect. Its attached to the Prudential shopping center which is attached to another center. You can walk most places inside. It was easy to get to the highway from there. The Trolley tours stopped right at the front door. It was perfect. Amenities: We never used the Fitness Center or Pool though I hear it is good. Over all I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good discount price on it, which is what we did so I can't really complain. Though I wouldn't recommend it otherwise as you have to pay $44 for parking a night, pay extra for internet and any other perks. I'm sure for the normal $300+ price tag a night you could find better in the area.

PROS: -Location. It is connected to the Prudential Center so you don't even need to go outside to get to the Prudential stop on the T, which was very nice on the scorching hot days I was in Boston. Walking distance to many Boston sites. I never felt unsafe. -Price. Not sure how much a room is normally, but I scored my room here for $100 a night (that's including taxes and fees) on Hotwire. AMAZING for a hotel in this location. -Cleanliness. No complaints with the cleanliness! Rooms were cleaned nicely each day. -Service. All employees I dealt with were very friendly and helpful, with the exception of one bell hop who was a little surly. -Pool and hot tub! I was in Boston for touristic purposes, so I did a lot of walking around in the strong heat, and I can honestly say that my Boston experience would not have been as good as it was without the pool to cool off in and the hot tub to relax my muscles in. Of course, as with most pools, beware of the children. CONS: -No fridge or microwave in the rooms. Shame because I had to waste some leftover food because I had nowhere to store it. So the lack of a fridge forced me to spend more money on food than I would have wanted. -Small bathroom. Not a big deal to me, but should be noted. -Shower feels like you're being pelted with rocks. Even on the lowest setting, it is PAINFUL. -Air conditioning makes clicking sound through the night. It was annoying but I just put in my ear plugs and was fine for sleeping. -I had requested two double beds months prior to my arrival, but only got a room with one king sized bed and one pull out couch. It was sufficient but it would have been nice to have had an actual bed for myself and my friend. -Internet. WiFi is $10 per night (I think) in the rooms. You have to go to the lobby for the free WiFi or to use the computers. There are only 6 computers available for the whole hotel (the hotel is HUGE, by the way) and I had to wait on average 10-15 minutes each night for one to become available.

It is well-located in downtown Boston, within walking distance of major attractions like Fenway Park, Boston Common, the Public Garden, the Freedom Trail and Newbury St. shopping.

Nice. Just a few weaknesses to this property. First, hotel parking is excessively expensive - $39 for self-parking and $44 for valet parking although these seem to be market rates for the neighbourhood. We chose instead to take our chances parking on nearby streets and plugging a meter ($1/hour from 8-8). Second, the parking garage didn't allow adequate clearance for our roof-top cargo box (another reason that we chose to park on the strreet).

Was reassigned to an executive suite with connecting Double/Double for the teens that was not on Club floor but had club access - or so I thought. Our key would not work - went back to front desk and was told I had to tell the check in person we had club access - hmmm, don't they know that??? Room was nice a big but if the bed is a Sweet Sleeper, then they have seriously gone downhill - extremely hard and not very comfortable. A/C is high on the wall near the window, works well but points directly at the other wall - not into the room - so the couch by the window is nice and cool but not the rest of the room. There is no WiFi in the rooms (paid or free) - very surprised about that considering they are a big convention hotel. PITA to use the wired internet since you have to sit at the desk. They really need to come into the 21st century! Not being on a club level was a little inconvenient since only 2 of the 6 elevators go to those floors. It usually took about 4 tries to get the right elevator. Club Lounge - again, big disappointment. Have stayed at many club level starwood hotels and have always had complimentary wine and beer - not here - they charge restaurant prices for the drinks. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary and well stocked. Food was just okay - a few hot apps, bread & cheese, veggie and dips and nuts. Breakfast was cereals, bagels, fresh fruit and yogurt. The good news is that the lounge is open 24 hours for access, sodas and water (not food) so I least I could use the free WiFi in the lounge. Service - the staff is all very nice but I always had to ask twice for things to be sent to the room. First Concierge was very helpful, the second one was very abrupt and borderline rude.

Thus, we were delighted to discover that the Sheraton Boston has bucked this trend, offering many free computers for guests to use near reception. A Starbucks is also in this area. The hotel's convenient location includes indoor walkways to the Prudential and Copley Place shops as well as the Hynes Convention Center. We walked inside the mall areas to Amtrak's Boston Back Bay Station for our morning train to New York City.

I haven't looked closely at other reviews, but I really don't understand why this hotel isn't rated higher. I can say that unless the price is just hugely different, (I think the Sheraton is actually cheaper) I would stay here over the Hilton across the street any day. (I had friends staying at the Hilton - the rooms were the same, the Hilton offered a very quickie cheap free breakfast (big deal), and other then that, the Sheraton blew it away. My thoughts: Location - can't beat it if you're looking at the Back Bay area. The hotel is attached (we had wet cold weather for 3 days) to the Convention Center, the mall (all kinds of shops and restaurants), the Prudential building (if you have business there) and the closest T station (Prudential station). Fenway Park was a 10 minute walk one direction and Boston Commons was a 15-20 minute walk the other. Lobby - the hotel's biggest asset in my opinion. Extremely big, open and updated, which served as a nice meeting / hangout area for the party I was traveling with. Plenty of lounge chairs, a Starbucks (service WAS slow there) and about 10 computers comfortably spaced out to access the free internet. I didn't partake of the bar or restaurant so \"no comment\" there, but I really don't know why anyone would eat there, as there are dozens of other choices within the block. Rooms - small but big enough. This (like probably most hotels in the area) is an older building they've done their best to update. My one complaint w/b the shower - the shower head leaked and only about half the water came out the way it should have. (The Hilton room I saw was the exact same size.) Service - Thought it was good-to-great. We asked for an extra bed and it was quickly provided. The conceirge was friendly and helpful with all \"how do I get here\" questions. We also had a slight issue with the bill, and the Sheraton immediately took care of it in our favor, which was way above and beyond what we expected.

It was obvious that the wait staff was instructed to push the breakfast buffet. My kids wanted pancakes. I ordered pancakes and was told that the buffet was $8.95 for kids, a good deal. One problem: no pancakes on the buffet. I was instructed to order pancakes through the waiter, which is what i thought I did in the first place. I was coerced into trying the buffet, big mistake. Eggs and oatmeal were cold, bacon and sausage overdone. Yogurt had separated. It was obvious that the buffet was stocked hours earlier and never refreshed. The experienced reeked of laziness.

There really is no bad spot in Boston to stay, I soon realized when booking this hotel. I didn't really know what to expect location wise but it was great for what we were looking for. We arrived around 6 in the evening and the check in was very smooth. The gentleman who checked us in was very courteous, helpful, and friendly. He was a little stiff for my liking but this is what you must expect when staying in a Sheraton/Westin. They were not hired for their personality..more so their talent and to work like a machine and spill out the same information over and over 500x's per night. The room was a junior suite and was very nice. I even discovered that the sofa pulled out to be a bed as well, when needed. The view was very nice as well looking out into Cambridge. The only real complaint on the bathroom was the 'rainfall' shower head that was installed as a regular shower head. The design is off and in doing so the pressure suffers for the decor. The next complaint comes in the way of the evening concierge team; both men. I called down to the desk from the room inquiring about a restaurant a friend of mine had suggested. The concierge was unfamiliar with Myers+Chang so he looked it up and placed me on hold. He came back on the line and stated once again that he was unaware of the restaurant but the address was 'x'. I asked him what the cross streets were and his response was 'I do not know'. What concierge doesn't know how to use the zoom tools in Google Maps? Google should be their best friend. I let it slide. On our way out of the hotel to dinner i stopped by the concierge desk again and inquired what are the cross streets of the restaurant. Different guy this time, he had heard of the restaurant but was unfamiliar of the location. He pulled out a map and said that it was on washington and then pointed on the map between a 4 block radius. Again, not able to give us a cross street. I am not sure why these two gentleman who's sole purpose is to aid and guide the guests were so unhelpful...and the tone in their voice and their attitude was completely unacceptable. We decided to walk to the restaurant. Once outside we asked the doorman which direction was Boylston street. He said that he didn't have his glasses and just stood there. Unbelievable how many rude people we ran into in just a 1.5hr time period. I hate to think ho room service and the housekeepers act!

The manager told us it was because we had booked online and that the reservation guarantee does not apply to people who book online, also that they had over booked the hotel due to short-sightedness on their part. So, we changed direction and head to the new Hotel. Once there the new hotel told us that we only had reservations for 1 room and that it begin until the next day. I explained the situation to the front desk manager, and the first thing he asked is whether Starwood was picking up the tab. I said I didn't know and that i would call to find out. The answer from the revenue manager at the Sheraton was no...I call their corporate offices...the first thing asked by the customer service person was \" Is the Sheraton paying for your room?\" After a bit of being on hold , she told me that she was going to call the Sheraton and figure out what the issues were. At this point i called Marriott (who I am a platinum member) and told them the story. they had rooms available in their Copley Marriott. as I was speaking to them, the front desk person came out to me and told me our rooms were being paid for by the Sheraton. Great i thought. NOT SO, Saturday afternoon the front desk person called me over and told me that the Sheraton had reneged on its promise and was only going to pay for the first night, not the entire weekend as was their original promise (BTW, there were actually 2 reservations- one for the first night a suite - and one for the rest of the weekend - 2 rooms..a club and regular). So here I am...another day to go, and stuck in a hotel very far away from the convention, with a son in a wheel chair. It is about $ 8.00 each way. I so HATE the Starwood Hotel chains.

We were 'tricked' by the van shuttle as he told us he was cheaper. It cost us over $32 (not including tip). Once you walk through the mall to Bolston Street, it'll take you about 15 minutes to get to Boston Commons, the start of the Freedom trail. Great walk. Really close to Fenway and lots of Irish pubs. Shopping is good: Trader Joe's within 5 minutes, Filenes Basement (I'm from the west coast so we don't have that there), etc. You really are close to everything. Rooms I'm not sure what people are talking about, but my room was really good. Not outdated, flat screen tv, great city view, very clean bathroom. I do admit that the noise barrier is a bit weak (you can hear the bathroom around you at times). But, not too bad overall.

Both a receptionist and a manager told me there was no record of my booking in their computer and seemed to expect me to just leave. After very diplomatically arguing my case (whilst wanting to scream with frustration and tiredness after a very drawn out transatlantic flight), I was eventually given a room with much reluctance and only after I'd handed over a debit card to be swiped. When it became obvious that, whatever the problem with the booking, it was not of my making, they were unapologetic. Every day (except for the weekend and New Year's Day) there was loud drilling above which made it impossible to stay in the room. This planned work was not advertised when we booked the hotel. I could actually hear it in the restrooms on the ground floor so moving room would have been pointless within that tower and we weren't offered a room in the other tower. However, that tower suffered a power cutout during our stay so I'm not sure which tower was the worse deal. The toilet in the room broke (would not stop flushing) and it took an hour and three calls from me for someone to come and fix it. The bloke was excellent and perhaps an hour's wait is not too bad but this was all happening at around 2130 and some advice on how long we would be waiting and if we would have to move room for the night would have been useful. The jacuzzi and women's changing room were in a disgusting state throughout the whole eight-night stay. The scum in the jacuzzi was tinged with grey. The changing room was thoroughly dirty with fixtures falling off the walls, horrible hair clogging up drains. The sauna and pool although not quite as disgusting as the other 'amenities' could at best be described as 'serviceable'. When I told the Sheraton about all of this at checkout the response was to clear my hotel bill which was for about 175 dollars, as an apology. Obviously I accepted this but it's pretty lame considering my friend and I spent \u00c2\u00a31500 on this trip (including flights). And the bill was outrageous in the first place. The 175 dollars was for a total of four very short international calls (probably totaling 10 minutes for all of the calls) to wish our families happy new year and a minute-long call to my friend's mobile when she was out and about in Boston. Yes, the beds were very comfortable, the shower was good and the location fantastic. However, this hotel is situated right next to every other major chain hotel in Boston so if I were you I'd advise going to one of the other ones.

This was the first time I stayed at a Sheraton and I will not stay at a Sheraton anywhere in the world at anytime. They had one chance to impress me and the hotel and front desk employees failed miserably. By the way, I spent the next night at a nearby Radisson hotel for a third of the cost of my night at the Sheraton. The rate they charge is the same every night. They had all the cable channels, and the room was much larger with a terrace and view of the city. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too hard to figure out who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get my future business. The Radisson also conducted an in depth online survey of my experience at the Radisson and their competitors in Boston including the Sheraton. This shows that the Radisson while not perfect is at least interested in honest feedback and improvement. The Sheraton conducted no such survey but I sent them a letter anyway.

When we walked into the spacious, elegant Sheraton lobby I was surprised. It was lovely! It was just the first of many pleasant surprises we experienced at this hotel. We were traveling with a toddler and a bunch of heavy toddler gear. While I was trying to check in, my son ran over to the water fountain and stuck his hands in it, spraying water all over himself and the floor. In short, we were not the kind of guests a hotel is usually thrilled to see arrive. And yet, everyone had a smile for us. The bellhop took care of the floor in moments and the rep at the front desk smiled and said she thought maybe we could use some extra space for the little one. Complimentary upgrade! This never happens to families traveling with kids, I can assure you. We were shown to our room, which we were told had just been built and was brand new. Let's just say I nearly cried when I saw it. The room was huge, beautifully decorated and gave us tons of extra space for a crib and all that luggage. There was no view and the bathroom was a little small, but the space in the main room more than made up for it. We spent three days at this hotel and were completely comfortable the whole time. I was sad to leave. We requested a crib and a mini fridge. Both were brought to our room immediately after our arrival. Each and every employee we encountered at the Sheraton was friendly and helpful. There is free internet in the lobby and the hotel connects to the Prudential mall. In bad weather you can walk all the way to Copley Square under cover through the mall. The Hynes Convention Center T Stop is just up the street.

The room was recently renovated and faces North with a distant view of Fenway Park to the West. The immediate view out of the room window would be the roof of the adjacent Hynes Convention Center. The room includes a large 37 inch LCD TV, air-conditioning/heating, in-room safe, Bliss toiletries, iron, ironing board, cafeteria and hair dryer. There is no fridge or mini bar in the room. The hotel is easily accessible from the Prudential T station on the red 'E' line. You would turn left upon exiting the T station barriers and taking the escalator up into The Prudential Center. Take the escalator up again outside The Cheesecake Factory and then turn left at the top. Walk down the mall corridor with P.F Chang restaurant and US postal office on your left hand side and the outdoor fountain (south garden) on your right. At the bottom of the corridor would be a Dunkin Donuts and turning left here you should see the Sheraton Hotel entrance. The hotel lobby would be one floor down. The hotel lobby is enormous with plenty of seating area. There are approximately 9 computer terminals with free internet access and free wifi is also available in the lobby. It was never too long to wait for an available computer. There is an on site Starbucks coffee however the prices are just slightly higher compare to a normal Starbucks on the streets. The hotel room is large and very quiet. The room is clean and the toilet is of a fair size. The air-conditioning unit is quite abit noisy though. The only complaint is you will get acceptable warm-hot water from the shower but not very hot water for some people who prefer. The pressure from the shower is very good and there is a bath tub. The bedding is good and soft. A duvet is also provided. A swimming pool and fitness center is availble for guests to use free of charge on the 5th floor. The fitness center is small and mainly concentrated on weights. I did not see a single treadmill being present. The hotel is very well located for the convenience of shopping and food. There are numerous restaurants in The Prudential Center providing take out and there is also a food court and Shaw's supermarket. There were nights I preferred to eat in the hotel room rather than in the restaurants. The adjoining Copley Place can be accessed from The Prudential Center via the connecting footbridge. Boylston Street and Newbury Street are easily accessible on foot. Taking the T to Downtown Crossing or Fanueil Hall will take approximately 20 minutes.

The hotel features moderately sized, but very nice rooms that feature great bedding, large flat screen TVs, ample desk space and nice modern bathrooms that appear to have been recently remodeled. The pool, gym and spa are of the hotel are fantastic. The pool is large and divided to allow for two lanes of lap swimming while leaving plenty of unrestricted space for leisurely swimming. The pool is under a retractable roof so on nice days it is open-air, but when it is cooler or the weather is bad it becomes an indoor space. The area also features a large hot tub, a sauna and a very nice workout facility. We were really impressed, and used the hot tub multiple times after long days of sightseeing to ease our aching feet and legs. We also appreciated the free computers in the lobby that registered guests could use. It also appeared that there was free WiFi in the lobby, but we were not traveling with a computer. The hotel is just minutes away from world-class dining, so we did not try the restaurants or room service. The staff were friendly and helpful and able to offer discounts to some attractions. My only complaint, and this is really minor, is that our room was not ready when we arrived (which was to be expected since we arrived before check-in). The front desk took a cell phone number and promised to call when it was ready. We never got the call, but when we returned from a pre-booked tour, the room was ready.

Make similar trip a couple of times a year. Have never, and would not, pay rack rate. If we con't get a \"deal\" we'll stay elsewhere.... Don't get us wrong -- it's a fantastic location with a friendly staff that, for the most part, will do their best to meet your needs. If you have a meeting at the Hynes Convention Center in the Prudential Center, this is definitely the place for you. There's a direct, indoor connection from the hotel's meeting area to the Prudential Center. Grab breakfast at one of several places in The Pru on your way to the meeting.....hotel's restaurant breakfast will run you close to twenty dollars per person including tip! For meals not included in your meeting, The Pru has several good restaurant choices.....and it's connected by enclosed walkways to two other hotels/shopping areas. For non-work hours, this is the ideal location for getting around town! You can get to the Prudential \"T\" (subway) station without ever going outdoors. Publc bus transportation to areas not served by the subway is half a block away in one direction, a block away in another, and two blocks in a third. Hotel Concierge can be very helpful for the best way to get where you're going. In our experience, there may be some connection between the rate you're paying and the room you actually get (they aren't all the same size!). This most recent stay we got a deeply discounted rate through a Hilton promotion, were given one of the recently remodeled rooms in the North Tower (better security than in the South Tower based on a purse-snatching experience in the South Tower a few years ago). From experience we requested, and were granted, a room on a floor high enough to avoid looking directly at the wall of the Hynes Center next door (don't hesitate to ask about view during check-in). That said, the room itself had some real plusses and minuses -- the furnishings were obviously new and attractive -- nice work station for computer etc,. coffee table with a swiveling top making it very convenient for use from the easy chair, and a super shower with rain-fall shower head, However, there were no towel racks in the bathroom beyond one in the back of the shower, meaning the only convenient place to hang used towels and wash cloths was over the shower rod. And while the king-sized bed was very comfortable, it was located so close to the adjacent wall on one side that the person on that side of the bed had to turn sideways just to get to the head of the bed -- obviously no nightstand for eyeglasses, etc on that side of the bed.... Had none of the problems (beyond the cost) with valet parking that others have mentioned. They were at carside immediately upon our arrival.. And, as requested, we called down about twenty minutes before check-out to ask them to bring it around -- it was being parked at curbside as we arrived downstairs with our luggage. As far as the cost, it's increased steadily over the past several years.....and it is what it is because there are few alternatives if you want to park anywhere near the hotel. We just figure it into our overall cost when deciding where to stay. So far, the other advantages of this location have outweighed their hefty parking fee. All in all, the room was above average for the price we paid -- but if we'd actually paid the rack rate, we probably would have been disappointed,,,,", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kenosha, WI", "Title": "\u201cwonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "twinkKenosha_WI", "ReviewID": "UR34968250", "Content": "We recently returned from a week long vacation in Boston and found the Sheraton to be a wonderful hotel.

The location was extremely convenient and the room served its purpose as a place to rest our heads after our busy days in beautiful Boston.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel / Great Location\u201d", "Author": "SF-Coast-Traveler", "ReviewID": "UR34560379", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Boston for 3 nights. This two tower hotel is located adjacent to the Prudential Center Office and Shopping complex in the Back Bay area of Boston. The Prudential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Station (Heath Street Green Line) is a short 5 minute walk from the hotel, either via the exterior of the building or through the Prudential Center. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd line connects to the other lines at the Park Street, Government Center, and Haymarket stations. The Prudential Center is home to a moderate size shopping center with a good selection of restaurants including California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), PF Changs, Cheesecake Factory, a food court, a salad caf\u00c3\u00a9, and an Au Bon Pain bakery to name a few. There is a large, well stocked, market across the street from the CPK that offers a deli, bakery, and full service meat department. There is access to the Back Bay train station (about a 15 minute walk) via the Copley Place shopping complex. The front office staff were efficient and friendly and accommodated my request for a room in the South Tower as renovations were in progress in parts of the North Tower. The front desk clerk advised me my South Tower room had been renovated within the past few years. The room was a comfortable size with two twin beds, a desk, and a large LCD TV. An iron and ironing board were in the closet. The furniture and bed coverings appeared to be in good shape. I found the bed to be comfortable and the linens clean and crisp. The heating and air-conditioning unit worked well. The bathroom did not appear to have been renovated (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this for sure) but nevertheless it was clean and well serviced. The toilet was the older \u00e2\u20ac\u0153power flush\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type and was a bit noisy. I did not use any of the food and beverage facilities at the hotel as there were a number of other choices within the immediate vicinity of the hotel. I did, however, visit the Starbucks outlet located in the lobby. There are several computer stations in the lobby with Internet access with 30 minutes of free access per day for hotel guests on a first come first served basis. Additionally there are several stations with Internet access ports for those guests with their own laptops. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool is located on the mezzanine level between the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two towers. I did not use the pool or visit the area directly, but looking down on the area from my room it appeared to be clean and the area well kept. I was able to secure a sub $100 room rate via Hotwire and found the hotel, especially because of its great location, to be good value for my money. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. GETTING TO THE HOTEL VIA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (approximately 30 minutes at a cost of $2) From the airport; take the Blue Line subway to the Government Center Station. Exit the train, go up one level, and board the Green Line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heath Street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd train. Disembark at the Prudential Center Station and turn left as you exit the fare gates. At the top of the escalator, exit the doors in front of you, turn right and walk to the stop light. Turn right again and walk for five minutes and the hotel will be on your right. Or, you can access the hotel via the Prudential Center by turning right at the top of the station escalators, going through the glass doors, up the shopping center escalators, then turning left and following the corridor around to the other side of the shopping center and turning left again into the hotel. Walk through the ballroom area and down the escalators to the lobby. Because my flight departed at 6AM, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was not running that early in the morning. I took a taxi to the airport (approximately 15 minutes) which cost $28 inclusive of gratuity.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tipperary", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant staff brilliant hotel\u201d", "Author": "richyintipp", "ReviewID": "UR34109734", "Content": "stayed in this hotel as part of honeymoon trip to usa, had disaster stay in paramount new york but sheraton made up for it, welcomed by friendly reception staff who asked us reason for visit when we told them for honeymoon put us in king room on top floor of hotel overlooking city, room was very big with the most comfortable hotel bed i've ever slept in, went for walk in beautiful surrounding backbay and on return had found champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and congratulations card from hotel. i would recommend this hotel highly, right next door to shopping mall and short distance from main shopping streets and sight seeing trolleys leave from front door could not fault this hotel", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cRight in the Thick of Things\u201d", "Author": "CTTRVL", "ReviewID": "UR33973986", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for the July 4th weekend and we were not disappointed.

It reminded me of rooms I have stayed in while visiting London where hotel rooms are notoriously small. The bathroom was tiny too and the toilet never flushed on the first attempt.

Teen daughter & I took the opportunity to visit colleges. Had seen alarmng things abt this hotel, esp. bugs, on the forum. No bugs, all clean. Our only serious complaint is that the lightweight down filled quilt is lined with some sort of plastic--it feels like it's vinyl when you rub the sides together in your hands---and because you are sleeping under what amounts to a shower curtain, you wake up drenched in sweat off & on all through the night. The pillows have the same problem. All three of us had this complaint, so it is not just me the middle aged lady having hot flashes (which I am all done with anyway). We had the AC turned to 65 and we still sweated to death. If we go there again I am bringing my own pillow! And maybe blanket. We arrived at nearly midnight without having had dinner & the very courteous bar ladies took our last minute order (the kitchen is open till midnight for orders from the bar) of clam chowder & chicken quesadillas. These were fine for late night & last minute, but $7/cup for soup & $14 for quesad. Did I say the staff was courteous & lovely? They were great; every experience we had with staff was excellent. Thanks to this site, we knew to ask about the construction noise, and the south tower was full, so the desk gave us a 6th floor room in the north. We never heard any noise while there, although we heard about it from other guests! Our room was one of the newly decorated ones---all new and angly and dark wood. The guest who commented on the TV is correct---while it is a nice flat screen, they give you about 12 channels, most of which are worthless. No PBS, no MSNBC, you had better like late night ads and Nancy Grace because that is all that they have on the channels they give. Although they do have NESN for the Sox fans. Oh, yes and about 4 channels advertising some aspect of Sheratons. They do have the Weather Channel & CNN (which while we were there rattled on endlessly about Michael Jackson; at least he knocked the philandering governor off the air). On the second day, the desk phone stopped working, which my husband needed. He was able to use the bedside one, but the other phone wasn't fixed/replaced during our stay. They have a sign in the room asking you to save water by reusing your towels, which we would gladly do if they installed towel bars for us to let them dry! There is just one small one, and it is in the shower -- your towel won't get dry there if the other person/s take a shower! The bathroom is tiny but if only one person uses it at a time it's OK. Oddly, there is no towel bar for a hand/face towel near the sink; you have to drape this one over the small dark wood bookcase under the sink--the damp will eventually wreck the wood of this piece. The table/desk on which the TV sits is long enough for you to place things to work or for family's items. There is also a wide shelf under the window the full width of the room, if you need to place suitcases, etc, on something. My daughter wanted to check facebook for birthday greetings f rom friends, but was usually frustrated by the long lines to use the lobby computers. My husband's company paid for our stay, so for the price I have no complaints! But if we had to pay for it, I would not go back to this one---I'd spend it elsewhere.

The best thing about this hotel is that the rooms are very new. North Tower was rehabbed in 2009, South Tower in 2007. Everything is clean. My room was a standard room, nothing fancy, but well furnished, and clean. Flat screen TV (but with no high-def or digital channels). The finishes, etc., are not as nice as Westin but are fine. Bathroom was well -lit with good water pressure and very hot water, but tiny. Towels were pretty thin and worn out but that's not a big deal for me. Construction is finished except in Club Floors (26 - 29) of North Tower. Being on 23rd floor, I could hear the construction. I was up early so it didn't bother me but I could not have slept in past when the noise started (7 am). It was loud enough to awaken me but muffled enough that the noise did not bother me when I was awake. I think a few floors down and it would not have been audible. I chose this hotel because of the pool. It is 18 meters long, which is pretty decent for a center city hotel in an older city. The water was overchlorinated and a bit on the warm side for laps, and the pool was very crowded, but I did manage to get a decent swim. The large health club had a lot of cardio and treadmills. Lobby has free wi-fi, and lots of big tables with lighting that make it very user friendly. I worked there for several hours one night rather than being cooped up in my room. This is a major convention hotel. As someone else commented, the advantage of that is that if you have Starwood status, you'll likely get an upgrade since most guests probably don't have status.

My wife and I are in town for her commencement ceremonies at BU. Not only were the hotel rates outrageously high, but for that amount of money, you'd think we'd get more than a closet of a room. We arrived Friday May 15th. We were given a room in the North tower and told that on Monday, we might be woken up at 7a because of construction. We asked to switch towers because that was our one day of rest and relaxation. But, there were no rooms anywhere else available, or so we were told. We were told to come back on Saturday or Sunday night to see if we could be moved then but alas, we would be busy all day, each day. We were expected to miss graduation to be given accommodations that we should have received anyway. When we told the woman we'd be out and about until at least 10p each night, we were met with a shrug. When we got to our room, the chemical smell was so bad, my wife had an asthma attack. Suddenly, another room opened up on the 20th floor. The smell wasn't as bad but the room size sure was. We could barely fit the two of us in the room at the same time, never mind the bathroom. Our toilet was old and gross (already??!?!) and the guests that came into town for this special occasion couldn't even come up to the room because they wouldn't fit! Not to mention the bed. There is no way this old bed is a \"Sweet Sleep\" bed. It's a regular old mattress. The comforter is so old, it's actually bumpy. And we had 4 pillows, not one of them a special embroidered one. No silky sheets. Nadda. Then there is the internet. $9.95 (which I just had to pay again to type this to you...or re-type as it cut out on me the first time) a day for \"high speed internet\" that I have to use from a desk? No wireless? Get with the times! Especially in a room so small I can't sit at the desk nd have my wife pass by me to get to the only other chair in the room. For $250+ a night, we expected more. Especially after viewing the ads on TV that you have running in the lobby that make the standard rooms seem bigger than they really are. In these hard economic times, you'd think that you'd want to advertise getting more for your customer's dime, but I guess that's all just an illusion too? To make room for more of your new suites. You can keep your \"amazing views\" (not from the 11th floor they weren't) and give me a hotel with better service and one that's reached the technological advancements of 2005.

I arrived one day early and was told that the only room they had would cost $459. They would not honor my $220 convention rate. Therefore I went up the street to the Marriott and was given an excellent room for $219. The next day I checked into the Sheraton. The lobby is impressively large, modern looking and with a comfortable bar. There are several areas where one can use computers for internet or printing boarding passes. Check in was efficient and the staff friendly. The room I was assigned was on the sixth floor, even side. Upon entering my initial impression was one of drab, tired and disappointing. It was dimly lit and my view was of a brick wall that was the side of the Hynes Convention Center. The view below was of vents protruding from a roof. By craning my head up I could see some sky. At least it was quiet. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double bed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd promised by the desk clerk was really a double. This was probably fortunate in that if it had been any larger the room would have been more cramped. There was a dark blue comforter on the bed covering a not new pilled and snagged light brown polyester blanket. Ordinary sheets and mattress. The TV was an older Phillips analog type. After settling in I quickly noticed a number of anomalies. The most obvious a section of wall paper at the entrance to the bathroom that was peeled back several inches and just hanging. In the bathroom the sink had a Y shaped crack across the bottom and the drain plug was completely missing. There were several hairs on the floor and a corner beneath the sink had obviously not seen a mop for some time. A bit more investigating revealed dust bunnies behind the bed and end tables. Most surprisingly a mans blue sock lay beneath the foot of the bed where even the most cursory of cleaning would have encountered it. The peel-off part of a band aid was on the floor next to the wall by the door where anyone cleaning the room should have seen it. It remained there for my two day stay. I had only one meal which was the $20 breakfast buffet. For the money the selection was slim and the food quality no better than one would find in mid level hotel outside the city. It was certainly not on a level expected from a name brand hotel in a prestigious downtown Boston location. Overall I will summarize this Sheraton as an overpriced and underwhelming property that only survives due to its proximity to the Hynes Convention Center. It reminds me of a 1980s Holiday Inn found in the mid west. I checked out after my mandatory two nights and moved across the street to the Hilton for my last night in Boston. The room was $223.

I confess we were here because the Jurys was fully booked, but we were still more than happy with our choice. Firstly, the hotel itself. Its a large towering hotel, split into two towers and forms part of the Prudential Centre, a large convention/conference facility as well as linking to a fairly classy shopping centre. We had a room in the South Tower, somewhere upwards of the 20th floor. The views from the room were gret, but we were the wrong side to get a vista over the centre of the city (images attached). The room was a good size and more than comfortable enough for two of us for 5 nights. Great big comfy bed, room to spread out in the room. The bathroom was big enough, but not the most stylish I've been in. There is cabled internet access in the rooms but wireless is only available in the lobby. there are also about eight desktop machines free for guests to use. They are however very busy and prone to crashing. On the occaisions we ate at the hotel.... room service is good and swift, either for dinner or breakfast. Breakfast in the restaurant is okay, but not the best value you'll find, or indeed the tastiest. The lobby bar is, unfortunately, the only bar. I find this surprising for a hotel of this size and it does get busy. The bar food is pretty good value though. As we were there for a birthday, I had requested a bottle of champagne and flowers for the room. This was arranged in advance, without fuss. I can recommend contacting Michael who was great and followed up to ensure we had everything. Indeed, all the staff we encountered, be it on reception, in the bar or on the door, were friendly, helpful and efficient. As I said, the hotel is tied to a large conference centre and towards the end of the stay a rather large gathering of religious scholars descended upon the place. Not ideal if you are after a quiet time as there is simply no escaping the delegates if they are in residence. Location wise, the hotel is great.

Shopping, restaurants, and services abound. What more can you ask for? The beds and linens make for a great sleep. The rooms are on the smaller side with very limited dresser space. There is definitely not enough room for four people's clothes. The bathroom has very limited counter space for toiletry items.

Never in my 40 plus years of hotel stays have I ever encountered a hotel that ran out of towels. We called several times asking for towels but were told each time that there weren't any. For a hotel of this caliber, I cannot understand how they could run out of towels. Granted, some people don't use a washcloth, but for those of us who did and asked for them, couldn't they have run to Costco to pick up some? Would I stay here again? The location is great, but with the number of nearby hotels, it's hard for me to justify saying yes when our experience had so many problems. I tried to give the hotel the benefit of a doubt and contacted the hotel after our stay to share my concerns, but the e-mail went unanswered.

The only thing is the hotel seems to close the club lounge if the hotel isnt running at capacity, we were the for 8 nights in total and it was only open twice. Reception gave us vouchers for breakfast in the hotel restaurant and also vouchers for appotizers in the side bar in reception. Compared to the breakfast that is served in the club lounge (muffins, bagels, tea/coffee, juice and fruit - continental) the breakfast in the main restaurant is much better value as you get full buffet access with hot and cold foods so it worked out really well for us to get given vouchers instead! Hotel location is excellent, connected to the prudential center so you dont even have to venture outside with lots of good shops and restaurants to choose from, P.F.Changs and Cheesecake Factory are a must.

It was tolerable, and that's about it. I stayed at the Sheraton in Back Bay from November 21-25 for a business conference. For a hotel whose primary purpose is to serve business travelers, I was horrified at the lack of complimentary services and the quality of those that that I was charged for. Wired internet was $9.95 per night and very unreliable-- on the third night of my stay, the automatic prompt for daily payment wouldn't load. After an hour with no luck, I called the front desk only to learn there is no helpdesk within the hotel and I was instead patched through to Sprint. After over 30 minutes on the phone with a rep, I finally had the internet service reactivated, but for me having to go through this hassle was completely unacceptable while away on a business trip. I had three small packages (8, 10, and 13 lbs) shipped to me at the hotel; on my bill at checkout, there was a business center charge for $53. I was told by the front desk that \"there's work involved\" when guests receive packages and that the hotel charges a fee based on the weights of packages. I always have packages shipped to me at hotel, and in my numerous, numerous stays at other hotels have NEVER been charged a fee to receive parcels. Again, this is unacceptable for a hotel that claims it's for business travelers. As for my room, I had a spectacular view from the 24th floor in the north tower, but that was really where the postives stopped. My single room (queen bed) was incredibly small. The desk was positioned at the foot of the bed and it was impossible to push the desk chair back all the way out from under the desk to get in and out because it hit the bed! There was barely any clearance between the chair and bed even when the chair was pushed all the way under the desk. The closet doors when opened blocked the bathroom door. TV channels were limited and four out of five nights the satellite signal went out repeatedly while I was watching. Valet parking is absurdly expensive at $41 per night. Overall, the room was liveable but certainly no where near comfortable.

The hotel is convenient as it is part of the Prudential Center and thus its a very short inside walk to the convention center. As a result of this (and because of reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor regrading the food) we didn't use any of the hotel facilities as the Prudential Center has everything one needs. Room allocation appears to be key. This is borne out reading other reviews. My room was very small with an uncomfortably small bath room. The room suffered from significant plumbing noises. I couldn't decided whether this was something to do with the aircon or it was water rushing through pipes. Whatever there was an obtrusive rushing sound and then a 'bang' when it cut off. Given that the noise generally started about 4:00am ish and continued relentlessly throughout the remainder of the early morning I suspect it was the plumbing, or specifically, the flushing. On the plus side thee bed was very comfortable and everything in the room worked. The walls in this part of the hotel (North Tower - 20th floor) are thin and it was noisy. For example could hear next door flicking the light switches. Others have commented on this. So, judging on my experience alone, I'd not be impressed. However, my colleague down the hall had a much bigger room and none of the aforementioned issues! As a SPG member with a few points to my name I would have expected a better room - a feeling confirmed when it transpired that my colleague and I had inadvertently swapped rooms and I should have been in the bigger one without the plumbing noises. It does make me wonder however whether the 'noisy small' rooms are allocated to those paying the conference rate or whether it was just luck of the draw. Internet was $9.95 + $.50 'telephone tax' for 24 hours and worked fine. They also have free wifi in the lobby so if you just want to check email in the morning/evening you don't have to pay at all.

We were on the \"starwood preferred guests\" floor. I don't know what that entails. I was in room 2665 which had a king size bed, desk & chair, flat screen tv (32 inches I think), sofa chair w/ foot rest, small ottoman under a full length mirror, and a cushioned bench at the foot of the bed. The mattress was VERY comfortable. The room was clean. It had 2 huge windows (corner room) which had fabulous views of boston. The maid service was good. Replaced all towels & toiletries & tidied up. We used valet parking. It was about $40 a day. They ask that you give 30 minutes notice that you need your car but they will get it to you in about 10 minutes. Internet is $4.50 for 1/2 hour or $9.00 for 24 hours. Doesn't make much sense to me but we went with the 24 hrs. We also had some phone charges when the only thing we called was within the hotel. We probably should have questioned it. It was a couple of bucks. The bathroom was clean. Not the newest but it was pretty nice & clean. The toilet flushed SO loudly. It was almost like an airplane. It woke up my husband one night when I used it in the middle of the night. We ordered room service breakfast one morning. The lady who brought it was very nice & rolled it into the room & set everything up for us. The food wasn't that great though.

For starters, before arriving we called the hotel to request two beds and a rollaway cot in the room. The person with whom we spoke was quite rude and stated that since we booked through Priceline, she could not accomodate any of our requests, that we were wasting our time speaking with her and we would have to see what was available when we arrived. Be forewarned, as mentioned in other revieiws, when we arrived, we were informed that the only option for parking our car was through the hotel's valet for a cost of $41 per night. At check-in we requested a renovated room, but we were given a room on the 25th floor of the non-renovated tower. At that time we requested a rollaway bed/cot. The 25th floor looks worn (scratched doors, frayed carpet) and our room was horrible (looked like it was decorated in the '80s) - smelly with a huge stain in the middle of the carpet, stains on the dark blue duvet/comforters, rip in the blue velvet curtains, hairs and mold in the bathroom, dirt inside the drawers and a huge TV that looked about 10 years old which didn't get reception on several channels. We complained, but were told that since we booked through Priceline, our room could not be changed. (Regardless of how one books their room, it seems to us that guests should be enititled to clean, pleasant rooms...) Three hours after we had checked in, we still had not received the rollaway bed. We called the front desk to follow up, and after another two hours (long after we had hoped to put our youngest child to bed), the bed was delivered without any extra pillows or blankets. When we requested these items from the guy who delivered them, he told us that these items were not available because they were all \"really dirty.\" Our kids swam in the pool, but the hotel does not employ any lifeguards, so parents have to keep a close eye on their kids. Due, in part, to the retractable roof, after sundown the pool area is poorly lit, and it's a bit tough to keep track of three kids in the pool without adequate lighting. To get to the bathroom/locker room from the pool, you have to go through a freezing cold area where the treadmills are located. The locker room is gross - uncleaned toilet, filthy showers, hair dryers sitting in puddles of water (not very safe). All of that being said, the location of the hotel is fabulous - in the heart of Boston and attached to the Prudential Center which is an upscale mall with several restaurants and a great food court (which is convenient when you have kids to feed).

Reading some of the other reviews I found myself agreeing more than not. I've been here in Boston for the last 5 weeks. I hav stayed at the Marriott and the Hilton all with in a stone throw of the Shraton. Sadly I rank this one third. Whats Good. Decent sized rooms, and hands down the MOST comfortable beds of all the chains in the area. That's important to any business traveller. Quality towels and Bath products. Sheraton doesn't allow those old frayed towels. The Pool, Gym and lobby are great as well. Also again the Service is good, everyone projects helpfulness and I believe they are sincere. What needs improvement. Well for the bucks it's competitive, but frankly this hotel is in need of some major renovation if it wants to compete with the in room amenities of some of the other hotels. The TV's and remotes.. well leave much to be desired. Small Desks- Mine looks like a chouch end table. Not muchto spreadout on, and If I ordered room service I'd have to move my laptop to the bed. The toilets look they are right out your high school gym. Clean yes, but old cracked tiles with stained grout stands out. The Lamps are flecked with chipped paint from years of use. And I am wondering the last time my phone was cleaned, as there is an interesting film around the ear hole. Also No in room safes. For a business traveller, well frankly it leaves you wanting more. It reminds me of the old Hamton inn's before the national makeover. But again The bed almost guarantees you'll sleep well. Personally I prefer the LAN connections to wi fi. So for m that's a plus over the Hilton across the street. (All Wi Fi) Personally I haven't tried the food, becuase there are MANY great eating places all within walking distance. The menu looks typical. There's a burger, Pizza, a few salads etc. Again I recomend eating out just for the variety.

It was a corner room, with full height windows to two sides, giving us a great view across Boston. The room was very comfortable, and looked to have been recently redecorated. The bathroom however looked rather tired, and although clean, was in need of refurbishment. Despite being a fairly upscale Sheraton the room lacked certain features : there was no in room safe, which meant any valuables had to be left in safety deposit boxes at reception; there was no mini bar, or complimentary water, although coffee/tea were provided; there was no shower cap in the bathroom, and only small quantities of shower gel etc. These are, however, minor issues, and did not impact on our overall enjoyment of the stay. We were on a room only deal, but there is a Starbucks in the reception area where you can get coffee and muffins if you don't fancy the hotel's full breakfast. The free internet service in the lobby is a real bonus, allowing us to check in for our return flight with ease. The hotel links directly into the Prudential centre, a mid-scale shopping centre with a reasonable range of shops and restaurants. This in turn links to the upscale Copley Plaza shopping centre, definately worth a visit!

This property was more reasonable so booked 3 nights via the SPG website chosing a Club room for $199 rather than a Standard at $159- Big mistake! The Room appeared to offer nothing much more than could be expected from a normal one and I agree with the other reviews here that the rooms are small (particularly the bathroom). The only difference was the fact that it was on the 26th floor (the top 3 floors are the 'Club Floors') the corridor of which was very dark and by staying here you got access to their 'Club' on the 29th floor which whilst providing basic breakfast esentials looked tired as was not the sort of place I'd have wanted to have spent a lot of time. Unlike previous lounges I have been to, it also charged for alcohlic beverages which made me wonder what was the point in paying an extra $40 per night if all I was getting for my money was a higher floor and a basic continental breakfast. Needless to say the first night I and a colleague went there and were told it was $4 dollars for a beer we left and went to a bar with better decor and atmosphere! The other complaint I have with the room is that there was no in room safe-this is normally always provided in US hotels of this standard - I only keep my passport, travel tickets and some cash in them when they are provided but they are useful and being told by the hotel that they have safe deposit boxes at Reception was not a great solution. This again left me wondering what I was paying for couldnt they put safes in the Club floor rooms to give an 'added benefit'?. I used the restaurant once for breakfast and the decor felt very tired and it was, like most hotels, overpriced for breakfast which I sometimes dont mind if it makes you feel like you are getting more for your money in terms of ambience etc. The hotel is however situated in a good location attached to the Mall with restaurants nearby (I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs in the Mall and if travelling further afield Maggianos, Abe and Louies and Ruth Chris). Staff that I encountered were pleasant and overall the hotel delivered (i.e. a clean and comfortable room) it was just that I thought I would, with the room type I booked, and the fact that I am a Gold SPG holder, got something better.

Boarding passes can be printed at a special kiosk, but any other printing or business needs are available at a business center upstairs in the conference center. This property is huge and geared towards conventions, but the staff was friendly and helpful. Cabs within in Boston are cheap! It was $5 including tip to go to the theater across town! The subway, the \"T\", is located in the Prudential Center, and the ride to and from the airport took about 25-30 minutes terminal to hotel. A bus at the terminal takes you to the \"T\" and drops you back at any of the terminals at Logan. This is probably the quickest, and cheapest, way to get in and out of Boston.

Then got to the room which was ok - a decent size on the 6th floor but absolutely no view except a lot of concrete buildings and quite a distance from the elevator. What I found really annoying was the lack of a room safe and other amenities such as a small fridge, pay bar, free internet in room, etc. I traveled with my laptop and some jewelry and it was most annoying to have to put them in the lobby safe....very inconvenient. I then became horrified, as I am not an animal lover and tend to avoid hotels that allow pets, that there was a very large barking dog two doors down from me - the people had left the dog in the room for the morning....Do you even wonder how they get these rooms cleaned after a large dog has slubbered and whatever else all over the room.

Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I give it 2 stars: I had reserved a fridge and microwave at an additional cost of $60/stay but when I called to confirm the reservation before leaving for Boston, it was not on the reservation. So the person placed it on there. When I checked in I asked the employee if the fridge/micro were on the reservation and she said yes. Then the check in desk sent us to the wrong tower (south tower). But once we got to our 5th floor room in the north tower, there was no fridge or microwave so I had to call housekeeping. Only positive thing here is they appeared with both within 10 mins. But of course the fridge was not cold so that was an inconvenience since we had brought items we wanted to keep cold. The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view was of the fitness/pool area but luckily we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about a room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. The room and furnishings were clean and in working order. The beds, linens & pillows were nice, soft, and comfortable but we expected more for the price; they were exactly the same as the ones in Portland for which we stayed at for $85/night. The heating/cooling unit worked great and kept the room at the temperature designated. Either the room was very sound proof or our neighbors on both sides were very quiet because we never heard a peep from either room. The bathroom was clean however the water pressure from the sink and shower head were not acceptable, way too weak. The water from the tub faucet was strong so we had to rinse our hair using that. We left a note for housekeeping with the tip but they only fixed the sink. My sister had to take apart the showerhead and found it almost completely clogged with black pebbles. After she cleaned it, it worked great. Too bad housekeeping could not fix it for us. The pool, whirlpool and sauna are free to use but I cannot speak to the fitness machines since we did not have time to use them. We wanted to use the whirlpool but the water was cold; not lukewarm but COLD! It did not get fixed until the night before we left, Thur. Not good because after a day of walking Boston we wanted to sit in the hot tub! The location is excellent. It is attached to the Prudential Center with shopping, dining and info about attractions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk to Boston Commons, about a \u00c2\u00bd hour, and also close to Fenway Park and Newbury St, the Rodeo Dr of Boston. As two females, the area felt safe to walk day or night. The hotel offers guests free internet access in the lobby for 45 mins per session (maybe day?) but many times as many as a third of PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were inoperable. The hotel also offers access to a PC from which you can print your boarding pass but you need to know your flight number. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, you need to go to one of the internet PC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and get it; a bit of a pain.

We arrived around 2 p.m. and there was no line to check in. There are apples on the counter for a great snack option. We had a room on the 25th floor with a great view of the Christian Scientist church. We had a couple of issues with sounds; we were able to hear our neighbor's conversation on night at 2:45 a.m., and we were able to hear some partygoers returning to their room one night. I read some reviews previously about rooms being to small; I did not feel that this was the case. The beds were very comforable. They had plush blankets that were great to sleep under. My only complaint would be that the vent in the bathroom was extremely dusty. The elevator was quick. We never had to wait long to get to where we were going. We did not actually swim in the pool but we did spend time reading by the pool. The indoor pool with a retractable is part of the Atlantis Fitness Club which is housed at the Sheraton. Hotel guests have to sign in. There are 2 lanes for lap swimming and about 2 lanes worth of area for free swim/play. Directly near the pool there were chaise lounges with plush pads. There were plenty of chaise lounges in a courtyard area adjacent to the pool. It was a great area to spend time in to relax and read a good book. The Sheraton Boston is accessible to a plethora of places and activities. If you get off the elevator at the 2nd floor, you have immediate access the Prudential Center shops which connect to the Copley Place mall. We frequented the food court at Prudential for a cheaper option for breakfast. There is a T stop (Prudential) that is very close, just be sure to the take the green line (Heath St.). We had a 2 day pass on the Beantown Trolley, which has a stop directly outside of the Sheraton. Copley Square, Boston Common/Public Gardens, and the Freedom Trail are all within walking distance of the Sheraton.

The check-in clerk didn't have all of the reservation information correct; I had to show her my copy of the confirmation, after which she mysteriously found it (although one of the other people I was sharing the room with had extreme difficulty checking in). 2. The sheets were scratchy and the pillows were uncomfortable. 3. There was no mini-fridge in the room. 4. The bathtub was not clean. 5. Twice I had to call guest service multiple times to get extra towels and clothes hangers delivered - they never responded on the first call, even after an hour. 6. They charge $10 a day for internet access from the rooms, which is completely ridiculous. 7. Even though the maids obviously knew that we had four or five people in the room because of the cot and the number of suitcases, they always left only 3 towels. They would also pick up the dirty water glasses, but not replace them with clean ones. 8. We ran out of toilet paper and there was no extra roll in the bathroom. 9. There were several people staying in the room, and we were supposed to split the cost according to the nights we had stayed. I have done this several times before at other hotels, and it has never been a problem; the hotel has always divided the charges correctly. However, the Boston Sheraton not only tried to charge me the entire amount (even though the other guests' names were on the reservation and I told them when I checked that we would be splitting the costs), they also had charged me twice for internet usage for the same day! In short, this was the worst value I have ever gotten out of a hotel stay - we got a special \"discount\" rate of $270 per night for a tiny, cramped, unlean room with small beds, uncomfortable bedding, an ugly view, and poor service.

The hotel is in a perfect location for visiting Boston. To begin, Fenway is roughly a 15-20 minute walk through a nice area to catch a Red Sox game. If you need tickets, just go across the street (literally) to the Hilton where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find a small window that sells game day tickets at face value, best kept secret in Boston. The hotel is also attached/part of the biggest mall in Boston, so if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rainy day, no worries, spend your day exploring the exceptional shopping (i.e. Tiffany, Louis Vitton, Gucci, Neiman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Sak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, etc..) and various mid-priced restaurants. Additionally, there are two T stops located in the mall, so transportation to anywhere in Boston (and the outskirts) is a breeze, and again, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need to go outside if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nasty. Also, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Starbucks in the lobby and Dunkin Donuts in the mall about 100 feet away. For those days where the weather is sunny and the temperature is right, Boston Commons is short walk east down Boylston. On the way you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pass Abe & Louis steak house which I feel is overpriced for what you get (why in the world you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eat steak in Boston is beyond me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c keep in mind I live in Chicago) and their sister restaurant The Atlantic Fish Co. which is tasty, but expensive. Newbury street and their excellent shopping and restaurants is the next street North of Boylston so again, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re roughly a block from one of the biggest shopping destinations in the US. Again, this place is about location, location, location. Onto the hotel, when you come in for check in, if the line is long, or even a few people deep, use the check in Kiosk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re quick, easy, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an SPG member you get a bonus 500 points. The top four floors of the North Tower are the club floors, with the large club room on the 29th floor. Having stayed, or having co-workers that have stayed, in a vast majority of the Sheraton properties in the US, this club room is at the top. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large and provides and extensive Continental breakfast, including three cereals, fresh blueberries or raspberries, strawberries, melon(s), yogurt, cranberry, apple, and orange juice, milk and coffee, pastries, bagels, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The staff is excellent and very helpful and if you need an extra bottle (or four) of water or diet coke for your room there very happy to oblige. Please note, they always have glasses and mug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in the hotel (four days a week) for over a year and one week where they changed out styles did they provide paper cups. Finally, there are two computers with internet access in the club lounge so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a club floor and only want to do a few quick searches, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for internet and just use the club lounge. Now, being a Platinum SPG member I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m always upgraded/given access to the club level so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the upgrade cost is, but I imagine if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than $20-$25 per person (if you work out), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it for the savings on breakfast and workout facility. The evening hors d oeuvres are ok, they always have a desert cake or pie, two apps, fresh veggies and dip, assorted cheeses, and mixed nuts. Plus, the drinks aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily cheaper, but poured a lot harder in the club room. As far as the hotel rooms on the club floors go, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ok, nothing really exceptional that separates them from the rest of the hotel. Mostly you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel like you walked into a Polo ad, the only real difference is that you get bottled water for free, access to the lounge, a more upscale (note I did not say larger) bathroom, and most importantly free access to the workout/pool facility (a $10 per person per day value). The rest of the hotel is nice, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the Ritz, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying Ritz prices. If you want the Ritz, stay at the Ritz. This is a very nice Sheraton by nationwide Sheraton standards and if you get a good rate here you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy. With regards to problems, coming from someone who spends roughly 150-160 nights a year in hotels, this place does an incredible job at taking care of the guests. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by any other poster, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed almost 170 nights in this hotel alone, any issue or problem I had was resolved immediately, and if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I was credited bonus points, rate reductions, free rooms, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6often times the problem was resolved immediately and I was still credited bonus points. Plain and simple, if you have a problem, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a jerk, but go down to the front desk and politely ask for the manager, explain the problem, and it will be resolved ASAP. As with anything in life, there are problems or cons, here are a few of mine. First, the cable selection and TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are pretty basic. There are 15-20 channels (one movie channel) on a 27 inch TV, not horrible, just not good or great. The bathrooms are tiny; if you need a large bathroom, request a handicapped room. Otherwise, they are very small, unless you happen to get one of the two-three room suites at the end of the club room floors. Finally, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wireless connection and the connection is fairly slow by my standards.

Yes, it was clean but it looked old and worn-out, a huge misfit or else it would have receive a perfect score. Valet was efficient and friendly but a rip-off at $39 (excluding tips). Good thing was we could draw our car from hotel by latest 4PM after check-out, so we could at least still wander around the city for 4 more hours. This hotel is the best in its excellent location.

A couple must-dos while you are in town: See the Prudential tower - I got in free, and not sure if it would have been worth the $11, but a great panoramic view and decent audio tour of the city. After you catch the lights, head up 2 more floors to the restaurant. As expensive as you would expect for dining with a view, but a great value - excellent crab cakes and a fascinating raspberry drink called Purple Rain. Wine was resonable too.

But I thought the Sheraton was phenomenal. Thanks to previous posters, I asked for a room in the South Tower. The room was very nice - new furniture, beds, etc. Only thing was that for a \"4 star\" room, I was hoping for a small fridge. Bathroom was nice and clean. Had a non-smoking room and smelled 100% clean. Location can't be beat. It's 1 block from the T (subway) and there are plenty of taxis at the hotel since it is across from the Hilton. The hotel is connected to the Prudential Center, which was a big plus. Lots of shops and restaurants at the Center and more could be found a block away on Boylston. Had no problems with the staff. Check-in was courteous and quick, although the gentleman didn't seem thrilled when I asked for a South Tower room. Housekeeping was on par and none of my belongings were missing or anything of the sort. Lobby has online computer stations and a big Starbucks. Didn't get to check out any of the on-site eateries, though. We went up to Boston for New Year's Eve weekend and the hotel was great for that purpose. It was a short cab ride to anywhere we needed to go. Only negative is that the parking garage is a bit far from the main lobby elevators and you have to compete for parking spaces with those who are there for the Prudential Center shops. If you have a rental, get your walking shoes ready. For the price we paid and the quality and location of the hotel, I give this an \"excellent\" review.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Maine", "Title": "\u201cGreat start, bad finish\u201d", "Author": "chriswin", "ReviewID": "UR6476907", "Content": "I wanted to go to Boston for a birthday weekend and was able to get the Sheraton by using Hotwire and Priceline (I was originally only going to stay one night and then added a second night, and I got a better deal on Priceline than Hotwire).

I immediately received a response offering me a one-bedroom suite at no additional charge. Check in was smooth, the room was great, the free internet in the lobby (they have computers you can sit at and access the internet by entering your name and room number - it is free) was an added bonus. The lobby also contains a Starbucks. The hotel is convenient to a T stop and the Prudential shops. My only issue is that my digital camera was stolen from my hotel room. I can't say exactly when it happened, but my best guess is while housekeeping was in my room they left the door open and since it was a suite someone easily could have walked in and grabbed my camera while housekeeping was in another part of the suite.

I had stayed there a few years back and was not impressed and probably would not stay there again, however I decided to try Priceline for the first time and was excited to get a rate of only $90 per night for two nights for a so called 4 star hotel in Back Bay. Then I saw it was the Sheraton that accepted my bid. I did some research and many sites indicated that this hotel just went through a 73 million dollar renovation. I was excited thinking all rooms are redone and nice and this would be a great stay. Boy was I in for a shock! I was put in a room on the 19th floor in the north tower and right off the elevator I could tell nothing has been remodeled or changed. Everything dark and depressing from the 60s or 70s. I entered into a dismal room with so many issues. A small dirty bathroom with mold in the shower area. Dirty grout on the walls and floor of the bathroom. A rusted out shower curtain rod. Chipped and pealing paint on the door frame. The room itself had a dirty carpet. Stains on the walls. Door to the room and closets are original from 1965 when the hotel opened and are all dinged and dented and look terrible. In room TV would not display the channels so you never could see what station you were on. Cleaning staff missed many things like leaving more toliet paper and ice bucket liner. The only thing I can say positive about this hotel is that the check in staff were very nice and the climate control system worked very well. Other than that, it is important that people who choose this hotel know that if you stay there demand to be put in the south tower or stay elsewhere. The south tower has been totally renovated. I went to a few floors to look and the halls are all modern and nice. Some floors stated they are for \"preferred guests. My own personal opinion is that anyone not paying full price is not a preferred guest and you get stuck in the dismal north tower. Don't be fooled by this hotel being connected to shopping malls, etc. There are so many better hotels I have stayed at in the general area with much higher standards. I did write to the management of Sheraton who agreed the room was terrible and pretty much just said sorry and they will address it, hope you try us again.

Being on a budget we had originally booked the Days Inn, across the river in Cambridge but ever the alert when it comes to email offers, I was very interested by a rate of $149 per night which the Sheraton was offering direct. We had already stayed at the Sheraton back in 2004 and really enjoyed the stay at that time, which included a free upgrade to a business level room. We didn't think a room offer of $149 would allow us anything but a standard room, how wrong we were!!!! So to check in, as previous this was very efficient with a lovely young lady whose name escapes me at the moment. We had our credit card cloned on our travels, so every time we used the card there were numerous security checks that had to take place. She was on the phone to our card service provider for about 20mins, but not once did she complain. She was the epitome of customer service. So check in complete and we headed off to our room. It wasn't on the business floor but we were not too bothered, we wouldn't be staying in the room for very long anyway. However we did notice once we got to the floor our room was on, that it was right down the corridor, the final room in fact. When we entered the room we were totally blown away, it was a suite!!!!! It was huge, there were 3 different sections to the room. Firstly a bedroom with the great sleeper bed and walk in closet, a hallway area which led to the bathroom, and a lounge area with a sofa, 2 chairs and the biggest television you could ever wish for. It was such a surprise and a great way to end our round the world trip, just beating the suite we had at the Ramada Hong Kong and the room at the Novotel Hong Kong airport for quality. I would say that the bathroom didn't quite match the quality of the rest of the suite, but it was still very nice. A little on the small side compared to some we have had in the USA. A further surprise followed about an hour after check in when there was a knock at the door. In came room service with the biggest tray of cheese, biscuits and fruit and also a bottle of red wine. The lady on the front desk had seen it was my birthday in the coming week, and offered this gift to us with the compliments of the hotel. What a nice touch!! All in all the room was fantastic, but you would expect that with it being a suite. The walk in closet was almost as big as a room at a Motel 6, it was just amazing. What surprised me even more was that this was a reduced rate, $149, normally it was $200 more than that a night according to the reception staff and that was just for a standard room. The hotel itself is in brilliant location within the Prudential Center. Walking distance to all the attractions Boston has to offer, and for those that require a T ride, there is a station right next to the hotel. There is also a Cheesecake Factory as well, always worth a visit. Boston is a great city but we tended to find that it was still quite fresh in our minds from our visit in 2004 and didn't quite have that wow factor it did the first time. However our round the world ticket left the USA to go back home from Logan, so it made sense to have a few days there. It is just a great city to walk around. We would certainly stay at the Sheraton Boston again next time we visit the city. The staff are so welcoming, probably the best we experienced in 7 months travel and always seem to try and give you that little bit extra, on this occasion a wonderful suite room. It was a great way to end our round the world trip. One final extra plus as well, there are free internet terminals (provided by Yahoo) in the lobby of the hotel. Log on with your room details and you get 45mins in any one session. There is also wi-fi available. Another huge plus from this great hotel.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Boston Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d89602-Reviews-Sheraton_Boston_Hotel-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$252 - $493*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">39 Dalton Street</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Prudential Center</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02199</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "89602", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/bf/ed/16/sheraton-boston-hotel.jpg"}}

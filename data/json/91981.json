I was a bit weiry at first as it was off the strip and me being a first time visiter to the states, never mind to sin city. I decided to book anyway and got a deluxe room for $390 inlcuding taxes and a $4.95 daily service fee (for use of the pool,Jacuzzi,Free Coffee,Free Wifi and local calls) which i think was ok considering some 3star hotels in vegas charge $20 per day! The reception staff were really friendly and helpful, The room was a little dated but clean and roomy even with the 2 queen beds! TV was something out of the dark ages and kept turning itself off but, There was 16 cable channels to choose from and its not like your in the hotel very often to watch it anyway. Possibly why they haven't been exchanged for flat screens? It can get quite noisy at night around the smoking rooms block, as it is situated next to the wild wild west truck stop. and its close to the freeway, but i didnt have any problems getting to sleep. Breakfast was included in the room rate, and was provided by dennys restaurant located in the back of the casino. You get three choices for breakfast from the 'value menu up to $4' choice of grand slam, cheese omlette or oatmeal..No modifcations can be made so after a few days i got bored. Kinda silly as there was cheaper treats on the breakfast menu like the blueberry pancake puppies with cream cheese frosting for $2..But they wouldnt let you switch. Waitresses always extremley hypo and happy especially the bubbly mexican/spanish lady who's name i cant remember but she always brightened up my morning with her dulcit tones 'muchos gracias senorita' The casino is small but unique, apparently dubbed ' the best little locals casino in vegas' they have 50c roulette and happy hour with $2 draughts and $2 shots 3pm-7pm and 11pm-3am. Cocktail waitresses don't frequent the penny slots very often so you have to try and follow her around a little, or wait a while to get your 'free' or $1 drinks. But once you tip them, they do start to come round a little more often. Bus stops are located right outside the hotel and you can walk along the busy intersection over the freeway if your feeling brave enough itll take you about 15 mins, there is a sidewalk but its still a bit tricky as cars still carry on driving even when the walk signs are on! but it's easy to catch the bus and the strip is only one stop away. I think overall this hotel is great for the price and i was more than happy with the service i received whilst staying here. The only issue i have is that, upon check in i was advised that there was a $25 a day security deposit to be taken from my card, I was not made aware of this. There was nothing advised at the time of booking nor was there anything mentioned in the booking terms and conditions, So i hadn't factored this into my hotel cost. I explained that i didnt have enough money for this so the receptionist took $50 cash deposit. I this obviously ate into my budget too. Of course i got it back on check out. But who needs it on the day they're going home?? I think that this needs to be displayed on their terms of booking, as people may end up getting ripped off.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service At Days Inn Wild, Wild West\u201d", "Author": "Francisco S", "ReviewID": "UR123250033", "Content": "I travel on business to Vegas quite frequently & when I do I make it a point to stay at the Days Inn on Tropicana Dr. Robert Ruiz's Staff are a top-notch Team when it comes to making me feel welcome.

Hey Days inn what it the meaning of the free breakfast then? Although it takes 10-15 min to go to NY NY you have to cross busy intersections and pass through some dark and scary spots. Nothing happened to me but be careful. The hotel charges a ~$5 resort fee for nothing. I believe that this fee makes the customer more angry than the hotel rich. I cannot say much about the casino because I haven't played but the game delivered a sad feeling to me. In conclusion, this hotel offers clean and very cheap rooms. That is definitely very good.

I paid $72.17 for a weekend night through hotwire. My room was 703, I parked my car right in front and noticed a dirty t-shirt on the floor in front of our door. My sister didn't want to touch it so she kicked it away from the door. All of a sudden a women (with no teeth and only about 26 years old) ran down from the upper level screaming, \"That's my t-shirt\". My sister apologized but the woman was crazed about the dirty shirt. That incident was frightening. The room was filthy, my family and I did not take off our shoes and placed our bags on a high clothes rack (for fear of vermin/bugs). Do not stay on the ground floor unless you like GIANT cockroaches. The door to the room is about an inch from the floor so cockroaches have easy access. For the short duration we stayed (2 hours) we killed 3 huge cockroaches that just wandered in from under the door. The sheets on the bed were wet! There was a gunshot hole in the ceiling! We also heard our upstairs neighbors fighting and what sounded like wrestling above our heads. The rug was filthy...do not remove your shoes or the soles of your feet will be black. The room was extremely small and the bathroom is a closet. DO NOT STAY here! We also then noticed that this hotel was more of a low budget apartment complex. We checked in and we checked out! There are prostitutes and pimps outside the hotel. There is a Wendy's across the street and my family and I ( I had children with me) saw a Pimp discipline his \"worker\". The entire area (even though it is close to the airport and Vegas strip) is very seedy. The casino is extremely small and OLD! The slot machine images were faded and there was not a good selection of gambling options. I have stayed in hotels/motels before but I was scared for my safety in this place. We checked in and we checked out! They did not issue a refund because it was booked through hotwire. ..BUT they made sure to charge us an additional $5.50 for a hotel service fee. I asked what is this fee for and they said \"security\" . I didn't even argue, I just wanted to get out of there. I will be writing a letter to hotwire for recommending such a cesspool.

At first I didn't expect much, do to the fact that I got a cheap deal. So when I arrived and saw the, outdated, \"motelish\" facade, I thought, oh well, I will get what I paid for; but fortunately I was wrong. Upon checking-in I was greeted by a very friendly and professional clerk (I was so impressed by her outstanding customer service, that I even took the time to read her name tag; her name is Sussie) She made me feel welcome and answered all my questions with a smile on her face. Then I tought, probably she's the exception, but I was wrong again!!! All the staff of the hotel that I interacted with during my stay there (11 nights) were very friendly, courteous, and helpful. The room assigned to me was clean and comfortable. It included free internet. The only drawback was that there were not enough electrical outlets for all my stuff. But no big deal; I just resorted to unplugging the floor lamp, and plugging in the charger to my handycam, hehehe. The hotel contained a swimming pool large enough for me to swim in. I really enjoyed the fact that it was not crowded the times I used it. In fact, many times I had the whole swimming pool to myself. I used to pick up my free breakfast (included) at Denny's (located inside the hotel) and take it to the pool area to eat it there. Oh,and there was also a hot tub by the pool. The next day I went to the small casino to play. It is located next to the check-in area. It has 2 blackjack tables (my game) with minimum $5 bets, a roulette table, and a relatively good number of slot machines. The dealers were very friendly, however some looked depressed due to the fact that there were not too many gamblers on their tables--and thus not too many tips to complement their incomes. It's a shame, because they are really good people. They take their time to learn your name and get to know you better in a personal level. And you get the feeling that they are really rooting for you. After that I decided to hit the Strip, and that's when I formed the only negative opinion about my stay there. Even though the hotel is relatively close to the Strip, I will not recommend for you to walk there. It is a dangerous walk. And I am not refering to crime, I'm talking about traffic. You will be force to cross some very busy avenues, and even highways, where cars seem to be going 60 and 70 mphs. And the fact that there are pedestrian crossing lights on every intersection will not ease your apprehention. So if you're staying there, consider taking a cab or renting a car to move around (which will add to your expense). I ended up doing neither. I walked to the Strip--and back to the hotel--all the time during my stay there. I did it under 108 degrees heat during the day, and deserted sidewalks during the late nights.

My husband and I were put up in the Hampton Inn across the road when a delayed flight kept us in Vegas an extra night. The Hampton Inn doesn't have a casino, we didn't have a car and my husband didn't want to go far, so our options for entertainment were severely limited. We saw the sign for the Wild West Casino and walked over. The casino is very small and dark with a (very) few tables and a small number of machines. We loved it. Really. Why? First, at the bar, I got a large premium draft for $2 (actually, at that price, I got more than one). The machines were (relatively new), the same ones we saw on the Strip. Unlike the Strip, we got great play out of them. Playing the penny machines, we ended up $40.00 that evening, and went down $20.00 the next morning, but we had fun playing for a good amount of time. It's clearly a locals bar: we were too shy to play Blackjack because everyone playing seemed to know one another, but we did not at all feel out of place or unwelcome. The casino reminded me of those you find in small towns throughout the state, like Beatty or Mesquite. Bottom line: it's similar to the casino at the Sahara, though smaller, with a better selection of really cheap, good draft beer, and you can play longer on the same amount of money.

Other than that though, it was just like a motel and we didn't feel very safe at all. I had to get pretty drunk in order to go back there after a night out!

Although the room was a little in need of repair (toilet leaking, doorknob to bathroom loose), it was still a great value for the price paid. I felt safe in the room and was comfortable for the time I was there. Plus, now that the property is a Days Inn, you can expect a higher level of service and quality in the hotel rooms. The one downside to this hotel is the walk to the strip. It is relatively safe during the day but at night, it may be a bit creepy.

Twice I set off a car alarm because I had to slam the door so hard to close it.

The ONLY reason why I stayed at this property was because I was in town for a conference and all of the downtown Phoenix hotels were so OVER PRICED that it was ridiculous. While my stay at this hotel wasn't bad, the only thing it was good for was the price. First of all, the elevators in this hotel were SO SLOW that it was mind boggling. The room was OK, towels were like sand paper and the sleep number control for my bed did not work. The carpet throughout the hotel looked really old, worn and dirty and the gym was a closet with two treadmills (One of which was broken) and no towels to use. Finally, there was a seedy adult boutique on the corner which made the area feel dirty even though I felt completely safe walking around at night. The hotel was convenient to the light rail so getting downtown and to the airport was a breeze but other than that, this hotel was nothing spectacular.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAwful gym - nasty pools - needs another facelift - nice bartender\u201d", "Author": "Greg_H_DC", "ReviewID": "UR127291031", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a week while attending a conference downtown. While the hotel was clean you could tell that they were on a budget when they remodeled the place. The bathroom's had old bathtubs and the new paint didn't come all the way down to the floors. On the website it clearly states that all rooms have upgraded beds, but mine was old, dingy and not very comfortable (I should have asked to switch when I checked in.) Speaking of checking in, when I was checking in (after waiting for the one guy on duty to get off the phone for a good three minutes - which is a lot if you are the only one in the lobby with the only employee in the place - the guy on the phone was offered a lower rate than I was paying - can't you do this from the back office?) I was given little info and sent to my room. If I was paying for this I would have renegotiated or even walked away. I also selected this place due to it's gym (which is an absolute joke - if you are looking for a small room with three antiquated machines that don't even work, this is your place) and the pools are dirty and not very inviting. The only great thing about this hotel is that it's close to the tram (a four minute walk and then a 20 minute ride to downtown) and the bartender. The free breakfast also isn't that bad (although I did just stick with the fruit and toast.) Suggestions for management: upgrade the gym so someone can actually work out there or be truthful on your website about the gym, pool, check-in folks and state of the rooms. While walking to the tram I did see the Extended Stay Deluxe Midtown which looked brand new from the outside, so you may want to check out that place (but again I haven't been or stayed there).", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a spruce up.....\u201d", "Author": "Mike P", "ReviewID": "UR126931485", "Content": "don't get a room anywhere near an elevator.

The courtyard grounds are very nicely landscaped and they have a volleyball court and a childrens' playground. Due to a problem with our room, we actually stayed in two different rooms. The casita rooms on the roof are very nice because they are actually two rooms each with their own flat screen tv, but they are smaller than the regular rooms because of their being two rooms.

Spent 3 nights here due to business meeting. The bed was comfortable enough; tho many of our colleagues actually had Sleep Number beds, we did not. The bathroom was fine - nothing special. Major issues: 1) When we checked in, after going to our room, I callled down to the front desk to request a down pillow. The clerk on duty did not know what a down pillow was...I had to describe a feather pillow! We were alloted only one bar of soap for our entire visit, so had to move it from tub to sink and back. After the first night, all our wash cloths, and complimentary toiletries were not replaced daily, altho sometimes one item might reappear. The worst part of our stay tho, was the room air conditioner. When it is on, it is so loud you cannot hear the television (which has not yet been upgraded to a flat screen). At night the air conditioner is particularly bothersome as the loudness of it wakes you up, which doesn't help you get a good night's sleep. The breakfast buffet that came with our room had no variety whatsoever during the 3 days we were there: terrible biscuits & gravy, dry scrambled eggs, greasy linked sausage, limp bacon, some fresh fruit, yogurt, and sugary cold cereal. The outdoor courtyard looked pretty and had a pool, but the weather was cold and rainy while we were there. We held a morning meeting on Saturday after meeting elsewhere in town for 2 days, but when we needed to find the bathroom for the meeting area, we learned we had to go outside and down a long cold hallway in the rain, to the ladies room. Not good. It was freezing -- only 49 degrees and raining! No warm water in the restroom either. If you have a choice, I'd choose another property nearby -- there was a Holiday Inn Express next door and a very new Extended Stay Suites on the corner across the small intersection.

We arrived at the Radisson in Phoenix, AZ (3600 N 2nd Ave; Phoenix, AZ 85013) on February 13, 2011 and stayed until February 21, 2011. My husband and I travel for a living (on the road 24/7) so we fly our parents in to see us in different cities each year. This year, we booked our room at the Radisson (huge mistake) thinking that it would be a relaxing, upscale hotel. Online it states that every room is equipped with a coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave along with other things. This is important because we bring our own food. Upon arrival at the hotel, my parent's reservations were not found. It took about 30 minutes of phone calls to me and research for the front desk staff to find their reservations. Once in, their room had no washcloths, coffee maker (but the coffee was there), and no mini fridge. They called down to ask for replacement items but they said they were out and they had to stay in this room. For the first few days of our stay we did not have washcloths and housekeeping was extremely rude--I would try to say hi and ask how their day was going and they would speak in Spanish to each other and completely ignore me; then they didn't even show up some days. What topped the experience was two nights before I was scheduled to leave, housekeeping CLEARED MY ROOM! Imagine arriving \"home\" at 2 am to a completely empty room! My retainers, $100 toothbrush, supersized bottle of brand new mouthwash, underwear, bra, etc missing. My key still worked and my room was empty. In conclusion, this was the WORST hotel that I have ever stayed in. I do not look forward to coming back to Phoenix for a week next year and will never stay at a Radisson hotel ever again since my experience with this hotel.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cPoor location\u201d", "Author": "otombeur", "ReviewID": "UR95565210", "Content": "Not the greatest location in town as nothing around.

After checking in we noticed we definitely did not have \"Sleep Number\" beds in our room and i felt the beds were actually sub-standand (hard as a rock). I guess i was wrong to assume that all rooms had the same quality of beds. When i complained the next morning i was told b/c of the lower rate thru Priceline, we were placed in a lower quality room. But the lady at the desk was friendly and happily placed us in a better room. The room was still on the small side (jus enough room to navigate around the beds and desk, def not spacious as pictured as a \"standard room\" on their website) and the TV wasnt the greatest. I thought it was odd to provide a microwave but not a refridgerator. I was told the pools were heated but i dont think so since the water was very cold. On a more positive note, the grounds of the hotel were nice, the rooftop terrance was enjoyable and parking was simple. The lobby was nice but of course first impressions are everything. It's a short walking distance to the Light Rail and a few fast food restaurants. The hotel was somewhat hard to find and there is indeed an adult bookstore on the corner lol. But at no time did i feel unsafe with the area. I might add that this hotel has not always been a \"Radisson\". My friend who moved to Arizona 6 years ago stayed here (under a different name, not a chain) for $39.00 a night while searching for an apartment. It seems they still have alot work to do to bring it up to par with other Radisson Hotels.

I work for the racetrack and come out every April and November from California to cover the races at PIR. We're always put up in this Radisson and I think it's high time we change. In April, I stayed 3 nights (Thurs-Sat). I didn't have much problem with the place, except for the fact it's about half an hour away from the track, but that's not the hotel's fault. When I came back in November, my colleague and I came a day early and had to stay at our own hotel, which we chose to be the Holiday Inn Express in Goodyear (right down the street from the track). We had a lovely stay, comfortable beds, linens and breakfast were all superb. We were sad to leave that hotel and move to the Radisson on Thursday night, but we had no idea how sad we were going to be. Once we left the track and got to the hotel at around 11:30pm Thursday, the front desk clerk asked for our reservation, which had been made for a double room. Of course, there was a problem in the system and it was reserved as a single king room, not exactly the proper sleeping arrangement for coworkers! We told them they made a mistake and needed to get us a double, to which the woman replied they were COMPLETELY booked up, even tho there were only about 20 cars in the parking structure, and they had no rooms open. She said she could leave a note to make sure that tomorrow night we got a double room, but that's the best she could do. I asked if there was a cot or anything I could sleep on, and she suggested I sleep on the ARMCHAIR in the room! After 15 minutes of arguing, she finally magically found a single queen up in the \"cabana\" area that I could have. We took the rooms under the assurance that both were covered by the track and that we would have doubles the next evening, even if we came in at midnight again. My poor colleagues room, the one we were supposed to share, was right behind the elevators and she didn't get a wink of sleep thanks to the sound of them going up and down all night. My room was outside on a patio with a drained pool (all equipment left out by it, very unsightly) and was a handicap accessible room. Not a huge deal, but there was no counter to put anything on in the restroom, just a sink. When I flopped down on the bed, I was exhausted and not happy to hit a concrete slab of a mattress and itchy linens. I got up to take a shower and found the TINY towels to be itchy and rough, leaving a rash as I tried to dry off! The next morning as I was getting dressed my phone rang and it was the same lady from the lobby the night before accusing me of having come down and eaten breakfast without paying! Turns out she called my colleague and accused her too! Neither of us had left our rooms, and for them to call us at 7:30 AM seems a bit early. Yes we were up, but what if we hadn't been? I don't think it's good customer service to call and accuse your guests of something at early morning hours. The next night we came to the lobby and found that SURPRISE, there was no note left, no double rooms available and we had to stay with the current rooms. We decided to just leave well enough alone and be happy to have a bed to sleep in and stopped asking after that night if they had a room open for us. On Saturday night there was a wedding reception being held in the restaurant and the extremely drunken guests were smoking pot in the hallways and rooms and propositioning people, including myself, in the elevator! Then at about 1 AM the bride and groom came out to the rooftop patio and got into a huge argument about who was going to go down to the XXX Shop that is just across the street, then smoked some more pot outside my door. Not exactly a restful nights sleep. I sincerely hope we don't have to stay here again, there is nothing to do nearby, the area is very shady and as two young women, we didn't feel very safe.

Some of the facilities were a little difficult - for example, no indoor restrooms near the meeting rooms and a very small and not terribly convenient restaurant. Food service for the meetings was good, but the variety was a little limited. Regarding the restaurant, it has limited hours, with no lunch hour. Excellent service, very good food, but very limited variety and selection. There are a number of local options for restaurants, though, particularly if you have a car. This location is very convenient. Even in rush hour, it was a short and quick ride to the airport. The location is close to downtown Phoenix, and the commuter rail service is a short walk, if you are so inclined. Parking was adequate, even with a wedding in the hotel during our first night there. Fitness facility was acceptable, and the pool area with some other recreation options is very nice. About the only negative thing is that the signage for the hotel is so small that we had a number of attendees have difficulty finding it. A coworker emailed me very specific directions, so I had no trouble. But I did not see the sign until after I had already parked and walked up to the front door.

The specific reason we chose this place is because the hotels.com rep said they offered shuttles from the airport, train station, & to the port. On the way here we found out this is not the case, they offer no shuttles! Ok so major mistake on the part of hotels.com!!! Then we had booked 2 rooms each with a queen bed & we had again been told by hotels.com that we could have roll away beds for the 2 children in each room. Mistake #2 on their part because apparently the hotel has 3 roll-aways total & they were being used!!! This is where I'm now furious at hotels.com & will NEVEr use them again... But this is also where I become impressed with Candlewood. The staff here was really accommodating & even said that usually they would suggest calling hotels.com & making them find us another place But there is a huge boat show in town?? And apparently they have all of the rooms in town booked up! So the staff found us some air mattresses for the kids & provided plenty of extra bedding to make them as comfy as possible. Overall the hotel seems pretty clean, the room is a good size complete with full fridge & small stove! The bed was super comfy so I got a great sleep too. The hotel is about 15mins from the train station, 10 from the airport, & about 15-20 from the port. All in all the hotel gave me no reason to complain, but I learned that hotels.com will book you any kind of room just to get your $ even if it doesn't have anything you were looking for!!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varazze, Italy", "Title": "\u201cOk.

We always enjoyed the amenities (like the free laundry, morning newspapers and a nice selection of groceries at very reasonable prices). This trip, thanks to Pieralberto and Leslie, we were checked in early as we arrived in Miami at 5:00. Leslie had our room ready and we got some needed sleep. We were able to just complete our business in the next 5 days thanks to the efficient staff who always were able to direct us to where we needed to go; and in keeping our mail and correspondence which we had forwarded in anticipation of our arrival. We changed to Candlewood Suites thanks to the personal attention which the staff has always offered and the added room size, so if you are like us and have lots of purchases or luggage you will not feel cramped and be bumping into everything as in other hotels.

This hotel's first impressions: fairly basic but clean and courteous. And those first impressions are indeed what this hotel is about. Check-in was fast and efficient. My room was on the second of 3 floors. I usually dread being in one of the lower levels of smaller budget hotel properties because of noise from above, but this building is solidly built and noise was never a problem from above, below or through the walls. The room was like a well laid-out bachelor apartment, with a simple but comfy queen bed, flat screen TV with HBO and 40-odd other free channels, DVD player, highly usable kitchenette with clean dishes and utensils, toaster, microwave, and a full-size fridge that was actually cold. Bathroom was perfectly fine and very clean with soft, clean towels and the air-conditioner was quiet and cold. I could see this place as a great place for long-term business-person stays. My own purpose was as a solo traveler in Miami for a golf tournament at Doral, which is a very easy 20 minute walk away. For families, there is a rudimentary, fenced in pool. For fitness buffs, there is a gym on the lower level and a park next door with a nice long jogging path. I really liked the location. Besides being close to Doral, this property happens to be off 87th, which is the last exit on 836 West before the tolls (I hate paying tolls!) and 836 is only a few minutes south. 836 then gets you anywhere fast ... airport in 10 minutes with traffic, downtown in 20 minutes (and $1.25 one-way toll), and SoBe in 25 minutes. So long as you have a car (there is plenty of free parking) and don't mind the industrial park setting, this location can't be beat. Lots of chain restaurants and smaller places all around and a Walmart/Sams Club near 836 for those interesting in stocking up their kitchenette. Final nice touch is the hotel's tuck shop which has a great selection of drinks and snacks. It operates on an honor-basis and the prices are actually really good ($0.50 for a can of soda, $4 for a pint of Haagen Dazs. Only minor beef: free wifi gets really slow during peak evening hours.

The room is a handicap room, so the shower has all the gadgets, but unless you are actually handicap and in need of the assistance, this is not desirable. To make the story short, the furniture is old and beat up, and the carpet was dirty with bits of trash all around the room, but the worst was the bed.

I called the company through which I had booked it and explained the problem, they called the hotel to verify that I had requested another room and she said that I was lying, that she herself had come to the room to inspect it, and that the hotel was sold out. Clearly, all lies. She is really the worst person to have her position. Thankfully I was able to get refunded and re-booked at a much better hotel a couple of blocks away for 10 dollars cheaper.

I am origianlly from Miami and visit as often as possible. I stayed in this extended stay for 1 week, acquired through a Priceline bid. We paid $40 per night. We had no problems with the room or stay there. I will comment that I have been aware tor awhile that when staying at an extended stay, they rarely accomodate more than 2 ppl and if they do, you will be charged extra, even if you got it through Priceline. I read it here. Do your research, people, My complaint is that I believe very strongly that we picked up bed bugs in this hotel. I am just finding them in my bed now, exactly 3 months after my stay, the time it takes for most infestations to begin. We had an exterminator confirm this based on the amount of bugs and time since our visit. Like I mentioned above, I have not traveled AT ALL this year other than that visit. When I return from trips, my luggage sits next to my husband's side of the bed. Guess where we found them? Only on my husband's side of the bed. All these facts add up to confirm my suspicions. I intend to contact the hotel but I don't expect anything... Just in case you don't read the news, getting rid of bedbugs is tricky and expensive. I am hoping it is not too out of control.

Had already stayed on South Beach earlier in holiday so choose here as simply needed somewhere on way back from Keys before going to Everglades. In summary, only stay here if you want somewhere close to the airport. Stayed at 6 different hotels on the holiday in Florida after consulting Trip Advisor and this was unfortunately the only one which was 'average'/ didnt meet expecations. I can only therefore advise caution with any other reviews which say its amazing !! Likes: -Spacious rooms. -Out of town ie near main road network if you are not wanting a central location as eg passing through miami/ or going to airport. -Pool. Negatives: -Difficult to find. Booked direct through Candlewood website. Had instructions on how to find it from their main website but unfortunately the last turn is incorrect. We went the opposite way to the hotel then drove around for 5 - 10 mins before finding it. Note it is near 'La Quinta', another hotel, on an industrial estate location. When we arrived the receptionist was on the phone directing someone else who was lost trying to find it !! -Price: Booked approx 6 months before went through their main website for 129 dollars exl tax then when looked a month before it was 89 dollars on their website. In retrospect after visiting it was overpriced at 129 dollars. -Check in/ deposit: I paid in cash as I had brought dollars with me on holiday but they insisted on taking an additional cash deposit of 25 dollars more as I had paid in cash and not by credit card. I have never encountered such an arrangement elsewhere and though that slightly odd. I did get it back in the morning but it added to the 'industrial estate slightly scary feel about the place. -Location: Its on an industrial estate type setting near the proximity of the airport. Yes, right under the flight path, literally. Whilst I wasnt kept awake, please be aware if you are a light sleeper that this is located on the landing path approx 1 mile from the airport. Also, its a industrial estate type setting so if you are happy literally arriving by car and thats it then its fine. If you prefer being able to walk somewhere then this isnt for you. -Lack of continental breakfast. Only hotel stayed in on this holiday with no breakfast (and for 160 dollars a night when include tax, this should be provided) Hints: Visit the 'refreshment centre' it has free coffee/ milk or essentials to buy if you have forgotten any. The pool is nice but unfortunately loses the sun in an evening. Overall, would i recommend it? Unfortunately on balance I'd have to say no, only because of its location (on a flightpath and an industrial estate).

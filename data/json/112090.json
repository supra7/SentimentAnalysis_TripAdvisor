It was clean, had a microwave and refrigerator and a continental breakfast that included coffee, toast, mini donuts, Twinkies, raisin bran cereal, frosted flakes cereal, milk, and an orange juice drink (like Sunny D or Tang) however there were only two small tables to eat at so you really had to take everything back to your room to eat. The beds were comfortable. It was VERY convenient to all of the Disney parks and was very affordable. I say it was average because there were a few times I didn't feel completely safe (because of some of the individuals staying there). I realise this isn't really the hotel's fault but it is simply my observation. I stayed with my two children, ages 16 and 13, but I probably would not stay there again unless my husband was with me (and I am used to taking care of myself).

A shot is what I felt I needed after being in this place! My first tip should have been when I called and asked about the property, they asked what type of hotel I was used staying at, and I gave them an example of another low cost facility we frequent and they were like \"oh\". Oh? Seems that the other place they considered a higher grade than their property \"???\" Ok I took the chance and when I pulled up it was weathered and needing some sprucing up but I'm trying to be positive! We get to our 1st room located on the ground floor and the smell of mold and mildew was pretty bad but hey it's Florida it might just need to be aired out (still trying to be positive) sat down and noticed the dresser had 3 drawers of one color and one different color and handle odd but hey I can deal with it. Go to the bathroom and there is mold growing in the corner that was over a half inch in height! I turned around and left my wife has to go so she is going to take a chance well there was live roaches in the tub (yeah plural) and there was some other little round looking bugs on the toilet paper. We explained the situation the front and they gave us a room on the second floor. Room #2 Looked alot better but still smelled moldy just not nearly as bad but bad enough we all started to get a headache. Oh and did I mention more bugs? The elevator smelled so strong of grease and hydraulic fluids that by the second ride down we all had a burning in the back of our throats that lasted even after we left the property. The front desk was accommodating and refunded my money when I explained about what we had found. They did not seem the least bit surprised they just were like ok not even we will look into it or whatever. Now the kicker is I find out later that my DD would not even bring in her beloved bear due the conditions of the room she was afraid of what might happen to it. Wow a kid is will stay because they have to but would not put their stuffed animal through staying there for fear of it getting hurt. If I had know this when we at room #1 I would have walked away without even asking about another room my family and their health is worth more than any good deal on a room. As a side note due to the lack of a room, I wound up visiting 17 hotels in Orlando some good some bad and will be adding reviews to some of those soon.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olive Branch, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cBetter to go with something else\u201d", "Author": "Tyler B", "ReviewID": "UR126302227", "Content": "The inside of the rooms is decent.

I really wanted to like this; not only is it cute, but I believe it's a small, independent place, not a chain. First I'll give the positives: Location: it is right off of 192 in Kissimmee, easy to get back and forth to Disney World; a Walmart very close by; many family-friendly chain restaurants nearby, a Publix, Walgreens and a CVS also close. Price: very budget-friendly. Cleanliness: spotless, not a bug or stray hair in sight (and dh and I always check the matresses first). The matress itself was very comfortable too. Parking: great; right outside our room, and for 2nd floor units, there's an elevator. We didn't use the t.v., although it looked fairly new for a non flat-screen. Lighting in the room was average for hotels; just enough to make you think it's ok until you try to read. Now the negatives: old, shabby and in need of repair, not to mention updating. The \"mini-suite\" was nothing more than a standard motel room, with two beds switched out for a king-size bed, and a half-wall separating the bed from the sofa in a pathetic attempt to make the room feel more functional; it did nothing but make it tinier than it already was, I haven't been in such a small room since I visitied Manhattan, NYC. Our dresser was missing several pieces of hardware; the table and chairs provided in the room looked well-used - finish chipped, upholstery torn, chairs wobbly. The floor (carpet in most, tile in the bathroom area) was dirty, my feet got black just after a little while walking around barefoot. I had to use a piece of luggage as a bedside table. The inside of the dorm-sized fridge was cracked with insulation visible. The wifi was nonexistent. My husband finally took his laptop out to the car to pick up the signal; I just gave up and tried to read a book. The toilet-roll holder was mounted to a piece of plywood which was nailed to the wall. Same for the clothes-rod in the \"closet\". The shower curtain felt like it came from the dollar store. The room smelled musty; thank goodness I had a candle to burn to combat the oder. The a/c was completely inefficient. With that half-wall, the cold air couldn't circulate to the other side where the bed is, and we were too warm all night. We didn't go to the pool, because there were NO chairs there! The motel itself is set back from the highway, but it's a bit confusing to enter the parking lot. You have to first turn into a strip-mall, then go to the end of it as if you're driving around to the rear, then you finally come upon the motel itself. The continental breakfast? A joke! Two kinds of cereal in dispensers, white bread for toast, a communal bowl of margarine, and another communal bowl of jam. The coffee was more like hot water that had a brown crayon passed through it. The fruit was plastic! (Why bother even putting that out?) The juice was actually a juice-drink, probably was only an orange-flavored beverage like Kool-Aid, tsk, a real sin in Florida. And last but not least, there were only two chairs! I guess the other guests knew not to come! Definitely just a place to sleep, but no more for us, when 192 is lined with other places with similar prices. What I want to know is what kind of camera they used to take the pictures that are on the website and the brochure, because they make that place look good, purple paint notwithstanding!", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAlways Friendly and welcoming\u201d", "Author": "Melanie M", "ReviewID": "UR117824746", "Content": "We stayed here in August.

Good for buying Disney souvenirs (cheapest and better than those \"1.99 t-shirts\" stores which have NOTHING for 1.99!) - very friendly staff and night manager especially, who helped me in advance for my late (past 12 am) arrival! (exception was one day staff who had ignored me when she was counting cash out of the till and was talking on the phone with her friend/family...but overall staff services is good! - close to lots of good places to eat, and 7-elevens, and is a really easy drive to Disney plus the airport - outdoor pool in the parking lot was fun and had lots of lounge chairs. but it had a lot of bugs, so we had to clean it ourselves first. Not so good things/things to be aware of - a little on the \"musky\" smell side. Fine if you don't have allergies. - get the hair dryer from the front desk. the first one I borrowed didn't work but I returned it for a working one. - internet is free; it isn't the greatest but it works... in certain rooms. Make sure you ask for a room where the signal is good if you have plans to go online. - there is a free continental breakfast from 7-9am but when I was there there was just toast, those tiny donuts, 2 types of cereal, milk, fake Orange Juice, coffee.... so it's fine if you just need a quick bite before heading out but boring if you are staying for more than a day. Seating area only has 4 chairs haha. Overall if you're not picky and you literally just need a bed and basic stuff, this place is fine. You will have to deal with potential issues with your room and relocate (I had: non-working Internet, a faulty door lock, both on separate days) but you can save a lot of money.

I spent Christmas and New Year's there with my wife, my two nieces (11 years old), and our baby boy (11 months old). The hotel is nothing outstanding, but the PRICE, LOCATION, and SERVICE are absolutely a HUGE PLUS. The owner and his employees went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and happy. Since the moment I made the reservations by phone to our last day there, they treated us with so much friendliness and warmth. They put a crib in our room (NO EXTRA CHARGE). It was old but in good shape and our son totally loved it. We had a small room and we were tight in space, but we managed. After all, we were there to see Mickey Mouse at the parks, we never intended to spend time at the hotel. The room was almost perfect. The first room we tried, smelled weird and they switched us immediately to another with a better carpet. Besides, the bed was terrible, but once again, the owner immediately switch matresses... they did everything to please us. The pool looks clean. We did not try it just because the weather was too cold. But I'm sure in Spring or Summer you can jump there after visiting the parks to refresh yourself before going to bed. You need to cross the parking lot to get to the pool, that's kind of bizarre, but I think it's worth it. The location is wonderful. We were close enough to return to the room some days to take a nap before returning to the parks rested. it is right in the middle of this long street filled with restaurants and shops. Less than a block away you have a nice and cheap Chinese Buffet and a Cici's Pizza. They offer a simple breakfast (included in the price) with milk, fake-juice, cereals, bread, jelly, and coffee. More than enough to start our day and get going. One more time, the staff was so alert about anything we needed, and they kept cleaning the breakfast area every few minutes. You can eat in your room or in a small sitting area. We had a fridge and a microwave in the room. Very handy, we prepared sandwiches and had dinner there. If you want to save money in a big way, and you are ready to accept a frugal life for a few days, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you have money to spend, or you're too picky, go somewhere else. You will not like this place. Even though it is so inexpensive, the owner manages to keep nasty people out. There are many families with children and the environment is really nice.

I had a problem with the key in my jeep and the lady behind reception came out and helped me. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. I had asked for a room on an upper floor and that is what I got - Room 350. It is a mini king suite with a half wall dividing the sleeping area from the sitting area. The sitting area had a two seater couch which I think may have made into a bed , a standard lamp and coffee table. There was a long wooden piece of furntiure with drawers for clothes which had a large TV which could face either the sitting area or the bedroom area. I also had a fridge microwave and coffee maker. There was also a nice round table and two chairs. The swimming pool area was clean and the loungers comfortable. It was quite busy owing to the Daytona Beach Nascar event over the weekend but even with that I didnt notice any rowdy residents. As previous reviewers had mentioned the breakfast area is very small, however, as my room and I suspect most the rooms had a nice round table and two chairs it was nicer to eat in the room anyway - there was tea coffee (Caf and decaf) Orange Juice and lemonade - three types of cereal with milk - bread for the toaster and some sweet donuts etc. Location is also very good - the motel is between Marker 10 and 11 on HWY 192 - the Disney exit is Marker 6 - there was a 7 Eleven right next door and a Publix just before Marker 11. I also went for an Airboat ride which is at Boggy Creek which was just at the end of Ponciana (Ponciana was the intersection just at the corner. All in all would recommend it but having read some of the negative reviews - would remind readers that is is not 5 star - nor does it pretend to be - be realistic in your expectations and you wont be disappointed. For the price I paid I think it was great value for money, anyone I spoke to was friendly both staff and customers - all in all great value for the money and I would stay there again.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cClean, Friendly staff - Great value\u201d", "Author": "Shadohart", "ReviewID": "UR5503847", "Content": "We spotted this hotel on one of our other trips (we go every couple of weeks) and I forgot about it till I found it again on this site.

Irlo Bronson Highway for the last 6 years. Most of the reviews I saw were from 2005 and before. This motel has been on the upswing since then. They sold the other Magic Castle they owned and put the money into remodeling this one. New beds, new bathroom fixtures (in some rooms), and repaired/remodeled the elevator, etc. Unfortunately, the owner also painted it a purple color! It recently has changed owners again. The new owner has continued fixing up the place, the rooms, and again remodeled the inside of the elevator. He has really fixed up the lobby and the continental breakfast area. He has also put in pop/ice machines on all the 3 floors. I recently stayed there from Feb 11 to Feb 17, 2006 and paid $34.99/night. The next week I stayed at my nephew's time-share. But we again stayed at the Magic Castle on Sunday, February 26, 2006 for $39.99/night. The pictures on their website are accurate ones of the place. I found nothing wrong with my room. The bathroom was clean and the towels were sparkling white. Everything worked fine. My room this time and every time, I have stayed at the Magic Castle has always been more than suitable to eat in and very clean. The maid came in daily to clean and vacuum. Of course, I always tip the maids, as should everyone. If you look at the website pictures, you will see the breakfast area, which is quite nice and is on two long tables with another table holding the condiments, the paper plates, and plasticware. There also was an area for a couple to sit at and eat in the breakfast area but I found it much nicer to go back to my room to eat. There is a quiet pond on the west side of the motel and another quiet pond and street behind the motel. This keeps the place relatively quiet. A few times, guests have been louder than I like but this is when they are going into their rooms and the noise is short. I have been at more expensive motels and have the same type of noise. I feel that no matter where you stay, you will always find someone talking louder than they should. Magic Castle also has three convenient roads in which to drive to Walt Disney World - Highway 192, Osceola Parkway, and Highway 535. One of my pictures shows these roads. The pictures I have posted were taken before 2004 and before the remodeling. The pictures on the website show the new bedspreads and the new sink fixture. Not all rooms have this new sink fixture. I prefer the old ones that have a counter. To tell the truth,I would prefer that this motel be one of my \"secrets\" as I like this place a lot. Some people may have had an unfortunate experience but I can tell you I never had and I have been going there for many years.", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, ga", "Title": "\u201cHorrific dump!\u201d", "Author": "helenvacation", "ReviewID": "UR4499095", "Content": "We booked this place on the way down via the travel cupon book, and should have known better.

As in prior descriptions, the rooms are standard, small etc. The beds were so bad that one night, I slept on the floor. We asked for an extra pillow on the first night, and never saw it. The toilet and tub were clean, but the base of the tiolet, outside of the tub and inside of the bathroom door were covered in what appeared to be vomit from a previous guest. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they cleaned it up some what. The room smelled like wintergreen, the face of the A/C fell off the first night and was never changed, and the ice bag was never never replaced. Large patched areas on the walls, just makes the place look like a dump. Breakfast was standard fare, but served on a small card table with no place to eat. The rooms were not clean enough to eat in, so we ate in the parking lot. This is a below budget hotel.

I prebooked 2 rooms before I left the U.K. in case they were full, as in the past, the rooms soon went due to the fact of it being a cheap but cheerful place to stay. We arrived at the end of April to be confronted by a Barnie purple building, what a disasterous colour, when previously it had been a pretty pink fairy type castle. We were given 2 rooms on the ground floor next door to one another, ours had an adjoining door to another room, where the smoke from there poured into ours, making sleeping a sickening experience. ( these were both non smoking rooms ) our daughter's room was located next to the elevator and she had to put up with it constanltly \" dinging\" and also no daylight due to the room being under the stairs. The noise of other guests during the night was unbearable, and was so bad that police were involved. We left for a quiet restful week on the Gulf coast, and then returned to the Magic Castle for the last 2 days before returning home. Thinking it couldn't be as bad as the previous stay, we had 2 more adjoining rooms on the 3rd floor, what a mistake, sound travels up!!!! the pool was in full use in the early hours of the morning of what seemed liked drunken kids ( where was the security ) Although the rooms were supposed to have all been renovated, ours certainly weren't, we were given a microwave with no available wall plug, so you had to lift it onto the dresser and unplug one of the light fittings. The bath was a disgrace with some really awfull looking stains, and the room itself was shabby. My daughters room was in the same shabby state with the TV cable socket hanging off the wall. The pool needs a complete renovation,all the concrete was patchy, cracked and dirty and the sun loungers ( all 3 of them ) needed to be put in the nearest garbage.

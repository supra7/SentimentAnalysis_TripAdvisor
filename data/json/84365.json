When I called to discuss ways to remedy the situation, the owner was fiercely argumentative and wouldn't even provide simple information like confirming which travel website I booked the hotel from, which would help me independently resolve the charge issue. What was really disturbing was that the owner actively lied to me in an attempt to provide an excuse as to why she couldn't even attempt to consider a refund. Her main claim was that the hotel was at capacity and they were actively turning away potential customers. This is likely to be false because, believing that I didn't have a reservation in the area, I searched around for a hotel room myself the day of, and there were plenty of vacancies in the area. So in lieu of having real customers, the hotel decided to charge me for a reservation I never actually made. Aggravating it all, I only learned of the charge later when I went over my credit card statement; no bill or receipt or phone call or anything from the hotel itself, just a mysterious charge. In short, this hotel may a fine place to stay but if you have any issues with your stay be prepared for ridiculous, overly defensive and argumentative customer service.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cI like this place, even though its a simple motel.\u201d", "Author": "Boutiqueseeker", "ReviewID": "UR116095272", "Content": "Okay the breakfast is awful and the blanket on my bed had a hole it in but I really like this place and have stayed here three times now. Partly its because the location is really good, but mainly because all the rooms look onto a grass courtyard with a fountain and plants, rather than a concrete carpark like all the other motels Ive stayed in here. So that makes the place feel like a tiny refuge from LA's urban craziness. Plus the internet is fast, works 95% of the time, and is free, it comes with flat screen TVs and the room rate is cheaper than Travel Lodge - even if you have to add the cost of buying your own breakfast elsewhere. So Id recommend this place (just get breakfast down the road in Venice!)", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot safe, poor service, free breakfast had almost nothing\u201d", "Author": "SP_travel35", "ReviewID": "UR115377253", "Content": "We didn't feel safe because the room we got didn't have a safety chain in the door.

Great place to stay for the money! Fine location -- especially if you like Mexican food. Close to L.A.'s west side neighborhoods as well as LAX and the Pacific Coast Highway and I-405. The staff appreciate your business and keep the property clean. There's a nice grassy courtyard that they keep up, that makes it nice. The rooms are fine. And on my second stay a few months later, I got a nicely renovated room. (I saw an insect once on a previous stay, and when I reported it to the manager, she took it seriously and gave me the impression they would respond immediately with their exterminator.) They provide attentive, friendly service. It's not a luxury hotel, but for this type of property, it's a wonderful bargain.

I may or may not stay there again, and the same goes for recommending it to a friend. Over all it was an alright experience at a price I was willing to pay. Pros: Affordable price, located within miles of most of our attractions: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Universal Studios. The room was clean, a nice AC/Heating unit, the window opened, TV, large sized mini fridge, microwave, nice shower head with good pressure and multiple settings. Neutral: The area of town. It doesn't look the best, but there are no bars on the windows of homes, and I felt pretty safe. Cons: 1. The parking was AWFUL! There are not enough spaces for starters, and the spaces they do have are very tight. You not only have to back out of the parking spot, but the entire length of the parking area, onto a very busy and crowded side street. The parking on the side street is mostly occupied by locals parking in front of their homes. Our 2nd night we had to park on the busy main street, which we could not see from our room. It was a little nerve wracking, but in the end it worked out okay. 2. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. That includes sofa beds and air mattresses.

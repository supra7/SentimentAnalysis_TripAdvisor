We booked our room using Priority Club points. We booked a king-size suite and requested a crib for our 15 month old son. After a very long flight it was really nice to be picked up by the kind shuttle bus driver & taken the hotel. Probably one of the friendliest people we'd ever encountered, he helped us bring our bags in (with our long flight/jet lag & late hour it was definitely appreciated!). We checked into our room & requested some milk for our son - there in a flash. We also inquired if the restaurant was serving food & indeed it was :) We went to our room to put our son to bed and the crib (requested in our booking) wasn't in our room, but we called reception & it was brought really quickly by the very kind maintenance crew man. He even brought us extra sheets because he very honestly said, 'I wasn't sure what you needed.' We got ourselves situated - our room was great as we were able to put our son to sleep in the bedroom (in his crib) & shut the door, then sit out in the sitting room/lounge area. My husband went to get food from the restaurant for our dinner as it was about 9:30 PM now. He got us a salad and one of the yummiest Turkey Focaccia sandwiches we'd ever had!!! So, if you are at the hotel, I'd recommend that sandwich for sure. The salad was so-so, edible, but nothing to get excited about, but the sandwich, wow! Then, we retired for the evening. Had a great sleep & woke up in the AM, then walked up the road a bit to have breakfast at an IHOP (International House of Pancakes). A nice stroll up there & back, then we left the hotel to head back to the airport to pick up our rental car for our stay. The staff at the hotel, Zachary in particular, were really helpful and nice in letting us check out a bit late as our son was napping. We would happily stay there again if needing an airport hotel in Phoenix. Also, (although we didn't take advantage of it as we were off to visit with family after our first night there) I would expect it's a very convenient spot to explore downtown Phoenix.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Campbell", "Title": "\u201cHotel in general\u201d", "Author": "Viviann F", "ReviewID": "UR127999841", "Content": "Hotel accommodations were very nice.

Overall I had a very pleasant experience and found the hotel exceeded expectations in many respects \u2013 in particular for a Holiday Inn property that charged a very reasonable daily rate. The hotel has clearly been recently renovated and both (i) the main lobby/restaurant/bar area and (ii) the guest rooms have a modern sleekness to them that, again, was much nicer than expected. A minor detail to be sure, but the beaded curtain in the lobby that separates the bar area from the main lobby is nothing short of impressive. There is also a small Starbucks installation in the lobby which, from my perspective, could not have been better. A nod to the staff at the Starbucks who were particularly friendly throughout my stay. To the rear of the main lobby there is a small, functional business center. Only one computer could print, however, and the windows-based system offered only the barest of functionality. As an example, I needed to scan a document to PDF and this could not be done \u2013 not through the business center, nor through the hotel front desk. This was terribly inconvenient and just a little too 2005 frankly. Service upon check-in and at check-out, as well as overall, was very good and hotel staff were always polite and professional. One evening, when I asked the hotel\u2019s reception to call me a taxi, they kindly offered up a free trip in their hotel shuttle which was appreciated. Although I\u2019m not positive, based on the layout of the hotel, I suspect that each of the rooms is in a fact a two-room suite. The suites themselves are modern, relatively well appointed and very clean. The main living room area included a sofa, decent sized flat-screen TV, a small kitchenette (with a bar fridge, sink, microwave and coffee maker) and a work space with a simple, but very functional, two-tier desk. The bedroom featured a king size bed, another flat-screen and in-room sink. The individual built-in reading lamps were a nice touch as well. The bathroom itself was very small but \u2013 and this is hugely important to me \u2013 it was IMMACULATE. Crisp white from corner to corner and top to bottom. This was, without a doubt, one of cleanest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen. That alone made this stay enjoyable. The view, however, from my 4th floor suite was bleak \u2013 overlooking a parking lot and the rear of the hotel. Other than a quick sandwich at lunch on my first day, I did not dine in the hotel\u2019s main restaurant although the separate breakfast restaurant offered a nice selection (including a breakfast buffet), a number of healthy options, efficient service and cheap prices. Every morning I was greeted politely by the waitstaff and was them promptly asked \u201cWill you be using any coupons today?\u201d Having never stayed at a Holiday Inn before I felt a little out of the loop \u2013 where do people get all these breakfast coupons and why didn\u2019t I have any? This remains an unsolved mystery! I used the fitness center on three or four occasions. It was fine. It is equipped with two elliptical machines and four treadmills \u2013 one of which did not work all week. There was also a work-out bench, some free weights, a yoga mat and an exercise ball. I usually had the place to myself other than on one morning. Not a big deal at all, but the TV in the gym should really have better reception and channel availability. I did not use the main pool/hot tub area although having walked by it several times per day, it looked very clean and well maintained. The outdoor lounging areas within the hotel\u2019s courtyard are also a very nice touch. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise in terms of both quality of stay and value proposition. Considering that this is an airport Holiday Inn, the size and quality of the suites, I really don\u2019t think you could expect anything more.

The property is really well manicured, with a \"spa\", \"resort\" feel. There are fire pits outside, and cozy areas to sit. I only wish we had arrived earlier (and we weren't leaving so early in the AM) so we could have enjoyed the property. The rooms are clean and VERY spacious. The format of the room reminded me of the Embassy Suites, whereas you have a sitting area in the front; the bedroom in the back. The lighting in the bedroom was the best I have ever experienced at a 3-4 Star hotel. We were actually able to provide \"intimate\" mood lighting via the small light fixtures alongside the bed. The bathroom/shower area is small. But what we liked is there were two sinks in the room, both outside of the tub/toilet area. So there was plenty of room/space for two people to get ready. I would recommend asking for a room away from the street side of the building. The only complaint I had was when I called for the shuttle to pick me up upon my return to Phoenix (I left my car at the hotel for two days). I had to call back twice, as I was placed on hold for nearly 5 minutes. When the person at the front desk asked to place me on hold again, I said, \"No, I have already been on hold and I just want to know where to get the shuttle back to the hotel.\" The person who answered the phone said, \"Well, if you'd just be patient, I'll tell you.\" I found this to be inappropriate. I was going to let it go but this same person told the shuttle driver to pick me up at Terminal 3, NOT Terminal 4 where I was standing. So I ended up waiting for 30-35 minutes for the shuttle. I let the manager know, and he could NOT have been kinder and immediately called this person into his office as he did not condone the behaviour of his employee. Customer service is definitely a top priority for this hotel. The bar area is nice. We were surprised they did not have limes when we ordered a vodka tonic. We did not have a chance to try the restaurant. The only \"down\" side is the layout of the hotel is a bit confusing; especially when you are arriving late and a bit weary. Finding our room took longer than expected! But it allowed us to peruse the grounds; all well worth it!

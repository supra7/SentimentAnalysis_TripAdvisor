The Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Airport is such a hotel. My stay got off to a very inauspicious start when I arrived on a Thursday night. I used the courtesy phone by the airport baggage carousels to let the hotel know I was ready and waiting. \"We'll send somebody right over,\" said the gentlemen on the other end of the line. I waited on a brisk cold night as other hotel shuttle vans came and went like clockwork, until the van from the Crowne Plaza finally arrived an hour and four minutes later. The personable driver said he had never received a call about my being there waiting. Luckily, two other hotel guests had arrived and called for the shuttle. Otherwise, I might still be waiting. When I signed in, I told the desk clerk of my exceedingly long wait. He said he would look into it and find out why. The next morning I asked at the desk if they had figured out what happened. Nobody seemed to know a thing about it, but they did a call a manager to discuss the matter with me. That manager, whose name appears frequently with management responses on these pages, was quite apologetic, and offered me a complimentary breakfast (which would value my waiting time somewhere near minimum wage). She then offered a significant room rate reduction. My charitable guess is that whoever answered the phone got very busy right after hanging up and forgot to page the shuttle driver. The other notable problem at the Airport Crowne Plaza is that it is directly under the flight path to the airport, which is a major FedEx hub. FedEx still flies many Boeing 727 aircraft, one of the noisiest planes in the sky, even when equipped with a hush kit. From 11:30 p.m. to 2 or 3 a.m., planes come screaming in for a landing every minute or two, so close I felt as if I could touch them from my fifth floor room. Prevailing winds and the runway arrangement at Indianapolis airport dictate that most of the time, planes will be landing right over the hotel. The hotel thoughtfully provides earplugs, but they are they aren't very effective. Mercifully for me, FedEx all but shuts down on Friday and Saturday nights, so sleep was much less disturbed those nights. The hotel itself is a beautiful building, with interesting architecture. Staff throughout the hotel, including the servers in the hotel restaurant and bar, were friendly, good-humored, and courteous. My spacious room was immaculately clean, properly made up each day. Wired or wireless internet is complimentary. I was at the hotel for a service club training event. It included two breakfasts and a lunch served buffet-style, and dinner served banquet style. The staff assigned to our group were a delight, friendly and efficient. The buffet meals were delicious with a wide choice of foods. As a vegetarian, however, I was disappointed with my banquet plate: rice, broccoli and a broiled half tomato. Not much protein in that meal. Our whole large group was checking out just before noon on Sunday. We would have overwhelmed the shuttle van's capacity to get us to the airport in a timely fashion. The hotel very courteously and thoughtfully arranged for a shuttle bus from a neighbouring Holiday Inn to supplement their van. It's a nice hotel with a really good staff. It's a shame my visit got off to a bad start. I would certainly give them another chance the next time I visit Indianapolis.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cdecent hotel, but right under flight path\u201d", "Author": "megria", "ReviewID": "UR119729655", "Content": "This hotel is directly under the flight path of FedEx and maybe other planes.

I was very pleased with my room and the entire decor. I relaxed about an hour or so before my coworkers called me down to meet them at the bar. By the time I arrived at the bar, all of my coworkers had alcoholic beverages. One of my coworker got up from the bar for me to sit there. I sit there for 10 minutes. And another 10 minutes. And another 10 minutes before Michelle opened her mouth to ask if I wanted anything. I was the only black in the bar and not once did she ask me what I would like to drink. I noticed that Michelle asked other patrons at the bar and in the lounge for drinks. She even waited on a patron sitting next to me! Finally when my coworker asked for their checks (30 minutes later), Michelle finally asked if I wanted anything. I replied, \"Yes, 30 minutes ago.\" I refused to believe that Michelle did not see me sitting at the bar.

The parking lot is ample and our cars were parked there 26 nights with no problems. There is easy access to I-70 and I-465/I-74. The wireless is really fast and easy to access (no passwords to remember). There are courtesy vans which will take you to the airport or nearby restaurants. There is Denny's, Steak and Shake, Fazoli's, etc. all not far away. Regarding the airplanes, some of the time we would hear them (and see them up close and personal) but they are going so fast, it is over quickly. The staff is friendly and helpful, especially Casey, Corey, Alex, and Mary.

I called the generic reservations line and was told by a gentleman we would be most comfortable at the Crowne Plaza due to recent renovations and close proximity to the zoo (our other option was the holiday inn). He gave me a confirmation number and I confirmed verbally the name and location of our hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, I noticed two ladies working at the front desk. One was checking in customers and the other seemed occupied with the phone and/or paperwork (not sure what exactly). I waited my turn and then met Gloria. She asked me my name and could not find my reservation. She asked for my confirmation number (which I had mistakenly left at home over 3 hrs away). She told me there was nothing she could do without that number. I understand it was my fault that I did not have that number, but it seemed as if she wanted nothing to do with me at this point. I explained to her the conversation I had with reservations. She then stepped to another phone to make a call when a man approaches the counter dressed in business attire. The other woman at the desk drops what she is doing to assist him (when I had waited before). So apparently you need to wear business clothes to be more quickly helped there. When Gloria returned she told me my reservation was at the holiday inn at a different location. She did not offer to help us in any other way even though the mistake was made on the reservations part (holiday inn and crowne plaza are the same company and use the same system for reservations). It was her general attitude and demeaning nature that really had hurt my feelings. She wanted no part of helping me. I then asked her if she could give me directions (since she was not going to offer to do anything else) and she told me she did not know how to get there. She turned to another guy that walked up and asked him but at this point I told her I'd use my phone and figure it out. I went out to the car and told my husband who went back in and got the manager. He apologized and did give us directions to the holiday inn. By now too much time had gone by and once we traveled to the holiday inn (about 15-20mins away). We were unable to go to the zoo (we'd only have 2 hrs there). I felt this mistake was made on their reservations line and they made no effort to make up for it. Not impressed to say the least.

My requirements were a pool and proximity to the airport. After checking out other reviews, I chose CP. I called CP Friday evening to inquire about the availability of a computer/printer and the young man who answered the phone was extremely polite. And on Saturday, our day of check-in, we were running behind and I knew we wouldn't be arriving at the hotel until very late. Again I called and again experienced a friendly staff to assured me that it was no problem that we would be arriving late. We finally arrived at the hotel sometime after 11 p.m. We did have to wait while the lady at check-in dealt with a couple phone calls, but once she turned her attention to us our check in was pleasant and efficient. The lady who brought up an extra blanket to our room was very nice, as well. The hotel itself is attractive, and the pool and hot tub area appeared very clean, though we were unable to use them as we had arrived so late. They have rooms with balconies that overlook the pool area/large hotel lobby, however we did not have one of these rooms. They have easily accessible computers with a printer, a lot of meeting/seating space. There is an interesting area on the 5th floor, with chairs and loveseats, and at first glance the area seems to be tastefully decorated, if not a bit outdated. But close up the chairs and loveseats are very worn and shabby. But it is a nice area to sit and also overlooks the large lobby. I am sure with time that the furnishings in this area will be updated, as the rest of the hotel was pretty nice. Our room was small, which was expected, it suited our purposes as a place to catch some sleep and be near the airport. The room decor was attractive, and the bathroom seemed nice, but the tub was small and the showerhead was low (I'm short and it still seemed low). I didn't see anything that was befitting of their \"Bath Experience\" or whatever was touted in their info book, and other than the very nice bathroom counter/sink area, it was pretty basic as hotel bathrooms go. UNLESS the special bathrooms are in a luxury suite or something, but I can not attest to that. They have a nicely stocked snack/necessity \"shop\", and they do provide items like razors and toothbrushes in case you forget to pack them. The physical of the location, while close enough to the airport - and they do offer shuttle service - leaves A LOT to be desired. The entire surrounding area was run down(I assume this has been the case since the airport moved), there was some weird \"road construction\" going on...and make sure you don't turn BEFORE the hotel. Drive on up past the front of the hotel to access the parking lot. The road situation was confusing and not well marked, the city/county should do something about that. Now, I want to address some of the previous reviews concerning a lack of restaurants in the hotel vicinity. I suggest you learn to use Google Maps! There are plenty of places to eat within a several mile radius, if you have a car and you don't want to eat at the hotel. Also - I did not hear one plane the fly over during our visit, which was a Saturday night.

I was surprised to find there was no refrigerator or microwave, but there was a mini coffee pot and a table to set up some snacks for the kids. The kids from all four families (about 12 kids) swam the majority of the evening (from 7-11 pm). When the hotel staff shut the pool at 11, the kids came back to the room, but began to limp. One little boy complained that it felt as if he had a bunch of splinters in his feet. As we sat him down and propped his feet up, we saw he had little red blisters on all of his toes, and his big toes were beginning to bleed. At that moment, two brothers from another family realized they had trailed blood all the way from the pool to the room. We sat them down and saw blisters on all their toes, and their big toes were literally pouring blood. My three boys all had blisters on every toe and one of my sons had one that had begun to bleed when he got into the room. We went to the hotel front desk to ask for bandaids or access to their first aid kit, and to find out if there was any glass reported in their pool, and they rudely said they didn't provide any band aids and said that no one else was having any problems. After a little more complaining on our part, a customer service rep came to our room and saw 6 boys in our room, holding blood soaked towels against their feet. She said she only had four bandaids and that was all she could do. She then proceeded to try to take chairs away from our hotel room that we had borrowed earlier (with front desk permission) from a conference room near the front desk. She showed no concern for the kids who were injured, and too much concern over the use of chairs.

The Green Line bus does run from the airport to the downtown area, but it's $7 each trip and then you still have to wait for the hotel shuttle to take you to the stop or pick you up. ALSO, and this is important: the website says that the airport shuttle is 24-hour, but in reality it only runs every half-hour on off hours (like very late at night or early in the morning), so unless you plan accordingly, you run a very real risk of missing a flight if you happen to be trying to get to the airport at, say, 5am!!!! Our room was very nice, very clean, and exceedingly comfortable. The shower was GREAT, the mini coffee-maker in the room was most appreciated, and the lobby was very pretty. However, the front-desk staff was less than helpful on most occassions, the room service was severely overpriced for the quality of food that we got, and if you're in one of the rooms toward the lobby-end of the halls, the noise from the pool can be excessive. All in all, our stay wasn't terrible, but as the week wore on we started to get frustrated with the inconvenience of the location, especially with having to tote around lots of heavy stuff for the Con.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "midwest USA", "Title": "\u201cgood in a pinch\u201d", "Author": "AnotherDawn", "ReviewID": "UR74801232", "Content": "Spent 4 nights here.

The airport shuttle employee acted like no big deal and made us carry our luggage to the check-in desk to talk to the manager on duty. After waiting for approx. 5-10 minutes for her to arrive she said there was nothing she could do about this matter!!!! I asked her when our car had been vandalized and she told me our car was one of three cars that this happened to. We asked her to call the police and while we waited for them to arrive she left us, not offering to do anything! After the kind policeman told us this happens alot in this area, we tried to find the manager again to ask her for a shop-vac so we could vacuum out piles of shattered glass on our front seats and floor. She said she would check for one and after 20 minutes went by, she could not help us with this either? When I asked for another manager to talk to she told me they would not be available until Sunday or Monday which she did provide their names to me. I then asked her if she could provide a complimentary room to us for our trouble and figure out how we were going to drive home 3 hours north without a window in 20* weather - of course she could not help us again and wanted us to pay a discounted rate - OMG!!!!! So then I asked her for some cardboard & heavy masking tape to make a passenger window to attempt to drive home ( waited another 15 minutes for these). While my husband almost froze to death constructing this window out of nothing, I asked her for at least a broom & dust pan to sweep all of the glass out of my car. She provided these too after 10 minutes of waiting and by this time I have FIRE coming out of my ears in extreme anger!!! Wouldn't you by now??? I then asked her to personally follow me out to my car so she could actually feel what my husband & I were going through but that was a waste of my time!!!! She said she knew what our car & the other two looked liked after days of them sitting in their parking lot and NOT getting a phone call to report this to us. We had our cell-phones on vacation and if we would have gotten a phone call when this happened we could have contacted people to help us during the week and not on Super Bowl weekend when everyone was closed.

I had a full 24 hours before my flight left and didn't have a car to drive around, so this was my home for a day. I booked my room on Hotwire and I got a great deal. When I saw \"Crowne Plaza\" as the hotel after booking, I hesitated. My experience with this brand has been mixed, but mostly average. The second I walked in, I knew this place was different. The bellman, who was exceptionally well dressed, opened the door for me and welcomed me. He took my bags and walked me to the counter for check-in. The front desk staff are mature and competent. They wasted no time at all and were cheerful and friendly, despite the frigid weather than came through the night before. I checked in early, at 2 pm and was not given any hassle for the time being early, as happens in some hotels (I generally check in early and leave early, when possible). I was given a free drink coupon for the bar because I'm a Priority Club member. I went to my room. Along the walk and elevator ride, an overwhelming sense of \"quality\" was felt, like no other Holiday Inn product I'd ever experienced. Everything was so tasteful and well-appointed. There wasn't a piece of wallpaper peeled back, not a speck of paint out of place, nothing to complain about appearance. My room was modern and freshly renovated. Flat screen television was wonderful and worked flawlessly. The hotel bar and restaurant are decent, but a little on the pricey side. I ate breakfast in the restaurant, but ordered delivery for dinner from a local restaurant for a better value. Check out was convenient and quick. The shuttles run constantly during peak hours. This hotel is no longer facing the terminal since Indianapolis International Airport opened their new terminal building. Across the street is the old terminal, still sitting there, but no more activity. The shuttle takes about 10 minutes to get to the new terminal and was clean and well-appointed, just like the hotel. I read the reviews from people complaining about airplane noise. Well, let's be honest, this is a hotel that is literally at the airport. What would one expect? No noise? You've got to view this issue with a degree of reason. One of the runways has an approach literally over the hotel and it's not the most used runway here. It's used more during the day than night. I slept soundly all night. There is, as was pointed out, a major FedEx hub at this airport (second only to Memphis) and it operates after midnight. This is not your grandfather's 707. These planes are all very modern and not nearly as loud and planes of the past. I didn't really notice anything and I was on the top floor. No vibrations or anything like that. Just a highly muted \"whoosh\" here and there. The A/C in the room is louder. The building is well-insulated from the sound in my opinion. All in all, this hotel was a great value. It would be a great value at triple what I paid for the room through Hotwire. I got lucky, I guess. This hotel could just as well be a Marriott. The service is great, abundant, and the hotel just screams \"class.\" I think I'm enthusiastic about it because it really was such a pleasant surprise.

The other nice thing about the bath room was they must have a hot water recirculation system because there is no waiting at all for hot water. We did not try the restaurant or the pool but the pool looked very clean. The hotel is very large and has a beautiful lobby. It is in the flight path of the airport but the noise was hardly noticeable when the plains flew over. It is located just off of 465 so it is very easy to get to and from the hotel. The parking lot is well light and we felt very safe and comfortable through out the hotel property. If you stay at the Crown Plaza and are looking for a way downtown you can go straight north of the hotel on High School road and turn east on Washington. If you're looking for a great place to eat I suggest Cheeseburger in Paradise in the Southport area just off of 65 south of 465. Live music every night and the wait staff was great. I will be staying at the Crown Plaza again. Hopefully with a great deal like I got this time but I would not be angry if I would have paid $130 a night.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cOustanding Crowne Plaza Experience\u201d", "Author": "jimbol227", "ReviewID": "UR23592167", "Content": "Not only is this hotel aesthetically pleasing, but the staff is professional and detail oriented.

Great service, great amenities, great stay. Somebody is really paying attention to the details. It's architecture may be a little dated, but the recent renovations are well-done and it is beautifully decorated, which makes it feel more retro (?) than outdated I think. The pictures on their website do not do it justice--I hope they update them soon. The lobby is in a 5-story atrium. The hotel is obviously business-oriented with lots of informal gathering/sitting places in the lobby for all sizes of groups in addition to many conference and theater-type rooms. There were a few computers in the lobby and a business center as well. We were there Jan. 1 and 2 so there were no business people there, just a few families. We were able to get a great price via Priceline and I assume it was because it was a slow time for them. Our rooms were very nicely decorated, beds were great with lots of pillows and new, crisp white sheets and bedding. Everything was spotless. Nice, thick bath towels. Bathroom is a little small--hard to fit two adults in front of the mirror. We had to wait a long time for the hot water to kick in in our room, but in our sons' room it came on right away. Great shower head with an adjuster for spray and massage--good water pressure. Nice size flat screen t.v. and port for laptop in room at the desk. Lots of attention paid to details, for example, hair dryer was not the usual wall-mounted variety, but a full-size dryer (stored in a cloth bag), lighted make-up mirror, nicer toiletries with flip-tops, morning paper placed in cloth bag and hung over the door knob. Numerous nice little details--gave a very professional impression. I had read an earlier review that complained about some airport noise, so we requested a room where that would not be a factor when we checked in and we didn't hear a single plane. Our 2nd floor room had patio door access to a balcony walkway that overlooked the pool and atrium. Some of the kids were a little noisy, but it was completely quiet starting at 10 p.m. One of our sons took the airport shuttle at 4:30 a.m. The driver was there and waiting, very personable and friendly. Even the front desk staff came over and visited. All of the staff that we encountered were courteous and helpful. My husband and I had breakfast in the hotel dining room and it was very good--a little on the expensive side, but not beyond what you would expect to pay for a hotel restaurant. Near the entrance to the restaurant there was a take-out counter with a variety of foods to pick up on the go. I didn't really pay attention to all that they had, but did see cinnamon rolls, muffins and fresh fruit cups as we walked past. There was a small but very nice exercise room with treadmills, elipticals, bikes, weights, and a small refigerator with complimentary bottled water. Several t.v.s. It all seemed to be new or mostly new equipment and everything that we used was in good shape. Even though this hotel is business-oriented, I would recommend it for holidays/weekends for families or non-business groups as well--as long as they don't mind driving to restaurants, etc. The hotel is right at the airport and you do have to drive to get to anything, but it is very convenient to I-465.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbiana, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice newly renovated hotel\u201d", "Author": "bnich618", "ReviewID": "UR22709641", "Content": "Very nice hotel, the lobby is beautiful - apparantly they are just finishing up a total renovation.

There is a small older style elevator to take us upstairs - it fit the two of us and our 2 large suitcases and that was all! The other option was a steep staircase so very happy for the elevator. The room was small but had all the basics: good-sized bar fridge, comfortable bed, microwave, coffee-maker, iron and ironing board, large mirror. The room also has a ledge next to the window which was big enough to open up our suitcases on, which was good because there wasn't any room on the floor to do so. The free high-speed wireless was great. There were a large range of options for breakfast (included in the price): waffle iron, tea, cofee, orange juice, apple juice, 2 types of cereal, toast, fruit, mini muffins. The staff were friendly and held our bags after we'd checked out as we didn't have to leave the city until later in the day. The hotel is a $6 taxi cab ride from the train station (30th St Station) and we could walk to most of the places that we wanted to go from the hotel.

The front desk staff was nice and the room was clean. The only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the hotel, but there was a jackhammer going outside our window until 2AM. Then next day they started at 5AM, so we didn't get a solid night sleep during our entire stay. The front desk was immensely apologetic and we saw the front desk person pleading with the workers outside to stop at 1AM but they were having none of it. Either way, it won't be like that forever, but if you're staying in the coming days it could be a factor.

The other good news was that we got a great \"senior\" price, esp. for city center. Most of the front office staff was helpful, and our room was very large with two comfortable beds. Also, each room had a microwave and refrig, which we really appreciated. This is a very old building, with much need of upgrading. Although we were on the 6th floor, we could hear street noise as if it was right outside of our room. In my sister-in-laws room the towel rack came off the wall, and was never fixed. The elevator was small and very scary, with a very old system of door closing. On our first day, at one point we had to wait 1 1/2 hours in the lobby while they got someone to fix the elevator which wasn't running. The bathroom was small and basic. While we were there, they were in the middle of upgrading the locks, but before that happened we had to get our keys changed a few times as they didn't open the door.

(They insisted they finish sweeping before we walk from the elevator to our room.) About fifteen minutes later, the smoke alarm went off, and we evacuated. The staff was very sarcastic, and unhelpful. When I asked the woman if the construction would be going on all weekend, she got very short of with me. When I asked if I could switch rooms she let me know the hotel was booked. When I apologized for bothering her with what probably wasn't that big of a deal, she told me that she didn't care anyway, that people's problems \"amuse\" her.

The decor of my room was very dated, with fabrics and colors from the 80's. Not old enough to be retro yet, not new enough to seem clean and fresh. There was no view - just a painted over airshaft with a sad faux window treatment. The flat screen TV was great, but it was over a sad looking dresser which carried the scars of an older television installation. On the other side of the room was a newer desk and coffee making area. The bathroom was simple and clean. Their appeared to be some renovations in the works, so maybe I just got an older room. This vegetarian found the 'included' breakfast very sad as well.

The two man lift is just a death trap that kept stoping between floors, the doors had to be closed by hand. Not the old quaint relec type, but a modern lift that looked like it was made in Russia. We came to Philadelphia to see U2 at the Lincoln financial field on July 14th 2011. We paid $280 for two rooms for us and two friends to stay in after the concert and checked in at 4pm to find the rooms basic, no toilets or plumbing at all in the room, We had to go along the corridor to use a separate bathroom. As this was a big stadium and a sell out show, this hotel was full and most others in the area so we had no choice but to stay here, so we left in a hurry to get to the gig. On returning at about 11.30pm went to our rooms and did the usual bed check around the edge seam only to find hundreds of little bed bugs all around the edge of the mattress. To be fair, they were all dead so I am assuming the rooms have been fumigated in the past. However it is unacceptable to not have vacuumed the rooms and mattress to remove these. Just disgusting. We called reception to complain, but were told they were sold out so could not move us. We had no choice but to use towels to sleep on for the night. Our room and our friends rooms both had this problem. I removed about a dozen of the bugs with tweezers and put them in some tissue in the morning and took them down to reception and was asked to leave them for the manager to deal with. He would not be back until around noon so we were asked to come back. On our return the man who ownes the hotel was very hostile and asked why we had been poking around the mattress and had we brought these bugs to get the room cheaper. He was basically just a vile and nasty man and it was clear from his aggressive attitude he was used to telling his customers to get lost. The only positive on this miserable nights stay was the multi story car park was just across the road and was $10 per night. We parked on the top floor and could see the hotel up close from the outside and this confirmed the hotel was in serious disrepair. The roof was full of holes with pigeons living in the gaps where the wooden frontage has rotted away. They had left serious mess all down the front of the upper floors were we had been put.

After a quick debate, we decided this was fine and checked in. We then went to the lift - an experience in itself, not for the faint hearted, and checked out the room with separate bathrooms. The bathrooms were ok, but could have been cleaner, and our toilet had the wrong lid on it. This was nothing until we went out for the day, returned in the evening, and decided to inspect the bed. To our horror... BED BUGS.. We slept on towels on top of the bed, and on closer inspection, the room was totally shoddy. The curtains were held together with safety pins and they were filthy.

In the morning, I spoke to the receptionist, advising of my complaint, and that I didn't think I should pay. She advised me to Speak to the General Manager who would be in at 11am. I returned at 11am, and was met by the most arrogant, rude and dismissive indivudual I have had the misfortune to speak to. An English man with total attitude. He was not prepared to listen and I was told that he would not refund my money as I had used the services of the hotel - and the Bed Bugs. He then asked if I reported it to the night porter, I explained the situation, and he confirmed, that I should have asked for a refund at 1am and the night porter would help me find another hotel.

I was told it was new, but was uneven in a couple spots (I certainly hadn't noticed) and they called the contractor back in to do it all over. This is hardly the sign of management that doesn't care. The breakfast has a waffle station, cereal, yogurt and fruit and bagels and muffins. There was plenty there for us. 6. The room we had was quite large, nice high ceilings.

First, the a/c is different temperatures depending on what floor you're on. There are no temp controls in the room, you have to call the front desk, and when they say they'll adjust it for you, they DON'T. Secondly, this hotel advertises free wi-fi access, but don't expect to use it if you are staying on an upper floor. They only have one router - the one on the first floor. I was staying on the 6th floor, and had to go hang out in the 2nd floor breakfast area to use the internet. Third, the elevator almost never works during the day. It's like it can't handle the volume of calls to the different floors. It's terribly small, creaky, unreliable, and OLD. Nothing like paying over $100 for a room and then having to walk up 6 flights of stairs. The fourth issue is the outside noise that is all too prevalent. People screaming outside at 2am, the city jackhammering out the sidewalk at 7am... don't expect to get a good night's sleep here!! Fifth is breakfast. Your options are milk, juice, coffee, bagels, cereal, and donuts. Occasionally you are offered yogurt, but that wasn't consistent. Not the greatest breakfast, but my greatest complaint is that there is no cream cheese for the bagels. I mean, come on!! They offer butter and jelly, who puts that on bagels?! The last point of concern is the bathroom. It's almost impossible to get into the shower without getting water all over the floor, the towel rack is in the most inconvenient place possible, and you can't turn on the bathroom light without an incredibly loud fan running the entire time. While the negatives greatly outweigh the positives, I don't want to entirely discount this hotel. To its credit, it has a great central location, and it isn't dirty in the least.

He assured me that my needs would be met and they were. If you're a religious Jewish traveler like I am, this is the hotel for you. The hotel is clean and recently renovated, with more renovations in the plans. I arrived at 9am Friday morning, well before the 3pm check-in time. Sunil stored my suitcase and box of food and I sat in the quaint lobby working on my laptop. A short while later, Sunil offered to let me into an unoccupied room to be able to access the wireless network and a bathroom! That was really gracious, generous and beyond the call of duty. They have a breakfast lounge on the first floor where I could work comfortably as well. My room was ready well ahead of the 3pm check in and I was able to check in at 2pm when I returned from my lunch date with myself. The room was spacious, with 2 queen-size beds, a new TV, microwave and mini-fridge. There was a walk-in closet as well, and a writing desk, which unfortunately did not have an outlet next to it. Sunil assured me that they will be redoing the electrical plans in the near future to correct this. The wireless signal was too low to pick up in that room, but this is a temporary situation. Ask Sunil about it when you call to book. As I am Sabbath observant I requested and received a room on the first floor (I don't use the elevator on the Sabbath - stairs only). Also, as we do not operate any electric or electronic devices on the Sabbath I needed someone to open my room for me each time I entered on the Sabbath. Sunil and the staff were understanding and cooperative in this regard. They made our Sabbath observance possible, comfortable and care-free. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept in in recent memory. The room itself has a very homey feel - the furniture is not industrial or institutional, but looks like furniture you might have in your own home. On check-out day again I required my luggage and laptop stored, and the staff accommodated me on this. I would definitely return to this hotel should I need accommodations in Philadelphia. In short: comfortable, affordable, clean, excellent service, amenities and a helpful staff made my stay at this hotel one of the most pleasurable hotel stays I've ever had.

One room had a lock that would only lock if the door was yanked up. We did find lots of dust behind the beds when we pulled them out to plug something in. And they hardly had any plugs that looked safe to use. The head board fell off of the wall it was screwed onto one night. Another antiquated bed fell apart when we pulled it out to plug something in and they also had it up on a 2 X 4 on one side. They had mismatched railings on the narrow stairs that only 1 person could walk up at a time. Of all of the beds we saw, 2 were very saggy. Two beds appeared to be new pillow top mattresses and were good. We had to leave one room at 12:30 A.M. when we realized it would be too hot to sleep in there while the rest of the floor was cool. They control the air down at the desk and the first time we asked for it to be cooler they appeared to turn it up for a few minutes. So, we ended up switching rooms at about 1 A.M. because they would not turn it up enough to allow us to be cool.

[Fortunately, I paid by credit card; I am \"challenging\" the cost of the room with them.] The parent company--CHOICE hotels--was no more helpful. After I filed a complaint I was instructed to wait 7 to 10 days for someone to get back to me. Of course, that time came and went with no response. When I finally called CHOICE back, they insisted we should have packed up and moved -- at 3:30 am -- to a room that needed to be cleaned. (In fact, their handling of this matter will keep me from staying at any CHOICE-owned or operated hotel in the future.) This dump's location is all it has going for it. I urge you to pay a little more and stay somewhere else.

I could have done better blindfolded with duct tape and a glue gun. Room temperature would swing from the high 80's to the 50's. No thermostats in the room. Cleanliness was marginal. Found another hotel for another $30 per night that was 200% better. Overall I would say that only someone desperate for a room should consider this hotel.

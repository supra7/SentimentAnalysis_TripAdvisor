Not that the Super 8 Motel isn't any good but more that the review i am about to write is realistically constructive and not full of false promises. I would say this motel is a great spot for friends to use because it is cheaper than most and provides adequate service and convienient location relative to innercity areas such as gaslamp or shopping districts. Although the outside presentation of the motel is not that great( chipped stair well paint and lack of lighting at late night), it is great on the inside; in the place where you will actually be staying. Connecting rooms make it easier for friends to hangout and not be seperated from eachother simply for the sake of beds and it also keeps bigger families together so that more time can be spent with each other on vacation. By the way, don't forget to get juice(orange or passion fruit) from the lobby in the mornings; it was very good.

It is close to all the locations that I wanted to visit: Seaworld, Balboa Park, Seaport Village, and the USS Midway. It was reasonably price for a king size bed with a jacuzzi, wifi, HBO, continental breakfast, and I paid $86.40 for a night with AAA discount. That came out to be $95.47 with taxes. When I checked in on July 12, 2011, the front desk man said the Air Conditioning unit was not working. I thought the air was nice and cool outside when I checked in so it shouldn't be a problem. The man gave me room 111 which is adjacent to a busy street. FYI room 109, 110, and 111 are the ones that faces Rosecrans street. Once I was in, the room was extremely hot because the window as closed, and there was no space between the ceiling and the roof. The bed was a king size but very hard, uncomfortable and very little padding. The jacuzzi was reasonable but only only 5 of 6 nozzle was working. There was some black spot (mold) on the white caulking around the jacuzzi. The shower head was not flowing very strong like a hotel shower head should be. The cathode ray tube (CRT) television was pretty big, and free HBO was available. However, the picture quality was so static that It looks like analog antenna reception. There was free high speed internet that I was able to make a connection but only work part of the time. I spent more time trying to connect that actual using the internet. The room did not cool off until around 4 in the morning. With the window open, the noise was intolerable, and when it was closed, i could still hear car driving by. When I was checking out in the morning, I took a look at the free continental breakfast. I could see why it was free. There was about 3 mini muffins, a couple of other sweet bread, cornflake cereal and milk, and a small pot of coffee. I reminded the office lady that the AC was not working. She fired back \"the guy didn't tell you when you check in?\" I replied \"yes he did but I just want to remind you that it wasn't working.\" The she said \"you don't have to tell me how to run my job.\" That was the end of our conversation.

The first night, a drunken man started banging on our door at 3:30 AM and constantly knocked on our door and window for several minutes. We were two women alone in a hotel room in an unfamiliar city and didn't want to try to deal with it ourselves, so we called the front desk to have the manager chase him off. The desk worker on duty hung up on my roommate when she told him our problem. She immediately called back and asked if they could do something about it and was told, \"Just tell him to go away,\" before she was hung up on a second time. The knocking man wandered off on his own shortly afterwards, though we had been seriously considering calling the police since the management obviously didn't care about the safety of their guests. We thought this was incredibly unprofessional. The next day, our room was very cold and we couldn't get the heater in our room working. We called the front desk to ask about it and were told they couldn't do anything about it. They didn't even offer to move us to a different room, despite the fact there were several empty rooms we could have moved into. We asked for extra blankets and were told they didn't have any - again, there were several empty rooms. We spent 2 days freezing in our room before they were able to find a single spare blanket - not that helpful considering we had 2 beds - and it didn't look clean enough to use anyway. The next to last day of our trip, I wanted to call home and couldn't get the phone in our room to work. I called the front desk and was told that I had to pay a $20 phone deposit to have the phone line in our room turned on. I was making a single toll-free call with a calling card and thought this was a little ridiculous. Still, I went down to the office and payed the deposit and asked again about getting our heater fixed because our room was barely warmer than it was outside. This time, the desk worker told me that to get the heater working, we had to turn the temperature dial all the way to the cold side and then turn it on. Though completely counterintuitive, this worked when I tried it. We turned the heater off while we were out for conference activities that evening. When we turned it on after we returned, sparks started shooting out of the heater and the room was immediately filled with an acrid burning smell strong enough we had to open the door to air out the room, thus driving out what little heat we had managed to trap in the room. We spent our last night in a frigid room. This was probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, and I'm pretty cheap when it comes to these things. I've never been to a hotel that obviously cared so little about their guests. It would have expected this sort of service if the room was $40 a night in San Diego, but the hotel wasn't cheap. It was certainly not worth the money we paid. We also had other friends who stayed in the same hotel at the same time who had problems with their rooms too, so our room didn't see atypical for the hotel. I will certainly never stay in this hotel again, and I would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cBeyond a Nightmare\u201d", "Author": "dsellers", "ReviewID": "UR11231705", "Content": "My stay was beyond anything I have ever encountered!!! First of all when we checked in the guy at the desk was very rude. My husband and I had requested a room on the first floor the guy stated he had no rooms on the first floor. He was clearly lying, we noted empty rooms, on the first floor, even when we checked out the next morning. Then we went out to dinner and came back and got ready to go to bed. I was watching TV and out the corner of my eye I got movement, it was a COCK ROACH!!!!! Oh my god I almost had a heart atrtack. I stayed awake all night for fear I would fall asleep and roaches would be crawling all over me!! Matter of fact I watched throughout the night as the roaches came in and out of their hiding spaces, especially the refrigerator!! The next morning we told the same guy at the desk and he had the nerve to ask if we had food in the room!!! It was nasty and disgusting and I recommend NOBODY EVER SETS FOOT IN THAT PLACE!!!

When we first checked in the guy behind the desk refused to check us in because we didn't have the AAA card. It was with my girlfriends father who was at sea world. He raised his voice and started to scream and yell at me. I advised him that there is no need to raise his voice at me. He finally said ok, as long as you bring your AAA card before checkout, then I will give you the rate... As for the rooms, TERRIBLE.. extremely outdated, odor was horrible, had to buy a scented candle from the store to give somewhat of a fresh scent, but still the odor was overpowering. We stayed for two nights and after the first night, they did not take out any of the trash that was in the room.. The pool was extremely dirty with dirt piled in corners of the pool. I was not about to jump in there. No alarm clocks in the room, paint chipping off wall, spider webs hanging in corners of the room, bathroom door would not close, a/c barely worked.. If there were hotels available somewhere else I would have left that hotel in a heartbeat. Disgusting.. As for when I checked out, he charged me more than what he was supposed to and when I confronted him about it, he said tough luck, you should have shown me the AAA card at the time of check in. I told him that he told me as long as I showed it by check out then we would be fine, He said he never told me that.. I never signed the receipt and asked for a manager, he said there wasn't one cuz it was sunday and that if I had a problem then to call back during the week.. I asked for a phone # to the manager and all he gave me was a card and it wasn't even for a manager.. This guy was the rudest person I ever met in my life and it takes a lot to make me mad, and i was furious...

Unfortunately the manager doesn't know mch about treating customers as I heard him yelling across the parking lot at some guests telling them to walk their lazy selves to the lobby if they wanted him to do anything for them. Then he came back in the lobby and I heard him basically say 'tough luck' to a family whose TV wasn't working. After he left I had to listen to the clerk complain about the rude manager and how all the employees want to quit. My main issue though was we arranged for a wake-up call at 4:30 am for a 6:15 flight and it never came! There are no clocks in the room. Luckily my husband set his watch alarm so we didn't miss the plane.

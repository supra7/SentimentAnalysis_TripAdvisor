The staff was attentive and pleasant. The room was very clean and it was nice to have a fridge and microwave. Beds were very good and it was nice and quiet. They have a breakfast that was good. Pretty typical fare but they did have some protein options of boiled eggs so that helped. At first I thought this might be a bit too far south, but we had no problem accessing everything we wanted to do in San Diego. In fact, I think it helped being south of town a bit.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara", "Title": "\u201cNice Motel and very nice people\u201d", "Author": "GracieLee'smom", "ReviewID": "UR121645304", "Content": "I thought this hotel was great.

Price pretty good @ $76. Bed comfortable. Loved having a microwave and mini fridge in the room. Free cable and wi-fi. What I had problems with was the continental breakfast -- the apples had been refrigerated and the boiled eggs as well. Who knows how old the eggs were, as the yolks definitely did not appear to be fresh. The waffles however were ok, freshly made. Also, the room was quite noisy with a worker power washing the building in the morning, however that's just when we were there so it shouldn't be a problem for most travelers. The air conditioner was loud too. I think I would stay again, but just skip the breakfast :)", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec", "Title": "\u201cDecent, met my expectations\u201d", "Author": "djsunshine99", "ReviewID": "UR116628581", "Content": "Location is convenient, next to Highway 5. You reach the San Diego zoo in 20 minutes. Southern beaches are easily reachable within a 10 minute drive. A few fast food restaurants along the H-5 service road. Rooms are of a good size. The hotel is well maintained. Decent breakfast. Staff was nice or politely ignored me. But never rude. Less than basic personal care products. I guess you have to ask for it, which I do not consider normal. This BW met my expectations without exceeding them in any ways. It was my first time in San Diego. For my next visit, I will look for an hotel in the area called 'Hotel circle' (north-western corner of H5 and H8) I think it would be the best location.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Soldonta, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ReluctantTraveler00", "ReviewID": "UR95126072", "Content": "Clean, comfortable, basic rooms.

They not only have a trash can in the rooms but a RECYCLE bin as well in the ROOM.

Here's a breakdown of this hotel: Positives: -The prices were very affordable (~ $89/night). -The housekeeping service was prompt and very thorough. -They had a pool, but we never used it. -There was plenty of parking. -The air conditioning was FREEZING cold (thank goodness!) -Our room also had a microwave, a mini-fridge, a blow dryer, and a coffee maker. -Free cable TV! Negatives: -Although we arrived at around 12:30 and the room was already made up, the front desk told us it would be \"about an hour\" until we could move in. (We moved in anyways.) -There was a perpetual smell of raw sewage in the room; especially in the bathroom. Nothing was leaking and we couldn't track it down to a source, but the smell never went away. -The two beds weren't firm enough, and the pillows were too thick. -There was no free shampoo or conditioner; they want you to use a single, unlabeled, wall-mounted soap pump in the shower (like at an auto body shop!) -The cereal dispenser constantly jammed at the continental breakfast.

My room was CLEAN and the bed was very comfortable (they just got new pillow top mattresses). The maid service was EXCELLENT!!! The ladies at the front desk were very rude and ignorant - although when making my reservations they were very nice on the phone. Just very aloof in person. It could be the culture (everyone that works there is Mexican). I only had a problem once when I asked them to call me a cab for an appointment I had and after waiting around for 30 minutes they remembered they \"forgot\" to call. They could have cared less about me getting to any appointment on time and laughed at the fact they forgot to call my cab - they were amused. The shuttle service to/from clinics were nice to have although they have \"limited\" shuttle service. Once again - the bathrooms were clean - the rooms were clean - exactly what you would expect from a Best Western property. Basic. If you are having minor surgery and would like to stay in the US - its a good place to recover. The neighborhood is not \"bad\" as some people stated - I stayed there alone and never once felt uneasy. I would only recommend this hotel if you are having medical procedures in TJ - due to the shuttle service.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Americana Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d81797-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Americana_Inn-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$65 - $112*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">815 West San Ysidro Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92173-1827</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "81797", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2f/01/2f017a8b475cabb0634092126ad1eb0912large.jpg"}}

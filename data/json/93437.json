Always wanted to visit this city, but the high prices (compared to holidays in Florida) and scary stories about bedbugs kept me from visiting NYC. After I found cheap flighttickets, it was time to find a nice hotel. On Expedia I found The Edison Hotel for about 105 euro's (136-140 dollars) a night. Good enough for me. I read about it on TripAdvisor first, and I expected an old hotelroom, but I probably got a renovated room on the 11th floor at the end of the hallway with a window also on the side of the building, facing the Hudson river. I wrote down some stuff on my iPod Touch, so I wouldn't forget about it after the trip. Here's what I wrote down; - Clean room, not too big, not too small either. Two nice queensized beds, pillows are a bit too high if you sleep on your stomach. I decided to sleep without a pillow. There is some noise from outside (hey, it's NYC!) so if you are a light sleeper, take some earplugs with you and you will sleep like a baby. Outdated rooms? Not this one. Even the beds looked new. - No bedbugs! I was really scared of this and I check each hotelbed I sleep in, thoroughly, to make sure it's really free from these bugs. I'm not afraid to get bitten, I'm afraid to take them home with me. New York City seems infested with these creatures if you search for it online. I think each hotel might have them, travelers take them with them etc. but if only 1% of the rooms might have them in The Edison, that's only 9 rooms. Sounds much as a number, not as a percentage. Anyway, I didn't find them on my search. - Small bathroom, new sink, bathtub and probably toilet. Because of bad ventilation, there are some moldspots on the ceiling, also between the tiles on some places. Showercurtain is mold-free. It's hard to keep the mold away without proper ventilation, and not that strange for an older building. Yet it's healthier to fix this, but it's a big job. No mold in the room itself, just the bathroom. The showerhead wasn't that nice to me. It had like fast strong short bursts of water, I'd like to see that changed for a more pleasant experience in the shower. - Nice 32 inch flatscreen in the room with adjustable swingarm. Didn't watch much TV, but I always like to watch the local news to know what's going on in the place where I'm staying. - Next to the smoke detector there's also a carbonmonoxide detector in the room. I like that! - Six fast elevators (at least, compared to the ones I'm used to in Holland), security in the lobby which doesn't let you through if you don't show your roomkey(card). Also camera's in the elevators and on all floors. No need to wait long for an elevator is on your floor. - Staff is friendly and always willing to help you. Needed to find a restaurant, but didn't remember the address, no problem in looking that up for me on the net. They even didn't know at that point that I was a guest or not. Got a late checkout free of charge. - ATM in the hotel, but it didn't work with my debit and creditcard for some reason. The ATM in Duane Reade's did (it's almost right outside the hotel on 47th street and 8th ave). This one is even cheaper (additional costs of $ 1,99 instead of $ 3,25 in the hotel). - The hotel is close to a lot of things, probably 50 meters away from Times Square, and on walking distances of a lot of things; Central Park, 5th ave, St. Patricks cathedral, Rockefeller Plaza, USS Intrepid and if you like walking, also the Empire State Building. If you don't like walking, there are some subwaylines near the hotel to take you anywhere you like in the Big Apple. - The Edison Cafe has a lot to offer for breakfast and lunch. Good food and not expensive. Will I be back? Sure, if the price is right. The prices change each month at most hotels I guess, right now it had a perfect price for a perfect location. I had a great time in NYC!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "chris c", "ReviewID": "UR126673401", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights over Spring Break.

The check in/check out time took a cumulative 5 minutes. The kept our luggage several hours on the last day while we squeezed in a few more hours of fun. The concierge knew just about everything, and the few things he didn't, he researched and found out quickly. And everybody was genuinely friendly. The hotel was well located, both to the Theater District, as well as to a large subway station a few short blocks away, literally a three-four minute walk. If you're into the whole Times Square thing it's right there. Well, not right there, you really can't see it from your room, but it's about 200 feet to the right as you exit the front door. I was a little worried about it being obnoxious and noisy. It really wasn't. I'm kind of a light sleeper and the noise from the eighth floor never kept me awake. There's a great bagel place on the way to the subway named Time Square Bagels. Any line in the morning move quickly, but know what you want or you'll get treated like an idiot. Let's be honest though, if you're standing in line with a giant sign/menu in front of you for five minutes, and you don't know what you want, well, you kinda deserve it.

I received an email confirming these exact details the same day which all looked promising, how wrong I was! On arriving at the hotel, I was a little disappointed at how different, or should I say run down, the exterior of the hotel was compared to the pictures on the web and within brochures. Once inside, however, the lobby/reception area was a little better. This feeling soon faded when we began the check in process. We were booked in by the 'assistant manager' who booked us into a double room with a pull out sofabed (I was travelling with my sister and my father) on explaining that this room was unsuitable and on producing the email confirming the booking I had made for a specfic type of room, the assistant manager told me over and over again that the hotel did not operate a policy where the would guarantee a specific room and the member of staff who sent me the email was wrong to do so. On attempting to discuss the situation with the assistant manager, she constantly spoke over me telling me she was trying to explain what the hotel policy was. Not very professional or polite, I thought! The assistant manager then told me that she could give us another room that one of us could stay in - a bit of a compromise we were prepared to make until she said it was going to to cost us $229.00 per night!! Clearly that wasn't happening. On asking, again, to see 'the' manager, the assistant manager went into a back office and reappered five or so mins later when she, in a very unfriendly manner, told me she had a suite with three beds she would move us to, excellent, I thought. Where to start with the 'suite'. The bathroom was awful. The grout between the tiles was black and mouldy, the toilet bowl was situated in such a stupid postion that you had to step over it to get into the bathroom itself. The shower was little more than a warm drip. Not great. The beds were comfortable but the room badly needs redecorated. The carpets were threadbare and the walls were filthy, there was even a bootprint halfway up our wall!! In saying all this however, I must say, we did sleep very well as it was very quite (21st floor) and the bed linen was clean. And now to Cafe Edison. This 'restaurant' is attached to the hotel, I believe it is rented independently but to the average guest, one would presume that it was part of the hotel. We were fortunate enough to only enter this place once. We went for breakfast on Tuesday morning. The first word that springs to mind regarding this place is 'dire'. Service was quick, thankfully, so quick, infact, that my sister's tea cup had not even been cleaned on the outside after another unfortunate patron has drank from it!! After just one bite of my toast, my eyes suddenly locked onto the mouse that ran across the dining room!! We, quite clearly left, immediately, despite the waiter shouting that we had not paid the bill. We never did pay the bill! On complaining to the manager, I have to admit that he dealt with the complaint promptly and he himself was horrified and embarrassed by the mouse situation.

Hopefully you are not planning to go to New York and stay in your room! Cafe Edison is great for breakfast. Dont bother to shop around, its good value and great food and service. The gift shop and bar are good too, and both worth a visit. We got welcomed with free wine on Friday afternoon and greeted by customer relations staff, who were very helpful. I found reception staff to be a little less welcoming, and not over friendly or helpful. But dont let that deter you, as you have a concierge, security and others who are all helpful and accommodating. Rooms were cleaned well, daily, with fresh towels and linen and toiletries. Will definately stay here again, and am happy to reccommend it!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStandard hotel with the BEST location!\u201d", "Author": "Selby05", "ReviewID": "UR126058967", "Content": "I stayed here a week ago whilst on a college trip!

We booked a Queen room through Expedia (best rate we found) and requested a renovated room via the hotel. On arrival, check in was quick and friendly and we were allocated a room on the 17th floor. Our overall first impression was indecisive as to whether we had been given a renovated room or not, as parts of the room were a little on the shabby side. However, the room was clean, relatively spacious with a huge, very comfortable bed, nice bed linen, and a large television. The bathroom was on the small side and the bath itself was very small, however the shower over was nice and powerful which was great. Even though we were on the 17th floor, traffic noise could still be heard 24/7, but this is New York and only to be expected (we took ear plugs with us which cut out the noise so we slept well). We had breakfast at the Edison cafe once, and found it to be quite good in terms of food choice and cost. Service was very efficient and we weren't kept waiting, even though it was quite busy. There are computers for guests to use on the ground floor for a charge, however both checking-in online and printing your boarding pass is complimentary, which is extremely useful. There is also a travel desk and a computer terminal near reception so you can book a car/shuttle etc back to the airport (we found it was a little more expensive than booking direct with the shuttle bus company at around $27 pp to JFK, but this was inclusive of tax and gratuities). There is a comfortable seating area by reception, and someone will call you when your transport arrives. You can also leave your luggage at the hotel after checking out at a very reasonable 50 cents per bag.There is a little shop in the hotel where you can buy snacks, papers and gifts, which we found to be cheaper than the other touristy shops in the area. On the whole, we would recommend this hotel if travelling on a budget. The location is fantastic, being just steps away from Times Square and the TKTS booth.

It's the third time we stayed at the Edison Hotel. We pre-booked the room long ahead through our travel agent and we got a really good price. The staff was very helpful when we arrived with our car (and loads of luggage). But then the Check-In: We did book a room for two with a queen bed. The quite unfriendly desk staff told us there's only a double-bed left (smaller than a queen). We argued a while but then decided to take it anyway. But then we went to our room....what a shock! It was so small, the bed did barely fit in there and was tiny. The furniture and bed looked so old and tired. And we almost couldn't fit our luggage in the room. We couldn't accept that. The other two times we were here we got much bigger rooms with a much newer interiour. So my wife went back down to the front desk and told the we will not accept this. We booked long ahead, we stayed here before, we will stay for 7 nights and will not accept this room. If not, we want our money back and stay somewhere else. After a few minutes the manager stepped in and....surprisingly there WAS another room available. A lot bigger room with a King-Bed ... the room was more than twice the size of the other one. After that our day was saved and we could enjoy our 7 nights in NYC. The Hotel itself is dated, but the location is, for this price, unbeatable! The room was clean and actually really big (by NYC standard). The bathroom was also a quite dated, but clean enough. And even though the Hotel is so close to Times Square, we had quiet nights here and a really good sleep. We had a good week, after a pretty bad start. It's comfy, it's safe and you just really get great value here. Staff is helpful and nice (not counting the Check-In). We sure would stay again.

Nothing has really happened here since my very first stay way back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apart from escalating prices! On the positive side you find no better location. The Edison is a few yards from the hustle and bustle of the ever alive Times Square and hence the perfect place to stay if you are in town for sightseeing and theatre. All major theatres are minutes of leisurely strolls away only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and last minute tickets can be purchased at the booth right on the square at affordable rates.

But \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is really nothing nice otherwise to be said about the hotel as such. In spite of several refurbishing rounds, it looks still very old and shabby. The regular rooms are tiny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even compared to European standard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which says a lot. You can hardly squeeze a double bed with a single side table into the rooms, that seem dark and uninviting. The bathrooms are likewise tiny and look like they have been painted over and over without anyone having removed the old peeled paint prior to. I can really say nothing nice about these rooms apart from it being a place to put your suitcase and drop your head for a bit of sleep. Being in a typical old New York building your view is likewise most likely to be the room across from you and with really nothing to look at and keeping light out. The rooms have no facilities to mention and are lacking security boxes. You need still to go down to the reception and ask for them to store your valuables in a vault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning having to queue additionally up whenever you need any of your stuff or need to open/close your box.

The location of the hotel is great as its in walking distance to most things to see. After a delayed flight we arrived later than planned to new york and decided that we would get some sleep before exploring the city. On first appearances the room looked ok, maybe a little dated, not the queen bed or refurbished room we had requested but the view made up for this a little. Someone had left the bathroom window open which was making the room quite cold as it was late, when my hsuband tried to close it the window fell out on him in the bathroom - quite a death trap to be honest with potential to seriously hurt yourself or someone passing by on the street below if it fell the opposite way. We were prepared that being so close to times square that there maybe be some noise in the room however we weren't prepared on the noises from the hotel itself - after falling asleep I was woken in fear, in my sleepy daze I thought someone had managed to get into the room while we were alseep and was now crashing around in our bathroom, as my husband went to investigate it turned out to be the heating pipe in the bathroom that ran between floors (I would explain this to sound like someone hitting a scafolding pole repeatedly with a heavy duty spanner), this started off our first sleepless night as it would eventually stop banging after 10 - 15mins and then start again about 20 min's later. We got what sleep we could and in the morning complained and asked for someone to have a look at our room. After explaining the situation to reception the reluctantly sent someone up to have a look, he arrived promptly, looked at it and immediately proceeded to explain that there was nothing he could do as it was the heating pipe for the hotel and it would proceed to make the noise every 30mins as thats what the heating timer was set to and it may make these noises more frequently if it is could outside as it is set to maintain a certain temperature. After complaining further the reception reluctantly changed our room but couldn't understand what all the fuss was about as apparently this is the norm for new york hotels! Room 2 - seemed to be closer to times square as your could hear the police cars clearer starting and stopping their sirens trying to get through the traffic. However we were now woken up our neighbours each time they would run any water (sink, shower or toilet) which would sound like they were in the room with us. Certainly in our own room you wouldn't want to have a wash in the sink or take a shower if your partner was still asleep and wouldn't dare flush the toilet as this would end is an extremely loud vibration and bang after the bowl emptied. In the end we gave up and decided not to continue complaining as the chances of finding a room of good standards in this hotel seem to be slim and although our second room had its problems it was the lesser of two evils. The room keepers are dreadful, the do not understand what the do not disturb signs mean as they would continue to enter the room, on 3 nights they knocked on our door in the early hours of the morning (with the sign on the door) attempting to give us bedding that we hadn't requested and would not appologise when they were told they had the wrong room, one on occasion not even the floor number was correct let alone the room number. Generally the staff are unhelpful, especially the door man how would scowl at you and even go to the extent of walking away from the door without opening it for you when your hands were full with bags etc. The bar was in our opinion exspensive. We tried once to enter the small shop that was reported to have essentials but it was closed. The reception was more often than not unhelpful. Conceirge were helpful enough however I would not suggest getting theatre tickets from them as they are expensive and can be brought cheaper elsewhere. After all the other problems with the hotel I wasn't happy about trying the hotel restaurants and preffered to eat elsewhere. The hotel does offer luggage storage after you check out at a rate of 50c per bag per day however one or two of the bell men will expect a high tip as I was listening to one requesting tips from others storing their luggage.

It's a classic theatre district hotel. When you choose the Edison, it is not going to be the Ritz Carlton as far as furnishings, but the price is not going to be the Ritz Carlton either!!! The Cafe Edison is my favorite New York breakfast spot - the waitstaff are friendly, fast-paced and pure New York. Sofia's, a restaurant and bar in the hotel, offers great cocktails and conversation.

We couldn't find the commands for the system so we went to the front desk to ask for a solution. They said they will send someone... One hour later we asked again, then nothing again. In the end we asked for extra blankets (there was none in the room) and when the maid knocked at our door we got... extra pillows ! Tired after a very long day/trip and desesperate we finally fell asleep to wake up at 5 am, frozen to the bones. Hence after breakfeast I asked to change room, The new one was much warmer. The heating system was not blowing cold air, which was a big plus, but it was not heating either. We gave up and decided to go enjoy the city. In the evening the room was no much warmer, so I went down to the front desk again and a miracle happened : one of the clerk actually knew something about the heating system. You had to open a grid in the bottom to access the controls. Hallelujah.

My 26yr old son wanted to know if this was an upgrade, what was the size of the room we would have got before. I explained that this is NYC and unless you pay lots and go for something a lot newer, this is what you get. I didn't mind the size of the two rooms. With three of us the fold-out bed was used and we had to ask for more blankets in order to make this a little more comfortable. The hotel was great and gave us a fridge and we bought a kettle so we were able to have tea/coffee/breakfast in our room. What was a shock was the size of the bathroom. It was possible to sit on the toilet and have a wash in the basin at the same time. To climb into the bathtub needed clever manipulation. I can't say for sure but I think the floor probably wasn't vacuumed in all the time we were there. I was there a number of times when the room was serviced and it seemed a very rough and ready clean.

You're greeted by a classy-looking lobby when you enter the hotel, and I found all the staff there to be friendly and helpful. My only warning would be in terms of the beds, which can range from very comfortable to very hard depending which room you get. Our first night proved to be less-than-comfortable as we got a hard-bed room, and had difficulty figuring out how to cool off the room. We reported our concerns to the front desk staff and they were very helpful and apologetic, offering to show me several rooms they had available to see if there might be a room with softer beds. We found one that fit the bill, and spent the final two nights there sleeping comfortably. They also gave us the first night free due to our concerns with the room discomfort, which was nice. My advice is to sit or lay down on the bed when you check into the room before unpacking, to make sure you have a room with a comfortable bed. Some of the rooms have been recently renovated, but some of them have hard beds too. We also requested a room facing away from the street on a higher floor, and weren't bothered by any street noise. There's also plenty of elevators, so we never had to wait long for one. There are computers available for guests to use for a charge, but not as expensive as some other hotels I've stayed at.

I suggest requesting a renovated room upon check in and then don't return until you're ready to call it a night...soak up the city!", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "peterj911", "ReviewID": "UR122524983", "Content": "They say that location is everything, and that's definitely the case with the Edison Hotel just off Times Square in New York City. Literally steps away from the Red Steps and the Broadway TKTS booth, the hotel's site on West 47th Street is about as convenient as you can get to the center of the Times Square action. So it was a pleasant surprise to find that a moderately-priced (for NYC) property could also be such a pleasant place to stay. We were refered to the Edison by family who had stayed there previously (and who we were meeting in NYC at the hotel for a family celebration). They called it \"adequate.\" But the lobby was lovely with its Art Deco theme, and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby was bustling when we checked in, but the wait was not long and our room was ready even though we checked in prior to 3PM. Yes, the Edison is an older hotel, and some of the rooms (including ours on the 16th floor) are very small and somewhat tired. However, we're aware that the hotel is in the midst of room renovations, and that they simply had not reached our floor yet. Regardless, the room was more than adequate for our needs. One very positive aspect of this room (the first of two we stayed in during this visit) was the shower in the bathroom. Our experience with hotel showers is generally not good, and we didn't expect much this time, but were very pleasantly surprised with the excellent water pressure, as well as the height of the shower on the tub wall. My wife and I are both tall, and the shower was a wonderful treat after a day of walking the streets of New York. We had our 16th floor room for one night, and then checked out so that we could re-check in under a different reservation when the rest of our family joined us. Our second room was on the 5th floor and was much larger, and had obviously been renovated. Shower was just as good there, too, though! Another observation about the Edison is that the elevators were speedy--there are plenty of them, and we rarely had to wait more than a few seconds for one of them to arrive. We'll definitely consider the Edison again when visiting New York.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Service & Staff\u201d", "Author": "Vera S", "ReviewID": "UR122518826", "Content": "Though I have not had the pleasure of staying with the Edison, I hope to share in the experience some day.

Stayed there four days between Christmas and New Years. I had stayed two nights at another hotel in NYC (Park 79 at Central Park) and moved out because it was a horrid experience. I felt lucky to book this hotel online at short notice, and honestly did not have high expectations. The price was lower than some of the hotels in the area, so I truly went with low expectations. I am traveling with my college-age son. When we walked in, we thought they might have messed up our reservation because the room was huge (compared with the one we had just checked out of--- for the same price). It was set up as a suite with a pull out sofa/sitting area, which was perfect for a parent and teenager. The location was great, the concierge was great, and it was a nice experience. Okay--- let's shoot straight here. If I was traveling for romance or for business and money was not an object, this might not have been my choice because it is an older property. But for families or those on a budget (I use the term loosely because the hotel was still a couple hundred a night-- but budget compared to those around it), you really can't go wrong. I do not know if all rooms are arranged as suites, or if you have to reserve it. I did have the option of a 'regular room' or 'delux'. I chose delux because it was just an extra $10 per night. I checked their web site and see that if you aren't trying to stay there during Christmas week, the rooms are actually very reasonable during normal times of the year. Great value.

We traveled down with a bus tour run by McCoy Bus Lines from Kingston, Ontario for the first and last time. Be prepared to trip, bodycheck or just shank your fellow passengers if you want a good seat because according to our guide the Bus line doesn't care and you are on your own. For the price I knew I wasn't staying at The Plaza and I didn't. I assume when the tour company squeezes them for prices they give the old unrenovated rooms to those customers. I would look forward to visiting on my own as I think the service can be very impressive under the right conditions. 1) The Room: 919 - Old unrenovated. New windows. Plumbing and furnishings that were new when Hoover was in office. Sheets were clean and no signs of tiny livestock (on us or linens) older oversized closet (walk-in is a stretch) nice size however the anti-theft hanger system is a pain if you travel with your own hangers. Bathroom was the same vintage as the beautiful lobby although not as well maintained. No Bar Fridge (although, their web site says I will have to leave a credit card to use the fridge or the phone) and no WI-FI without the $9.95 per day charge. Disappointed that I couldn't check with home in Canada without extra charges in roaming fees, rooms phone charges or Internet access. Our view was awful however, I have no doubt there are worse views and you are staying in Manhatten so just what view do you expect for what you are paying? 2) The Hotel: It's New Years Eve in NYC, they have one ice machine in the entire hotel (really!?) and it's broken. So not impressed. The lobby? it is a work of art and I so wished the rest of the hotel lived up to its promise. I know they are trying to keep up the renovation work and I know it is not easy to get everything done as quickly as people want, they could be a little more honest with their web site and show what they offer today. Not what they will offer in the future (renovated rooms) or what they offered many years ago (the views from their rooftop of Times Square which have been blocked for years). 3) The Location: A 5 minute walk from times Square when we were there for New Years Eve was a huge bonus. Theatres all around, and most a very short walk, first rate for that advantage. 5 - 10 minutes down 46th takes you into Restaurant Row, choose your cuisine and price range and you will find it, many Zagat rated. 4) The attached Coffee/Breakfast shop. Is a downtown city, breakfast eatery. It's fast, cheap and average. If you want the Waldorf go there and pay $25 for Eggs Benedict not $9.95. One warning, like much of NYC the gratuity is included so watch your tipping. 5) The concierge staff: A complete waste of time, tried to recommend Midtown Cigars when I was looking for Nat Sherman, not in the same league. Couldn't do anything for theatre tickets other than rack prices or tell me to stand in line. Like most mid-line hotels with Concierge they are nothing but glorified information desks.

Does New York City not have public health inspectors?\u201d", "Author": "VBSLondon", "ReviewID": "UR121728252", "Content": "Without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, outside of India. This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by \"new reviewers\", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed \"damage limitation department\". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully \"third time lucky\", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of \"ventilation hole\" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at \"Delta\", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the \"1 review\" brigade that posts rave reviews.

The public areas are spotless as well. Our room was in need of some renovation. The mattresses could stand to be replaced and our table was rickety, but again, the room was CLEAN. And frankly, for the amount of time we spent in the room, it was just fine. The staff was very professional and courteous. I really feel we hit on a good place to stay while visiting NYC. There is a restaurant on site, Cafe Edison, which we did not visit due to time constraints. Family members who live in NY have been there several times before and after shows and swear by the food and prices. We did look at the menu and found the prices to be very reasonable. We heard nothing but good things about the Cafe from anyone we asked. All in all, a great weekend trip for us at a good hotel, centrally located to many things. I would recommend the Edison to friends and others. And to put everyone's minds at ease, we did not experience any issues with bed bugs.

Of course not - silly .... closer inspection showed that the curtains were not actually on a rail but had been screwed directly through the fabric into the wall. Someone had obviously tried to close them (as one would) and ripped them away from their fix. Dirty nets, dead bugs and a mouldy bathroom added to the 'interest' of this room.

Lots of great restaurants, delis and shops in the area. The Rockefeller centre is a few minutes walk from the hotel, lots of things to see in the area. At night there are police officers everywhere, we felt very safe walking around at all times. The hotel itself is an older place and the rooms are dated. It was clean and the cleaning staff were very good and efficient. I know some people would not like the place because it does look old, but for the price it is what you expect. There are newer fancier hotels in the area but you would be paying more than twice what you pay at the Edison. We weren't in the room that much so it was fine for us. We ate one breakfast at the cafe in the hotel, it was OK but there are so many places nearby I would suggest you go out most days and look around, there is lots to choose from. Restaurant Row is just two blocks from the Edison. If you like fresh croissants for breakfast, I would suggest trying Amy's Bakery on 9th Street just north of 46th Street. They are great. The check in at the hotel went smoothly and was very good. The staff were friendly and efficient and we had no concerns with anything during our stay. There were lots of people using the hotel and I would say that for the price charged, it is a good deal.

If you are looking for the greatest hotel in the history of hotels, don't book here.

It is a minutes walk from four Subway staions which will take you everywhere. You are 15 seconds from times square. about ten minutes slow walk from central park, a 5 minute subway ride from theempire state, what more could you possibly want?? Please bear in mind it is not the Hilton where you would pay for one night what you would get a week in here. I booked this through a package deal and got it very cheap. The second i arrived at the airport, 23rd September i think, there was a 5.9 earthquake in virginia, yet despite the fact that the hotel staff probably had to do safety checks of things like the boiler systems and gas tanks and whatnot, we got checked in straight away into to our decent sized airconditioned room with a TV, Bath/Shower and everything else we needed. The only thing it didn't have that could have been useful was a fridge. however we just used the air-con for that. our stay in the hotel was delightful, with no problems. then, the day before we were set to go home, a HURRICANE roaring up the east coast caused all of the flights to be cancelled. So after a ridiculous amount of time trying to get through the travel agants, insurance people and booking agents, they sent an email to the hotel extending our stay, (as we had to remain in NYC for another 6 days!!!! (which isnt really a bad thing :) )) when we went down to the desk the manager came to see us personally and extended our stay at no extra charge to us. We were even offered a bigger room which we declined as all of our stuff was already unpacked in our room. Despite the several setbacks to the trip, the hotel made it as comfortable as possible, and gave us advice on what to do should it be bad (which forunatley for Manhattan, it wasn't.) which was nice as we had no idea what we should do in a hurricane or earthquake. The restaurant and the deli on either side of the hotel served low priced very nice food and drinks, ( a beer costing 3 -4 dollars as opposed to the 8-15 in bars and other restaurants.) And, they stayed ipen during the Hurricane for patrons of the hotel. The location, the room and the staff made our stay excellent, and helped turn a really quite scary experience (as although the hurricane turned out to not affect Manhattan, no body really knew what was going to happen, ourselves especially) into a really memorable trip, and our room on the 12th floor of the Edison hotel is a major part of that. I know this review isnt really relevant to people who are looking to book a trip, i am simply saying that the hotel helped to make our extended holiday really really great.

We got to our room and it was dull and dreary and looked like it could do with decorating. Like a previous comment on here has said, the sockets were not very safe.

We haven't got them. They can be a bit daunting. BIG THANK YOU TO THAT REVIEWER. We were in New York for four nights from July 10 and the location of the Edison is hard to beat. However our room left a lot to be desired. We were on the 6th or 7th floor and I can only conclude from the many reviews that things are better on the higher floors. Our room was shabby-depressing. There was a heat wave on in New York and the old air conditioner wasn't up to the job. There was a constant whiff of toilet and no matter how diligently the maid cleaned the bathroom there was just not adequate ventilation . . . the bathroom was very old and decrepit . . . poorly ventilated. Our first contact with front desk was not good. We had a young woman who seemed to be world-weary . . . defeated by life. She just did not want to be bothered with us. However there was a great concierge who put us onto a corner cafe/ breakfast place -- out the back door and turn right a couple of blocks --Galaxy Diner. Ignore the hostess at the Galaxy -- another sourpuss -- embittered by life. . . . What is it with these young, beautiful New York women? Would it hurt them so much to smile occasionally?

The bed was extremely hard and one of the pillows felt like it was full of rocks. We literally could not walk on one side of the bed unless we walked sideways and two people couldn't pass at the foot of the bed...one had to sit on the bed to allow the other to pass. However, the room with two-beds was very spacious and the bathroom just a tad bit larger; so our second night at the Edison was much more comfortable than night one. If we ever stay at the Edison again, I would definitely request a two-bed room.

I have been to New York a few times and brought 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newbies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the city! Our first worry was bedbugs as we are aware they are a problem in the city, we went through the room with a fine tooth comb and all was clean. Mattress had a plastic cover which I am guessing was protection against these pesky creatures. Although the room, especially the bathroom could of benefited from some renovations (shower walls a little damaged, some cracks and nicks, nothing major) it was clean and great for the price. The room was not huge but, we were fine even with 4 girls in one room. There was one closet, a TV bureau and a table & chair, the basis. If you are looking for storage for your clothes, this might be minimal though. The wi-fi connection comes at a high fee, but if you walk 20 seconds outside Times Square offers free wi-fi (which we sometimes caught from inside the room) As many said, the location cannot be beat! In the heart of Times Square close to everything! Although, if your looking for a quiet neighborhood, this might not be it. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anything any noise from inside the room, but we went to bed for 4 am. Everything was functional, AC, lights, water. The shower also, but the shower head didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer much of a stream (or am I too used to my giant shower head at home?) We did not have much contact with the hotel staff, but they were courteous every time. We ordered extra pillows and blankets and got them right away, got access to the lobby phone pretty easy and got all the information we asked. Security at all times on the elevators, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a room key you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go up!

I chose this hotel as I had visited New York in 2004 and had stayed there then. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted in a friendly manner. Check in was extremely quick and we were provided with the key to our room. The room was a deluxe double room. I had booked this trip as a surprise for my Boyfriends 30th Birthday and I actually emailed the hotel before arrival to make them aware of this and to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more special (cheeky I know but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get). As a result, they allocated us a newly refurbished room with views of Times Square. The room was very big and spacious as far as hotel rooms are concerned. The living area was big with a sofa and chair. There was a TV and the wardrobe was also a good size. The bathroom was clean and tidy. Some people might call the decor \"old\" however, this is a hotel with a fifties theme to it so the decor is new, however, is in a fifties style. I had read some reviews about bed bugs at hotels in New York, but i can guarantee there were none of these in our room. All hotel rooms were undergoing renovation. They were working on our floor while we were there but there was no disruption to us. The lifts at the hotel are great, there are several and they are extremely fast. The reception desk is very helpful and there is a dedicated information desk which is manned; we used this to ask where certain shops were and to get advice on restaurants. This was fantastic and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already have a map, they will provide you with one. The hotel has a large seating area which can be used when you are waiting to be picked up to go home- they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow suitcases or luggage in this area but there is a manned secure cloakroom to store your luggage on your last day once you have checked out, there is a small fee but well worth it. I think it was $2 per item. The hotel does have a cafe where you can get breakfast/lunch; however, the prices were quite high; although they generally were in that area of the city. We ended up having McDonalds breakfast a few days. Overall the hotel was excellent. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to New York to sit in your luxurious hotel room, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to explore the amazing city and the hotel is just a place to get your head down. While in New York, try to avoid being stopped by the salespeople in Times Square trying to sell you tickets to a comedy club. We made the mistake of stopping for the first one; they are very polite but they do tend to push you into buying tickets; we didn't on the basis we can see a comedy show at home and wanted to make the most of our time in NY seeing the sights. I would definitely recommend doing the following while in NY: 1. Seeing the statue of liberty. This is quite a way from the hotel and costs around $30 in a cab. There are several different trips: you can take the Staten Island ferry: this will go around the statue or you can take the Liberty Cruise and this will drop you off on Ellis Island. We opted for this. You get off at Ellis Island and can walk around the statue of liberty. It is amazing. The island is not too big but has a Cafe and a shop and amazing views off the city skyline. The minimum stay on the island is around 45 minutes, and then the ferry will return you to the Mainland. You can also choose to go up the statue into the crown. Be aware, tickets sell out for this quickly so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to book in advance. 2. Go to Top of The Rock. The Rockefeller centre is amazing and i must say has must better views than the Empire State. We went up around Midday and the views were fantastic. You can see the whole of Central Park and beyond and a bonus us you can actually see the Empire State. 3. Empire State Building. It is worth going up the empire state, it is totally different to the Rockefeller Centre. We went up here at the night. Be warned, it gets cold and windy up there in the winter months so wrap up warm. Views at night are great. 4. Central Park. This is a must. The park is huge so we took a ride on a rickshaw and were given a 45 minute tour of the park, stopping at Strawberry fields (the John Lennon memorial) and also at the \"Friends Fountain\". The mark was amazing and the drivers generally have fantastic knowledge of the park and tell you all about its history. The ride was $100 for 45 minutes but you do have to barter with the drivers or you could end up paying more. 5. Fifth Ave. If shopping is your thing, fifth ave is the place to go. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riddled with designer shops. FAO Schwartz is fab if you have children, full of toys and the children can play on the giant piano similar to the one from \"Big\" the movie. Tiffany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is also on Fifth Ave, i have one word for this: AMAZING. Watch out though, there are no prices displayed so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth asking before committing to buy as things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come cheap. There is an array of shops here and we used a full afternoon and evening exploring. The shops are generally open until around 8pm. 6. Ground Zero. This is no longer an awful scene of carnage and rubble; this is now the site of a new tower of hope. It is close to the Statue of Liberty ferry so we combined the Liberty trip with this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very humbling to see. Across the way there is a shop called Century 21, this is stocks designer clothes at high street prices. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to have a rummage you can get some great deals. Abercrombie and Fitch are also not far away. 7. Underground. No trip to NYC would be complete without going on the underground to grand central station. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very quick and easy to buy tickets but if you are unsure there are people around to help. Grand Central station is amazing, definitely worth a visit. There are many many more things to do in NYC but one thing i would recommend is to plan your trips. This will ensure you get the most out of your time and manage to fit everything in. Restaurant wise, we ate at Hard rock Cafe in Times Square a few times, this was lovely but there is usually a wait of around an hour for a table. Food is amazing and portions are huge. Price is like eating at somewhere like Frankie and Bennies or TGI's in the UK so average really. We also used a small steak house and a pizza and salad bar which were equally as nice. The food is the most expensive thing in NYC so always best to look out for offers as you can end up getting stung with the bill, and there is then a service charge on top. New Yorkers do generally get tipped 15% minimum. Once more thing, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in a black private taxi, you will get ripped off. Always use the yellow cabs. Overall we had an amazing time, it was the trip of a lifetime, but oh boy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s none stop and very tiring but worth it by far.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEven the location couldn't make up for this!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ACTW", "ReviewID": "UR117599441", "Content": "I was told when I booked this hotel that it was a three star... ha!

The top cover on the bed was dirty - I took this off straight away, there were hair grips all over the floor clearly meaning it hadn't been hoovered, there were long black hairs stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom, pubic hairs in the draw and writing on the mirror in the bathroom. I was upset it wasn't what I had received in other three star hotels in NYC. In fact it was that unclean I didn't unpack! Outside there was lots of noise, workmen (which I know can't be helped) and the binmen were outside very late - I think I slept with one eye open! I decided I would let the management know about the uncleanliness the following morning. However, at quarter to eight on our first morning I heard a suitcase been wheeled along the corridor, it stopped outside the door and someone used a keycard to get in our room, not once but about four times even though I was shouting 'hello'. Luckily it was still deadbolted from the night so they realsied we were in there, but really checking out your room while you are in there - not good - what if it had been the middle of the day and with that I quickly got ready and checked into another hotel for the following two nights in New York.

We bought some febreze which helped the smell, but there was no solution to the a/c. That week was so hot, we really wish it worked. Nevermind, though - we had a cold shower every night which really helped. The location is great. So close to times square (closer than we thought) but we couldnt hear it. There was construction across the street all night, but we wore ear plugs anyway, so that wasn't a problem. It was clean, and the bed was comfy (the rollaway was what you'd expect). The bellhop who helped us as we left was so kind, and told us all about the hotel's past famous guests. We ate at Cafe Edison every morning, which was perfect for what we needed!! We'd return, but only if we weren't going in the summer. The lack of air conditioning made the room too hot!", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean - only positive word to describe it\u201d", "Author": "hodgsons-choice", "ReviewID": "UR116704817", "Content": "A disappointing stay - which is a shame because the hotel has the raw material to be great - the art deco style and location.

In July we were one of the many that had no air-conditioning or hot water- for three full days. It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that it took two full days before they finally came clean and posted a sign in the elevator as to what was going on.

We NEVER got air back, and when we finally got hot water back on the last day, the lamp in the bathroom burned out plunging the room into darkness! It was comical how bad it was.

This hotel seems to be very popular with international tourists and tour groups from Europe. As always, I will provide the Pros & Cons for this hotel. Pros: The hotel is right in the heart of Times Square. There are many hotels in NYC who have \"Times Square\" as part of their name but they can be 10 blocks away sometimes and when you venture that far away from Times Square late at night, it can be a bit scary. All NYC hotels are expensive and you will find this hotel much cheaper than most that are anywhere near Times Square. With taxes, I paid around $235. Ok, you now have the only two reasons to stay at this place which are location & price. Cons: The lobby is ok but the rooms are very small. I realize that most international people reading this may not be familiar with this reference, but the inside of the room and bed remind me of a Cheap Motel 6. The bed was very uncomfortable and needed replaced, the windows did not insulate much from all the street noise below even though I was on the 18th floor. The worst part which prompted me to review them on Trip Advisor is the amount of Mold that was growing on the wall of the shower. There is no excuse for any hotel to have that and the entire wall was covered with it. Disgusting! I heard people complaining that their air conditioning was not working in their room as well. My worked fairly well but I had to leave it on maximum the entire time I was there just to keep it reasonably cool. Overall: I am not suggesting that nobody should stay here. The pros for some people might outweigh the cons so I will leave it up to your personal preference. I had to go on the hotel website to pay my $10 for internet service and the hotel room pictures they show are laughable as they are the furthest from what my room looked like as they could be. Maybe they have a suite or two in the hotel that looks like that but I have never seen that either time I stayed there. New York is a must see city and I love going there.

It was my very first flight and in a moment of madness decided to visit New York: the place of my dreams. We had reviewed many hotels on the net and had viewed Times Square through the live-earth cam. Because we had no experience of staying at hotels outside the UK, we chose the Edison because it looked and sounded ideal for our holiday; proximity to Times Square and Broadway. The arrangements were made through Expedia and we flew with Continental Airlines: I will not go into the personal fear and anxiety that the flight cost me. We actually met the pilot while we were waiting to board at Edinburgh. I was silently weeping into my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shoulder at the time. The pilot assured me that he would deliver us safely to New York. Jim and I have nothing but the highest praise for the Edison Hotel and all the staff that we came into contact with on our first and this past stay. I could run out of superlatives; kindness, courtesy, good humour and nothing was too much trouble. The concierge, reception and the security men were so helpful and attentive. Jim and I enjoyed our little chats by the elevator bank when we returned from our latest adventure. Especially on the occasion of having been kissed by Robin Williams after watching his magnificent performance. The trip this year was my retirement present to myself and to my hero, husband and navigator, Jim. We chose the Edison again because we knew that we would be welcomed as valued guests. We are now back home in Scotland but we are still buzzing with the romance and thrill of it all. Everything about the holiday, every minute of every day, was an exciting revelation to us. We had managed to extend our holiday by one more day than last year, but it all went by so quickly. However, we did manage to pack in four plays (you can maybe imagine how it felt when we saw and actually spoke to such amazing actors from T/V and the movies) Stomp and two films, as well as many landmark locations. I could carry on indefinitely as New York has captured our imagination and our hearts. I would just like to say how much I admired the plumbing . One quick flush and no noisy tank filling up. Just one little thing to mention, which is not a criticism: this year we did not have a chest of drawers in our room and we had to keep most of our clothes in the cases. Looking on the bright side, it did keep them nice and flat: we also loved the wide screen television and the high level of housekeeping.

The hotel itself is a bit old fashioned - art deco style - not my taste and the furniture could do with updating in the rooms but it was clean and spacious - there were 2 adults & 2 teens in our room with 2 double beds & there was still enough room to move about. We didn't have a safe in our room but there is free safety deposit at reception available 24/7 which we made good use of - at all times of the day.

With all the shopping in the area you probably wouldn't bother with the hotel shop - but do have a look - it was actually pretty reasonable & I got a couple of things in there cheaper than in nearby shops! We stayed 4 nights which I think is the minimum you should have for New York, especially if you've not been before (we'd been once before but still filled our time) - most tour operators seem to offer a 3 night package but that's hard going, I'd really recommend an extra one or 2 nights to really get the best from your trip!

Our check in, despite arriving quite late was very smooth and we were allocated a room on a higher floor as requested. All staff from the doorman to desk and security were polite and very helpful. We had a family room with two queen beds, it was spacious and very clean and had a great view of times square as we were on the back of the hotel.

The first night we did struggle with noise from what appears to be a heating system at the back of the hotel but after that it didn't bother us at all.

I would recommend the Edison Diner for breakfast , great choice and very reasonable, might even see an odd celebrity or two as we did !!

I went with a group of friends and we wanted to ensure we had as much funds available for all the sights and shopping we wanted to do that we ensured we curbed our accomodation costs. The lobby was clean and the staff when we arrived were very helpful. We shared a suite and it was on the top floor. All suites are located on the top 2 floors and these floors have not yet undergone refurbishment like most of the other floors. As a result our room was pretty outdated and tacky in places. The carpets needed a good clean and the bathroom had seen better days (not helped that it was all white - well use to be). This aside though, when in NYC you barely spend anytime in the hotel other than to sleep. If you are not out eating, drinking or shopping then you are out seeing the fabulous sights that the Big Apple has to offer. This hotel is in a location that shoes NYC in its best light. I have stayed in a number of different parts of Manhatten and Times Square has undoubtedly been my favourite.

We booked a transfer through the hotel with a really nice girl @ the Edison (was about $22 per person).

Finding an affordable hotel is. Unless of course you stay at a place in a neighborhood that is lit in red or requires a black belt in karate just to make it to your room.

Driving by, even walking by, you may not notice it. Although it's smack dab in the middle of Times Square, it's tucked away on a side street -- 228 West 47th Street to be exact -- just off Broadway. And even though it houses more than 800 rooms, its fa\u00c3\u00a7ade is amazingly deceptive. Sandwiched between an expensive W Hotel and a clothing store, it's barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. The depth of deception is dizzying. The monstrous building is nearly a city block in diameter but because of the way it was built in 1929, it snakes its way backwards and upwards hiding its bulk between neighboring buildings. As a result, rooms offer more peace and quiet than one might expect from the traditionally noisy 24-hour New York chaos, especially in the heart of Times Square.

When we spotted the Edison, we couldn't believe our eyes! The doorman welcomed us and check-in was a breeze! This hotel retains much of the elegance of the art nouveau era in its common areas downstairs. It is obvious that they are working hard on gradual updates. True, the rooms are dated, but are certainly clean and adequate. An added bonus to us was finding that Restaurant Row was right outside our door. Literally! We enjoyed a fabulous dinner at The French Quarter and then breakfast the following morning at the Edison Cafe. The cafe was a little pricey, but it's NY and remember, there was an ice storm outside. The food was nothing to rave about, but we were thrilled to have such convenience on a lousy day! At theatre time, we packed up and walked a block to the theatre!

The bathroom was very small, but I don't have any time for people who complain about barely being able to turn around in it. You shower in there and go to the toilet. You don't go ballroom dancing. If I had one complaint it would be that the glazing was really poor, and let in a lot of noise, and draft, which in New York in January is a bit on the cold side. Also, the heating system made quite a noise when you turned it on. Other than that, though, I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. We didn't pay much, and I got a decent hotel in a fantastic location.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money, superb location, clean & efficient\u201d", "Author": "SteveRBristol", "ReviewID": "UR93039464", "Content": "Superbly placed just about 80 mtrs from the ticket outlet right on Times Sq.

We decided to book the Edison after visiting several websites and all the photos looked good, it seemed to have light airy rooms and seemed to be a hotel that would have lets say the personal touch. We arrived at the hotel very excited especially as this was my first time in new york, the location of the hotel was amazing couldnt fault that at all, doorman was very friendly and helpful, we checked in at reception we had booked a queensize bed room, we went to the room if you could call it a room!!!! it was more like a dark hole I burst into tears it was tiny, really dark, and smelt unclean. The bathroom you could hardly turn around in I turned on the tap at the sink and for about 6 minutes the water was dark brown!!!! I rang down to front desk and got our room changed. Again the room was small the wall paper was hanging off the walls and there was mould over the bathroom tiles, we changed rooms again this time to a larger room again this was dirty there was hair on he bedding, crumbs on the floor along with a hair band on the floor and a bath which hardly had any enamel left on it, I went down to reception again i felt awful complaining but none of the rooms were decent I have never been fussy but this was really bad. The lady on reception desk was very helpful and changed our room this time to a suite, which was clean and decent. We settled ourselves in and got to sleep that was until there was really loud banging noises coming from the bathroom turns out it was old piping for the water and heating. This wasnt really a problem we are both heavy sleepers and we were hardly in our room as we had so much to see and do. Boxing day we had a lot of snow and our flight on which was meant to be on the 28th december got cancelled. We had only reserved our room up until the 28th so we rang reception who told us that we would have to move rooms and check out to check back in this was fine so we packed our things and headed down to reception. It was very busy but this was no excuse for the way in which we were dealt with by the male receptionist. He informed us that there was a room available but nothing available for new years eve!!!! the earliest flight for us to leave was the 1st January!! But that there was internet access on the 2nd floor, so off we went to find a hotel that could accomodate us until the 1 st January, and to our suprise we found availability at the edison!!!!! Our new room was ok again unclean bed lot of hair on it, one unclean towel in the bathroom!!! The maid came up and changed the bed and towels as soon as we rang but we were just made to feel like it was our problem. I just found most of the staff to be too busy to be kind, friendly and helpful!!!! This hotel and the staff weren't acceptable and left me feeling highly disappointed!!!!!

We ended up staying in both an outdated room and a updated one and they were both clean. The lobby was very nice and decorated beautifully for christmas. Checking in and out was a breeze! In fact, we were checking out after our two night stay and thought we should tell them about a small ceiling leak in our room that may become a big problem if it wasn't fixed quickly. Well, the girl at the desk asked if it caused us any damage and we said no, she then went on to tell us that she was taking a night off for the inconvience. At first 8 thought she was kidding because we were really just telling them for their benefit. Later that day we decided to take advantage of the savings and stay another night. When checked in again, another girl was so kind to give us the AAA discount which we don't have, which made the room $109 that night. Anyhow, I highly recommend this hotel and already have to my friends. Also, just a few more suggestions....don't get sucked into spending a ridiculous amount of money to the chain restaurants in time square! If you just walk down to 8th ave and take a look around at menu's, you'll find good food at reasonable prices. Also, restaurant row is on 46th st and they always seem to have specials during the day.

This has a great location since it is 1/2 block from Times Square and the bus stops for the tour buses. Our interactions with the hotel staff were all positive and they were helpful in providing the safety deposit box services at the main desk. We gave the room a 3 rating because of its size. It might be comparable to an inside cabin on a cruise ship with a window. This room would be OK for one, but is tight for two adults. We gave a 3 on sleep quality because the mattress was old and firm. The hotel was clean given its age. We would recommend Sophias, the restaurant attached to the hotel. The genre of the restaurant is Italian. We also used precautions for bed bugs. We placed our luggage on the luggage stand, the ironing board and the desk. Clean clothes were kept in zip lock bags in the luggage and we had no signs of bed bugs upon our return home. You can get to the hotel from JFK by taking the Air Train to Jamaica Center. From there, take the E subway train to 50th street. Walk towards 47th Street on 8th Avenue and turn left on 47th. The Edison will be about 1/2 block on your right. Be sure to have luggage with good wheels. You can return to the airport the same way. For the return, exit the main door to your left and turn right on 8th avenue. Turn Right on 50th street to enter the subway for the E train. BE AWARE that after you go through the turn styles, you will need to go down one more level for the E train on the stairway located to the right of the turn styles. On the return trip to JFK, you will exit at the SUTPHIN street stop, NOT the Jamaica Center stop. We felt safe on the subways during the day. The cost for this method of travel is $7.25 as of 10/10/10 ($5 for air train and $2.25 for subway). If you are able to lift your luggage over the turn styles, this is may be a cheaper alternative to the shuttles and taxis. As footnotes, the TODAY show is about 20-30 minutes walking time depending on the lights and how fast you can walk.

We eventually got allocated a room on the 19th floor and off we went. On exciting the elevator we were met with a grubby looking corridor and the doors to the rooms we passed including ours all looked badly in need of painting and dirty as did the whole corridor. We entered our room and I was instantly shocked at how small it was and how grubby it looked, upon inspection we found it had not been cleaned the bins in the bathroom and main room had not been emptied, sweet wrappers under the bed and the carpet was filthy. The bed was not a proper bed just a mattress on a rolling frame, on the plus side it had been made, there were cables running all around and across the room coming from overloaded sockets that looked very unsafe, and the heater was hanging off the wall. All the furniture in the room looked grubby and the tv stand was broken.

I was at this point tired, hungry and losing patience and on advice from my wife left it. As we only had that night and the following night to put up with we tidied the room ourselves, made sure we left nothing plugged in, that would have been hard as there were no free sockets and we had to unplug a lamp to charge phones etc. Also the towels are paper thin and the carpet was so bad you could not walk on it barefoot after a shower. On the plus side we encountered no bed bugs and the reception area looked nice, also the bar attached to the hotel was friendly with a great barman, however this is closing at the end of September.

There was also a closet. So it was a comfortable albeit small room. The bathroom was decent, with provisions of shampoo and soap. Areas of improvement: 1. The air-conditioning. Not quite the kind you can tweak with numbers, and even at it's coolest, the room still felt a little warm at times in the hot summer. If you're the kind that feels hot easily, or likes to sleep in cold conditions, it may not be sufficient for you. 2. There wasn't a fridge or a safe. We ended up cooling our drinks with ice and an ice box bucket (available on the 2nd floor). 3. The temperature in the shower would fluctuate from time to time and the water pressure was a little low. 4. The mattress was a little soft, which is not great when you've been walking for hours and need to rest your back well. 5. The view was bad. We were on the 4th floor and looked out into a parking garage and the back of the next building was very close to us. But apart from the air-conditioning, I think it was generally good value for money, considering I only paid US$186 a night (at wotif.com). For that price, I don't expect a 5-star room and amenities.

No air conditioning in hallways and elevators so it`s pretty stuffy. Did not hear the neighbours but we could hear the elevator`s bell. Toilets are quite powerful! Beds were okay, Melatonin helped for sleep! Kuddos for housekeeping as my son had an accident and wet the bed... They had everything cleaned up very quickly. The hotel store is the pits.. looks like more of a storage area as it`s tiny and everything is crammed in there. Went to get some sodas and I stubbed my little toe on a case of soda on the floor along the wall. Lobby is neat and old-fashioned. Security did there thing and responds well with a hello. Had 2 breakfasts at the Edison Cafe. Waiters are older and kind of grumpy but the portions were normal-sized and prices were moderate. Be careful as the tip is already accounted for in the bill! We got caught with that one the first time we went... The umbrella-strollers were a life saver for us for our 6 and 4 year olds as you can pretty much walk everywhere but the kids get tired. Took the subway which was safe and quite exciting for the kids. All in all, we would go again. Travelling with little ones makes you lower your expectations of how much you can do but the kids managed quite a lot. Did manage to hit Time Square, Central Park and the Zoo, Staten Island Ferry to view Statue of Liberty, walked Wall St., 9/11 site, Dylan`s Candy Store, FAO Schwartz, Toy`s R Us, Nintendo World, Top of the Rock, 5th Avenue..

After reading the mixed reviews on the hotel, we were a little apprehensive. However we couldn`t have asked for more so I say go with an open mind. 5 Star , it certainly isn`t but it does not claim to be. Yes if you want to be really picky, it is a little frayed round the edges but we did not go to NYC to look at the paintwork or to spend most of the day in the hotel! We were celebrating our wedding anniversary on our trip so I e mailed in advance to ask them to consider this when allocating our room. When we checked in, the hotel had upgraded us to a suite for free which was a lovely surprise. The room was pleasant, clean and comfortable with a view of Times Square to die for. The bed was comfortable and we both slept like babies at night totally unable to hear any of the madness that is Times Square. Plenty of storage space for that essential shopping. Bathroom was a little on the small side for the size of the rest of the room but had a brilliant power shower with plenty of hot water at all times. No safe in the room for your valuables but free safes were available behind reception so really if any of your valuables go missing from your room, you really only have yourself to blame for not using this free service. The staff that we had contact with could not have been more friendly or helpful. Reassured by the fact that you have to show your room key to security to gain acess to any of the elevators that lead to the floors. Overall would definitely recommend this hotel. It was great value for money with a location ( literally 50 yds from Times Square) that cannot be beat. If you are not interested in paying the earth for a hotel but just want a good, comfortable clean and friendly base to enjoy all the great things that NYC has to offer, you will find the Hotel Edison hard to beat in our humble opinion.

The people were very friendly, from the doorman, who we got to know just over the weekend, and the bellhop Joseph. The total experience was very pleasurable. We spent a Friday and Saturday night at the Edison. Friday night we went to see an opera at the Met and walked back, down 8th Avenue. We had adinner at Becco's on Restaurant Row, also in the neighborhood. Saturday we headed up to the park and the Met Museum to see the Big Bamboo and Picasso exhibit. The subway for uptown is right around the corner. We saw \"Lend Me a Tenor\" Saturday evening. The play I would suggest also, it was a comedy. The location to walk over to the theatre was just a short walk through the Marriott Marquis alley . After theatre we had dinner in a neighborhood eatery.

The shower had parts of tiles missing and around the plug the bath had lost it's colour so was showing rusty brown underneath. The shower dripped constantly but this wasn't the worst thing, when ever anyone used the taps the pipes would scream and rubble, this was particularly unpleasant at 6.30am.

Note if you want coffee/tea facilities they are not available in your room. We took a kettle and coffee with us as its nice to have a cuppa when you wake up. The cafe edison was very good value for money and we ate one night in the Sofia, although all the waiter seemed interested in was his tip! And the Sofia was quite expensive compared to the cafe edison. The security men on the door were a little brash and told me to \"get out of here\" when I questioned him in a joking way as to where we pick up the hop on hop off bus, but all taken in good fund. All in all if I was going back to New York I would definately stay at the Edison Hotel.

Sure, the bathroom was small, but there was ample hot water and again, very clean with change of towels each day etc. We were at the hotel for 4 nights and situated on the third floor at the back of the hotel...can't quite remember the room #, but think it was 323 or 333. The first night we were so tired from the flight, we slept soundly. Second night, we became aware of the air conditioning fans outside our window...were a little noisy but bearable. By the 4th night, it was unbelievable...the noise was incredible. We called front desk who told us they had nowhere to move us to as the hotel was fully booked and they would send some Engineers up to look at the problem. Two Engineers came up and were horrified at the noise emanating from these fans. They managed to decrease the noise considerably and it was bearable for us to sleep - luckily we had earplugs with us- and the hotel advised they would halve the room rate for that night. The bar at the hotel was excellent as was the small cafe there which we attended one morning for breakfast. The souvenir shop was good value with a great range of small gifts. The staff on the Concierge & Transportation Desks were excellent, giving us instructions on finding the closest Catholic Church and organizing transport to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal where we were catching a cruise from. The location is second to none and I would return to the Edison but would be insistent on not being accommodated in a room on the third floor at the back near the air conditioning fans.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "beachwood, ohio", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than I expected\u201d", "Author": "dbruening", "ReviewID": "UR47811211", "Content": "Yes its older, the showers have five handles, and the rooms are odd shapes, after all it was built as an aparatment and converted.

First, the hotel is nothing like the web site suggests. Not even close. Its much smaller, shabby looking, with a cold and unfriendly atmosphere. I am a frequent traveler and have never seen the kind of attitude the reception staff had. They were rude, never said please, thank you or smiled. They barked short little answers to any questions we had. They would not look up when a guest approached the desk but waited until we said, excuse me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. The security \u00e2\u20ac\u0153person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who was in front of the elevators always seemed to be more interested in talking to someone than checking out who was coming or going. And when he actually decided to check who was coming, he too would bark that he wanted to see the hotel key. I have never seen anything like this. No hotel should ever allow staff to behave this way to guests. Guests pay for the privilege of staying at these hotels. The staff of the Edison behaved as though they were bestowing a favor upon us by allowing us to be at the hotel. It was a disgusting experience. I did not see anyone tip any staff except the bellboys who were truly decent and courteous. No gifts or tips were offered to any front desk staff. I did not wonder why. The rooms were OK, but nothing spectacular and nothing like in the website. Cleanliness was not on the top of the list. Carpets had a line of stains, like wine or blood, the bathroom was so small, mold on the tiles in the tub, bathroom med cabinet was missing one mirror, the inner shelf which was constantly visible was rusted and disgusting. There was a very poor job of caulking around the tub, a partial caulking around the base of the sink \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was a gaping hole there. Everything in that bathroom looked in disarray, old and unattended. And we got the renovated room! I can only imagine what the rest of the rooms looked like. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, ever. I would certainly not attend this hotel, even for a meal. But the diner is a completely different story. Stay away from there too.

So to get down to the nitty gritty all I can say is that the rooms were clean on arrival and were attended daily, if you hang your dirty towels up they will not be relaced -so put them on bathroom floor when used and they will be replaced, There was hardly any street noise to be heard once inside the room so had a peaceful nights sleep - so raring to go next day ! The lobby clerk will not let you access the lifts to your room if you do not have a room key so keep it handy ( I found this comforting as we were 5 females and thought this to be a great security asset).

The combo room was 2 inter-connecting rooms that shared 1 bathroom, as there were 5 of us we requested a rollaway bed for the 5th person as it was 1 double bed per room , the second room without the bathroom had small sitting area there so you could relax. There is a deli just outside the hotel called Danny's that has a fantastic range of hot and cold food that you can either take up to your room or eat in the Deli ( there were some smokers in my group so each morning as they had the morning fix they would bring coffee and b/fast back with them ) On the whole a fantastic place to put your head down while visiting the City that never sleeps.

Thankfully the stay was no worse than the last time ( 5 yrs ago). As has been said many times before on Tripadvisor, if you want to stay somewhere nice in midtown you need to pay through the nose for it. Even then, the rooms are usually small and the staff are not very friendly. (friend of mine paid $350 per night in the Hudson, lovely room but no room to swing a cat). Thats why the Edison is pretty good for the location, just off Times Square. The room we were in was a standard twin, it didn't have a view except across onto the wall of the building next door and yes the room could of used some modernising. The bathroom especially was dated but the shower, although antiquated, had a really good pressure and there was never a shortage of hot water regardless of the time of day. I've stayed in many luxury hotels where they spend thousands on fancy bathrooms but can't manage to produce hot water when you actually want it. Therefore, i'd rather have a hot shower in an old bathroom than a cold shower in a brand new one!! The tiredness of the decor and furnishings shouldn't be mistaken for dirtyness - the room was actually very clean - I dropped something down behind the dresser the TV sat on and when I pulled it out to get the item back, I expected to find the usual layer of dust from the chamber maid not cleaning the \"out of sight\" areas, however the skirting and carpet were both dust free so obviously the room had been given a thorough cleaning recently. The sheets were changed once during our four night stay and the towels were changed daily, so can't complain about that. The only thing we did notice is that either it was the room or the hotel, but the power seemed to drop off for a fraction of a second from time to time - for example the radio alarm reset itself and I had to re-programme the time. Also, the TV flickered a few times and reset itself back onto the Hotel Welcome Channel. It wasn't an issue (unless you had set the alarm for your wake up call) and it wasn't really annoying, just peculiar. Also, since I first stayed there, I would say the staff are definately politer than before, with the exception of the girls on the concierge and transport desks - they were both as good as hopeless and needed some basic training in customer service. The security guys that check you have your keycard before getting into the lifts (especially at night), were all very friendly and were always chatty about what you'd been doing that day / night. All in all, anywhere else in the world i'd say this hotel is overpriced and not worth it, but unfortunately as everywhere in New York is overpriced, I would say for the location and the general amenities in the hotel then this hotel is definately not bad value for money.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burbank, CA", "Title": "\u201cNear everything\u201d", "Author": "pinkycats", "ReviewID": "UR42917441", "Content": "The Edison ,while not a Luxury hotel is just fine for the price.

We found out later that the hotel usually gets 2-3 complaints a week about bedbugs, even though they use an exterminator, etc. Clearly they are infested. I'll never stay there again, although my boyfriend--who is impervious to insect bites in general and was fine during our visit--has stayed there several times before this and says he will return.

Pros: 1 - Room size was very good by New York standards. 2 - Our bedding was changed daily and towels replenished. 3 - Staff, with the exception of the female concierge (I don't think she is capably of a smile!) I found all staff members to be very friendly and helpful. 4 - The shower was powerful and we always had plenty hot water - although in the evening it did take about 5mins to come through. Cons: 1 - The bedding may have been changed daily but our carpet was not hoovered once (any we were there for 5 nights) 2 - The TV didn't work properly, when switched on it would stay on for about 5mins then the lose signal and not come on again for up to 20mins - this was worse at night than in the morning. 3 - The decor of the room was terrible, there is a leaflet in reception showing rooms but our room was nothing like the pictures and looked as though it had not been decorated since the hotel was built. The corridors reminded me and my husband of the hotel in The Shinning and if a small boy on a bike or creepy looking twin girls appeared in front of us we wouldn't have been surprised! 4 - The only electrical socket int he room we could use was hanging off the wall and the only way we could get the power to flow was to put the plug into the socket and then push our suitcase in front to keep the plug and socket in place. 5 - The bathroom (although clean) had no form of ventilation meaning it filled with steam immediately, if you kept the door open the bedroom would get steamy even with the air conditioning unit at full power. 6 - No tea or coffee making facilities Overall the hotel was fine for all the time we were in it but you dont want to be dreading going back to your hotel after a long day in the city. If you dont care what your hotel looks like and dont mind wondering when the last time your room was cleaned then this place will be fine otherwise DONT STAY HERE. NYC recommendations I can pass on are: Danny's deli next to Edison is fine for breakfast and it was great for a cup of tea before heading back to the hotel. Restaurants/bars: Buddakan - al a carte Chinese food - excellent Dallas BBQ (time square) - Texas size drinks, huge portions and cheap prices - a great choice. Cafe Cluny (Greenwich Village) - we found this place while looking for somewhere else and glad we chose to eat there as it was a lovely little place Tao & Pastis - good cocktails Vento - downstairs bar Gansevoort Hotel - rooftop bar Blue Fin (Time Square) - good drinks and excellent for breakfast.

Its only a few steps to the lights of Times Square and the TKTS booth selling discounted theatre tickets for that day. It's a few blocks from a subway station, so we found it handier to walk to it when we arrived at Penn station, but it was a manageable 10-15 mins with luggage in tow. All the large shops are within an easy walk and there are some good quality, reasonably priced restaurants in the area, despite being bang in the middle of a tourist trap. Rooms New York is an expensive place to stay, and Midtown is the worst as you are paying for location, but \u00c2\u00a3125 a night for this place was depressing, all the more so as this was a good rate. The positives are that the room was a reasonable size but we had a corner room, which made ours bigger than the average, others we glimpsed looked pokey. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the main room appeared to be clean. However, the carpet had seen better days, it was old, worn and poorly fitted (creased at the edges and coming away from the skirting boards in places). The room was also very noisy - we were on the 16th floor and the noise level from outside would have made you think the windows were open, although they were closed with the curtains drawn! This was particularly unfortunate as on the first night of our stay road works where taking place on the street outside. The bathroom was small, old and had been repeatedly and poorly patched up (e.g. a pipe that had been painted and subsequently started peeling was wrapped in a 'decorative' wire mesh). On first inspection, the bath appeared to be exceptionally dirty around the plug hole. Inspection showed that the marks on the bath were pitting on the surface of the tub that couldn't be cleaned away. Some toiletries were provided but I wouldn't have liked to be relying on them as they were cheap and nasty sachets that weren't sufficient for two people. Everyone will tell you that money spent on a nice hotel in New York is wasted, and I have to agree. We could have paid \u00c2\u00a3100 a night more for somewhere like the Library hotel, which I imagine would be a pleasure to stay in, but we were staying for 5 nights and you can do a lot of other things with \u00c2\u00a3500! We did spend a minimal amount of time in the hotel room and while definately not a pleasure, it didn't do me any harm. Food The hotel is attached to what I suppose what would be called a diner. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large room, which has some prominent Art Deco features on the ceiling that the hotel sells itself on, however, the actual seating area is retro and not in an Art Deco way. We ate here for breakfast each morning. It was busy, but it never took longer than a few minutes to get a table. Breakfast was typically around $15 for two and consisted of fruit juice, tea/coffee and pancakes/waffles. The quality was fine, for breakfast, however we didn't eat any other meals there - the dinner menu was unappealing and we were looking for something nicer in the evenings. Value for money In comparison to other cities, I would say the quality of the room and the price represented poor value for money. However, it's New York and having researched the other hotels in that \"nothing fancy, 3*\" range, I would say the rate and hotel represented reasonable value.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location in New York\u201d", "Author": "chocaholicmanc", "ReviewID": "UR38678087", "Content": "The Edison was in such a fantastic area of New York.

The size of the bathroom was okay, not a lot of room for your stuff, but we just used the table in the room. We had a walk in closet, so plenty of room for our clothes and to store our luggage. The location was absolutely perfect! Walk out of the lobby on the 47th Street side and look your right. You can see the TKS booth. Look to your left and see the theatre where Rock of Ages is playing. Go out on the 46th street side and look to your left. There is the theater for the Little Mermaid (until Aug. 30) and straight ahead is In the Heights. SOOO Close to everything. Additionally, if you go out 46th street side and go to the right, that is restaurant row. Walk 2-3 blocks and you will see all kinds of food choices. The Gray Line bus tour is also right at the end of the block. You can walk to the Empire State Building (15 min), Rockefeller Center (10 min), Time Square (1 min), Pier 84 (Circle line cruises, 15-20 min), Subway (2-5 min) Our package included breakfast in the cafe. You get your choice of eggs (fried or scrambled) & bacon, pancakes or french toast. We had all three and all were delicious and plentiful. We did ask for a refrigerator prior to going to this hotel. We were told that we could only get one if there was a medical purpose. There are no ice machines, so if you plan on having drinks in your room, you might want to bring a small cooler. My husband put our drinks right in front of the air conditioner and put the curtains around them for insulation. He called it our refrigerator. It worked out just fine and was a joke throughout the vacation. Other than check-in and check-out, we had no reason to interact with the staff. We did not experience any problems, so no need to contact anyone. We did not have extra charges on our bill. My ONLY complaint is that the beds were hard. The first night I noticed, the second and third I was too tired to care! The bathroom did not have ventiltaion and we had some condensation on the walls and ceiling. At one point water dripped on me, but I just dried the area around me. Please remember that this is an old hotel and it is not perfect. If you want to spend $300, go to the Marriott around the corner. If you want just as good of a location for $150, then keep an open mind and spend your extra money on theater tickets or a great meal!

Upon arrival and checking in, it was apparant that our room wasn't large enough and had no seperate sleeping area for ourselves. However, a quick visit to the front desk and they upgraded our room to a deluxe suite without any hesitation. We were also due to meet some friends later in the day who were staying at the same hotel with their young family and they put us in adjoining rooms. Perfect. We asked for a fridge to put provisions and cold milk for the boy - they agreed to provide one and despite it being reconditioned and about 15 years old, it worked perfectly! We also decided to stay an extra night on a Saturday and this was offered at the same rate as used during the week. The location is why you stay at Edison Hotel, no other reason, it's 20 yards from Times Square and has everything you would need for a comfortable night's sleep. If you want deluxe then go next door to the 4 star hotel where you can pay an extra \u00c2\u00a3100+ per night just to sleep the same amount of hours! As it's room only, for breakfast, we were able (thanks to the fridge) to bring cereal into the room and have that for breakfast as well as visiting Danny's Deli next door and bring bagels etc up to the room without any interference from security/front desk. In addition, towards 8th avenue there's several other diners where breakfast is served at good prices.

We reserved hotel directly from hotel's own web pages and had a few emails confirming few things about our room. Or rooms to be exact. We had a great two-bedroom mini-suite with separating doors for privacy for us and for wife's cousin. Price was right because we could reserve room so early. Arriving to hotel was pleasant. There were doorman who helped us with our luggage. Reception was also very easy. Everything was correct with our reservation and smile was on with receptionist. We also got help with luggage all the way to the room. Rooms were ok, not luxurious and not bad. Old but very clean and well maintained. Carpets were living their last remaining years. Otherwise everything worked, hair dryer, TVs, remotes and heaters. Heaters almost too well. Weather outside happened to be coldest since and heaters were giving their best. Bathroom was also old and small but again very clean. Bathtub had same rust stains under faucets but otherwise spotless. Hot water didn't run out and bathroom was warm but amazingly dry place after showers. Towel supply was good and rooms were cleaned every day. A BIG Thanks to cleaners. Views from rooms were not anything special. Windows were looking over roof tops over the narrow streets. Hotel is not a skyscraper so other buildings block the views. Nights were peaceful. Only once we woke up in the middle on the night with a banging noice. I looked out and saw some workers below us, building a tin roof and hammering it, at 2 o'clock in the morning! We were also not near the elevators so no noices from there. And enough elevators there were. You didn't have to wait for too long. Noices from Times Square didn't reach us or didn't bother. On the other hand Times Square is right there on the corner, half block from hotel door. You are so close to everything you need, restaurants, shop, bars and theaters. One theater is right across the street. Subway station is also near. Hotels own restaurant/bar Cafe Edison was a nice place. Food was ok, we tested it on one morning for breakfast. Usually we had breakfast and lunch out in the city. I think this hotel is suitable for those who need a place to change clothes and sleep between shopping and Broadway shows and dining out. But it's not too old place just to stay in, if you just need a rest for a change. One thing about NYC in January or in winter overall. Make sure you have enough warm clothes to wear. We are from Finland, Europe and we are used to having cold winters but it wasn't anything in comparison to this what we experienced in January. Cold wind from North with cold Atlantic ocean together is mix to be aware of. It can give you frostbites if you're not prepared. Ask the doudle-decker guide if heater is working. We got one bus with no heating and we were quite surprised for the temperature. Wife's cousin and i got flu, but what the heck, we got something to remember at least!

The lobby and lounge are beautiful with many art deco features. The lounge had a massive Christmas tree right in the centre of it which was stunning. The sofas in the lounge were large and overstuffed and, if I'm honest, a bit threadbare in places but to me it just sort of added to the whole character of the place. There is a small shop just next to the lounge area which sells just about anything you can think of ... t-shirts, candy, cold drinks, medicines ... it's just crammed with goodies and we found their prices very comparative with other souvenir shops around Times Square. Our room was at the back of the hotel on the fourth floor. It was very quiet, more than adequate in size, VERY clean and it had a brilliant walk in closet to store all our bargains from Woodbury Common in. I didn't think the bathroom was that small and certainly not a lot smaller than any bathroom you would find in a modern U.K. home. The only disadvantage with being on the fourth floor was the lifts (or elevators) were more often than not full to bursting by the time they arrived at our floor in the morning, but it wasn't too much hassel as we just used the stairs. We never ate breakfast in the hotel as the queue was always backed up into the lobby of the hotel. We went to Danny's, a deli next door which was fantastic. The food is freshly made, tasty and very reasonable. We did have dinner in the hotel restaurant just once, the special set menu was a bit uninspiring and the waiter overbearing but the food was okay. The location of the hotel is perfect for a first trip to New York or for returning visitors. It is close to Times Square and Broadway, the Rockafeller Centre, the subway and just four blocks from the Port Authority Terminal where you can catch a coach to Woodbury Common, a must for any visitor.

After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we were a little apprehensive before our trip. However, we had a fantastic stay at the Edison. Our room was on the 14th floor and it was quite large with a handy hallway and closet (great for storing shopping bags). The bathroom was quite small (as i imagine most are) but was clean and looked new. Considering the hotel is in Times Square, it wasn't noisy at night. (just the odd siren and horn honking which is usual). Would have liked a better view, but you cant have everything!! The lobby was nice with a nice seating area and the Piano bar was how you would imagine an authentic american bar. We only popped in there once for a quick drink, but had we had more time we would have probably gone again. Sofias italian restaurant adjoins the back of the hotel, again, we didnt have chance to go in, but it looked really nice and busy. We sampled the Edison cafe one morning, not overly keen on the breakfasts. We discovered Dannys (just a couple doors away from front of hotel) which does the most amazing all day cuisine. They have a breakfast run, then it all changes for lunch and then dinner. Lovely full breakfasts, or fresh fruit, bagels, just everything. We were gutted we had only discovered it on the last day and we had walked past it about 50 times!!. As for the location of the hotel WOW!!! Walk to the end of the street and you are in Times Square. Walk out the back entrance and you are in Times Square. Just fab!! So convenient after a day out to drop bags off, and go out again. Also,in the evenings, you could go elsewhere, then come back and go out again to Times Square. One bit of advice though, if you go to the Marriott revolving bar (come out of back of hotel and enter Marriott) do not go for the evening buffet. The food is awful and not worth the money. But it is nice to go for a drink there as the bar revolves 360 degrees 48 floors high so you see all of NYC! Try Bubba Gumps in Times Square. Fun dining experience. This was our second trip to NY, so we didnt really do all the sights again, mainly shopping although we did walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and back again ( a total must as the views of Manhattan on the way back are breathtaking especially at sunset, also try Grimaldis pizza place under the bridge on the Brrooklyn side) and we went to Central Park again which is just gorgeous. The top of 5th Avenue by Central Park and Tiffanys, Plaza Hotel etc is just proper NYC, just like in the films. Went to Woodbury Common this time, got some great bargains. Stayed at the Belvedere Hotel last time which was just as good so would recommend either hotel. Please dont worry about staying at the Edison, it is totally fine and a great price (unless they have some dodgy rooms which we didnt stay in). Christmas time in New York is just magical.

The hotel itself is very old and in my opinion could do with a complete overhaul as the whole place is very dingy and grimy looking--a very unfriendly lobby greets you when you arrive along with equally unfriendly,cold reception staff.We were staying on the 6th floor and the lift came in handy and i have to say this was very efficient and fast although some times we took the stairs on the way down as you could wait 20 minutes until a lift stopped where you could squeeze in.The corridor was dull and dingy also and then on entering the room this was was even darker and was a bit foisty smelling (room 647).The room was very small all the drawers creaked or squeaked when opened,the 1 electric socket available had dodgy connections as it only worked when it felt like it and to save risking an electric shock-it was best not to use it.There were 2 lamps in the room that had to be on all the time you were in as the room was so dark as the window looked onto a brick wall.The waterworks in the bathroom were not up to much --the hot water was intermittent and a cold shower is not very desirable in October. The one decent thing was the maid service,they came each day we were there and were very friendly. Downstairs there is a cafe for breakfast--reasonably priced but not sure if my husband became ill from the poached egg that he ate in the morning(it seemed undercooked to me) and its a bit like a cattle market--your second course arrives before you have finished the first.

If you like staying in a comfy, spacious, modern room, you're in the wrong place.

The first two nights were OK but the last night, we had really noisy neighbours who enjoyed watching TV late and loud and we realized the wall were quite thin. so if you're unlucky enough to get careless neighbours you could be in for a bad night. Secondly, the hotel was implementing a new pay per view system and it was clearly not working. They charged us for a movie we were supposed to have been watching and when we complained at the desk they made some research to find that the movie was viewed in our room at a time we were still in a restaurant. They agreed it was a mistake but told us they could'nt do nothing and had to make an official inquiry. It was two months ago and we are still waiting for a refund. Not really encouraging.

The bathroom and closet doors did not shut properly, nor did the bathroom door lock. Not too great when you have people comming and going at different times of the day. Now on to the shower. This had to be the worst shower that I have ever used in a hotel. The water went from cold to hot and vice versa. No happy medium. The shower acted like a garden hose. Not that great.

They advised that the hot water was good enough, but every morning we would let it run for about 15 minutes before the hot water would kick in and then you did not need to run the cold tap either to have a shower. I then asked where our cot was and they told me to ring housekeeping, after 3 phonecalls and 2hrs later our cot arrived with no blankets and just a sheet. I also asked reception about our bathroom light as we could not find a light in our bathroom... They advised that every room was different and we would have to work it out for ourselves... after 2 days of darkness, we realised we had found our light switch, but the light did not work unless you shake the fitting... so that worked out...

It retains all of it's old charm and you can just imagine being there when the hotel was first built. The rooms are spacious and clean with plenty of storage, but some rooms may be a wee bit dark depending on what room you get. There is a walk in closet where you can hang your clothes and store your cases (and where the iron & board and phone books are stored just in case you need the use of them) The maid comes in everyday to clean and change the towels. The room also has an air conditioning unit which you can also use to heat the room if you're feeling a wee bit chilly. As the hotel has many floors there are six lifts which you don't spend any time waiting for as they are very quick. I was very surprised at the speed of the lifts when I first got into them, so you're not wasting any of your precious holiday time. The Edison is right in the heart of Times Square which is the best place to be if it's your first time in New York. When you exit the hotel by the main entrance and turn right you are only a few yards away from Times Square and when you turn left when you exit the hotel you are only two streets away from Hells Kitchen. The staff are polite and helpful and there is 24 hour housekeeping just in case you need it, which I did and they were very prompt. You may be asked by a member of staff for to show your room key just before you get into the lift which I found really good as it was reassuring that no one who wasn't meant to be there was going to gain access to any of the floors.

Rooms- Rooms were very simple and clean to stay in. bedrooms differ all throughout of the hotel so I can't really state every rooom as they differed. My room was on the 12th floor of the hotel and was a good sized as had 3 other students I was stayed with. The bed room had two large beds, t.v, chester draws, bedside cabanet, a table and chair, and two little sofas to look outside the window from. The bathroom was supplied with fresh towels daily and also had a hair dryer included. Although the rooms were perfect, we had some odd creatures in our bath but was no bother as we got rid of them.

The hotel had been recommended and did not disappoint us in any way. It may not be pure luxury but for the price we paid I thought it was fab and I didnt see one single hotel in the whole week that was in a better location for 1st time visitors than The Edison. Staff were all helpful when required and we found all that we needed right there. It has a cafe attached, a small piano bar to rest your weary feet and end the night with a much needed glass of wine, a large reception, very helpful concierge desk, travel arrangement desk (with very able but slightly abrupt arranger), loads of public telephones and a back entrance which takes you straight out to the TCKT booth for the cheap broadway show tickets and a nice Italian. Rooms were fine - clean, bigger than I expected having heard they are all tiny in NY and plenty of mirrors for 2 females who need one each. Bed was comfy enough although we were so tired at night I could have slept on the floor, bathroom was fine and shower really powerful. Clean towels were provided every day and the maids tidied up after us every day. New York itself was truly fab. We did all the usual sights and loved them all. Went to see 2 shows which were great - Legally Blonde and Chicago (girl who played Roxie was brilliant) - and shopped until the credit cards would let us go no further. We went the bus tour on the first morning and the tour guide told us to get to grips with the subway as it was so cheap ($25 for a weekly ticket) and really fast. We were a bit aprehensive at first but found it to be totally safe and by Day 2 we were completely unfazed. There are subway stations on almost every street corner. Loved the buzz of Chinatown - were there 3 times - and also found Ellis Island very moving. If you are only going to go up either the Rockerfeller Centre or the Empire State then my tip would be the RC. Much better views and you can see the Empire State and also Central Park - you cant believe how huge it is in the middle of all the concrete. The view is also uninterupted as it is clear perspex all round intead of wire fencing. Visit Ellens Stardust Cafe just up the road from the hotel on 7th Avenue. Typical American diner but with singing waiters and waitresses. We were in for breakfast one morning and they were up on the tables singing at 9am nd we were in one night after a show and they were still there. Great atmosphere and the food is pretty good.

This time I went along as well as our two teen aged children. This hotel is in the BEST area right off Broadway, so much within walking distance. The thing about the Edison is that the rooms are very different sizes, layouts. Only two people in our forty-some people group didn't like their room...only because they got twin beds instead of queen beds...jeez, they weren't even sleeping together. The Edison accommodated them by changing their room anyway. We had a double queen, very clean, bright and attractive. The bathroom was very small but we managed. My basic complaint was that the lobby, which is nice looking, very art-deco, had some gold-covered cloth sofas and chairs that looked like someone had died on them....ewwww. Dirty, stained, gross. I thought that was shameful and that they should replace them. I wouldn't even sit on them. The cafe is nice, they really work hard and the breakfasts are great. Desk people, security, all were decent, personable enough. Housekeeping brought us extra pillows when we requested them (I am a housekeeping tipper too, I always leave a couple of dollars a day at least) Housekeeping did a great job, we were there for a full week and had no complaints. Oh yea, the mattress was really hard. My kids didn't mind them, but my husband and myself noticed it. I was a bit achy when I woke up in the morning, but it went away fast...and I must admit I slept like a rock. I'm sure that there are a few rooms with problems, but I would certainly complain if I found my room to be unacceptable. But remember, this is an inexpensive hotel, don't expect great luxury.

However, the hot water seemed to run out by the late afternoon (although when I spoke to the reception, they said they would send someone up. no one came but the water got hot. Same happened next day - do they have a tank which they turn on when someone complains???) On our second day our room was not serviced. We had been out since 8.30 am and this was 6.30 pm. The desk was not very pleasant about it - almost implied that it was my fault somehow - but I stood firm and they cleaned it before we came back at 10.30 pm. It was however unusual for the staff to be so unfriendly. BUT the worst thing was the school parties - felt like every teenager in the UK was visiting during half term week The noise on the first night was unbelievable. The desk said they had 800 staying!! Because of this I would not stay during holiday periods again - it settled down after the first night, but was still noisy at times. The hotel couldn't be better situated however and feels safe.

Not one of the nicest hotels in NYC, but a pretty decent package for the price. I would recommend this as a good choice for a short trip / long weekend where location, convenience and price are the priorities.

One plus, is the convenience of driving up to the door, and having the car taken to safety without being concerned about where to park in the city. They charge $32 per day for the parking. Well worth it, I think. The room on the 22nd floor was actually considered a suite, with one room having 2 twin beds, the other a king size bed. Bathroom old fashioned deco with original fixtures, was small, but that's how they made them in those days. Convenient Deli attached to the lobby, was great for breakfast, and the many restaurants within short walking distance makes this a fine place to start your vacation. The subway stop is a block away, and Rockefeller Center just about 3 blocks east. We were close to Times Square for the New Years Eve celebration, by using our hotel key envelopes to show the Police at 47th Street. Once near the pens they set up, we tipped a doorman at the Marriott Marquee, who ushered us past the guards and into the crowd.

We arrived at the hotel after a nice relaxing Limo ride from the airport. It was close to the cost of a taxi so we thought what the heck we are on vacation!!! We were able to check in right away even tho it was only noon. The first room we were given had a window that would not close all the way. Being December we wanted a window that closed compleatly so we went back down to the front desk. They said they would send a maintenace man up to fix the window. Within 5 minutes we had a repair man in our room. He decided he was unable to fix the window. We headed back down to the desk and we were immediately given a room on the 8th floor- no problem. The rooms were small but clean and that is all we were concerned about. We had a room with a queen size bed and a couch. The bathroom was small. The only problem we had with the bathroom was we had a non working hairdryer. We didnt call to get a new one because it wasnt a big concern of ours We ate breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel one morning which had VERY resonable prices.We did try to go to breakfast at a restraunt in Times Square but the omelettes were 18 dollars each so we opted for Starbucks instead. There is a small deli type store we found on our last night. We heard they had good sandwiches, fruit, etc at good prices.

Not everyone will go out of their way to make eye contact or strike up a conversation. But no one was rude and everyone we had to deal with directly was polite and friendly. Our room had two queen size beds, a lounge chair, a writing desk and television. Small but more than adequate even having spent some down time in our room midday. High speed internet is available for a fee. The connection was good, the speed was better than I anticipated and the cost was in par with what I would expect in the industry.

Clothing and such (to dress after a shower) needed to be placed on the closed toilet lid or on/in the sink. Not ideal but we managed. Despite what I read about slow elevators we did not have that problem. There are six cars and we never had to wait more than a minute, even at busy times when the first might be full another would be along quickly. There was 24 hour security guard near the elevators... in the morning security seemed lax, but in the evening without exception room key-cards needed to be shown to get by. We didn't eat in the on site restaurants. For morning coffee and quick meals we used the 24hour deli two doors down. It was fantastic, prices were reasonable and the food was good.

The Hotel is central for everywhere and in a great spot. If you have already booked this hotel don't worry too much, the hotel was only for sleeping in at the end of the day. A little tip, go to Macy's for all your bargains, they have a sale on, upto 50% off most items, also go to the visitors centre on the first floor, take your passport and they will give you a card which entitles you to a further 11% off most items, fantastic if you like shopping.

Some rooms were not cleaned for new guests arriving etc. We eventually got our room having been checked in by a helpful member of staff. The room was not recently decorated and seemed dark and dull. The bathroom was tiny. The room was clean but really could do with being redecorated. The biggest plus with this hotel is the location. It is just off TImes Sq in the heart of New York. There is a cafe in the Hotel that serves breakfast and the service is very fast and efficient. It is also quite good value. The Hotel also has a bar that has a great atmosphere. The bar man, Jose pours a great G&T. On Times Sq there is a great Italian restaurant called The Olive Garden. Well worth a vist. Great Food. Just a few minutes walk from the hotel on the corner of 48th & 8th there is a really good bar called The Social. Fantastic atmosphere and some of the best bar food around. Try the Buffalo wings, onion rings and fries. Also there burgers are great. We went to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular and it was fantastic.

The room itself had a sofa couch but I didn't need it. The washroom was very small. The room was clean and spacious. The main problem with the room, in my opinion, was the extremely cheap shower curtain they put in the shower/tub. I could have gotten a better one at the dollar store. This thing was barely long enough for the tub and when you turned the shower on, all it wanted to do was cling to your skin. Ugh... The shower head was also a little loose and water spurted in all directions. All the staff I encountered were very nice and polite.

Our room - always on the small side - had become very shabby. The air conditioner (a box under the window) barely worked and smelt very musty (unlike last time when it worked fine). The windows were dirty, the curtains were torn and everything in the room looked very well used - including small holes in the sheets. It's a real shame as new bedding a good clean and a paint would have this place back to its former good state. I actually bought a friend here and felt embarrassed by the state of the place and the fact I had previously told her it was so great. The reception area still looks OK but the halls are quite poor now, especially the entry near Sophia's restaurant which appears to be being used as a semi-storage corridor for all manner of odds and ends including a desk, broken phone and some old carpet that were there the entire 2 weeks we were in the city. I was also concerned about the security in the lobby area as there seemed to be quite a few odd people 'hanging about' that were not there last time I stayed. I used the public phone booth near the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk one afternoon and was concerned about someone potentially pick pocketing things from my handbag. In years passed unless they were guests these guys would have been moved on. All in all the location is still fabulous, the staff are still wonderful but the hotel itself really needs some repairs.

We have two boys aged 13 and 11. We stayed at the Edison Hotel, near Broadway/Times Square -an excellent location. I loved it as there are many original art deco features, although it is a little shabby in places. Four in one room was stressful at times, with nowhere to let off steam and the problem of varying sleep hours. The hotel's facility of renting movies helped ease some of the stress. We arrived early evening - late to us with the five hour delay - and found everything a bit hectic at first. It wasn't helped by the 11 year old crashing out and being fully alert by 4 the next morning. However, we came to enjoy walking down Broadway and looking at the shops and sights - Toys R Us has a great ferris wheel that the 11 year old liked but 13 year old not impressed by. We are not used to the Americam system of 'room only' and it was difficult to find somewhere for each meal that suited everyone. There is a cafe joined to the hotel, that seemed OK, and a great deli next door. But for us parents, who wanted more than cardboard plates and plastic cutlery, we did not manage to find anywhere mid-market, with decent food that included options our fussy children would consider. Activity-wise, we did a tour on the first day that took in most of the major sites and the Staten Island ferry - this was a great success with a personable guide. Second day was up the Rock for fantastic views over the city - all enjoyed and recommended. We also did Central Park, which was good as it was a fabulous day but boys surprisingly bored by it. Third day was a Circle Line cruise around Manhattan - again boys not impressed, weather had changed for the worse and we had a feeling that three days would have been enough! However, fourth day we took the subway and walked over Brooklyn Bridge, which everyone enjoyed, and spent time at South St Seaport pier and museum - again something for everyone here.

This room was tiny (and from talking to others was the normal size) you could barely fit a suitcase either size of bed which was supposed to be a double but was a lot smaller, in the bathroom the sink was cracked and there was mould growing in the cracks, we were both devastated this hotel was a joke, we couldnt stay there it was just a tacky joke, we decided to find a new hotel in the morning we were so upset we walked the streets of new york to about 6am then my wife had to lye down. Anyway we got a great hotel just behind the edison (the Marriott marquis -a lot more expensive but worth every penny), after a day or two my wife noticed a lump on the back of her leg and it kept getting larger eventually we had to go and see a doctor- it was a bed bite or so the doctor thought and it obviously came from the edison (from talking to people around times square it did not have a good reputation for hygeine). So to end this review- Dont even think of staying there you will regret it, it smells, is tacky and everything said on its website couldnt be further from the truth.

Oh and the AC made more noise than a Brass Band.....just a place to lay...etc., Jet lag hadnt quite kicked in but the thought of being back in NYC and so close to Times Square, wash a rush....so we unpacked and went of to get reacquainted. We managed to burn up several hours more before we returned to the room for some sleep......ahhhh...just a place to lay your head...... Quite a comfy bed...got the extra pillows (a must on arrival ask for them) ...a warm humid evening/night, during which I thought I felt something land on my neck....oh dear.......and then suddenly my wife screamed.....COCKROACH!!!!!....ugh...(pictures available on request). Not a great moment...it was BIG RED and very UGLY.....having \"stunned\" it I realized it may not be alone...and what was that that had landed on my neck?

Staff and amenities were great, the Edison Cafe (attached to the hotel) has a more traditional style......its Pure New York....staff work their butts off...food is plentiful and cooked however you prefer. There is also a Deli/Cafe a few steps from Edison -New Diamond CAFE - a good standard option within easy reach....handy for a coffee to take up to your room whilst you get ready for the next round of holidaying. Location is another obvious plus....out of the Main Entrance doors turn right...walk for 2 minutes..and you are there, right in the Heart of Times Square. All usual \"must do\" tourist attractions are within an easy walking distance, for those that are able, if not there is plenty of public transport and the hotel has its transport desk that can always help you make any special arrangements. Another handy tip: Go to the Time Warner building, just off the Columbus Circle, adjacent to Central Park...go into the basement and feast yourself on the wonderful array of foods which are available...salad bar/deli set up is heaven....pick whatever you like from a vast range of tastes and styles...go and get it weighed in at one of the forty odd checkouts and pop over the road to Central Park for a picnic...so romantic Finally (if you have managed to read this far...HIYA!!!)..we WOULD stay at the Edison again even with the night visitor event in our minds...we felt secure and looked after in there, the location is excellent and at reasonable rate (safety deposit box access from the front desk.....which is NO charge) all seemed to be run very efficiently.

Is really nice to go walking in the area enjoying Times Square in the night. Walking distance to Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Theater District, 5th Avenue, Madison Square garden and to subway stations. 2. Parking- The valet parking was 32$ the night. Not bad and the people in charge of the service are great. 3. Very comfortable bed (but bring your own pillows) 4. EDISON cafe- great breakfast Cons: 1. Appearance- The hallways are just UGLY. The building looks very old and kind of hospital-like. 2. The bathroom shower had 4 faucets instead of 2 and the bathroom flushed the same way as public bathrooms. Was funny looking. 3. Didn't like the towels at all. 4. The curtains didn't provide much privacy from the outside. If there's nothing better for my money I would stay there again knowing is not perfect at all.

I booked it because of its proximity to the place where I was working during the week. I had stayed at the Pennsylvania Hotel nearer Macy's last time I had come to New York for business and had been a bit disappointed with it, as the decor was old-fashioned, the rooms looked a bit run down and the lobby was always crowded, so this time I decided to try the Edison, as it looked more modern and advertised a nice bar in the lobby, which I thought would be a nice place to go after a long day at work. However, it was almost identical to the Pennsylvania - very old-fashioned, unmatching decor in the rooms and a crowded lobby, so I guess this is typical for this part of New York at the 3-star price range. The rooms were cleaned daily, but on the evening I arrived I found rubbish in the bathroom bin and a used towel hanging from the shelf, although the bed was made, so I got the feeling someone had used the room after the maid had cleaned it, which didn't give me a good opening impression. For the rest of my stay, though, the room was cleaned daily and the towels were changed daily. The shower in the bathroom was a bit hit and miss - the water was either freezing cold or scalding hot and gave no warning when the temperature was going to change! The bathroom was quite small and there was nowhere to hang a handtowel, except from the shelf over the basin. I tried to watch the TV in the room on my first night there and couldn't get the remote control to change channels. I reported it the next morning and when I came back to the room that evening the TV had been left on (I assume to show me it had been fixed). The room itself was a decent size for one person - there was an armchair and a desk, as well as a double bed. There was also a telephone and an alarm clock in the room and a hairdryer in the bathroom. The worse thing about the room was the noise from the street - it's near Times Square after all! Sounds of traffic, horns, sirens, thumping music, etc go throughout the night, but if you close the window and switch on the air conditioning it drowns out the worst of the noise. The bar, which sounded really nice on the website, was a tiny pub-like area with some mediocre entertainment - it was always crowded, so I had to go outside the hotel to get a drink. As the hotel is in a tourist area there are lots of places to get something to eat, but they are mainly chain restaurants and burger bars and I always went over to 9th Avenue for a meal, as there are lots of independent restaurants there where the locals go. The hotel also has a restaurant and diner attached to it - I didn't eat here, as I found a more authentic one on 9th Avenue that I went to everyday (The Westway Diner) - huge portions, reasonable prices. Despite the number of people staying in the hotel, I didn't have to wait too long to check in or check out. The lobby just beyond the reception desk has a seating area and is a nice place to sit if you are meeting someone. It is beautifully decorated in art deco style, but it does get very crowded. There are several lifts, so I never had to wait long to get into one, but I was a bit concerned about security, as, although there was a notice telling you to show your room key to a security guard who sat near the lifts, I rarely saw a guard there and even when there was one, he never asked to see my card. The corridors are very long and when there is no one else about, it can be a bit creepy walking back to your room from the lift. The worst thing, from a business point of view, is that there is no business area with computers where you can access the internet. I think you can access the internet in your room if you have a lap top, but I didn't have a lap top with me and would have found an internet room really useful.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cWill never stay here again\u201d", "Author": "ALloyd", "ReviewID": "UR8209661", "Content": "I have stayed in quite a few hotels, but this has been the worse by far.

They were right. It is right in Times square so be prepared for staying in the horn tooting, siren screaming capital of the world. It is singularly the noisiest place I have ever stayed. Aside from that it is a hotel designed in the Art Deco period. Unfortunately they have done nothing to it since. Our room was not cleaned very thoroughly (hairs and rubbish all over the bathroom floor) The bed linen looked like it had been slept in (and not by us!) The room had a very unpleasant odour. The bath taps ran continuosly and no one was interested in repairing them. The rooms were tired and run down. The hotel staff were surly and very uninterested in providing any level of decent service. The hot and colds taps in the shower ran like a symphony orchestra - hot one second and cold the next. The best I can say about this hotel is it's location in Times square. They have a cafe attached which is cheap for breakfast, or so it seems until they start adding on the taxes and compulsory \"gratuities\" (which runs between 15-20%) In fact all they do is double the tax. We noted a lot of places in New York add a complusory tip into your bill and then expect you to tip on top of that. So they are double dipping a lot of the time. The subway is the quickest transportation on Manhattan Island. Although not as good as the London tubes they are reasonably quick and have lots of destinations. A single ride is $2 per person and you can purchase a 'Metrocard' in 4,10,20 etc denominations. You can use one card for two or more people (you just hand it over to them and they swipe it through again). You can't do that with the 'Oyster' card in London. Unfortunately it is difficult to find any maps of the various different lines in the tube stations themselves so try and get a map from one of the tourist centres. Otherwise you may find it a little frustrating trying to work out where you should be. By water the cheapest and most efficient travel was via Water Taxi and using their \"hop-on-hop-off\" system. It goes quite close to the Statue of Liberty so you can get some decent photos. However it does not stop on the Island like some tour boats do. Electronics are very reasonable for Kiwis to buy. Expect to barter HARD and make sure you know what the price of the same item is at home. We found that on average you could buy the product for 1/3 of the ticketed price. Our best dinner was in Greenwich Village/Soho. The people and the restaurants are very eclectic and although very busy - nothing like Times Square.

Then the card lock on our door broke and we were unable to get into our room. This was about 1am after a night on the town. We called the concierge and they made us wait 20 minutes outside our room for someone to come and fix the door. The concierge tried to get in for at least 10 minutes before admitting the lock was broken (which we already knew - cheers). So then we had to wait for a kind of locksmith to come and completely refit the door lock, which took another half hour. Again, they made no attempt to move us to another room.

For the price paid, this hotel is definitely a steal. They could even stand to raise prices a litte (in their own interest, not travelers!) and I think people would continue to book there. Let's face it... It doesn't have a pool, etc., but who the heck goes to NYC to swim?! This is definitely a budget hotel, but if you're anything like me, you just need a place to keep your luggage and to sleep. So if it's clean and safe, then it's good. And that's exactly what the Edison Hotel does. Staff was excellent... went out of their way to help when they could. The lobby is an excellent place to just chill out... and the 24-hour deli next door is a lifesaver! Fresh, yummy muffins and French Toast, as well as a grill with hamburgers, etc. and a salad bar. But the best part of the hotel is the location. Why stay somewhere 10-15 miles away and commute each day to the city when you can stay 1/2 block away from Times Square? I went to quite a few theaters to see Broadway shows, and in fancy shoes I was still able to walk to every single one of them without my feet aching. Now that's location! And with a subway stop just down the street, the further away tourist sights are just a short walk away, as well. I'm hoping I get the opportunity to travel back to NYC, and when I do you can bet I'll be rebooking with the Edison.

I realized that it is a tough time to get a room in NYC. So, I remembered the Edison - I called the property directly spoke to a delighful reservationist who informed me that they did have a room for me and the rate was $165.00 plus taxes. I reserved the room immediately. By the way several dotcoms had the the same room for $399.00 - sometimes its wise to call the property yourself. You could save yourself a lot of money, in addition the dot.coms want payment in full at the time you book - when you book with the hotel they hold the room for you with your credit card and you don't pay until you check out. Remember with any hotel, if you pre-pay with a dotcom they already have your money and any complaint you may have, may not be treated the same as it would if your reservation was booked with the hotel directly. I walked into the hotel lobby at 11am, checked in and went directly to my room on the 6th floor. Our room was fine - two queen beds, TV etc. Ok the bathroom is small, but I'm not planning on doing any ballroom dancing in a bathroom. There was plenty of room to do bathroom things. The room was clean, well heated and adequately appointed. As others have said, if you go to New York to sit in a hotel room, there's something wrong. Again, as in other reviews I have written, let's keep it in perspective (I can't believe the review where the Edison was compared to The Bellagio in Las Vegas - how ludicrous!) Keep in mind the Edison is a very high traffic hotel and there is a lot a wear and tear - they just do not renovate as much as the others. In the hotels that charge $400-600 a night ,they do so because they are constantly replacing and doing the cosmetic makeovers to keep people from whining. This costs money and it is reflected in your room rate. I'd much rather pay less have a decor a few years old and still have the cleanliness - this is what you get at the Edison. And yes, The Edison is very conveniently located in Midtown Manhatten with access on 46th and 47th Streets - just a few shorts steps will put you in Times Square or on Restaurant Row or at your favorite theater. Walk in any direction from the hotel and you will find an unlimited number of places to eat. The staff was friendly, courteous and attentive.

The hotel is very big and they have a lot of staff especially in the Reception department, so, even if they are all corteous, they are not overly friendly but only because they have so many people to attend to. When we arrived, after checking in, they had a porter bring all of our luggage to our room. It wasn't ready yet (it was only 11 a.m) but they let us leave our luggage there and we could get changed after 4 hours on the train from Boston. The room itself was very clean when we came back that evening and all of the other days (which is a very good thing because in NYC many hotels are never too clean!). It was quite big for NYC standards, with two big queen beds, a big TV, a small round table and two little armchairs, a dresser and a big mirror all over the wall (quite nice for the ladies to check out their outfits!). It was obviously quite noisy from the street below, but again, this is NYC, and, honestly, after a day walking around the Big Apple, we were so tired we didn't really notice!

We paid extra of course, but it was really cheap and breakfast was quite good! The cafe room is also nicely decorated, reminded us of hotels we see on old American movies. The greatest advantage of all is, of course, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location.

I came to New York in May with my wife for 6 nights. We booked this months in advance and specifically asked for a quiet room on a high floor as we appreciate that New York is not exactly quiet. On arrival the foyer seemed quite nice but the receptionist didn't seem to have any notes of our requests (including a room upgrade as it was our anniversary). We asked for a high floor and were taken to a room on a high lever but it was opposite the lifts so obviously wouldn't be quiet. We were offered a room on the 8th floor which we pointed out was fairly low so were then taken to a room which I think was on the 23rd floor which was literally the very farthest room from the lift which we thought would be ok. By this time were tired & hungy so dumped our cases into what looked like a small room and went for a bite to eat. It was only when we came back and had a look around that we saw what a disgusting, filthy room we had been put in! The room was very very small, the carpets were soiled & stained and the bedding was like something out of Porridge (a UK sitcom based in a prison!). To top it all off there was an enourmous metal heating pipe running up the side of the building which was right outside of our window and gave a constant humming noise. We decided to stay there that night as it was late and look elsewhere in the morning. I slept on the sheets as I didn't even want to get in the bed and spent the night itching from I hate to think what.

We bought two ice trays at a local store and had more than enough ice throughout the stay, as well as loads of room for restaurant leftovers. They claimed the room had been renovated, but the furniture was pretty shabby and the carpet needed to be replaced. However, the room seemed clean enough and the service was more than adequate. The bed was comfortable, although not a full length king. The bath was small, but had a full tub with good water pressure. The AC was fine, until it began to get really hot our last day; we were comfortable, but I doubt it woud keep up in a prolonged heat wave. The location can't be beat.

Before heading there, I read reviews of the Edison Hotel here on TripAdvisor. I had already booked my hotel (without having first checked TripAdvisor), so the negative comments here had me a bit scared that I was going to end up in a 'dump'. Of course, I was only in one room (a single for $170/night), and can't comment on all of their rooms, but I have to say it was perfectly clean, didn't seem \"old\" or \"musty\". I wouldn't say it's the greatest hotel I've ever been in, but I didn't expect more than an average hotel for the price (keeping in mind that this is NYC, the $170/night price isn't top-of-the-line). I saw at least one review where the people complained about the maid service bothering them on check-out day (check-out time is 1pm, but the maid kept bothering them starting at 10am). I was there two nights, and was out LATE each night. I put the \"Do not disturb\" sign there both nights. The first morning, I actually didn't leave the room until about 2pm. The second morning, I was checking out, and left the room at about 1pm. I heard NO knocks on the door either morning - the maid staff actually *paid attention* to the \"do not disturb\" sign - something very rare, IMO.

I don't know about you but when I came to NY on holiday I wanted to get a real sense of the place and the Edison helps to do that: what you see is what you get, just like the whole City. I highly recommend both the bar (think its called the Rum House - great atmosphere and perfect for a pit stop either pres or apres your evening's activities) and also the deli/coffee shop attached to the hotel. The food is GREAT and the service is again very New York-y. (For any Sx & The City Fans this is where Carrie went after she got rained on outside the Guggenheim and then went for some soup - she was sat at the coffee shop bar and got talking to some loony old lady who put lithium on her ice cream). True, there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms (like all other Brits this is a big deal) but I've never seen these in any American hotel! Also you can nip downstairs to the coffee shop anytime for a hot drink and there are delis on either end of the street open 24 hours. Sometimes its more cool to stay in an atmospheric place rather than a sanitized, bland upscale hotel - the Edison is \"a true NY experience\".

What lets this hotel down is the rooms. We stayed in room 2117 on the 21st floor. The room is tiny! It looks as if it has been cut in half. There's barely enough space to walk between the bottom of the bed and the tv stand. When our eyes had adjusted to the cramped size we noticed how grubby the room was. The skirting boards were black with filth and the carpet was no better. To be fair the bathroom wasn't too bad. If like us you won't spend any time in the hotel other than showering and sleeping its ok. We were disapointed that there are no tea and coffee making facilities, but in all honestly there probably isn't room for them. Take your own hairdryer if you need one, my girlfriend bought a cheap one because she assumed they would have one.

The carpet is old and dirty and did not touch my bare feet for the entire stay. It looks as if the carpet is only vacuumed semi-regularly. A quick survey of the room will uncover a lot of dust bunnies, mold and grime; especially where the wall meets the floor. The double bed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mattress was lumpy, but acceptable. The linen was clean and changed every day. It just looked like the room needed and really good scrub. Bring earplugs that you can wear while sleeping, NY is a city that goes all night. The bathroom was very small, but that is what I expected. The bathtub was not used for a bath due to the mold in the tub around the drain. The facet water was very drinkable. The hotel staff were courteous. The only time I needed to call for assistance was when more towels were needed and housekeeping delivered them promptly. The location of the hotel is its best feature. The hotel is seconds from Broadway, Times Square and the subway. Breakfast at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 downstairs is a must.

Everyone in the city, with the exception of the NYC Information Booth lady at Grand Central Terminal, was tremendous. All of our silly tourist questions were answered politely and correctly. TIP: Ask someone walking a pet for directions; they almost always know the area. As I am from a popular tourist town, I was able to identify and avoid most of the tourist centric crap that can derail a trip.

We could hear police action & a fight going on down on the street. The consierge & desk staff were not very pleasant & very impatient when asked for directions. The room temperature was hard to control on the ancient heat/AC register & went from to cold to too hot & made lots of noise whenever the heat came on.

We were on the 3rd floor in a double room and honestly, it was absolutely fine. More than big enough, lovely clean bedding, comfortable bed and pillows. Big t.v., table, chair etc. The bathroom was smallish but no smaller than mine at home so I wasn't bothered in the slighest. Important thing is that it was spotlessly clean.

On our arrival, the guy who attended to us was really friendly as were all the staff during our stay. We had breakfast in the Edison Cafe all of the time we stayed and it was great. Ok, could do with a lick of paint but the place was clean and the food well cooked and tasty. Again, the staff were nice. We spent one evening in the Rum House and that was lovely and relaxing. There was a lady playing piano and singing. The guy at the bar was excellent - very attentive and pleasant. Being there on the run up to Christmas, the bar was decorated beautifully and it reminded me a bit of Santa's Grotto - lovely! They have an excellent gift shop where the staff were friendly and helpful. The goods on sale were very fairly priced in comparison to shops outside. Negative comments?

For the most part, the pictures of the rooms were accurate, however the bathrooms are quite small and the showers/bathtubs are a little old. Bring your own hairdryer as there are none supplied in the rooms, and if you need an iron, housekeeping will bring one by for use only for an hour. I would also recommend that if you are acustomed to using the hotel products (such as shampoo and conditioner), that you bring your own bottles. The products supplied by the hotel are small sachets and wouldn't last if you are in a group of more than two. There are no self serve ice machines or pop machines in the hotel either. We ordered ice one night and had it brought up to our room by a bellboy. We did have a bit of a problem the last night we were staying at the hotel. We had initially opened up the window in our room the first day we arrived, (which was quite easy, and it was quite obvious that the windows had been replaced since the 20's) and when we did that, the window pane came out of the track, falling towards us. Luckily we caught the window and slid it back into the track. We had informed the front desk of the issue with the window and they said they would take care of it. Our last night in the room, we came back to the suite and when we opened up the door, the window fell right out of the track, hitting the AC vent, smashing glass all over the floor, and in my suitcase which was unfortunately positioned underneath it. We had immediate service from the maintenance in the hotel and were moved to another room immediately- which was great service, but we would have rather waited, as the window was replaced before we had re-packed our suitcases and the floor merely needed vacumming. The one great thing about this hotel is the location. Times Square is located less than a city block away and there is a great strip of pubs/lounges the other block away. We walked to many of the tourist destinations and there are great restaurants located nearby. An atm is also located at the convenience store next to the hotel and there is a small gift shop within the hotel itself that has a few drinks, t-shirts, key chains etc. For my first trip to NYC, staying at the Hotel Edison was part of the experience.

Eating is interesting as the portions are generally huge in the touristy eateries so we opted to share which worked better.

Did find it a bit of an inconvenience that there was no hair-dryer available, and British guests may want to note that there's no kettle provided in the room. The bellhops were very friendly and helpful, but the reception desk staff were definitely not. Hence us not asking to be moved to a different room when the night-club was blasting out - didn't want to have to deal with the receptionist again. Overall, I'd recommend for the location, but be prepared for basic facilities and make sure you're high up to avoid the noise.", "Date": "April 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cEdison was fine\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3353198", "Content": "My girlfirend and I have just returned from a stay in the USA, we had 5 days in Boston, followed by 4 days / nights in NYC at the Edison.

This is a minor negative, considering that this hotel is 2 minute's walk from Times Square, the cost of the hotel room is good value and you don't go to NY to look out of your bedroom window! You can eat in the cafe of the hotel, but there are so many deli's that it's best to take a wander and try a few out. I would recomend anyone to go to Carve', a sandwich / salad shop that is a minute's walk from the Edison - walk out of the front doors and turn left down 47th street and it's on the corner.

We were 4 persons: my husband and I and two sons of 19 and 13. All of us were very pleased with this hotel: it was clean, the staff was very kind and we heared very little of the noise outside. The rooms are quite sound-proof!(We couldn't even say if we had neighbours or not! and I sleep very lightly!! Even the elevators go smoothly up and down without rattling.) I must say I was a little bit afraid to go to the Edison, after having read all the reviews of the past months, but I've been there now and I can assure everyone that this hotel is above average!! It's true: the bathrooms are really small and should be renewed, and the rooms are as not as spacious as the pictures on the website make you to believe, but who cares! I didn't go to new York to sit in my room or to admire my bathroom every hour of the day. The beds were made every day, the sheets were clean, towels were changed daily and the bins emptied. We didn't have to use the heating or airco, so I cannot say if it works or doesn't work without noise. The Edison caf\u00c3\u00a9 is recommended in a lot of guide books, but this was a big disappointment. The waiters and waitresses were not friendly at all, the food was below average and the restaurant didn't make a clean impression at all. We didn't try out the restaurant in the hotel ( entrance on 46th street). I'd like to finish my review with this statement: When you stay at the Edison hotel, you are in the middle of New York, a step away from a ticket-discount-office for all the broadway productions which are to be seen, only a second away form busstops, next to restaurants, coffeeshops, at ten minutes walk from Rockefeller-center, at twentyfive minutes walk from Macy's and the Empire State building, briefly : you are right in the middle of the Big Apple.. and at a VERY REASONABLE PRICE!

We had one closet and a large chest of drawers, enough room to fit the clothes of 4 girls for a week!!! The bathroom is tiny but how much time do you spend in the bathroom were you're in NYC, what really matter was that it was CLEAN (even if there was a little rust in some of them). No A/C or heating problem. We had a problem with the toilets once but it was taken care of rapidly and efficiently.

With only one outlet available for use, it was difficult to charge phones and cameras, and use hairdryers and curling irons.

We called prior to our check in to confirm our reservation. The first time we were told to call back during \"Reservation hours\" but the second call confirmed our reservations. We checked into the Edison on the 13th. We were met at our cab by a bellhop who unloaded our bags and took them in. We had to wait a bit to check in, but once we were, the bellhop showed up to our room: third floor facing 47th street. The location is amazing. Walking to the corner of Broadway and 47th, you're right in Time Square. Our room was what I thought as large, especially after reading reviews about other hotels in our budget-area. It didn't click until after we got back home, but the room could have been a bit larger because it was a corner room. Everything was super clean. Being on the 47th side, we did hear a lot of noise all night, especially when the building across the street cleaned their sidewalks at 1130pm. But, by the second night, we all slept through the noises. We never heard our neighbors or anything in the hall. Our bathroom was clean. The shower had a continuous drip, but it wasn't bothersome. It took awhile for hot water to come, but I'm guessing it was because of the cold weather. We utilized the bellhops: The second day we asked for help to the subway, and were given great directions. The last night, we asked Joe, one of the bellhops, about a place for dinner. The place he recommended was amazing, as well as college-budget-friendly. Housekeeping was impeccable: After returning for the night on the second day, we realized we were missing a personal belonging. After a call the next morning, housekeeping delivered it back to our room. There were 6 elevators that all worked and were quick. It was hard to get 3 people in a single car during the morning check out, but otherwise, they were great. Check out was quick and friendly. The hotel did offer two pay-for-use computers in the lobby. It was $1 for 5 minutes, which I thought was pretty good. They were fast and reliable. We ate at the deli next door every morning for breakfast. They were reasonable with prices and offered a variety of options, including a fruit/salad bar, a full deli, Mongolian BBQ and hot food. You are able to buy things and go upstairs to a large dining area to eat. Overall, I would stay at the Edison again in a heartbeat.

My girlfriend had stayed there before but i was a little trepidatious having read some of the earlier TripAdvisor reviews. However one should always listen to one's girlfriend! I was very pleasantly surprised. The check in process was smooth and efficient. We had a room on the twelfth floor. One of the most stressful parts of going to a hotel is wondering what the room will be like when the door is first unlocked but we were very pleased. It was a spacious twin bedded room with a large TV that actually worked and had good picture quality, (hey i like watching TV!). The bathroom, decorated in grey tiling was small but clean with a good supply of towels and amenity products. The beds were very comfortable and the sheets clean. There was a large dresser with a good amount of drawer space. The wardrobe was a bit basic but it had a sufficient number of hangers and was fine. Our room overlooked the Barrymore Theatre. During the night there was very little to no noise outside the hotel which for New York is quite an achievement. The air conditioner worked on all the settings and was quiet. Overall for our room I would give it 9 out of 10. Very good indeed. We breakfasted each morning at the Cafe Edison which is just off the hotel lobby. The food was reasonably priced with a good choice of menu. Service was quick and friendly and the food was well cooked. It is obviously a popular breakfast destination for locals too. It has quite a history too, with it's Broadway connections displayed by posters and pictures. One is also dining in good company; there was a recent picture of Chelsea Clinton with the restaurant manager! Overall I would give the Cafe, an 8 out of 10. Before venturing out for the evening we had a drink at the hotel's bar, the Rum House (?). Drinks were very cheap during Happy Hour. The service was brisk and friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. On one of the evenings there was a lady piano player/singer with a very good voice. They also serve cappucino and espresso's for those in need of something warming but non alcoholic! The lobby at the Edison is fantastic Art Deco and very comfortable. The staff in the hotel shop were all very friendly and one of them \"loved our English accents\" which is always great to hear! It is free to open a safety deposit box although there is a $50 fine if you lose the key. I admit I had a few frantic moments searching for my key so beware. It can be easy to mislay. The Edison has a great location. As other reviewers have stated, turn right and you are in Times Square! The Subway is just across the street by the Olive Garden restaurant although it is not well signposted. It is 49th Street on the R Line. It also saves you the walk to 42nd Street/Times Square which is the next stop down the line anyway. Don't forget to buy a one day fun pass Metrocard for $7. Excellent value for money. So, our overall verdict on the hotel is 9 out of ten. Well done the Edison!!! No plaudits alas for SuperShuttle. It took us two and a quarter hours to get to JFK from our hotel, picking people up along the way. We drove past/through Times Square three times!! Nerves were getting frayed by myself and fellow passengers as we risked missing our flights. Next time we would buy a return ticket on the New York Transport Service Shuttle bus which includes return transfer to Grand Central Station from the Edison and then a bus directly to JFK non stop.

Not only was it dirty, but had what looked like aspirins everywhere! The worst is yet to come. My first night I heard some noises in the radiator in the room, despite it not being on. My fears were confirmed when the second day I returned from a busy day to find that a large rodent had invaded my travel bag and ate most of a wrapped protein bar inside the bag. When I told management, they seemed unconcerned but volunteered to move me to another floor. The first room was unsatisfactory so they offered another, informing me that it was a handicapped room. Good luck to a handicapped guest who stays there. There were only two electric outlets so they had strew numerous extension cords all over the floor for the lamps, etc. The handicapped bathroom had a large pipe that extended from the ceiling to floor near the sink that must have been for hot water or the radiator as the I almost burned myself when I tried to turn on the light switch nearby.

The Supper Club on the main floor of the hotel is an absolutely beautiful restaurant with great service and live jazz music. Unfortunately, for the bad part, our water in the bathroom was brown! We were very upset and went straight to front desk to see what they'd do... they said they'd be happy to switch us, but it'd have to be the fourth or fifth floor; they had just as bad water there.

Two nights prior to our arrival, we called to make sure they had our reservation & our requests for a nonsmoking, updated room & were assured this was no problem. Upon arrival, we noticed a not so up-to-date lobby with tattered furniture & a rude check in person. We were taken up to our room by a nice bellman all the while noticing the dirty walls in the corridor & overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke. When he opened the door to our room, it was literally the size of our closet at home, however I was assured this was one of the updated rooms. After looking out at our view of the alleyway, we decided to ask for another room & we were told there was one other room available 7 floors up, so we went to that room - which was the same exact room - 7 floors up - obviously, not acceptable. We took our luggage down to the front desk & I told them we would not be staying there, the female employee then asked me what I was expecting. I told her all that I expected were the rooms they had on the internet, not a closet facing an alleyway...what do you know, they had one of those rooms available. We were given yet another key to head up there - it was similar to one on the internet, however had a 70's bedspread, the smell of too many cigarettes on Friday night & the bathroom was disgusting. I felt I had to take a shower after taking a shower there & in fact did when we left after our way too long, 2 night stay. Take my advice, spend the extra $50 or $100 a night to get what you want - the Renaissance Times Square & Marriott Marquis are great & the W Times Square is next door to this, haven't stayed there yet - but it looks nice.

We were checked in on the 6th floor right next to the elevators which you could hear going up and down the wall. Although this is noise you get use to we were paying a fairly top dollar rate in Australian dollars and that is a noise I dont think you should have to put up with. Then over two nights starting at 11 pm till 1pm jackhammering started outside and yes you can hear this as loud as a bell six floors up . We contacted security but he couldn't hear it from the front of the hotel however this noise was coming from a side street which our room faced. We then asked to be moved and with the hotel full they moved us to the 3rd floor in a different part of the hotel which was no better as from 12pm you could hear thumping from drums and guitar playing and some singing. This noise started again at 7am on Sunday morning so if you need a wake up call rest assured the guitar will provide an adequate one for you! I am unsure whether this noise came from the bar lounge within the hotel or a club near by. You are however within a couple of minutes walking distance from the gray line sightseeing office where you can redeem your internet bookings or make bookings.

This was located in the street to the left as you leave the Edison Lobby then turn right at the traffic lights and walk up a couple of streets you can't miss it! The Cafe Edison is WONDERFUL. You are able to get anything from breakfast cerial to evening baked dinners which they change nightly. The cafe is always really busy from hotel guests and walkins from the street. For 12.95 you get half chicken ,vegetables, potato or chips,soup and your choice of beverage. We stayed in New York two years ago and stayed at the Howard Johnson Plaza a couple of streets down from the Edison and had a great stay.

My friends arrived later in the day and while there was a slight mix-up with the rooms (they gave us 3 rooms instead of 2), the front desk staff were more than helpful and fixed the problem immediately. While the Edison is an older hotel, it was clean and comfortable with everything (a/c, TV, taps etc) in good working order. We were on the 6th floor and didn't find it excessively noisy at all.

Convenience store two doors down for beverages and snacks helped too. Across the street from a theatre. Bathrooms small but full tub. Air conditioning good. No bravo channel on tv. Stayed on 9th floor to avoid early morning street noise. Tiny bit of mildew in bath tub area but not enough to make me stay somewhere else. Be prepared for the crowds in Times Square! ATM in lobby. A gift shop. Payphones in lobby. Lobby has a thing where you can check your home email for $1.00 for 5 minutes. Have to pay 50cents for a bucket of ice. The restaurant will put an automatic 15% gratuity on your check but if you call them on it they will cheerfully take it off. We searched the internet for hours and are glad we stayed here and would stay there again. We had a guaranteed ns reservation and checked in very late and ended up being put in a smoking room but it wasn't bad. Activating phone for local calls takes $50 so we didn't do it but still could get voice mail messages.

It is wonderfully refurbished in Art Deco style, with a splendid lobby and very smart, newly renovated rooms. Ok, the bathroom was a tad small, but it had nicely understated new tiles and was kept very clean. The hotel is located literally 55 steps from the TKTS tent on Times Square.

The person my husband talked with said this would be no problem because we had already paid in full. When we arrived the guy at the front desk was very rude and said that they didn't have anymore rooms. He said the only room available was a suite with a king size bed and a couch bed. He offered to send up a roll away also. I guess for some that would sound good, but we were both newlywed couples and one couple got the king size bed and the other got the couch bed that was a little bigger than a twin bed. The next morning we spoke with the manager and he put us in a newly renovated room with a great view. The room had two queen size beds, which was better than our first night. He also bought our breakfast for us the first morning. Other than the confusion the first night, the hotel was ok. It does have a great location right in Times Square. I would say if you are planning on being out and about during the day and only in the room to sleep at night, this would be a good place.

We booked with the same agency as the NJ hotel one, but since there was no organized trip, we had to make ourselves a package and the agency had suggested this hotel.

It was beautiful! Anyways, the info desk was more than helpfull and everything was much more than a rated 2 star hotel. I think that they are trying to renovate the hotel and make it more worthy, cuz i would rate the hotel 4 stars... seriously! the location is more than perfect with the lovely morning breakfast place near called cafe EuropeAn, and with the club downstairs and the one a few feet down the block! The hotel is literaly 5 to 7 minutes away from the bus terminal & subway entrance, and 1 minute away from time square. i'd be now curious to know how the regular rooms had looked like, but instead of looking for a new hotel each time we'll be going to NYC, we,ll be going to this one for sure!

The pool, while not big, was well maintained, as was the outdoor hot-tub. The breakfast included a wide variety of foods, including my daughter's favorite: make-your-own waffle. The room was not huge--with the sofa opened into a bed, there is not much space left--but it was comfortable. The only problem I encountered happened two nights in a row: the plumbing in the sink started knocking. The only way I discovered to make it stop was to fill the sink with water and then remove the stopper, not exactly a viable option. Because the sink was very close to the bed, I was kept awake.

A generous free hot breakfast is provided on site and while we were there, several evenings of snacks/refreshments available for free, but i don't think they do that every night. We had a queen studio room with sofa bed, which was on a single level (there are some suites with upstairs/downstairs). The desk was spacious, probably the largest i have seen anywhere, but it also doubles as the dining table. It has a shelf above, where you could stash work papers and laptop if you need the table for eating a meal. There is also a complete kitchen and fireplace. My only complaint would be that if you do have someone sleeping in the sofabed, it takes up an awful lot of space when pulled open. Otherwise, there is plenty of room for relaxing on the sofa and watching tv, working at the desk and working in the kitchen, even in this smallest setup. As i said, this place is not a cheap budget place, but compares favorably in price to other places in Las Vegas where you would get a lot less.

I was happy to find this Residence Inn very close to the Strip (very close!), yet much quieter and no hassle of parking (lots of free parking here). When I checked in, the front desk girl was soooo nice! First of all, she upgraded me to a 2 bedroom suite (a bottom floor bedroom and an upper floor bedroom / loft) with 2 complete bathrooms! I loved the room. She also provided me with a ton of information on Las Vegas, including where to go for free parking, etc. (a lot of the casinos want you to come in and offer free parking garages - don't ever pay to park in Vegas!). I appreciated all the information. The grounds are magnificent. You can see by my photographs the manicured grounds. There's a common garden area with benches, and a barbeque grill. There's also a fabulous pool and there was a hot tub right outside my room. The hotel is very big, with several buildings. It is more like an apartment complex than a hotel. The rooms are fully equipped with everything - including fast Internet (it's not wi-fi). I had 2 TVs, a living room, full kitchen, and the 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. It was very clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable - standard excellent Marriott quality. After a night on the Strip, I was glad I picked a hotel away from it. It's noisy and crowded on the Strip and I don't particularly care for all those very high-rise hotels. My choice could not have been more perfect. The breakfast in the morning is the icing on the cake. It was a delicious full breakfast bar in a sunny, large room over by the pool area - couldn't be better. Also, not that I cared, but this hotel is located right next to the convention center. It is also only a few steps away from a little metro-rail public transportation thing - if you choose not to drive around the Strip. As great as this hotel was, the best thing about it was the staff. All fantastic! I reallly enjoyed my stay here. Oh, and the perfect Las Vegas weather didn't hurt! And the price - very reasonable for Vegas. No complaints there. p.s.

My first need was to find a motel/hotel where I could park & unload my car -- as opposed to paying a valet to hide my car in a mega-parking garage. I hit the jackpot. By accident I soon discovered the \"Resident Inn\" sign surrounded by low-rise, condo-like units. The lady at check-in could not have been nicer. She led me to a first floor room facing my car. She also gave me an honest rate -- rather than take advantage of a tired guest. The large suite/room contained a full kitchen and a comfortable couch sitting area. Everything was immaculate! As we were walking back to the desk for paperwork, she urged me to take advantage of the complimentary dinner -- which was about to shut down for the night. The complimentary breakfast was, also, excellent. It included scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, fruits, and many goodies. It was served in a lobby/TV room that reminded me of a cozy Bed & Breakfast. Across the street, you can board the monorail for a good overview of downtown Vegas.

Because of the early flight I arrived at the hotel at 9 am and check-in was fast and easy and I got my room in 2 minutes. The room was in reasonable size with a sitting area and a mini kitchen. Because of the new carpet, the whole room looked very new and clean.

I did not hear neighbors walking above us; we were on the ground floor with one level above us.

From the hotel, turn right and head south down Paradise Rd. Turn right at E Harmon Ave (it's right after Hard Rock Casino). Turn right at Audrie St. Now you are behind Planet Hollywood casino (formerly Aladdin) where there is FREE parking! It's actually their mall parking lot. Very convenient mid-strip parking. We parked here all the time. The monorail is convenient, but when we returned late at night (around 1:30am) to the covention center stop, we found that the place was closed.

I was in town for the SHRM Annual Human Resources Conference and for some SHRM Academy Classes as well as some post conference golf. The SHRM Conference which attracted over 22,000 attendees was across the street (six lanes, busy at times) in the LV Convention Center and Hilton next door to LVCC. When there is not much traffic - early morning and some evenings, you can just walk across the street otherwise you have to go the lights. Which can be a bit unpleasant during a hot, hot day. The weather was quite hot (102-106) I took Greyline Shuttle Bus from the airport to the Residence Inn. It cost about $7.00. The ResidenceInn is away from the Strip on Paradise road and across from the L.V. Convention Center. Which makes it convenient for those attending the convention but it is far from the Strip. I walked to the strip from the Residence Inn but it was during the morning and in the evening. It is a long walk, 15 minutes plus and it is much tougher when it is hot. I also walked to Riviera Hotel one evening for a show. The Monorail is a better way to get to the strip and I purchased online a 10 ride ticket. The Monorail goes from the Sahara to the MGM Grand and makes around 7 stops on the East side of the Strip. Getting to the Monorail from the Hotels can be a bit tricky. On Convention Center Road and Las Vegas Blvd., there is a Walgreens, where I picked up beverages, snacks and some medicine, because I caught a minor cold during my stay. It is a long walk when carrying bags in the heat. Next door to Residence Inn is a Courtyard and you can use the Courtyard Gym because this property does not have Gym. Down the street is the Rennisance Hotel. My SHRM Academy classes were at Venetian and there were shuttle buses from the convention center to the Venetian compliments of Kronos. I choose this Residence Inn because of the proximity to the Convention Center, the Monorail and because there was a refridgerator in the room (which comes in handy when the weather is hot). Using my AAA card, I booked some advanced reservations online and I paid several during rates during my stay between $129.00 and $169.00. I checked in Friday, around 12:00 noon, and the friendly front desk person from Wisconsin was able to check me into a \"quiet\" room upstairs near the back of the property. The room was a bit old but clean. Featured a queen size bed and sofa bed. This Residence Inn offers a better than average breakfast in the morning (alternates between bacon, sausage, corn beef hash, pancakes, andeggs, potatoes, donuts, pastries, breads, make your own waffles, fruits and beverages), as well light snack (Meatloaf, mash potatoes, salad and Chicken Cesar Salad and cookies and beer) around dinner time from Monday thru Thursday. For complimentary meals they both were fine. Complimentary Web access in the Gatehouse as well as Wall Street Journal and local newspaper. This Residence Inn is a bit older and reminds me of the Cal Expo Residence Inn in Sacramento. My bed was of average comfort and the room was cleaned each day by Maria. The A.C. worked well but was a bit noisy and behind my wall must have been a loft room because I could hear some creaking at times during the night. Also there were some young Volleyball competitors in the units nearby and sometimes they stayed up late and you could hear them chatting outside. My front door required a particular pull the handle as you insert the card key to open. I reported this and a problem bedside light to \"Sang,\" at the front desk. Nothing was done about it so I mentioned the light to another Marriott employee and it was fixed when returned from my conference. So service is not a priority at this property. There is small sport court and small pool at this property. Plenty of parking spots and you need your room key to open a gate into the parking lot. Driving in and out of this property is not real smooth because you can only go South on Paradise Road when driving out of this property. If I could get a really good rate, I might stay at this property again but I would also consider the Renissance Hotel as well as Residence Inn in the Hughes Center, though the Monorail is not accessible from the R.I. in the Hughes Center. Service at this property was less than the Beverly Hills R.I. and Manhattan R.I. If you looking for a property close to the convention center and close to the Monorail with a kitchen facility then this property might be your place.

There was a regular queen bed in one room and a murphy style bed in the other. I slept on the murphy bed and found it surprisingly comfortable. The pool was warm - not huge, but nice with lots of clean towels (the pool towels were softer than the room towels). The hot tub was great - loved the jets for our tired feet. A full breakfast is included with the room rate - eggs, toast, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, muffins, etc etc etc. The front desk staff was not great - this was the only bad thing about it. They forgot our wakeup call one morning and the alarm clock did not work. They were slow to check us in, and did not tell us we had a package waiting for us. There was a coin laundry - $1 for washer or dryer. The cab ride to the airport was just over $10, not including tip - which is better than the airporter if you have more than one person (airporter is $6 and the driver took us to 2 other Marriotts before the correct one - even though we clearly told him which Marriott it was and we were the only ones on the bus). The monorail is a great way to get to the strip - it takes you to many of the major hotels & casinos. There was room to park our 12 foot trailer and our jeep right close to our room. We had an upper story (they call it a penthouse) room and had to carry our bags up 2 flights of stairs - no elevator.

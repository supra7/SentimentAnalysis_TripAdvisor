I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels an was pleased with the generous government employee rate my husband received. The staff at the Monaco was excellent and always willing to help -- whether it was a change of room because we were initially booked directly in front of the business center or with various recommendations for breakfast or with the fastest directions. We aren't big drinkers, but we loved the evening wine reception the hotel offers. As a Kimpton Insider, I was given a $10 minibar allowance, a perk I think is quite generous. The rooms were well appointed and the bathrooms sparkling and filled with lovely toiletries. We aren't hotel snobs but have stayed at such four-star hotels as the Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton, the Connaught in London, etc., and we thought the Kimpton staff was wonderful!", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leiden, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel in the centre of San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "letsgo053", "ReviewID": "UR126966128", "Content": "The Monaco is a very good hotel in the centre of San Francisco, close to Union Square.

Feels more like a welcoming base than most hotels, though for a price and with that veneer of charged friendliness you may or may not be up for after a full day of meetings. It's like they know they have a good thing and expect you to be more impressed than you are. Echo the comments on nice free wine reception, overworked masseuse (please tip folks, esp Europeans!), superb beds and great location. Rooms are very small, yes, but this never puts me off. Very cosy, well thought-out and retreat-like with canopy beds all pillowed up. Jogging in the morning and turning left instead of right was a proper shock (Tenderloin outskirts) but a few locals ended up running along with me with their liquids and we had a laugh. Basically, it's not as bad as other reviewers suggest, but stay right for upmarketness and general shopping/pop-art/diner mainstream fun. Speaking of, shopping-hungry Brits should head to DSW down the street for the craziest shoe bargains ever. Lovely walk down to the piers, and union square has all you'll need. All in all, a good balanced choice for work and play.

Happy hour with osyter $1 per piece was a great bargain. With free breakfast thrown in for the price, and free internet h if u r a kimpton member, a big yes from me on this hotel. Of course at near $200 a night its abit pricey but will take this anytime over hotel nikko i stayed in few weeks ago. The front desk and conceirge/butler were fabulous service. Downside is the room service that we need to pay a extra charge of $5 for delivering room service (a pizza of $6/- plus 21% tax, $5/- , then personal tips all come to over $43 for a $6 pizza is a bit steep. For the complimentary breakfast, i missed out 3 morning out of 5 of my stayed. The timing cud be more flexible and would be nice if they provide room service for the complimentary breakfast as its only croissant/pastry with coffee and orange juice.. Really hated having to get up just just for that. Will i go back again, yep, if they have a promotion for price to be less steep.. Parking also above $50 a day, cheaper at the corner $30 a day. Location .. good. The bed,,, mmmm i had backache after sleeping on their bed.. which i didnt when i was at hotel nikko. But im not sure cos i been travelling too much or just their mattress. oh and they give complimentary $10 for mini bar. and a free drink for happy hour.

I was very happy with everything from the check in to the check-out. I requested a junior suite off of the street but when we saw the room, were not pleased. The front desk gave us a choice of a couple of other suites, and we chose one on the 6th floor, looking out to the street. I thought we would hear a lot of street noise, but with the exception of a few sirens on St Patrick's Day night (tons of parties in the town), it was quiet. The suite was smaller than the one in the Hotel Monaco in Portland, but was certainly enough room. The bed was comfortable, the dark out curtains allowed for a nice, dark room at night. I liked the pillows provided. Perhaps at one point I put the type of pillow we liked down in a profile, as they were perfect. Good heat/cooling system. The room could be made a perfect temperature. The windows actually open, so if you want fresh air ..it's there. The bathroom vanity was bit small. Limited counter space. Aveda bath products and plenty of complimentary items if you need anything. Just call the front desk. Perhaps we were in a ADA room, but the shower head was on a wand that could be moved up and down in the pipe (can't remember the name of that). Not a problem for me, but my husband is very tall, so he needed to hold the shower wand and could just stand under it. There were rails in the tub, and it was a low tub. Not a worry to us. Plenty of towels and pretty good thick, although I have had better in other hotels. WiFi was excellent. Free if you join the In Touch program. Many hotels in the area charge about $15/day for wifi. We used the fitness room, steam and hot tub. Fitness room was good, but small. Equipment good...two ellipticals, two treadmills, two recumbant bikes and one stair climber. Small collection of free weights, ball, bosu ball and some cords. Lobby always had fresh water, with either cucumbers or oranges. Every night was a wine reception. I thought it might have local wine, but was disappointed to see Little Penguin being served (Australia). Coffee, tea and hot chocolate available in the lobbby in the morning. If you want Starbucks, it's a block down the street. yes, Hotel Monaco is on the edge of the Tenderloin, so don't go left when you leave the building if you don't want to see reality. We took BART from the airport, bused , cable car'd, walked and took one cab while in San Francisco. You do not need a car if you plan to stay in the city, so the parking cost should not be a concern. Recommendations from the front desk for places to eat, were always good. They seem to know the places to go. We did not think the service in the Grand Cafe was efficient and we did not like the food. I would recommend this hotel.

The hotel is very centrally located, near Union Square, lots of restaurants and theaters. It has a special flair, very European and we enjoyed that it also has a restaurant on site. The staff is kind and attentive. The reason I did not give it \"Excellent\" is that there were a few let downs. I had contacted the hotel before the visit three times to stress the importance of a quiet room. I know the hotel is located down town and in a big city, but I had heard that it has rooms back to the courtyard which are very quiet. I am also a Kimpton Intouch member where I also stated that I require a quiet room. My husband is in the Military and it is very important to us as surprising noises, like sirens can stress him. We were given a room on the 7th floor, which is their highest floor, but to the street side. We came well equipped with a white noise maker, and putting the in room fan on, but there was still a lot of outside noise. My husband was ok with it that's why I left it alone. The second night they put a family with a dog in the next room and he barked a few times, but overall it was ok. I just think that if somebody calls and mentions that they need a quiet room and also stresses the reason for military, the hotel should have tried their best to accommodate us. The room was also very small. We had a desk on one side of the bed, but the other side had not even a nightstand. As you are most of the time out and about we did not mind the size, but if I would stay longer then a weekend I think it would be a problem. As a Kimpton Intouch member you get free WiFi, a free Newspaper to your door, $10 discount on the mini bar and $30 of the Spa.

There is also a restaurant at the hotel but I can't say much since we only had a continental breakfast there.

The bathroom was exceptionally large and included a jacuzzi tub. Overall a very nice, very clean room. After check-in we went out to grab lunch and do some shopping. Upon our return we were delighted to find a bottle of wine and a bowl of chocolates compliments of the hotel guest relations manager. A very nice touch.

People Accommodations: - From the moment we checked into the hotel, every time we passed through the front entrance, and even when we checked out, the staff greeted us so genuinely and almost always by name (how they all knew us I'll never know). - The hotel was beautifully decorated for the season and had several lounge areas to hang out and socialize with other guests, who were all very friendly to both us and the dogs. - The room was a good size, spotless and very chic/cute. - The bed was SO comfortable! - We were on the side of the hotel that was off of Geary and we did not hear a sound, except 2 police sirens, and a barking dog for a short while, who was down the hall on the last night. - We ordered room service which was quick, affordable and delicious. Pet Accommodations: - The location of the hotel with our pets was fantastic! - My husband read that the hotel provided dog beds and dog bowls, so we did not bring any, and called the front desk to request some. While it was not a problem to have them brought up to our room, I think bringing their own bowls would have been easier and better for them (even though they were very nice round dog beds and nice brand new metal bowls). - When we arrived the very sweet girl that checked us in (I wish I were as good at remembering names) recommended Boudin Bakery, which was a short walking distance away, and allowed us to eat outside with the dogs (the clam chowder bread bowls were wonderful). - The next two days we drove to Ocean Beach, which was about 20 min away, and is a place that allows dogs to run and play off leash. The beach was clean, went on for miles, and everyone we ran into had dogs playing, and couldn't have been friendlier. There is even a really good restaurant right across the street called Park Chalet, which allows you to eat outside with your pets. - Union Square is the closest place for a grassy potty location, and is only 2 or 3 blocks away, right down the street. It felt like a safe walk there, even at 4:30am. We did pass a few homeless people on the way but they either kept to themselves or just said \"happy holidays\". Note, there is a park on California Street, which is about 7 blocks away, uphill the entire way, and is a major workout. - Note: Our dogs had never stayed in a hotel before, so taking the elevator to the 7th floor was a learning experience.

Westwood set the property standard for me. I stayed at Monaco years ago, and recent negative reviews made me concerned this property had deteriorated. Not so. From arrival to departure, my yorkie and I experienced excellent service (starting with a yummy c-o-o-k-i-e). We stayed here for two weeks due to construction at home. After a sleepless night in a queen room, due to a noisy guest on the other side of a connecting door, I was upgraded to a king suite. The wireless internet worked perfectly. I am an In-Touch member, so no charge for internet (hotels that charge make a mistake). Our top-floor windows faced the street, and there was noise from police/fire sirens during the night, but it was less disturbing than the noisy guest in our prior connecting room! The bed was a bit firm, probably because I don't weigh much so prefer softer mattresses. I like the white duvet covers (and no potentially nasty \"bedspreads\"). The bathroom lighting needs to be improved. It is dim, because of the politically correct dim fluorescent bulbs. One small imperfection-I never did get my newspaper delivery; but if one gets downstairs early enough, the hotel has stacks of three popular papers available. I was comfortable with the bright, eclectic decor. The room was in very good shape, the shower was good. The rooms/suites are smaller than Palomar Westwood (different market). High quality (\"George\") doggy bowls and bed were delivered, and my lil guy was treated like a prince. I forgot to bring his food the first day, and the lovely petite young lady at the front desk, Francis, saved the day by giving him a cache of cookies. The wine-hour opportunity to socialize with other guests around the fireplace is a really nice feature, and it was my dog's favorite time (so many opportunities to show off). Several evenings, samples of the restaurant's flatbreads were served. Every member of the staff offered excellent service. In addition to Francis, Jonathan stands out, but that is not to say that anyone under-performed (I simply don't remember the names). Housekeeping was excellent. The carpeting in the living room looks somewhat worn (probably stained by wine spills), but that room is an inviting place to relax. The very good morning coffee got me out to walk the dog.

Guests would gather on an other room with comfortable seating and have their choice of white or red wine. They were willing to help us in anything we needed, offering to book shows for us, giving us the detailed maps of Chinatown with restaurant suggestions, and so on. The location is great, right in the theater district, about three blocks away from the Central Station (where you can catch the double decker tour buses that take you by every major attraction in the city) and couple more to Chinatown. It is near several cool art galleries for art lovers delight, selling original Mir\u00c3\u00b3, Chagall and Picasso lithographs, even some selling Doctor Seuss' works. It also has a lot of bars and pubs nearby that seem to attract a lot of theater goers before/after plays, besides people that come into the neighborhood for that purpose. For our meals, we could either go to the hotel's French restaurant, in the same beautiful style and ambiance, or find great options nearby. There are a lot of breakfast restaurants, \"diner style\" to choose from nearby, if you prefer not to eat at the hotel. The rooms are good and the toiletries provided for guests were high quality. Notice the funky zebra robes for the guests use hanging in the closets, a nice change from the white ones usually offered at other places, but totally fitting this hotel experience. The hotel also has a gym and spa, but we were too busy exploring the city and had short time there, however if we go back to San Fran we would gladly come back to the same hotel and maybe then check the spa out.

This is a nice hotel, and like all the reviews state, it is in a good central location to all the shopping and theater. The staff is very polite and accommodating. Our valet parking was quick and efficient as was check in and check out. Definitely 5* service. I have stayed at 5* hotels (ie Ritz's, Fairmonts, Four Seasons etc.) where the service has not been this good. If you like older, elaborate, quirky decor, this hotel is for you. The lobby is really pretty, as is the 20's style decor in the attached restaurant. Sadly we missed the wine reception, but we did try the restaurant which was quite good and like the hotel had nice service. As for the homeless people - San Francisco is full of homeless people, but they are harmless. Point is, you are most likely going to get some homeless people around your hotel in SF regardless of where you are staying - ie they hang out around all the 5* hotels too, not just this one. Despite all the great things about this hotel, I will likely not return. This has nothing to do with the hotel, but has to do with the fact that I have bad animal (cat and dog, and anything else with fur) allergies. Like everyone says, this is an extremely pet friendly hotel - as in any sized pet, no size restrictions. There are even pets behind the front desk. I know many hotels in SF are pet friendly, and most allow cats and small dogs, but if you are badly allergic to animals, I would steer clear of this hotel. I think pet owners purposely choose this hotel because it is so pet friendly - ie: there are no size restrictions, they give out doggie treats etc, etc. I am assuming there are a lot more animals in this hotel than there would be at other hotels in SF that have the size restrictions etc. When I booked our stay, I saw the overall positive reviews for this hotel on trip advisor, and just acted too quickly. I didn't read through the hotel's website or the reviews very thoroughly, so I didn't catch the whole pet thing until we'd prepaid and were checking in (my own fault). The staff was accommodating and put us on a pet free floor, but I was still a little bothered - ie woke up a little puffy eyed and congested. Not surprising as there is no way to prevent animal dander and fur from getting into the air and floating around. For me, this hotel was fine for a night, but it wouldn't have been good if we were there for a week. My own fault for not looking at the reviews and hotel website better, so I hope that any one with bad allergies who thinks they might be ok for an extended stay at this hotel reads this review. As a last comment, if you aren't expecting it, you might be surprised at how expensive the hotels and parking are in San Francisco at the end of the summer. ie - our 1 night stay here for a standard room with 2 double beds was well over $400 a night with tax and parking. If possible you may want to travel off season after the flood of European tourists leave the city.

We had not problems and the walk from the Powell St. BART station was quick and easy.

I would have liked there to be a dedicated concierge. The hotel appeared to be a bit understaffed. The bellmen service was outstanding. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows extremely comfortable. The room thermostat sometimes allowed adjustment and sometimes didn't. We dined in the adjoining restaurant the first night and had a very nice dining experience in a lovely ambience. The attached bar is nice. We were very disappointed to learn on a Monday night, after returning from the theater, that the bar closed at 11 pm. We were even more disappointed (and frankly disgusted) when the bar manager yelled across the bar to advise us that last call had been called. I couldn't understand what she said and had to track her down to confirm that the bar was closing. As a guest, I would have appreciated more courteous communication. Was rather shocked to learn that a major tourist hotel bar closed so early. The hotel gym had the standard assortment of equipment found in most lower-upscale hotels - a rack of weights, a weight bench, a multi-use machine and several cardio machines (nice assortment). Adding just 1 more weight bench would improve functionality significantly. While the fitness area was generally clean, the frequency of housekeeping visits was inadequate. Water cups were not restocked and dirty towels were not collected very often. The hotel is close to Union Square, but also on the border of the Tenderloin district. We were advised several times by locals to head in only 2 directions from the hotel to stay in safe areas. The hotel tends to market itself as in the Nob Hill area. While Nob Hill is not far away, the hotel is not in Nob Hill by any stretch of liberal geography. More attention from management experienced in knowing the minor details that differentiate a good from a superior hotel experience would go a long way at this hotel.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel in the the Heart of San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "Q2SHOOT", "ReviewID": "UR116475563", "Content": "We stayed here three nights at the start of our roadtrip to Los Angeles.

My sister found it at a great rate and it was a gem of a hotel! The decor of the hotel is gorgeous - beautiful lobby and sitting areas. There was always a doorman outside to assist with directions or hailing a taxi if needed. The location was central to everything - we walked down to the wharf - a long walk, but definitely doable! (about 24 city blocks) A few blocks to the left of hotel is Chinatown and two blocks up was Powell and easy access to the cable cars, Union Square and lots of shopping. A convenient Walgreen's is located directly across the street if you need any water, snacks or toiletries. Starbucks is a short walk away for a great quick breakfast. The hotel always had water and a special \"refresher\" drink in the lobby when you walked in if you needed something right then. Everyday at 5 pm the hotel offered a wine reception for one hour. It was advertised as a wine/beer/mixed drinks/sangria reception with chef inspired offerings. The chef inspired offering the night we went was pretzels - so a little bit of a let down. They were also only offering sangria, a white wine and a red wine. We still enjoyed the free beverages during the hour and thought it was a nice touch. Our room was great - perfectly sized for the four of us. Very nice thread count on the sheets, beds were great and we were given option of feather pillows, foam or cotton. Nice toiletries as well - Aveda products. Our room was very clean and stocked with plenty of towels, hangers, etc. The staff was very helpful, especially with dining recommendations or with directions. My niece got sick the night before we checked out and they let us stay in our room several hours past check out until it was time for us to depart for the airport. This allowed my niece to rest until we had to leave and this helped very much in her recovery so she wasn't sick while we were flying! This was a huge plus for us and the staff could not have been helpful, especially when we needed the extra help! The only steep thing about the hotel is parking - self park is $45 or valet is $50. We opted for the valet. But parking is expensive EVERYWHERE in San Francisco, so if you drive in, just figure parking into your trip costs.

While the decor may be a little flamboyant for some tastes, it certainly provides a pleasant departure from the typical mainstream hotel experience. Monaco lobbies are feasts of color and theatrical flourishes, decked out with stylish furniture, bold fabrics and other touches which establish a cheerful tone. The presence of guests' well behaved dogs also lends a rather homey atmosphere to a clearly chic, upscale experience. Despite all the elegance, this is a mid-tier, mid-price hotel, an affordable luxury which provides quite a treat for a vacation or get-away weekend. The rooms carry on the color and drama of the lobbies and are very comfortable and well maintained. We have selected suites on each visit and find the extra space well worth the cost since the standard rooms have felt a little small at the Monaco's property in Denver. The standards of the hotel are quite high despite the moderate price point and all the amenities from the jazzy robes to large marble bathrooms to well chosen furniture reflect well on the management of this chain. The staff are wonderful and very professional. We especially approve of the room service and bar dining option at the Monaco. While the formal restaurant is there if you need it, its menu is unexceptional and there are better dining experiences all over San Francisco. The bar, however, is a very comfortable place to hang out and dine on an excellent selection of various bar foods from burgers to calamari to raw oysters. The presence of this bar dining option is a real plus in considering the Monaco since it takes all the pressure off the dinner hour when a major dining experience may not be required every night of your stay. Our one slight negative on this hotel is its location which is off Union Square rather than on it. While two extra blocks aren't a huge deal, the twentieth time you walk them could matter to you.

As we were planing to attend a play and experience some night life we wanted to stay in the downtown/theater section of San Francisco. The Hotel Monaco is right on Geary Street, a main East/West thoroughfare that runs from Market Street to the ocean. The hotel is within a block of the A.C.T. Theater and many fine eateries are also a short walk or brief taxi ride away. This was our first stay at the Monaco. As we entered the hotel we were very impressed with the high domed ceilings that gives a sense of a vastness of space in the foyer and the adjacent spaces off of the lobby. Pictures of bi-planes and balloons are painted on the ceilings off of the entrance. The \"living room\" adjacent to the lobby is comfortable with overstuffed chairs and a long high back sofa. An evening happy hour is celebrated in this area. Once checked in we were welcomed by a brightly lit hallway featuring bright red walls when we arrived at our floor. Our room was just the right size and all of the expected sundries were included in this immaculate space. The view from our room did overlook a storage area for garbage dumpsters but we chose to look up and see just a bit of the downtown area. Although the view wasn't much, being at the back of the property insured a very quiet and peaceful couple of night's sleep. As with all of the hotels of this chain, the room furnishings are kitschy and a bit over the top. The room colors are bold. The wall paper was silver and black vertical stripes. There was what can best be described as an awning hanging directly over the bed and it was accessorized with pairs of mens' trouser belts. Believe me, I'm not making this up - just reporting what was there! A fun room. The entire hotel staff were very professional and it is apparent that they are proud to work at The Monaco. Adjacent and connecting to the Hotel Monaco is the Grand Cafe Bistro and Restaurant. We ate brunch at the Grand cafe and the food was very good Between five and seven the bar at the restaurant serves up some very tasty raw and baked oysters for about a buck-fifty per oyster, and we enjoyed a pre-night-on-the-town snack of oysters and champagne for a very modest sum.

Of all the Kimpton hotels there, we felt the Union Square location was best (and loved the boutique feel of the Monaco vs the other Kimpton options). This hotel is literally right next door to The Clift, which I'm personally not a fan of... being an LA resident, we have plenty of Phillipe Stark-clubby-atmosphere-sceney opportunities. Plus the rooms at the Monaco are MUCH more spacious than the Clift. We arrived on the early Sat morning flight (in the city by 8am) and had hoped to leave our bags at the hotel while we explored the city until afternoon check-in. We were most pleasantly surprised to learn that our room was not only ready but that they'd let us check in so early... score! The staff was most friendly and accommodating, offering to make transportation arrangements for us throughout our stay. The complimentary fresh spa water (strawberry, orange, etc) was a nice touch, along with the morning coffee bar and afternoon wine hour. The bathrooms were super clean and had plenty of available amenities. We didn't order room service but it was good to see a few yummy healthy options listed for each meal below the usual decadence. The only reason I took off a star (and would rate the experience Very Good vs Excellent) - Being a fan of spas of all kinds, I partially chose this hotel for the 24hr fitness room, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. We had inquired about the spa hours (9am-9pm, and someone could let us in after hours if necessary). I was mainly looking forward to relaxing in the warm sauna but was quite disappointed to find the sauna 'out of order'. Ok fine, managed to enjoy the steam & jacuzzi in it's place. The 2nd day there was a 'closed' sign on the jacuzzi as well. We called the front desk, who cited 'maintenance'. My husband saw the maintenance guy later, who mentioned they couldn't get the chemical balance right in the jacuzzi. Being Memorial Day weekend (and the fact that this is a Kimpton, known for their service and the hotel seemed pretty busy/full) I'm surprised this wasn't taken care of. Even on day 3 only the steam room was available. Overall, we were very pleased with the rooms, our stay and the service.

The Monaco is located between the upscale Union Square and the downscale Tenderloin, so expect to see a mix of high-life and low-life on the streets. It is convenient to the Theatre District, transit, shopping and museums like SFMOMA. The evening wine reception is a nice touch, and unlike most luxury hotels which charge a fortune for internet, you can get free Wi-Fi if you join their loyalty program. Parking fees in the city are not for the faint of heart, but you can save a little money by using a self-park garage around the block.

Monaco appears to have none after my diligent search of my room, so it passes on that front. But, I did have one annoying experience with the staff in the wee hours of a Sat. 9 April that was annoying. I ended up in SF for a week for a conference but was very ill with a cold the entire time. The rooms have no small coffee makers like many do. I rarely use this, but desperately needed one this time to make theraflu, which is the only cold-symptom medication that works well for me. I spent most of the week getting hot water (kindly given for free) from Starbucks across street. But at 4AM on Saturday morning, I coughed myself awake, couldn't sleep, & got desperate. I went down looking to see if the morning coffee I was promised at check-in was out yet. It wasn't. I explained to front desk how ill I was, showed them the theraflu packet I was desperate to make, and asked if they could please get me some hot water. Porter arrived in 15 minutes with hot water and no mug. I asked for one, the porter said: \"You have glasses, see!\" I said, \"no mugs, nothing with a handle\". He said: \"You have glasses.\" and left. I felt the easiest way not to make trouble was to go back downstairs and to get one of the mugs I'd seen out in big stacks in the coffee area downstairs. I got one, the front desk started saying: \"The porter will be there soon\". I said: \"Yeah, he came, but brought no mug for me; I came to get one\". Answer: \"Sir, don't take that mug. That's for a private function. You can't take that mug!\" The guy kept yelling as I entered the elevator; I half-expected him to chase me up to my room to retrieve this mug I'd \"stolen\" from the private function. Now, this is an *empty* mug. It belongs to the hotel. I'm taking it back to my room, at the hotel! Do they really have so few mugs that I can't borrow one to prepare my cold medication at 4AM? He's really going to yell at a \"mug stealing\" customer at 4:30AM who's already told him that he's very sick and desperately needs to prepare some symptom medicine? I realize fully this is one poor decision by a night staffer not thinking through the situation. One shouldn't judge the whole hotel on one incident like this.

Every person from the front desk people to the concierge, to the cleaning ladies were so helpful and polite.

I couldn't think of anything else to start our trip better. One thing we were really glad about was how good the coffee was. With us being from New England we wouldn't have our Dunkin Donuts for a week but the coffee (free) at the Hotel Monaco was awesome. The water in the lobby infused with lemons, oranges, or cucumbers was also a great touch. Although we never attended, the daily wine socials seemed like a great idea also.

On a previous visit, we had stayed at the Omni (GREAT hotel) near the Financial District, but on this visit we wanted to be a little closer to Union Square. Reading the reviews on Trip Advisor (as I always do) we settled on the Hotel Monaco. It turned out to be a great decision. During our cab ride from the airport, I explained to the driver where we had previously stayed and I asked him about the Hotel Monaco. He said that while, in his opinion, it wasn't quite the Omni, it was indeed a very nice place with a good reputation for service. He did, however, caution us that it was near the edge of the \"Tenderloin\" section of SF and that we should not venture too far in that direction, particularly at night. This, of course, mirrored several comments that I had seen in several Trip Advisor reviews when talking about the Hotel Monaco's location. In point of fact, however, the location (two blocks off of Union Square in the middle of the Theatre District) turned out to be one of the best things about the hotel. Convenient access to the cable cars, near Union Square, and within walking distance to the Westfield Mall. Knowing that we would be arriving before normal check-in, I had contacted the hotel to make arrangements for an early check-in. Communication was great and I had received an email from the Front Desk Manager assuring me that we could be accommodated. Sure enough, when we arrived (nearly three hours before normal check-in) our room was ready and available to us. Is that fantastic customer service, or what? (Thank you Christine.) The room was clean, smartly decorated, and the beds were very comfortable. The nightly hosted wine hour was a very nice touch. I would recommend obtaining a free Klimpton InTouch Membership before your visit. The membership entitles you to free internet and a number of other worthwhile services.

That evening I noticed one of the little touches the other reviewers mentioned. A plate with cookies and a personal note. For another couple... The travel agency had booked including breakfast. Unfortunately, as I don't eat bread, and the standard breakfast turned out to be continental. Explanations didn't help, there was no way to change the breakfast vouchers to American breakfast. (I was offered a reduced price for an additional omelet though). There are several excellent breakfast places in the area, so I took my loss, but again, not a warm feeling. If anyone wants some vouchers, I still haven them ;-) Those were the first 12 hours, the rest of my stay was genuinely positive. The lady at the front desk turned out to be an exception, or have had a bad day, and despite the rough start I learned to like the hotel. The positive reviews are right - this is a pleasant little hotel in a bustling neighborhood. Cozy room, a bit on the small side, but big enough, free WiFi that actually works, friendly staff, the wine hour (that I missed), free newspaper and morning coffee. A bit noisy; I could hear my neighbors on both sides, but slept well. As a jet lagged traveler I found out that the shower takes ages to warm up at 6 am, but at 7 it's nice and hot, so that wouldn't bother most travelers.

The Monaco has none of these. The rooms while clean, are small. I found the furnishings overly quirky and fussy, furnishings that might appeal to my eccentric aunt, but not to a modern traveler looking for stylish accomodations. The hotel is located in an older and undistinguished renovated seven story building on a busy street with no views. I highlight the lack of views because San Francisco is a beautiful city with many hills - one of the great charms of staying in this city is to have a room with a view of the skyline or the bay.

I had to look for the hotels as well that I actually did not find good on expedia, so I google and found hotels2stay.net and I got the best hotel rates for San Francisco and I quickly book my hotel room as it was discount going on on 3rd night. It was a free night if I stay for 2 nights, I get the 3rd night free of cost. So It was really good and I got my flight and hotel done.

It was embarrassing moment for me, but fortunately I had my notebook with me where I had just login to my email account and took another print out of the hotel booking confirmation that I had received from hotels2stay. And everything was again on track. I had been transferred to my deluxe king room with everything in the room. Fabulous hotel room it was. My room was nicely decorated and comfortable bedding was there. Walls were well painted and covering with wall paper. I did enjoy complimentary wine at 5 O Clock nightly in the lounge downstairs.

There are not many hotels in SF that have this set up at a remotely reasonable price, so Monaco it was. As mentioned by many others, the staff are attentive and very nice. I stayed in a deluxe suite, which was nice - size very large, though when pull out sofa was pulled out, it was impossible to cross the living room and actually exit the suite. Just as the \"W look\" has gotten a bit tired as it's been adopted by other hotels, the \"Monaco-look\" (hipped-up Renaissance Italy) seems even more tired. Many minor annoyances in the room - toilet clogged up twice and the electronic door would fail to recognize my key daily despite protecting it from demagnitization. The bigger issues were amenities - breakfast at the Grand Cafe really is not suited to business travelers - very limited menu, very expensive, notihing really remotely healthy. The location of the hotel is actually NOT great - borders on the popular union square area, but really more firmly rooted in the Tenderloin. Homeless beggars are incessant, and any walk to the MUNI/BART or convention center is either very indirectly routed around tenderloin or directly through it. And I used to live in SF, so I know t he city well...Other \"frills\" seemed tired - the animal print robes were actually very old and not soft at all, etc. So all in all, a pleasant stay, but given the myriad of choices in SF, I'm not sure I'd be back.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cMy new favorite SF Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DarbyCooper", "ReviewID": "UR56189318", "Content": "Just so you know my taste, The Fairmont is my favorite SF hotel.

The Good: Clean, quiet and gorgeous with excellent service. The friendly staff made us feel very comfortable. I loved that the cleaning crew was quiet in the mornings. I didn't hear anything in the hallways. I can't stand it when I hear the maids yelling to each other in the halls. Hello! I'm on vacation - trying to sleep here! The front desk staff booked the perfect place for a business dinner we were hosting. It was exactly what we wanted. The staff know the city well, which is tough with all of the excellent options in SF. For Kimpton members, they have free Wifi. I consider that essential at any hotel. They even gave us a voucher for $10 worth of goods from the minibar, which was well stocked with lots of different choices. I loved that they had a DVD player and stereo with CD's in the room. I didn't have to play everything off of the computer. I fell in love with our goldfish. The location is excellent. Walking distance to BART. Not too close to Union Square so it's quiet and not too far out of the Theater District to be in the Tenderloin. Walking distance from the two best diners in the city (Pinecrest and Dotty's). The free cocktail hour, hot chocolate at 2:00 and morning coffee and tea bar in the lounge by the fireplace were fantastic. They had Wii set up to play one night and another night we watched the Olympics. It's all the little things that make this place so fun to stay in. Could Use Improvement: I ordered oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar from Room Service. I was given only oatmeal with four raisins and nothing else. When I order room service, for $16 (after charges), I expect to be given several different condiment options with my order, in addition to what is listed on the menu of course. Room Service promptly fixed their mistake. The guy was at my door in under three minutes. Still, no milk, no butter, no extra raisins...have these people never eaten oatmeal before? So, the room service is pretty lame. Lastly, I agree with the person who said that their pillows are funky. They are like too puffy. I had a hard time sleeping on them the first night but, then I got used to it. And was way too comfortable in that bed because I took about 100 naps. I couldn't get the radio/ iPod player to work - but that may have been user error/the iPhone wouldn't work with it. Other than that, I loved this hotel.

There are no tea or coffee making facilities which is really annoying as I had to dash to Starbucks a few times. A cup of tea on room service was $8.50! The spa is great but the steamroom smelled like a steam iron so didnt have a nice eucalyptus smell, and the sauna only had heat so felt more like roast chicken than relaxing sauna as there was no option to add water.

It was just that good and we had to see it they could maintain those standards. Not only were they maintained, but in my estimation, they were enhanced. The hotel is just so cozy and comfortable, especially with the fireplace. Although the rooms can be small, they are quite well appointed. Last year I had opportunity to stay in both a smaller queen bed room and then a beautiful larger king bed room, but this year I just stayed in a smaller room and it was quite fine. As comfortable as they hotel is, the strongest suit has to be the warm, accommodating staff. Actually, one should have very few needs while staying at the Monaco, but it comforting to sense that the staff is receptive. At the Monaco, it would be much easier to attempt to highlight someone who might not be doing a fabulous job, as opposed to listing the people who are wonderful because virtually everyone you encounter is worthy of positive notice. I must mention, though, that I remember Francess and Tim R.A. Now fondly from last year and must note that it speaks well of the hotel that they maintain such fine employees. Also Jian's positive nature and helpfulness really stood out as well. I did notice that the previous reviewer mentioned appreciation about the Monaco being a dog friendly hotel. Actually I am not a dog person, particularly not a big dog person. Unlike last year, when there were no dogs and, as far as pets, all I heard about was the fact that goldfish are available to keep in the room, this year big dogs seemed to be ubiquitous and I could envision most of the owner's wearing invisible versions of the \"dogs are the new kids\" t-shirts.

I am so glad I did! The hotel itself was beautiful and well maintained. The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. We booked a double double room for our teenage daughters and a deluxe queen for my husband and myself. We were able to get an early check in at 12pm for the girls room. When we came back later to check into our room we found we had also been put in a double double ( which is larger and more expensive ) instead of a queen. The desk said they had upgraded us at no charge but if we would prefer a queen they would be happy to move us. We decided to stay put since the room was bigger and nice, but I would have liked to see what the queen looked like. Unfortunately, our girls ended up with a bigger room and bathroom than we did! I did peek in a few rooms from the hallway as they were being cleaned and they seemed to vary in size and/or layout. I had been worried about room size because many reviews on San Fran hotels, in general, say that rooms are small, but we found these to be comfortable and large enough. We loved the decor and the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. They have a stocked minifridge in every room but you can move stuff out of the way to put your own food and drinks in. The cleaning staff was very nice and accomodating. Its a pet friendly hotel but there was no problem with pet odors.The only complaint we had was that there was a lot of clanging noise from the street early in the mornings that could be heard very loudly from our 3rd floor streetside rooms. Don't know what was going on down there! They have a complimentary wine reception every evening that was very well attended by guests. Its supposed to run from 5-6pm but I often saw it going on until closer to 7. Also during wine hour they offer free 10 minute massages and they have a large screen and Wii game set up. Location was great. Two blocks from the cable cars and right on the bus line. We bought a 7 day transportation pass to use on cable cars, streetcars, and buses which paid for itself in 2 days. Easy to get around on public transportation and walking distance to many attractions. There is a dicey area about 2-3 blocks away called the Tenderloin district, but its easy to stay away from because most attractions are in the other direction. I would highly recommend joining the Kimpton Club after you make your reservation because they periodically offer special deals by email to members.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never stayed at a Kimpton property before, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a fan after this stay. The decoration is really fabulous and feels kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153funky posh.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another reviewer mentioned hideous wallpaper in some of the rooms and I do have to agree on that point, during my stay I saw the interior of several rooms when they were being cleaned and not all have that nauseating yellow/green striped wallpaper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an off-note in a hotel that is otherwise so beautifully decorated. The gold/red in the bathroom is much more pleasing. The bed and linens are first rate and extremely comfortable. Towels in the bathroom could be a little bigger and plusher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they also have a faint smell of having been laundered with the kitchen towels from the restaurant. I wish hotels would figure out that they have to keep those carefully separated. I also found my room to be pleasantly quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel was full but I never once heard other guest voices or Television noise while in my room (my perennial complaint at hotels..having to listen to the TV from the room next door.) The old style windows actually open to provide fresh air (there is no AC, but not really needed in San Fran unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiencing a rare heat wave.) Even with the windows closed there was only a faint occasional sound of the usual city sirens wailing. The hotel really needs to be clearer about their spa. What the website currently does not explain is that the spa downstairs is open (Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna) to guests but has to be unlocked for each use since the hotel does not have an attendant on duty. Treatments (facials/massages) are all being done directly in guests rooms while they finish the spa renovation. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the fitness center due to a recent injury but it looked well appointed with a variety of machines, yoga mats and free weights. Of the several times I used the spa, I was usually the only guest there (the spa facility is co-ed, so bring a suit.) There is a changing room with a shower and plenty of fresh towels. The in-room safe is easy to use. The honor bar does have a small refrigerator, but it is fully packed and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to pull stuff out of it in order to use it for personal supplies. Once I got the WiFi figured out, it was a breeze and speeds were reasonable for wireless. I love hotels that provide an iHome in the room, so a big Thank You to Kimpton for that treat! The wine reception between 5 and 6 pm each day is very popular, but they end promptly at 6, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be late! There are no coffee makers in the rooms, but the downstairs coffee arrangement in the morning is plenty sufficient. The hotel will deliver the NY Times to your door every day (and charge you for it) unless you specifically ask them not to. Very wasteful for a supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. Across the street is a Walgreens for supplies and small grocery. San Fran is expensive; expect everything to cost 25-30% more than back home. Even the greasy-spoon diner down the street had outrageous prices, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people traveling with kids ever afford San Francisco. The Grand Caf\u00c3\u00a9 restaurant attached to the hotel calls itself French-California (translation: Hip French) and has seriously excellent food. There are a few moderately priced items on the menu but expect to drop some coin, especially on wine or cocktails. It has a great atmosphere and an equally stellar staff as the hotel does (although it does sport some of the ugliest statuary I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run across.

Being in the Theatre District, the restaurant is fairly popular with the pre and post theatre crowd (dinner before, dessert and drinks afterward.)

It was a steal. The '4' score rather than a '5' relates to some staffing issues and need for a bit more employee training.

Maybe it's the former hotel front office manager in me, but I'd like to see more eye contact and recognition from the employees. A bellman and a manager of some sort had a conversation for several minutes while I was standing 5 feet from them waiting to retrieve some bags, and not once did either of them look over and acknowledge that I was waiting.

We were unable to book the Hilton for 3 nights in a row at the price we wanted so we fortunately were able to book the 3rd night at Hotel Monaco. We wanted to stay in the Union Square area - moving hotels can be hectic and we wanted a pleasant stay for our last evening in SF. Even though it was only for 1 night we found our stay at this hotel to be the most pleasant of the 3 nights we stayed in SF. The reception service was personalized, friendly and thorough - even though we got in early (1pm), she was able to check us in right away. We had booked the room on Priceline - and she mentioned that they will do pricematching next time (& I think one reviewer mentioned this as well). The room is not huge - as expected in a boutique city hotel, but we enjoyed the decor of our room, nice bed and the Aveda products. & very clean of course. (though we weren't as excited about the leopard skin pattern bath robes...mainly because it had been washed out a bit and wasn't so fluffy..) We found it to be very service oriented and traveler friendly - for them to list out what additional bathroom amenities you could request for free (ex. tooth brush) and what other items you could request for a fee. They have complimentary wine receptions from 5-6pm - and unfortunately we missed the reception. However, we were further delighted to find out that we could still enjoy a complimentary glass of the featured wine at the hotel's restaurant (Grand Cafe). This was such a lovely perk to a long day of walking up and down the hills of SF. We tried out the Grand Cafe restaurant for dinner - we noticed that the menu looked interesting and we were also too tired to walk much more that evening. The dining area in the back is actually very airy and spacious which we found to be nice and relaxing as well. The restaurant did not disappoint. We had a nice gnocchi dish and we also enjoyed the appetizers. Recommend the restaurant. One more comment about their service: When we were rushing to leave - to catch a morning flight out of SFO, my boyfriend had misplaced his I-Pod and we couldn't find it. We looked under the bed etc but ran out of time so we left. When we were checking out, we mentioned this to the receptionist and she gave us a card to call later for lost and found. We did after arriving back to NYC and there was nothing reported by the cleaning staff in our room, however the man personally went to check again and called us back right away!! He had found it well hidden under the dressor - and the cleaning staff didn't even catch it. We were so pleased that they would go out of their way to check and report it back to us so promptly. & we definitely recommend the hotel!

We tried two of the restaurants suggested and both were outstanding. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that they upgraded us to a Queen Suite! What a wonderful surprise! Another huge perk of the Hotel Monaco was the 5-6pm complimentary wine in the lobby every evening. We ended up making it back for the wine each evening and it was a wonderful chance to relax and talk about all the sight-seeing we had done that day. After relaxing we were always ready to head out and find a great place to eat dinner and spend the rest of our evening. We also were able to mingle with other hotel guest and have enjoyable conversations. A couple of things about the area that we found helpful is that the trolley is only a few blocks away. Also the bus system is very efficient after you get the hang of the route system. It took us a day and a half before we got a hold of a good bus map, so if you plan on using the bus system I would recommend seeking a good map out right away.

If you're looking to visit S.F. and like hotels that offer style, comfort and wonderful service we would strongly recommend the Hotel Monaco. The Hotel is located in the Theatre district just a short walk from the shops of Union Square. From the Hotel door it is walkable to just about every part of the city; but for non-walkers the cable cars, buses, and (relatively expensive) taxis are available right outside the door or just around the corner. Our double room was not only stylish but clean, well-equipped, and spacious enough for 2 adults. The 2 double beds were as lovely to sleep in as they were to look at--with beautiful linens and ample, down pillows. The bath was pristine clean and very nicely outfitted with over-sized bath towels and courtesy robes with crazy tiger and zebra prints reflecting the very deco-style of the hotel itself. We were celebrating a birthday and James, the excellent concierge, recommended and arranged a fantastic, fine and filling dinner at Scala's Bistro (see separate review for details.) Thank you, James for the wonderful recommendation and your help getting us in for dinner on such short notice! In fact, all the staff we interacted with at the Monaco--from doorman to housekeepers--were wonderful! I wouldn't expect to receive better customer service at the Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons--simply put, the service was beyond my very picky expectations! The area around the hotel is well lit and due to the nearby theatres and restaurants is busy so we felt safe and comfortable walking the main streets both day & night. As for convenience, the Walgreens across the street has just about anything one could need while traveling and the Grand Cafe next door serves a fantastic Sunday brunch and has an extensive bar. We will definitely plan on returning to Hotel Monaco in the future and would certainly recommend it to friends, family & fellow travelers. As always, more than happy to answer specific questions about our experience at the Hotel.

The bed was one of the most comfortable I have experienced in a hotel. We got an inside room on the 3rd floor and could hear no traffic noise which is unusual for San Francisco. The wine and cheese reception in the evening was great. It was a good chance to talk to other guests. The only problem the first evening was that some guests allowed their children to play in the cheese dish. This was not the fault of the hotel but of parents who have no control of their little charmers. The next night there were thankfully no children present. The comments about the neighborhood being dangerous were really off base. The Tenderloin starts about a block west of the Monaco and if you choose to walk in that direction it isn't dangerous. Just go about your business like you know where you are going. You might be approached by street people but if you ignore them they pose no threat.

This is unusual for San Francisco where traffic noise and sirens are the norm. Housekeeping was spotless. The bathroom was as clean and spotless as our home. The shower pressure was great and the water hot.. The bathrobes were a little heavy but warm. Like the stripped room having tiger and leopard bathrobes were fun. The wine and cheese reception was wonderful. The first night a number of children from about 2 to 8 years old who were with their parents (not under their control) spoiled the atmosphere. They were playing with the cheese which was on a table. One 2 year old had great fun touching each piece of cheese with their cute little hands. The parents were not at all concerned and if an employee would have said something I don't think the parents would have responded positively. The second night (Sunday) there were no children at the reception so it was a very pleasant affair with good conversation with other guests. Since we had a few hours between checkout and our Amtrak bus we stored our luggage in a locked storage area.

The Meeting Room I bring the projector and laptop for our group to use so this is important to me. The wires and screen were there and ready everyday for my use. Tables, food, drink, notepads, pens were all set up in advance of our arrival every morning. The room and amenities were clean, really really clean.

The old buildings just are not that large to allow for huge spaces no matter the price ( Unless you are a big fish and can pay for the penthouse). That being said and having stayed in many hotels in SF, this place is great and a favorite. What I like: The staff- Very friendly and helpful. Not trendy or snobby like the Clift Hotel across the street. Perks- Wine and cheese every night, and the staff goes out of the way to make your stay comfortable. The rooms- Clean and recently remodeled and decent sized (for SF), modern whimsical design and comfortable. Quiet if you ( again like any big city hotel) ask ahead for such a room (upper floor or back of hotel not facing street) I recommend the King rooms. You can pay a fortune and stay at the Ritz and the rooms won't be much larger- really, I have. The lobby and dining room- warm and fabulous if you like eclectic high style design. It is not traditional and I love that. The location - As a former SF'er, I think this is a perfect location as it is short walk to Union square, theater, cable car, or a small cab fare to anything. Some other hotels are on top of Nob Hill and can be a pain (literally) if you like to city walk back home after dinner or shopping. My wife and I personally walk all over SF from here and never feel unsafe. Beggars, massage parlors, various seedy characters are all over SF like NY or any major metropolis of this kind.

My wife and I both were a little concerned about staying so near what was reputed to be a bad area. I think the concern was partly justified in that the area nearby (Tenderloin) does not look safe and you would best avoid walking it (even the guide on the tour coach said it was dangerous). However the hotel doesnt closely border the area and guests who dont walk much further past the Monaco coming from Union Square direction should be perfectly safe. But as always in any major city keep your wits about you and keep wallets etc., secure. The hotel is located close to the AC Theatre and major shopping centres and there is a taxi rank just down the road. There are homeless all over San Francisco and not specifically in the hotels area. You can choose to ignore them and they wont bother you however we tried to give something whenever we had the change. We booked in June and got a good rate of $299 for a Queen canopy room. When we got there we found it wasnt the requested smoking room. After one night we were moved to a smoking suite on the top floor which was an immensely better room with the same rate (thanks Kirby!). The room facilities were excellent with one exception.

This however was a very minor thing when balanced against the professional, friendly and courteous staff we found from the doorman through concierge, front desk staff and bell hop. The room was cleaned thoroughly each day and towels etc changed. The L'Occitane freebies were nice and the decor tastefully designed. The restaurant/bar is pricey but then so is every other decent hotel and the price list is displayed clearly. With plenty of alternatives close by you dont have to eat there.

Thanks to this website and its reviews, we found it! We were there in mid-August, and the weather was actually fall-like, a nice break from 90-degree humid Ohio. NOTES: 1)The staff was very friendly -- it seemed everyone who worked there took pride in the place. We were able to check in early with no problem (couldn't say the same about the Bellagio in Vegas, where our room cost twice as much and service was lousy). 2) Freebies: Wine & Cheese Hour was fun, although the Tarot Card reader made it rather clear that although it was a free reading, a suggested gratuity of $20 would be appreciated -- the reading took about 3 minutes, so not a real good return on my investment there. In the morning, a New York Times is delivered to your door. They also have free Chronicles downstairs in the lobby. It was fun to sit in the living room in front of the fireplace and read the papers while getting geeked on free Starbucks. 3) There are a ton of great places to go to eat or have a drink within walking distance, including a cool bar \"Swig\" and an Irish bar a few blocks over toward the shopping area. The Olympic Cafe on the next block over doesn't look like much, but it has a good breakfast, and The Daily News Cafe (?) nearby was the best meal we had. Skip the hotel restaurant -- overpriced and we sat there 10 minutes waiting for a server to acknowledge us once we were seated. We ducked out of there and went to King of Thai Noodle, where we got great service for probably 1/6th of the price of a dinner back at the hotel. 4) At our request we did receive a fish, \"John\", who made it only 2 days out of our 7-day stay. I called the front desk when the fish turned on his side -- they promised to send someone up to get the fish and return it to the big aquarium, but no one came and John checked out (permanently) not long thereafter. 5) The hotel's location is great -- close to good shopping (Bloomie's, Nordstrom, etc.), the cable car lines, and all sorts of transit. I regret that we rented a car for the whole week we were there -- parking is really expensive, although the bellman did clue us into a cheaper garage around the corner from the hotel. Still, it worked out to be $32/day to park in that garage. 6) Our room was tiny, but decorated so cool -- the striped walls helped to make it seem bigger. The room also came with a game system and an alarm clock you could dock an iPod into. All in all, this hotel is exactly what I was looking for.

Ay, there's the rub. Now imagine that workers from a local brothel and circus became shareholders in the place and inserted their own flare every once in awhile throughout the joint. Put it all together and NOW you can envision the Hotel Monaco San Francisco. The bellmen look like pimps in purple velvet suits and hats. (I honestly thought I was being propositioned when one of them startled me from behind as I got out of the cab.) The bedrooms have two terry cloth bathrobes, one in zebra print the other leopard. The lamps in the rooms will remind you of the circus with their big block letters, and for some strange reason if you have a room with a canopy, the material and position of it will make it seem as though you are sleeping in a puppet theater. In the evenings you can head downstairs for a very strange happy hour that includes free wine, chair massages, and tarot card readings......I repeat tarot card readings! The place is zany, it's odd, it has some weird vintage travel/ brothel/circus interior design fusion going on, and frankly, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad at all if you are in the market for something unique. So, what was bad? Well, there are very few rooms with King beds and so we didn't get one and slept in a queen for 5 nights. The rooms are also very small. The ice machine is on a different floor, and personally, I think the pimped out bellmen are creepy. Also, the attached restaurant is French with very heavy food and poor service. I've been to France, I find the people lovely. The waiters at this place epitomized an old stereotype of French waiters: snooty and lacking in service. Oddly, it's as if they were trying to put on that air. But, there is no end to great food in The City, so it didn't matter that much, we just didn't go there again. The good? The rooms are totally unique, the staff is VERY responsive and friendly, and the hotel prides itself on being pet friendly. So pet friendly are they that if you had to leave your beloved pet at home, they will give you a pet goldfish for the duration of your stay. WA-WA-WHAT? That's right, ask for a pet goldfish and they will apparently bring you one and housekeeping will take care of it for you. Zany! Other good aspects, the toiletries from L'Occitane were very nice. The plantain shutters on the large windows were great, and the desk area was nice to work at. We also liked the location. As for homeless individuals in the area. . . . .welcome to San Francisco.

What an unusually gorgeous hotel with exceptionally good personal service. We booked the \"Ooh Baby Baby\" Romance package over the phone, which included a small suite, champagne with a personalized welcome note, and a 30 minute massage for 2. From the time we pulled up and turned our car over to the valet in front of the hotel, through the check-in process and being escorted to the Parlour Suite, we were treated like a couple who have been coming to the Monaco for years. The pictures on the web did not adequately represent how stunning the lobby is upon entry, nor can the staircase going upstairs be sufficiently described or photographed. Likewise, our suite was spacious and meticulously clean. The huge bathroom had a deep spa bathtub, which my wife loved. We got a chance to peek into some other rooms and they were very beautiful, regardless of size. Spaces throughout the hotel were works of great interior design artistry and it was fun to just walk around the hotel and discover the outstanding art, design and architecture. The Grand Cafe restaurant was also incredibly beautiful with monumental detail, whimsical scupture and oversized classic theater posters keeping with the fact that the hotel and restaurant are in the heart of SF's theater district featuring major plays. We can echo the sentiments of other reviewers writing here, but a couple of small problems must be noted. In the restaurant, that banana cream pie people are talking about, is the smallest piece of pastry I ever seen, 'cept for an Oreo cookie. The menu faire is outstanding, banana pie particle not withstanding. Also, if noise bugs you, like some one else said, do ear plugs or ask to be moved. Although the surrounding neighborhood is rich in SF culture with important world class galleries and the afore mentioned theaters, the streets are noisy as hell. When we were leaving, we left our belongings stored in their possession and walked the two blocks to Union Square to shop. When we returned, we were waiting for our bags when JESSE L. MARTIN from Law and Order came and checked in. I listened as he was asked by the clerk if he had been there before and Mr. Martin said, \"Yes, a couple of times.\" Pretty impressive for a hotel that I can afford.

And these are not the words of someone who only stayed there a couple of nights, I had plenty of time to observe them. Originally I was supposed to stay at the Hotel Monaco for only 4 nights but on my last day in San Francisco I fractured my leg and needed to have surgery. My surgeon told me I could not fly for 3 weeks after surgery, so I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 4 weeks. During the course of my stay, I stayed in 3 different rooms and was able to observe almost all the staff. There are not enough words to describe how wonderful the hotel and the staff are. A kinder group of people you cannot imagine. They went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and I ended up writing a long letter to the President of Kimpton hotels to tell him what an amazing staff they have there. Without fail they were all terrific. As to the rooms, I've read a few comments about dusty rooms. I can say honestly that while recovering from reconstructive surgery on my leg, I spent a great deal of time on my back in 3 different rooms there and they were all spotless. I was generally in the room while housekeeping was there, but whether I was there or not, the room was always clean, fresh and tidy. The decor of the rooms is bright, cheerful and charming. My first room was one of their tiny rooms, the smallest they have but it was so well-appointed, romantic and luxurious that I didn't care. After I broke my leg, they moved me to a handicapped room and then when someone was able to join me to help take care of me they moved me to a handicapped junior suite. These rooms are a bit bigger but they faced Geary Street which can be a bit noisy with ambulances and firetrucks at night. Don't let this put you off, any hotel in downtown SF will have the same issue, I put in ear plugs and had no more problems, or you can just ask for a quiet room not on Geary street. My first room was in the back and for my first four nights there was no noise at all. If you are in a wheelchair, make sure to specify you want a roll in shower as one of the handicapped rooms had it but the junior handicapped suite did not. The bathrooms are goregous. Such a well-run hotel. Oh, the first day I checked in, I asked for a goldfish. They sent one up in a fishbowl and that little guy turned out to be my companion for the next 4 weeks. It's a great touch from a hotel full of great touches. My friends have asked me when I come back to San Francisco if I'd stay there again considering all of the pain and trauma I went through.

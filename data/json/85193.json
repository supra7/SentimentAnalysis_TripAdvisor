I have stayed at this hotel twice now, with another reservation booked and based on my stays, further reservations guarateed to be made by me when needing a lay over at Miami airport. I used to use another big chain hotel nearby, but warily gave this hotel a try after reading the reviews. Its in a small business park and has a rather nice entrance. Room was newly renovated, standard size for such a hotel (chair, bed, desk, tv, bathroom, entrance door), food was good, called from dallas to let them know i would be late due to flight delays and the lady on front desk knew who i was as soon as i mentioned my name which i appreciated due to the hassle of flying (and having an international phone - no messing about). Slight error on my amex, email to the hotel, i think it was the general manager that emailed me back, and it was sorted immediately. No worries. On the back of this pleasant stay, booked to stay again a few weeks later and used some HHonours points to get an alcove room. What a room this turned out to be for what is essentially an airport/conference hotel! My room was the top floor of the right hand wing if you look up when facing the entrance. See all that glass curving round the wing? Most (if not all) of it is yours. Very quiet, big sofa, reclining leather seat and footstool, 2 large flatscreen tvs (one in the bedroom area, one in seating area), work space and lots of floor space in the sitting area due to the curved design of the room. All for a tiny premium over a standard room. Im sure there are different design of alcove rooms going by the pic on the website, and i will try these 'square' alcove rooms on another stay i'm sure, but request one of these corner ones if you can. View is great, how can it not be with that much glass. Chap at check-in was very pleasant. I must mention the food in the restaurant was a real surprise as well (service was a bit random though, one good and polite, one clearly had no idea about the basics for working in a restaurant), and the bottle of Zin i had was full of character. Down side? As everyone mentions the shuttle can seem to take a very long time. It wasnt a problem from the hotel - always left as advertised (every 20 mins i think, maybe 30), but seems like it just doesn't leave the hotel if no one is around at the hotel - it can't skip terminals as they are all on the same road. I waited an hour at terminal D this time even after calling the hotel a couple of times so they know you are waiting. I could just grab a cab, but you always think...its just coming, right? I know this is a recurring problem from talking to colleagues, and this really needs sorted. You do stand there watching other hotel shuttles (the exact same vehicles) passing by a few times which has got to lose this hotel business. Oh, and the shuttle is a tad old, but its a short trip after all. I booked an alcove room again for a future stay later in the year (cash). I was offered to upgrade for a small amount of points to upgrade to a King Suite, and i'm expecting good things. If you are still with me after all that, and if you are thinking of staying in this hotel, especially if you are flying through, give it a try and book an alcove room, the small extra cost is absolutely worth it, and honestly, I have yet to find a better room anywhere that you might use for airport layovers. Beware the renovations do appear to be ongoing from recent reviews here, but surely they will be finished before long since both times i have been there at the end of 2011 i have received a renovated room on a renovated floor.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derry", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Grounds but?\u201d", "Author": "OMGJ", "ReviewID": "UR125566922", "Content": "Stayed two nights with friends before embarking on a cruise.

There are beautiful walks by the lake on a decked area. Hotel staff tend to be impersonal - due no doubt to a large turnover of guests but you do expect at this price to have more convivial service. There is a limited lunch menu, we chose burgers and were not disappointed. However, their wines are very expensive. This is an airport hotel but the pool area makes it suitable for a short vacation - if like me you enjoy watching planes.

The shuttle from the airport is sometimes problematic because if it fills up they don't run extra shuttles. If this happens either get a cab ($20) or start walking to the left on the sidewalk. The shuttle goes from left to right. Airlines on the right end of the terminal (United, US Air) sometimes have this problem. Save money tip for a long weekend. Take the shuttle to the hotel, rent a car there (Hertz has a desk at the hotel, as well as another car company I don't remember), and drive whereever you're going. Drive back Sunday, drop the car off, and stay at the hotel Sunday night.

The property is pretty, including a jogging route, and a nice walk around the property and out into the lagoon to see if you could spot a manatee (alas, we did not). The pool could have been cleaner - the deep end had not inconsequential grime and algae issues. Our bathroom was especially nice, looked like it was renovated relatively recently, and had good bath products. No free wifi in the room was a minus (see below). Nice view from the window of the lagoon surrounding us, and of downtown Miami, but the exterior window was dirty enough to harm the view. Bed was too soft for our liking, but some might enjoy a soft bed. Not exclusive to this hotel, and a common policy among its peers, amenities like parking and wifi were not free. They were free to HHonors members, but apparently my HHonors membership was dumped w/o telling me six months ago due to inactivity (despite having spent some of our Hawaii vacation for a few days at their not-cheap Hilton Waikoloa). As a teacher, I'm a leisure traveler - am I supposed to stay in a Hilton every six months? To be fair, wifi was free in the lobby. But at this price point, why am I being nickeled and dimed? I could stay at the Holiday Inn for about the same rate, but get free wifi and parking (and I'm now asking myself why I didn't ...) Finally, bad service did not help matters. My wife wanted to check in and print our boarding passes at the business center. For a hotel who sells itself on airport-related service, printing boarding passes should be near the top of the list. She had the hardest time with the computers and their Internet connection, and the harried desk staff were less than helpful, claiming that the Internet service was provided by a third party.

Not typically the thing to do on vacation, but the Hilton is set at the end of a peninsula in the middle of a small lake on the other side of the highway from the airport ... actually, a surprisingly nice setting! Also, the highway goes directly to downtown Miami and further over to Miami Beach, as well as connecting to the other major roads (like the turnpike down to the keys and everglades) so it's quite convenient. The hotel itself is quite large (14 floors, I think) and has been around a while (my guess is it was built sometime in the 1960s), but it's been mostly renovated (the front desk clerk said they were currently renovating the top couple of floors) ... however, the elevators really need to be replaced (more on that later). In the back, there's a nice pool and hot tub, with an outside bar and walkway to a gazebo at the tip of the peninsula ... quite relaxing, if you ignore the occasional passing jet airliner. As a Hilton diamond member, since the club floors were closed for renovations, we were put in a very nice suite on the 11th floor with a balcony, separate living room, updated bathroom, and king bed. Only problem was the room was right next to the elevators ... and they were so loud, that you could hear them anytime they were used, on any floor! I'm sure if they were replaced, they would be quieter ... but at their advanced age, with all the use they get, they were very noisy! We had to keep the a/c fan on all night to try to mask the noise.

All rooms are clean and comfortable, but I prefer a balcony room if available as I love to watch the planes take off! (As if I didn't fly enough for work). The hotel is literally right across the freeway from the airport, but is surprisingly pretty soundproof - I never have trouble sleeping in the comfy bed. You can watch the planes fly right by - great photo shots for the enthusiast. The property itself feels more like a resort than an airport hotel. It has a huge pool with plenty of seating and lounging area, as well as an outdoor pool bar. The hotel sits on a waterway too, and there is a nice walkway out the back to a gazebo. There is also a nicely marking walking trail around the property. As a Diamond member I got an appetizer in the lounge and non-alcoholic drink coupon to use, as well as continental breakfast in the restaraunt, which can be upgraded for an additional charge. The lounge is right off the lobby, and adjacent to the restaraunt. The inhouse restaraunt is good for a light dinner after a long travel day, and the breakfast buffet is good to get you going; especially if you're heading out on a cruise!

Overall it is a decent place to stay - staff was mostly nice and we did get a renovated room which was nice. The hotel is located directly across from the airport, which is very convenient. There is a nice garden area and walkway out into the water. I have a personal thing against major hotels (Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, etc.) that offer the same (or less) amenities as other hotels but try to charge far more. So that being said, here's my perspective: Positives - Renovated rooms are very comfortable and fresh feeling - Airport shuttle is free and convenient - Hotel is close to restaurants and stores Negatives - As a previous reviewer stated, the pool and jacuzzi were not heated as advertised. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to relaxing during the evenings. Hilton should've put this on their website to tell their guests. - This may be typical, but this Hilton likes to nickel-and-dime you for everything. Parking is $15 a night, internet is $12.95 (I think) per night...and don't get me started on breakfast. A basic continental breakfast that would be free at most Holiday Inn Express, Homewood Suites, or Hampton hotels will cost you $14+ at this Hilton. A cup of juice at the Express Cafe was $4-5!! They will also charge you to use internet and printing in the business center - another free amentity at normal hotels. - Also, as previous reviewer said - you may want to check on construction before coming. Wasn't a major problem but I could hear drilling and hammering during the daytime. In summary, if you prefer Hiltons this is a decent place with comfortable rooms. But if you don't like being nickeled and dimed, and prefer heated pools, I would recommend checking out the Homewood Suites, Hampton Inn, or something comparable in the area. You will most likely save some good $$ and get free breakfast included.

When the van arrived the driver was friendly and helpful, and it took only about 10 minutes to get to the hotel. The hotel was quiet due to the holiday and check in was helpful - the lady on receptionist very helpful. Unfortunately most of her advice was useless as I was leaving very early the next day. I had one of the newly refurbished rooms on a high floor. It was clean and fresh and I liked the appearence. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space. I had a spectacular view over the pool and Blue Lagoon toward downtown, made more interesting by the aircraft arrivals passing by. The bathroom had also been refurbished - frusrtatingly it had a large walk in shower, which in itself was not a problem, but this was at the expense of a tub. And after a long flight, I like a soak in the tub. The towels appeared new, but there were no washcloths which was again frustrating. I ate in the bar - it was dead with only one other person in there, and service was friendly and efficient. I'd have rated this property with 5 stars if the bathroom had contained a bath, if there had been washcloths, and if the shuttle had come quickly. But I will still give 4 stars as the hotel was nice, the refurbished room works well, and everyone was very friendly.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Richmond, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Property With Just a Few Minor Negatives\u201d", "Author": "orr333", "ReviewID": "UR117669655", "Content": "When I checked in I noticed that they had a sign up advertising that they are currently renovating rooms.

I am not superstitious but I cannot remember the last hotel I stayed with an actual 13th floor! Fun! My room had a small balcony which was nice but did not have chairs. It is as I found out, just a place where others go to smoke as it wafted up and around me into my room from other guests. Airport noise was minimal except when large (767, 777, 747) planes took off on the runway next to the hotel. They have removed the Executive Lounge in lieu of a free appetizer in the bar for Gold and Diamond members. The newly renovated room was nice and up to Hilton standards. They tried to add some boutique flair with the tower light and the bathroom was very nice with a backlit mirror that is very appealing. Normally I prefer a shower head with multiple settings but found their large rain (photo attached) head very nice with good water pressure. The desk lamps were cute but completely non-practical. See the photos - the 'genie bottle' style makes it absolutely impossible to plug in anything with a larger plug such as a cell phone. Business travelers NEED power for laptops, notepads, phones and other accessories. Apparently the designer uses none of these things! The TV was a nice, large unit as I would expect in any newly stocked room today. The pool was very nice and had one of the smoothest floors in a cement pool I have encountered. A nice thing. The hottub while small was just what I needed after a long run on the treadmill. Speaking of the fitness center, they have just 3 treadmills and therefore have been programmed to only allow a 30 minute session. They could probably squeeze in more and take that away. There was one recumbent bike, 2 ellipticals and 2 weight benches with dumbells. Fitballs were also available. A nice touch on the Precor machines is the TV complete with regualr headphones (disposable pads available). I like this as I despise ear buds when I am running and usually forget my cheap headphones at home. I will NOT use my good Bose when running. Lastly, the breakfast. As a perpetual Diamond member, the continental portion of their breakfast buffet is free. It was really good but was dissapointed that they did not open until 6:30. Most hotels open at 6 so you can still catch early flights. My flight was at 8 and I was pushing it by eating at 6:30. They saw me waiting from 6:15 but did not even bother to ask me any questions or acknowledge me standing there even though the buffet was 99% stocked already. Overall, a nice property. It has that larger property/big pool/pool bar throwback resort feel despite being an airport hotel.

The grounds are really pretty, including a boardwalk to a gazebo on the lagoon. There is very nice landscaping outside and many nice plants inside this hotel. It is not a cookie cutter hotel like some of the chains. The property has some unique and desirable features. My criticisms would or could include 1. Charge for internet service @$12.95 and if you don't pay, it blocks your i-phone access to internet; in my case since I am a Hilton member, I did not have to pay. 2. The room was $94 and $15 for parking. (Another $13 in taxes, state, local etc). I didn't like paying $15 for parking. Breakfast would not have been included, but it was for me because I am a Hilton Gold Card member. However, only the continental part of the buffet; I was not allowed to have the hot items with the coupon provided. My total bill for the hotel, parking, and taxes was $122.38 and that was with AAA discount and for one person. Probably one of the better rates, especially since it included internet and continental breakfast. In addition, I will get Hilton Honors points for the stay.

The TV was not working (they told me it would be half an hour, it never worked before we went to sleep) and the Kid's hamburger was only $5.00, plus a $5.00 delivery fee + 22% room charge. We had no option but to do this as my son was hungry and we had a 6:40 flight the next morning. Took 40 minutes, now it's nearly 10:30, and the hamburger was awful. The next morning they missed the wakeup call, it was a good thing I had put something into my iphone to wake me up. BOTTOM LINE: This is an AWFUL hotel, and that is from a person who spends about 60+ nights per year (many in Hilton's) in hotels. If you have a family don't stay here, the hotel in the airport is similarly overpriced and awful, but at least you can be there in 10 minutes and walk down to the departure check in area for McDonald's or something.

The beds are great and incredibly comfortable. I had no problems getting to sleep. I had a runway view (on request) but the noise was no problem. I used the fitness facilities/gym twice and although small it was well-equipped. The machines were new and it was very clean.

After reading some reviews I was not expecting a lot but it was close to the airport and our plane arrived late at night. After arriving at the airport at 11:00pm we exited to the upper level roadway and waited no more than 5 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. In a quick and comfortable 10 minute ride we arrived at the hotel. The driver called for another shuttle for some people that could not fit on the bus. Location. The hotel is on the end of a peninsula surrounded by a quiet lagoon. The water separates the hotel from the runway/freeway and the planes takeoff and land often, so if you want a really quiet spot this isn't it. However it really isn't that loud for a airport hotel and the grounds are lush and well maintained and do a lot to absorb any noise. The surroundings were safe with the hotel being in a quiet office/hotel area. Check-in was quick and effecient after an initial wait as the lone front desk person dealt with a group that had gotten dropped off at the wrong Hilton.(they were supposed to be in Ft Lauderdale....) We received a 14th floor room as requested at booking and were on our way in minutes. The room was spacious with a view out the front of the hotel to the lagoon.The windows also overlooked the end of the runway but the room was well insulated. I was prepared for the room to be a throw back from the eighties and I wasn't let down. The TV and furniture were very dated and I was surprised Hilton hadn't updated the room to their normal standard. However,everything was very clean and well kept, but the hotel in general seemed like it dropped \"brand new\" from the 80's into 2009. Oh well, the beds were very comfy and the bath amenities and towels were great. The Lobby, halls, elevators and downstairs were well kept but dated. We didn't eat at the buffet but it looked all right. The property, as said before, was well kept with a nice pool, outdoor bar and lots of loungers. There's a nice walkway to a gazebo with a resident iguana who didin't seem to care about posing pictures. Transportation to the cruise terminal is $25 by taxi or a shuttle is $12/person booked through the bellman. Overall a great airport hotel for a few nights but by no means luxury or a 4 star.

I have to say that our stay at the Fairfield Inn in Key West was much more satisfactory than our stay at the supposedly more upscale Hilton. I'm not sure if it is because we had a gift certificate or just the luck of the draw. We had a junior suite, on the executive floor, which was a nice perk (executive lounge provides complimentary snacks, beverages, and internet access) . However, just outside our room was the intake for the heating/cooling system and there was a constant loud hum that was clearly audible from inside the room. In addition to that, the elevator shaft was directly behind the headboard to our bed. With EACH time the elevator went up or down, everywhere in our building, we could hear the WHOOSH , followed by the squeak of the cables. I lay awake counting, and estimated it at every 20-30 seconds; no kidding. Besides that, the vents for the air conditioner are positioned pointing directly at the head of the bed. There is no way to re-direct the vent or escape the air (unless, I guess, you slept with your head at the foot of the bed... but that brings its own problems!) We discovered all this late at night as we were getting ready to go to bed. We also discovered a pillow covered in someone else's makeup and that we had no washrags. Again, it was late and we were tired. I just left a note for the housekeeper the next AM to please change the pillowcase and leave washrags, which she did. Unfortunately, she didn't leave more coffee, so we had to call for that the next morning. The room itself seemed clean enough (with the exception of the one pillowcase). I have seen a mention in another review of being able to hear your neighbors' noise, and I'll have to say that I did hear their phone quite clearly ringing. Other than that, they must have been pretty quiet people. Even with its proximity to the airport, I didn't hear airplane noise. We had the breakfast buffet each morning. The selections were quite good, and there is a cooked-to order omelet/egg station which offers pancakes or waffles as well. As in other Hiltons, expect to pay $22 for breakfast. We were made to feel at checkout as though putting up with the noise was all our fault; and I suppose if we'd felt like packing up everything at 11PM and moving, we could have moved to a quieter room. I would suggest instead that the hotel see what it could do to mitigate the noise issues in that room! The hotel itself is very nice overall and I'm sure that not all the rooms have the noise issues we faced. Parking is $15/day for self parking and seemed to be plentiful and easy to get in and out with your room key.

We were originally booked to stay the last three nights of our holiday at a nearby ( not Homewood) suites hotel, however after a very disappointing stay at that hotel a week earlier (despite its excellent tripadvisor rating), it was with some trepidation that we switched to the Hilton (it was the only hotel I could find in a hurry with availability). I had read some of the poor reviews here but figured it could not get much worse than our experience at the the nearby suites hotel. Maybe I was lucky because I got the Hilton Honors floor (Floor 11 as far as I can remember?), but our room was very comfortable, clean and functioning, no smells or mustiness. We did opt to pay $20 a night extra for a balcony room ( can be selected by booking on hilton.com), The balcony is a bit small with no furniture but excellent for smokers ( my wife is one unfortunately!). We had a very pleasnat view over the lagoon on one side and Miami Airport on the other ( great fun if you enjoy an occasional bit of plane spotting, :-) ), and when the doors windows are closed , minimal noise from the airport ( the airport stops at night anyway, so no real worries about noise). My advice would be to go for the balcony rooms, based on the hotel layout, I figure they are all corner rooms so possibly a bit larger and with more windows. Even after paying $20 extra a night at the hilton over the other suites hotel the rate was still $30 a night cheaper, and the hilton is a full service hotel, Just beware you will get stung with $10 a night for parking (\"swings and roundabouts\") at the Hilton About the hotel staff, and reports of rudeness on earlier reviews, We made a few front desk queries and used the reataurant one morning for breakfast, everyone was very pleasnt and helpful, The security guys at the hotel entrance were also very friendly.

Maybe this made all the difference. The room was beautiful. The beds were wonderful. The food in the Executive Club was great - and since we stayed during the Olympics, many people were popping in and out of the Club to watch Michael Phelps. Very pleasant, relaxing experience. The weekend staff, too, was wonderful. Check-in was a breeze at the HHonors dedicated desk. The bellmen and concierge staff were friendly and helpful. I had a fun conversation with the shuttle driver as I rode from the hotel over to the airport on Sat. night to meet my daughter's flight. Returning on the shuttle, however, was more problematic. Two or three shuttle vans passed us by because they had filled beyond capacity at the International terminal and had no room for the domestic passengers waiting. Eventually, the hotel sent a shuttle just for us and for the other family who had been waiting with us for quite some time. Sunday, we decided to go to the pool early to catch some sun before the imminent arrival of Tropical Storm Fay. Again, loved the pool...AND the very large(!) iguana who twice visited the pool deck during our stay and seemed quite at home.

I went out to the fitness center, which is located in its own pleasant little building next to the pool and is open 24 hours. The fitness center is well equipped with a set of free weights, and multiple late-model treadmills and stairmasters, each with its own small flat-screen TV and headphones so everyone can watch what they want without bothering anyone else. The pool area, fitness center, and lobby all look fine. The major downside of this hotel, as numerous other reviewers have noted, is the proximity to the airport. Even though the place is clearly heavily soundproofed, you can clearly hear a distant roar every ten minutes (and sometimes the building shakes). I am a very deep sleeper so I don't mind, but any light sleepers would be well advised to avoid this place. The second big downside is the expensive parking. Because there is no street parking on Blue Lagoon Drive, and all the other parking lots nearby are secured private lots for various corporate office buildings, you have no choice but to pay $10 per day to park in the Hilton's lot. At least they let registered guests go in and out so it's not like you're trapped. As several people have noted, there are no major restaurants nearby (Burger King headquarters is down the street but there's no Burger King to go with it) so you will have to drive a distance if you want something other than room service or the hotel restaurant. Finally, although well-maintained, the hotel is beginning to look dated and in need of a renovation. This is especially obvious in the elevator lobbies and elevators; the control panels both in the lobbies and the elevators are clearly quite battered and need to be replaced. The elevators are also noisy and cranky.

In spite of that, the major issue of the hotel is the noise due to the airport. The bedroom was really big and clean. I couldn't get the curtains to blackout completely, and the sun waked us up daily. Air conditioning was also somehow noisy (seemed quite old). Bathroom was ok, even it was starting to look old.

The pool is great for all the family. There is a workout gym with cardio equipment and machine weights ( alas no free weights) We had the Sunday Brunch in the Coral Cafe at $25.95 per person. It is worth the price if you bring a healthy appetite. I find the regular menu a little limited in choices, but the prices are pretty good for hotel fare, as well as tasty.

However, as it turns out I should have probably gone with my first instinct and booked a Sheraton instead. The hotel itself was not bad. It was an older building and in need of some updating but still nice. Upon arriving we had the option of valet parking our vehicle or self parking it but both cost money so we valeted it for the added convenience. The valet person did not speak English but he tried to be helpful. The same was true for many of the employees here. I understand this is Miami, but it is stil lteh USA and I think that if you are in the service industry here you should speak the language! It would be different if I went to Spain and the people spoke Spanish. Anyway...check in was pretty simple and the bellman was nice. He escorted us to our room, we had reserved a king executive room, and we got settled. The room was nice. a closter, a vanity area, a bathroom with a tub, a table and chairs, and a bed that was not anywhere near being a king. Now I requested a king bed because my husband is 6'6\" and has a bad back. This bed may have been a queen but I really think it was a double. His legs were hanging off the end of the bed and the mattress was very lumpy. I have a great back and am only 5'5\" and I felt cramped and uncomfortable i nthis bed. So, I spoke to someone at the front desk about this and I was told that all of the \"king\" beds at this hotel were that size so I had no options. We thought it would be okay since it was only 3 nights but by the last night my husband was almost crippled from back pain. We wanted to go to dinner someplace on teh first night and so once again we asked a few employees directions and of course they did not speak English well enough to help us so we were on our own. Luckily we found where we were looking for after a few wrong turns. No harm done. The hotel has a decent gym that we utilized a couple of times. weight machines, ellipticles, treadmills, bikes... That was a nice feature. I also used the pool one day. It is ia decent sized pool but I think it should have been cleaner. There were tons of bugs floating around that should have been dealt with. I was not the only one that felt this way as I heard several other pool-goers voice the same opinion while I was out there. It was very hot out and I realized that I forgot my sunscreen so I asked the pool bartender if he knew where I could get some sunscreen and he sent me to the hotel gift shop next about 50 steps away. I walked in to the timy room and looked for sunscreen. The ladies working there were busy chatting with one another to bother seeing if I needed any help. After looking around for about 10 minutes I found spf 3 and it cost something like $18! What is the point?! Anyway, I finally interrupted their conversation and asked if they had anything a bit stronger and they said \"no\" and resumed their conversation. Luckily, I had a sample packet of bullfrog hidden in my purse that I had forgotten about so I used that. Otherwise I would have ben toasted. I ordered a drink and a salad from the pool bar during my pool excursion. The service here was less than impressive. However, I think part of this was due to the fact that they were understaffed here. There was one bartender and he had to help everyone at he pool plus he had to keep running inside to pick up the food orders so her would be gone for 10 minutes at a time leaving the bar unattended and the customers waiting. Then, when he got back he was not very attentive either. All I had was a Pepsi and I had to ask him for a refill each time even though he looked right at my glass and could clearly see that it was empty. The salad was not bad. I got room service one day. The service was quick and the food was ok, nothing impressive though. We also ate at the hotel restaurant a couple of times. service here was pretty good, especially at breakfast. I liked the fact that they had fresh squeezed OJ. I thin kthat every restaurnat in the state of Florida should have fresh Squeezed citrus juices. It is Florida for crying out loud! Our service at dinner was not as good and the restaurant wa not that packed either. It was much busier at breakfast. Check out was easy too.

As a frequent business and leisure traveler, I noticed several issues which set this property apart from others in a negative way mostly related to the service and staff. I was not offered assistance with my bags when entering the hotel, despite trying to juggle 3 bags. I was not greeted in a friendly manner, but rather an expressionless reception with just the basic information communicated. The room was average and clean. I did have access to the Executive lounge which was OK and had both hot and cold finger foods available for happy hour (note: they charge $3.50 for wine/beer/cocktails, other beverages are free). The pool area was OK, but filled with bored looking folks just wishing to be somewhere else. The pool bartender oscillated somewhere between curt and proactively rude. The concierge was clueless when it came to asking about the best way to the cruise terminal. I had to flag down someone to hold my bags past check-out and then the process of getting the bags to a cab was an exercise in patience for the incompetence and rudeness demonstrated by the bell hops. The service was simply unacceptable and lousy, not a single friendly gesture among the staff apart from the young woman staffing the Executive lounge who was not necessarily friendly rather just unoffensive. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone unless it's the only one in town and you need to be by the airport and someone else is footing the bill; otherwise you'll be disappointed by the lack of caliber of service you would expect at a Hilton property.

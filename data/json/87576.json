This is an older building which seems to not have been updated for quite a while. The front desk was helpful in terms of addressing our concerns. Our first room was basic however it wreaked of cigarette smoke. Though the rooms are non-smoking it seems all the years of smoking are now embedded in the walls, ceiling, and carpet. We asked for another room which they did find for us. We got a slightly larger room with a kitchenette. The bathroom was nice and large since we got a handicap accessible room (this was good for my aunt). Though basic it was a nice step up from the first room. The room contained 2 full sized beds which were OK, nothing special about them. Though the room was large it was facing the street so it was noisy at night till about 1am or so. after that it was OK. The AC was old and noisy so it did help drown out some of the noise but of you don't want any noise this may not be the place for you. I wold say around a 2 star hotel and that incudes the location as a plus. It is situated between the happenings of Magnificent Mile and the large number of museums towards the southern end of town.

When we called the front desk, they told us that they turn the heat on at 6pm or 7pm. It was in the upper 60's in our room during the day. This is not the hotel to hang out in in the daytime.

We left the room for few hours to go eat came back about 12:30am to go to bed. Well when my husband was climbing into bed he noticed a small bug in the bed he called for me and sure enough a bed bug!!!!

I immediately called the front desk the desk employee sent up security to come check it out. They said they would upgrade us to a suite. But my sister-in-law checked her bed also at the same time and the same creepy crawlies were in her room as well!!! We then went down to the desk employe and said we wanted our money back but since our reservations were through Expedia they could not until we spoke with them. So we got them on the phone and they called this said desk employee he hung up on the Expedia employee!!! The most awful customer service I have ever seen! The desk employee never seemed concerned about the situation was more angry that we disturbed him reading his book! So at one in the morning we had to pack up our things which took no more than 5 minutes and started calling other hotels in the area. Luckily we found one or else our only other option was sleeping in our car because we were not sleeping there! We were finally refunded our money sometime late afternoon the next day after Expedia repeatedly calling the hotel to speak with the manager... will never go back!

We booked this hotel knowing how poorly it was rated in tripadvisor; we were looking for a reasonably-priced downtown hotel for just one night. I have to admit that it is quite well located, just a block or so from Michigan Avenue. And, at around $150 per night, it was reasonably priced. Given the lousy reviews, we knew not to expect the Taj Mahal, but we were not really prepared for what we found. We had plenty of time to enjoy the amenities of the lobby - there were none - while the front desk staff dealt with phone calls instead of servicing the check-in line. They did make some effort to bring the great outdoors inside, in the form of tons of little leaves all over the lobby floor; I was thinking that they might want to put out a collection jar so as to buy a vacuum. We were ultimately given our room keys and proceeded to the seventh floor, via an elevator that had a good-sized pool of vomit on the floor. Our rooms were right next to one another. One room key worked fine, but the other just caused red/green flickering lights on the key reader. As it turns out, this means that the door is bolted from the inside, i.e., ALREADY OCCUPIED. It took two trips to the lobby, and the eventual aid of a security guard, to figure this out, but that was the bottom line: they gave my brother a room that was already occupied. Another trip to the lobby, and he was finally given a room of his very own. The cells, er, rooms, were fairly small and showed signs of extreme old age (fair enough, for the price). I found them rather depressing. The bed was among the worst I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept in; I am wondering if the mattress somehow predated the hotel. I had a nice view of the elevated train line, and the soundtrack to go with it. I used the heater/fan to mask some of the noise; ear plugs took care of the rest. There was no Kleenex in the room, so if you tend to travel with your nose, you might want to bring your own supply of Kleenex. The hot water worked fine in my bathroom, but my brother's bathroom could muster only a trickle. There were people hanging out in the halls at night, which seemed kind of weird, but I don't know whether that was typical. In addition, the room doors did not close on their own, which seemed a bit odd. The overall feeling of the place was not one of safety. The three tiny elevators were not nearly sufficient, especially during peak times, like 8 or 9 a.m., when everyone was heading out for the day. We had breakfast in the restaurant off the lobby; it was actually just fine, which is to say, it appeared to be unassociated with the Travelodge itself. The bellman did have the ability to check your bags for you, and could even give you claim tickets for them. We were amused and a bit concerned to find that he didn't seem to check the claim ticket numbers when giving back bags. One lady asked for hers, which she described as a pink bag with a red ribbon on it; the bellman brought out a maroon bag, sans ribbon, for her consideration, but I guess she was kind of attached to her own luggage.

The was pressure was much improved but hot water was still hard to come by. I am not telling you not to stay at this hotel. It is very resonably priced and has a great location-steps off Michigan Avenue. I am telling you that there is a reason it is so much less that the neighboring hotels. You get what you pay for.

We were shopping for a hotel that was convenient to the museums, theaters, Grant Park and transportation. This location seemed to be perfect. We run a tour business and we book groups year-round and Chicago seems to always be a favorite of our clients. Upon check-in, we were greeted by a man at the front desk who was helpful and attentive as we arrived a little early. The bell captain was friendly and escorted us to our room. The room seemed nice enough for our needs. We had lunch at the restaurant which was actually better than we expected. At this point, we thought that we had found the perfect hotel. The next morning, we went to the front desk to let the agent know how pleased we were with the property. There was a woman behind the front desk with a very heavy accent who practically ignored our presence. She seemed more interested in chatting away and flirting up a storm with the bell captain. My first thought was that it was a good thing that there was a desk separating them or she may have been sitting on his lap. When we finally did get her attention, we asked her a question and she was utterly rude. It was as though we were imposing on her little tryst. In my opinion, her actions were highly unprofessional and not what I would expect to see at the front desk of a hotel. When we got back from shopping, we went to the front desk to ask about restaurants in the area. The agent at the desk in the evening was helpful and gave us some options. The next morning, when we were coming out of the elevator we were greeted by the bell captain and went to the restaurant for breakfast. When we walked out of the restaurant, the same woman as the previous morning was there AGAIN chatting up the bell captain. We stopped to ask him a question and while he was very gracious and helpful, she gave us a glare that could have killed. At that point, my mind had been made up. We would not be giving this hotel our business. On a positive note, our room attendant was quite friendly and seemed to be very conscientious about her work. When we checked out the same man who checked us in was at the front desk and asked how our stay was and seemed to be genuinely interested. I wanted to tell him about our good and bad experiences, but I thought better of it and just told him that everything had been fine. The bell captain helped us with our bags to the cab and again was very gracious.

Both restaurants were reasonably priced and the food was very good. Our room had a kitchenette which was an unexpected surprise. The bathroom was huge! It was lacking on counter space to store stuff, but had a full length mirror and another closet. We had a safe in the closet to store valuables. It did need fresh batteries to get it to work. A call to the front desk and someone came and fixed it within 5 minutes. The maintenance man was also very knowledgeable about the city and told us which buses to take to get to certain attractions. His advice was spot on! The room itself was very large and had a couch, dresser, and a desk with a nice office chair.

We felt very safe in the location. We enjoyed our walks to Grant Park, Buckingham Fountian (which took our breath away with it's beauty) and Michigan Ave. all within a one to two block area. This is a budget friendly hotel that is clean, and safe-no extras. If you are ok with that, this is the place for you. The hotel had booked us in the wrong room. We had a print out of the agreement with us. We never had to give it to them, as they gave us a free upgrade that was better then what we had hoped for as soon as we alerted them of their mistake. We booked this hotel not expecting much as it was the lowest priced hotel we could find after days of trying to find something cheap for our family in a safe area. The room was clean. It looks dated (you would not post facebook photos from the room) but we didnt care. The bathroom was large, clean and updated. We did not find a blow dryer or iron in the room-but had expected that for the price. We paid $129.00 a night for three nights. We were on the top floor (12) and from our window we had a great view of the elevated red line. This was awesome for us as we traveled with my eight year old boy, who loved to just watch it go by. For anyone else... the noise has the potential to disturb your sleep if you are a light sleeper. The hotel provides free WiFi. The housekeeper was on our floor for what seemed like hours a day. She always had her cart stocked with supplies. We didn't mind walking down a hall for extra supplies, instead of waiting until she got to our room. She keep to herself, but was friendly when providing service. When I read reviews all I heard about was how slow the elevators were. What the issue is - in the morning a lot of people are using the elevators, each of the three elevators only holds seven people-therefor, people have to wait. I say big deal...allow yourself an extra 5 minutes in the morning to save a hundred dollars a night. This is a non-smoking hotel. There is a standing area in the front that is provided for the smokers. It's nice in the morning as the sun is facing the smoking area and it's fun area to people watch. I always came across appropriate, well behaved people in the area of this hotel. The hotel seemed to be filled with families, people who were there for out of town meetings, couples both gay and straight, and people who were there for special events in the area-games and concerts. Every staff member we came across smiled when we smiled at them. The staff does not offer information or initiate conversation. When asked they know so much about the city-the lady at the desk helped to plan our out trip by bus! This was after I told her we figured out the day trip we wanted to take by the Hide Park area of Chicago would cost a total of sixty dollars round trip by taxi! She went as far as giving us a print out. I made sure to talk to the staff during the non-busy times to get additional information and attention from them. There is a diner/grill type cafe to eat at right off the lobby. The cafe also sells snacks to take on your adventures. The guy at the front counter is very pleasent there too. The cafe is mostly open for breakfast/lunch hours. If you need a fast cheap meal you can also go right across the street. You will find a Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robins, KFC/Pizza Hut and a Sub Way sandwhich shop. Taxi service is easy to find in front of the hotel. The longest we waited was about four minutes. The only service I can think of that would have made this budget friendly hotel better is... The hotel could have a sign or some form of written communication alerting it's customers of all the great site seeing locations that are so near by. If you have never been to a big city before Chicago can be very overwhelming.

Not only furniture and decor, but basics. In our first room, when I turned on the sinks hot water some brown sludge came up, momentarily. The blinds were ripped and had holes. Both my friend and I had incessant trouble with the magnetic keys opening out room door. (Staff said don't store them close to a cellphone or iPod is would demagnetize them.... ya, right!). The final straw in that room was that the door would simply not lock when leaving! We requested a room change at that point. (We were no frills travelling but there are basic essentials that must be met!) - infrastructure: in the \"new\" or second room, there was low water pressure and hardly hot water. The same room key problem remained with that roomlock too, however, at least it locked. The elevator was VERY slow. - service: given the above we requested a reduction in room price. They were resistant, although I am quite sure that these issues and complaints repeat with every second visitor. Eventually we got 25% off (they originally suggested 10%). As mentioned, I do feel sorry for the staff. With a building like this, you are in a losing battle. It needs a complete overhaul.

Let's be honest; this is a discount hotel not the Marriott. I was in Chicago for 5 days to do a job and I was expecting a real dump.

But you won't find anything noticeably cheaper than the Travel Lodge unless you stay at the hostel about a block away. It was easy walking distance to the subway red line, even for an old man with moderate gout. Hell, I could throw a snowball that far in my day. The neighborhood felt safe to me with many elderly folks and college aged girls walking around alone even after 10:00 pm. It was 5 or 10 minutes to the center of Chicago where Michigan Ave crosses the Wacker river. Fast food was convenient with Dunkin Donuts, Subway, KFC, Pizza hut across the street and many more expensive eateries and watering holes in the neighborhood. The staff was courteous and helpful. Not many people were there and it was quiet. No mammalian, insect, avian, or fungal pests were observed. The sheets were clean, the room stayed warm in winter time, the electricity worked, the toilets flushed, hot water came out of the shower. Several clean towels along with small samples of soap, shampoo and lotion along with paper, pens, a phone book and a Bible were provided. The phone worked for calls coming ina nd I did not make any calls. I did not use the safe, coffee machine, TV, or iron. The place was dated and had been partially remodeled a few times giving it sort of an avande gros or tacky look depending on your tastes. A combination of the Thai restaraunt on the first flooor, strong cleaning chemicals and nearby Lake Michigan gave the hotel a rather unusual odor, but not unpleasant to me.

Was tired after an international flight, so was sleeping in the lobby on a chair with my luggage as a foot rest. The clerk Ken, was absolutely the worst customer service person I've ever come accross in my life. Not only was he extremely rude and cold, but believe it or not threatning as well. For example, I'd put my pen up, to sign in at check in.....he indicated 'Put that pen down sir, I'll tell you when it's time to sign', or something like that. Another guest was waiting with me, so when after 90 minutes we were called in to finally check-in , this person excitedly gesitculated at me to join him at check-in . Ken asked him if if I was with him, and when this guest said no, he was told to mind his own business. I could go on and on. The room was misereably small, and the coffee machine so old, that all the water accumulated in the filterr basket, and I nearly got scalded. The windows were old and and actually stuffed with sponge to keep the cold air out. The only saving grace was housekeeping, that I have to say. The hotel is near an Elevated Station, and there is constant noise of trains braking towards the station approach. Don't let the Michigan Avenue proximity fool you ; It is 'South Michigan', rather than North, and a very old, rundown area. The hotel reflects the same. I'd called head office, to lodge a complaint, but as expected it was all lip service,and no calls (around 5 of them) returned. If they say 'All complaints are taken seriously' it is an obvious lie. Calls to the general manager were not returned as well.

My fault, not the hotel's, but it doesn't help. While the website advises that the hotel is \"close to Union Station\" it is in fact a full mile away. Check-in was awful; we arrived around noon and were allowed to store our bags until the 3pm check-in time, about which they were very strict: by 3pm, the lobby was filled with over 40 people who had arrived at various times during the afternoon but were not permitted to check in until exactly 3pm. The rooms have no irons or ironing boards; no mini bar; no microwave; things you'd get standard even at a much cheaper roadside location. Each room had a radiator and an air conditioning unit build into the window such that the window could not be opened; this became a problem during the night when the power in the room failed in the stifling heat. The desk clerk responded to my complaint that the circuits were overloaded and nothing could be done. That's probably true; the overhead light switch in the room sparked when I switched it! At one point during the day at least one of the elevators got stuck and a guest had to climb out. The free \"high-speed\" internet is so slow that a short video would take close to an hour to download. The shelf over the sink in our bathroom was broken, leaving absolutely no place to store toothbrushes, etc. Water pressure in the shower was poor (although we were on a high floor in this 12-storey building). We expected a complimentary continental breakfast, as their website advertised this, but when we got there, they told us they'd stopped doing that - although that's one of the features I'd paid for. The location is excellent - a block from the CTA Red Line and a block or so from Buckingham Fountain - in a very noisy but busy and safe area of the city. Despite the check-in fiasco and their inability to fix the power outages, the staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful. The \"fully equipped\" business center consisted of one computer and a non-functioning printer. This place was so much cheaper than anything else in the city, I should have realized it was too good to be true. I'd recommend it, because for the difference in price I'd volunteer to suffer.

In terms of the 'loop' it's located in the SouthEast corner! If you use the train from O'Hare it'll take about 45 mins, followed by a further 15 mins on foot. Going by road would probably be quicker. We booked the Travelodge Downtown because it was inexpensive (about \u00c2\u00a380 per night) and we intended to use it to sleep in and that's it! There's too much to do in Chicago in two days to spend our time in the hotel. I'll point out now, this is a downtown 2/3 star hotel and it operates and is furnished accordingly. If you want the luxuries associated with 4/5 star hotels, you'll need to book a 4/5 star hotel and pay a 4/5 star price. Nevertheless, the room and remainder of the hotel were clean and comfortable. One of the elevators was broken with no idea as to when it will be fixed, but there's still 2 other elevators to use and the staircase was working fine. The complimentary breakfast included as part of the deal was served from a diner, which is an adjoining building. In fact you don't even have to walk outside to access it. The food was pretty much the same as you'd be served in most downtown cafe/diners, nothing special. We found the staff to be very helpful: offering advice on what to do in the local area and they often had a flier that will get you a discount for that activity. In sum, you get what you pay for - a 2/3 star downtown hotel, but it is clean and comfortable with helpful staff. I suppose it depends on what you want out of the hotel: If you want a modern decor, up-market hotel with 4 star amenities, you need to look elsewhere.

I did not hear a single sound from anyone in the hall or in the other rooms, nothing. The hotel is old and solidly built so the sound doesn't pass through the walls like newer Motel 6 type places. Some people might not like the \"whoosh\" of the El train but I liked it, it was like a white noise that subdued any other noises. Really, seriously, the sound of the train was no big deal, it was fine. The good thing about this place is that you can call the hotel directly in Chicago; you don't need to deal with the national reservations call center. I called the hotel and asked for a discount and they dropped the price of the room down to $67 dollars per night. Parking is $26 per night, the only cheaper parking downtown is $24 so the price for parking is great, and you can take your car in and out of the lot as much as you need to for no extra fee. And another hugely important reason that I chose this hotel was because there is no fee to change or cancel your reservations typically up to 4pm on the day of the reservation. You don't get locked into the rate like places like Hotwire or Orbitz or whatever.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAdequate accomodations\u201d", "Author": "lindacul", "ReviewID": "UR37360945", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel while in town for Lollopalooza.

The elevators were sooooo slow. I know the hotel was sold out with festival goers, but the wait time for the elvators was painful. We were on the top floor and we could never get an elevator. In fact, when we were checking out we waited so long I called the front desk and asked for someone to come get us in the service elevator. They were kind enough to come get us--and we beat the full elevator that had stopped at our floor before we even called! In conclusion, you get what you pay for.

The main thing we were hoping was that the hotel would be CLEAN and we would feel safe. The outside, lobby, elevators, and hallways were all clean. Everyone who worked there and who were staying there were very friendly. Most other patrons of the hotel are young budget travelers like us. We were on the 6th floor, room 605 I think. Our room was HUGE. We had two double beds, which were across from each other in the long room. Two windows, a TV, an upholstered chair and desk, even a kitchenette! We never used it but it appeared very clean. Our bathroom was spotless! We had plenty of clean towels and soaps etc. The bathroom actually seemed like it may have been updated recently. The hotel smelled like a hotel but it wasn't a noticeable stench or anything. The carpets didn't appear stained or dirty (though I did wear my shoes in the room as a precaution), nor did the blankets or the walls. The room had two large closets, one with a safe, which I would recommend using if you were planning on leaving anything important in the room. Overall we felt the experience was just fine! I've stayed the night in friends apartments that were WAY nastier than this place. I will say that I probably wouldn't have stayed in this hotel alone as a young woman, but our group of three women felt perfectly fine together in this hotel as a group. One bit of advice: If you are a light sleeper, take a sleeping pill or ear plugs because the elevated train is catty corner from the hotel, and there were a few car alarms going off in the night.

I would not recommend this hotel if you have any allergies, especially to dust. My room really could have used a thorough cleaning, but it was livable for one night. I did not have any bed bug issues, so that was good. The bathroom smelled of stagnent water, which I believe was the shower curtain. The tub was REALLY deep.

I won't complain about the dirty carpets and leftover tissues but about the security in this hotel. This hotel has NONE!! When we came back to the hotel the evening of April 12 from a day of touring the city, we saw that there was no complimentary water so we went down to 711 to buy some. Since it was already 10pm, we thought it would be safe to leave my envelope containing my credit cards, passport, some money and plane ticket in the night stand's drawer than carry it with us outside and we would be gone for only a little while. We were out for about 45 minutes. When we went out of the room, I noticed there were young people outside our room in the corridor hanging out. I thought they were tourists like us. Now I am beginning to think otherwise. The next day, we checked out at 11 am. Before we left I checked the drawer but only the bible was there so I thought my companion already retrieved the envelope because she was the one packing our things. I was busy working on my laptop. When we reached Cleveland, we found out that the envolope was missing and my friend said she did not take it out of the drawer and she thought I took because I was working on the table. We called the hotel immediately but the front desk said we had to wait until 8 am to be able to speak to the housekeeping or to check the room because only himself and the doorman are in the hotel. There were no emergency number to reach anyone who could answer our questions. When asked if somebody checked-in after we checked-out, he said yes. The next morning when we called again, the day staff said nobody used the room after we checked out and they will check out the room and call us back. They called us back once to say they did not find anything but I said it should be there as we are very sure and where else would it go and there's money and credit cards in it. Hearing there were money there, he said they will investigate and call us back. They never called us back again and we made several calls, got connected to the manager's office and was answered by machines. So we drove back to Chicago early the next day from Cleveland for 6 hours. We looked for the manager and he met us in the lobby and he was very rude and unaccommodating. He would not even listen and entertain the possibility that my valuables have been stolen from the room. The first thing he said when he met us is that we are free to file a police report about the loss. He ordered my brother in law to leave when he suggested the valuables might have been stolen. He only wanted to believe that we misplaced it somewhere. But we are very sure that we did not. I thought my brother in law and the manager would end up in a fight because the manager was short of pushing my brother in law out because he suggested that my valuables could have been stolen. My sister and I had to stand between the two of them while my brother in law was telling the manager, \" Don't you lay your hands on me!\" Seeing the hostilty, we left. We did not come for a confrontation but with a hope of finding even just my passport so I can fly back to the philippines the next day. We spent the rest of the day at the Consulate to secure Travel documents to facilitate my travel without a passport. So fellow travelers, if you don't want any trouble, STAY AWAY from this hotel!!! There are other hotels with relatively the same price but much cleaner and safer than Travelodge. The hotel has no security at all! They have no security cameras in corridor nor staff in the lobby at night other than the doorman and 1 receptionist. if your room is flooding at night, you'll have to wait until the next morning before somebody fix it, if they will.

The passing trains create considerable noise, and as they run from 05:00 AM to 01:00 AM, earplugs are a necessity for a good night's sleep. It's an old building. The doors jam and the locks are not in good condition. I had to jiggle the front and bathroom door to get them open and shut.

Most of the hotels in this area were extremely expensive and not affordable, except for the Travelodge Downtown Hotel. It is located just two blocks from Grant Park and just one block from the Chicago Transit Authority Red Line stop. I found their best rate online for AAA and AARP discounts, then called them and asked them if they could do better. They could -- they gave me 15% off the AARP rate! If you fly into O'Hare Airport, you take the CTA Blue Line train to the Jackson stop, then walk three blocks east to Wabash Street and, under the elevated train tracks overhead, walk another three blocks south to Harrison Street. The Travelodge is located at the southeast corner of Wabash and Harrison Streets. There is parking available in a parking garage behind the hotel which costs about $29 per day with the hotel discount, or you can park across the street in an uncovered private parking lot for $13 per day. The hotel is not the sort of hotel a business traveler would use, from what I saw of its amenities but it is perfect for budget travelers. A real plus for me is that it offers free wi-fi that you can access from your room. The rooms are drab, but the linens and towels, etc. seemed to be in good shape, although not of a high quality. A negative is that the rooms are VERY NOISY from outside noise. The hotel fronts the street and the back of it which has a t-shape either faces the parking garage or a busy alley that runs behind other big hotels and restaurants. Dump trucks went through the alley all night long emptying out dumpsters -- the noise echoed through the alley and literally made the room vibrate inside. I bought earplugs for the second night and the dumpsters being emptied still woke me up -- I could feel the concussion through my pillow! That was a real negative for me. The rooms have color TVs with local channels and HBO and Showtime for free, and some PPV channels -- it was about a 19-inch. There are no desks in the rooms from which to write if you are here on business travel. There is an ATM machine in the lobby. There is a Thai restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel and a small eat-in/takeout place on the other side of the hotel ground floor that opens at 6:30 AM is offers economical morning and afternoon meals. Subway and Pizza Hut were across the street and a 7-Eleven was two blocks away. The front desk clerk was somewhat grumpy when I checked in and a separate front desk clerk was harried and grumpy when I checked out, but the bell captain was very helpful when I asked for information on the best buses and subways to take to attractions. The rooms have free voicemail and if you need to receive a fax, the hotel does not charge to receive them, but they do charge to send them -- most hotels charge to receive them, so that was nice. The elevators all seemed to work (but don't look in the mirrors inside the elevators -- they were like carnival mirrors, everyone looks squat and wide in them). If I came back to Chicago on business, I would stay somewhere else (because my company would be paying) but if I came back myself on leisure, I would stay here again, except I would try to make sure I didn't get a room that faced the alley -- I think the rooms facing the street would have been quieter.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot bad really\u201d", "Author": "latinboy1976", "ReviewID": "UR18904472", "Content": "Ok, for anyone about to stay at this hotel you really need to lower your expectations.

With the suite you get a fridge, a microwave and a sink along with a living room type deal. I will admit though that it was nice to have the extra space. I found the room upon checking in to be clean, the pillows to be slightly better then most 2 star hotels and from what the mister says the bed was comfy. For him to say the bed is comfy he is telling the truth since he has a lot of back issues. For me well a bed is a bed, I can sleep on almost anything.

In addition, I could not figure out how to work the TV even after talking to the desk, and AGAIN, they sent up the \"security\" guy to help me.

Staying at the Travelodge turned out to be a very funny experience as the hotel has a strange Hopper feel. For instance, the personnel is helpful and polite, but everybody look soooo depressed; you can feel that those people hate their jobs and their lives. The hotel itself is very old, but clean. The whole decor is reminescent of a 1950's hotel, lot of gaudy carpeting everywhere. The room itself was OK. Unlike other reviews I read, the bathroom was just fine (but I have the feeling it may vary a lot from one room to the other). The furniture has seen better days. Lot of dents. The bed was uncomfortable at first, but then we quickly realized it had simply never been fliped. Once we did that, it was fine, it was in fact a good Serta mattress. And whoever did the last painting job inside the room should be fired as he did not bother protecting the furniture; the tv and bed had paint stains. The major problems are the very old windows, the close proximity to the elevated subway (see photo) and the antique air conditioninhg system, combined together, they make for a very noisy room (make sure to bring ear plugs as one other reviewer suggested - thanks for the tip by the way). But, on the other hand the insulation between rooms is great (all walls are concrete). There were kids on the next room but I never heard a noise (I have been to Hillton hotels where you could tell what TV program was playing next door). The view from the window is depressing (the train + a concrete parking ) but, I felt the location was perfect. I was one block away from Michigan avenue; and, I could walk to the lake and the museums. And if I wanted to go uptown I could take a bus on Michigan ave (there are buses every min - no kidding). We found the fast food restaurant very convenient. Once again it had a funny 50's feel. It is fast food all right, but we did not want to waist time in a restaurant, so it worked fine for us. One funny note: I found a good bottle of wine in downtown in Chicago, and I wanted to open it, but because of the new plane regulations I did have an opener with me. So I asked the concierge if he had one. He did have one but, explained, that because they got stolen all the time, I had to open my bottle on the spot in the main lobby. I thought the guy was joking; no, he was not. So I ended up opening my St Emilion in front of other guests. I laughed so much afterwards...... Overall, I am not sure I would go there again. I was in a good mood; and, I looked at the bright side of the whole thing thinking the experience was in tune with my love for Edward Hopper's work. I think next time I go to Chicago, I will go for a quieter hotel, possibly the Best Western which is close by. If I had to go again to the Travelodge, I would go for a double bed room; I took a peek, they are like small appartments with a kitchen sink, fridge and microwave, plus they are on the far side away from the subway. Otherwise, go for a room on the top floor, and don't hesitate to ask for naither room, if you are not happy.

The bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of hot water, and the towels were soft and clean. The hotel provided hand and body soap, shampoo, and body lotion. The TV worked well and had free HBO. The wireless internet worked great. (But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to call the front desk to get the access code). The AC worked just fine and the coffee maker was new. There is no hairdryer so you want to bring your own, and like all downtown hotels it is noise. The El train runs all night and it is loud. There were fire, police, and ambulance sirens goings at all hours of the night, and we heard the sanitation men picking up garbage at 4:00am. Such is life in a big city. You may want to use ear plugs, or like us, use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fan only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the AC to cover up the noise. We found that to work just fine. The halls were a bit narrow as all older hotels are, but they had recently been wall papered and they were well lighted. The ice machine had plenty of ice and we used it every day. We found the staff very friendly and checkout was quick and accurate. The price of the room was very reasonable for Chicago, but the $27 per day parking seemed high.

We booked via their website and were quoted just over $100+tax for a double room which we thought to be quite reasonable in a city such as Chicago. Arriving from Midway Airport on the train, the hotel is approximately 5 mins walk from the first station on the loop. It's a reasonable area, populated by a lot of students, so always felt very safe and the walk with luggage to the hotel was fine. When we arrived we were quite impressed by the reception area, although not modern, it was elegant and the staff were extremely friendly, especially with our credit card problems due to a cloning in Asia earlier in the trip. They did the extra security checks with no complaints and were very patient as it took about 30mins to sort out. As the room wasn't quite ready we checked our bags into storage and set off for a bite to eat. There are a number of fast food outlets just across the road including Dunkin Donuts. Once we were able to check in we headed up in the slowish lifts to our room. First problem, the double bed really was very small and with my Wife and I both being well over 6ft tall it was really no use to us. Therefore we rang down and asked to be moved to a king bed, which the staff sorted for us quickly, albeit for an extra $20 a night on top of the original price. The next room was better and slightly bigger with a good size king bed. We had no problems at all with the room, although I must admit the decor etc is a little dated. One problem that you might encounter is the banging pipes, this managed to keep my Wife awake for a while each night....not a lot you can do about that I guess. Location is great. Just down from the loop, plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the local vicinity. We used the underground to get north to places like the Magnificent Mile, it was very easy to use and very cheap. All in all we quite liked this hotel. Location is excellent but you must be aware it is an \"older\" type property and there are pitfalls to that such as the thin walls, banging pipes etc. The staff are spot on, the best Travelodge staff I have ever come across and they will help you with information and directions.

The air conditioning unit was fairly modern and worked fine, keeping the room cool. The room itself was kept clean apart from a few nooks and crannies which could've done with a bit of vacuuming. Our room looked out onto Harrison and Wabash and so the El Trains were quite noisy day and night, but we got used to it. The lifts worked fine although, as there were only 2 for public use, they were quite busy. There was a free copy of USA Today at reception although these were usually gone by about 0830-0900. The diner just off the lobby was always busy and we had a decent breakfast in there a couple of times. There's a Subway and a Dunkin Donuts across the street and a couple of Corner Cafes within a 5 minute walk.

Not an unreasonable request, I think. You would have thought I had just put some kind of slur on the receptionist's family, the way he reacted! After snapping at me that it was very safe, and that \"the police are round every 24 hrs or so\" (yeah, great....), I asked what time it got dark. Again, not unreasonable as I was on my own, and a woman. This resulted in further sighing and rolling of eyes, and he would not answer my question, just kept saying \"it's very safe, Ma'am\", which wasn't what I was asking!!! My room was barely cleaned the whole time I was there, and in fact on one of the days I got back to my room at 4pm to find that noone had actually cleaned it at all that day.

I did have a phone card, but when it ran out I was unable to top it up as I came from a different country. I then discovered that the hotel has barred their payphone in the lobby from making international calls. In dire straights and needing to speak to my husband, I used the room phone. Charges were stated in their room info as $3.50 \"plus charges\". I knew the cost would be bad and as a result only stayed on the phone for 3 mins 53 seconds. Upon checking out, they tried to charge me $105 for this call, which I flatly refused to pay. They refused to let me speak to the manager and an ugly argument developed, resulting in them dramatically reducing this charge, but it just made my blood BOIL! OK, whine over!

First, the staff was very helpful. We had 2 issues that were satisfactorily addressed within 30 minutes. The room was larger than most double rooms. There was a wet bar, fridge, and microwave that looked new. The bathroom was clean and updated. The beds were fine, though the sheets were worn. If this is important to you I would recommend you pack your own. The furnishings were budget and well used. The room was warm and generally very quiet. We did hear the radiator pipes once each night but none of us found the sound intrusive. We used the air conditioning to counter balance the room's excessive warmth. Access was the best part of this hotel. We could get anywhere via the Red Line or short walk. I want to say I would stay here again, but I probably won't. It's not that it was so bad, its just that I am used to much better accommodations. If I were a student or on a strict budget, I would certainly stay here.

We were within 3 blocks of the El station and 2 blocks from the Subway station. We bought a multi day pass at the hostel nearby which was good on all public transits- bus, subway and El so we could get anywhere we wanted for mega-cheap. We felt safe on the public transits and had fun trying to figure out how to get there. The concierge recommended a nearby pub for dinner and gave us a 10% off coupon. It is called the Exchequer Pub and we loved the food. We bumped into Will Ferrell on our way to the pub- he is filming a new movie downtown 2 blocks from the hotel. That was cool too.

Look, I am very tolerant person and hardly ever complain about where I stay, but this time I decided to say few words about Travelodge Hotel in downtown Chicago. We were on a red eye flight from Newark NJ to Chicago after all night spent at the airport. After arriving to the hotel at 7:30 am we were told that rooms are not ready and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be given to us until 3pm! We called a day ahead to make sure everything was ok with our early arrival and the clerk confirmed with us that our room would be ready when we get there. To our surprise it was not, and the clerk made it clear to us that he would not give us the room because they were not cleaned on time. How long does it take to clean a room....all day?? When requested a manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s help, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It does not matter what the manager will do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Is this an appropriate to a customer? There were other people at the lobby who were turned down by the same clerk. This is not a good way to conduct a business! Well, we were almost on the verge of leaving but hated to loose a great Internet deal for flight plus the hotel. Our group had to spend almost entire day wondering around the streets looking for a spot to rest. Finally the room was given to us punctually at 3:00 pm, just like he said in the morning. The room was not too clean and smelly. We tried to refresh the air inside, but the AC system didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to work properly leaving us sleeping and breading the stinky air. Next day the same clerk asked us politely if we got a good rest, and we jokingly replied that the pullout sofa bed is fantastic! It made a huge smile on his face, and deep inside we knew that he kept us all day on the street on purpose. BE AWARE OF THIS PLACE. It is true sometimes that you get what you pay for, but I tend to give a credit to those who try to make customer happy. The staff from Travelodge Downtown in Chicago did not even tried to make an affort towards it's customers.

Some of the positives of this hotel are: 1. The front desk workers are marvelous. They were fast, friendly, and very helpful to anything we needed. Check-in and check-out was a breeze and they took the time out to talk with me and answer some \"tourist\" questions that I had. 2. The rooms were in excellent condition. I hear other reviewers crying about how old the rooms are. To me, the rooms were in great condition especially when you consider the price. If you want custom decor, fancy carpet, a luxurious bathroom, etc. then shell out the dough and go to a 4+ star hotel. 3. Parking was only $8 per day. We payed $22/day (for 3 days) at the DoubleTree downtown which was very difficult to do being that we were hotel guests. Some people talk about lack of parking space or location of parking, but we found the parking adequate. Unless each room gets their own stall, you can't expect a prime spot all the time. 4.The location is in the Hotel Circle area. Very convenient to get on and off of the freeways. The outside automobile noise was non-existent once you went inside the room. It's also a stone throw's away from the Mission Valley and Fashion Valley Malls. There are also ton's of stores and eateries in the area. Some of the things that could have been better were: 1. Breakfast was like a madhouse - People were everywhere and the food ran out quickly. It was amazing watching some of the guests take food and eat. You would think as though it was their last meal on earth. When things are free you notice some level of class goes down the drain but I guess that's human nature. A big downer was that breakfast wait staff were not too friendly and NONE of them were smiling. I've read a recent review saying that the breakfast staff seemed overwhelmed and that is very accurate. They looked like they weren't enjoying their jobs. Since the breakfast area is so small, we took our food back to our room as there were no open seats available. Having a complimentary breakfast is such a breath of fresh air and we really appreciated it. Maybe a bigger room and a friendlier breakfast staff (it's hard to look at long faces so early) would've made our morning. 2. Noise from rooms - We stayed on St. Patricks Day and there seemed to be various high school and college groups in the hotel. One thing we didn't like was that the noise level (after 11 p.m.) was not policed better. It would be nice if a security staff member come around after hours to maintain the noise level in on the floors. There were kids running around chasing each other in and out of rooms on our floor. As we walked pass other rooms on our floor, the loud laughing and screaming were very audible. We were glad that they weren't our neighbors for the night. All in all, we had a great experience at the hotel. The staff's friendliness and professionalism made our stay comfortable. We definitely would stay here again and recommend it to our friends.

We found the right one and got checked in. The clerk was very nice and helpful. I asked her about the old style outside rooms and she commented that they were 'grandfathered in' with Comfort Inn's as the owner bought this property and converted it. We were given a family suite on the lower level of the hotel, but there were not any parking spots left by our room so we had to park on the other side of the building. We got to the room and there was a kitchenette in the room which consisted of a very old table that was re-screwed together several times from being broken. The bathroom was not very clean and the rooms were very noisy! The fridge was very noisy and so were the neighbors. The first morning we went to breakfast around 8am and went thru the line and got eggs, sausage, coffee, juice and rolls. I got ready to return to the line and found that there was no food out and that there was a huge line. The breakfast area is very small and does not seat very many people. The waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and nobody was there to wipe tables or anything let alone prepare food. This was by far the worst Comfort Inn that I have ever stayed at! The 2nd night we were able to park by our room, but the breakfast was worse the 2nd day. We went earlier, but they were out of sausage, out of bacon and had just a little bit of eggs and a few sweet rolls and muffins out. For an advertised \"hot breakfast buffet\" it was very pitiful! I would not recommend staying if eating breakfast is important to you. The first night we had coffee packets in our room, the 2nd night we didn't. Guess you only get one per stay!

I am pleased to state that it seems that some of the complaints or issues addressed last September seems to be corrected; however, some new issues have come up which I hope management now realizes and hopefully correct. First, the good news: The defrosted waffles (erroneous stated as pancakes) has been replaced by freshly (self)made ones, and even included a 'Flavor of the Day' batter (would be good to have a sign so we know WHAT it is!), in addition to the Original recipe. It seemed that the entire breakfast has been upgraded, more selections, and much better than before, and for that, we do commend management in attempting to rectify deficiencies. We did notice that there was no cocoa or hot chocolate, which was eliminated. Room was very good for the price that we paid. However ... a couple of things in the room (1420) that were awry were: Dripping faucet in wash basin; surprised that the maid did not report this (embarrassed to say that I forgot to report it when I checked out). When turning on the handle/knob for shower, it's always been my experience that turning clockwise (left) is for Hot water and turning to the right is for Cold water - it is reversed here, but not sure if this is an anomaly or deliberate. Air conditioner/heater was extremely noisy when going on and kept me up at night; had to finally turn it off in order to sleep! I am hoping it is just this ONE room, as I did not have problems of this nature last time I was here. Finally, the $8 charged for parking still bugs me. Should not need this, as hotel is NOT in a downtown area; I realize that it is in Hotel Circle, but some of the other hotels in that area do not charge for parking. Wonder why Comfort Inn feels the need to charge - besides the obvious \"making money\". Anyway, happy to report improvements and hope to continue to see in the future when we stay here.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tutbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel good breakfast but $8 a day to park car!\u201d", "Author": "eyam", "ReviewID": "UR123524185", "Content": "Good position can catch bus to tram and get round without car.

The pool was heated it being December almost and the accompanying water spa if anything too hot! My one gripe is that the whole Hotel Circle was built for just that.

For breakfast, it seems that they now have those (defrosted) pancakes, whereas before we were able to make our own waffles, which were pretty good. The pancakes were not that good and nuking it in the microwave made the edges tough. They started charging $8.00 for parking the last few times we were there. Not sure why besides the obvious reason to make more money. It kinda sticks in my craw when hotels charge you a parking fee when they are already charging you for the room - could be just me - and it is not a 'luxury' hotel in a downtown area. When we checked in the room after a very hot and dusty day, there were no bath towels. Yes, it was brought quickly, but ...

This was absolutely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, in my life. When calling to book a room, we were offered a \"2 bedroom suite, with 2 beds in one bedroom, and one king in the other bedroom.\" So, we arrived expecting a suite with two BEDROOMS, and a common living area. When we arrived, we were dismayed to find that it was not, in fact, two bedrooms, just two regular hotel rooms connected by an interior door. Hotel staff needs to do a better job being clear on what exactly is being offered. Traveling with young children, having a separate living area was a must for naptimes, and bedtimes. We were also very dismayed at the general upkeep and cleanliness of the rooms. The carpet was so filthy, I refused to let my children take their shoes off, and the entire room smelled musty. The bathroom was so tiny one could barely step inside and close the door without actually getting into the shower, and there was grease from the door hinges all over the walls in the bathroom. The laundry area was extremely tiny, and our frustration was compounded by the fact that the dryers did not even work. We were pretty disgusted, but it was late evening, and with several young, cranky children, we really had no other choice but to make the best of things. We got up the next morning (early since we were stuck in the same sleeping area as the children), to rinse out a curdled sippy cup, only to discover that there was an entire PART missing underneath the sink, which caused the dirty water, and curdled milk from the sink to out, all over our luggage (which we couldn't wash, since the dryers didn't work). We then found 2 cockroaches in the corner, when we moved the luggage, and were so disgusted, we knew we had to get out of there. It was approximately 8:30 am, Monday morning when I went to the front desk to cancel our rooms, and get a refund on the night before, and the gentleman behind the desk informed me that a manager had to approve this, and there wasn't one available. I think it's pretty ridiculous not to have someone on property at all times who can handle large issues like this. But, since the gentleman behind the desk was nice, and it wasn't his fault, I agreed to wait. He reported the manager would be in anytime between now (8:30 am) and 9:00 am. So, we were already packed up and out of the room, and had our children in their car seats, in the vans, and had to just sit in the parking lot waiting. When I went back in, at 9:00 am, I was informed it would be another 10 minutes before he arrived. 15 minutes later, I go back in, and I'm told that the manager arrived, but when to the housekeeping office, and didn't take a phone so I have to wait some more. By this point I'm INCREDIBLY frustrated. I sit there another 10 minutes, when the guy behind the counter says \"I'm going to try to reach him via radio.\" WHAT?!? You couldn't have tried this 10 minutes ago? As he goes in the back, another manager walks in the door and agreed to help me. We were able to cancel the following night, and get a refund for the night before, and the new manager seemed to take my concerns seriously, but the fact that I had to sit around for over an hour just to get someone who was able to take care of my concerns was absolutely ridiculous. Next time, perhaps these managers should spend an hour locked in a car with screaming children who are sick of sitting around and going nowhere, and perhaps they will be more accommodating.

Coffee, milk, good orange and apple juice. No cheese, ham, bacon, or scrambled eggs.

Our trip was based on Sea World. We got a room with 2 queen beds. We got our room for $85/night with AAA. Our travel group included my dad and my brother and sister (both 17). We thought that the hotel was great. The room, shower, and beds were clean. I recommend to definitely try to get a room on the second floor, because at night the car's headlights go through the 1st floor room windows. Also, you want to get a room towards the back. The hotel was only three miles (5 minutes via freeway) away from SeaWorld and only 5-10 minutes away from Old Town. After reading the previous reviews and about the breakfast and actually attending it, I have this to say: If you get there between 6:30am and 7:15am then there will not be a crowd and you can easily make your waffle and toast your bagel/bread. If you get there any later, expect to wait because it gets crowded and especially when the hotel is completely booked. The waffle maker becomes a disaster when people make more than one waffle and a line begins to form. The trick for the bagel toasting, is to put it in the toaster and then put in in the movable toaster rack. We did not eat dinner at Ricky's Diner, because it was closed due to the massive egg recall. However, I do recommend going to Old Town and eat in the area where it is closed off to cars. There are a lot of neat little shops. The pool was OK. If you have kids then it is great because it is very family friendly. It is packed at night because everyone leaves their rooms by day and comes back at night. The only problems that I had with the hotel was that there were no recycling bins. Also, the pillows were about half the size of a normal standard pillow. The $5 parking charge was not great but at a budget hotel then it is fine. The parking lot was a little crowed, but you just have to deal with it and carefully park your car. The hotel is across the street from the freeway but it is not directly next to it like the other Comfort Inn in the same general area.

Since I know PL only guarantees double occupancy, I called well in advance to request two beds. This is almost always granted by other hotels. When I arrived, I again asked the front desk person if it was possible to get two beds. He said NOTHING to me, just kept clicking away on his keyboard. He handed me the keys and pointed the way to the room. He gave me a king room. The AC was awful, you'd freeze with the AC or die with just the fan. No happy medium could be found. The breakfast was a joke. The hotel was sold out, so the breakfast room was packed, with only two waffle makers. There weren't any indications of how people should line up for the various foods. The workers would instruct people in Spanish where to line up, but if you weren't bilingual, you could be waiting in the wrong line for 10-20 minutes. Cappucino/ hot chocolate machine was down the whole 4 days we stayed there. Since they had hot water, you'd think they'd supply hot chocolate packets, right. Nope. Housekeeping came at 4:30 pm every day. After a full day of sightseeing with small kids, we expected to come back to a clean room. Alas, no. We had to leave right as the kids started to rest, so the room could be made up. Very often as we were driving through the parking lot, some housekeepers would be strolling down the middle of the road, not moving over to the side for the guests to pass by. One morning we got a call at 7:30am from the \"front desk\" saying there was a computer glich and I needed to give them my credit card info again. I told them I'd be down in a little while, but then they said it must be done immediately and I could give them the info over the phone. I knew it was fishy, and when I went to the front desk, there were a bunch of other people saying they received similar calls. Obviously, the hotel can't stop crank callers, but they didn't offer an apology either. The $5 a night for parking is another pain, especially when a letter at the front desk says it's the cheapest parking in the area. Many of the hotels in Hotel Circle DO NOT CHARGE for parking, so I think FREE is cheaper than $ 5. The TV volume on the regular channels was way lower than the Hotel channel, so you'd have to crank the volume when watching TV, then when you turned it on again, it defaulted to the Hotel channel and it would be blaring!

It was a thursday and we were looking for something close to a mall and possibly not far away from the Zoo. Most Motels are located around this area, so we checked out almost every single place around this area. Well....many of the were fully booked! So we continued to drive up and down the road. Some Hotels had rooms left...but we didn't feel like spending 150-200$ for a night at the Interstate. So we called some Motel Hotlines and were happy to get a room in a nicer Comfort Inn. But just to find out that the guy at the phone made a mistake and got us a room here (instead of a pretty good Comfort Inn, a little east from this place....but we checked and it was booked out too). So annoyed and tired from around 2 hours driving back and forward we decided to stay here for the night.

Check-in was fine enough and the desk clerk told us we got a really good price. C'mon....100$ on a weekday? For this kind of Motel?? Ok, they had a nice pool...but we didn't care about it. Plus, you get to pay 5$ for parking a day....on a roadside chain motel. I mean, we traveled around the US a lot...and this is the first time a chain motel charges for parking! The rooms were really basic and small, but clean enough. No fridge, no microwave. There were lots of people whole day and whole night....so it wasn't quiet! The location would have been ok, just next to a mall and about 10 minutes away from the Zoo (a great Zoo). If we would have had any other choice, we would have stayed somewhere else...next time I just might spend 200$ and check-in in a better place.

All the Comfort Inns have free wireless internet which is great when travelling and planning etc. It was pretty hot in San Diego at the time and while the room had a very efficient aircon it unfortunately was too noisy to leave on during the night even at the lowest setting. We instead max. the aircon to chill the room and then turned it off - but still slightly uncomfortable (this was the same as for the LA Comfort Inn).

We were traveling with extended family on a limited budget. None of us planned on using the hotel room for anything other than showers and sleep and we did not want to spend lots of money on a fancy name. In many respects we were pleasantly surprised by what we found. The hotel is older, but the rooms had received some attention in the not distant past. We were there with about forty football teams attending a football tournament. When we saw them at check-in I wanted to run in the opposite direction. We never heard them at all. This old concrete block building absorbed noise, and we never heard a voice or a footstep even though we were on the bottom floor next to the stairs. The staff was also attentive and quick to call supervisors if the kids got rowdy. The swimming pool area was clean, and the grandchildren enjoyed it enormously. This hotel enjoys an excellent location with easy on and off ramps. There is nothing much available in terms of food or entertainment within walking distance, but it is California where no one walks anywhere anyway. The breakfast was a great attempt at providing something nice. They offered waffles which you could make yourself, hard boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, a huge assortment of pastries, bagels and a variety of breads to toast yourself as well as juice, milk, tea and coffee. The hotel also offered wireless internet in the guest rooms, which we really appreciated. Now the negatives: The floor did not appear to be overly dirty, but it was filthy. The soles of our feet were black. We bathed the babies and they ran to their beds, and in that short journey we had to wash their feet again. It was unpleasant walking about on the floor because we knew it was dirty. The breakfast was great in concept, but in practice it was a dismal failure. It was like they planned to provide space for fifty people and 300 actually showed up. The space available was completely inadequate to the demands of the guests. The first morning we were lucky enough to grab a small table so we had a place for plates, and somewhere for the little ones to sit. There were two waffle makers and a line of 40 people. In addition, the little football kids knew nothing about making waffles and they slowed the process down enormously. The following three days we went to the breakfast room and collected a few things to bring back to the room - mainly bagels and fruit. It was, however, such an ordeal that on our final two days we just went out to breakfast negating the financial advantage of having breakfast provided with the price of the room. The guest laundry facilities were also completely inadequate for the number of rooms. We waited hours to use the washer and dryer and other guests were not responsible about watching their own laundry making everything even more difficult in terms of time. I thought that the hotel was fine for what it was - an aging hotel trying to keep pace with the 21st Century. If I had paid $70/night I would have even felt OK about the breakfast situation. At $100/night I felt that the hotel was over-priced. If you stay here my advice is to give up the luxury of sleeping in on vacation and arrive at the breakfast room when it opens, or give up on breakfast completely, and try to bring enough clothing so it is not necessary to visit the laundry, and take socks to wear on your feet which you can just throw away when you leave.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cOkay, but not great\u201d", "Author": "WEGO2", "ReviewID": "UR31720406", "Content": "The room was very, very small, 3226, but was clean and quiet.

It was mainly breads, bagels, some cereal, a few fruit, etc. and, of course, waffles. Not bad, but no hot eggs or anything special. Our main complaints were that they charged for parking. Normally, that isn't a big deal (it was only $5), but the parking was very tight and I had to park far away from the room. Also, the main page of Comfort Inns website even states that there is free parking. To make matters even worse, there was no easy or direct was to get from the car/lobby area to the room. I had to walk all the way around the building because the pool was closed. On a non-holiday weekend, this place would probably be better and it wasn't too bad overall.

This hotel (Hotel Circle SOUTH - there is a different one on Hotel Circle North), is a multi-building facility with lots of rooms. Ours was clean and very comfortable. The front desk staff was welcoming and very accommodating, as were all the other employees on the grounds. I like the fact that they seem to have round the clock faciliites personnel - they were out in their golf carts all the time, and responded to every request immediately. There were lots of families at the hotel, apparently visiting the local attractions. Nevertheless, we always found a nice table at the breakfast buffet. There was a lot of variety, but I would not consider it special. They have waffles, danish and juices, but the only healthy food were hard boiled eggs, apples, oranges and raisin bran cereal. I wish they included some whole grains, such as bran muffins or oatmeal. Fortunately, we had brought our own cereal and other items. This being said, the employees kept the buffet filled and the tables clean all the time. It was a busy yet very clean and inviting environment. The grounds are kept immaculate, and the pool/jacuzzi area is very nice. They even have two barbecue grills there for guests. At other locations around the premises, you can find vending machines with drinks and snacks, ice machines, and a well-lit guest laundry. There is no fitness center, but guests can use the one at a sister hotel down the street. One of our family members used it twice, and reported it to be very nice. There is also a restaurant on the premises, where we ate breakfast when a local friend told us they were famous for their apple pancake, which is a \"dutch baby\" smothered in cinnamon apples. All the items we ordered at the restaurant were great! For the price, this hotel is a VERY good value.

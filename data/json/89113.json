{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Mixed Emotions I have really mixed emotions about our stay. We LOVE independent establishments, but I'm not sure that I would stay at the Olivier House again. We rented the garden suite - a two story room with courtyard, fountain, trees, sitting room, full bath w/tub and kitchenette on the first floor and spiral staircase leading to a loft bedroom and full bath w/shower on the second floor. It sounded so funky and fun...but fell a little short. Some cons...the trees were over-grown (making it hard to enter the room), the fountain didn't work, the bath tub drain didn't close and the coffee maker was missing. Minor things. Some major things though...the lock was so flimsy (you could literally push the door open when locked) and the second story floor (especially around the vanity and shower) felt like it was going to cave in. BUT some pros...the location was great (so close to Bourbon, but you couldn't hear a thing!!), the courtyard was nice, the staff was helpful, and the parking was free (though there aren't in/out privileges). With a little TLC and a good cleaning - the room would have been awesome. But all in all - though I wanted to, I didn't love it. One great recommendation though...eat at Elizabeth's in the Bywater area. A FANTASTIC breakfast...our best meal of the weekend!", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR964414515", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Suz-Q73"}, {"Content": "Health  I booked this hotel over the phone as New Orleans was experiencing high demand due to a medical conference. I believe the room allocated was a one bedroom suite. Upon entering the room there was a strong musty smell, I received an electric shock turning down the air conditioning and turning off a lamp in the bedroom, there was only 1 glass in the wet bar which was a dirty champagne glass, there were no clean glasses, coffee cups or coffee although the wet bar was equipped with a coffee maker. After requesting these basic articles be sent to my room, housekeeping arrived to inform me, I was to clean the dishes myself, even though there was no dishwashing liquid, plug or sponge either! The toilet ran constantly, I stood in 3 inches of brown water in the shower, which the tiles were cracked and mouldy and when I sat down to watch the television in the lounge area a mouse ran across the room!!!I went downstairs and voiced my issues to the manager, who immediately became defensive and chose to take my grievances as a personal attack rather than addressing the serious health and safety issues and then proceeded to tell me it would be preferrable that I check out the next day.I have worked as a Director of Sales in the hospitality industry for 5 years and the travel industry for 20 years and would have been sacked on the spot if I spoke to my guests or clients in that manner. I was shown two other rooms to chose from after the rodent issue and neither of these rooms were any better. The door locks are extremely flimsy and most do not even offer a chain lock as added security once you are inside the room. I would strongly disuade people from staying at this hotel until these issues are addressed and basic safety measures are implemented, however based on the managers attitude, I doubt this will happen anytime soon.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR916927044", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Futuretravels"}, {"Content": "The New York Pool Party Loves the Olivier House!!!

Booked 2 rooms, one for my boyfriend and I (room 101) and one from my brother and his wife (room 201).Hotel itself is nothing like the website. It was quite dirty and messy and the hotel staff told me they were remodeling. There were lots of plastic bags stashed to the side of the staircase. The carpet was really old and dull. Definitley needs replacing. My room was below average...very very old, stained old wallpaper, stains on the celing, old bedcothes. the towels were awful, and smelt horrible. bathroom was also strange, had an actual curtain for the shower-curtain. The bed wasn't great and the head board was completely broken and had an old pillow behind it to keep it from banging against the wall.We had cockroaches in the bathroom, huge ones at that. Really disgusting. When I called reception to move rooms, I was told that the hotel was full, nothing they could do. In the morning I asked again, and the response was they would put a bug bomb in the bathroom. I went off on a day trip and returned around 4pm when I bumped into the housekeeping lady who knew nothing about the bug bomb. All very unprofessional. I was told they would bring a glue trap and hide it behind the strange sideboard come sink. i couldn't bear to check again if they actually put it there.The good point is the location, really close to burbon street where all the action is.Note: My brother  his wife stayed in room 201 which was much much nicer and seemed cleaner, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. They had a nice four poster bed and period furniture in the room and clean modern bathroom.

It was my third time visiting New Orleans and I always stay in the French Quarter area and never in chain hotels, and I must say this was by far the best stay. The staff are all amazing and will do everything to make you feel at home. They do so many extra's and never any added charges for your stay or needs. Our A/C had been running for days so it had froze up and was not working, in the meantime, incase it didn't work they saved us another gorgeous suite with a giant fountain and courtyard inside the room! Fortunately our A/C did just need to defrost and all was good. The entire property is just beautiful! The courtyard is gorgeous, the pool is clean and great to swim in. Every inch of the place has something unique to admire. There is even a tiny, but old elevator that has room for 1 or 2 with luggage. Our room was a loft style suite that is streetside with a balcony, 2 beds + hide a bed, mini fridge, toaster, microwave, coffee maker,plenty of closet  storage space, a huge bathroom with separate shower and soaker tub, fireplace, 2 televisions, one in the upstairs and one on the main floor. The rooms were clean  the decor perfectly suited. We stayed for a week so it was nice to settle in and it never felt like you were in a hotel. It was more than one would expect for the incrediblely reasonable rates thay have, especially in the off season.Not that there were any problems but I would suggest ear plugs if you are streetside due to the noise from garbage pick up and street maintenence. Also, we had about 6 cockroaches which were easy to catch and release, but if you leave your balcony door open they will fly in at night.

In June of 2005, I stayed in a hotel near the French Quarter for two nights. I enjoyed New Orleans so much, that I decided to stay another night. However, I wanted a hotel much closer to the entertainment of the F.Q., so I did a little shopping around (on foot.) I found that the Olivier House was very close to Bourbon St., was one of the very few hotels with free parking in the F.Q., and was very affordable and beautiful.  When I was ready to explore, I was literally steps away from the action. The location is excellent if you are interested in architecture, culture, or entertainment. And if your spirits get too high, you can safely walk the few steps back to your room. I have to admit, the idea of leaving my keys with a hotel staff member made me a little uneasy at first. But, he patiently and politely answered all of my questions about safety, accessibility, and incidental history. It was a tight squeeze to fit my car into the parking area, but a staff member soon safely rearranged all of the cars. I do recommend that you plan to leave your car in the parking area during the entire stay. Once I was ready to leave the hotel, my car was at the very back of the area. I simply requested that the staff member back it out for me, and then I closed my eyes as he gracefully squeezed past the other cars. He was very professional and helpful. So, for free parking in the French Quarter, what more can you ask? The Olivier was also one of the most affordable hotels that I priced near the F.Q. (After a couple of fun days in New Orleans, you will probably be looking for affordable too!) The inside of the hotel was historically beautiful. The courtyards were very serene and exuded the Big Easy atmosphere. I felt very comfortable and safe in my room and every other part of the hotel.  I had a balcony room just off of Toulouse St. The room was very spacious, clean, and insect and rodent-free. The furniture was a mix of antiqued and modernized detail: the bathroom sink was an antique dresser of drawers with a modern marble top. The unworldly traveler might mistake the bedroom decor for old, ragged, or dirty. When, in fact, it was none of the above. It simply had the illusion of the 1800's Creole culture, which I found very charming! As for the noise -- in the New Orleans French Quarter, do you honestly expect silence? If so, you are in the wrong part of town. The noise didn't bother me one bit. As a matter of fact, I slept with the window open just for the pure joy of a different world.

The only noise we heard was from people talking loudly in the hall outside the room and someone running a vacuum once. No noise from the street came through to the courtyard side.Our sitting room had a small couch, chair, TV, refrigerator and a ceiling fan. The bedroom was in a loft up a short flight of stairs. The A/C was in tiptop shape! The staff was very friendly, helpful and courteous. They answered all our questions, gave great directions and were just plain nice folks. When I called to make reservations, I asked about the parking. I was told it was secure, free, limited space and no in-and-out. It was a tad scary backing the car out, but if we\u9225\u6a87 needed another car moved, it wouldn\u9225\u6a9b have been a problem. All the places with valet parking also charge $20-$30 a day. If you want a luxury hotel with 350 count linens, stay at W or the Ritz. If you want a cookie cutter hotel, stay at the Ramada. If you want French Quarter charm at it\u9225\u6a9a finest, stay at the Olivier House.

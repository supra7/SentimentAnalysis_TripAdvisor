First off.,,the pictures on the website are so outdated..it doesnt even look like the hotel. The hotel is run down and nasty. I contacted the sales rep prior to us checking in and I told her that we wouldnt be checking in until late because our conference didnt end until late. But when we arrived the front desk person asked why are you all here so late! That is really rude considering you are just arriving. I was told that all rooms would have refrigerators and they werent. Some rooms had spiders and were dirty. Of course no one was going to come up and clean anything considering we were told that we were late checking in.It was the worst experience ever and I would never stay here again and never recommend this place to anyone!! It was really embaricing for the youth of our church to go home to there parents that they slept in dirty rooms.

It turns out, they were dealing drugs from the hotel. I had to walk back and forth with my 4 year old daughter by these two men for 3 days while we were there! They stood outside the ENTIRE time we were there as their customers pulled up in cars constantly! It was ridiculous and I was scared. When it came to the actual room....let me tell you, it was gross.

First, when I checked in, I found that the king room that I reserved was unavailable and we had to settle for a double queen. We got to the room and it was just tiny. Second, the Pool was a long walk all outside to the back 40 of the hotel. When we got out to the pool, there were no towels. So the long walk back to the lobby in our suits to get towels. THe pool and hot tub were also not very clean. leaves and dirt at the bottom.Third, The elevator sounded like a dying cow, and we noticed the inspection report was 2 years overdue. Not a big deal but kind of weird for a hotel to not have up to date inspection reports. Breakfast was okay, although the bagels were stale all 3 days we stayed there. The door to our room did not close and latch without jimmying the door handle. Room service cleaned our room, and when we got back, found the room was unlocked and anyone could have gone in. That was annoying! Not like we had any valuables, but still... Overall a cheap hotel and not what I expected from a Ramada, but I guess you get what you pay for!

Anyways, the Ramada was great! The price was super affordable and the amenities were great. There was a pool and a jacuzzi right outside our building. The pool was heated as well so it was great for a nighttime dip. There was also complimentary breakfast which was delicious. Items ranged from cereal and fruit, to waffles, pastries, and bagels. There was also a workout room in the hotel which was one of the amenities I was looking for that Days Hotel did not have. While the Ramada was right off the highway, we were in the building that was the farthest set back, and were never disrupted by traffic at all. Parking was included in the charges and there was both indoor and outdoor parking spaces. The view from the hotel was of the hilly California landscape, and there were great sunsets in the area. Location was another strong suit for this hotel. It seemed like we could get everywhere we needed to in 20 minutes or less. The airport was super close, as well as downtown San Diego, and my sister's school. Overall, I would definitely recommend the Ramada at Hotel Circle in San Diego. p.s.

But I was really pleasantly surprised. For the price we paid, the overall quality of the room I got was very high. It makes me wonder, actually, whether there might be a huge disparity in room quality depending on where within the Ramada Plaza you stay. Maybe some rooms are newer and better kept than others? We stayed on the second floor of the \"second\" building, putting us farther away from the street (thus perhaps making for a quieter night's sleep). The hallway smelled off, but the room itself was perfectly fine. Could be that in other spots you get crap, but our room was just fine: the furniture is bare-bones but perfectly fine, the room was pretty clean (though the cleaning crew left a used cleaning rag behind one day), the bed was comfy, the towels were a bit rough but absorbed water properly, the iron made clothes straighter...

We wanted to be in the hotel circle area, which is close to all attractions with easy freeway acess. We had stayed in the hotel circle area about 6 years ago, at a different hotel. The second was price. We went through a travel agent and the package price was under $90 per night with two queen beds. Ramada has a good reputation, and we were banking on it. Rather than trying a hotel we have never heard of. The hotel staff were very good and freindly. The room was a good size, with a fridge and micro, and a very sm. one cup coffee maker. The bathroom area had two sinks, one in the bath with the tiolet and nice shower with full sized tub. The other in a dressing area, which made it much easier for two people to be getting ready at once in the morning. Very nice comfy beds, comforters and four fluffy pillows to each bed. Just right for watching TV in bed and proping your back up. Free parking was good, most of the time we parked right by the door. The restaurant on property was too exspencive, and had very limited menu items. We did buy dessert one night to take up to our room. Big mistake...two cups of ice cream, and one piece of chocolate cake, $18.00+ tax. There is a little store down the street that has just about all you need, at resonable prices. There are two great restaurants we found on hotel circle. Adam's and Abbie's just to the east of the hotel same side of the street and Hunter steak house, just on the otherside of the freeway both are very close by. Great food, and excellent service at both. They have a nice laundry there. We had to wash clothes half way through our stay. The desk has soap for $1.25, the washers and dryers are new and commercial grade. They only cost a $1.00 each. Very reasionable, and efficeint. I happend to do laundry on Wed. night, and was surprised to find a extra special treat. They have a food and beverage reception every Wed. night. They have wine and beer, sodas, cheeses, friut and vegies, crakers. We were dissapointed with the pool and jaccuzzi(sp?) area.

The reality is a very small area, even smaller pool which only goes from 3ft. to 4.5ft. , the jaccuzzi's bubbles were sad, lots of noise and not much power. Only 3-4 chase loung chairs, two umbrella tables one with benches and one only had one chair. Not much vegitation, a few tall trees on one side. Pluses for the pool area were that both were clean, warm, and hot. Plenty of pool towles, and a phone to call for more if they run out. They do have a computer in the lobby area you can use. Don't plan on being able to use it unless you like to wait. The sign says 15 min. limit, and is not inforced. If you have a laptop bring it, they do have internet in the rooms. We just don't have a laptop, and needed directions from time to time. Over all we had a very nice stay. We had a room in the back (ask, if you want one that is quiet, and closest to the pool) if you want a fridge and micro you have to ask for that as well as a no smoking room. I would recomend this hotel for the most part, would really be nice if the pool area was better. If you don't care much about swimming and such, it is a great place to stay.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "bostonSkT", "ReviewID": "UR16254152", "Content": "The first night I was in San Diego we stayed at the Kings Inn, this turned out to be a terrible mistake - The next morning I went online and found this Ramada.

My son did order room service one night and he said the food was very good and the $3.00 service charge was quite reasonable. We had breakfast next store at a nice diner, the food was very good. The rooms are on the small side. We had two queens and our bed was right up against the wall so my husband had to crawl in from the bottom of the bed. They're a bit dated, mirror on the entire wall by our bed so my hubby had a good laugh while staring at himself while trying to go to sleep. The bathrooms were ok, clean and hot showers so I'm not going to complain. TV was a bit dated and the picture was on the dark side but we only watched it briefly while waking and just before going to bed. We used the pool a few different times and it's heated so my grand daughter loved it. The hot tub was HOT...but a bit dirty so I don't typically use hot tubs at hotels because they're not cleaned and treated regularly. One issue is that we had to call for towels boths times we used the pool because there were none...not a big deal. Overall we enjoyed our stay at what I would say is a three star hotel.

Cons: There were so many little things wrong that it added up to one big disappointment, which angered me more because most of it was so unnecessary. We were in the main building, in a newly decorated room, and compared to what other reviewers have said, the furniture/fixtures were in good shape. But the TV was TINY \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not much bigger than my computer screen, for pete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake! I could only control it with the remote (not on the TV itself), which worked about one time in 20 clicks (very annoying!!). If we moved the TV even an inch, the reception was ruined. The lights near the beds didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pulled the bedside table out and found that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plugged in (and what a mess of wires and shoddy workmanship I found behind the table!) There was a switch near the door, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out what it was for until I finally found a light plug that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the socket. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plug my cell phone charger in the plug on the mirrored wall. There was a refrigerator and microwave in the room, which was great, but they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t housed in a cabinet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were just placed on the floor (microwave sitting on top of refrigerator)! There was a coffee maker, but no stirrers - when we called, we were told we could come down and get some (Hello? How about Housekeeping fixing their mistake by bringing the item to our room?). The single elevator was interminably slow, and the only stairs were at the far other end of the building from my room (the set nearest to me only allowed exit from the building). The only vending machine in the building was broken. The staffer delivering the morning USA Today at our doors used a cart with a loud squeal, which woke me up 2 hours before I needed to get up. The pool is certainly nothing fancy, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really bother me - there really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of room on the lot for a pool, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think people come to this hotel/location for the pool amenities, anyway. There were plenty of towels when I was there. The restaurant seemed pricey, although supposedly it has won Ramada-based awards. I only had lunch there, but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed.

The front desk clerk was very nice but also very young and seemed kind of nervous. This could be because both my credit and debit cards were both denied. They both had plenty of money but for some reason weren't working. Maybe the guy thought I was nuts or something because I was a bit worked up needing to find a room with them in such short supply and then having credit AND debit card problems. But the guy was very helpful and attentive. Finally I ended up being able to just pay cash with a hundred dollar deposit. The guy then gave me a room that he said was a business room or business person section or something...he said then we'd have a fridge and microwave. He did ask me though if my four year old daughter was a fairly quiet child because she'd need to be to stay in this area. I thought that was a little weird but hey I was thrilled to get the microwave and fridge. Oh yes he also mentioned that this room was supposedly a bit bigger than others. We stayed on the third floor in the back building. This was kind of a pain but it was nice too because the pool was clear back by this building. Sort of in the corner of the parking lot which I thought was a weird place and very inconvenient for the guests in the main building. The door into the building had a sign saying it was always locked for our safety however it was open most of the time. We took the elevator up to our room and let me tell you if this was a larger room than usual I'd really hate to see the size of the the others. This room had two queen beds and it was one of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in. It had the fridge, microwave, table with two chairs, a sort of desk table and chair, and the TV in the amoiore. That was WAY too much stuff in this itty bitty room. The bathroom was very clean and pretty nice, nothing fancy but nicer than usual I'd say. Then it also had a seperate sink vanity area. It was very nice to have the two sinks and mirrors, saved us time getting ready in the morning. There was also an in room safe which was nice as well. We could see the entire pool area from our window and unfortunately we could hear just about all the noise from it too. We just turned on the fan or the air and then you couldn't hear much of it. TV came in fine but I found the channels lacking. They did offer pay movies and video games which we didn't use but is nice to have. The hotel also offered room service from their restaraunt the TIckled Trout. There was a two dollar per person charge plus a 17% gratuity added to every room service order. I thought that was high when the prices were high already for what you got. But we did use room service three or four times. Each time the food was brought up well before the amount of time they said it would take, which was great. Nothing we had from there was bad but it was nothing to write home about either, again especially with what we were paying. On one of the days my husband went down to the restaurant and got the breakfast himself which of course was much cheaper. He said the restaurant was dark and gloomy, I didn't see it myself so I can only give you his opinion. We ate next door at Ricky's for breakfast and it was okay. We also ate down the road at Valley Kitchen I believe it was called. Nothing fancy but it was decent as well. One thing I do want to complain about was the \"guest laundry.\" This was actually a tiny area off of the exercise area that had two washers and dryers. Up untill our last night one of the washers wasn't working so that was really inconvenient. We really hated it because we were clear back in the back building so we either had to drive down and risk losing our parking spot, or walk down and back up the really steep hill with all the laundry. Plus you never knew if someone else was down there using the machines. We thought with the amount of guests at this hotel they could've offered more machines and maybe even one in the back building. To make matters worse the dryers took forever. The laundry was supposed to close at ten at night but we were up past midnight one night waiting for our clothes to dry, they never did all the way. We got so sick of going back and forth between buildings that we just sort of camped out in the lobby....with our four year old daughter. I think we sort of annoyed the front desk people but oh well maybe they should get some machines in the other building! The pool area was okay. Again very weird placement though. The pool itself was small but clean. The hot tub looked nasty on one of the nights but was fine the rest of the time. There's nobody down there keeping an eye on things and we did see some pretty rowdy drunk people at different times, but other than that it was mostly families like us. I do have to say that the hotel circle area is very convenient to sea world, mission beach, and old town. The only problem we had was wanting to find some fast food restaurants to save money. We remembered seeing a Wendy's nearby but couldn't seem to find it again. We called the front desk and they told us the closest place was some jack in the box that wasn't close at all. Eventually we found the Wendy's and a couple of other places on our own, I felt like the front desk people should've easily been able to tell us where to find the closest fast food joint though. When we checked in on the back of the hotel layout map there were decent directions to many different places you might want to visit and those came in very handy for us.The hotel circle area is very crowded though so if you want to stay out of the way you DON'T want to stay here. All in all the place was okay. For the price though they could've at least had a continental breakfast at the least. We paid anywhere from $114.00 to $179.00 on any given night we stayed so I feel like a simple free breakfast wouldn't be too much to ask for.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cRoom size is okay, but the room has an odor *free w-fi*\u201d", "Author": "ishyjo", "ReviewID": "UR5025725", "Content": "The lobby was clean, and pleasing to the sight. The customer service was good at the counter. There was plenty of coffee for guests at the lobby when we checked in. This is good because most other places will not have coffee after the morning hours. Our room was on the 4th floor (highest floor) and had to take the elevator. As we ride in the elevator, we can't help but notice that they have not renewed their elevator licensing permit (expired sometime in 2005). It makes us wondering if they really do a good job maintaining the elevator hydrolics. When we entered the room, we can't help but notice an odor that persisted as we enter. The odor smell like dried urine or some kind of unpleasant smell. We tried to air it out by turning the AC on and opening the windows. After 3 hours, some remnent of the smell still persisted. Next morning, when we got up, we can still smell the odor. I don't know if the problem occured only in this room, or it's a problem throughout the 4th floor or the entire hotel, but it presented a bad impression on the hotel. That's why I gave it 2 - okay, but some problems. The wi-fi option in the room was a plus for this hotel. My laptop detected the signal easily and there was no hassle surfing the net. If I had an option, I would probably not stay here again -- but then again, the problem can be just the particular room we got. Wifi in the guestroom would be the only reason I would come back.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfax, VA", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "ck1220", "ReviewID": "UR5014021", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for one night in April of 2006.

Hallway smelled pretty bad and elevator had some dark gray wood panel interior which almost make you feel depressed just looking at it. Room was pretty small, furniture was super old, wall paper was peeling, and etc. Even the mattress were even. I booked this hotel through hotwire.com and it said that this hotel has a 3 star rating. There is no way this hotel deserves 3 star rating...maybe 2 star rating, if that. Only thing nice about this hotel was the location.

They went above and beyond the call of duty to help us out, and for that I will definitely stay there again. The room was spacious and clean with a separate vanity from the bathroom, the location to the highway, restaurants, and 7-11 was very convenient. We were on the 4th floor of the 2nd building and right across the room was a cheaper hotel with some college guys partying all night, but we never even heard them. We got back from dinner about 11pm and found a better parking spot than when we checked in. We didn't use the pool, but it seemed a bit of a walk and thrown in the corner of the parking lot.

Was planning trip to San Diego and needed a two night stay before checking into La Costa. Unfortunately, La Costa bumped us for a convention group so extended stay at the Ramada. Had a little difficultly with extended two night stay because original reservation made on internet and they couldn't extend for two additional nights. Had to call hotel directly. Was given many different answers to questions regarding our stay and the cost of the 4 nights but in the end, everything worked out great. Read a few of these reviews about a week before we were suppose to make the trip and they caused me great concerns because several other couples were booked here also based off my recommendation. Wasn't sure what we were going to do if we got there and found out it was an undesireable place to stay. Pleased to say that our room was above average. The bed very comfortable. We were on the 2nd floor and had no problem with noise. We weren't that far from the Pub and again, no noise problems. The Pub was comfortable for happy hour and a nightcap. The bartenders were very friendly and helpful. Would also like to recommend several restaurants in the area. Ricky's next door is a great place to have pancakes (light and fluffy). Albie's Beef Inn down the street in the Travelodge is a great place for a steak. Had the filet and would highly recommend that. The filet was melt in your mouth and comes with a twice baked potato and sweetened carrot which was also terrific. We did not eat at the Ramada so couldn't recommend that one way or the other. Parking might be a problem if you get back really late at night but we were usually back to the hotel by 11 at the latest and didn't have any problem then. Would recommend this hotel to friends.

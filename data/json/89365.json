The hotel is one of those older (historic?) hotels that has been well maintained. Not elaborate but very nice. I was immediately impressed by service of the valet team who could not have been nicer. Same for front desk staff. Our room was very nicely appointed and also very clean. Not huge but comfortable for two people. Nice view of the city. Comfy beds. Really quite nice and reasonably priced. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant with all the wedding people (group of about 15-20) without prior arrangements and I can't say enough about the patience of our server. Believe me I don't think I could have been as kind! Only two complaints: never could get wifi although for the short stay I didn't follow up with front desk so... My second complaint is that the bar stops serving around 11 which is quite early. Not realizing, we ordered shortly before that and before even finishing 1 glass of wine were told we needed to leave and would have to bring our drinks down to the lobby or to a small table in the hallway to finish?!?

The waterfront/pier area is about a $10 taxi ride each way but is also accessible by public transport. We had our car with us (valet parking at the hote is $29/day) but did not want to deal with finding parking. Bathrooms are clean and spacious with a nice selection of Bath and Body Works toiletries, hair dryer and towel warmer. Bed were a little too soft and pillows were too clumpy for my taste.

The good: Rooms and hallways are recently renovated and comfortable, clean and ordelry too. Valet parking and front desk service were efficient (valet is not cheap though, and there are cheaper secure parking alternatives very near by). The location is nice for downtown, albeit a $10/10 minute cab ride away from the Inner Harbor or Fells Point. The entry is not glamorous but is efficient. Requiring key cards for elevator operation at all times and all floors is probably a good idea. The televisions were new 40\" LCDs with a decent HD channel selection, properly configured, although cheaping out and having Showtime and not HBO is an odd move. The room service, at least for breakfast, had the lowest prices I have seen in a hotel in twenty years -- a full American breakfast for well under $10, and no delivery charge (20% mandatory gratuity added). A value in itself, and interesting as a business strategy. We stopped by the bar for a late night drink and dessert and were similarly impressed by low prices. (Room rate was good as well, a pricing trifecta). The bad: uneven service on several dimensions. That room service, even with its attractive pricing, was very poorly executed. The delivery time we'd specified on the door hanging card came and went the next morning, and a check outside the room revealed why: no one had picked it up, even though we'd left it there before 8 p.m. We called and placed the order, and when it arrived it was delivered with no water and (bizarrely) one paper packet of salt (for an order for four people including eggs and potatos) and no pepper.

I had called the hotel before I booked because I was traveling with children. They advised the double bed suite because it was roomier with a kitchenette with microwave and fridge. I paid 30% more and we took that room. When we arrived at about 9pm, the room was nice enough, but NO microwave and a mini-fridge sitting on the counter. I went to the front desk. The fellow said he was alone !? but would try to get one. I explained that we were a family with kids and a baby and would not be able to eat without the microwave and suggested he simply transfer one from an empty room. The microwave never arrived. The kids and us ate cold TV dinners. A little before 11pm my wife put the kids in the bath. Problem - NO hot water. They suggested we let the water run. That did not work. In the meantime the desk persons shift was over and a new fellow came and gave us keys to other rooms to try to find hot water. The rooms for several floors above us were empty and we found one which did have hot water but no water coming out of the kitchenette sink! Now we had a microwave too in this one, so we figured we can manage here and took the room, transferring the kids and our luggage at about midnight. The next day we had no room service don't know why and Saturday evening ONLY boiling hot water came out of the faucets, nothing else. I almost burned myself. When I asked the front desk how they could rent such rooms he just shrugged and said \"to tell you the truth I don't know\". If not for the guys honesty and friendliness I would have raised a greater ruckus. The staff told me there was this ongoing problem with the number X09 and X10 room lines going all the way up. A friend of ours on the twelfth floor in one of the cheaper single bedded rooms told us he had a great stay without problems, so PLEASE check your room before you unpack. The bedding was ok, unremarkable, though the covers were lumpy. The hotel was clean in all its areas. Our coffee was never replaced during the stay. Toiletries were replaced. The location though not that close to the inner harbor has a charm of its own.

We had problems with the hot water - not particularly hot and also somewhat unpredictable. When we reported this to the housekeeper, a service person came within 15-minutes. Unfortunately, the problem with water was sporadic. All in all, a decent place to stay.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service\u201d", "Author": "Kwats", "ReviewID": "UR121517453", "Content": "The staff at this hotel is excellent.

The 9th floor room we had overlooked the square which was beautifully lit for Christmas. The room was very large with two comfortable double beds. Furnishings were very nice and tasteful - beautiful wood headboards, an antique nightstand, armoire for the TV and a desk. Did not feel like a hotel room - more like you were a guest in very nice house. There were nice architectural features - tall baseboards, large crown mouldings and very deep window sills. Beautiful bathroom with marble tiles on floor and full walls, heated towel rack, wall-mounted extension mirror, and jetted tub. The \"dresser\" consisted of built-in drawers behind closet doors with a very large mirror and light above - very nice. Another \"closet\" had a mini-fridge, etc. And a third \"closet\" was an actual closet. A very pleasant room. If I were to be picky, I would say housekeeping was not meticulous. While the bathroom was very, very clean and the main surfaces in the room were clean, the tops of the headboards and baseboards could have used a dusting, and the vacuuming of the carpet missed the edges near the baseboards. But this certainly wasn't an issue for our one night stay. Also, parking could be difficult. There is very limited space to pull up and use their valet service - just an area where the sidewalk cuts in that can maybe hold 2 cars. When we arrived after 11pm on a Saturday night, that space was full and more cars were parked next to them in the street. We were able to park in the Walters Art Museum lot just a few buildings away since the museum was closed and we left early the next morning before it opened. So it turned out to be a lucky break that we couldn't get to use the (expensive) valet parking service. The restaurant was beautiful and the waitress very pleasant. Not impressed with the breakfast food.

The staff at the Peabody Court made it a wonderful weekend for our guests. The staff is extremely gracious, going out of their way to help in every way. We arrived with gift bags for out-of-town guests and the valet whisked them to the back where the staff placed them in all the rooms of guests registered through the wedding. The staff seemed to anticipate every detail and work to make the weekend a seamless affair. The staff at George's (the restaurant attached to the hotel) were also gracious and accommodating. I had breakfast and lunch there and all my meals were well prepared. When our crowd of relatives lingered to chat after our meals were eaten, they invited us to sit over in the lounge area of the bar so we could socialize without monopolizing their dining area, a lovely compromise. Our hotel room was large and had a bar sink area, a small refrigerator and a good full length mirror. As this is a refitted, older hotel room size and configuration varied a great deal. My father was delighted with his walk in shower, which we had requested, but it was a tight fit in the room for him, his walker and the wheelchair we had rented for his use. Still, it worked and he commented how very helpful the staff had been in getting him checked in and situated in his room when he arrived. Internet is free, but required a provided password which had to be re-entered periodically, a small annoyance. The public rooms were very elegant and well maintained. The business center would be fine for printing out boarding passes, but the office suite and Internet browser it used were odd. It would not allow me to cut and paste from the internet into a document....very odd. I had to print out and retype the poem I wanted in a larger font to read at the ceremony. We had the rehearsal dinner upstairs in a beautiful room with panoramic views of the city. It was lovely that night to look out over the lights of Baltimore with a gigantic harvest moon shining down. Here however is my only complaint of the stay. The service getting dinner out to our guests was slow. The crab cakes were overcooked and dry plus sides of plain rice with 3 (THREE) small asparagus spears was disappointing to say the least. Still the convenience of being able to have my brother simply wheel our father onto the elevator to get him to the rehearsal dinner along with the gorgeous setting made it a good evening overall. The hotel is also pet friendly. There is a lovely little park right across the street and it is a nice area for walking your dog. The City of Baltimore even had little receptacles spotted about with plastic bags for doggy clean-up. Overall this was a wonderful hotel with a tremendous staff. I give this hotel my highest recommendation.

The key-card elevator IS tricky, but after 4 or 5 swipes, we always got to where we wanted to go. Having a refrigerator in the room is a plus. Internet access in the business center was functional, but slow. Paula at the desk was helpful with getting us theater information and an easy check-out. Mount Vernon is a great Baltimore neighborhood! We took the light rail three stops from Penn Station, then had an easy 2 block walk to the hotel. I love NOT being in Inner Harbor, but being able to get there easily. We walked to the Walters Art Museum, Center Stage Theater, the Basilica, the Aquarium, Camden Yards (easy light rail ride back late-night), the B+O Railroad Museum (that was a long walk). There are many great restaurants within blocks of the Wyndham, and the Charm City Circulator has stops nearby. We easily navigated the city bus to Johns Hopkins (admittedly, we had a kind of sketchy ride back). We loved George's Restaurant! All-day breakfast is available and tasty, and the one dinner we had there was excellent. They have many, many bottled beers, and the bar crowd was active and provided good people-watching without being obnoxious. Kate, John, and Melody were friendly and efficient workers. The coffee is good. There were a few glitches- the front desk was a zoo with 4 weddings on the day we checked in. Our room wasn't ready so we left our bags and were told they'd call when it was ready. The call never came, so we wasted several hours waiting when we could have had the room. Room service dishes were left in the hallway for a very long time. There was a full breakfast tray on the floor across from our room for 24 hours. Housekeeping happened very late in the day.

Our large bathroom had all marble floors and walls plus a heated towel bar. It would be easy to stay for an extended time and not feel cramped although we would have preferred a higher toilet with a comfortable seat that flushed easier (you had to hold the flush button down hard for 5-10 seconds.) Unfortunately, we expected to be able to see Baltimore Orioles baseball games on our room TV, having been assured by the desk clerk when making our reservation, but found that the hotel rooms do not subscribe to MASN, the Maryland Sports Network (which also broadcasts football and other pro games). Although there's a high quality restaurant on the 2nd floor, the menu was all American crab cakes and steaks--nothing adventurous, but fortunately there are many good places within walking distance for us to dine. The restaurant also restricted guests to expensive room service, leaving us disappointed with the inability to walk into the restaurant for coffee to go--which would have been easy to implement with the coffee bar right at its entrance. (Many people instead walked to a nearby coffee shop instead of making coffee in-room in the 1-cup appliance that had no access to real cream.) The valet car service was good, but they need to come up with some inventive seating in the small but stately lobby for infirm people waiting for their vehicles--you can only sit if you go 4-5 steps down into the library.

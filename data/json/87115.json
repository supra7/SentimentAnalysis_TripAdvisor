That's the appeal: proximity. The shuttle from hotel door to airport check-in seemed to take only 5-10 minutes. The hotel itself is a multistory business-type hotel. My room was spacious and well-equipped but not stunning. I sleep easily, and I had no trouble with airplane noise despite proximity to the airport. It's across the street from the Latin Cafe. A Miami friend described this as a sort of local institution, popular with those who desire Cuban food. We met there for a delicious breakfast that made me a fan of cortaditos (espresso with milk and sugar). A tip: Latin Cafe has several locations--if you're meeting a friend, be sure they know which one to go to. Also, traffic is heavy on LeJeune Road--you'll need to walk a bit to a traffic signal in order to cross the street. It's close to a gas station to the south. This can be handy in filling the tank before you return your rental car--or making a purchase at its small convenience store. This hotel fills the bill--at least for me--as a place to stay in order to get an early morning flight out of the airport.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodbridge, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointed...\u201d", "Author": "twn030577", "ReviewID": "UR126185238", "Content": "Reviewer mjg187 review was dead on! First I must say the staff and front desk are VERY polite, friendly, and helpful. Now for the disappointment....this hotel is older and has gone thru some renovations. It appears most of the money went to decorating the lobby which was very nice but not the actual rooms. The overall appearance of the room is not bad but just not Crown Plaza standards-appeared a little dated. Carpet & drapes are old and stained, bathroom needs a over-haul very old with cracked floor tiles. Toilet was rocky and stained. TV is extremely OLD and big. Horrible picture with static and limited channels. Lighting in the room is very dim. The meals in the Cafe are quite expensive. Breakfast should be included with room rates as this is a priority club property. Continental Breakfast was $14.95 if I recall and not worth it. A bowl of oatmeal and a cup of tea was almost $8 and dont forget the 15% surcharge (not gratuity). When asked why was there a 15% charge, waiter stated it was the hotels service fee not gratuity. This fee is usually charged for room service not dining in. As the other reviewer pointed out the key issue; safety assurance but quite annoying. You needed the key for everything however it deactivated almost after every use. They fitness room was a joke. It's a very small room with poor air circulation/ventilation. 2-3 treadmills, 1-eliptical and 1-seated bike/pedal machine. There are no weight machines or even hand weights. Overall this hotel is ok for short 2-3 day stays. This definitely not a 3.5-4 star hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNext time I will look elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "mjg187", "ReviewID": "UR126141967", "Content": "Like others have said, this hotel is acceptable; however, it is below standard as far as the Crowne brand is concerned. I travel for a living and stay in many, many hotels; as a result, I bounce between being a Gold & Platinum Priority Club member. So where to begin: ***The rooms are small ***TV outdated (no HD) and few channel choices ***No fridge/ microwave ***No ability to open windows in room (no fresh air) ***Internet is painfully slow, so good luck if you're trying to actually accomplish work via the internet ***You need your room key to go anywhere in the hotel: elevator, laundry, gym, pool....you name it, don't go w/out your key or you're not getting in ***Speaking of the keys, they're electronic swipe cards (which is a good thing); but they lose the data with the change of the wind....so you're left heading back to the front desk to have them re-coded frequently Overall, this hotel is clean, and reasonably well maintained. It is suitable for a short stay (less than a week). My stay, unfortunately, was over a month and this is not an extended-stay type of hotel. Also, I typically don't have housekeeping in my room when I travel due to the problems that occur. Unfortunately, when your stay is longer than a few days, it's inevitable to need those services. Further validating my concerns about having people in your room while you're gone, I had an item stolen from my room during a housekeeping visit. It wasn't anything of significant value; but the principal of the matter should be of concern for guests. I realize this isn't a problem exclusive to this hotel (if you travel enough, you'll realize housekeeping is trouble anywhere you go).

When I checked in, I notified the staff when our friends would be arriving at the airport. They arrived at the hotel at 10:30 p.m., only to be told that their room was not ready. I know the reason; I saw the \"do not disturb\" sign on their room door. There was a steady stream of airline personnel, and their room, which we had booked and prepaid more than one month ago, had been rented out. I heard the person in their room leaving at about 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. So the hotel had actually rented out the room twice during an overlapping time period. Our friends had been up for 24 hours in transit, and were forced to sit in the bar for an hour waiting for their room to be readied. The Crowne Plaza bar had only three bottles of any imported beer left, and these were served without a glass; we drank from the bottle. Then the bar attendant called our friends' room at 12:30 a.m., when they were finally asleep, to ask them come down to the desk and leave a credit card for the bar bill. The reason that they had not done so was that the personnle at the desk were busy dealing with quite a few other late arrivals, all of whom were irate at having been informed that their rooms were not ready either. In the morning as we were leaving, we heard other guests complaining that the hot water had run out (I have seen this mentioned in two reviews for this hotel across two web sites. so it evidently was not an isolated problem). To add insult to injury, when we looked at the charge on our credit card, we had been OVERCHARGED for the room. We have called twice since then to discuss the hotel charges, as we have written receipts with the guaranteed rates prnted with our confirmation; this is why we prepaid in the first place); the first time the billing person was not there, and the second time the person tried to blow us off, saying that these were parking and bar charges (those were placed on separate credit cards, for which we have receipts as well); it was stated that she would have to consult with another person and would call us back; we have not received a call back yet, so the matter is still unresolved, and the billing person basically was argumentative rather than fixing the situation for which we have written documentation.Finally, before leaving the hotel, I asked to speak to the manager about my concerns, and was told that he was in a meeting indefinitely.

No big deal because we were only there for one night. My two biggest problems with this hotel were the cost of parking and the rude receptionists at check-out. Okay, after driving almost 11 hours to Miami, we got to the hotel around 10pm. We had to pay $13.00 to park literally in the back of the hotel where there is barely any lighting and no entrance door. We had to walk all the way around the building with all of our luggage. Once we were completely inside the hotel, a bellhop had the nerve to ask if we needed help getting our things to the room. We get to the room and I was unimpressed. It was clean but it was just average. I've stayed in Super 8 Motels nicer than that. We ordered room service since we didn't stop for dinner and were told it would be about 20-25 minutes for our personal pepperoni pizzas. Well after 35 minutes, we called downstairs and were told it would be another 10-15 minutes. By this time, it was almost midnight. Once the pizzas got there they had mushrooms and sausage on them! I'm not sure how you get mushrooms and sausage from 2 pepperoni pizzas! Needless to say we sent them back and went to bed hungry. We woke up, showered and decided not to eat in the hotel restaurant because breakfast was ridiculously priced just like parking. They wanted $11.00 for a cold buffet, which included fruit, pastries and yogurt. It was an additional $13.00 or more for hot food such as omelets, bacon, etc. That didn't include your drink! Are you kidding me?! After paying $110.00 for the room, you want me to pay about $25.00 per person for mediocre breakfast? We went to the Burger King down the road from the ship dock. But before we left the hotel, I had the displeasure of talking to the check-out receptionists. They were both rude and unprofessional to say the least. I listened to how they talked to the other customers on the phone and the people ahead of me in line. It was unacceptable. I'm not sure how long I waited to be helped before stepping up to the counter and asking when can I be checked out (they kept looking at me but not helping me), but when I did, the young man said \"oh, I guess I can do that.\" Idiot! He was short with me and not helpful at all. My anger with my stay got me so preoccupied that I left my toiletry bag sitting right on the counter and walked out of the hotel without realizing it. Their service was so bad that they didn't even call me back to let me know that I'd left it. I didn't realize it until I was aboard my cruise ship heading towards Cozumel. I was livid. When I called the hotel, the receptionist said in a nonchalant voice, \"oh yeah, it's here.\" Nice! When I returned to the hotel to get my toiletry bag after my cruise, my bottle of lotion was missing. How do you like that?! That hotel makes me never want to stay in any Crowne Plaza ever again!

Our free shuttle to the hotel picked us up timely and was a very nice addition to our trip. We had no trouble checking in, however the very second we got onto the floor of our seven rooms we were hushed by a very rude guest. Yes, it was only a guest, but she had every right to hush our loud, rowdy group. You see, the hotel had put us on the quiet floor. We immediately went down & complained & were given rooms in different parts of the hotel. Our rooms were no longer together, but we did have one room that had a sliding glass door to the pool deck, so our group used this room all day & only slept in the other rooms. Now, back to the quiet floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At first were upset about it. But then, we went to dinner and saw all of the airline employees. Of course these people need a quiet floor. They have either already been flying all different hours or will be very soon. One thing that I have to say is anywhere near an airport where there are tons of airline personnel staying is the place you want to stay. These people stay all over the world & know the good, the bad and the ugly. This made us even more comfortable staying here. If you plan on using their sauna, heat it up well in advance. Unless someone has just been in it, you have to heat it up from pretty much room temperature which takes a while. The pool area is beautiful. It looks exactly as in the pictures; lots of cabanas for those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be in the sun, lots of lounges & pristinely clean water. Try to get a room with a sliding glass door to the pool. Besides the obvious, it also allows you to move around the hotel much easier. You can access different doors right from the pool deck without the hassle of walking the hallways. The pool deck is on the second floor, so it would be quite difficult I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine for someone to access your sliding door. There was, however, three different ways to lock our sliding door.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t order room service having only stayed here one night, but we did go to the bar & order takeout. It took forever to be served to us, but the portions were nice & the food tasted great. Know that they add full gratuity no matter if you have twenty meals, one order of fries or drinks. All in all, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this hotel to just about anyone. It was comfortable and welcoming. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen the underbelly of a plane and want to, stay here.

Like other reviewers have stated the airport is 5 minutes away from this hotel and the hotel is DIRECTLY in the path of one of the runaways....meaning that every 10 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week a plane is flying within 1000 feet above the hotel (no exaggeration). This means that you will not get a peaceful and relaxing experience anywhere outside this hotel, especially in the pool area which is located on the 2nd floor and is on the side where the planes make their approach to Miami International. The rooms are medicore at best. Not the cleaniest and not the dirtest I've stayed at. They are basic and the minimum you would expect. Now the service is where this hotel really falls short. If I had to sum it up in one word that word would be GARBAGE. We chose this hotel because we were told that it provided a shuttle to a hospital in the area free of charge. We further confirmed this via the hospitals web site, so we figured that with the hotel saying that they provided this service and it being on the hospitals web site we were covered. This was not the case and the hotel told us too bad and offered nothing to compensate us for the extra time and money we spent for their mistake. When we first learned that there was no shuttle to the hospital as promised via by their regional booking office, which was the number listed on there website for the hotel, when we made our reservations. It took 45 minutes of waiting to talk to the manager - basically they forgot about us sitting there waiting. The front desk person disappeared and then was talking to a \"friend\" when I interrupted and asked where the manager was for a second time - no apology for my wait. Finally, I was able to explain the situation to the manager who said they did not offer that service and wanted to know to with whom I had made my reservations with. Bottom line is I made them a month earlier and could not say exactly who I talked to and which number I called. He checked and said I had called the regional reservation center to make my reservation....my though was \"so what\" and \"why does that matter?\" The night manager said that because I could not tell him who I spoke with there was nothing he could do, but talk to the general manager and see if they could provide transportion or compensate us in some way. Neither of things happened and Crowne Plaza could have cared less. We had to take a cab - $60 out of pocket round trip. I could have stayed at dozen similarly priced hotels with a free airport shuttle all much closer hospital (one that offers access to a $1 train ride right to the hospital) and told the manager the same. He agreed with me, but said there was nothing he could do but talk with the general manager. Further, when we were working with the hotel to try to find a solution they got back to us after it was too late. For example, when our appointment was for 3:30 pm the following day and the night manager said he would have some contact us during the day before the appointment to let us know whether transportion could be provided They did not. When we returned after our appointment there was a message on our phone stating that hotel had not offered this service for at least 2 years, so there NOTHING THEY COULD DO. Ahh, I had a suggestion..... how about knock some money off our hotel bill for your mistake!!!!!!! Of course I found out they were giving the pilots staying at the hotel a ride to their training around the same time we needed a ride to the hospital, but I guess we were out of luck. Nice. On a side note the breakfast buffet was a complete rip-off at $30 for two of us - I mean we were at the airport not staying on SoBe. The service was lousy, the table dirty, the buffet average at best. This was the only meal we at the hotel for obvious reasons. Besides being close to the airport this hotel has nothing to offer and there are plenty of other hotels close by that I'm positive are much better. Crowne Plaza Miami, and for that matter all Crowne Plazas and their related companies, are off my list. In my opinion they did nothing to fix their mistake and communicaton with us was terrible.

We stayed there for a few days to get away and relax by the pool. Not happening. First, the planes fly what feels like right over your head non-stop. They are very loud and very close. The pool temperature was so cold and the wirlpool temperature was so hot you could not get in either one. We took a break for lunch in the cafe. We ordered ice tea but I am still not sure what we got. It was awful! Our other choices were coke, sprite or water. Nice selection. My friend ordered the veggie burger with grilled veggies on top. Uh huh....just grilled veggies on a roll is what they call a veggie burger. If you want to go anywhere in this hotel you have to have your key out to do anything like use the elevator or open any door. This is good for security but they were hard to use and very inconvenient. We stayed on the quiet zone floor (no children). Again another joke. We woke up in the middle of the night with kids running up and down the hall banging on doors. I'm surprised they didn't trip over the dirty plates from room service laying all over the hallways all of the time. The bedding is all white and shows every mark. Our blanket had stains all over it. They may want to think about losing the white bedding or actually changing the blankets. Do not take the shuttle to the Dolphin Mall unless you have an hour to kill. We got on and thought we would go to the mall. Yes...eventually. The shuttle stops at every hotel on the way. The mall is less than 5 miles away and it took over a hour to get there. I guess this would be ok to stay for a night being so close to the airport but don't stay here for any other reason.

The hotel is situated fairly close to the airport and Little Havana, in a less than desirable area. It is conviently located to Coral Gables, however the area itself does not have much to offer. The hotel is located on a busy road, and their parking area was free but unmaned. It looked as if it used to be secure parking with an attendant, but now anyone can come and go from the lot. We booked a room on the \"executive/club level\" which was located in a quiet zone, which promised no kids, large groups and encouraged guests to not slam their doors or be very loud. Their \"executive room\" was the size of a normal two double bed room with a small chair and desk. It was nothing spectuacular and lacked the warm, clean feeling that many 3 star hotels have. The rug had many wear and dirty spots on it and felt a little grimy to walk on. There were a few obvious stains on some of the bedding as well. The bathroom was less than desirable, more on par with a 1 1/2 to 2 star hotel. The room description on their website mentioned bathrobes and a sleeper sofa or comfortable chair, but our room lacked both of these. However, I must comment on their beds, which were recently upgraded to pillow top matresses with new plush bedding - they were extremely comforable and inviting. And, they provided sleep kits, which included sheet spray, sleep eye masks and ear plugs, which was a nice touch. The lobby, restaraunt and bar of the hotel were pretty much deserted and lacked a warm or inviting feeling. It seems like this hotel is mostly used by people traveling on airlines or cruises, and has the just passing through area. Because of the lack of security in the parking lot, you must use your key to access the room floors which was nice, but made us wonder about how safe the area was. Another dissappointment was that we were awoken at 11:45 pm by a screaming kid in the hallway. When I opened the door to see what was going on, the kid and his parents were entering into a room down the hallway with luggage, which means that the hotel did not abide by their quiet room rules, as promised. Quite disturbing considering they charge an extra $20 per night for the assurance of a quiet night's sleep. My exam was in the Marriott down the street and their lobby was warm and inviting. Although I did not see the rooms, I would book at the Marriot if I had to return to the area.

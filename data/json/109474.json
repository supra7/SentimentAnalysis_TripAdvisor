Makes us think that they're trying to cover up something?? The smell is too overwhelming!! It's as though they're updating because there are beautiful furnitures & fixtures, but tur walls, door frames, doors & carpet are in terrible shape so it almost seems like a waste? The walls are the thinnest that I have ever experienced... We heard every movement and voice in the hallway as well as every step taken in the room above us. The desk clerk was incredibly nice and accommodating.

The staff were really friendly, the rooms were very clean, the pool was a great place to cool off during the 106 F days! Also, the location is great, as it is just off of the LBJ Freeway. There are 6 good restaurants all within walking distance (Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Whiskers Catfish Buffet, Jack-in-the-Box, and our favorite - Cheddars, which is just out the back door of the hotel!) I would certainly stay there again if we were in Dallas! Also, the Allen Outlet mall was 15 minutes away!

The service was first-rate - every worker has a nice greeting for you. The rooms are nicely appointed, are very clean, and the beds were so comfortable. And the complimentary touches were great - a free american hot buffet breakfast awaits you when you get up - eggs, bacon, cereal, bagels, and fruit - and you even get free drinks at happy hour along with hot appetizers. The price was excellent. And the location was surrounded by major restuarant chains within walking distance , close to anything you'd need to get to. I would definitely come back.

The place was convenient to everything (including our HQ). It was kept immaculately clean. The staff was outstanding to deal with. I felt like I was in a 5 star resort. My room was quiet and comfortable. The hotel even arranged to have us picked up by limo (on their dime) at our HQ since their shuttle stopped service at 6pm. And on the day we were leaving our Yellow Checker Shuttle never showed up to take us to the airport. On a last second request the manager allowed one of the staff to take us 17 miles to DFW without charge! We still tipped the driver well for saving our butts and getting us to DFW on time.

The breakfast was also ok. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold. It was a decent selection for that type of breakfast service and someone was on hand to keep it stocked and tidy. The room was clean and I had no problems with it. The couch in my room which was a suite was a bit outdated but not a problem for me. I did not have a problem with noise either. The MAIN problem was the STALE smell. Obviously there are smokers being allowed to smoke in the nonsmoking rooms and nothing is being done about it. Thist was clear once I stepped off the elevator. This was too bad. Get rid of the smell and people will come. For now, if you are not a smoker and cannot stand the smell....go somewhere else.

Gorgeous lobby, gorgeous exterior, beautiful greenery in the pool area -The rooms are clean, woohoo! -There is a pool and a jacuzzi, and they're both completely usable -There is a small fitness center -Pool table in the lobby! -One restaurant, and a gift shop! Cons: -Clueless front desk staff, so unhelpful, didn't know anything about public transportation or nearby services. Also, just interacted weirdly: \"You can look it up online but I know for a fact there's nothing available.\" Why would I look something up online that you know for a fact won't be helpful? Confused. -No explanation of services - I had no idea there was a rental car shop on site until they were closed for the weekend. I completely would've gone before they closed, had I known! -Paid internet in the room (not even wireless), $11.95 for 24 hours. Of course I just went for the free wifi in the lobby. But this is a Doubletree/Hilton - do you really need to nickel and dime your customers? -Police officers standing guard outside a room on our floor. \"Is everything OK?\" \"Why, are you scared?\" \"Um, should I be?\" \"Nah\" -Our room smelled like weed every time a room down the hall lit up. -The area outside the hotel is scary scary scary. Taxis are essential, and most of the drivers yell at you for using cards even though there's nothing nearby. More cons, but petty: -No spa in the hotel, just a hair salon run by 2 people who don't post a sign when they decide to leave the shop during their normal business hours. Back to unhelpful front desk - \"Oh I don't know when they'll be back. It's not part of the hotel, so, I don't know.\" \"Is there a spa nearby?\" \"Uh, yeah there's one at another hotel.\" \"Is it walkable?\" \"About 20 minutes away by car.\" -All the clocks in the room were set to different times. Weird? -Lame fitness center -Insanely rude bartender at the restaurant. Wouldn't even hear my drink order until the third time I asked, at which point he yelled \"ID\" and walked away. I left my ID on the bar, and he came back and said \"OK. What do you want.\" The food's not awesome, the prices are sky high, but what can you do when it's the only thing there. 3 stars for the clean hotel.

But Not This Time\u201d", "Author": "Miatt", "ReviewID": "UR122832690", "Content": "I usually love staying at Double Tree. They are clean, have good service and usually decently priced. Unfortunately, the Double Tree in San Pedro falls way below any Double Tree I have ever stayed at. We were staying here one night before a cruise the next day and lets just say I am happy it was only one night... I arrived at 3 PM, well 2:55 and went to check in. They told me my room was not ready yet, but she just needed to call housekeeping and it would only be a minute. I walked around the lobby for a second and was quickly called back to the front by the front desk agent. She told me it would be another 45 minutes to an hour before my room was ready, even though check-in time was at 3. She then told me I was welcome to use the restaurant... Strike 1: No apology, no attempting to make it better by offering a drink coupon or anything, just sent me in the direction of the restaurant. It would have been really easy for me to write a positive review if she had just apologized, that at least shows me that she cares. But I got nothing. Exhausted from a 9 hour drive, we decided we would eat lunch in the restaurant. Normally I don't like to eat in hotel restaurants because they are over priced and usually not very good, but we did not want to drive anywhere and decided we would give it a shot. Strike 2: The food and service at their restaurant is awful! For starters there was only 3 other people sitting there and there were 3 people serving. That would tell me each person would be responsible for one table and service should be quick. Oh was I wrong. We waited about 15 minutes just to be offered anything to drink and that was followed with a \"What do you want??\" We must have been inconveniencing her because she clearly didn't want to deal with us. 30 minutes later when we finally got the food it was so disgusting that we barely ate any of it because we thought we might throw up. We just wanted to get to our room, but we still had to wait. After our experience at the restaurant we went back to the front and I told the guy that we needed to get into our room. He looked at me like I was an idiot and asked what our room number was. I told him we didn't have one yet, which seemed to confuse him. Another 5 minutes went by of him fiddling around with the computer and finally we got our keys. Strike 3: I was never recognized as being a Honors Gold Member, I was never given any information about the hotel or about breakfast (which I am supposed to get for free as a benefit of being an Honors member) and I was still never given an apology. We got up to the room, and the room was clean and it seemed fine. My only complaint with the room is all of the dirty sheets (surely from the people the night before) sitting in the hall right in front of my door. How nice. When we got in the room it was very warm, so we turned the A/C down a couple notches and left to get a couple last minute things for our cruise the next morning. When we got back our room was freezing. So we turned the A/C (not the heat) up just a little. Next thing we knew it was super hot again, so back to turning it down. This went on all night and we ended up waking up for good at 5am because we could not tolerate it anymore. There was no happy medium. It was either hot or freezing cold. The hotel will allow you to arrange transportation to the port, but with how everything else had gone so far, we got a ride from family who was coming in that morning to cruise with us. We were able to leave our car parked at the hotel for the whole cruise, and honestly, that is the only reason I gave this hotel 2 stars instead of one. A couple other things to keep in mind. There are tons of kids at this hotel cruising with their families and it is like staying at a Chuck-E-Cheese. The entire night there were kids running up and down the halls, slamming doors and being extremely annoying. No, this is not the hotel's fault, but I still feel they should have done something about this. Also there is no wireless internet in the rooms. They have wired, but lets be honest, who uses wired anymore? In this day and age you use tablets or smart phones, and I'm pretty sure no one has an ethernet cord in their phone. In conclusion, this hotel is very close to the port, but there are other hotels close by as well. Even if you are an Honors member like me and want to stay at a Hilton because you want to use your points, or get points... Don't. I stayed there because I was able to use my points, so basically it was free, but I am not happy that I did. I wish I had saved my points and stayed elsewhere because this was not a good use of my points.

After a good night sleep we decided to enjoy the hotels breakfast buffet. Spendy!! The selection was good and the service was better. While we were having breakfast, Tommy, the hotel manager, stopped by and introduced himself (when was the last time that happened to you?). After breakfast the hotel shuttle delivered us to the ship and when we got back they picked us up and dropped us off at our car. There were two things I was not happy about.

You are paying for location. It is very close to the Port of Los Angeles, so if you are going on a Disney or Carnival Cruise you are literally minutes away. The location next to marina is nice for walking and the views, but the amenities are lacking for the price of the rooms. For example, there is no fridge in the room (you can rent one for an extra cost), no free breakfast, no included internet access. There is internet access in the rooms...if you pay for it, and if you have a cable to access it. There is no wi-fi in the rooms at all. There is wi-fi in the main lobby area, but there are no quiet spots due to the fact that the restaurant and bar are open to and part of the lobby. When we were there some huge party was going on and it was very loud in the lobby area. I was trying to do some work because all I had was my tablet (so I could only access wi-fi) and I finally gave up and went upstairs around midnight, and the party was still going strong. Yeah, it was a Friday night, but it was disappointing that there were no quiet areas to work in. The pool was clean, but frigid. My kids, who love to swim, spent about 20 minutes in the water and then had to get out because they were freezing. The ice cold water is probably really nice in August, but not so great at the end of October. Our room was nice and clean, so were the linens. The bed was pretty comfortable. The bathroom had a sliding door on it, and no lock. This didn't bother us but might both some people. There is also no fan in the bathroom, so it gets very steamy and the mirror foggy, and you have to wait for it to clear. The door to the hotel room had a slow-closing mechanism on it to prevent the door from slamming shut, but it was a total pain because you either had to wait for it to close totally, or you had to manhandle it closed. If you don't wait, your door is wide open and anyone can just walk in, and if someone was trying to push their way through the door you would not be able to close it quickly. I don't think this is very safe, especially for women traveling alone. This hotel is also very spread out, so you will be doing a lot of walking to get to your room depending on where it is located. The final thing to be aware of it that since this hotel is so close to the port, if you like to sleep with the window open you will hear a constant (about every 90 seconds) horn blowing. I am not sure what it was, but it was constant. And it seemed to increase in frequency about 6:30 am. You can't really hear it when the windows are closed, though. Our room was also overlooking the marina, so maybe it wasn't as noticable on the other side of the hotel. If you want to be close to the Port, you can't beat the location. But you won't get as much for your money as you would at another hotel. You can find packages online that will add to what you get for your money (such as comp. breakfast, etc.), so I would recommend searching these out if you plan on booking here.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salinas", "Title": "\u201cNo in-room wifi :(\u201d", "Author": "David L", "ReviewID": "UR121931043", "Content": "We like this place. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly. It's great to be at the marina even if you're not into sailing. They offer wifi in the lobbey but internet in the room is ethernet cable only! The cable is only 3 feet long so you are essentially tethered to the desk area. We had 2 rooms (which were across the hall even though we pre-requested adjoining rooms and the hotel wasn't that busy -- there are adjoining rooms but they had booked one of the pair to someone else -- I don't think they read the requests ahead of time on rooms booked on interenet). We were not able to access the internet in either room without help from the engineer due to trouble with their outdated tangle of cable wires. The cost was escessive-- $11.95/day, considering that more and more places are offering it free. And if you want access in both rooms, there is an etra $11.95 fee. So we took turns with our single short cable connection. My daughters couldn't use their tablet computor or wifi-ready ipod. Also, beware of the alarm clocks that are set for 4:00 in the morning. We couldn't figure out how to tun off alarm so the second night we unplugged the f-ing thing. Did you know that some hotel alarm clocks run on batteries when unplugged? We didn't.

Ok, yes, there is one.. Can't say it affects me personally, but here you go.. On cruise turnaround days the hotel is very busy.. The only significant impacts I have noticed of this are that a) the pool area can get a little crowded (as opposed to my being there on my own, some days) and b) there can be a wait for your room on check in on these days as, often, they are turning around a large proportion of the rooms in the hotel (as a set of guests depart the hotel to check on to their cruises, a new set arrives from the recently docked ship)... They work very hard, from what I can see, to minimise impacts from this, but they are clear about their check in times.. If you arrive early, they will try and help, but you may also be waiting.. I have seen many folks trying to check in pretty early and, well, when they are turning 'round som many rooms, that will lead to the inevitable, I'm afraid..

Unfortunately, that isn't the case, at least at this property. We were staying one night before a cruise and for that purpose the location is nice with beautiful views of a marina. There really isn't anything within walking distance, but the hotel shuttle will take you anywhere within 5 miles, so that gives you some options even if you don't have a car. The staff overall was very nice, but there seems to be a lack of training. Everyone does seem to try hard to be pleasant, which is a definite plus these days. I did have to wait while the valet guys rolled each other around on the luggage carts though. They could have easily hit someone coming out of the front door of the hotel....I'm sure management would be horrified if they saw this going on. Once I got their attention they were good about signing us up for the port shuttle the next morning. We arrived at 2pm and our room wasn't ready (check-in is 4pm), which we understand. We were told that the front desk would call us when the room was ready, which never happened. If you aren't going to follow through, don't offer to do it. They did offer to store our luggage and that worked out fine. We wandered around the marina and had lunch in the hotel's restaurant to kill time, so it wasn't a big deal. The food in the restaurant is very good, they offer a wide selection (although they were out of things at dinner), and the prices are reasonable for a hotel. The service was good at lunch, but very poor at dinner...we were never offered drinks other than water and the check was dropped off without asking if we wanted dessert. We received our Gold Hilton Honors benefits with room upgraded to marina view even though we were staying on points, which was nice. I expect to get them, but not necessarily without asking. Everything was in order and properly presented at check-in. Now for the huge flaw where this property really falls on its face. The place is filthy. Honestly, I've stayed in $50 motels that were cleaner than this hotel. I was shocked and I'm not very picky. All of the furniture in the lobby was either dirty, extremely worn, or both. There was trash on the floor, the carpets were dirty and needed vacuuming, and there were paper towels strewn all over the public restroom. There is a pool table in the lobby that has a light fixture over it that had two burned out bulbs and a missing shade. Really tacky. Take it out if you can't fix it. The room itself (room 357), while fairly spacious, was not properly cleaned by any stretch of the imagination. The bathroom floor was disgusting and had not been mopped because it had small chunks of dirt still on it. The bottom of the bathtub needed to be scrubbed, the shower curtain rod was about to fall down, the electrical outlet and light switch were very dirty, and the back of the door had a huge black smudge that looked like mold from inside the wall pocket it slides into. In the room, one of the beds was so rumpled it looked like all they did was remake a slept-in bed (I convinced myself it was just wrinkled), there were cobwebs floating around on the ceiling above the desk, the floor lamp had huge yellow stains on the shade, the lamp by the bed had something spewed up the inside, and the internet cable on the desk was broken so it wouldn't clip into the computer (I bring my own anyway, but I shouldn't have to). The carpet looked clean enough except for some crumbs indicating it hadn't been vacuumed. The upholstered chair had crumbs all over it and the desk chair was filthy. Note that the marina view rooms have the possibility of noise from people walking/talking along the walkway and it can be noisy if there is a party going on at the adjacent yacht club. This hotel has a lot of potenial, but I'm sorry to say it isn't living up to it. I'm sure it gets a lot of rough traffic with all the kids embarking Disney cruises, but that's no excuse for poor housekeeping. I would say that overall the noise level here is acceptable even with the kids running around. The old A/C unit was very quiet and worked properly. There is no way I'd pay the regular rates for this hotel. I might stay here again using points or with an extremely discounted rate under the same circumstances. All in all it was tolerable and the staff was nice, but wouldn't cut it if you are paying full price.

We took the Super Shuttle from the airport to the hotel and arrived before the 4:00 p.m. check in. The hotel locked our luggage in a storage area so we were free to sit outside on their patio to have food and drinks. The waiter was very friendly and provided great service. After 4:00 p.m. we asked the front desk if we could check in but were told we should come back in about 10-15 minutes. This happened 2 more times. Each time the front desk had to call housekeeping to see if the room was ready. Finally at 4:45 p.m. we were able to check in. I had reminded the front desk we had a free breakfast and they brought our coupons up to the room later. We signed up for the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle the following morning to take us to the cruise port which really worked out well.

Must pay forget how much but something in are of $12 or some such. They do provide FREE wireless in lobby. Don't understand why they do this considering that in today's world even flop houses pretty much offer free internet now. Consider that room stay is NOT inexpensive in this hotel internet should be FREE, wireless, and in room!!! Still it would not preclude me staying there again. Excellent choice for cruise from San Pedro cruise terminal ( NOT Long Beach one ). Room service excellent as well for morning again reasonably priced as such things go. Coffee for two, bagel, fruit plate all excellent $20, Again for hotel room service reasonable.

We decided to do a pre-cruise stay for our RCCL cruise leaving the 9th. We drove up from San diego and decided to make an outing of it and went to see the Aquarium of the pacific (outstanding! buy your tickets online and save $5.00 a person) and the surrounding marina area (also great). We also had lunch at a near by restaurant withing walking distance of the aquarium and the prices were reasonable.There are plenty of shops to see if you are into that and great areas for walking and lots of restaurants and you can get a good view of the Queen mary. Well we had a full afternoon and headed back to the hotel. We reserved the \"park and cruise\" package that included accomodations, parking for the week, champagne or cider and a breakfast buffett for two the following morning. Check in was quick and friendly and they gave us warm chocolate chip cookies which we saved for later. The front desk asked us to check in with the bell desk to arange for what time we would like to depart for the ship. The bell desk just asked what time we would like because they had scheduled times to depart and the just asked how many pieces of luggage that we had and said what time to meet in the lobby. That was it and took all of about two minutes. Our room was a king size non-smoking ground floor facing the marina which was very nice. The room was clean and was large enough. The bedding was crisp and clean and there were plenty of pillows. the bathroom had plenty of towels and the ammenities were neutrogena, including sunscreen (nice touch, for use on shore excursions) and face wash. We decide to walk around the marina and the hotel is next to a yacht club with plenty of nice boats, the grounds were well kept and we felt very safe in the area. When we returned to the room they had delivered the champagne on ice with glasses (more on that later). By that time it was time for dinner and you could eat at the hotel but we decide to ask the bell desk person what was in the area and he mentioned a good seafood restaurant. The hotel will shuttle you for free to places in the immediate area and then you just call up the number on the card the bellman gives you and they come and pick you up. It is a very nice service and my Wife and I enjoyed a nice dinner at the 22nd street pier (thanks Paul!!). What a perfect way to end a very full and enjoyable day. The bed was very comfortable and there was nothing that hampered a good nights sleep. In the morning after having coffee (Wolfgang pucks complimentary in the room) we decided to go to the buffett. I was not large but had just about everything you might want for breakfast and you could always order from the menu. They had hot and cold cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, muffins, juices, tea, coffee. We thought it was good and it was included in the package. By itself I think it was 18.00 per person, very convienient. Back to the champagne..we decided not to open it on arrival and instead make our own mimosas with some o.j. from the buffett. Another good memoy and nice way to get primed for a cruise ship departure! With the mimosas all gone we gathered our belongings and went to the lobby which is large and allows ample room for people to spread out with luggage etc. it is also a nice time to chat with other cruisers who are going to be on your ship. The shuttle driver loaded our luggage at the designated time and we were at the cruise ship terminal in about 10 minutes. the driver unloaded our luggage which went right to the cruise lines luggage handler and away we went to check in. Over all a very good pre-cruise adventure.

Excellent choice. We had a lovely room with a beautiful view of the wharf and sailboats and a lovely sunset. I left the curtains open when we went to bed because the lights and boats were so pretty. Room was pretty, but the upholstery fabrics were not as expensive and nice as some of the other Doubletree's I have been in recently. We were tired and ate dinner at the restaurant, pretty good not to die for. Breakfast was very nice and the dinig room has the same lovely views of the wharf and all the sailboats. Tip: free internet in the lobby. Too bad I did not notice it until the last day. The hotel has a shuttle to take you to the cruise ship harbor, but best to reserve a time the night before. The renovations others have written about must have been completed by the time we got there because everything was beautiful and new looking. I would stay here again.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland", "Title": "\u201cThe Charm Is Back ----- AWESOME\u201d", "Author": "rubhed", "ReviewID": "UR6183338", "Content": "Hello, If you read my review one year ago, I said I would probably never go back to this hotel even though we had been going there for years. Allot can change in a year and did! I looked all around for a hotel in the long beach area but I i could not get the double tree out of my head. So I looked on tripadvisor and noticed some users say that there was a massive renovation. I called the hotel and they said the renovation is almost complete. Wow I thought. So I booked the hotel 3 nights before our cruise. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was that the staff gives you warm fresh made chocolate chip cookies upon check in. The restaurant has been updated and looks great. The little gift shop has not changed and i guess thats a good thing. The carpet thoughout the hotel has been changed. The rooms have been completely updated with featherbeds and nice neutural colors thoughout the room. Everything about the rooms are first class. The rooms with marine views are great , the windows are large and completely open. Room service is prompt and resonable. I would come to this hotel for a weekend just to get away. You can't beat the location if you want a quiet relaxing hotel.The one thing you should know is that if you want to go anywhere from this hotel you will need a car. If you are coming from the Long Beach Airport it costs $35 to get to this hotel via taxi or van. The hotel has a free shuttle to the ship if you are taking a cruise. The hotel sits on a marina about 8 miles away from long beach and any activities, so rent a car if you want to do anything outside of the hotel. I mean anything. To wrap it up the hotel is in one word Awesome. I will stay there again when we cruise next year and I might make a few trips there before then. It is a home away from home. At the same time you are quite aways from Long Beach. So if you want want a great relaxing hotel out of the hustle and bussle of the big city this hotel is for you.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cCindarella at the ball!!!\u201d", "Author": "bitybit", "ReviewID": "UR5764003", "Content": "My wife & I stayed here last summer and were quite hesitant to come back this time around. The place was in shambles last year, horrible room conditions, the staff was very rude & discurteous, etc. It was like night & day this time...the Hotel has just completed an $8.5 million dollar renovation complete with the new \"Sweet Dreams\" bed package, free internet in the Business Center, all new Teak patio furniture and the entire building is getting painted as well. They converted to Doubletree as of August 1st. The rooms are by far the best in the market.....and I feel they even rival some of the best Hotels in Long Beach just over the bridge. The shuttle to the cruise terminals was convenient & affordable and the Bellman were very accomodating. The food was incredible as well. They have this Seafood Buffet every Friday night on the patio overlooking the Marina, the view was breathtaking. We will definitely be back and tell everyone we know about the new Doubletree Hotel - San Pedro.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d81761-Reviews-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_San_Pedro-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$147 - $219*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2800 Via Cabrillo Marina</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90731</span></span> (Formerly Marina Hotel Port of Los Angeles/San Pedro)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "81761", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d6/b4/d6b460e2a001308ee7abed5d7db1ccec5large.jpg"}}

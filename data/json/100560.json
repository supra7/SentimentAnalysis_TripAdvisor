A note of caution, for patients who can't handle hills, it's best to take a cab or find some other way to get up there. Even so, it would be a very short cab ride so the fare would be low. The good news for walkers is, it's all downhill when you are done at Virginia Mason! Wife and I really enjoyed the Hilton. One of our favorite places, The Brooklyn Seafood, Steak, and Oyster House, is four blocks down the hill from the hotel. We had to stagger back up the hill to the Hilton after having consumed a memorable meal, but it was worth it! The hotel was fine, it seemed there were staffpersons everywhere just waiting to help you with questions, etc. Very helpful and courteous. Our room was clean and quiet, though as noted elsewhere the bathroom seemed a bit small. We received our HHonors amenities and even a champagne and chocolate gift in honor of our wedding anniversary.

One of the options was to book a room which gave us access to the Executive Lounge (room price was around $210 Canadian - internet and parking extra).

The service was fantastic - they were quick to bring us our own coffee pot and the staff was extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is undergoing some renovations (most seem complete) but they didn't interfere with our pleasant stay. Our only concern was that parking was at a premium.

On the surface, this Hilton looks fine: the lobby is decorated in traditional sophisticated tones. The rooms are large with modern furniture and nice flat screen TVs. The staff is super friendly. But once you start paying attention to anything beyond the gloss, this hotel loses stars quickly. First, the bathrooms are tiny. Like, so small that the door can't stay open because it runs into the show curtain. Considering that most of the furniture (the desk, the dresser) in the room was clearly too big for the space (pushed side-by side, with no space between them), I would have been willing to sacrifice a couple of feet in the bedroom and smaller furniture for a slightly bigger bathroom. The upstairs restaurant was closed for rooftop repairs, so breakfast was served in a large, windowless conference room that was eerily quiet. Okay, these things happen: repairs must me made, and they had to serve breakfast somewhere. But the food was awful and expensive. My Garden Scramble was overcooked and dry. My husband's french toast was better, but fairly gummy. And the two together cost $37. That was the amazing part -- they stick you in some large conference room with awful lighting and no ambiance, and don't think to reduce their prices at all. The next night we got a chocolate lava cake to take to our room. It was advertised as having a warm chocolate interior. And when we bit into it, it was cold, cold, cold. Okay, still delicious (it was chocolate, after all), but another example of how they just don't pay attention. The internet is expensive at $10.95/day. My husband and I have separate computers, so before paying for the internet we called downstairs to ask if the daily charge would cover both of our devices, and we were told yes. Then were charged twice, and were told it's because we used two devices. They did remove the extra charge for that one day, but said in the future it would be $10.95/device/day.

The woman at the front desk had me booked with a corner room, but when she saw how tall I was, she recommended the handicapped room, with the bigger bathroom. Try to get that room if they tell you that you have a corner room. One of my colleagues almost got stuck with a corner room.

There is an instruction card on the desk that tells you how to print there via a website called printspots.com, that will print to that printer. It came in handy for me when I wanted to print out several things. After you print your items, you go to the printer in the Business Center and type in the PIN you selected, and the items will print out for you whenever you want. You do not have do rush downstairs after you print out anything. The parking garage has a lot to be desired. Very tight corners, and tight spaces. I had rented a Dodge Charger, and I was a bit concerned. Just be wary of that. Hotel will get you for about $34 a day for in/out garage privileges. Also, make sure you know which floor you park your car on. I don't know how many times people walked off each floor to look for their car, and run back in the elevator, to go to the next floor! I was guilty of that too! Internet is $11 a day. Both wired and wireless worked fine from my room. On checkout, if you see a room charge on the last page of your bill called 'Shops,' don't be alarmed. That's the total of your Internet charges.

As others have noted, the entry is odd, but perfectly workable thanks to fast elevators, the rooms are a bit small, and the bathroom is cramped but fixable by removing a wall. Otherwise, the room was very nice, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet. It is a 10 minute walk from the train that serves the airport ($2.50 each way), and a short walk to almost anything you want in downtown Seattle. The positives: as a Gold member, I received free internet and free breakfast coupons for each day. I learned on my last day that the coupons can be applied to any meal, at a value of about $13 - something to keep in mind as I visit other Hiltons. So, my Gold level status saved me about $25 each day! In addition, they serve a fairly extensive and free evening snack buffet at the top level restaurant, which occasionally served as dinner. This helped offset a glass of wine or two with my \"dinner\". Service was superb, by everyone at the hotel. All staff were excellent, from the housekeeper who serviced my room in 15 minutes when I needed to get back early, to the restaurant servers, and the front desk. This is a very customer-oriented property. A little known trick for bad weather is that there is an indoor path to the convention center. The staff can provide instructions if you don't want to venture outside. The one negative surprise had to do with phone charges. I had planned to take a 4-hour telecon via the internet, but I had a problem with my computer. Since I wanted to use the hotel speakerphone, I looked for a rate card, but there was no rate information in the room. I called the front desk, but they also had no information. At their suggestion, I called their provider, Sprint, but got the usual automated menu system with little outlook for a live person. So, I direct dialed - BIG MISTAKE! After 45 minutes, I had accumulated a $172 bill - almost $4/minute -- you just can't find rates like that anymore for domestic long-distance. Usually, rates are under a $1/min. I was motivated to get my computer working and finished the call that way. Later, I got a call from the front desk apologizing for their lack of information, and they cut my charge in half. A nice offering, but still, these charges seem out of line. I am drafting a letter to the hotel manager - they need to post their rates and not put their employees in this awkward position.

My sister and I had booked a short 4-day Pacific Northwest cruise originating in Seattle, and wanted to use my free Hilton Honors room certificates for pre and post cruise overnight stays. When I went to make room reservations, I found out that the Hilton was about the only hotel in downtown Seattle where I could use the certificates and get a room with two beds. It all worked out for the best. The Hilton turned out to be comfortable and accommodating, and was within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Westlake Center, and the Transit Tunnel. The rooms were small, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found to be typical of downtown hotels in big cities, but clean and well stocked. A breakfast buffet (approx. $13) was served every morning on the top floor with a view of the bay. The front desk staff, bellmen, and concierge were very friendly and helpful. We had a few problems with the room we stayed in pre-cruise. The toilet had a small leak at the top near the handle where you flush, and the thermostat didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to work. We had to turn the temperature down to 64 degrees before we could get the humidity out of the room. The 2 lampshades/light fixtures between the beds were askew and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get them to stay upright. The lamp near the window had a similar problem and was bent. I reported the problems when we checked out the next morning. I would have reported the toilet leak and the thermostat problem the night before, but I got in late after a 4-hour flight and just wanted to go to sleep. The room we received post-cruise had no problems whatsoever. If you fly to Seattle and want to stay at the Hilton, I recommend taking the Grey Line Downtown Airporter that runs about every 20 minutes and drops you off and picks you up at the front door of the hotel.

Staff was very pleasant and helpful - when I checked in, the woman at the desk complimented my shirt. Another time I walked outside the hotel and stood there for a few moments with a map in my hand trying to figure out which way I needed to go and an employee from the desk actually came outside and asked me if I needed help with directions. I also had a problem with being double charged for my stay, which I wasn't aware of until I got home and saw it on my statement, but I called the hotel and left a message explaining the problem and within 15 minutes I received a call back apologizing for what happened and the double charge had been refunded.

Supposedly the taxi fare is $32 from the airport (as adverstised on the cab window), but none of my colleagues or I got that rate. Something about extra taxes due to the airport. Our fares all ranged from $38-45. The bellman at the Hilton were all very welcoming and friendly and the front desk was nice enough. I checked in at noon, well ahead of the 3pm check in time. The room was clean and fairly up-to-date. The downside was that the bathroom was very tiny. It was quite awkward getting in and out of the bathroom to close the door. Also, the hangers for the closet had the tiny hooks so they couldn't be used on a normal clothes rod in order to help combat theft. As a result of this, you couldn't hang your clothes just anywhere. The only place besides the closet was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door. This became quite annoying very quickly when getting ready. On my last night there, it was after 10 pm at night and I heard the sink make a funny gurgling noise. When I looked in there, it was full of brownish black water. I called the front desk and someone came up and had it fixed within half an hour. I don't know if this was an ongoing problem as my neighbor had the same problem that night, but the response was quick and was taken care of quickly. The location of this hotel can't be beat. We were two blocks away from the convention center, and about 5-6 blocks from Pike's Street Market. I walked down there 3 times during my stay. The walk down is all downhill, and the walk back can be quite a challenge depending on which way you come back. If you walk down University street (which the Hilton sits on), it will take you straight to Pier 57 where you'll find many restaurants. We ate at the Crab Pot one night where they have a crab boil and dump all the goods on the table for you to break open with a mallet.

I can now honestly say I do not intend to stay here again. In a nutshell, the level of service here stinks...badly. Here's a rundown of failings of this place (as experienced by us on the last trip) - Lineup of no less than 5 parties at checkin - with one person manning the counter - despite this being at a busy time ~3pm, and with no apology for the wait. - Very snarly front desk staff. Upon informing him that we had 2 reservations (for consecutive nights...one with points, the other at a pre-paid rate) he reacted with serious attitude, as if I was inconveniencing him and that it was MY fault the reservations weren't \"joined together\" in the system. He then informed me that our room key \"probably\" wouldn't work on the second day of our stay - which, as it turned out, it didn't. (My opinion - this is a 'technical' issue that front desk should be able to deal with very easily, without me having to be inconvenienced by returning to the front desk to obtain a new key) - In previous stays using Hilton points I was offered comp. upgrade to 'executive' floor - not this time (despite the hotel clearly not being full). - Cleanliness of room was NOT up to standard - hair in bathtub and bathroom floor, for example. - Unusual (and cramped) layout of bathroom. - Lobby bar staff were unattentive, despite there being only 3 other people in it at the time. Furthermore, we had to listen to her complaining loudly to another patron about how long she had been on duty. Food was dropped on our table with nary a word. - Finally, the pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00c3\u00a9sistance was the fire alarm going off at 7:15 Subday morning, and continuing for ~30min (staff did instruct people via the PA system to remain in their rooms). Upon checkout later that morning I inquired as to the problem, with no real answer, other than \"something went wrong\" (duh!) - nor any apology whatsoever, nor any inquiry about whether our stay was satisfactory, etc. My (and I assume MOST people's) typical guage on the level of service at a hotel is the willingness of staff to take care of the small things that might otherwise cause you irritation or inconvenience, staff's expression of appreciation for your patronage and their general level of courtesy and pleasantness. From my experience, the Hilton Seattle is seriously lacking in those respects.

Also if you drive in with you own car you have to park in their garage, no valet parking, and the garage is more expensive than most valet lots you'd run into.

There was nowhere for the taxi to pull into and no awning to keep rain off. There was no doorman. Just a door at the corner of the building.

I would rate the other Hiltons as \"Excellent\" First of all they charge you $9.95 a night to use the internet in your room. The free wireless internet is only available in the Executive Lounge (small converted guest room) or in the lobby. We went up to the Executive Lounge and it was comical.

Front desk personnel and management that I delt with have no customer service skills. My car was parked in the Hilton garage and my window was smashed out and my car was ransacked. Hilton Security simply left a business card on my smashed window and took the time to sweep the glass off of the ground. I discovered that Hilton Security knew that my car was broken into and let it sit there with a smashed out window for over two days! Did they notify me? NO! After a series of failures by Hilton staff I was put in touch with Seattle Hilton's Director of Security. I asked him why I wasn't notified that my car had been broken into.

This property is in a great location in downtown Seattle, in easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Pacific Place shopping, the Convention Center, and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is an older property, but the only way to guess that is due to the slightly smaller bedroom and bathroom sizes, along with the narrow corridors on the floor levels, along with the small number of rooms on each floor. All walls, tiles, linens and furnishings were clean and modern, presenting a nice decor. Bathrooms were equipped with Crabtree & Evelyn Le Source toiletries (my favorite!). Rooms start on floor 14 (which I was on) and run through floor 28, with the restaurant on the 29th floor. Three elevators provided smooth and speedy service. Another plus - to access any guest floor, and room key was required, helping make a single traveler feel safe. The meeting rooms were spacious and the hotel staff kept refreshments aplenty. Breakfast and lunch each day in the restaurant was an unexpected gourmet treat - much more elegant than normally required for informal meals. The restaurant had a spectacular view of Puget Sound and when the sky was clear, the Olympic Mountains. The view was easily seen from any seating area. The bar area also had a menu but I didn't eat there - but the bar was large with a cozy decor. The concierge was friendly and helpful. One night she made a reservation for me at Cutter's Restaurant, making sure the restaurant would provide me complimentary transportation for my return to the hotel. At the restaurant, I was given an appetizer, courtesy of the concierge. Also, I needed a 4:15am town car pick up for the airport my last day and the concierge booked me with a company, saving me $15 off the most affordable transportation I found on my own on the internet. My only disappointment was the business center - very small and a $6 fee for use. Most hotels now offer this as a complimentary service. Maybe the Seattle Hilton will change this soon.

Not sure why people complain about check-in not being ground level as there are many examples of international hotels with a similar configuration. IMO, not something to really gripe about. I actually welcome it as it means the floors start at a higher level thus further removing you from street noise. Upon walking to the ground floor entrance, the bellman was extremely pleasant and asked if it was my first time. While waiting for the elevator, he carefully explained the hotel amenities and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I was a little early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. I left my bags with the concierge and went looking for lunch. Upon returning, my room was ready and was given a room on the 25th floor. I noticed they called this floor the HH floor. The room itself was a decent size. The furniture is newish and there is a flat screen tv, although I consider this \"de rigeur\" for the HIlton chain. I did think the comforter was a little on the thin side, but did the job. There is an in-room safe and an electric thermostat. Some of the hangers looked a little derelict but did the job. The washroom sink is separated from the toilet and bath. Both areas are quite small. One thing I did note is that the shower had excellent water pressure. As a HH Gold, I was allowed access to the 28th floor executive lounge and received a coupon for a free buffet breakfast on the top floor restaurant. There were some passes to places such as Gold's gym but I can't remember the other ones. The lounge had h'ors d'oeurves from 5-7 pm. I walked in and noted there was a single hot steamer (didn't look inside) with a decent selection of veggies. I think there was an alcohol selection. Didn't stay as I had other dinner plans. Next morning, went to the top floor restaurant for breakfast. The buffet was not the most plentiful I've seen but decently stocked. There were the standard bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast, pastries, fruit, etc. A feature I like about all Hiltons is that you can ask for made-to-order eggs as part of the buffet. I ordered an omelette and what came back was a HUGE omelette that was very good. I've had omelettes in plenty of hotels before and can vouch that this thing was big. Check-out was smooth. The whole time during my stay, there were reminders that \"I would be getting a survey and if I couldn't rate the hotel a 10, they encouraged me to call someone about it\". Considering the Hilton is NOT a 5 star hotel (I think 4 star), it met expectations. The staff certainly did try and tried hard. I would stay here again, provided the price is right. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (but TripAdvisor won't allow that) because the HVAC was a little loud and the smallish bathroom size.

The furniture in our room was in pristine condition and the widescreen LG tv's are great. The beds and bedding are also top notch. The one complaint I would have about the room would be that the bathroom area is on the small side. It is definately a one person sized area. You have to take turns getting ready. Also something that might be and issue for light sleepers who plan on sleeping in is that the hotel walls are on the thin side. Sound travels here. We woke early on both mornings to go out and could hear housekeeping knocking on doors loud and clear. I thought they were knocking on the door of the room next to ours but when I peeked out they were at least 5 doors down. We were given access to the concierge lounge on the 28th floor. It is a converted guest room and as such is not particularly spacious. The gentleman up there serving drinks is great for any kind of questions you may have about where to dine, what to see, etc. He recommended a fantastic restaurant to us and made us reservations as well. I can honestly say it was one of my top five dining experiences ever. I did not dine in the hotel restaurant or use the fitness room so I have no comment on those areas. There is a lobby bar which is fairly spacious but I never saw more than 5 guests in there at once. Not a super busy place. One final comment I would like to throw in about this hotel is that the staff we came across were all pleasant. I find this to be one of the things I judge an experience by the most. Its kind of like going to a restaurant and having wonderful food and horrid service. The food could be the best ever and you probably wouldn't go back because the service sucked.

The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere. The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key.

I was given some coupons to the bad breakfast buffet, but apparently everyone in the hotel had the same vouchers because the tiny room was packed and there were not enough tables. The decor in the rooms are very outdated. The bed was comfortable, but the shower and all other furnishings were not good. It was just a depressing room all around. It is in a good location. Hilton should just close it down and re-make the whole place, it could be a lot better. It is NOT worth the price they charge.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cBelow average\u201d", "Author": "martinsa", "ReviewID": "UR4967908", "Content": "Facilities are in need of an overhaul and feel very dated.

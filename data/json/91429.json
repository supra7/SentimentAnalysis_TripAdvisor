You know, the average businessperson or traveler who just wants to stay a night or two--or more--in a nice, comfortable, clean place with a friendly, helpful staff at an affordable price. (Mind you, the rates go up during the Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend, but they do all over the rmetro area, so...). There are restaurants around--a Cracker Barrel, McDonalds, and more. Nothing fancy, but easy to get to.

I didn't make reservations. When I got to the hotel, the front desk clerk (Joanie) who later became my saving grace - was checking in a family. She made eye contact with me and stated she'd be with me asap. We chatted a little while she was checking me in. She said that she lived close by and could help if I landed the job. I didn't think much of it, but when I came back in the next night - she asked how my interview went. Very thoughtful. I checked out the next morning and a couple of days later, I received a phone call that I had been hired. I called the hotel and made a reservation, so I could look at apartments. The young man who answered the phone stated that Joanie wasn't it, but he would help me. So he gave me a list of aparment complexes close by. When I checked in the following week, Joanie was again behind the front desk; greeted me with a huge smile and called me by name. The next day, she gave me a list of Indianapolis' do's and don'ts. I know I made the right decision in moving to Indianapolis. If everyone is a friendly as the staff at the Jameson Inn, I won't have any problem fitting in and making new friends. The rooms were great too! Spacious and clean. Robin in housekeeping attending to my every need. The breakfast was free and had wonderful waffles and biscuits and gravy. The hotel pool was sparking and relaxing of a long day of interviewing and apartment hunting. When family and friends come to visit - they will definitely stay here. Too bad they're not nationwide.

A friend had suggested this hotel for me to stay at. Thinking of all the surrounding hotels I had gone to in the past for races and things, lets just say my expectations were not high. But little to my surprise the value was more than worth the price. Once I came in it was a little early and the nice, clean boy behind the counter was very kind and greeted me with a \"Hello.\" walking in the the door. As I was checking in, I told him that I was looking for close by apartments, because I was moving back home. He was able to get me a whole list of NICE close apartments and check me in, WHILE naming off the hotels info. It was very kind of him to do. Once I got to the room it was in good condition. Clean. Comfy bed. (needed a nicer TV though ;) Went out for a swim, while setting up appointments with local apartments. And I got a VERY nice apartment from the first page of listings.

There were also stains on the carpets. Very disappointing, But I went back to the desk, and the clerk was very friendly and apologetic and gave us a different room. This room was better, but still had one sheet that was stained looking and a towel that was dirty looking. The clerk gave me more towels that seemed better.

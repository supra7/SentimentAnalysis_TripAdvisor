And honestly, I don't know that it was worth the trouble. I made reservations using my groupon discount that I got. When we arrived at the hotel at 6:00 pm, we had to wait over 45 minutes in the check-in line. As I stood there with my husband and three and five-year-old, the lobby was overrun with people standing and sitting everywhere as well. The longer I stood there it came to my attention that everyone else was waiting for a room. Some had been waiting for hours. It seems that Allerton could not handle the groupon deals well. Despite it being almost 7 o'clock, they still had no clean rooms available. There was no offer to discount our room, refund our room, give us a complimentary breakfast, and they couldn't help pay with parking because it is a separate business that runs the parking garage. We ended up having to wait until 8:00 pm until our room was available. The elevators did not work well. We had to push the button to call the elevator five times before one finally came. The light kept going off for elevator call. The room was small and the beds were short (not sure how they were two queen beds. My husband, at 5'7\", had his feet hanging over the end). The next morning at check-out, we had a 45 minute wait for our car to be brought to us from the valet. Despite the cost of the room (which I believe should have been comped because of our ridiculous wait), we paid $50 for parking + $18 for other fees (taxes?), I felt totally ripped off for the money I paid. I will definitely NOT be recommending this hotel to anyone. They made no effort to compensate us for our inconvenience. I have stayed in Chicago over 15 times, and this was by FAR the worst experience I had ever had. I would definitely recommend Avenue, St. James, Hotel Allegro, W, or Conrad over this place any day! The staff acted with courteous detachment and seemed to make little effort to make us happy. Oh, we did get a voucher for two glasses of wine. However, I don't drink, and I had two small children with me. Not really worth it at all. Avoid! Particularly if using with a groupon or living social discount.

Located at its mid-point is the Allerton, surely one of the best bargains on this pricey thoroughfare. The Allerton's neighboring hotels include the more luxurious and expensive Peninsula, the Affina, the Park Hyatt, and the Omni. I got a great deal here on Hotwire. As an older property, rooms tend to be on the small side. Mine was furnished with a queen-sized bed (a king would never have fit), a minimalist thin table/desk pushed against a heating unit under a window (but compensated for with an excellent ergonomic swivel chair), a small closet of little use because the floor-mounted safe took up most of its space, and a bathroom with a full window view and a commodious marble tiled walk-in shower with a rainshower head and an abundance of hot water. Towels, etc. were plentiful and of good quality. There was a small shelf above the sink and toilet which is probably adequate for a male guest, but a female guest might have trouble finding enough room on it to accommodate all her toiletries and what-not. The room was supplied with four GLASS glasses (how I hate plastic cups wrapped in plastic -- something one finds all too often even in \"better\" hotels) which were replaced daily. There was a wall-mounted flatscreen TV which you could really only watch from bed owing to its stationary positioning. The bed was very comfortable, the white linens sparkling. There were an abundance of electrical outlets in the room, but many of them already in use and the free ones inconveniently placed for my Bi-Pap breathing machine. So, I sacrificed the use of a bedside lamp to plug it in. The bedside table was miniscule - so small, in fact, that the alarm clock was on the table/desk on the opposite wall. But the view? WOW! I had two full windows in this corner room and another full window in the bathroom. From my 12th floor aerie, two of them looked north down Michigan Ave. overlooking the historic Water Tower and on to Lake Michigan and the Oak Street Beach. With the exception of the occasional fire engine or police siren, the room was amazingly and peacefully quiet. There's shopping galore (even if only gazing in windows) nearby. There's a Brooks Brothers on the ground level of the hotel, a multi-storey indoor mall across the street anchored by a Saks Fifth Ave, a Neiman-Marcus on the next block and a Bloomingdale's further down the street. There's also a Polo Ralph Lauren store and Tiffany's is right there too! For regular, last-minute needs, there's a Walgreen's just steps away. The neighborhood has an array of very easy-on-the-pocketbook eateries. M Burger (think In-and-Out or Five Guys) has only 7 stools, so plan on carry-out. It's across the street from the hotel. On the same block, head east to Elephant and Castle. Gino's East (originators of classic deep-dish pizza) has an outpost just a few blocks away. Even Walgreen's has a huge selection of good food items - sushi, even! I got a veggie tray, a fruit cup, pita chips and hummus, and a yogurt parfait there along with soft drinks. Given the area's eating options, the Allerton's restaurant is serviceable but uneven and expensive with sporadic hours at dinner. I got an excellent reuben sandwich and lobster bisque from room service one night. However, the yolks on the eggs benedict one morning in the restaurant were hard-boiled, not runny. Another day at lunch downstairs, I repeated the reuben sandwich (go with a winner) with their excellent shoestring potatoes and a top-notch generous bowl of cream of mushroom soup. The $9 apple tart for dessert (which had been obviously nuked) did not come with the advertised ice cream but only a sliced, fanned-out strawberry. The menu featured \"a trio of gelato's (sic) and sorbetto's (sic).\" So much for proof-reading and basic grammatical knowledge, a sad sign of the times, alas. My 12th floor hallway would have benefitted from a thorough vaccuuming, but overall the physical appearance of the Allerton is very good from its motor entrance to the lobby, restaurant, and other public areas including my room.

The address is Michigan Ave., but the hotel entrance is on the side street, not on Michigan. From Michigan, you only see the Brooks Brothers store that occupies the bottom floor of the building. We had our GPS guiding us, but missed the hotel and had to loop back around to get to the hotel entrance. We dropped off our car at the valet garage next door ($48 for the night) and were able to check in quickly. We were given the choice of a standard room overlooking Mich. Ave. or a queen room with no view. We chose the queen room in hopes of a bigger bed, but I swear the bed in there was only a full. We knew going in that the rooms would be tiny, and they certainly lived up to that expectation. We had enough room to move around, but just barely. When we checked in, I thought the clerk had said there was complimentary Wifi, but when I tried to log on, there was a charge. When I called the front desk to clarify, I was immediately put on hold. After over 5 minutes on hold, I got tired of waiting and hung up. The hotel fulfilled the purpose of having a place to stay downtown on New Year's Eve, but the atmosphere of the hotel itself didn't offer much. Once you find it, the location is great.

This time it was the Allerton Hotel and we were very excited about the chance to stay on the Magnificent Mile near Water Tower Place. The view alone should have been remarkable given the hotel's location. Too bad that wasn't the case. Foremost, entry to the hotel is at the ground level to a drab and unwelcoming baggage claim area. You are instructed to take the elevator to the 2nd floor lobby. These items alone should be immediate warnings that you are about to be disappointed - as you will be. The elevators that you will get on are capable of holding five or maybe six people at maximum - there are closets in Brooklyn that are larger. To add to it, the number of elevators is quite small. 3 total service the 20+ floors of guests. 1 elevator (of same size) services just the first three floors. Oh, and they crawl like snails. You will have to wait overly long for one, and I hope you're not closterphobic as you will be on it for a while. Encountering the lobby is like visiting a cave. It is dark - black desk, black walls, not well lit, and has the feel of a Bosnian regional airport terminal check-in. You're hoping that you can catch the next flight and leave quickly. Here the staff were courtious and friendly - this was one positive I saw throughout the hotel (including bag handlers, maids, and maintenance personnel). A bar / lounge is positioned next to the conceriege. It too was black and drab and never had anyone in it in the times we were there. On to the rooms. Once we were finally delivered to our floor (with those elevators it took quite some time), we opened the door to our assigned room. Let me be perfectly blunt - I was appauled. While it was clean, those closets in Brooklyn were still chuckling and I think walk-in closets in Cleveland were snickering. Two double beds along with a desk and chair had been stuffed into a long and narrow room. The decor was okay, but little else was. There was literally 10 inches of space between the desk and wall in which to squeeze by to enter the space. Luggage had to be picked up and carried over top the desk as there was absolutely no way it would clear the narrow confines otherwise. The curtains were open to the view that would be ours for our three night stay. There was no sunlight but instead a complete and total view of the side of a brick building some 10 feet away. Literally no sunlight in, and no view out - just bricks and mortar to add to drab and dreary. A Bosnia airport terminal would have have more of a view. The bathroom was ample with large sink and a single shower stall with clear glass sliding doors. If you'd rather not be seen in your birthday suit during a shower, don't plan to allow the spouse in the bathroom to simultaniously work at the sink. Oh, and the flush handle of the toilet sticks right out in the walkway - you're sure to flush it on the way to the shower if you're not careful. The only redeeming qualities of the bathroom were a great shower head and water pressure that gave a wonderful shower and the conditioner that the Allerton offered. Ready to go to sleep? I hope not. While the beds look nice, they really aren't beds, but rather trampolines. Seriously, the bounce on these things was incredible. I'm surprised they didn't just bounce themselves out into the trash bin. They made for the worst sleep ever. The beds were tremendously uncomfortable. It's especially obvious how bad they are when my children (both under 10) complain that their backs hurt after a night on the bed. I'd have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor. The only positive was that the sheets and pillows were of good quality - not premium, but acceptable. There is one last dig I have to make on the Allerton and it concerns WiFi. Most downtown Chicago hotels understand that WiFi is important to their guests and willinging provide it freely. It is afterall terribly inexpensive to operate and maintain. However, the Allerton would rather charge you for use to the tune of $10 per day. Talk about nickel and diming to death! The one fortune we found was that a couple of the stores on Michigan Avenue in the near vacinity of the Allerton did freely offer WiFi to their clients and the WiFi signal was strong enough to be used from the room. We had full internet capability through their signal without having to dip into our pockets to laiden the Allerton with more profits. Their stealing a good night's rest from us on the attrocious beds was punishment enough. If you are looking to stay in downtown Chicago and want to be in the area of the Allerton let me strongly suggest the Affinia Hotel instead - one block over. Our experience at that hotel was rather positive. The Allerton was horrid and we shall not return.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rock Falls IL", "Title": "\u201cA Good Choice\u201d", "Author": "carol v", "ReviewID": "UR122350876", "Content": "We have nevered stay at the Allerton before, but decided to take a chance on a Michigan Ave. Hotel, Since this was the second weekend in Dec. thought the price would be over the top, but it was not.

My wife and I make Chicago our regular \"easy vacation\" spot since we live in Michigan; we've stayed in various hotels in or around downtown, etc. The hotel interior itself was very nice. It was clean with old-style character. Strange to not have a coffee maker in each room, but not that big of a deal to go down and get some cups in the lobby. We bought the suite groupon and were impressed with the view and the room...when we finally made it there... Upon making the reservation I was told by staff to \"call whenever you arrive and see if the room is available.\" We did this as we were heading to the hotel and were told that the room would be available \"later in the day.\" We had our car valet parked at the hotel and had our bags stored until check-in. At this point we were again told by the valet that the rooms \"often are ready before 3pm so go on upstairs and see if it is ready now.\" Again we were told \"later in the day.\" So we happily walked around Chicago for a while and came back around 2:30pm. The staff said \"the room will be ready soon, it is almost done being cleaned.\" Fine, because room check-in WAS at 3 pm and we were early. So we said we'd wait in the lobby. As another reviewer stated, there were many families waiting to check-in. At about 3:15, I checked again and was told \"the rooms aren't ready yet. They are nearly oversold and not cleaned.\" This time I directly asked when they would be ready and if we could have our bags brought up to the lobby. The bags needed to be taken to the room, she said, and the room would be ready soon...they would come get us in the lobby... We sat down. At about 3:45 my wife asked the front desk for some kind of estimate...the front desk said they would try to call the cleaning staff. My wife stood near the desk waiting for 10 minutes with no call from cleaning, no apology or anything from the front desk. At this point an irate middle-aged woman who arrived about 20 minutes after us and was waiting in the lobby like us came up to the desk demanding her suite be ready and asked for a late check-out and amazingly the room was ready and the front desk granted her a 2 pm checkout. My wife and I [we are in our 20s] inquired why her suite suddenly was available and miraculously our room was suddenly available, too. My wife said \"we would like a late check-out as well and the front desk woman said \"I can do one o'clock.\" No, that lady in front of us just was given 2 pm check-out. So we had our keys and up to the room. The end, right? No... We waited for our bags for about 25 minutes and then I called to ask and was told \"I'll call the valet, sorry.\" 35 minutes in, we get a knock with a valet worker with someone else's bags \"are these your bags?\" 45 minutes I call again. \"Valet should bring your bags up shortly.\" Our bags were over an hour late to our room when the front desk said they would be up in \"about 15 minutes.\" The thing is, if they would've said \"we're totally swamped because of the groupon\" or \"we've been granting late check-outs for days because of poor service\" and then told us directly that we wouldn't be able to check in until four or even later, my wife and I would not have cared. We were in Chicago. There are places to go. It's just the \"be ready soon\" \"not sure, I'll call the cleaning person\" nonsense that pushes your buttons.

The bed was very comfortable and we had two tvs and a couch in our room as well (however, our friends did not get the same couch and 2nd tv even though they also bought the groupon). The location was perfect for sight seeing and our room even had a partial view of Michigan Avenue.

There are a number of mixed reviews on this hotel and I can understand why. First: note this is a NOT a hotel for a family visit, unless your family is European or is quite adventuresome and doesn't mind smallish rooms and looking elsewhere for breakfast. A number of other reviews provide details on the location, etc. so let's move on. This is a very nice, contemporary european hotel, with ecclectic color palettes, textures and styles - but it works. The hallways have nice character with some rooms down short hallways and not directly off the main hallway. The lighting in the rooms and hallways is subdued - again, very European. The rooms themselves are decidedly small. Request an upgrade to a King room if you need a lot of space or are planning to stay more than one night (or want a tub). The marbled bathroom (floor included) is a nice touch - quite classy, but again, doesn't provide any \"counter top\" space (pedestal sink). The beds looked flat & lumpy, but were adequate and slept okay. The breakfast \"buffet\" is random - it's only a buffet depending on the level of occupancy in the hotel. I'd skip it and try West Egg Cafe or Panera Bread, both only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Also, the $25 cleaning fee for even using the refrigerator is an unnecessary inconvenience - we walked to our car to store leftover foods from great Chicago restaurantes. (Good thing it was December!) The service was generally friendly and competent. We had problems with a very noisy neighbor one night and the hotel staff handled the situation with authority giving confidence that they want to maintain a high-quality establishment. This leads to the awkward spot comment. This hotel seems to do a lot of business with discount travel sites, which with its exorbitent breakfast, refrigerator fees & parking ($48/night) - I can understand why. However, this seems to breed the type of clientele that make the hotel less desirable. I would recommend the hotel make a few changes: Improve mattress quality; change the mini-bar fee to be on par with the rest of the (American hotel) world; provide a buffet daily \"regardless of occupancy\" and include more variety in it; after all those changes are made, increase hotel prices by 20% and still work with discounters. You will provide more value at your rack rates and will maintain and perhaps improve your clientele staying via discounters.

I booked a deal off of RueLala for $129/night for a King room which included free wi-fi, 2 complementary drinks per night and \"continental breakfast for 2 (up to a $30 value)\" each day. The rate was a little higher than I had hoped for, but I figured since we were getting $30 worth of breakfast per day, I'd do it. Well, first of all- we only got 1 breakfast ticket (instead of 2). Then, when we go downstairs the waitress wasn't certain about the terms of the deal and had to go ask, which took 10+ minutes. Then we find out that this $30 worth of breakfast ($15 for each person), is only for the cold buffet. If we wanted to upgrade to the hot buffet we'd have to pay an extra $7-8 each. And this card wasn't good toward food on their actual menu. I was very hungry so I decided to just deal with the free breakfast. Lo and behold, this consisted of 3 cereal selections, lukewarm milk, sub-par croissants and muffins, picked-over fruit salad (only honeydew left) and apples, banana or oranges. It sucked. Biggest rip-off ever. Before I booked, I tried calling the reservations department to ask about the terms of this free breakfast and no one was able to answer my question. It's my own fault for booking, but had I know the breakfast was so crappy I wouldn't have booked. That would have worked to my advantage because the next week I saw a similar deal for the Allerton on Groupon without breakfast or drinks for $99. I sadly couldn't exchange. Oh well. The hotel itself was nice though. Beautiful room and bathroom, comfortable beds. The people that worked there were very nice, as well. We came to check in before 3, expecting to have to check our bags but they were able to give us a room immediately, which was great. Also, it's only a short walk to the Chicago Red subway stop. Very good location. The only other complaints I have are that the elevators are horrible. There were 5 available and were very small. We stayed on the 21st floor and every time we took the elevator it took a long time to get to us. It also felt like we stopped on every other floor to pick up people on the way down. It got to the point that there was no more room for people on the elevators below the 12th floor or so. So if you get a room that isn't on the top of the hotel you were sheet out of luck. The bathroom was beautiful, all marble- but it was constantly freezing in there- even if we left the door open. It was uncomfortable going barefoot in there. Also, we checked our bags on the ground floor the day we were supposed to check out, since our flight didn't leave until 7. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get our bags.

It took too long to get the bill for breakfast, even though it was a buffet. We ate breakfast all 3 days we were there. We were never given a bill at the table, though we waited with empty plates and coffee cups for 5 to 10 minutes each day. We had to go to the hostess station after breakfast and request our bill and wait another 5 minutes to get the bill from the server. 2.) Upon check out, the man helping me at the desk got as far as getting my name and room number, and then took a call that lasted at least 5 minutes. What was more frustrating that that was he could not do 2 things at once. The caller was asking general information but the desk clerk could not even pull my room info up while he was on the phone. In the meantime, a long line of people began forming behind me, waiting to check out. 3.) The Groupon included free internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however they charged me for it. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it at check out (due to the daggers coming from the people in the long line behind me) I had to call back to have it removed. 3.) The whole in-room refrigerator deal was a fiasco and total rip off. Apparently there was a 6x6 note on a fridge that was at knee level on the door stating there is a restocking fee, however we never read the sign because we assumed that it was a price list for the contents inside. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink anything, but we did put in our own water. Not until check out were we told that the refrigerator is weight sensitive AND that had we wanted to put our own water in the fridge, we could have called housekeeping to have one brought up to the room (did I mention the room was small? Where would they even put it?) They stated that even though we did not drink anything, there was a $25 restocking fee (everything was in its original place) and will not remove it from my bill. This is totally absurd and these are the types of things that need to be relayed to the guests upon check in and not on a small, knee level note on the fridge door. 4.)

We chose the Allerton because of a previous good experience. This time, very disappointing: Entrance is small but cozy. This is a classic older \"vintage\" hotel so there are some things that deserve grace. Here are specifics: Reception - good, attentive, quick Elevators: VERY inefficient, bring a book or a scarf to knit, you will need something to do as you wait. They are extremely small so if your group is larger than 5 or more than a carry-on luggage you will need two. Hallways: carpets need replacing - old, stained, dingy. Understand the vintage decor, but the carpeting still needs updating. Room: We were given the guest room of a suite. Way to small for our foursome. We shimmied our way around the luggage and packages all weekend. No closet, no coffee-maker, no iron or board - very annoying to be so cramped. Beds were comfortable, room temp good. The view of the alley was disappointing and the dumpster noice and talking in the alley all night long was terrible. The windows are so thing it seemed like they were open. The sirens from emergency vehicles drowned out the dumpter sounds. Bathroom: Amazing how a architect could accurately design the door to be about 1/16 of an inch from the basin countertop! I've never seen such precision! SMALL. An overweight person would have trouble getting in that bathroom - seriously. The shower was roomy, clean, immediate hot water, nice big shower head and good pressure. Towels were old/used. Restaurant: They only serve breakfast and lunch - plan ahead to make reservations somewhere else. Breakfast menu was good. We had the buffet - eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, variety of cereals, nice variety of fresh fruit medley, bananas, apples, oranges. JUice, coffee and feshly made toast included. Cost ~ $15. Servers were excellent - very attentive. Overall impression: a 2 out of a 1-5 scale with 5 being best. Some things a 1. I would stay somewhere else.

The two hotels we usually stay at in the city were fully booked and we were referred by a friend to stay at the Allerton Hotel. They spoke great things about their recent stay so we thought we would have nothing to worry about. They must have stayed when this hotel was having a good week. Check - in was a breeze and the easiest part of our stay here. The female at the desk was nice and accommodating considering the line of guests she was trying to get through. It then went downhill from here. We arrived in our room to unpack and get ready for the dinner reservations we had at a prime steakhouse that is almost next to impossible to get when we found that the shower was not functioning properly. A pipe above the shower head was spraying water all over the entire bathroom when we attempted to turn the shower on. We called maintenance and they arrived within 5 minutes, just like they quoted us. They were polite and apologetic and determined to fix the shower so that we could continue on with our evening. One hour later, shower still broken, the front desk called up and asked us if the issue had been resolved. My Husband explained what was going on and all the operator said was OK. She did not even mention the possibility of switching rooms. In the meantime I was able to go online to see if there were other rooms available and found that the Allerton was booked solid for the entire weekend. We remained patient in hopes that the shower would be fixed and we would still make it to dinner on time. Now yes, we could have just changed and gone to dinner without a shower but A.)Who is comfortable after 8 hours of travel? B.) How could that be done with 3 maintenance men coming and going in and out of your room? After two hours of this, one of the maintenance men asked if we would like to have our rooms switched. We did not think this was an option since the front desk never mentioned it and the hotel was booked. Of course we said yes, and the maintenance man went down to the desk to have our room switched. Take note - the best service came from the 3 men working on our shower, NOT from anyone else working in the hotel. If you are wondering if we made our dinner reservation I can tell you we did not. And we could not even get in the following evening either. This was a huge disappointment for my Husband who talks about this steakhouse like none other exist. Upon checking out the following day we voiced our concern to the front desk. The gentleman that checked us out was of no help whatsoever. He stared at my Husband like he had two heads and his solution was he would have one of the two managers call us when they came in at 8am. Eight more long hours of travel home and we never received a phone call. Once home, my Husband called the hotel back to speak to a manager. After nine minutes on hold (nine minutes is a long time) he was connected and then disconnected. After another follow up call he was then connected to the manager on duty. The manager expressed his apologies and offered to give us a credit, on the first night cost of the room. A credit? Yes, a credit that was not even half the cost of the first night stay. He also offered to \"put us up\" the next time we visited Chicago but never offered to take our information in order to follow through with this offer. In the end, my Husband and I will never stay with The Allerton Hotel again, which is a shame since it is centrally located on N Michigan Ave and a short walk to pretty much everywhere.

Lots of ambulances go by with sirens blasting. Also lots of horns honking given the traffic. Even on the 18th floor the room was noisy because of street noise. The room is very small. The bathroom is super small. The bathroom had a shower, toilet and sink, and not much more. If I had to guesstimate the size of the bathroom it would be 5 X 5. If you are sharing the washroom, no chance. I also found housekeeping to not be to detailed...some days no replacements of coffee cups, missed spots on vacuuming, etc. The room is modern and bright. Inviting and comfortable. I got charged for parking, but didn't even have a car. Got that taken off bill, but stuff like that shouldn't happen. Also we had comp wifi as part of our package, but we had to ask for this and not given details of how we would access. Front desk was inconsistent in terms of service.

I was there for an annual meeting of a nonprofit organization that I'm associated with. Last year I was here for the same meeting at the Allerton. I have to give the Allerton high marks for both stays. The room I stayed in this year was a king bed room and it was spacious with a good closet. The bath was compact, but with a very nice walk-in shower. The room was very clean and the bathroom was spotless. As someone in the hotel for meetings, I have to say the meeting rooms on the 23rd floor of the hotel are just amazing. The bright modern decor of these rooms in this lovely vintage building is great, but the views from the enormous windows easily surpass the decor. I don't know anything about booking space in a hotel for conference meetings, but for the conference planners out there, I have to say these are the nicest meeting rooms I've ever seen. Even in a lot of high-end hotels where I've attended meetings, the meeting rooms are usually windowless and sometimes in the basement. It was wonderful to spend two and a half days in meetings here enjoying the stunning views. Actually, my favorite hotel in Chicago is the Sofitel Water Tower, but I've really enjoyed my stays at the Allerton. I think the staff is one of the Allerton's great assets. The staff at the front desk, in the restaurant, and in the lounge were all very friendly and welcoming. One night during my stay I had dinner in the lounge. Mark, the barman and server, was very professional and gracious. During check-in and check-out the staff at the desk were very nice and helpful. The staff at the Allerton really seem to get the customer service thing. My one negative comment is about the wireless internet service in the rooms. Downloads were very slow at times and there were constant breaks in the connection. Like far too many hotels, the Allerton is charging premium prices for daily internet service and it's not nearly good enough service to justify the charges. The $!4.95 per day charge is the equivalent of almost $5,500 annually. For a hell of a lot less than that I have much better, much faster wireless internet service in my home. The Allerton, like a lot's of other hotels, need to do much better on this issue.

Downsides: *You must pay for wifi $10 in room (free wifi on their lobby floor tho). * Parking fee is ridiculous (but I didn't drive, so no matter). * You must upgrade and increase your avg expected cost if you want a nicer room * TV too small - and far away from bed. If you plan on staying in and channel surfing, in the King room it's so far away and small from the bed that you won't see anything. * Your experience may vary greatly depending on your room (that's just my guess). * No rooftop bar or pool that other hotels might have. Upsides: * Prime location to magnificent mile * Excellent service. Even when their room service was closed late, they had a partner pizza place that delivered late late. * Nice modern rooms.

I remember the reservation person was extremely helpful. We used our AAA discount and got what we felt was a good rate. I read some on line reviews about the rooms/bathrooms being very small but because we were sharing a room and got 2 double beds we found the room more than adequate for our needs- Yes, they are on the small side- like in europe- but since we hardly spent any time in the room it was not a problem. More importantly, the rooms seemed to be newly renovated - spotless- with very comfortable beds- Our bathroom had a large shower and a shelf above the sink which was fine for handling a few items- toothbrushes, etc.- Being women we needed some extra space for our sundries- so we put those items on the desk- located right outside the bathroom- so it was not a hassle- We weren't using the desk so it served a good purpose. We did feel it would have been better if we had some drawers to put our clothes away but we kept our suticases (small) on top of the 2 radiators in the room and made due- Our other clothes went into the closet- We requested a guiet room and got one- We didn't care about the view- more important for us not to be woken up by street noise since the hotel is in a great location next to Michigan Avenue- The main street- The one thing we did notice was that it seems the carpet in the hallways needs some TLC but that might be the next project on the list- We liked that the Allerton was not a big overwhelming hotel- as I said- it had more of a european flavor- so we enjoyed that- The Lobby where you register is near the dining room the decor was modern but somehow also has an \"old world feel\"- The staff was terrific- Very helpful- We ate breakfast out every day but our last day we had a wonderful full buffet breakfast for about $14 each at the hotel- That also included unlimited juice, coffee,tea -which made it quite a deal- We also want to note that the concierge who helped us that week- Mr. Bouchaib Oumelaz was terrific- Very knowledgeable and extremely patient- He even made sure to get us our boarding passes for SW airlines while we were out for the day- He really helped make our visit to Chicago a success!!!!!!

I tend to only write reviews if somewhere I've stayed or eaten is particularly good, as I feel that people usually don't get around to commending good service, & only comment when there's something to moan about. I've therefore held off this review for several months, assuming that I'd end up being able to write the positive review I'd expected to be submitting. My experience with the Allerton is a real curate's egg, & I hope that my writing about the good and bad may help future guests to get the good but avoid the bad. The good bits first... The hotel is beautifully designed, in an unbeatable location, & all the staff whom I encountered during my stay were absolutely fantastic. Yes, the room was smaller than many I've stayed in on trips to America, but there was more than enough space (who really *needs* acres of space in a hotel room?!). Moreover, it was beautifully designed - stylish and extremely comfortable. It's true - as other reviewers have noted - that there are high charges for in-room wifi & items from the mini-bar, but to be honest, that's clearly flagged up, so I really don't think that it's a problem. The hotel bar is nicely cosy, & beautifully in keeping with the hotel's fabulous overall design aesthetic, & has a great cocktail list & excellent mixologists. My colleague & I were en route to an annual conference in Michigan - we like to have a one-night stopover in Chicago as a mini-holiday, to recover from the transatlantic flight & to catch up over cocktails & dinner as a treat before the imminent hard work & long days at the conference. We were both delighted with our experience at the Allerton & had determined to make this our regular pre-conference hotel, and strongly recommended it to other friends & colleagues at the conference. But now to the less good bit... when I got back to the UK, I noticed that I'd been charged for a breakfast which I'd not had (we'd gone instead to an excellent nearby diner recommended by the concierge). True, I should have spotted this on the bill at check-out, but I'd asked for a new bill as I'd had a bottle of water from the mini-bar, & as there were also cocktails from the bar on the bill & the taxi was waiting, I didn't register the discrepancy. An easy mistake to make both on my part & the hotel's, & one which I didn't think would be difficult to rectify. Unfortunately, however, I've still not received a reply to my three emails. I'm more than aware that it's not a huge amount of money, but am surprised - given the extremely high quality of customer service during our stay - that nobody's bothered to reply. Even a 'tough, you should have noticed at the time' would have been better than nothing! This chimes with our experience before we arrived - we both booked via booking agencies, & my colleague emailed the hotel to check that all was in order with her booking, rather than risking turning up post-flight with nowhere to stay, but received no reply. Concerned, I also mailed a couple of times, but got no reply. My colleague eventually rang & all was well. We'd have thought no more of it - it's possible, & understandable, that hotels aren't keen to offer the same customer service to guests who haven't booked directly - but the lack of response to my post-stay mails suggests that this may be a more general issue. As it's a silly amount of money, I'm not going to bother making a transatlantic phone-call on my home phone-bill, but as this suggests shoddier customer service than I'd expect from any hotel (let alone one in America), I'm also not going to bother booking here again. I know that I'm kind of cutting off my nose to spite my face - on the evidence of my actual stay at the hotel, I'd rate it 5* on all counts, & would wholeheartedly recommend The Allerton to anyone, & urge them to ignore the negative reviews about room-size & queues for the lift (yes, you may have to wait, but you get to chat to lovely people while doing so!). But as there are so many excellent hotels in Chicago who don't ignore their guests before and after their stay, I'll - reluctantly - be going elsewhere from now on. I really hate writing negative reviews (especially over so small an amount of money), but hopefully this may allow people to avoid a similar error, which could well be for a less trifling amount.

Valet and self park next door is $48/24hours! we parked several blocks away at LSD for $31/nite. Location right on the corner of MIchigan ave with and Apple store on the corner--great for shopping, bad for traffic. We had a view of the old Water tower from 1612, but also the fire escapes. We didn't use the in house restaurant or gym. There's free coffee in the am and lemonade in the afternoon. The bed is comfy. Walls are a little thin, although our room was a lockoff--don't know if that makes a difference since there was someone next door.

For Priceline \"Name your price\" bidders, the hotel offers rooms with only one double bed. I called Priceline and told them that this was unacceptable because the \"name your price\" bid was for a room that accommodates two adults, and the hotel's website states that the room with one double bed, \"the petite classic\", is perfect for the single traveler. Priceline argued and argued with me and told me that basically I was stuck. I called the hotel and explained my dilema, and also explained that I am pregnant, so if they give us a room with a double bed, one of us will have to sleep on the floor. The hotel ensured that we would have appropriate accommodations. When we checked in, I found out that the room that was reserved for us was in a location that was usually reserved for airline employees, so it was at the end of the hall, shared almost no walls with other rooms, and was far away from the ice machine and elevator.

The room was in the shape of a \"U\", so that the desk and sitting area was almost completely seperate from the bed/bath area. The room had a queen bed with enough room for my husband, me, and my baby belly. Our room had an awesome view, almost 180 degrees, with views of the Magnificent Mile, and two views of Lake Michigan. The room was exceptionally clean and we had very good control over the temperature in the room. There were two plush white robes in the closet, furnished by the hotel.

It definitely has a historic hotel feel with modern updates. We booked through Hotwire, and I would recommend this. If you do enough Google searching you can pretty much know exactly what hotel you are booking before you book it. The location itself is a good enough reason to stay here. Literally a block or so from water tower place and right on Michigan Ave. Our room looked straight down onto the Apple Store. Also, the overall view from our room was great! The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. We like to venture around the hotels we stay in so we took a trip up in the elevator to the Tip, Top, Tap Ballroom. We ran into a staff member who knew exactly what we were doing so he unlocked the ballroom for us and let us explore by ourselves! The view was incredible and we were able to take some great pictures! We were also very surprised to find out that a friend of ours called the hotel and had a bottle of Champagne and two glasses sent to our room to celebrate our engagement! I also ordered breakfast in bed for us on our first morning. The food was great and the service was punctual. Room size: I was pretty concerned after reading some reviews about the room sizes. Yes, they are small, but this didn't detract from our stay one bit! Especially since we were only staying two nights. This is the absolute PERFECT hotel for a getaway trip to Chicago!

My stay was short, only two nights, but the experience was positive. My first impressions, however, were not so positive as registration is on the second floor and I found very limited signage where I entered on the first floor to direct me up to the second. Also, the first floor lobby is quite small, one small room and a narrow hallway for the elevators (I later noticed that this lobby got quite crowded if a few groups of people entered at the same time). Once I got to the second floor, things got better (though the second floor lobby was also small). Check-in was quick and staff were friendly and polite. My corner room was small, about 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by 13\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with nice, up-to-date furnishings in good condition. I would have preferred a firmer mattress on my full-sized bed, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. The desk was narrow (some of us still use paper and like to spread our papers out!), and the chair not so comfortable. There was a flat-screen TV. Wi-fi worked well though it was slow (512K). The closet was tiny. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturbed by noise from the hallway or the street. The bathroom had a shower only. Water pressure in the shower was acceptable and there was plenty of hot water. Toiletries were very nice. There was a pedestal sink with just a small shelf nearby so not the best set-up for early morning grooming. The bathroom was very clean as was the room. The meeting rooms were fine and had working wi-fi. The chairs, however, were very uncomfortable especially for all day meetings! I had lunch in the hotel restaurant one day and thought it was fine. The hotel is located in a nice area with many restaurants nearby. It is also five (short) blocks from the CTA, which made travel between O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare and the hotel easy and inexpensive.

When we first arrived, our room was so small we literally could not get our suitcases in past the doorway. The bathroom was also very small. My shoulders actually brushed each wall as I walked in, it was so narrow. We explained to the concierge that our room was far too small for our needs and they put us a suite which had more space. The room decor in both rooms and the hotel was nice but run down. The wall paper was peeling off, the bathrooms needed some refurbishment, the carpet in our room had burn holes in it, paint was chipping off and the beds were very poor quality. Additionally some of the public areas needs to be cleaned up. The hotel offers nothing in the way of amenities. They only provide soap and shampoo, no lotion, no toothpaste or other things you might need but forgot to bring. There are also no vending machines and no gift shop. The bar and restaurant are only open limited hours (soft drinks and water are $4 in both the hotel and the bar). There are places nearby that you can go to for necessities but be aware that they are not available in the hotel. The Allerton, while it did not meet our expectations comfort-wise, is staffed by people ready and willing to do whatever they can to make your visit a good one. The location is prime, it is right in the middle of the magnificent mile and only blocks to some of the most famous Chicago attractions. The only thing we could not overlook were the beds. They were miserable. They were old, hard, and the mattresses were in disrepair. The springs had worn through most of the inner lining and they can be felt when you lay down. If the beds had been more comfortable, the other things probably wouldn't have mattered so much. Overall, this is a decent historic hotel in a very good location.

What I'd add to that is how much all of these positives really stood out to me, in just one night at the place. The classy doorman who went above and beyond what's called for to earn a tip; the front desk staff that allowed us an extremely early check-in; a top-of-the-line fitness center; and how truly cool the interior redesign made the hotel seem, compared to other chain hotels we've stayed at. Sure, their lowest-priced single bed room is a bit smaller than you may be used to (a common complaint), but I think that's overblown. It's only an issue if you spend your whole day in the room, if you're extremely LARGE people or if you are nitpicky (in my opinion). We got the room for around $70 total on a priceline blind bid (3 star level, I believe), and think that the most I'd pay here is $75. Maybe I'm spoiled by priceline's \"name your own price\" feature, but this seems like the fair price for a room at the Allerton, compared to the $100-plus advertised on the property's web site.

The rooms are small (some smaller than others, even in the same category). The decor is basic, but nice. Although we did not spend any time in the lobby, it looked interesting. My brother arrived by car and parking was incredibly expensive (around $40-something per day).

The bathroom was also small, with only a pedastal sink, so there was nowhere to set toiletries. For two women, this was a problem. The beds, although comfy, were really short, so tall people beware. Thankfully, we were only staying for one night, as any more time would have been difficult. The room was clean but there were a few things we noticed. The lampshade was cracked and torn, and there was some gouges in the walls...in my mind this is not acceptable for a hotel of this price. The elevators were also tiny, and slow, so we often had to wait if there were people in them. Overall the hotel was nice, just be prepared for the tiny accommodations. If you're only in town for a night or two and won't be spending time in your room, then I would recommend it, but definitely no more than 2 people per room.

After reading the reviews here, i was a little bit hessitant to stay there, and since i work in the hotel business managing the Front office area, i know what to expect about costumer service, and at this point; i didn't know what to expect after having terrible experiences at the other two hotels. After i checked out of the hilton i called and asked if the room was ready to check in and they said it was (being 10am) Walking in to the hotel was a bit tricky since the loby is on the 2nd floor and you have to take an elevator. Once at the lobby, Lindsey checked us in. Very professional. I had call prefiously to let them know that i wanted to upgrade my room to a larger room with a king size bed at the checked in even if i had to pay for it; so they did upgrade the room to 1219. Big room. The hotel is very nice and ellegant with an excellent location. Is right on the middle of the magnificent mile, bus stop right on the corner and the red line train station is 4 little blocks away so deff i think i made a great choice at staying there. Tthe staff is very professional, Lindsey and Alicia at the front desk, Mrs. Guadalupe the maid, The guy from the minibar department i cant remember his name but he speaks spanish. And 3 of the doormans. To all of them Thank you very much and Thanks to to the management for having such a great staff with you. The only problem i would have to complain, would be the bell man service (not all of the people by the way). There was an afroamerican guy who couldn't understand what we were saying. They kept our bags for a while since we were not going to be in the room and they don't have a key to access so when we came back from dinner and shopping, we explained that to him and he would say different things. Finally we told him that we were back and that our suitcases could be delivered to the room and he just brought the suitcases and handed it to us so we took it. I tought it was funny so i didn't say anything. I should be moving to chicago for school next year, and ill make a couple trips before that so i would deff stay there again.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It may be the best hotel deal in downtown Chicago. Nearby Omni and Peninsular Hotels are considerably more expensive.

Nevertheless, the room was very attractive (see photos) and clean, bed was extremely comfortable (i.e. very firm), temperature was easily controlled, which includes being able to keep the fan on low (to prevent fan turning on and off during night, which often keeps me awake at other hotels). Room was also quiet, despite being directly across from elevators. And you cannot beat the convenience if you want to be in the Miracle Mile area north of downtown. Maid service was also good and unobtrusive. Hotel drawbacks include tiny and slow elevators; and lobby on second floor that can only be reached by elevator. It would be nice to have a stairway to/from ground level exit. Rooms were small, but that's what you would expect from a hotel of that age. They have made the most of the space they have.

You have to take elevator to 24th floor, and then walk upstairs to next floor, which was very warm....but thankfully, the fitness center itself is kept nice and cool.

On the plus side, the Allerton is located in a central and convenient part of Chicago and has a modern feel. I found the room to be OK and was not troubled by noise from ambulances, lumpy matresses or anything else for that matter. On the negative side, my breakfast experience was straight out of an episode of Fawlty Towers. Let me explain. I hate it when in a roomy dining area you are made sit so close to other diners you do not know that you can see their nasal hair, and this is what happened to me at the Allerton. When I suggested to the supervisor that you shouldn't sit guests on top of one another, she replied; 'it's so that you will talk'. Well, I did try to talk to the guy virtually on my table but he didn't want to which made us both uncomfortable. Note to Allerton; let people have some space in a large dining room. Other unpleasant aspects of my breakfasts included; having to ask if I could have some juice (rather than being offered some juice),being given the bill before even being asked if I wanted a cup of tea and having to plead for an extra portion of milk for my dietary breakfast cereal. Asking for the extra milk was like asking for the waiter for the pin number to his bank account. No, the staff need training and management needs a kick-up the backside for allowing these sorts of things to happen. Other irritating aspects were being told the night before that the tour booking person would be on duty the next moring when they were actually off that day and upon arriving and asking for a good place to eat, being directed to a place that required you to sell a kidney in order to finance the meal.

The thought had never crossed my mind that I wouldn't be able to get a room with 2 double beds or a queen.

The room was very nice--2 double beds--, 2 flat screen tv's, a couch, clean, roomy bathroom (shower only). I am a fitness fanatic, so I was thrilled with the fitness facility, which had several treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, multi-stations and free weights. The hotel is also just a few blocks from the river, with great running/biking trails. The hotel itself is right on the Magnificent Mile, a shopping heaven, which made for a very happy teenage daughter.

The transportation system is easy to navigate and reliable.

He had to arrive at Northwestern at 6:00 a.m. for a 7:30 a.m. start for his surgery. We had our two teenage boys (ages 16 & 14) with us and wanted to be in a hotel that was close to the hospital since we were letting them stay and sleep while I got my husband checked in at the hospital. The location of the hotel in proximity to the hospital was excellent, but that was the only positive thing about our stay at the Allerton. We arrived about 10 minutes or so before the 3:00 p.m. check-in time on Sunday afternoon. I attempted to check in, but the young man at the front desk, Alex, said that our room (I had booked a King Junior Suite) wasn't ready yet. He said it was clean, but still needed to be checked before we could use it. I was fine with that since we were a few minutes early and it wasn't a problem with us to wait a little while. After we had been waiting in the lobby for an hour, I went up to the front desk and spoke with Alex again, asking him if he had any news on our room. He said that he kept calling to see if it was ready, but it wasn't yet. I went back to sit with my husband and two boys, but I could tell that they were starting to get frustrated as well. Another 45-50 minutes passed before my husband, who isn't in the best health right now and was a bit nervous about his surgery the following day, went to the front desk to inquire about our room only to be told that it wasn't clean yet. This was disappointing news to hear, especially to my husband as he really needed to lay down and rest after the trip to Chicago and the situation was stressing him out. He even tried calling the hotel to speak with a manager, but was directed to the front desk and wasn't offered an opportunity to speak with the manager. About 10 minutes or so after he called, a person came up to my husband and finally gave him key cards to a room and said that it was an upgrade. We got to the room (#1514) and it looked just like the picture I saw online of the King Junior Suite (which is what I had booked), so I called the front desk to see if it really was an upgrade and they said, \"Yes, it is an upgrade. You have one of our specialty suites.\" I said okay, thanked the gentleman on the phone, and hung up. The room was definitely on the small side and I didn't feel that we got a good value for the $299.00 that we paid for the room, including the dismal check-in events. The bathroom was small and, considering that there were 4 of us in the room, it would have been nice to have something more than a small shelf above the sink to put our toiletry items. After my husband rested a bit, we headed out to dinner at Gino's East on the next street over from the Allerton. It was nice that the hotel was close to the restaurant and we loved the pizza and appetizers (calamari & spinach and artichoke dip with crusty garlic bread) we ate there. The service was wonderful as well...we would definitely eat there again!! Our oldest son and my husband went back to the hotel to rest their full bellys after dinner and our youngest son and I ventured out on Michigan Avenue to find the movie set area where they were filming Transformers 3. After we saw the movie set and took some pictures of it and the Transformer cars we headed back to the hotel. The boys were going to be sharing a pull-out couch to sleep on that night, so I told them to get it ready for the night. They pulled out the bed, only to find a bare mattress. I started looking around the room for sheets for the pull-out and was only able to find an extra blanket and a pillow, so I called down to the front desk to request some sheets for the pull-out and they said that housekeeping would be up right away with the sheets. I thanked the gentleman, hung up the phone, and waited...and waited...and waited. After about 30 minutes, I called down to the front desk again to say that housekeeping hadn't brought the sheets and that I had two boys that needed to get to sleep and it was getting late (11:30 at night), so if they could bring the sheets soon, I would really appreciate it. It took another 10 minutes for housekeeping to bring the sheets to our room. The gentleman did offer to put the sheets on the bed for us and I told him thank you, but it wasn't a problem for me to do it, so I took the sheets from him and made the bed myself. We did have to put the coffee table in a corner of the room in order to be able to give the pull-out enough room on the floor. Also, there was only about 6 -8 inches between the end of the pull-out bed and the wall to walk, which I thought was pretty narrow of an area to have to navigate in the dark. The next morning, my husband and I took turns getting ready in the small bathroom before we headed to Northwestern for his surgery. On the way to the elevator, my husband noticed something in a corner and pointed it out to me. I looked down to where he had pointed and saw a huge brown cockroach that was about 1 1/2 inches long! That sealed it, we decided at that moment that we were never going to stay at the Allerton Hotel again! The check-out process did go smoothly and an extra charge for internet use (we only had 1 use, not 2) that was on our bill was promply removed without incident. I was disappointed with our stay at the Allerton Hotel, partly because my husband and I had stayed there for a getaway 11 years ago and had loved the hotel and staff when we were there before and we were looking forward to that experience again. Sadly, we didn't get to have that same experience with our boys this time. Since my husband's medical team is located at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and we will be making frequent trips to Chicago for his care, we will occasionally need a peaceful place to rest and stay overnight. Unfortunately, due to our most recent experience there, it will not be at the Allerton Hotel. For his next appointment, which is this coming Tuesday, July 27, 2010, we will be spending the night at The Avenue Crowne Plaza, which is next door to the Allerton Hotel and is just a bit closer to Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

We had never been to Chicago before, arrived after dark, and for simplicity, valet parked in the garage next to the hotel. We were quickly checked in and had a room on the 15th floor with a king bed, desk, tv, and a view of the fire escape. There was nothing spectacular about the room & it didn't seem very modern or contemporary except for the Ipod docking station that is too small for an Iphone. The room was nicely sized but the bathroom was very very tiny. It is adequate for 2 people that don't plan on spending much time in the room because the location is excellent. The beds are firm, but I like firm; pillows very lumpy, and the walls very thin. Or we could have possibly just had loud neighbors. When I got into bed it looked like there was a smudge of makeup or something on the coverlet. I just moved the sheet over it. The problem we experienced was at checkout. We had booked the room by calling the hotel after researching prices online at expedia.com & at the Allerton's website. Their website advertises best price guarantee. Well we found a significantly cheaper price on expedia, called and they agreed to match it. On our confirmation email, it had a different price, but at the bottom was a notation with the guaranteed rate that was found on expedia. The bill that we received under our door on the day of checkout had the higher price and at checkout we mentioned this and asked for the bill to be corrected. The employee was not very friendly, made us wait while he shuffled through a number of other papers before he tapped the employee standing next to him to look at our email confirmation. The other employee then asked us for proof of that price and told us we needed a printout of the expedia rates. After explaining that nothing like that was mentioned when booking the room and if it had been we would have just booked through expedia to simplify the process, he told the employee that had been helping us at first to change it. This took at least 10 minutes, we received no apology for the inconvenience, weren't asked about our stay, and were not thanked for staying there. I feel that this is very poor customer service.

The location is ideal - close to the main shopping areas, with bus and El routes very close. If you're travelling from O'Hare, the best route seems to be taking the blue line to Jackson, then the red line to Chicago, or catch a 66 bus. The buses are modern, and the stops are announced, which makes it nice and easy. You need Michigan and Huron, if you're taking the bus. When I asked the route to the attractions I wanted to see, the desk clerks were friendly and helpful. My room was a little more stylish than the average hotel room, and wasn't that depressing brown many hotels use. Black, cream and blue were the main colors. I did have some problems when I arrived - the window in my room wouldn't close and the TV didn't work, but an engineer arrived within half an hour and put it all to rights, and I didn't have any more trouble. I had to use the Internet to keep in touch, but didn't use the paid version in my room. The lobby area was comfortable, but I have to say that the signal was lousy.

Meanwhile, our luggage was more or less sitting unsupervised in the foyer. The doorman and the other person in the foyer were never really able to keep total control over our property.

I give very poor marks for this part of the check-in procedure. Check-out/Departure Car return and luggage pick-up was efficient and staff was courteous. Guestroom We had booked a double room. The decor was pleasant, but the set-up was poorly planned. After a long day I would have liked to lie down in bed and watch some TV. Due to the set-up that was not possible (bed faced the windows but TV was on another wall away from the beds. I had to sit at the desk in order to watch TV. I changed rooms explaining my disappointment and was given promptly another room. Thinking this resolved the issue, I gladly accepted, only to find out it was the same kind of room (set-up) only several floors up. I checked with the front desk again and only then it was explained to me that this type of room has this particular set-up. When I reserved the room on your website there was never the mention of such an awkward and inconvenient design. If I had known I would have never booked this type of room. Also, the bathroom had no bathtub and most importantly, hardly any space to place toiletries for all of us. I had to keep everything in the room on the desk. Even my husband had no room for his few items. Decor was nice but the room has a poor layout and not enough room. The room is more adequate for one person than for 2 adults and 2 small children.

The location is great and the decor is wonderful but there is more to it. The price/value ratio is off. Also, standard these days is at least a coffee maker and a small refrigerator in the room (even cheap motels have that), and $3.00 for a bottle of water. Wow. Thank goodness there is a Walgreens just around the corner!! ! For a hotel in this price class, that should have been complementary and is not acceptable. Overall I am disappointed with my stay.

Having stayed in many hotels in Europe, I'm used to small rooms, but this felt especially cramped.

For two people it just really didn't work. I think the room would have been perfect for one person. I was also a bit disappointed in the charge for internet in the room. With two people, both with laptops staying three nights, that would have really added up. While wireless was free in the lobby, it is inconvenient to pack up the laptop and bring it down there. Plus it was a challenge to find an outlet near seating areas. I would have rated it a five on cleanliness except on the first morning that I woke up, I went to throw away something in the trash bin under the desk, and there was a pop bottle and chip wrapper in there that did not come from us. Overall the staff was welcoming and helpful. My one complaint would be at the bar in the lobby where the bar tender acted as if he were doing us a favour to wait on us. I wasn't too impressed with that. Nor was I impressed with the 18% gratuity automatically added to our bar tab.

Second, the rooms can be small. I had a corner room on the 11th floor, which measured roughly 9 x 11, leaving little room beyond that taken by the bed and desk. There was virtually no drawer space, and the closet and bathroom were also tight. For one person, it was acceptable, in a European/sailboat kind of way. The room itself was nicely done, with fairly good quality bedding and finishes. In talking with other guests, I got the impression that other rooms were somewhat larger, though not expansive.

The red line CTA station was also just a short walk away! Yes the elevators are very small, occasionally had to wait awhile for one, but figured I'm on vacation, what's the rush anyway?! Didn't eat in the restaurant, prices are steep esp. for a cup of coffee. But complimentary coffee is available in the lobby every morning.

For example, after hours of sightseeing the first day, when we arrived back to the hotel our luggage was still not brought upstairs. When I called down to the front desk they apologized and immediately had someone bring it to us. The man that delivered the bags then gave us tips on where to go for some decent Chicago pizza!

I have no complaints about the hotel, but will list some things that maybe could have been a little better, but did not at all make my stay any less special or comfortable! 1. bathroom was small, toilet takes up too much space next to the shower, there is only a small shelf above the sink for toiletries, and a magnifying mirror poorly placed right behind the door, so it got hit every time we opened the door!.....shower head was a little low for a person above 5'9..but great water pressure! 2. elevators were slow at times, and smaller than normal (but could easily fit 5 people or so)...if you've been to a small European hotel, these elevators will seem huge :) 3. breakfast menu is ridiculously overpriced 4. internet is NOT free in rooms, but FREE in the lobby and business center. 5. towels and bathroom were not very soft. 6.

To say we were disappointed is an understatement. I visit Chicago many many times a year and often stay at many other fine hotels on the Magnificient Mile. I had yet to stay at the Allerton, and can tell you it will be the last time. I can say one thing..it is in a great location. That is the extent of the pro's. This was my girlfriends first time to Chicago and I was so excited for them to experience an old hotel like the Allerton, however now I am embarrassed. From the time we arrived (it was pouring down rain) the valet and bellman could not be bothered to help us. We had to unload our entire car ourselves, and then actually yell to get their attention to come and valet the car. You would think at almost $50 a night for valet they would be somewhat attentive. They did not offer to take our bags to the room or even hold the door, the bellboys continued to have a conversation amongst themselves why they watched us struggle in the pouring rain. We then went to the 2nd floor (odd for checkin) to the front desk, and was greeted by a lady whose name escapes me. She was pleasant enough, but seemed uninterested with the problems we had. I explained to her what had happened and she offered us a \"free breakast\" which was insulting as it was only the smallest continental breakfast I have ever seen, toast , crossaint, and juice and coffee. But for $5 additional you can upgrade to an even more disappointing buffet. So back at this point, we had found a \"great rate\" on priceline.com in which I had paid full price or I would have just left right then out of sheer principle,. but we couldnt. Once we got in the tiny tiny elevator, and made it to our room I was fuming. I have never had to drag my own luggage, soaked by rain to my room at a hotel of this caliber on a Thursday evening at almost 9pm. We opened the room, and I thought it was a bad joke. There were 2 double beds, in which you could barely walk by them., The tv was in a position that you could not watch from bed. The bathroom was a larger joke, no counter space and the shower had ZERO pressure. It seemed like I was in a bad movie. The beds had feather mattresses and were extremely uncomfortable. One more pro for the hotel was that they offered 2 glasses of wine in their bar for happy hour, but the bartender was totally aloof and arrogant. Then the topper was there was one tiny bar of soap in the bathroom for the shower, but none for the sink. They also wanted to charge for internet access in the room. But if you want to drag your laptop to the lobby you can have it free there. The hotel has been remodeled, and is very clean. But it is clear that management allows customer service to be at the very bottom of their priority. I have traveled extensively for business and leisure, and am accustom to hotels that appreciate our business and treat us as guests. Unless this is the last available hotel on the magnificent mile, I would recommend NOT giving them your money.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - Great service\u201d", "Author": "Christina926", "ReviewID": "UR45723538", "Content": "Three friends recently stayed at the Allerton for fun.

The Allerton's sign at the top of the building gives a traveler a hint of what the Allerton is - the Tip Top Room used to be one of the hottest clubs during the big band era and the hotel retains much of that Art Deco feeling. It has real character. But, built for single travelers, the rooms are tiny - \"petite classic\" was the description of my room. It was bijou, but spotlessly clean, nicely laid out and with all of the upscale amenities - lcd tv, wireless internet, robe, room service, etc. The fluffy comforter on the bed was perfect for a chilly Chicago night. Despite the small room, it looked out over Michigan Avenue with great views of the Magnificent Mile. The bathroom was beautifully done with retro style tiling and fixtures (great showerhead), but there was no shelf or space for toiletries which really undermines the feeling of luxury.

No locks to the doors leading to the stairs. Yes, your room door is locked, but would you want to take the chance of being on the hotel floor by yourself with an intruder?

I attempted to contact in-house reservations prior to check-in to discuss adjusting my rate (I felt a bit entitled as I was booking for an entire week at the end of a miserable Chicago winter), but I never received a call back. Due to the circumstances surrounding my trip, I didn't have a lot of time to badger management about this issue, so I let it be and hoped that the hotel would impress regardless. I will say this, the rooms are very pretty. There were some issues with peeling wallpaper, but it was not that noticeable. Beds have feather toppers and feather pillows (undisclosed on the web site), so I now have a sinus infection from a week's worth of constant exposure. On a side note, I didn't figure out that the pillows and topper were feather until nearly the end of my stay, at which point removal would only have served to make the bed more uncomfortable. These are flat, pokey featherbeds, not the high-end kind, so wear thick fleece pajamas.The ice machine noises the AC was making when I arrived were easily remedied by turning climate control off. The windows are a nightmare, don't open them. This hotel is right across from Northwestern Hospital, so be prepared for ambulance noises at all hours. I guess if you are a big shopper, the location could be a selling point. For us, beyond being nice to look at, this place is absolutely not worth your time at the price. My first room (standard king) was very spacious, plenty of room for yoga, and it even had a chair and a bench. Unfortunately, it was also right next to the elevator. I grew up in a town with trains and planes, so I got used to the whooshing fairly quickly. However, the doors here do not go all the way to the floor, and they are thin, thin, THIN! I rolled up a towel and shoved it under the door as a sound barrier, but it made no difference at all. After the second night of no sleep due to loud conversations outside my door at all hours of the evening, I insisted on being moved. The gentleman at the front desk did not argue about switching my room, but he did point out that there was no way he could prevent people from having conversations outside my door in the future, regardless of location. Between exhaustion and frustration, I had to talk myself back from punching him in the jaw. Why would people randomly stand around MY ROOM, assuming that my room wasn't located at the gateway for entering or leaving the floor? Really. Room 2, also a standard king, was much smaller, and was one of those rooms with a door joining it to the room next door. Remember how thin those doors were? Our neighbors loved Ray LaMontagne, acoustic guitar singalongs, and noisy sex. Yay! I could not bear the thought of moving again, and they at least kept it quiet most of the night. This is the room I was in when my husband got into town, and it's the one we stayed in the remainder of our trip. It was a bed to sleep in, and nothing more.

It's poorly designed. Once on site, the internet is supposed to be available for $9.95 a night, which I always find surprising when you can get free internet now at so many other locations. I was still going to pay it but then couldn't get on. The front desk passed me off to a \"tech support\" person who tried for 10 minutes to get me signed on. I finally just said \"Never mind.\" They slid my bill under the door overnight and I noticed that - besides the Park and Play rate - they had charged also for parking! I immediately called the front desk and was told, \"Well, they fix that on check-out.\" Like I would know that?

I turned the thermostat down to 65 but still was warm all night. Admittedly I like to sleep when it's colder so I realize not everyone will care about this.

This is an older Chicago hotel that my grandmother told me she often visited for lunch as a young woman. It is right on the Miracle Mile of N. Michigan Ave., just south of Water Tower Place mall and in the middle of tons of shopping and fancy hotels. I got a competitive midweek rate on Hotwire (130) for a 4-star hotel. The hotel is only a few blocks from the State Street Subway, which connects to the Elevated Line to Midway, making it a $2 easy and cheep connection from the airport. I checked in at 11 pm, no problems. I did not use the restaurant or bar. Concierge has maps of the area. Free coffee and decaf in the am (in the Lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no coffee pots in room), complementary hot cider at night. The room was small, but clean. View of the Hancock Bldg and Watertower Place, 1 and 2 blocks north, respectively. The bed was firm and comfortable with soft pillows and warm linens. Temperature was controlled from a thermostat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no noise from the unit. Flat screen TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could not really watch it from the bed since it was 90-degrees from the bed, blocked by the desk if lying down. Actually, to get to the far side of the bed, one would have to climb over it or negotiate a 1-foot margin between the foot of the bed and the wall. Adequate closet space. No fridge, unfortunately since there are lots of good deep dish pizza places near by & I had leftovers. Bathroom was small but had plenty of shelf space, power-flush toilet, and an excellent showerhead. Nice marble tiles and the towels were fairly soft. Good bar of soap, lasted 6 days (I took it to my next stop). Shampoo, shower gel, lotion, hair dryer and conditioner provided. No bathrobes. My room was tucked behind the elevator, but I never heard it. Minimal street noise, despite being on Michigan Ave. The only problem in the room was that the carpet was coming up near the bathroom, and I kept stepping on carpet tacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ouch. The exercise room is 24 hours and had nice machines, free weights, and water + apples. Check out was simple and fast. I would not call this place 4 stars, but I got it for $150 less than the conference hotel down the street. Again, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 min walk from the subway, 10 min walk from the loop, 20 min walk to Old Town/Lincoln Park, and in the middle of the Michigan Ave Shops.

The parking fee is over $50 per night and it can take up to a 1/2 hour to get your car from the valet. There is no self-park option, so you not only have to pay the large fee, but you feel obligated to tip the man who brings you your car since it's not his fault the fee is so high.

They have people waiting outside to park your car if you like. We actually went just a little ways down Huron and used the self-park. It was just a block away and much cheaper than using valet. You come in on ground level then go to floor 2 for check in. The elevators are very small and you will have a lot of people packed in each one, but they are not slow - just a lot of stops. We were on the 15th floor and you can see the Sears/Hancock Tower from there. We ate dinner at Ditka's (near the Tower) and had awesome prime rib and filet. The bar side is pretty noisy. We wished they would have put us on the other side but the food was so good, we didn't mind. You can walk to Navy Pier from the hotel (a looong walk) but we did it. We had gorgeous weather so we wanted to take advantage of it. They have a huge ferris wheel, mini golf, and tons of food stands. I would have loved to ride the ferris wheel but had no luck talking my husband into it.

Based on the previous reviews I'd seen here, I was nervous about my planned three-night stay there. As it turned out, I was right to be. To say that the room is small is an understatement. The floorplans on the hotel website seriously misrepresent the room size. Our room has one queen-size bed, and space only for one night table--I guess two people aren't allowed to read in bed at the same time. The bathroom is similarly small but adequate. The two bath towels, however, are more worthy of a Best Western than a supposedly 4-star hotel. Ragged, thin, and misshapen. I've never been a hotel that does not provide two bars of soap--one for the bath and one for the sink....until now. Yes, there is a tiny bottle of shower gel--I guess my husband and I are supposed to take showers on alternate days during our stay. Wallpaper in the bathroom is peeling. All day long, there have been large plastic bags of dirty linen in the hallway. I've never seen that kind of thing at 4 PM at a 4-star property. Internet is $9.99/day and is wired DSL, not wireless. There's one telephone in the room, located on the desk. I guess we can fumble across the room (all of two steps) when our wakeup call comes. The elevators have been discussed by others. Tiny, slow to come, and apparently one or two are always out of service. Just try not to visit during flu season--it's hard to avoid skin-to-skin contact on most elevator rides here. I will admit that the location of the Allerton can't be beat. But this is seriously the smallest hotel room I have ever been in, bar none. I feel like I'm in a garret, not a hotel. The amenities are limited--no fridge, miserable towels, a phone that has seen better days. I would say to management: Why not just drop the pretense to being a 4-star property?

The hotel itself is \"OK\" - rooms are average, location, pretty good, service, OK as well. But here is my most recent experience. I booked a room for one night in July, \"guaranteed,\" through Orbitz, and arrived for check in to learn that the hotel had \"overbooked.\" The front desk clerk asked whether I would consent to taking a complimentary room at a hotel 8 blocks away, PLUS a refund of the $ I had paid for the room at the Allerton - meaning in essence, a night free. It was a hot July evening and against my better judgment after a long day on the road, but I accepted - schlepped my bags the 8 blocks. At least I had the good sense to take the name of the clerk and the Director of Sales . . . the former had assured me that the refund would appear on my credit card \"within a couple of days\" - which of course, it did not. So I contacted the DOS via email and he assured me he would follow up with Orbitz, which who knows if he did . . . but I told him that truly, this was not Orbitz's responsibility: Orbitz did its job. It was the hotel that overbooked its rooms and then made me an offer it did not live up to. Suffice it to say, there has been no refund of the $187+, and I will never stay at the Allerton again, and recommend that no one reading this stay there either.

In addition, all of our special requests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mini fridge added to room, a tub in bathroom and a pullout couch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were all fulfilled! We were told when we checked in there were no fridges currently available but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the room 15 minutes and housekeeping brought one in. We were on the eighth floor overlooking the Mag Mile, we had seven windows in our room including the one in the bathroom, which we liked a lot. The bathroom was very large and there was adequate storage space for clothes in the closet and drawers in the room. The staff were all very attentive and friendly, especially the doorman who said hi to us every time he saw us. Check in and out was a breeze, and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long at all for them to get our car out of the valet when we were leaving the last day. Yes, the elevators were a bit funky and a couple of times we missed one that is a bit separate from the others and had a good laugh when we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch the door before it closed, but the wait wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that bad except for maybe peak times of day (around 5ish when everyone in the hotel tended to be heading out). Actually since we were on the 8th floor a couple of times when I left the room by myself I simply walked down the stairs instead. I attended a conference while at the Allerton and found the food to be very good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although we never did get room service. We would return to the Allerton, we got a great rate on the suite booking directly thru the hotel.

Also, the Wendella boat trip which included the river and lake was great. We found Chicago very beautiful with hardly any litter. The people of Chicago were also very helpful to tourists. We asked a gentlemen for directions and noticed a few minutes later that he borrowed a bicycle to catch up with us to redefine his directions--amazing. The folks at the hotel were also very helpful. Thanks to Jon (doorman) for recommendating Park Grille at the Park and for Tyrone and the front desk staff for good service, and the folks in the dining room which ran a first-class operation. We only had the buffet breakfast, but it was superb and managed very well. We also ate at Gino's East, which we enjoyed for Chicago Pizza. Be ready to wait for about an hour for their deep dish pizza. Ask the concierge for a coupon for free bread sticks there, which were very good and filled the void until the pizza came.

We found that the Allerton suited our basic needs for a reasonably-priced, safe, clean and centrally-located hotel. I can see, though, why other reviewers have been disappointed, especially if they paid for and expected an above-average stay. Our positives: We could not have asked for a better location. The hotel is amongst various luxury boutiques along Michigan Avenue and is a few blocks away from the Hancock Observatory. We also found it quite easy to access the Loop as the hotel is within walking distance to two El Train stops along the red line. We appreciated that the hotel was quiet in the evenings, even with the bustle of Michigan Avenue outside our window. Our room was clean, and the staff was courteous. Our negatives: We heeded earlier warnings about the small rooms and so booked a \"standard\" room rather than the \"petite.\" Unfortunately, we still found our room to be unbelievably small; it was almost comical. Like other reviewers, also were a bit confused by the various sets of elevators in the hotel, and on one occasion, we waited nearly 10 mins for a lift to arrive on our floor to take us down to the lobby. Finally, on our last day, we received several reminders to check-out, including a knock at the door at 8 a.m. by someone delivering a bill for our stay. Again, my boyfriend and I had very basic expectations in a hotel, and thus were willing to overlook the negatives of our stay because of the Allerton's great location and price (we paid about $128/night).

The reviews and the hotel's own info left it unclear what size bed to expect - anywhere from barely bigger than a twin to a queen. Also, some reviews said the rooms were Euro-tiny. Maybe we lucked out - both of our rooms were ample in size and had double beds (check-in clerk said they were queen, but I don't think so). The rooms had been refurbished recently with warm yellow paint and updated, modern bathrooms. Though smaller than the average hotel room, the layout is nice and the room felt cozy in addition to sufficiently roomy. It has an armoire, desk, and closet. Our 16th-floor rooms faced south with a nice view. There are no blackout shades, however. The drapes don't pull shut all the way; only sheers cover the windows entirely. I actually left my sheers open, too, to enjoy the view as I fell asleep. My 7-year-old niece bunked in the closet! It was big enough to make a pillow-bed for her, and we draped a cover over the doors to make it like a tent. She loved it. I loved having the bed to myself. Though we were right by the elevators, we didn't have any issues with noise in the least. It was totally quiet. The staff was very nice. Those on site were nicer than my reservation agent, whom I spoke to before deciding to book on hotels.com ($10 cheaper per night). Valet parking is steep - $45. I think self-park is at least a block away, and we arrived on a cold, snowy night so we forked over for valet. Didn't try the restaurant, though my sister remembers loving the breakfast buffet.

The room was very clean; linens were Crowne Plaza style (left over from the change of flags, I guess). A rollaway bed was brought for Kiddo, and fit nicely. They had Gilchrist & Soames toiletries, which was very nice. We needed a fridge for milk and apple juice for Kiddo, and one was brought up and plugged in at no charge.

Hotel/Room: The hotel is old/historical looking from the outside. But it has been recently refurbished. Other reviews stated that the elevator only went to the lobby and you needed to transfer out. This has all changed. You can now ride the elevator from street level to your room. I had a room on the 19th floor. It was on the small side (had two beds) but was tastefully decorated.

The bathroom was nicely decorated and the shower had great water pressure. No fridge in the room but a desk in between the beds. Small closet with a safe. Location: This was one of the best features. Right on Michigan Ave. A couple blocks away from everything including: Giordano's Pizza, Water tower mall, John Hancok, and a bunch of other great shopping stores. You could walk to pretty much anything. Service: I had booked for 1 king bed but at the last minute needed two beds. The hotel stated that they were sold out and couldn't make the change.

I went back down to the front desk to tell them about the smell and the clerk told me that it was impossible that the room smelled of smoke since it was a non smoking room. Interesting logic but not a good answer. Her solution was to have housekeeping come up and spray perfume all over the room. Again, not a good solution.

We were given a junior suite on the 20th floor that was wrapped back around a corner far from the elevator. It was extremely quiet and peaceful. The only unusual thing about the suite was the door opened to the sleeping area and not the sitting room. There was a spanking clean bathroom inbetween rooms with a nice sized shower and plenty of room for toiletries on the shelf over the pedestal sink. The usual amenities were available - coffee maker (1 cup), hair dryer, iron. Two thick, plush bathrobes were provided. The room spanned one of the north jutouts thus giving us a view from three sides. There were plenty of windows to let in lots of light. Lined curtains kept the rooms dark in the morning. The third floor is beautiful, with high ceilings and dark, detailed wood trim. Just the character I expect from an older hotel. We tried the breakfast buffet before departure - using the 20% discount coupon. I thought the selection was great and the food delicious. I would recommend giving it a try. If you use valet parking, be prepared for a $45/day charge on your bill. Next time we may drop our luggage off at the hotel and park in Grant Park. Elevators are small, which I think is quaint.

Some comments: -Like other posters on this site, I agree that the hotel is a bit outdated, but I have never had an issue it not being clean. Room size is also adequate for Chicago, esp considering the fantastic location. However, bathroom setup is usually inconvenient, with little \"vanity\" or counter space. -I frequently have an issue here with \"smoking\" vs \"nonsmoking\" rooms. Seventy-five percent of the time, I check into my supposedly nonsmoking room only to find it smells of smoke. The front desk is usually apologetic, and they quickly assign me to a new (very fresh smelling) room, but it is quite annoying to have to go through those motions. It makes me wonder - why can't they assign me the nonsmoking, \"fresh-smelling\" room to begin with? -Do not bother with the restaurant/bar with all of the other great Chicago places so close... -As someone else mentioned, you have to take an elevator to the 3rd floor to check in, and then take a different elevator to your room. This becomes a pain when you want to leave the hotel, as you must take the elevator to the 3rd floor, and then switch to a different elevator to reach street level. The always friendly bellman told me last week that apparently beginning in October, 2007, you'll be able to take the elevator from your room right down to ground level, which would eliminate the elevator transfer, and save the hassle. Hopefully he's right! -The fitness room is interesting - on the top floor, which supposedly was the old \"Tip Top Lounge\".

I was leaning towards booking another hotel, but a friend of mine, a native Chicagoan, convinced me to book this hotel. I should have trusted my initial instincts. After checking in, I used the \"micro-sized\" elevator to get to my room. While on the elevator, I spoke with a woman who had previously stayed at this hotel. After commenting on how small the elevator was, she warned me that I just might get a room where I would open the door and run into the bed - I laughed it off not believing her. When I opened the room door, lo and behold, the bed was right there....within three steps of the doorway. The standard room in this hotel is really small. It may be okay for one person, staying for only one night. However, I was staying there for three nights and was not happy about it. Also, there was a foul odor in the hallway on the floor of my room - I contacted the front desk and requested to be moved to a different floor. Also, the standard room does not have a small refrigerator or microwave; however, it does have a micro coffee maker, enough for one cup at a time. On a positive note the hotel is relatively clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. One highlight of this hotel is its location - right on Michigan Avenue (Magnificent Mile), with tons and tons of shopping. If you're thinking about renting a car, think twice and save money. There is plenty of public transportation (buses and taxi cabs) To sum it up: If you don't mind staying in an older hotel with small standard rooms and minimal amenities, by all means stay at the Allerton Hotel.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGood location - bad hotel -- find another place to stay!!\u201d", "Author": "luvtotravel1970", "ReviewID": "UR8618805", "Content": "We stayed there for a wedding and were not in the room for very long - thank goodness!

The rate was comparable to the rate we received last year through Hotwire, but last year we were booked at the Drake. It would be unfair to compare the Allerton to the Drake, but after staying at the Drake for nearly the same amount, it was hard not to draw comparisons, or at least to not be slightly disappointed. The Allerton is in a great location, for any attractions on or near the Miracle Mile. That is a positive, the down side is you can hear much of the noise form Michigan Ave. We were in a room within earshot of some young street musicians playing plastic buckets and pails and it made it dissicult to nap late in the afternoon. The first room we were assigned was extremely small and the carpet was horribly stained with what looked like red wine or coffee ( I hope ) the vents for the heating and ac were covered in filthy dust and mold. The front desk changed our romm, and the new room was a bit larger, but the vents in that room were pretty dirty as well. The front desk must not have notified housekeeping of the cahnge, so we were dismayed to return to our room to after a long day in the city, to find it had not been cleaned. If you go into the Allerton knowing it is an older hotel, in need of many updates and refreshing then this hotels is very adequate for a good location, comfortable bed and good water pessure. The downside to the comfortable bed is an extremely loud ac unit that will jar you awake every time it turns on, paper thin walls that allow lot of corridor and nearby rooms to be heard. Hotwire ranks this as a 3.5 star hotel. I would not. I would put it closer to 2.5 and possibly a 3 star. I did not check out the fitness facility, nor did we eat at the hotel. With so many great places to eat within walking distance it seemed silly to spend the money the hotel prices reflected.

If wasn't for the location, probably would rate it a star lower. The not so good: Front desk staff and doorman were not customer service oreinted for this level of hotel (re: Allerton is not charging Best Western rates...). Seemed very odd that the doormen just stare at everyone and only offer a salutation AFTER the guest(s) offer one. Rooms have beeb refurbished over the years, yet redeem tired signs. Although our room was on a high floor, the view was diminished by very dirty windows. They could invest in some badly needed window cleaning. Elevators can be cramped and you will be intimate with other guests whether by choice or not due to everyone squishing into the hot elevators. Really a matter of preference here though--if in a hurry, you will be inconvenienced. Otherwise, you might just find them interesting from a historic standpoint.

Also, its one of those great, grand old red-brick buildings which I find beautiful - yet the inside was clean and modern looking so it made for a very enjoyable experience. I don't like when people complain of the room size because I thought it was a pretty good-sized room compared to some hotels in big cities like New York, Boston, etc - now THOSE are small rooms! And the cleanliness and cuteness of the rooms make up for it - the bed was very comfortable and the cleaning staff should be commended also for their customer service. There were a few times that a cleaning woman held an elevator for us. However, they are the only staff that seems to care at all for customer service as the rest of the staff leaves something to be desired for. Everytime I called the hotel for help, I was directed to a voicemail system. I believe that a concierge should always be available - especially considering I was checking which subway stop to get off of and I was on the subway at the time so I really needed help quickly! Plus I had to call on a question when I got home and the accounting dept and operators were all pretty rude to me. Otherwise, I think this is a great hotel to stay at - they might do better if they have a staff overhaul & get some powerful customer service reps in there. As for the elevators, yes, they're a bit small, and a little slow but really nothing THAT horrible - you just get the next elevator if its got a few people in it already and I don't recall waiting for much longer than 5 minutes at the most for any of the elevators.

If you are the kind of traveler who demands opulence and huge ornate lobbies and rooms- you won't like it here. Second- the \"lobby\" on the hotel is on the 3rd floor, and you must take 1 elevator to the 3rd floor and get off to get on another to go up to your room. This is a remnant of how hotels worked 1/2 a century a go. Some might find this irritating- my wife and I found it added to the charm. Whenever I reserve a room in an OLD hotel, I worry if it will feel old- musty- in need of refurbishment. Not here. The rooms and all comon areas have been refurbished and we found them charming. The staff was just great- great service with a smile and without an attitude. The location is simply the best in Chicago- right on the Mag MIle sandwiched between the Water Tower on one side and the Apple Store on the other. The only negatives we found were (1) no small fridge in the room, so left overs went to waste; (2) $10 internet charge per day (but this is almost standard in nicer hotels); (3) parking is expensive- $30/ night (again it is everywhere around this neighborhood); and (4) the hotel is close to Northwestern University Hospital ER, so occasional ambulances during the early AM (this could be a plus for some if your health is so-so). If 5 star to you means everything opulent- the best- regardless of price- go across the street to the Peninsula or Park Hyatt and spend an extra $250/night. But if your definition of 5-Star includes value for the dollar (and you can see small rooms and funky elevators as charming vestigial remnants of an earlier era rather then irritating) then the Allerton is hard to beat!

Received a notice from Travelzoo about a good weekend deal that turned out to be $108 per night. Turned out to be perfect. At $108 per night, our expections weren't very high.

We were able to walk to Millenium Park, the Hancock Center, Navy Pier, the St. Pat's parade and the numerous restuarants and clubs in the area. We didn't shop but Michigan Ave appears to have everything covered there from Tiffany's to Saks to Brooks Brother, Apple, etc. A previous poster mentioned the 3rd floor lobby as a negative. We found it to be a positve. It's off the street and was a pleasant surprise. The lounge on the second floor was also very nice. Great bartender. We didn't use the restaurant. There are many, many hotels within a few blocks of the Allerton. My guess is that the rates on those are much higher. If you're looking at a short stay and are looking for a decent hotel, i'd recommend the Allerton. We took some other advice and took the Blue Line train from the airport. It was inexpensive compared to a taxi but it takes forever to get downtown. I counted 19 stops on the train. You then have to transfer to the red line for 5 more stops and then walk about 1/4 mile. Returning to the airport on Sunday was comical. The traiin became so crowded that people couldn't get on the train at stops on the way.

The customer service experience was scary: a bunch of personnel conspiring against me to cover up a mistake and escalating the matter instead of simply apologizing. You have to remember even at a relatively upscale hotel like this, you are dealing against a group of individuals who know each other and will keep working together after you leave. They can collectively act against you by covering up and even lying for each other. Especially, you have to watch out for the team at this hotel. They made a mistake in my reservation so they told me that I have to come to registration and check out after the second day and check back in with an accompanying key change at 7 am on Sunday (because I had back-to-back meetings all day). Don't underestimate this as the Crown Inn Customer Service, hotel manager, front desk manager, receptionist, and the security did. All these people, in mixed order, told me that this should not be a problem for me and I have to shut up and not complain. First, it took a long time to explain to the morning receptionist my problem as the previous receptionist had explained to me the day before. Then, she apologized to the people behind me in the checkout line but not to me and insisted that this is not a problem. So I remarked that she should first apologize to me and complained about waiting for fifteen minutes already due to an uncalled for check-out check-in at 7 am on Sunday while I am trying to catch a meeting. When she gave up because she could not overcome the complexities of their reservation system, she called for her manager. The front desk manager arrived to solve the problem. He said that this is not a problem. When I told him he should apologize for their mistake, he accused me of throwing a pen at him -which I had put on the desk after signing my new papers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he called for security. The security came and told me to shut up or he would call the police. Of course, I was late to my meeting. Afterwards, when we come back to our room at about midnight, it was not properly made. When I contacted the Crown Inn Corporate after the stay, they apologized briefly (better than the fellows at the hotel who did not apologize until I asked) but implied that they were OK to be rude because I raised my voice at their incompetence. They also said that the room was not properly made because of an oversight and not retaliation and asked whether I contacted the room service at that time. On the positive, Allerton is right on Michigan Avenue and in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. The rooms are small but nice very clean fairly good sound isolation for the age of the building.

However, this particular time I was desperate. My husband & I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and wanted to do something, so we decided on a weekend stay in Chicago. Because our anniversary date was at the start of a holiday weekend (Labor Day), it was almost impossible to find a suitable hotel. So I found Crowne Plaza via HOTWIRE (who rated Crowne at 3.5 Stars) and was quote a price of $120 per night. Imagine my disappointment to see a hotel room on the Magnificent Mile to be so small. The lobby was OK, but if you are unfamiliar with Chicago, it may be sort of tricky to find the Crowne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front door (which is actually on Huron \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not Michigan Avenue). I agree with the other ratings which say the elevators are extremely small. My husband (6ft 5in) had to duck to get into the tiny car. The rooms were extremely clean. We had a partially obscured view of Michigan Avenue. Our room door (ROOM 724) literally sat 4 feet away from the elevator doors. We had dinner in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BIG MISTAKE!!!! The restaurant is called TAP ON TWO and it was horrible.

When booking our suite, I had asked that a refrigerator be in the room, when we arrive. I was told they did have refrigerators and they would try to accommodate me. A few days before we were supposed to go to Chicago I had spoken to someone on the phone from this hotel, that I thought was with concierge services, asking if they did anything special for people's birthdays. I told the gentleman my birthday was our day of arrival. He told me they could do something and then asked me what our estimated time of arrival was. I told him around 10 o'clock in the morning. When we arrived at the hotel, at noon, we had to take a small elevator up to the third floor for check in. No problem. Then, we took another set of ( small and slow) elevators up to our suite. I am now extremely excited thinking everything will be perfect for my birthday! What a major disappointment to find NO REFRIGERATOR and NO BIRTHDAY SURPRISE. Also, to find out later that this guy that was supposedly with concierge services was really a bellman! When I went to talk to the guest relations manager, Brian, I pulled out my Priority Club Membership card and told him that this card apparently means nothing at this hotel. I had spoken to him about the refrigerator, as well as the birthday surprise.He tried to get me a refrigerator that day, but was unsuccessful. We finally got it on Friday evening.(we arrived on Wed.) As for the birthday surprise.. later in the evening of our day of arrival, someone brought up a little basket of fruit, which was kind of frozen, along with a bottle of merlot wine and a card wishing me a happy birthday from the staff. It was more like an afterthought. There was also a problem with staff and late check-out. I was given three different times that I could check out. Once again, I had to call down to Brian to clarify/rectify the situation. He allowed us a later time for check out. Thank you, Brian! I will probably not give this hotel a second chance. To me first impressions are extremely important. Also, when you pay a lot for a Suite, you should automatically have a fridge IN the suite. You should NEVER have to request one, much less pay to rent one! (Are you listening Crowne Plaza?) Also, staff should be taught how to handle guests. I can say a couple of nice things about this place. It was a nice touch to have a relaxation CD and a little package with lavender spray for linens, an eye mask and ear plugs. The restaurant was great. Food was wonderful and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. Wait staff was friendly. Also, our suite was very nice. (See pictures) Housekeeping was great!

The hotel is a landmark hotel, which in reality translates into tiny, slow elevators and an excuse to keep re-using hideous fabric from the '70s. Check-in was fine, front desk was courteous. Only complaint was that my request for a king-size bed was ignored, but I was traveling solo, so settled agreeably for a queen. My room was small, but functional and comfortable. I used the internet before noticing a draft --coming from the window with a piece of the frame cut out! The window was completely closed, but the metal frame along the bottom was cut out. In April, it still gets quite chilly at night, so I was not about to take this in stride. In addition, the hotel is in the immediate vicinity of a hospital, so sirens from the ambulances are frequent and all the more noisy with an open window. I have never encountered something like this before, but when I called the front desk to ask for a room change, they seemed unfazed so I guess it's the norm for this hotel. I asked for a room that did not face the heavily trafficked street, but they said none were availalbe. When I switched rooms, I noticed that my new room had a breakfast menu strewn across the bed and one of the glasses had been used. I can only assume that another guest had switched from that room as well. In any case, my new room was substantially better (warmer!) than the old one and I was satisfied. Until I ordered room service. Speedy and courteous delivery, but short on taste. I ordered the french onion soup and lamb. The soup was too salty, lamb was too bland. However, I did enjoy the warm bread and fries. And the cute little bottle of Heinz. Really, it's the little things. My night was otherwise uneventful, and I slept very soundly. The bed was very comfortable, clean, and sleep-inducing.

Check-in was hassle-free, the staff was very friendly and attentive, this even though the hotel was obviously packed and busy.

Although it's far from perfect in many respects, I have to say that when we walked in and rode up the elevator to the third floor and walked into the lobby, I was reminded of some hotels where we stayed in Europe. Lovely, tall windows and a wide, pleasant seating area with a small reception desk are on the third floor before you take a different elevator up to your room. We arrived early, around 10 am. Sara checked us in and she was very pleasant. She said she didn't have a king bed at that time, but gave us a queen on the 16th floor with a view of Michigan Ave. Again, the small elevators and small hallways and the very small rooms reminded me of one hotel in particular where we stayed in Paris which just brought back a wave of memories for me. The bed took up most of the room but that was part of the charm for me. There were tall windows that you could open. We opened ours a crack for fresh air and could hear a sax being played on the corner down the street. There was coffee on a small table, a desk, small closet and safe in the tv cabinet.

Shades were helpful at night to keep out the light of the busy city but we weren't bothered by the city sounds. This hotel is close to tons of great restaurants. When we arrived, it was cold and rainy (again reminding me of Paris) so we walked a couple of blocks North (to Superior) and one block East to a little Italian place called Joey Buona's.

Great location, iffy everything else. Arrived at check-in to see a small but angry line of people. Friday evening, a line of customers....and one person working the 4-place front desk. I spent the wait trying to figure out what everyone's problem was. Turns out it was my problem, too. Depsite a King bed reservation, they had only double beds availabe. \"Anything you can do\"? No. Take it or leave it, essentially. The word \"KING\" on the reservation means nothing. This was a reservation made through the Crowne Plaza website, not a 3rd party. Not a big deal, I was expecting as much based on what I read here, but I'm posting it so the next people know. Room was nice, but small. Once we heard \"double\" we knew it was going to be tight. By small, I mean that we were re-arranging furniture for better use of space. My face was 6 feet from the door and it felt like I was sleeping in the hallway. One in our group actually got a king room (one out of 3 parties) and that's a nice room between the elevator banks. Judging by the fire escape diagram, most of the rooms look like they're the size ours was. It's an very beautiful, but old building, so if you're used to old buildings...things like water damage around the windows, tiny bugs in the room (no screens on the windows...don't open them unless you want visitors), great water pressure for 90% of the time, interspersed with a) no water pressure or b) a 20-degree change in water temperature. When leaving, the doorman waved us away from the limo we thought we were taking to the airport. \"It's For someone else\" we're told. Well after 5 mins the driver finally approaches us and we find out that is inded our limo, thanks buddy. There sure seemed to be a lot of hotels in the area, and although this was inexpensive I'm sure you could do better. Pictures attached -- I got a great shot of the hotel from a nearby apartment. I also took pics of the water damage and some streaks were I killed a few bugs on the ceiling.

No apologies to anyone, everyone was told rooms \"become available\" at the 3:00 check-in time listed on the web site. After some phone calls to housekeeping, we were told our room lacked only towels and they could let us in. The man at the counter acted like he was doing us a big favor. When we got to our room, the bed wasn't made and I couldn't tell if the bedding was clean or used. I called housekeeping and had to wait another 1/2 hour before showering so they could come fix the bed. The woman from housekeeping was incredibly nice and apologetic--and she was the only staff we met who was. By the time we were able to get out, it was nearly 8:30 and we had missed any prospect of seeing a show, which was the main reason we decided to come to Chicago for the night. When we left, a man who was next to us in line the second time was just getting his room and he was, understandably, furious. The staff were still acting like it was perfectly ok to be checking someone in that late. The room was small and a little shabby but clean. The bed was fantastic.

I've stayed at various mid-range hotels downtown and this one ranks on the bottom of my list. First off, I was traveling with a female co-worker this time. I booked 4 months in advance and had called several times requesting a room with two beds. I was told I had to make that request at check in. Well, low and behold they only had rooms with one bed. We weren't too happy and when this was mentioned, the guy at check-in seemed flippant and replied, \"Well, I can't give you what I don't have.\" The hotel and the room were clean but small and this particular room had a nice view of the fire escape. The other issue I had was their elevator system. It's an old building and while the entrance was street level, one has to take an elevator to the third floor to reach the main elevators to the rooms. The elevators are VERY slow and very small. With 23 floors of guests waiting to get upstairs, it's a rat race to get to the elevator first--or be stuck standing there as long as 5 min to get up to your room. All that said, the Allerton's saving grace is it's location--on Michagan Avenue's Magnificant Mile. As a tourist, it's a wonderful area to stay--walking distance to Oak Street Beach at one end and the Chicago river and on to business dist. of downtown at the other. Chicago is a wonderful city to be \"out and about\" in. If you're only using the Allerton as a place to rest your head, it'll be adequate. For the same price, I much prefer the Palmer House Hilton.

Every hotel in the area was booked solid. For some reason, the Allerton had several rooms available. I arrived very late, 11:30 p.m. to be exact, due to a series of unfortunate events at Chicago O' Hare. Check in took a ridiculously long time. The layout of the hotel is odd - you have to use a series of elevators to get from one area to the next, all of which have strange angles and are tiny. So I got up to my room on the 16th floor and it had not been cleaned at all since the previous occupant had left. The bed was unmade, towels on the floor, the window was open. I dragged my luggage (never saw a bellman) back to the third floor where check-in was and was given a second room, on the 20th floor. My room was larger and seemed nice. On second look there were crackers on the floor by the bed as well as some spare change. There were about 20 little bugs having a party on the ceiling, and the safe - which I didn't touch started beeping the second I got out of the shower. Did I mention that room service closed at 11:00, so no dinner for me. The blanket on the bed was stained with some chocolately looking residue. The room was dirty. I did complain and someone came and picked up the crackers and stopped the safe from beeping. I think the hotel is simply too large for the staff to handle.

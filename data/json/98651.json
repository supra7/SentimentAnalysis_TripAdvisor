As other reviewers mentioned it right next to the highway and there was some construction along the highway but one day I was working in the hotel room in the early afternoon and evening, and my room was on the side of the building closest to the highway and I still did not hear anything. The building is well built and seems really sound proof. I really enjoyed the breakfast. I've stayed at other hotels that have the waffle iron and variety of cold choices, in addition to some hot choice. But I particularly enjoyed how at this Hampton the hot option was Different each morning--eggs with fresh peppers, onions, and cheese one morning, buiscuits and gravy another morning, all of it seemed freshly made and delicious. They also kept the coffee and hot water (for tea and hot chocolate) out and filled all day so I was able to have some tea later in the day--really enjoyable. Other reviewers mentioned the Happy Hour--they did not tell me it was Monday through Thursday when I checked in on a Tuesday (they just mentioned the time it started that evening). So I was pleasantly surprised by the snacks and drinks available each night. The room was excellent, bed extremely comfortable, temperature control worked great (I think I was in room 200 or something right around there), fridge and microwave nice touch, bathroom really tastefully decorated and the cleanest bathroom in any hotel I've every stayed (no mold/mildew anywhere), great work area with desk, chair, and Internet free and worked well, and I appreciate getting shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash!! The three suggestions I have are the following: One, it would be nice if they kept a few regular plates and bowls or even paper plates and bowls so that a guest could request to use them occasionally. This is because I was in town for the entire week and had some leftover pizza in the fridge in my room, but had nothing to heat it up on in the microwave. All the hotel had was Styrofoam-type plates and bowls and things. I put the pizza on a pile of napkins (because I did not want to put Styrofoam in the microwave and get chemicals in my food). It's not a requirement but would be a nice touch to just have that available in the kitchen area if a guest asked for it. Two, the housekeeping schedule is a little strange: one of the days during the week, my meetings ended early and I got back to the hotel around 2pm, planning to work on things in my room the rest of the day. The housekeeping carts were on my floor, and when I went into my room all the towels that I had left on the floor were gone (so someone had apparently started to clean my room since they removed the dirty towels) but nothing else had been done, yet. I had a lot of work to do, so I just got to work. Some time between 4 and 4:30pm a housekeeper knocked on my door and I told her she could do whatever she needed and I would just be working at the desk. She quickly did a fantastic job cleaning but it was just awkward that they had started in my room before 2 and never actually cleaned it until hours later and were working on it so late in the day. The hotel did not seam overly crowded at all so I just did not understand why they were doing this so late in the day--since check out was at noon, why didn't they clean the rooms with people in them who were not checking out that day some time before noon and then work on the rooms that had been vacated during the afternoon? Three, be more consistent about the little things: the newspaper was left outside of rooms with people in them most mornings (There were additional copies available in the breakfast area as well), but on two of the morning I stayed there the newspaper was left in front of other people's doors but not mine. I thought that was a little strange and honestly I felt a little slighted. It's a small thing, and I did not steal the paper from in front of anyone else's room, I was just surprised. Four, I've stayed at other hotels in the area that had more dinner and other fun food options within walking distance of the hotel. I did not see any really great options on a google map of the area. Having this information more readily available for guests would be helpful. I would definitely stay here again as the staff were professional and the accommodations and breakfast fantastic.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVerry Nice\u201d", "Author": "JimDavisHouston", "ReviewID": "UR126139078", "Content": "The staff was friendly and helpful.

The gym had two treadmills, a recumbent bike, a stairstepper, and a weight machine - all in good working condition. It was cold out so I didn't take time to see the pool area. They had a breakfast buffet that was well laid out. There were biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted sweet rollls and donuts, cereals, make your own waffle, and juices. Also, prepared fruit and a basket of mixed fruite. Everything tasted fresh and the hot foods were hot and the cold foods were cold. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel. Driving access was from a back street as the street the hotel fronts on is under construction. The parking lot and hotel are directly adjacent to a LaQuinta. Coming and going out the back was not a problem and there were various stores and gas stations that were extremely convenient. The WIFI was open and my iphone worked well. The staff was helpful.

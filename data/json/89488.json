We never stay on this end of town so it was adventure for us...sorry to say we will not be back to Park Place. The area is overcrowded, overrated, and under sanitary! Pros: If you enjoy being in the heart of the most congested area of the boards - this is a charm. Arrived at 10am on Sat. room was available by 11am. Inside of the room was clean, and was cleaned timely and well daily. Heard compliants from others that the elevator was slow but we really didnt have that expereince. Front desk clerk that checked us in was very nice and professional. Bed was comfortable, pillows seemed new. Always had plenty of towells. Cons: You're in the heart of the most congested area on the boards. Pool is located on 2nd floor and is filthy. Our room was on the 5th floor directly over it and i never saw a poolman actually clean the pool or ANY of the chairs or tables on the pool deck. (see pix) We spent time waiting there while our room was being prepared Sat and everything was dirty. Bartend on the 2nd floor is rude and there was an incident where the wait staff even told us that she was rude and that they had complained to the manager about her but nothing had been done. Apparently you cannt buy two drinks with one ID - if your black. Because our 'pool nieghbor', who was white, managed to do it just fine. She was more pissed than my husband which is a fete. Really not a problem crossing it off my list of places to eat considering the place was gross - chairs and tables look as if they've never seen a wet, soapy, cloth. More cons: The balcony was dirty. Its never swept and the plastic chairs are never wiped down. No irons in the rooms. (?!?) Visited the front desk to ask where the iron may be hiding and the clerk told me she could have one 'delivered'. And she sd this straight faced like it was the most reasonable thing. NOT. Especially NOT at $220 a night. The housekeeping staff ride the same elevator as guest and dont feel obligated to speak. Good morning, good night, drop dead, \"yea, i'm on here with a huge bin of towells and now as a paying you have to wait\" - nothing. Not one housekeeping person spoke to us our entire stay. A con that i dont think the hotel is solely responsible for - This area of beach in front of the hotel is trashy. I know this probably because its so congested and busy but, they may want to invest some energy in cleaning up the area of beach. Its gross. Overall, we will not be staying here again. Even if it was the last place in town - which it was this time. Too bad, because i enjoyed the Dough Roller next to the hotel...", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fallston, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNothing spectacular\u201d", "Author": "Lilsassy", "ReviewID": "UR139404290", "Content": "Good location close to everything but poorly cleaned and maintained.

Unless you are willing to spend a fortune the hotels on the boardwalk are not even 3 star quality, especially by the end of the summer season.

On the plus side side, the location is excellent, near many attractions on the boardwalk. We stayed in Oceanfront so we could people watch from our balcony. The parking situation was also excellent, it can be a problem at many of the other hotels. There were plenty of parking spots at the hotel, we did not have to park blocks away. The staff was also very pleasant. There were no noise issues during our stay. On the minus side, the room appeared to be clean but our socks were filthy and the tiled floor felt sticky. The linen was fine, though they had comforters on the bed which I just removed. There was a problem with our balcony door not locking but they quickly fixed it. The elevators were really slow as others have mentioned.

Somehow I was under the impression this was a smoke-free hotel, not so, in fact it is a smoker's paradise. While the rooms are smoke free, the few public areas are destined to smokers: pool area, the small deck (which some 2nd floor room balconies open to and is almost like being in someone else's patio). Especially disappointing was the room balcony, so narrow it only is useful to hang out your wet stuff, don't plan to sit down and enjoy. If it rains, all you can do is sit on your bed, there is no lounge, bar or other common area to use. The room was not very clean when we checked in but they were very prompt in sending someone to fix it, and it was always cleaned properly after that, with the right amount of towels we requested. The \"kitchinette\" was just a mini microwave, a mine coffe maker, a minibar-like fridge and a sink. There is no way you can cook anything there, makes sense they do not include any bowls or pots with their dishes. A quart-size chinese take out does not fit in the microwave.

Location on the boardwalk was good for access to shopping, the weekends events and access to the beach and rides. The property had convenient parking and they allowed you to leave your car in the lot even after check out. The rugs seemed new and the linens and beds were acceptable. Any calls for extra paper products or extra linens were promptly responded to. Now the downside. Comforters could have used a washing. When returning from the beach there is no onsite rinse location so were were dragging sandy items all through the hotel all 3 days. If we ever were lost we could follow the sand to our room. As others have stated the elevators were not that great so we used the stairs a lot. We had a 5th floor room oceanfront which was a little noisy but if you are tired enough you can sleep through anything. The crowd later in the evening became a more mature teen crowd on the boardwalk which caused us to limit the time our younger kids were on the boardwalk after a certain hour. Overall for convenience the place was fine but if you are used to nicer properties this will be a bit of a letdown but as long as you go knowing it is not the Ritz and do not have high hopes you will be fine.

We went out for lunch and by the time we were finished, our room was ready. Evelyn was working the front desk and she was very friendly and professional and made us feel welcome. Our room was on the fifth floor and we had a view of the boardwalk and the beach. An added bonus is that we arrived during the Air Show, and we had a great view of the air show from our balcony. That was unplanned and yet probably the favorite part of our stay. We could also see the pier in the distance. This was a great location for people watching. We didn't leave the sliding doors open at night due to the fact that it was senior week and a little loud, but with the doors closed, we did not hear any noise as we slept. Our room was clean and our housekeeper was Pam who did a wonderful job. We dined at Conner's Beach Cafe on the 2nd floor deck as well as the ground floor restaurant. The food was average and the service was good. Things that were not an issue for us that might be an issue for others include the fact that the pool is rather small and it's on the street side (bay side) of the hotel and not the ocean side. Also, to access the boardwalk, there are stairs from the second floor, although I did see people cutting through the ground floor restaurant.

It is still owned and operated by the Conner family who also developed The Dunes and Dunes Manor. Park Place is a modern facility with a great beach cafe and SailLoft Bar on the second level, on a deck overlooking the beach and boardwalk. We stayed here for two nights and three days the first week of June. Just a brief vacation. Wanted to try a beachfront hotel for a change. Loved our 6th floor room with balcony. Great views of the ocean and boardwalk. Just two plastic chairs on a narrow concrete deck, but there is a privacy wall. We enjoyed watching the gulls soar overhead and swoop down to the boardwalk below. Noise wasn't too bad, even though it was Senior Week. The 6th floor location probably helped. There is a nice HVAC system with a fan for white noise, if you need it. The room itself was huge--long with a bath and kitchen when you first walk in, then two double beds in front of a console with flat screen TV; a sleeper sofa and table and two chairs are nearest the sliding glass door to the balcony. Plenty of room for a family to spread out. Sofa was very comfortable and great for reading with a view of the ocean beyond. The kitchen has a microwave, half-sized refrigerator, and sink. Good beds, slept well. Our room was very clean, and room service did an excellent job the next day tidying up and providing fresh towels. We enjoyed a lunch and breakfast at the Conner Beach Cafe which is located on the second level. It is elevated over the boardwalk and provides a great view of the ocean and people walking by. Loved the palm trees and shaded tables. But, best of all were the local waitresses and bartender who are excellent! Our breakfast of pancakes and French toast was the best; lunch of softshell blue crab sandwiches was yummy, too--good old-fashioned Eastern Shore cooking. Female crabs, but that is another story... On the other side of the steps down to the boardwalk is a deck with rocking chairs overlooking the ocean. Nice! I think this hotel has the best location on the boardwalk. It is just two blocks from N. Division St where all the action is, but located on the widest and most beautiful part of the beach. We set up our chairs on the beach directly in front of the hotel and had no neighbors until 12 noon. Ahhh.... We took the boardwalk tram the full length of the boardwalk, and honestly--Park Place has the best oceanfront rooms of all the boardwalk hotels, and we have stayed at many of them over the years. The beach in Ocean City is very nice-- soft sand with a gentle, long wave to a flat shore line. Perfect for body-surfing; some shells, but no rocks or pebbles. The city has placed wooden play equipment for toddlers periodically along the beach--pirate ships and castles. There are also volleyball nets for the older set. Park Place has the best of OC below it on the boardwalk: Park Place Jewelers, Dough Rollers, Bull On the Beach, Name on Rice... Take a walk and you will see Elvis impersonators, Beatles bands, an OC Cruise-In with vintage automobiles... Who needs Vegas?! Loved it.

Despite management's claim that rooms have been renovated, they are very dated and plain old. Yes, you can see that walls are freshly painted and there are flat screen TV, but that's it. The main problem with this place that there seems to be no thought put into the details: -Towels are so thin, you could practically see through them, - blankets have holes, - drapes have holes and stains. - There are two plastic chairs on the balcony, but no table. So if you want to have a glass of water or a wine with you while watching the waves, you have to hold the glass all the time or put it down on the floor that has birds poop on it. Yes, there is no awning or any kind of cover on the sixth floor balcony so you are at the mercy of the birds flying overhead. - Bayview rooms are a joke. You might see something from the sixth floor but all the other floors get a view of the dumpster and a parking lot. -Oceanview rooms on the second floor get no view at all, just their closed drapes. They are directly on the patio that is occupied by a restaurant and a bar. Unless you want people eating and drinking while watching you in the room, you'll have to keep the drapes closed. Plus even if you opened the drapes, all you see is people eating and drinking. -To get to the boardwalk, you have to get down (or up) two flights of stairs. Entrance is closed at midnight, after that you have to go around this hotel and a neighboring building and through the dark alley to get back. -Only one elevator goes down to the parking level but it does not open its doors most of the times. It comes down to the Ground level and goes back up, that can happen one or more times in a row until it feels like letting you out to the parking. You could get out on the 1st floor and take the stairs, which we did most times but when you have your luggage with you, that's a problem. My husband went down and back up three times before the elevator opened its doors on the Ground level. But the kicker is the front desk's response when I told them about this problem; \"Oh, yeah. It does it sometimes. Do you want to charge the rest of your balance to your MasterCard?\" And that brings me to the REAL BIG problem with this place - complete absence of customer service. -Don't bother asking front desk for the dinning recommendations. They'll whip out a piece of paper with typed up restaurant names and phone numbers and send you to the most touristy ones that have the worst rating on both Tripadvisor and Yelp. -Housekeeping does not nod, smile or say hello when passing guests in the hallway. I think this is the only hotel where stuff does not greet its guests in some way. -If a member of the stuff with a large cart full of dirty things needs to get on the elevator, that's a priority. Never mind that elevator is full of the guests. -The first night we stayed, our room was not cleaned and made. Granted, we left \"DND\" sign on it until 4pm in the afternoon but no one bothered to check in with us if we need it to be cleaned afterwards. Usually, housekeeping would leave you a note asking you to call them when you want your room to be serviced. Not in this place. The second day, room was cleaned, marginally. I left a pair of the sandals by my nightstand and they have not been moved at all. I guess, they just vacuumed around them. You could still see dust in the corners of the room and next to the walls. I could go on but by now you get the idea, The real shame is that this could have been a great place but owners don't seem to have interest in anything except getting your money.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pa", "Title": "\u201c3 day vacation\u201d", "Author": "whimpy", "ReviewID": "UR130748059", "Content": "I can not say one bad thing about this place we were there 3 night second week in may oceanfront room the service was great you couldnt ask for nicer people at the front desk the room was very clean and the price was great too I would stay her again In a heartbeat", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Familyvacationer101", "ReviewID": "UR130185892", "Content": "Stayed on the sixth floor oceanfront room at the Park Place Hotel.

I have returned because of the great boardwalk location and the pleasant owners of the property. This time I was lured in by an email that I had received advertising that the oceanfront 5th and 6th floors had been \"completely renovated\" for this season. Although I already had other trips planned, I decided to book 5 nights because a newly renovated room, OF, for only $81/night is exciting. The positives of this hotel is their location, on property parking, and clean facility. However, we were extremely disappointed with the \"complete renovation.\" The room looked like it was recently painted and a new table and 2 chairs had been resplaced along with flat screen TVs. Other than that, the bedding was old and very poor quality. The mattress was most uncomfortable and old. The bathroom still had the standard straight rod versus the new curved rods. The towels were very poor quality; crisp, not at all soft. And, the carpet was not replaced as I had expected. Definately not a \"complete renovation.\" Because I had only paid $81/nt, I did not complain. However, if I had paid the summer rate of $299, I certainly would have complained! Visiting off season in May gives you an affordable rate. However, half of the shops and restaurants including the pier had not opened yet for the season and the ones that were open, closed up by 6pm. I understand this from the business perspective, however; for the visitor, it is very disappointing. Please understand that the hotel is a good choice. It is clean and the owners are on sight to take care of any issues. In comparison to other properties, I would chose this hotel again. However, for the summer rate of $299...in comparison to that-in August we are staying in Myrtle Beach at Northbeach Plantation for $325/nt for a 2BR condo. It is an incredible property.

It wasn't very clean. There was some sort of liquid that had run down the front and sides of our refrigerator and dried there, and there were many other instances of \"icky\" I detected throughout the room including a large spot on the couch. Being picky on cleanliness, I really can no longer tolerate the patterned, quilt-like \"bedspreads\" that are not washed after every hotel guest, and this place is living in the past by serving up those re-used, re-slept on bedspreads. I know that they are required to wash them once a week by hotel mandated rules, but that's not tolerable for me. I try to only stay in hotels where I have a white bedspread where I can smell that it just came out of the bleached laundry water. The room, however, was spacious and did include a couch which is always a big plus in my book, but the TV was quite small. The lobby was filled with so much stuff it looked messy. Throughout the hotel, you get the feeling that it was furnished and decorated as cheaply as possible. Although it's somewhat tasteful, it's just feels chintzy. For $120.00 for an off season evening in the beginning of April, and for this hotel not serving any type of continental breakfast, having any type of pool, and lacking in other areas, I would say the value here was certainly lackluster. Having read other reviews on Trip Advisor, I would recommend the Holiday Inn or the Hilton. Unfortunately, they were fully booked the night we visited. The location is, however, excellent as it is one of the few hotels right on the boardwalk in Atlantic City.

The Holiday Inn gets 5 stars as it is a nicer, newer hotel (with an awesome pool area!) than Park Place but it is ridiculously expensive, $400+/night during the summer. So, we looked for an alternative and frankly, Park Place worked fine for our needs. We went in June 2011 - this review is a little late. We do not spend a lot of time just sitting in our hotel room. We were out and about on our 3 night weekend, shopping, going on rides, tandem biking, eating lots of junk. There is nothing luxurious about this hotel but you will find that luxury is difficult to come by in OC. So the four star ranking definitely takes that into consideration. The pool is very small but our kids didn't care. My hubby would go down to Conner's, grab us drinks and bring them up to the pool while our kids splashed around. Again, the most important thing about this hotel is its convenience. You really can't ask for much better being so close to all of the action. You could hear a little bit of what is going on outside (room overlooking the boardwalk) but it really wasn't a huge issue most likely because we were exhausted. Not sure I would want to to do more than a few days here with our larger family due to the small size of the rooms but it was good for what we needed for our short visit. Our room had two double beds and a pullout sofa so fits 6 people (and really not much else!). Room had a sink and microwave which is nice although we didn't really have a need for them. If price not a big deal for you and you like a little luxury, try the Holiday Inn on 17th (yes, further from action but still on boarwalk) but if you want some value, better convenience, and are willing to part with some luxury, Park Place gets you bang for your buck.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pottstown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice Off Season Stay\u201d", "Author": "Laura R", "ReviewID": "UR122467883", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay over New Years.

The hot water was shut off there were warning signs posted in front of the elevator doors on each floor of the hotel. Apparently it was going on b/c of a major repair that needed to be done. But we did not notice, it must have been off only briefly since I wasn't greeted by a cold shower (though I was sadly expecting it). The location is the best because you are right on the boardwalk which worked out great for us because I was entering my 3rd trimester, walking and extended time in vehicle was becoming challenging and painful. Park Place never disappoints us, it's family friendly and drama free even during Senior Week (one of the most drama filled times/weeks that Ocean City experiences). As a matter of fact, they banned the rowdy and drunken Senior Week party goers and boardwalk drunkards from using the hotel's facilities mainly the bathroom at night (even put a sign up and locked the doors) many would ask to use the bathroom in the hotel and corner the Conner's staff. They weren't having any of it and didn't even entertain the sarcastic questions like \"so where do you go to the bathroom then?\". Many asked and were turned away. The Conner's Beach Cafe breakfast buffet is the way to go if you're a breakfast person I know I am and you don't want to have to venture too far and no frills.

This really is a great place for both couples and families with children who would enjoy a nice visit. We took the Lewes Ferry across the water and it was most enjoyed and a good purchase as it carred both our vehicle and passengers safety across the water to Ocean City Maryland.

Right on the board walk at 2nd Street with shops and eateries galore and with a direct ocean view and access to OCMD's clean, wide and FREE beaches, with the best OC Beach Patrol life guards. This place just makes your vacation all the better. And did I mention, accommodating??? You won't hear the word \"no\". I am very grateful that after all of these years and all of the growth of OCMD, this hotel has kept itself up, with clean and modern facilities and professional, friendly and caring staff members. When we arrived in our room, it was welcoming and ready with a brand new shower/bath and granite sink and counter. We couldn't get the room safe to work however, so we called the front desk and within 3 minutes, the manager was at our door with the maintence man. It needed a new battery which he installed right there and then, with a smile. O M G, where do you find that kind of service today??? We were able to go straight to the beach and enjoy our vacation with peace of mind. At night, the great views from our balcony were beautiful and relaxing and we all slept like babies.

We stayed here for a week and checked in on a Saturday. The front desk attendant Evelyn was extremely friendly. She noticed our little boy and asked if we'd like to use the pool until our room was ready. She provided us a key to access the pool/restrooms and took our cell phone number so that she could reach us in case our room was ready early. While heading upstairs we heard a call come in over the walkie talkies that the cleaning staff were using letting them know that we had arrived. Our room was ready within the hour which was way before check in time and in time for my son's nap. Kudos to the hotel on this. We asked the front desk to ensure our room was clean by 1pm everyday so that we could get in for my son's nap. We were out of the room by 10am and they were able to accomodate this request which we appreciated. The room was clean and adequate. The pool is small but clean and was large enough for us to splash around in in the afternoons. We had a bay view on the 5th floor which was quite nice. The location on the boardwalk cannot be beat. I think we only drove the car once or twice during our entire trip. The 2nd floor bar area has happy hour everyday with drink specials. The $2 magaritas were a big hit with us!

I was told \u201cwe only have a few months to make money and everyone does it. Besides, the rates say subject to change.\u201d When I asked if they had yet to give the rate listed for any stay this year, I was told \u201cno.\u201d There is a huge difference between \u201csubject to change\u201d and \u201cwe have absolutely no intention of meeting the rates in our rate schedule.\u201d This is a classic \u201cbait and switch.\u201d Also, \u201ceveryone\u201d is not doing this. The hotel bills itself as \u201cgreen.\u201d Our family is greener than most. That said, my recent experience has shown that being green is an excise for some businesses to cut corners to save money. For example, the toilet was adjusted such that about a half gallon was used during the flush. The building code in most areas is 1.3 gallons. The result was that 4 flushes were required to empty the bowl. Rather than call the front desk, I adjusted it myself. Next, there was a red overhead heater connected to a wall timer. No problem so far. However, there didn\u2019t seem to be any fan or air movement when the switch was turned on. When I called the front desk to inquire, I was told \u201cit\u2019s a quiet fan.\u201d Doubting this, I took the fixture apart and discovered the reason it was quiet \u2013 there was no fan. There was a small vent in the ceiling but I couldn\u2019t detect any air moving through it either. Without getting graphic, there is a very good reason why bathrooms typically have exhaust fans. Were these issues maintenance problems not intended by the owners? Doubtful. The result of the lack of humidity removal \u2013 green mold on the back of the sink. The shower also had peeling paint. I have never been on a smaller hotel balcony. It was about 2 feet in depth and too small for someone of average size to sit comfortably in a chair and face the ocean. While the room bathroom and shower were reasonably clean for a beach hotel the public men\u2019s room on the 1st floor was not. It had wall paper peeling from the wall. They could do much better. As others have mentioned, a beach goer has to go through the hotel and either up the very slow elevator, or up stairs to get to a location to wash sand off. An outdoor location, like some other hotels, would help keep common areas clean. Mike, the staff member who checked us in was unnecessarily brusque. When I asked, as I always do to get the best available room, \u201cwhat rooms are available,?\u201d I was told \u201cnone.\u201d Since we got there early and hung out until a room was open, this is highly unlikely. They just didn\u2019t want to accommodate us. This is the first time I\u2019ve every encountered this. If they were sold out, they should have said.

There is a coffee maker, microwave, small refrigerator, dish rack, and a few plates, bowls, cups and some silverware. They provide dish soap. I brought my own electric burner to cook on. There's PLENTY to eat on the Boardwalk though. No shortage of good food. The bathtub is great. It has jets that my kids LOVED!!! They spent lots of time in the bath. The rooms are supposedly \"smoke-free,\" but ours smelled like old smoke. You are not supposed to smoke on the balcony either, but our neighbors did. Not all the rooms smell that way though. It's not the hotel's fault, just the ignorant guest. There is a pull-out couch that is great for the kids (or short adults). Stay on the bayside for a quieter stay. The pool: The pool is shaded for most of the morning. I have fair skin, so I liked that. Not a very big pool though. Other amenities: They have one washer and one dryer. They cost a $1 each. Not many people used it either. There's a game room, but I never went to it. There is free internet, but it can be VERY slow during busy hours. Our computer kept dropping the connection.

My room was big enough for a couple, or with up to two small children; if you have teenagers it might be a little tight. Yes the elevator is slow and the pool is small, but we were on the 3rd floor and took the stairs most of the time and I don't use a pool that much anyway. The mini fridge and microwave were very handy. The whole hotel is kept very clean. Good channels on the TV. Several restaurants within a short walk. Park Place is very quiet, except for when the gulls start in at 5 a.m. or if they are power spraying the benches. The balcony is narrow, about 3 1/2 feet, but is completely private, you won't be forced to talk to your neighbors. That was also important to me.

I picked this hotel based on its location and that it was ranked so high here. While the hotel is fine, I honestly cannot understand at all how it can be ranked so high here.

They have a nice deck facing the water that serves food and drinks, but it's not covered so it's only good when the weather is nice. It rained all day our first day, so I came to appreciate how imporant these things can be! The hotel staff is friendly but not very knowledgeable when it comes to the area. I asked questions about different places, and they just didn't seem to know the answers. The hotel rooms are fine but the bathrooms are kind of small, and the tub seemed particularly small! The best thing about the hotel is its location (right near the action), and the drinks on the deck were great! I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families because there were so many people getting drunk on the deck and outside the hotel at night!! Last year we stayed a week at the Holiday Inn Suites Hotel further up the boardwalk. That hotel is more expensive and not as close to the action but it was wonderful! It has a great outside pool facing the ocean (and you can get food and drinks by the pool) and the rooms are very large!! (and they have much nicer balconies).

The complimentary soaps were Bath & Bodyworks. The view was incredible... got some great sunrise photos! The sofabed was not comfortable to sit on, the cushions were at an angle backward. Just on that I would guess the bed isn't very comfortable when pulled out. My biggest complaint was the bed... just wasn't comfortable and didn't sleep well. However, the staff was very friendly and helpful! We needed to print out our boarding passes for our flight the next day. They have a complimentary computer in the lobby, but no printer. But the manager printed out our passes and was happy to do so. The jewelry store attached that faces the Boarkdwalk has some nice pieces, plus you get an extra 10% discount if you stay at the hotel. The hotel was clean, which is a definite plus! In the off season some places can look very run down and dingy, not Park Place. Since we didn't need to leave OC for BWI until 1:00 and it was off season, late check out was no problem. Although when we went back to the room after 11, our key card wouldn't let us in, so we had to go back down to the front desk, just a minor glitch.

I don't care how much cheaper it is...it is not worth any amount of $$ to subject my family to mold, mildew, bacteria, germs, etc...and that is what you get when you stay in a hotel that doesn't care about clean. Our room was always fresh, the halls, the elevator, and pool were always clean. What impressed me was how often I saw someone vaccuming the halls. It must be a CHALLENGE to manage all the sand, water, moisture, etc, when you are located right on the beach!! We visited other hotels along the shore (Comfort Inn and Days INN) and they do NOT do a good job managing this. They stink! Park Place must have a better ventillation system or something to keep the moisture factor down. The other hotels carpet in the elevators and hall smelled mildewy and we saw black mold on the ceilings - Gross! So, if you are looking for clean and fresh, Park Place is it. Also, OUTSTANDING location! Noise was not a factor at all. We had friends staying down around 17th-21st who told us 2nd-3rd street was too close to all the noise of the boardwalk and that we would hate it...WRONG! Not a problem at all.

My husband is a hard person to please, and right away he loved the room. It had a small kitchenette area with micro,coffee maker, dishes,utensils, mini refridge,etc. Also a sofa and a small 2 seat dining table. The balcony was the highlight of the room. Spacious and private. Great view to the ocean and boardwalk. There were 2 chairs outside in the balcony area. The room was clean and every morning we went out, the room got done right away. The hotel is in a perfect location. Its right on 2nd St. In the middle of all kinds of shops,bars,and restaurants. I'm really glad we stayed in that area. The hotel also had a small pool, which I only used once and it was nice and refreshing. Lots of lounge chairs around. The parking lot was huge and was able to find a good spot. If you forget your laptop, they have a complimentary computer for the guests, right by the front desk. My husband and I found our favorite hang out spot....It was on the 2nd floor of the hotel, Conner's Sail Loft Bar....It was a cool bar with a tropical feel to it. The bar overlooked the boardwalk/beach and it was great enjoying a nice cold drink and looking at the ocean. We went there quite a bit for drinks and happy hour. Happy hour had some great specials....$3 Coronas and $2 margaritas(delicious by the way and I'm not a big margarita drinker). The prices of the drinks were reasonable too. The food was delicious too. My all time favorite was the Imperial crab bisque soup.....You must try it....Its excellent! Had some sandwiches,burgers,and wraps too. The staff there included Kevin, Anthony,Chad,and Billy, to name a few, who went above and beyond to make our stay as pleasurable as it could be.

Not only were the rooms kept impeccably clean, but workers were constantly sweeping, mopping and wiping down everything in the common areas (lobby, poolside, and deck/bar areas) every day. The family that owns this hotel has been operating on this site for over 100 years, and they have their act down! We had a slight problem with our internet connection that was quickly fixed. Otherwise, we had no problems at all. We booked at the last minute and had to settle for a 2nd floor oceanfront room, which does not have a private balcony, but rather opens up to the common deck area adjacent to the bar. We were not crazy about the lack of privacy, but it turned out OK - easy access to the beach and lobby without the need for the elevator, and it was nice to just walk out of our room and get a drink just steps away. If we stay there again, however, we'll try for an upper floor so we can have some privacy and keep the screen door open at night. We ate at the downstairs restaurant (Connor's) one night, and I do not recommend the food there - our quesadillas were served burnt, and the whole dinner (crab cakes, fries, etc) tasted and smelled of rancid oil.

I really have trouble with shore hotels that are not clean, but this one was OK. There was a little bit of mold in the bathroom and the choice of black grout on the floor tiles is sort of odd, but the toilet, tub and linens were all clean. The housekeepers are very sweet - all students from Russia and they can't do enough for the guests. Our room was supposed to overlook the bay (we booked at the last minute and nothing was available on the ocean side) and it was a pretty poor view. You are really overlooking a couple of commercial garbage bins, other hotels, the pool and the parking lot. When you sit out on the very small balcony it was really, really noisy. The air conditioner units for all the hotels are just amazingly loud. But we bought coffee in the morning and went to the public deck on the other side of the hotel overlooking the boardwalk which was very nice. A pleasant surprise was how quiet the room was. We could not hear any outside or interior noise. Great soundproofing! The pool looked nice but is very small - really great for small kids - our teenagers were not interested. The deepest part is 4 feet. One thing that was really odd was the small room on the left on the 2nd floor as guests walk into the hotel from the boardwalk. It contained some restaurant stuff, computers, slushy machines, mops and cleaning supplies and was really filthy. The floor, the counters, the odor - everything was a real turn off. Needless to say, we never ate in the restaurant at the hotel. We didn't have any trouble getting on site parking, which was helpful. And there are plenty of places to grab meals right near the hotel. The hotel is near the southern end of the boardwalk, really close to the amusement parks, arcades, Ripley's, etc. It is busy and noisy, so if you don't like that kind of stuff you need to go further north. The beach was right across the boardwalk, several steps from the hotel. We can recommend Kohr's and Dumsers on the boardwalk for ice cream, Sneaky Pete's on the bay for crabs and seafood, Piezano's for pizza, Anthony's for an awesome roast beef sandwich (they are huge) and the Fractured Prune for the oddest donuts you will ever eat. We also liked the Thriller boat ride, took a side trip to Assateague to see the ponies which was really terrific, and went to Berlin which was an interesting break on a cloudy afternoon (if you go, make sure you wander into JJ Fish Gallery and the General Store.)

Over the years, we have stayed in many different hotels in Ocean City, but return to few. As has been our experience in the past, Park Place Hotel is both well run and maintained, being family owned and operated (see the pictures in the lobby - and if you've read anything about the history of Ocean City, you'll recognize the Connor name). For doubters like BALT04, I assure you that my review is not written by a member of the hotel, but a customer who has returned due to having a good experience at this hotel. The rooms are not luxurious, but you're not at an All Inclusive in Mexico - you're in Ocean City, MD and you're paying a very moderate rate for a fantastic location at a clean and well managed hotel. The Park Place Hotel is probably one of the best deals in OC. The rooms are of a decent size and somewhat basic, but comfortable, and include a sofa. As a returning customer, I can tell you that with every return, we notice improvements to the property. Since our last stay (it's been 2 years since we couldn't get in during the time we wished to stay last year), they've tiled the entrance in the room and they added a washer and dryer for the customers near the pool. The staff is pleasant and professional, which is a welcome departure from what we encountered at similarly priced hotels in OC. We always arrive extremely early and register, and the front desk staff takes our cell phone number and calls us when our room is early, which is really helpful. This spares you from feeling a nuisance by checking back. We've never encountered any housekeeping or maintenance problems at Park Place Hotel. We've never seen any mold, had any leaks or malfunctioning appliances or plumbing. In short, while there may be more luxurious or larger rooms to be had in Ocean City, many are exorbitantly priced and people who stay there may be disappointed at what they get for their money ... if you pay a lot, you expect a lot. I believe the great ratings and reviews earned by Park Place is representative of the reasonable rates charged for a property that is clean, decent and owner operated ... all of which compares favorably to other properties .... even the glitzy new spots. If you want lavish, be prepared to pay for it elsewhere.

I went down to the front desk to inform them, and quietly asked for it to be removed. House keeping was sent to our room in a timely manner, but they cleaned our room and NEVER REMOVED THE CONDOM!!! We had to eventually do it ourselves. Later that day we we went out on the balcony, we noticed there were FOUR MORE CONDOMS right in our view on top of the parked cars. I called down to the front desk and asked to have them removed. By this time I was getting tired of trying to explain what these were to my kids. 20 - 30 minutes later, they were still there so I went down to the front desk and once again asked to have them removed. My request was greeted with irritation! It's not like I was asking for extra towels, I was asking to have condoms removed. I would have thought the situation would have been given immediate attention. Later that evening my youngest son and I decided to sit out on the balcony. What a view we had. A gang of kids SMOKING POT and URINATING in the parking lot of the hotel. Who would have thought that it could get worse after the condom incident!!! Spit on the floor of the elevator. Sock still in tree in hall. Day 3: Another day....ANOTHER CONDOM on our balcony. House keeping did come to our room immediately, but along with the condom, they also removed an item belonging to my son! Ice cream splattered all over the floor of the elevator. Sock still in tree in hall.

When I talked with the owner of the hotel on day three of our stay, her only response was \"sorry\" or \"it's not our responsibility\". Never once did she even ask what had been removed from our balcony that belonged to my son. I had put down in writing all the things that we had experienced during our stay. I had hoped that after she ended our discussion that she might sit down and read what I had written...I thought she might realize that she never addressed that one of her house keeping staff had taken something belonging to us. That never happened. I truly feel that she didn't care at all....she had us stuck in her hotel knowing that there were no rooms available at other hotels because of the busy week it was. The most disheartening thing was the sadness of my youngest son. He kept asking if would could go through the trash to find what house keeping had taken. He also kept asking if could call the police.

Unfortunately this was the last of the pleasant surprises! The bed sheets on both beds had yellow stains on them and the blankets had holes in them! The desk manager apologized and said they would improve the training of their housekeepers to make sure this would not happen again. In my opinion the apology was not good enough! When you are spending over $200 a night you expect that the room was inspected and everything is clean and ready for your arrival. The balcony had railings with peeling paint and what appeared to be mold stains on the concrete. The two resin chairs were dirty! The elevator was pretty slow as some reviewers had stated but when we were in a hurry we used the stairs. I think management should use the stairwell once in a while! It's dirty and the doors to the stairwell should have windows. My son said it reminded him of getting on the subway in New York! The pool is small but my son enjoyed it! If this hotel is #2, I could only imagine what the other hotels are like!! We would not stay here again! To end on a positive note I'd like to recommend the Captains Galley 2 restaurant it was a bit pricey but you get what you pay for!!

The house keeping is ok. We have a light bulb problem and they fixed up right away. However, our second day they forget to bring us a kitchen wash cloth and the third day they forget to bring us any sugar/creamer/stirer package. These are minor issues I can live with it. The mattress and sofa bed are ok we have no problem with it. There is also a small balcony that has two chairs that you can seat down. Overall the room is ok. I will say it is like a typical 3 star hotel room. The location is at the prime in the broadwalk. It is also very easy access to the beach. I like the beach - very clean and usually it is not that crowded. The pool is on the second floor. It is a small rectangular size pool. My boys went there quite often. All the times we went there were not crowded so it is ok for us. I wish they had a whirpool for adult to enjoy. There is no gym in the hotel. As for parking they have plenty of space. I don't have any problem finding parking spots. I noticed there is a guy standing outside the entrance on Sat just to check who is coming in. Many people says the elevator is slow. It is slow but we are on vacation not on a rush so this is not a big deal for us. This is my first time to OC.

We arrived in the afternoon and were promptly checked in by a friendly staff member. The Room We had an Oceanview Room on the top floor (the 6th) and the view was fantastic. The room was a tad on the small side but it's comparable to, if not bigger than, other hotels in OC in the same price range. The room was very clean and the cleaning staff was timely and thorough. The bathroom is a bit small, but the B&BW products were a nice touch. We went during Senior Week and were concerned about noise from the boardwalk at night, but with the door closed, we didn't hear a thing. Overall, I'd say the room was average but nothing to write home about. Note: every light fixture in the room uses an energy saving bulb. For those who aren't accustomed to them, that means the room will appear very dark when you first turn the lights on, but within a minute or so the bulbs will become brighter. The Elevators Much has been made in the reviews about the elevators being slow and I'd have to agree. Since we were on vacation, however, it wasn't that big of a deal to us, but we overheard quite a few guests complain about how slow the elevators were. We typically used the stairs to go down to the lobby or the boardwalk. The Pool We wanted to take a dip in the pool at one point, but it was closed as they were working on it for the rest of the day. Not sure how often this occurs, but when the ocean is right there, it's not that big of a deal. Overall We thought the Park Place Hotel was great and we got exactly what was advertised. They offer incredibly fair prices considering their location, and as they say, the most important things in real estate are location, location, location. Bull on the beach, Love's Lemonade (& funnel cake), Fishers Popcorn, Dippin Dots, etc... are all a short walk away.

I trusted the reviews on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. When we arrived, we were too early to check in, but the front desk offered to take our cell number so they could call us once our room was ready, and gave us a parking pass so we could leave our car in the parking lot and wander the boardwalk. We didn't book anything special, just a bay view, two double beds room, but the room looked like it had been freshly painted, and was very clean. Everything looked almost brand new. There were even dishes in the little cabinets above the sink to my surprize. We only paid about $100 for this room and got so much for that, which was a relief. I hate paying unreasonable amounts for poor rooms with no or few amenities. Our room was on the sixth floor, which is the top floor, and though yes, we faced the parking lot and other buildings and not the ocean, we could see the bay and it was still a nice view. There were two chairs on our balcony and it wasn't so bad to sit out there. But I also believe why pay extra for an ocean view when you can just walk out to the beach two seconds a way? The hotel also has an area a floor above the boardwalk, which faces the boardwalk, with rocking chairs lined up along the rail so you can sit and have a relaxing view of the ocean anyways. A couple reviews I read before we went had mentioned uncomfortable beds and pillows but we actually found the beds and pillows in our room to be really, really comfortable. I did read another post by management that said they were replacing bedding so I think they may have done that in preparation for this coming summer season. This hotel is prime location, another perk. I would highly recommend staying here if you can. If you're a stickler for a clean room, you'll get it here. At least, we had a great experience.

The location was perfect and is close to everything.

Only down fall is the very slow elevator, the hot hallways and the security deposit they make you put down (per person). I understand it is to cover them but can't they keep your credit card on file for that!?! One more thing, the traffic going towards the inlet can be heavy. In the evenings it can take forever.

For the price ($225 for non Ocean View in the middle of summer), the place is a SCREAMING value for Ocean City. This is easily one of the top 5 hotels in Ocean City, but that is sadly because the OC Hotel scene is filled with rotting 30+ year old hotels the Harrison Group won't spend money on. Park Place is not dirty or run down, but it is very...below average compared to any other non Ocean City Hotel. We normally stay at the Holiday in on 17th street, but they wanted $400 a night, and seeing all the good reviews, I thought we would try park place. Pros- Good location Cheap Kept up better than 95% of the hotels in OC. Things to keep in mind- The Hotel as a whole is VERY small. Lobby is the smalledt I have ever seen. Rooms are smaller than most other hotels Ihave been at. The two double beds were very small, and the kitchenette was a joke. The hotel, though new, gives the impression it was built on a tight budget. The rooms seem to have many more year on them than the hotel is old...but they were clean. The hotel has an issue with temperatures. The hallways were almost muggy, and the rooms we cold...except the bathroom, which was like the Tahiti desert for some reason. There is no indoor pool, and the wireless internet never really worked for me. There are only two elevators, and they were creaky and slow. The elevator creaked and lurched to the point it seemed unsafe, and once even moved after the doors had opened, and I was in the middle of getting off. Even odder, this is the first building I have been in, where instead of having the elevator safety permit posted in the the elevator...they have a sign that says anyone who wants to see the permit should ask the front desk? Seems a bit odd to me? Anyway...there is another reason I will never stay at Park Place again. Me and my wife were supposed to check out on Tuesday, but instead had to check out on Sunday at 1pm due to unexpected circumstances. Now I fully understand not getting the cost of Sunday night back, but the manager insisted on charging use for Monday also even though we would be long gone. When you check in they give you a list of stuff to initial, and one is that you \"understand there will be no refunds for leaving early\". When this was explained, I basically understood I didn't have a leg to stand on...but after the woman billed me for two nights I would not be there...the other cashier asked her if our \"room #\" was clean, because they were sold out, and trying to get someone in it. For some reason, this just made me angry to the point I would never stay there again. In closing, if you are going to OC and feel that a hotel experiance is an important part of you vaction, spend the money on the Hilton or Holiday inn...there really is nothing else in OC that is worth the money...especially with how much bigger and cheaper Myrtle Beach is.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia Area, PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "kklldd", "ReviewID": "UR5471757", "Content": "This hotel was very clean.

The beach has nice wooden walkways that get you halfway down the sand before we had to start pulling the wagon down the sand. The hotel is right on the boardwalk and close to wonderful restaurants.

The food leaves room for improvement, but there are tons of restaurants on the boardwalk. Flavors of Italy has AWESOME food. The hotel offers food vouchers for purchase. I don't recommend them though. Breakfast isn't great at the hotel, and the $60 voucher that we purchased bought us a HORRIBLE meal at Adolfo's. The food was very expensive, and the meat was low quality with tons of fat and gristle. I can't rate the other restaurants on the certificate, but I would never buy another voucher from this hotel. Be prepared as well to pay for everything from local phone calls to VCRs and DVD players. The pool is very small, but clean and well maintained.

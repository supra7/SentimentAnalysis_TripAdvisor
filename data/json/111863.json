While the hotel facilities (bed, cleanliness, good sound proofing, complimentary parking, microwave) are good, we had some discomfort as hotel guests. The room was not made after the first night with neither any explanation, nor apology. I had to call Housekeeping, twice, to get fresh towels. On the day we checked out, the phone rang at 8:30 AM - we did not ask for morning call. When we ignored this, there was a knock on the door a minute later from a female housekeeping staff. There was another knock on the door at 9:40 AM from another male housekeeping staff. The check-out time is noon. It just shows how poor this hotel is run, as there is no coordination among departments.

We were a bit dubious after seeing the rate of $40 per night, but we had positive experiences staying there when it was still the Radisson so we decided to give it a shot. When we arrived, the front desk clerk informed us that they didn't have a room with 2 double beds available and they could only offer us a room with a queen or a king. Irritated, we pulled out the confirmation we had printed when we booked it that said we had a confirmed reservation. The sassy clerk (who didn't even have a name tag on so we could report her to the manager) told us that she couldn't do anything except stand there and keep telling us that she couldn't give us the room we wanted. She didn't even seem remotely interested in trying to find an alternate solution for us and told us to call the manager, who conveniently wasn't there. Needless to say we will never be staying here again, regardless of how convenient it is.

My brother and I stayed at this hotel mainly due to the location. The hotel was difficult to find due to the Airport being under construction. We circled the terminal a good 2-3 times before finally getting into the parking lot of the hotel. You could see the hotel, just couldn't get in. The check in process took a long time (30 minutes +) considering I had the confimation numbers. They couldn't find my reservation, even though I had made it online (through Regency) days before. When we got to the room I immediately noticed that the door to the room had been kicked in at one point. The deadbolt wouldn't lock and the swing lock was completely missing. The peephole had also been filled with kleenex since that was also missing. There were sleep number beds in the room, both of which were broken. The bathroom door had also been kicked in and wouldn't latch closed. There was mold on the walls and in the hallways around the elevator. We also had no hot water for showers in the morning. Most disturbing was the presence of what appeared to be prostitutes in the lobby (12:30am). I'm 9 months pregnant, had I not been staying here with my brother I would have left and found a different hotel. Something else worth mentioning. The Memphis airport is the main hub for FedEx flights, which leave between 10pm and 5am.

At the check-in counter the hotel informed us as well as the a.m. other guests that they were overbooked and therefore could not give us rooms. Apparently, the hotel had not received the third party reservations for that date. We could understand it if it were one single provider as transmission problems can occur, but all parties booked thru different providers like Orbitz, hotels. com, priceline etc. Our conclusion is that the hotel gave away the rooms to walk-ins at the double rate due to the Festival and rejected all 'low-revenue bookings'. In addition, hotel staff was extremely arrogant. We arrived in the evening, exhausted and looking forward to a good night sleep, traveling with a toddler and a senior citizen. We were left on our own; the hotel provided no support in finding an alternative. All hotels were fully booked that weekend and we had to drive one hour to Jackson, where we were lucky to get the 2 last rooms in a room, arriving at 2 a.m.. It's good we had a car. There were other 'stranded' tourists without a car who spent US$ 30 for a cab just to get to the airport hotel as there was allegedly no shuttle bus to this 'airport' hotel.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Timonium, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPoor Management and service\u201d", "Author": "HPSHETYE", "ReviewID": "UR106750371", "Content": "The front desk is so slow that it took over 2 hrs of wait in the line after a Delta flt was delayed.

I understand that it is an airport hotel, but it is located next to the runway.

At about three in the morning the planes start taking off. This lasted until I had to get up at 4:20 AM. It starts by kind of sounding like someone is using a vacuum in the room next to you, and then ends with a big roar, and your bed shaking.

I could look out the window and actually see the flight crews on FedEx aircraft as they taxied past and turned to take off what seemed like less than 1000 feet from my room!

Good security, safe. Quiet and friendly. CONS: A little pricy, bath houses do need daily attention. NEW: Camp site cement pads are a welcomed new addition to the sites.

A call to the office soon corrected that. There were no bugs in our cabin, or even out on the deck. Cooking meals there saved us money, although every chain restaurant in the USA seems to have a spot on the main drag. The pool was small, but wasn't overcrowded when we were there. The pond has at least one alligator in it, and some people mentioned that there was a second gator, but I didn't see 2.

It was horrible but it certainly was not all that great. Upon pulling in everything looks really nice. I just found myself to be disappointed at the conditions of the bath houses. Just in general not very convenient for taking a shower and getting ready/dressed. How about some hooks or somewhere to set your belongings down? The bath house clearly had not been cleaned in some time. We stay at a lot of campgrounds and know that they generally get pretty messy quickly but there was just dirt everywhere. I saw the same dirt and crime and streaks all week. The soap dispensers and paper towels were constantly empty and the trash cans were always overflowing. Not impressed. The pool is the real joke. It is crowded and loudand very small. There are so many people in the pool that I was grossed out. So grossed out that I did not go in once. People were everywhere. Just not an enjoyable pool experience for us! It's too bad because the pool building and cafe are in nice shape just too many people in one small pool. The cafe at the pool is decent and food and beverage prices are reasonable which is nice. I couldn't pack up fast enough here. Overpriced and crowded. I also didn't the area.

We were moved into a brand new cottage that had never been occupied and the air did not work and was moved yet again to another cottage.

The worst was the loud noise coming from the refridgerator that sounded like a \"weedeater\". I was very disappointed as we had purchased season tickets for Disney and planned to return in the summer for vacation and planned to book our vacation before we left.

I was told the house was being cleaned from the prior guests this was not the case. I washed it and made our dinner. I called the office to inform them that we found crackers on the table and floor, Bedroom drawers were broke and unable to be used, I told Stacy not to worry about that but the door from our bedroom was jacked up. I cleaned kitchen, floors and counter. We went swimming and came back, put TV on to find we really had bad reception, we went to bed. Big days ahead with 7 days of park passes. Up early, made breakfast, cleaned up and left for park. Came back at midnight, put kids to bed, tried to hook up to internet there was none available, called front desk, no help! Went to bed. Got up 12-29-10, went to park, got home after midnight, put kids to bed. My daughter woke me up 1:30 AM, found a cockroach in her bedroom (we have in a zip lock bag). We looked for hotels (15 mile search) nearby and all were full. We then looked around and found no more bugs alive, only dead ones on kitchen cabinets. I told her it was probably a fluke & go back to bed, now 4AM. Got up early and back to park 12-30, back after midnight, put kids to bed and turned on bathroom light and found a fast moving cockroach from sink to under toilet! We are now done, Had to wake up kids, pack our clothes and food at 1:30 called front desk to inform of the concerns and was told \"okay\" by desk clerk. I let a lot of things go such as the slanted steps, dirty glass door trim, melted lamp shade, Receptacle falling out of the wall, broken pocket door, bad reception on TV, no internet, Mold on bathroom sink and on plastic in fold out sofa, two holes in wall in bedroom, and two many cockroaches too stay.no sleep for two nights made our New Years a bust.

The first was in April of this year. For the April trip I travel with extended family and we booked three cottages. One at each level. This was a research trip to check out the resort for a possible family reunion site.We didn't let the staff know what we were up to and booked this via the resort web site. On the April trip I stayed in a premium 2 bedroom cottage. On the trip in October I stayed in a platinum 2 bedroom cottage. Both were clean and well maintained. They both had full kitchens. This save us a ton of cash on meals out. The location is wonderful only a few min. drive to Disney. The pool area, pool bar and snack bar were great and resonably priced. Pool side games were offerd why we were there in April over my kids spring break. We stayed mid week in Oct. and found the pool was much quieter.The resort also offers a coin opperated laundry room, when I used this, I found it both clean and affordable. We had no isuues what so ever on either trip. On the last day of the April visit we asked for a tour of the property and details for booking group stays. Leigh showed us around and explain in detail about group bookings. We did end up booking our family reunion forJuly of 2011. I have not one regret over this choice. Our group contract clearly states that group discounts are only offered if we book 10 or more cabins! It's very clear that you are staying in a cabin not a hotel room. There is no maid service during your stay and although the resort gives you a starter pack of things like dish soap and toilet paper you need to provide these for yourself. This was made clear. It's a trade off one makes for more space over a typical hotel room. Also, prices for the Veranda rental are determined by the amount of cabins we book. I have found the staff to be a joy to work with. On our recent trip this past week once again I booked online. Our cabin was spotless! Gounds are beautiful! Never had a bug issue. We had a wonderful break from real world life. I would not hesitate to book here again. My only word of advice would be to make sure you book a premium or platinum cottage as the older standard cottages are well worn and not worth staying in in my opinion. This is a great family friendly resort. My kids are 7,10 and 12. Everyone in my family enjoyed our stays here.

Check-out was smooth even though the front desk guy tried to bark at me about my not having paid the pet fee. When I pointed out that the confirmation I had been given at check-in was not my confirmation and I had no way to confrm my paying the pet fee, he calmed down considerably. He had one of the staff check our unit for pet damage and within 5 minutes, we were done. A/C worked wonderfully as it was in the 80's with humidity the whole time we were there. The exterior chairs and table could have used a good scrubbing but we did not use due to heat and showers. There were many campers but we hardly saw anyone - may be due to the heat. Only bug problem we had was a lizard gaining entrance while we were entering - I helped him exit via broomstick. We did have to park about 3 car lengths from our unit (a whole lot closer than any hotel room I've stayed in) and no one was using the other 3 units that we shared the courtyard with or this may have been a different review. Will use the Tropical Palms in the future when traveling with our pets. Good value, close to Disney and close to many dining options.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tropical Palms Resort and Campground", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d88092-Reviews-Tropical_Palms_Resort_and_Campground-Kissimmee_Florida.html", "Price": "$57 - $101*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2650 Holiday Trail</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Kissimmee</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34746</span></span> (Formerly Tropical Palms FunResort)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "88092", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d8/33/d8332555cd0af0415e170284b89ed3ca5large.jpg"}}

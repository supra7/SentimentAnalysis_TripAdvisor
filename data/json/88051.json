Overall, the hotel - it's a real stretch to call it a \"resort\" - is an affordable Disney-area option for those wanting a placing to sleep. The rooms aren't super clean and hot water in bathroom was intermittent. The outdoor pool was clean. Not much else in the way of amenities; and certainly none to justify the resort fee which is added to the room rate. One real annoyance is the inability to check in even a minute before the 3 pm hour. The front desk was understaffed, somewhat unhelpful, and not capable of handling the lineup of people waiting for 3 pm. For about $70 a night it might be worth it, provided that you don't have high expectations.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "bess24", "ReviewID": "UR128190431", "Content": "Stayed here for three weeks from the 24th March to the 14th April from reading the reviews before i left i was very anxious as staying for so long however when i arrived it was better than worst fears, by no means is this hotel anything special but it is a good priced hotel close to disney. During our stay there was only one day with no towels and maid left a note to appologise so we rang through for some when we got back and it wasn;t an issue. there was also an ongoing issue with our safe which was a little irrating three different days it errored and we needed both maintance and security to come to room to sort which each time took 30min or so.

I was slightly nervous after reading the negative reviews, but didn't need to be. We found the room to be fine for our needs. It was slightly dated maybe, but certainly not a problem for us. It was kept clean every day and had enough room for the 4 of us. We only really used it as a base, as we were out at the parks all day, and for this purpose it was absolutely fine. The only negative about the rooms was that on several occasions the towels, cups and coffee were not replenished, but a quick call to reception and they were delivered immediately. Was slightly annoying, but certainly not a major big deal. We used the pool area twice and that was lovely. Nice to be able to relax and have a swim after a long day at the parks. We had breakfast a couple of times, and although slightly more expensive than the surrounding restaurants, was really nice. They even do a breakfast to go, where you can fill plastic trays which are then weighed and charged at $5.50 per lb in weight. We used this service several times if we were leaving early to get to the parks early. This was a great help in getting us to the parks before they opened to avoid the long lines. I can't comment on the shuttle service as we never used them. We never found any problems with the staff being rude, in fact they were always very helpful and polite. The resort fee was explained to us at the time of booking, so no surprises there for us. All in all we really enjoyed our stay. We found this hotel to be great value for money, in an excellent location for all the parks and loads of nice restaurants and we would definately stay there again.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "whycocomagh", "Title": "\u201cmedication stolen from room\u201d", "Author": "dale f", "ReviewID": "UR128076942", "Content": "First of all they will not let you check in even 5 minutes early so if you have an early flight coming in you should find something to do.

Rooms were outdated and not real clean, the shower heads had some kind of mould or something on them and behind the desk had some kind of stain on the wall. There was only wireless internet in certain parts of the hotel and when we called to the front desk they insisted there was a modem in our room which we could not find and when we finally got someone to check after telling them 3 times there was no modem someone finally came and gave us one and unless your use to dial-up internet it was not worth so if your there on bussiness make sure you get a room with wireless because you will not be able to do anything. All this i could deal with but when most of my wifes medication went missing that is when i had to write this review. we called the front desk and they called the police but when all was said and done my wife ended up missing out on 2 days of our family time at disney and pretty much ruined her vacation and the hotel refused to make it right and told us the maid said there was beer in our room everyday and basically made it sound like we were a bunch of drunken party animals which we are not .Well first of all my wife does not drink and can you imagine anyone having a beer on there vacation after a long day at disney (a little sarcasm). so overall our experience was terrible.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cSeemed OK - But no one was going to go out of their way.\u201d", "Author": "Jason S", "ReviewID": "UR127949496", "Content": "Reading some of the reviews I was concerned.

I was a bit put off by some of the negative reviews but we really didn't encounter any of the problems other people had. Our room was cleaned every day and towels were replenished, I even asked one of the housekeeping ladies for extra towels to put in my room (based on reviews I read) but didn't really need them, however, the towels are very small...I brought some from home as well based on reviews. Bugs, you're in Florida people, there are going to be bugs, the lovebugs don't bother anyone but there are red fire ants, I did not encounter any bed bugs, I brought one of those Off Clip on discs and had it on all day at pool and turned on every night before bed (again, based on other reviews) and had absolutely no issues. I was not fond of the pillows but that is because I prefer firm ones. Yes, they don't use full sheets on the bed, but all other sheets were neatly tucked and it presented no problems. No, it isn't the Hilton, but for the price you pay did anyone really expect that. Yes, hotel could use some maintenance but I called ahead and requested renovated room and they happily granted me that. Miniature golf course isn't very great but it's free along with the use of basketball and court which my son thoroughly enjoyed, along with the arcade room. General store inside also sold snacks, beer, wine, and cigarettes. Pool by building 1-3 is heated at night and open till 11pm, unlike the pool by the other building, there is no lifeguard though, and I was in the pool till 1am at times. Great thing about that pool is that every night at 8pm they show a movie for the kids, my son, and all the kids (as well as myself) loved this. Breakfast buffet was not the best, but definitely edible and doable at $8.50 and kids eat free, the rest of the food there was good though, and reasonably priced. There is a pizza hut on premise, and they also serve food from the restaurant there which is also available at the tiki bar by the pool (by building 1). There are places to eat right on the street when you walk out like Cici's, Fridays, Red Lobster, Dennys, Crackerbarrel, etc, as well as a Winn Dixie across the street (to buy snacks for your fridge) and a 24 Wallgreens literally in the parking lot of hotel. Only thing I didn't like was that the shuttles to attractions only leave to go to certain places at certain times and the same with returns, BUT that was nothing cause if you plan your day you can make it so that you can come back later if you want from another pickup location since all the Disney Busses are free and you could just take a bus from there to catch the hotel shuttle at a different park and return time. Other than that, this was a very family friendly hotel with lots to keep the kids busy AND happy and feasible options for transportation to your theme parks. My son loved this place, we hung out there for 3 full days he had so much fun and said he didn't wanna leave anywhere. If you just want somewhere to hang with the kids and a clean, comfortable room to sleep in after long days at the parks then look no further, great value for the price. All the staff was friendly and helpful. I am a single mom so finding places my son enjoys, that are safe and comfortable for him are my top priority, and this did it.

And at the end of the day, all we were using the room for was to sleep in at the end of a tiring day so I'll actual time in the room was spent in a state of sleep for 95% of the time. The breakfasts were quite enjoyable, they had a chef that cooked omelettes to order which was nice but then breakfasts weren't included in our holiday price so we didn't commit to eating there each morning. There is a Walgreens next door and enough fast food outlets within the mile to keep you contented all holiday. What I really like about this hotel was the location. You had the Disney parks literally 10 minutes down the road and the Universal Parks about 20 minutes. You have a lake next to the hotel, a kids play park and parking right outside your room. I literally parked in front of our door. I see other people have questioned the security of the rooms and honestly, our door was secure and we had no problems or concerns with it. As for sugar ants, we had some but not enough to make us freak out. As I said, if your using the Best Western as a place to rest your weary head after a long day in the parks then you'd be fine staying here, if your looking for luxury and refinement then perhaps this isn't for you! Admitedly if I was returning anytime soon then this wouldn't be my first choice as there are other hotels along the strip, but it also wouldn't be ruled out if it was the only choice.

First let's start with the cleanliness. The shower head was completely moldy and disguisting. The sugar ants where ridiculous. They blamed the ants on the fact that we had food in our room. Yes, we had PACKAGED food in our room and food in our mini fridge. They didn't care to fix the ant problem or even offer us another room. They did not replace any food that was swarmed with the ants. The ants were all over the sink and in the bathtub. The beds had very thin blankets and there were NO fitted sheets so we ended up throughout the night on the bare mattress since the flat sheet moved a lot. Also, we lost our water for a few hours in the middle of the day on our 2nd day there. We TRIED to call the front desk numerous times to get this fixed as well as the ant problem but there was no getting through. We had to walk to the front desk. They advertise Free Wireless Internet... Well they mean highspeed internet, not wireless... but you have to get the maintenace to come up and set it up for you. We planned on going to some of the disney parks and after waiting in line at the front office (we did not have a gps) they told me they did not know directions to the theme parks... The inside of the hotel room was almost appalling with the peeling wallpaper and dirty paint, the A/C smelled like mildew. Since we had our 2 young children with us, we were in bed around 9pm, but we could not sleep until well after midnight considering the cleaning people and maintenance pushing their carts back and forth in front of our doors about every 15 minutes or less... In the 5 days we stayed, there was not once a single towel at the pool for us. We had to request towels every time then wait at least 20 minutes for them to arrive. I know what your thinking, 'why not bring towels from your room?\" Oh that's because they only supplied us 2 towel for 4 people... I tried to call and request more, but of course, no answer at the front desk. The HEATED pools are about 50 degrees. My 3 yr old's lips turned blue it was so cold. The cleaning lady even laughed when I asked her why this is called a resort. She said it is not a resort, they just throw that on the title. Wow, really?

Now this is fine if you have a laptop with you, which we did, but if you were using an iPhone you were not getting anything unless you go & sit in the reception area. The internet was also painfully slow. Our second complaint was the hot water. We struggled to ever get above tepid & that's not acceptable for a shower. We complained & suddenly we had hot water. Though still not reliable. Another thing that bugged us was the towels. There were 3 of us in the room & yet some days we had 3 towels, others 2. Surely if you take away 3 towels, you replace them with 3 towels. It's not difficult!! The rooms themselves are of a good size with a handy safe & a fridge that is very useful. The room was also kept very clean, as were the beds which were also very comfortable. It is noisy here, with other guests chatting as they walk past the doors. This isn't helped by the gaps under the doors which let in a cold draft on cool nights. Friday mornings at about 4am, both weeks, they seemed to think it was a good idea to empty the bins. This makes one hell of a noise. Surely the staff have ears & can use some common sense by leaving this job until at least after 8am.

The made to order omelettes were especially good. The swimming pool is a good size & warm. Our 7 year old swam most days. We did not use the mini golf, or the outdoor bar, but we were there in February, so not the busiest & earnest of times. We did not use the free Theme Park transportation, as we had a hire car, but the timings that we read we ridiculous, so I'd suggest having a car or using a taxi if you want to get to &/or leave at sensible times. Other than that our stay was ok. The location on the 192 is excellent for getting to Disney parks. I am very surprised that Virgin Holidays use the hotel as on previous holidays with them the accommodation has been much better. But I hear there may be a refurbishment due soon. Personally I would never stay here again, as I could get better for the same price, and I would never recommend it as it's too tatty. But if you are just staying 1 or 2 nights (not 14 like us) then it's passable. Maybe the refurbishment & the dropping of the ridiculous resort fee would boost peoples comments.

The room itself was very basic, with cheap furnishings. It definitely has the look of a room way beyond its prime. It was adequately clean, but everything just seemed grungy. The bedding was very sparse (a sheet, blanket, and paper-thin coverlet), and we ended up freezing the first night, as the heating/ac unit cycles, so it went from cool to chilly throughout the night. The shower never got warmer than lukewarm. We complained at the desk, and the person at the desk wrote a request for maintenance to come which merely said \"shower\". My husband left a far more detailed note in the room about what was wrong with the shower, but it was not fixed.

I think it had more amenities than a 2-star but the place is definitely due for refurbishment. If the 2-star rating reflects condition, that's about the right number of stars IMO. I will give it 4-stars overall because it was a good value and the staff was friendly and helpful. Just keep your expectations in check with respect to the condition of the property. Check-in was smooth as we arrived about 3:30 pm. I had called ahead so I was prepared for the $7.50 \"resort\" fee but I feel like I'm being ripped off when I don't use whatever a resort fee is supposed cover. We used the beds, the sink, the toilet, the shower and the TV and I believe those are covered in the room rate! We did not use the pool, the safe, the coffee machine (was initially missing a part but was replaced after we dropped it off and went to dinner) or the phone which I discovered was inoperable when I tried to phone the front desk as we were leaving. The resort fee is obviously just a way to extract additional revenue, especially, from folks who use pre-paid room sites to get the room at a reduced price. If hotel management reads this review and wants to explain what we got for our $7.50, I'm sure everyone would love to know. The doors open directly to the outside. We were quite concerned when we first saw the door because it was very dirty and beat up. The door handle/locking mechanism was also a bit battered and ancient looking and it took several tries to get open because we couldn't figure out the proper slide, turn, push, open sequence for the very heavy door. The room was large with 2 full-size beds that were comfortable. The TV was ancient but it worked and there was a large mini-fridge that was very cold. There was also a table with 2 chairs. I swiped a wet washcloth across the carpet to determine the level of cleanliness because the stains give an impression of uncleanliness. Not too bad but I decided to keep my slippers on at all times. The AC/wall heater was old and worn. The control knob positions did not correlate to the settings printed on the panel. After some experimentation, I determined one of the mystery settings was \"heat with thermostat\" so we could keep the chill off but not cook during the night. There was free wi-fi that worked well and the water pressure in the shower was strong. If you have a noisy family, you might want to think twice about staying here. In the morning, we heard someone in the neighboring room announce it was \"time to get up\" which tells me the walls are a bit thin. We would stay again at the right price and I would recommend the room to anyone who can temper their expectations regarding the condition of the room. Pros - Staff was pleasant and helpful, excellent location, plenty of parking near room, large vanity area, comfortable beds, big and cold mini-fridge, mini coffee maker with 4 packs of coffee, good water pressure in the shower. Cons - $7.50 \"resort\" fee, stained carpet that gives the impression of uncleanliness, heating/AC unit controls that were a guessing game, 29\" non-flat screen television (interesting trying to watch a bball game, tiny players), grungy entry door, tricky entry door handle.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Ulm, MN", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than I Expected...\u201d", "Author": "AlumniGuy", "ReviewID": "UR123414156", "Content": "My family and I typically do the unadvised and spend a day at one of the Disney parks between Christmas and the New Year.

We called the office and within 3 minutes, a gentleman arrived and showed us to a room next door that was prepared and ready. It is a motel with exterior entrances and our room faced one of at least 2 pools on the property. It was too cold to use but looked nice. There was also a free small mini-golf course on site but again we were unable to enjoy it. The wireless internet was complimentary and worked well. Free breakfast was not included but we paid the $8/person and enjoyed a VERY nice buffet there at the hotel. It included made to order omelettes, a wide variety of fresh fruit, bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, grits, etc. If you stay here, don't miss it! This is one of the closest hotels to Animal Kingdom and that was our destination...very easy to get there (maybe 7 minutes) but do get directions for getting back as it is a bit tricky. They offer a free shuttle to the Disney parks and a couple other Orlando theme parks but the times they offered didn't work for us. There is a Walgreens next door where we were able to grab some ponchos and a variety of snacks for the Disney parks...I recommend it as we saved a bundle!!! There are also an abundance of budget and family friendly restaurants nearby. All in all, we were pleased with our stay (especially for the price). It's not a luxury resort by any means so if you come expecting that, you'll be disappointed. I believe there is new ownership here and they are working to make improvements.

Two people staying in two different rooms in the same hotel can have completely opposite views of the place, simply based on their own personal expectations. My family and I spent 3 weeks here over Christmas/New Year and, having never been to the States before, had no idea what to expect. I read the reviews beforehand and some were good, some were no so good, but the not so good ones were for things like s in the carpet ......... well, it's a 3* hotel, are we really bothered about the stain - are they expected to replace the whole carpet for one stain. No, I'd rather pay a little less and ignore the stain or staff not being friendly. This hotel is situated on a highway, so not necessarily somewhere where you (presumably) have booked to chill at the hotel for the duration of your holiday, so if the receptionist isn't smiley and bending over backwards, does that really matter. Personally, I couldn't have been more happy with my choice. The staff were soooooo accommodating, I was gobsmacked. Any problem/query we had was addressed immediately and everything they did, they did with a smile and \"no problem\" or \"you're welcome\" which was completely sincere. I'm amazed that anyone would feel the need to comment \"Terrible\", but there's an example of differing expectations! My only gripe was the rollaway bed, where it was folded for long periods of time, the springs were distorted and caused lots of uproar with my children, all NOT wanted to sleep on it. We ended up returning it and buying a inflatable bed, but the hotel were kind enough to provide bedding free of charge and waived the cost of the 5 nights that we did use the rollaway. Basically, I think it's probably ok for a short stay over, but not a long one (3 weeks in our case). The two double beds were more comfortable that mine at home ....... if I could've fitted them in my case, I would've ;) Anyway, I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Location: This is the best bit, not only is it a very short drive to Disney etc the locale provides a number of excellent restaurants all within walking distance. Red Lobster, you couldn't buy prawns in the UK for what you get a lobster here for, Carabbas, excellent Italian restaurant, great food and atmosphere. Buffalo Wild Wings, big sports bar serving good food at great prices and if you are brave enough to try the Wild hot sauce on your wings you are a braver man than me. Shonneys for a great breakfast. I could go on and on but you get the picture. It's just so nice to get back from a day out and wander across the road for a good meal and a drink without having to drive to get there. In addition there is a big supermarket across the road and a Walgreens in the car park park for food and stuff plus all the usual souvenir shops within walking distance. All in all this is great hotel, three pools, bar, restaurant and a good holiday gym. Bits that need attention: This hotel is nearly 40 years old and is not the type of hotel popular with Americans. I think its something to do with the open plan nature of the place. My feeling is that they prefer somewhere more enclosed from a security perspective. That said the hotel is a good area with night security not that we have ver encountered any problems of that nature. Decor: The place could do with in some places a lick of paint but I understand that the new owners have an upgrade plan that was being started whilst we were there in November so hopefully this can be resolved. Resort charge: I just can't work this one out. You can add an extra $3.00 per day to your stay person for this but what is it for. I have asked but never really got a satisfactory answer. My feeling is that you pay for your stay and that should be it. The charge isn't hidden Ijust don't know what you get for it. In house food: With so much local competition I feel that the new owners really need to look at the pricing of their breakfasts and the on site Pizza Hut especailly when you can walk 50 yards down the road to CiCi's Pizza and get a 15\" pizza freshly cooked for \u00a33.50 or an all you can eat buffet for about \u00a35.50. I feel that it would be of great benefit to the owners and patrons to compete with the local eateries than just hope that you will eat there because you are staying there. Air Conditioning: Boy is it noisy. Fortunately I sleep with the Gods so rarely does it disturb me but I have been told by the boss that when it comes on in the middle of the night it sounds like a helicopter is landing in the room. My personal opinion is drink Marguaritas and you wont here it. Seriously though I again think it ia an age thing but it does need addressing. Summation: Would I recommend this hotel to my friends and family. In the blink of an eye. Unfortunaely it is unlikely I will be returing in the near future as it is now difficult to convince my 19 year old son that \"It's a Small World\" is the best ride in Orlando and that he rally should queue to get his photo taken with Mickey Duck.

There is a Walgreens shop 30 seconds walk from the hotel which is open 24hours, they sell everything under the sun, Imagine a mix between a mini Tesco, Boots, Co-op, Toys R us and you could be somewhere close. there is also a large supermarket approx 5 mins walk across the road similar to Tesco which is near a TGI Fridays where you can get an amazing meal with truly amazing service.

Being just the two of us, we wanted to enjoy a Disney / Universal holiday with our hotel as more of a base camp than an all-encompassing focal point of our trip - and for that the Lakeside was a perfect destination. On both visits the rooms were immaculate, well-equipped for our needs, comfortable, spacious and pleasant. While it's not the Four Seasons, it certainly exceeded our expectations for the price that we paid. The hotel is very well equipped for everything - the on-site store in the main building was perfect for a morning coffee and for the little snacks to keep one going, the Pizza Hut on-site was excellent and really good value, Hurricane Sam's was a great place to watch sport and enjoy a beer, the pools were very clean and a nice temperature and the little things like the basketball courts, the miniature golf and the pool bars really add to the value. There were other services available such as stamps, Internet access, phones and laundry which while we didn't use, we saw they represented good value. We also rented a car from the onsite rental team who did us a great deal and were really helpful with everything. The staff were all very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. Rich, in particular, who worked in the Hurricane Sam's Bar within the main building was brilliant - really friendly and chatty, took the time to talk to us about the NFL and NBA, and mixed some excellent cocktails for us. He was a pleasure to deal with, remembering our names and faces when we went back some 18 months later. The location is a perfect base for a Disney holiday - if you rent a car then it is around 10 minutes to the main Disney entrances. If you don't rent a car (like us on first visit) then the hotel's shuttle service was fantastic - convenient times, friendly drivers and very clear and easy pick-up locations. They were on time every day and really are a great way to do the parks. Nearby the site are all the things you could want - restaurants and bars within a 5 minute walk, a Walgreens next door is literally a stone throw away, and just about every fast-food chain is within a 5 minute walk from the door to the room. While a car is handy for trips to Busch Gardens, Florida Mall et al, we went 2 weeks on our first visit wihtout one and it was never an issue. In addition to the shuttle buses to the park, there is so much within walking distance, and taxi fares are so cheap in comparison to the UK that if you are there for Disney you really won't need one. I'd reccomend this hotel to anybody who is looking to do Disney - but want the parks and the Disney experience to be the lasting memory of their holiday. Again, it doesn't try to be an all-out 5-star experience (and to be fair, you wouldn't expect that from the price) - however the staff, the services, the location and the convenience it provides as a base camp certainly earn it a 5-star rating from us.

We stayed here a few years ago when it was the Best Western Lakeside and liked it, so booked it again on the strength of that and it's good Trip Advisor rating at the time. I'd been a little concerned about the recent falling rating and mixed reviews but have to say that we found it pretty much as we remembered it when we got there which was something of a relief! Our room was on the ground floor in Building 7 overlooking the car park, which meant it was really quiet, and had everything we needed including a fridge with freezer compartment, large safe, decent shower, ample space and free wifi which wasn't the fastest in the world but pretty reliable and fine for basic web browsing, checking email etc. Our room was made up every day, towels changed when we left them on the floor in the bathroom (if you leave them on the rail, they assume you're happy to reuse them), and overall we were pretty comfortable. We had an issue with the safe running out of batteries on our second morning but this was dealt with promptly after reporting it to reception so no complaints on the service front. As far as the rest of the hotel goes, we used a couple of the hotel's pools a few times, had cinnamon rolls from the hotel store for breakfast most mornings (they do a breakfast buffet but we were trying not to overeat too much!) and had dinner in the bar/restaurant several times during our stay when we'd had a big lunch or just didn't fancy driving out to eat in the evening - we found the menu to be simple but tasty (the deep fried cheesecake is fantastic!) and really liked the relaxed atmosphere in there, aided greatly by Richard who was fab and really, really friendly. We also used the hotel laundry halfway through our trip - a single load washed and dried cost $5 - and made use of other handy facilities the hotel has such as a stamp vending machine and post box for sending postcards. Where this hotel really stands out is in its location - as well as being a five minute drive from World Drive (I think as the crow flies it's closer to some of the Disney Parks than a lot of the Disney hotels) there's a Walgreens Pharmacy right next door which we found handy for picking up multipacks of Evian and a few other bits and bobs, and various restaurants within spitting distance including Cici's, TGI Fridays, Giordanos, Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba's Italian Grill. We did have a couple of niggles during our stay - the aircon units in the rooms are on the noisy side, we'd have liked the bedding to be a bit more substantial (we missed having a proper duvet/quilt to snuggle into), and we had an unfortunate visitor in our bed one night in the shape of a tiny bug which must have flown in from outside at some point and bit us overnight, although when we alerted reception to this they were apologetic. The hotel does need a bit of a lick of paint in some places, and it's not the sort of hotel we'd holiday in if staying in the UK (when most/all of the holiday cost goes on the hotel and so we want more in the way of luxury and mod cons), but if you're after a Disney/Universal holiday and just want a decent hotel with decent facilities in a good location then you can't go far wrong with this place in my opinion and we'd definitely consider staying here again!", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDecent for the money\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Maverick182", "ReviewID": "UR118148197", "Content": "The resort is only a few miles from Disney World and from all the tourist buzz, restaurants and souvenir shops.

The maid service is great room was cleaned and tidied everyday with plenty of towels and they were very friendly the few times we ran in to them. The free shuttles are ok but had a few problems with the shuttle bus back from universal as the company seemed to try and over fill them and the divers had to sort this out however this is no fault of the hotel. When we stayed a storm took out the guest internet but the reception staff were great and let us use their computers to access the web when needed I believe the most helpful was Kathy! Reception can get a little busy but this is due to the number of check ins but even at the busiest times we didn't wait long and check out was very quick.

Our plane arrived at 9 in the a.m.we gathered our bags, van and got something to eat,but were still hours ahead of check in which is at 3 p.m. The service desk not only allowed us to check in early, but also gave us adjoining rooms poolside for no extra charge.(should be $10.each room,each night) The help at the desk was friendly and prompt. Our rooms were clean,quiet,comfortable with excellent cleaning service. A couple times we needed extra towels or washcloths(7 of us traveled and at times took showers twice a day) and when we called the front desk they sent more towels out quite quickly. The pools are huge, and spotless with plenty of chairs and tables. There are also places around the pool where you can sit in the shade.Even though we went to Disney and Universal,days at the pool were by far the kids favorite days. We traveled with a 6,7,9,17 and 20 year old and everyone loved it here. Super close to every kind of restaurant you could want..ranging from fast food to steakhouse. Less than 10 minutes to the gates of Disney..super easy access..and around 15 min. to Universal and SeaWorld.There is a Walgreens right next door and a CiCis pizza where all7 of us ate for $35!!!We budgeted $2500. for food for the 2 weeks there and didn't come close to spending it all because of all the economical places to eat. We also went to the super Target less than 5 minutes up the street for food and other needs. With the fridge in each room we were able to buy milk,soda and juice and other snacks. The prices were the same you would pay anywhere..not marked up at all.With this hotel, there is no reason to pay those crazy prices Disney charges..The landscaping is beautiful and its fun at night to walk down the strip at night with all the lights and gift shops.We went to see a timeshare, and although the rooms were nice, I have to say I would choose Lakeside over it.The only thing I think they could improve are the shuttle times offered to take you into the parks.It is a free shuttle, which saves you $13. a day in parking at Disney and $15. at Universal, but we like to be at the park when it opens and the shuttle picks you up around 10.Still for free, it adds to the savings for sure Also has free wireless internet..I talked to a man in Disney and he told me they were charging him $15. a day for internet, and he said his rooms were just ok...Don't hesitate for a minute to stay here...We only paid 1100. for 2 rooms for 2 weeks!!!Excellent deal.

The carpet in our room was also tired with a few stains in the centre. The curtains were extremely old looking.

There were plenty of places to eat within walking distance or a short drive. The grocery store was a mile or two up the road. We bought suveniers at the Walgreens across the parking lot from BW and saved a fortune on Disney items. We also saved money on water by refilling our sports bottles in the lobby water fountain each day.

Inside this store/Pizza Hut they had a bookcase where you could borrow or trade a used book, and they had a collection of board games you could borrow. That would have been very nice on a rainy day. Most people used their own towels at the pool, but I did notice a bin with towels in a nearby corridor. We took advantage of these on our last day so we wouldn't have to travel with wet towels. I also discovered lockers in the restroom near the pool. You need to bring your own lock, but it's nice to be able to lock up your room key, camera etc if everyone in your party is in the pool. The bar at the pool was cute and you could order food there too. We were there Easter week and the theme parks were open until 1 am. It was noisy when families returned to their rooms, and also early in the am when people were leaving for the parks. This would have happened at any hotel. Getting to WDW was quick and easy by car.

We were mis-informed that the scheduled shuttle would have multiple scheduled drop-offs and pick-ups at each park, not just a single at a random time. Before our arrival, we purchased a Sea World/Busch Gardens package, where a Busch Gardens shuttle would meet us at Sea World. We ended up having to spend around $60 for parking, because we had to meet the shuttle early in the morning and also drive back to the hotel after the Busch shuttle dropped us off back at Sea World. We were very fortunate to have rented a car to get around Orlando, because we did not have the access to the shuttle like we thought we would. In addition, housekeeping did not stock amenities to the guest room...basic shampoo & soaps throughout the stay. I thought the front desk did an excellent job handling the sold-out hotel. We did not expect to get our room until 4PM, because of the craziness in the lobby.

While the man at the desk wasn't particularly cheerful, he was friendly enough. Got up to the room (Building 5 - Room 256) It was in the pet friendly area with a view of the \"lake\" and mini golf. When we first got there I heard a dog barking and got a little worried that we'd be hearing it all night long but never heard or saw a dog for the rest of our stay. Room was clean and I loved that the vanity area was outside the actual bathroom - real time saver not having to wait if all you wanted to do is brush your teeth and someone was using the shower or something.

One time she'd be there and gone by the time we got back from breakfast (11 am) and on our last day she didn't knock on our door until after 3 p.m. But most days we were out and about at the pool or at the parks so it didn't matter to us. The lady who was taking care of our room even stopped me at the door as I was leaving the room and she was walking by to ask me if everything was OK and if we needed anything else. I was very pleased with that. Our very first night we did not want to go anywhere so after we enjoyed the pool area for a bit we just went to the Pizza Hut on-site and sat outside and relaxed.

The resort fee is a joke. The mini golf would barely entertain a small child. The pools are ok. We didn't eat at the buffet, but there are other buffets less than two minutes away that offer a price of $3.99 compared to the $9.50 the hotel charges. Got pizza one afternoon - $7 for a personal pizza, three breadsticks, and a drink.. Probably the best deal they had, as a grilled cheese sandwich ran almost $6! Went down one morning to purchase a ticket for my son to get into Disney. The ticket saleswoman saw me coming from the ATM and walked away!!! Decided it was worth the wait in line at Disney rather than have any money go to the hotel for the sale. At check out, the employee barely spoke to me or the other customers - he was answering the phones and just pushing papers in front of people to sign. Even when he was off of the phone, he didn't make eye contact and just got me out as quick as possible. We got this on priceline for $27. I wouldn't have paid more and won't stay again.

Getting to our hotel room we were greeted with overflowing trash bins and a building block that needed a good power washing to get rid of the accumulated grim on the passageway floors and windows on the exterior of the rooms. The interior of the room was dated but adequate although the mattresses were soft and needed replacement. The first indication of poor service was the fact that the carpet had not been vacuumed upon our arrival. That was followed by forgetting to leave towels in the room when it was cleaned to forgetting the room entirely on at least one occasion. To be fair, the hotel front desk was responsive when I complained, but is this really the way to run a hotel? The advertised amenities also did not live up to expectations. The outdoor \"heated\" pool was not heated and was without pool towels on a consistent basis. The gym had poorly maintained equipment, including a broken and mostly empty water dispenser, and was also without towels on 3 of the 4 times that I used it (probably taken from guests using the nearby pool). The \"highspeed\" internet was not fast and had a very, very weak signal that would fade in and out every few minutes, a very frustrating experience.

We are from the UK and have stayed here 3 times so far, the third of which we held our wedding reception on the decking overlooking the lake, two of our friends have also taken thier families here on our recommendation, once where we all travelled together and once where they travelled alone. On none of these varied occassions over a 5 year period have we ever encountered a single issue with the staff or facilities at Lakeside, or heard any complaints from any other guests either. We were originally attracted to the hotel by a combination of the good value prices and the fantastic loacation, and frankly would have been quite happy with 'adequate' as we mainly wanted to use the hotel as a base for the theme parks, however I can't think of a single area where the hotel could be marked as merely adequate. We have always found the cleanliness to be of a good standard, both within the rooms and the hotel grounds as a whole, the hotel staff have always been bright, bubbly and helpful, the Pizza Hut is always popular with the kids and the rare occasions we have needed to ask for staff to come to our room (once to replace a lightbulb in the bathroom, once because we locked ourselves out) someone was on-hand in less than 5 minutes. Equally as attractive is the hotel's immediate location. a 24-hour supermarket with chemist/drug store is just across the parking lot, there are 3 well known chain burger places within 5-10 minutes walk, a great Crazy Golf situated next door and approx. half a dozen resteraunts also within a very short walk. The '5 minutes from Disney' mentioned in the UK holiday brochures refers to the entrance to the Disney estate as a whole and not to the actual theme park entrances, and while strictly speaking this is accurate I can understand how some people can find this misleading, however any problem people have with this description should surely be raised with the package operators who print the brochure and not the hotel. 15 mins door-to-door is a fairer idea for anyone who wanted a more exact timeframe. As mentioned earlier we decided to hold our wedding reception here on our most recent visit and the events staff could not have been more helpful and accomodating, the bar staff even arranged for us to catch a UK soccer match on the bar's big screen that was shown before the bars usual opening time. After 3 great stays here our family could'nt imagine staying anywhere else when we visit Florida, we will definately stay here again, would recommend this hotel to our friends and family without a moments hesitation.

The rooms aren't for those who are looking for luxury, however I'm sure those people are not looking for a mid-range priced hotel. It wasn't terrible at all, but if it wasn't next to Disney World it would be $50/night less. As well we initially booked a king room, and after traveling all day, finding the place in our rental car, and bringing our stuff up the stairs to the room - it wasn't a king room. It was fixed right away - in fact the staff member was really nice and easy going, but still a bit of a hassle considering the lobby was packed and lined up. There's also a 24 hour Walgreens right on the property which is fantastic - especially considering each room has a small fridge (another frill that can make a big difference). And lots of restaurants within walking distance. It's tough to find a place you will be comfortable with that won't cost you some ridiculous amount in that area.

We had reservations here for 2 days prior to our stay on the Disney property, and I cannot get over the waste of money that was for us. We attempted to travel during the snow storm that hit Dallas, so after 18 hours of trying to get to Orlando, and 3 canceled planes later we finally arrived at 1 am to the hotel. When our reservations were made online, our confirmation said that breakfast would be included, however when we checked in the RUDE woman at the front desk said \"no breakfast is not included here\" and just pointed to a sign that said all Best Westerns were indepently owned and operated so they reserved the right to change or modify services advertised. We showed her the confirmation and all she did was shrug her shoulders, gave us the print out and said \"sign here.\" There are no elevators, and no one to help with bags so we had to lug a weeks worth of luggage + 2 two year olds up stairs in the middle of the night. When the door to our rooms opened, my heart sank. There were mismatched sheets and a scratchy top blanket on the bed and no comforter. The room smelled like something had died in it, the bathroom was dirty, and I wouldn't even consider taking my shoes off on that floor. Absolutely the worst two nights of sleep I'd ever had! Between the uncomfortable mattress & pillows and the air conditioner that was uneven at best and left the room horribly humid, I couldn't wait to get out of that misery. My son woke up early the next morning so I took him on a walk around the property - the \"lake\" is a nasty run off pond that smelled worse than our room, the playground equipment looked like it might fall over, and the pool wasn't much better. We walked to the lobby to get some information on the area and find out the best way up to Daytona for the day, and the two desk attendants spent a good 5 minutes chatting before I was even acknowledged to ask them a question. Our friends stayed in the room next door and we could hear every word of their conversation - and they aren't loud people! I'm shocked people have had good experiences here. I'm not even one who has been spoiled by the Ritz or anything - typically we stay at a Hilton or Marriott but I've stayed in a Motel 6 in West Texas that was better kept than this!

The pictures are ALL posted here on TripAdvisor. Please do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere.

I would, however, like to share my disappointment in the Best Western Lakeside in Kissimmee, FL. I never write reviews, but I believe that the filthiness and unsuitableness of this facility implores me to take the time to provide more feedback. Upon arrival to the hotel, we first noticed the poorly lit (essentially unlit) parking lot and the ill-kept condition of the property. However, having already paid for the hotel and with it having a 3-star rating on a discount travel site, I felt certain that the room itself would be suitable. When checking in, I was told that no king rooms were available. After explaining multiple times that I had booked this facility solely due to its offering a choice of bed on the website, the manager of the property was called to the desk, where she proceeded to somehow \"find\" an available king room. When we finally entered the room, we were put off by the overall dankness of the place, but hoped that a bit of time with the a/c on would help. It did not. The staleness and dankness never dissipated. Despite these warning signs, we were excited to get dressed and go out to ring in the New Year, so we attempted to shower. After turning on the shower and waiting for several minutes, we determined that we had no hot water. After a call to the front desk, someone from maintenance was sent to the room. After he examined the bathroom and sink, and ran the water himself for awhile, he concluded that the water was as warm as it would get. This seemed to satisfy the hotel, but it was not acceptable to us, nor would it have been acceptable in any hotel in which I have ever stayed. In the meantime, while waiting for the repairs we expected, we began to attempt to make ourselves comfortable on the bed and loveseat provided. After pulling off the very old, worn bedspread, we encountered threadbare sheets that, despite not being the appropriate size for the bed, had been simply draped atop a dilapidated mattress that had no pad or cover. This situation is untenable in a place where a mattress serves a multitude of people, and the state of the mattress was certainly not fresh or clean. Also, the three pillows provided were cased in unmatched linens, leading us to wonder if one or more of them had simply been left by another guest. I believe it is very reasonable to expect that a hotel provide its guests with a minimum level of confidence that they are not risking their health by staying at the property. Determining that the bed was unacceptable, we moved to the loveseat provided. As I turned on the lamp in the corner nearest the loveseat, I noticed the shade was severely stained. The stains appeared to be water stains, and given the mugginess of the room, and my experience in professional real estate investing and development, I began to suspect that the room had recently suffered a flooding of some sort. After turning on the lamp, I went to the loveseat. There is no way to describe my reaction, other than I was aghast at the condition and filthiness of it. The loveseat itself was threadbare to the point of seeing the cushioning at places, and in other places had stains that, while they may not have actually been, looked close enough to bodily secretions that we were extremely disconcerted. At this point, despite the front desk having told us quite some time ago that we would receive new bedding that never arrived, we determined that the property was untenable. Being that even the internet connection was not working, we were forced to set out on a last minute hotel search. The result of these circumstances caused us a large amount of stress, as we were unfamiliar with the area, and New Year's Eve is a particularly busy time for hotels. In the past year, I have spent upwards of 40 nights in various hotels and hundreds of nights over the course of my life, with these hotels ranging from Super 8 to Ritz-Carlton properties, with several Best Western facilities mixed in. I can say with confidence that this hotel was easily the worst property I have ever checked into. It is not only unworthy of three stars on any website, but it is not worthy of a Best Western flag. Perhaps it was simply the room we were given (since the manager had to \"find\" it, maybe it wasn't intended to be booked), but I can only base my comments on my experience.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gourock, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!

We were driving to Disney World and got there a day earlier than expected and were not able to check-in at our Disney property hotel. This hotel was recommended to us by AAA because of its affordability and proximity to Disney World. We arrived at the hotel at 11PM. I was immediately struck by how dirty the hallways and stairwells were. They haven't been painted or powerwashed in some time and it gave the hotel an overall shabby feel. When we arrived at our room, it was dark and outdated. The door to the room did not close well. We had to jiggle the handle several times to ensure that the lock was catching. The corners of the bathroom were dingy looking. I could have dealt with all of this considering the price and the short period of time that we would be spending there. But the next morning as we were packing up our things and getting ready to leave, I noticed 3 small bugs crawling on the bed that I had slept in with my 3 year old daughter. We called the front desk and maintenance arrived. They confirmed that these were bed bugs. We asked them what we should do and they told us to wash our clothes and dry them for a while at a high heat. They didn't know what hotel mgmt would do. The maintenance people left and we continued to pack up our things. Noone from hotel mgmt contacted us in the room. We loaded up the car with the intention of heading to the nearest laundromat and then I went to the front desk. I told them that I was checking out of the room with the bed bugs and I was told that they were waiving the resort fee of $15. I thought that they should have refunded all of our money. I inquired about the nearest laundromat and shared that I should receive more money off the cost of my room since I would now have to launder all of my clothes that were already clean otherwise. He told me that they have a laundromat but that if I wanted to get more money off I would need to speak to a manager. I said I would like to speak to the manager. I waited for close to 10 minutes and no manager ever came to the desk. The man at the check in finally returned to me with free laundry tokens to do one load of laundry. At this point, I just wanted to get out of there so I could tend to my clothes, head to a gas station to vacuum our suitcases and get my family to our Disney World resort which I assure you was 110% better than this hotel. Seven days after my stay at the Best Western bed bug bites have appeared all over my body. This has been a completely awful nightmare. I am praying that we caught the problem and have not brought these bugs back to our home with us. It is an abomination that hotel mgmt. never attempted to contact me and offer an apology. I understand that bed bugs are unfortunately a problem that many hotels are having but the way that this was dealt with is completely unacceptable. Please never give business to this property. And please, when you check in to any hotel, do a thorough check of the bed (mattresses, sheets, pillows, under the mattress,etc. I would not wish this experience on anyone. All for an 8 hour stay before what was supposed to be a stress-free vacation to Disney World. Also, as an aside, during the short time that I was there, I noticed that since the rooms were non-smoking, the guests would stand right outside their rooms to smoke. With no designated smoking area, it made for an unpleasant walk back and forth to the main building with small children having to walk through people's second hand smoke.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwesterner007", "Title": "\u201cPleasant, clean and inexpensive.\u201d", "Author": "Midwesterner007", "ReviewID": "UR85718996", "Content": "This hotel was very good for our stay in the Orlando area.

Its location is perfectly situated to Disney's World Drive about one mile away set back from the main Route 192. The staff was very welcoming and you could tell they would do anything to make your stay enjoyable. There are three large U-shaped buildings all designed around a huge pool as the centerpiece for each with a kiddie pool also. Each night they put out a large projection tv and set it at poolside that offered sports and regular shows. That was a great way to stay with the kids, socialize with others and enjoy the beautiful weather after a long day at the theme parks. Also for children they had a basketball court, playground area and mini-golf. Our building was located with easy access to the main lobby that included a great restaurant, snack shop, game room for kids, and a Pizza Hut. Just out from the parking lot is located a 24 hour Walgreen's for all of your needs at lower prices. The hotel offered free wireless internet that at many hotels are offered at an additional daily fee. The rooms were clean, newly refurbished, and spacious enough for two double beds and a sitting area with a table and three chairs, along with a smallish new bathroom with the vanity area at the end of the main room. All of the furnishings appeared to be new. To receive all of this at a price in the high-$30's per night was the greatest value I have ever gotten in approximately twenty trips to the Orlando area. I am absolutely staying there every time I return and am still shocked at the price, convenience, perks and quality that outdoes many of the finer hotels.

The room was cleaned daily although sometimes the standard was better than others and the beds were changed and clean towels put in the bathroom. If reception needed to be called any querys were delt with promptly and efficently. The breakfast buffet was good value(around 16 dollers)for 2 adults kids under sixteen ate free, we tried other breakfast buffets and found the hotel to be of a better standard and again good value and tips were included in the price..my son loved the breakfasts and there was a cheff who would cook omlettes or anything you wanted fresh, the standard was very very good and tasty! We went one night to Hurrican Sams which is on the hotel premise and although the meal was ok(not outstanding or anything), the menu was very simple however the staff were extreamely nice and service was good. The hotel was a good base for going to the parks or anywhere we wanted to go, and it had a lot of fast food places around it and we walked to some of them which was handy, as my teenage son would not walk the length of himself normally.. The hotel pool(s) were good, nice and clean and there was a pool bar and lots of sunbeds and tables and chairs to sit around it, there was also laundrettes which were adequate to do the job. Like I mentioned before although the rooms were a bit dated and maybe in need of some refurbishment they were perfectly functunal and the staff were very helpful and pleasant, the only gripe we had was on our first night there one of the staff was quite pushy and insistant that we have a look and make a date to view a timeshare property, at first we did not know what she was going on about, but when she asked us lots of questions and asked for twenty dollers to secure our 'breakfast' and two hour talk, she also said there was NO preassure to buy and that we would get $70 dollers back..we were not interested but she kept going on..that was if anything, the only drawback and dissapointment for us(we were tired and just wanted our room keys..however dont think she was a best western staff member..I would definately recomend this hotel and aks people to bare in mind it wasnt five star ,but a perfectly decent place to stay with helpful staff and good location and if you have small kids it has crazy golf, basketball, sand pits, play parks, and free swimming toys in pool, we would definately go back!

We had read mixed reviews about Best Western Lakeside but decided to keep an open mind. We arrived in Florida late Friday night and since it was the first time hiring a car we ended up getting lost, when we finally arrived at Best Westen we had almost been up 24 hours, we were greeted very warmly, but i believe this was with the intention of trying to get us to upgrade to their new rooms \"for only $25 a night\" after we declined and asked for our room key so that we could get some rest, she asked for a credit card incase we ordered stuff from the room, so being as tired as we were we just handed the card over. It wasn't until the next day that I thought we had better check if they had put a hold on the card, so when we enquired about this, the man at the desk said that they would hold $140 for the whole stay, $10 a night. I thought thats fine we'll just make sure we dont overspend. but later in the holiday when we were checking the balances of the cards it turned out they were actually holding $190, when we queried it she said the computer had done this of its own accord, we asked if she could release it and pay a cash deposit and she said that she did, however at checkout it turns out she didn't and blatantly lied to us about it. Anyway to get to the most important part if you have early check in like many Virgin customers do. My family and I went down to Downtown Disney at 8.30am with our suitcases to get them checked in, we decided that we were going to have breakfast out and then go back to the room and shower before we had to leave. We returned to our room at aprox 10.45am, we had been advised when we arrived that we would be required to check out at 12 noon, so you can imagine our distress at returning and all of our hand luggage, coats, toiletries and food and juice in the fridge all gone and the beds were all made for the next guests. I phoned reception and they put me through to house keeping, the maid and i assume her boss turned up at the room with our bags and what she said was all of our belongings, we checked all of the bags, my son had over $100 worth of lego in his bag and my daughter had her purse and dsi in hers, which might i add when returned were all open! Nothing seemed to be missing. I asked about our food and toiletries and she said they had all been thrown out, this consisted of juices and food as our flight wasn't until later that night. As if this wasn't infuriating enough the maid who i will not name thought this was hillarious. We recieved what she said was all the coats in a Best Western carrier bag and when i poured them out my coat was missing, I made sure the maids stayed until everything was checked and when i said to her my coat was missing she laughed and told me to come with her. I followed her to her trolly/cart where all the towels, sheets etc were kept, she moved a pile of towels to the side on the trolley and she had an Aladins cave of stuff hidden there, she actually handed me someone elses cardigan, I told her that it wasn't mine and pointed mine out to her. I was so furious i expressed my dissapointment at the front desk at check out and asked what their policy was regarding checkout time, the girl said that sometimes if a room looks vacant the maid will just go in and clean it, when i mentioned the amount of belongings in the room she had the nerve to turn around and say that sometimes people leave things, my reply to that was \"you really expect me to believe that people leave four hand luggage bags, four coats, all of their toiletries and juices and food in the fridge?\" i told her that we all expected to have a quick shower before we left but now that all of our stuff was gone this was not possible, this was not even responded to, i also followed on by saying that this would be fair enough if the maid went to the room after 12noon instead of going in mid morning. Her reply to me then was \"what exactly is it you would like me to do?\" I was so angry I had to just tell her to make sure that her staff wait untill proper check out time before going into the rooms and that she was lucky i didn't call the police. Thinking on it now i wish i had, i feel that my belongings were stolen and i had no way to make sure that we had everything as it was all gone. I feel like my trust has been violated. These maids were tipped every day, and it wasn't until at the airport that i realised that we had money sitting on the table and she'd taken the lot, we hadn't had a chance to sort it out before she took it. She must have thought all of her birthdays had come at once. I'm trying to think of a positive side because i know i was having a good time before this happened. The rooms were clean enough although i don't think they hovered the whole time we were there. I will not be staying here again simply because i do not trust them, i do believe she was keeping my coat for herself and she had gone through all of the childrens bags. I cannot express how dissapointed i am and i can only hope that nobody else experiences this kind of treatment. I would advise anyone who stays here just to clarify that on the day of check out you will not have a maid go in to your room in the morning while your out and take all of your stuff and to give proof of the amount of money being held on any cards. It would have been very embarrassing if we had overspent and our card been declined because we didn't know they were keeping $50 dollars more.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bracknell, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great place\u201d", "Author": "lordelpus", "ReviewID": "UR83971897", "Content": "Check in was fast and very efficient and they gave you a map to show you exactly where your room was.

I stopped at the pizza hut in the lobby and ordered a pizza (which is a great breakfast if you put it in the provided fridge).

The beds were small; they say they are a double but honestly I don't think two adults could fit comfortably on one bed. the next evening when I came back housekeeping had left all the lights on in my room, which didn't bother me too much since it was nice to have that light when I returned from a long day at the parks. Unfortunately they also turned the air on super cold and so I had to turn the heat on, and in Florida the first few minutes that a heater is on, it smells. I also noticed that my dirty towels were gone, but housekeeping didn't replace them. There is the daily resort fee, so that adds about another $8 to your nightly hotel fee.

You can take a free transfer, monorail or ferry to other Disney parks ad free transport to water parks. The hotel drivers are very helpful, but make sure you tip them and they going to tell you everything you need to know.

I will be honest, a lot of reviews seemed quite negative and I was worried. I am a born worrier anyway and our last Florida holiday was to Disney's Caribbean Beach, so I was beside myself, thinking of the disappointment that lay ahead. I even rang Virgin begging to swop hotels, but it was too late and too expensive. So we got on the plane and arrived hours later at this hotel. It is located on the 192, which is a bit tacky, but you pull right off in into the hotel grounds. Checking in was very fast and they took $100 cash as a deposit as I didn't have my credit card. The reception had internet access, pay phones, a Pizza Hut takeout, ideal little store as well as a bar and restaurants. The staff were friendly and efficient. We drove to our room, which was almost identical to the Caribbean Beach's rooms. It was very clean, with iron and board, hairdryer, coffee maker, cups, a excellent size safe, fridge etc. It felt better equipt than the C.B. Out side the room was a 24 hour laundry room...very useful, a gym, two pools which were nearly always empty and clean in a pretty environment. We were also close to a little waterfall feature and the grounds were actually quite pretty. I had been expecting a hovel, but I could not have been more wrong. The cleaner came daily and was flexible if we wanted a bit of a lie in, she'd come back later when we were out. Our belongings were untouched and our bed was changed a couple of time during our three week stay. The pizza hut was idealwhen we got home to late to eat out and we'd have pizza, cola and choccies while watching the Nancy Grace repeats. If any one out there is worrying about this hotel, please stop now. It was fine, better than fine. It matched the Caribbean beach in all but location and even that wasn't too bad. It was also very sadly near an IHOP, which contributed towards my recent weight gain. We had a lovely holiday and checking out was sad, even though I got my $100 back, which I wasn't expecting as I'd made local phone calls. There is a nightly resort fee, but Virgin customers don't have to pay this, so that was another thing less to worry about. Over all, go to this hotel, not expecting luxury of course, but we spent three weeks there and we'd go back again tomorrow without hesitation.

We arrived to a twin room and swiftly rang reception to explain we were on our honeymoon and would like a kingsize bed. Reception happily moved us to a king room that was poolside, our original room wasn't. The loc ation of this room 185 was great as it was right in front of the pool and close to the amenities of the hotel, bar, rception etc. The room was very clean and quite large which was better than I had expected and there were plenty of towels for us. The room was cleaned every day and everything refreshed, so we never needed to ask for anything. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows, although slightly fluffed up, also allowed for a peaceful night. We didn't hear anything from our neighbours whilst in our room which was good, the only noisy part was the air con but you could turn the fan down at night. The weather was over 95 whilst we were there and very humid so we did have the air con on all day every day to allow us to feel normal in the room! The room had a large TV and a fridge which was large enough to fit in plenty of water and juice bottles. We walked over to the Walgreens in the parking lot and purchased a 24 pack of bottled water for about $4 which lasted us a good few days and meant we always had some cold in the fridge ready to drink. The pool was warm and always had fresh towels, which was good. It was never busy and stayed open until 11pm which meant you could go out for the day and still have a swim when we got back. The only major problem we had was the guy on the recreation/concerge desk who did try on several occasions to sell us a timeshare talk but we were firm and just said 'No' and he left us alone! The location was perfect, 5 minute drive from Disney and about 15 minutes from International drive which was ideal. We didn't use the free shuttles so I cannot comment on the service. We visited Hurricane Sam's bar nearly every evening and found a nice, relaxed atmosphere. We did notice however a few days in that a 18% gratuity was added to our bar bill every time and we had been also leaving a tip. We soon stopped this and were also dissappointed to find that some US travellers we befriended whilst we were there, were not charged this on their bill!!! Overall a great hotel, do note however there is a local resort fee payable on departure which we had already been informed about and was $3.50 a night. There was a sign on reception to say that it was $7 if you arrived direct to the hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel but there was a Carabba's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Lobster, Outback Steakhouse, Giorgiano's, TGI's all within walking distance and provided great food for our stay. Also for breakfast we stopped in at iHop, Denny's and Perkins all within a 2 minute drive of the hotel.

The room had TV with a number of channels, two double beds, shower/toilet, free safe, air conditioning and a very helpful fridge/freezer unit along with plenty of storage for clothes. Our room was quiet on a night and we had no problems with the location. Upon arrival we found that the bathroom light wasn't working, we informed reception who immediately sent someone to fix it. On site there were three swimming pools (although we only used one) which were clean and a great temperature for cooling off in! Although they're not the biggest pools they each service a different area of the hotel which meant it was never very busy at the closest one. The breakfast buffet was included in the price we paid on Expedia and was fairly nice with a variety of food provided - cereal, fruit, toast, cooked breakfast and omelettes to cook fresh when you wanted. We did notice they were charging other guests $8.99 for it which was very overpriced for the content (especially when there is a Ponderosa and Sizzler within 10-15min walking distance offering a $3.99 buffet breakfast) in addition to this price you also had to pay for juice which should be included in a \"free breakfast included\" option!! There was a Pizza Hut on site which again was overpriced considering there is a CiCi's nearby (within 2 mins walking distance) which was amazing value! We got a 15\" cheese and tomato pizza for $4.27 (inc TAX). We made good use of the free shuttle services to the theme parks, the Universal and Seaworld shuttle bus left at 7:30am, which although it was early, was great for beating ride queues and enjoying an empty park. Unfortunately the return time was 6pm for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure and 6:15pm for Seaworld which did mean you missed the fireworks. The times for the disney parks were 9:35am/10:10am and 11:35am which were nicely spread out across the morning and from each park it is easy to get to other disney parks via the free buses. There was also a shuttle at 5pm to Magic Kingdom. It would be nice if they provided a bus to one of the disney waterparks as these are slightly more difficult to get to using the disney bus service. (Blizzard Beach can be accessed from Animal Kingdom) although Typhoon Lagoon can only be accessed by going to a disney hotel first. The return times were also nicely spread out with 5.20pm, 8.30pm, 9.25pm and 10.45pm meaning you could watch the fireworks in all the parks. They also put on a later shuttle at 11.30 when Magic Kingdom was open until midnight. Overall, our stay was lovely, the staff were helpful and the amenities were never too busy meaning we didn't feel like we were staying in a large haotel. I would recommend it to a friend, however I would suggest that you stay in a room not overlooking the pool as it's open until 11pm so can get noisy when lots of kids are in there after getting back from the parks.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west midlands", "Title": "\u201cjust like extended family\u201d", "Author": "kyriacouj", "ReviewID": "UR69343420", "Content": "i have stayed at the best western lakeside 4 times in the last 4 years and as a travel agent can be really picky were i stay. the reception staff are really helpfull down to the fab cleaners that look after us so well, we try to have a pool side room as my daughter loves the location, the fact that you are so close to disney and the other attractions is a bonus but to me its the people that make us return,the pizza hut on site and the bartender in hurricane sams all help complete the hotels facilities really well. best western lakeside isnt a posh hotel your not paying posh prices so you more that get your monies worth. already booked for may 2011 and cant wait !!", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central NJ", "Title": "\u201cClose to Everything You're in Orlando FL for.\u201d", "Author": "CentralNJKeith", "ReviewID": "UR68983555", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed here during her business convention being held at the Gaylord Palms nearby.

I got the BestWestern Lakeside hotel from hotwire at a $29 a night. I did identify the hotel before I purchased it, and I purchased it because of the good reviews. Check in was a breeze.. it literally took 2 minutes with Mary Lee. She was very friendly, and made us feel welcomed. She gave us a quick run down of the hotel, checked us in, and we were off to our room. Clean, was the most important factor to me.... and it was very clean! It was not modern or terribly updated, but is was very nice. Bathroom looked new.. the beds and bed clothes, neat and clean. The TV was large, but not a flatscreen, but who cares. We never turned it on so I can't say about the reception. There is a refrigerator, that was a great plus! And the usual, hair dryer, iron/ironing board, and room safe. Everything was in great condition, and everything in order. We went to their in-hotel store to use the mircrowave, where my daughter proceeded to make a mess! She's a bit clumsy. The girl there (I didn't get her name) ran over to clean it up (although we were trying), but she was all smiles and giggles with my daughter. She was very friendly and chatty, and kept telling us not to bother trying to clean. Mind you, this is stuff we did not purchase there, we were only using the microwave, but it didn't matter. She even got us some utencils to use, and plates. She was very sweet. There was another man there, who when another family was waiting to use the mircrowave, immediately came over to show them where another was located (across the hall) so they wouldn't have to wait. He was also extremely friendly and nice. In the morning, we went there again for coffee and some cookies they had there... and the man (a different one) was also sooooo sweet and nice! The manager, Raul, was there in the morning. We chatted a bit, he was very knowledgable and friendly. I told him of my disappointment in seeing the Best Western, Downtown Disney, where we were supposed to be staying our last 8 nights. We had gone there the day before and asked to see a room... and it was HORRIBLE! Raul was very sympathetic and offered to help us switch our reservations to there. And although we really did like it there, it wasn't enough of a facility for us to spend a long vacation.

She had put a $340.00 hold on my debit card, for a room I had previously paid for through Expedia. I spent 2 days trying to straighten this out with my debit card company.

There is a fridge, hair dryer, iron, ironing board and coffee machine also a safe at not extra cost. We had breakfast there most mornings and had a couple of meals in Hurricane Sams, all good food and reasonable prices. There is a Walgreens next door which sells loads of stuff, also a Pizza Hut which we didn't use. We decided not to hire a car and used the free shuttles to the parks etc. For the most part these were not too bad, the earliest one left at 9.35am and went to Animal Kingdom, we used that one most of the time and if we were going to a different park that day we just used the Disney free transport to transfer to where we wanted to go. The shuttle to Universal went at 7.30am which we found a bit too early especially as the return shuttle was at 6pm. I think it would be better if there was a return in the middle of the day. We booked some Mears shuttle vouchers from Virgin which we found very useful and would recommend. This hotel is ideal if you are visiting the parks, if you have a car there is plenty of parking space and a very short journey to the various parks.

The windows were very thin which meant that we were woken every morning by kids running past the room or even just people talking outside. We had a pool view room and although I thought this would be nice when we checked in, I later discovered that the pool was busy right up until gone midnight (even though it was meant to close at 11pm) meaning an early night was out of the question. The air conditioning was also very noisy and kept waking me during the night. The bed was small. Following other reviews, it is definitely not a double, I would say it is a 3/4. Admittedly there are two of them but being on a holiday with my fiance, it meant that the holiday would have lost a little sparkle if we'd've had to stay in separate beds. The housekeeping service was fantastic, they made the bed every day (including on days when we stayed in bed past midday) and refreshed the towels and coffee stuff. They even placed the teddies that we won in competitions on the bed which I thought was a sweet touch. The people on the front desk were a little frosty when we arrived but there were various people on the desk throughout the holiday who seemed nicer. The breakfast place was nice. Food was good, good value and plenty of it. The bar/evening place wasn't so good with very little choice on food and slow service. Just for those who think having the pizza hut on site sounds great, it would've been great except that the prices were huge and then they added on tax, and a gratuity (i.e. charge for room service). It was very expensive and so we never bothered and just drove to the pizza hut down the road instead. I was very pleased with the free wifi internet and free parking.

Cons were hidden costs, dripping noise in ceiling (tick tick tick), no fitted sheet, replenished coffee and cream only after requests, mold in bathroom (ceiling) and cracking caulk, not many outlets, under bed had many dust bunnies, and miniature golf course was ragged. Cons explained: I got this room for $175/wk (21/night) off of Priceline. But there was a hidden hotel fee of $3.50/night for \u201camenities\u201d. This is becoming a more and more common trend, and I think hotels should be \u201couted\u201d for it. They use their pools, spas, golf courses, and internet to woo your business as part of the nightly rate, and then tell you, after the fact, that those things, while on property and pictured with your booking, are only included at an extra cost. So, we ended up with $25 (equivalent of an extra night) in fees for using the internet for a few hours and the mini golf course once. Not to mention that we paid Priceline\u2019s \u201cfees and charges\u201d that were supposed to be for the hotel\u2019s \u201cfees and charges\u201d only to be charged more \u201cfees and charges\u201d upon arrival. And don\u2019t get me started about the airlines\u2019 \u201cfees and charges.\u201d It rained, and there came a dripping noise in the ceiling. The maintenance folks said that\u2019s because a roof drain runs between the rooms at that location. It doesn\u2019t really matter when you\u2019re trying to sleep after 10 hours at Disney. Water torture is water torture. Another trend: no fitted sheets. So, if you toss and turn in the night, you end up sleeping on the surface of a mattress that god-knows-what has happened on, with a wad of sheets and blankets under your breaking back. Does it break a hotel to have a fitted sheet? The miniature golf course might pass a little time, but it\u2019s not likely to be anything you play more than once, due to its aged condition and peeling surfaces. The rest is no big deal. The pros explanation: This place has a backroad that goes straight onto Disney property after about a mile (Sherberth). It\u2019ll take you right near Animal Kingdom Lodge. It\u2019s about 10 minutes from the Disney lot to the hotel parking lot. LOTS of good eating nearby. In good weather, there were a lot of things to enjoy at the hotel: heated pool (no hot tub), paddle boats and golf, etc. And like I say, for 21/night, it was a 4 star at that rate! Walgreens is right next door, too, for chips, lunchables, toiletries, etc. Overall, a great stay for the rate, but if I paid more than $35/night for the stay, I would have been really disappointed.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vinbar", "ReviewID": "UR55267406", "Content": "We did not know anything about this hotel before arriving, so alittle anxious about our stay.

However, for our teen daughter's frequent field hockey tournaments, we usually stay in a Best Bestern. We're at BW Lakeside now for her nat'l. tournament at the Disney Sports Complex 8 minutes away. The location couldn't be beat, plus because I'm in the Best Western Rewards program, two of our nights are free (the remainder of this trip and one more stay will entitle us to more free nights).. Granted, this is not the Taj Mahal -- towels are a bit more threadbare, only one pillow to a person (although our request for another one each was qucikly accommodated). The Housekeeping staff and Front Desk staff couldn't be nicer. The grounds are beautifully maintained, and despete the honky tonk of the highway strip out front, pleasand to look at. The heated pools are larger than your typical hotel pools, and for a cool February week, not bad to swim in -- but brrrr.. . watch when you get out. I would have killed for a hottup or jacuzzi! Only lament is that they skimp on the toileteries and other amenities (no tea, only coffee in room) and the, cherrfully vibrantly colored bedcoverings show in the website photos have been replaced by drab, blackish/blue ones - not great for putting one in an \"I'm getting away from the cold, cold north\" feeling. (which may be depressing later if we're stuck in our rooms, as we've just heard there's a tornado watch for tonight.) However, we come to this tournament every year and will probably stay here again - in fact we stay at Best Western'sfor all of our daughter's far-away tournaments, both in Fla., Calif., and Pennsylvania.because of good price/value and bonus nights (what's the point of getting cushy romantic room if you're sharing it with your child!). We'll save the fabulous B&Bs and inns for a romantic getaway. I've heard others lament about the bed size at the Best Western Lakeside, but I guess it really deepends on how large you are. My husband and I slept comfortablly in full-size bed, but we're on the thin side (although what woman doesn't feel she couldn't do without losing a few pounds?!). We do have to admit that as nice as it is to have a large vanity outside the bathroom, they have definitely skimped on the bathroom size itself, making it a little dicey when changing, etc. (as we were traveling with teenage daughter). We were also in the older of the rooms, and did detect a musty smell at fist. Fortunately I anticipated that and brought a small contrainer of light linen scented air freshener, which took care of the problem; later, as air conditioner kicked it, the musty smeel .disappeared. We were also sorry breakfast wasn't included free, as is growing more customary.. We just wanted a light breakfast of tea and perhaps toast and yogurt. We definitely are not the type to benefit from a 51-foot buffet! (In contrast we loved the Best Western in Lancaster, where we were served an above-average breakfast for free. But perhaps the 51-foot buffet is a good deal for those who could eat all that food and not gag. Beware if you're not into kitchy -- there's lots of garish gift shops along the stretch of highway near the hotel. We didn't find the prices that great for the stuff offered, but got a kick over it -- especially the one whose facade forms the shape of a gian mermaid. Food choices at restaurants are \"fat, fatter and fattest.\" You're not going to find a Whole Foods around here, or must else in the way of healthy food choices. There is a supermarket of sorts down the road, where we purchased fruits, light cheeses and crackers. Wish there was a place selling decent herbal teas. Dining out: So far, had one dinner at Black Angus - husband and dauther had NY Strip state (not the cheap - $10.00 -- house version which, we understand, is a tougher than shoe level, but the $17.99 12 oz. variety. I had chicken that sounded promising -- I supposed to be covered in sauteed spinach, but what I got was chicken breast topped with glopply cheese and specks of green tha I suppose were spinach flakes. I couldn't eat it. Also, mashed potatoes seemed to be from the box, so stick to rice of baked potato. I suspect all of the restaurants are in that category or in the false food category. If you plan to dine out or take a boat ride, or whatever, do ask the front desk for a coupon book. There are discount coupons everywhere except for the 'Disney Parks - which we' done and seen a few times aleady. Tonight we're going to see if we can order a pizza from on location Pizza Hut on site and ask for extra tomatoes and basei topping and NO cheese -- it's actually quite good and in eliminating the cheese, you're eliminating most of the fat. Hope this is helpful. Keeping our fingers crossed for tornado to pass as we have a 7 p.m. game to play, rain or shine. Things to do: If you're looking for a welcome reprieve from the whole Disney think (and we definitely are) taking an airboat ride out of Kissimmee is something we hope to squeeze in. We also thought we'd visit old town Kissimmee, which seems to have an old-time carnival atmosphere and shops, restaurants, etc. he beaches -- Daytna and Cocoa Beach -- are about 45-100 drive from here.

The room was excellent, they are either ground floor or 1st floor, ground floor is best as you can park your car outside your room, so best to ask for a ground floor room. The housekeeping was excellent. Clean towels etc each day, even on the days we had a lay in and didnt leave the room till the afternoon. Nice coffee maker with coffee and tea left each day. Fridge, tv, phone, hairdryer, iron, internet access. The only reason we didnt give this hotel an excellent rating is that on our arrival, after the usual long haul flight etc etc, we were not greeted well by the reception staff. Just a 'How was your trip' or such would have been nice, but no, just given room details, shown on a map of the hotel, and then directed to another receptionist who tried to get us to go to a time share meeting. I explained to her we had just travelled a long way and just wanted to go to our room and that in any case time share was the last thing we wanted to hear about. She was quite put out. We then had to find our own way to our room using the map. Why cant you be shown to your room much nicer and worth a tip ? During our 2 week stay we had nothing more to do with the hotel reception Our room maid was very friendly. My only other involvement with reception was when we checked out.

I remembered staying at the same hotel many years ago. When I searched for a hotel on the internet, I was looking for 3 things. 1- Rates of less than $55.00 a night, 2- Close proximity to Disney World and Hollywood Studios, and 3-A shuttle to the theme parks. I got the best room rate from using the Entertainment book. While I live in Jacksonville,Florida, this is the first time ( in more than 20 years) that I have driven further than 40 miles to a destination. We did not check in to our hotel until after 9 p.m. the first night. Our room was in building 10. I had no anxiety about the location of our room. I appreciate the fact that the room had a refrigerator. I brought breakfast cereal and disposable plastic cups with us from home and purchased a half-gallon of milk from the 24 hour Walgreens that was across the parking lot from the Hotel office. We did order a pepperoni pizza from the on-site Pizza Hut the first night, and we enjoyed it in our room. On to the room...the room was clean, and it cooled very quickly. It was somewhat musty, but I had packed a small 1.5 oz can of room spray from Bath and Body Works in anticipation of this. The room, bathroom, vanity, sink, tub, and toilet were all very clean. Be sure to close the bathroom door before you sit down though because the bathroom is small. However, I have experienced much smaller bathrooms in the U.K. and Venice, Italy. The towels and linens were the typical bleached white cotton. They were spotless. Horizontal surfaces were free from dust and grime. I did see some stains on the carpet, but my carpet at home has some stains on it too. I did not plan to sit or lie down on, or eat off of the carpet. Our housekeeper tidied our room each day. I never saw a tip envelope, so I never learned our housekeeper's name. We left her a tip the day we checked out. The young woman at the front desk told me that if you took the shuttle (earliest time was 9:15) to one Disney Park, you could catch a Disney bus to one of the other Disney Parks. This was useful information. We took advantage of this on the third day. Even though I had planned for us to use the shuttle for both days, we only used it for the long Disney day when we were there from 10-10. Bottom line- If you want a room that is clean, with cold a.c. , a bed to sleep in, and close proximity to the Disney parks, then stay at Best Western Lakeside. If you want posh, then stay somewhere else.", "Date": "November 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Widnes, Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cComfortable room, friendly, helpful staff.

I had stayed at this hotel in 2000 and my daughter stayed there with her dad in 2006. Even though the hotel has changed ownership a couple of times in this time period, everything was as I remembered, although the reception area and the rooms have had a lick of paint and a freshen up. The hotel is in the best possible area for access to Disney but it's only about a 20 minute drive to Universal and SeaWorld so well positioned for everything.The hotel does have shuttle buses to the attractions, but I was driving so we didn't need them. Very comfortable room with all the usual conveiniences. TV, fridge, coffee machine, iron and ironing board, hairdryer. Beds made up and clean towels every day, courtesy of our maid, Martha. Mary Lee on the reception desk made us feel very welcome on arrival and was very helpful when we couldn't get the safe to work, because the previous occupants had left it locked. There was non of the Time Share pressure that I had read about on previous reviews. She always seemed to be on duty and always gave a cheery wave when we passed by. She is a credit to the hotel. My daughter and I were travelling alone, which was quite daunting but we felt very relaxed and at ease. We did the parks, (boy did we do the parks!) but the crazy golf next door to the hotel was fun for a couple games too and the hotel games room was fun for a short while in the evenings. We didn't use the pools, although the pool areas looked in good order and the gardens were lovely. The choice of places to eat nearby is massive. We've got to recommend the Ponderosa because we've been eating there since we started going to Orlando 13 years ago. Even more so when Daniel, our waiter, remembered my daughter from last time she had visited! Brilliant.

We reported it to reception who phoned the police. A police officer came and went through the motions, dusting the door down for prints etc but he was most unhelpful and basically said we should be more careful, when we first arrived we found the door didn\u2019t shut properly so always made a point of slamming it!

Because there were no signs of any forced entry, the insurance company said we were not covered so we lost over \u00a32500 of stuff as both sets of house and car keys for back home were in there as well as our flight tickets (which cost us a further $1750 with Delta but that\u2019s another story). I also had some debit and credit cards in a purse in the case that I wasn\u2019t using on this holiday, they had been used at a gas station by 11am, just an hour and a half after we left our room.

Our flight had been delayed so it was already late when we arrived at the hotel, reception staff were friendly and even got security to drive us to our block as it was pouring down with rain and dark. Our room was on the 1st floor which we had requested in an attempt to avoid noisy people walking past. The only fault was that we seemed to have been placed in a room between 2 single sex groups who were on the landing late at night and even phoned our room in error 2 nights running, they left after a few nights but were unfortunately replaced by a basketball team of some sort who were bouncing their ball at all hours! This however cannot be helped in a hotel which caters for so many different groups. The rooms are basic with 2 queen sized beds, a fridge and safe, the hairdrier was broken and a guy came to fix it within minutes of reporting it. We ate breakfast in the hotel nearly every morning and only found it extremely busy on 1 occasion, the choice of food was excellent and the kids ate free. Kids also ate free in the bar/grill when staying as a Virgin holidaymaker and the free welcome cocktails went down a treat. There is also a pizza hut on site which came in very handy on some evenings. Staff at this hotel are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble, on our first night we were so tired and the guy had forgotton to put through our pizza order we didn't even complain and he still gave us a full refund with our fresh pizza !! Transportation however was more of an issue on this visit. We didn't hire a car and because we utilised the free transport last time didn't foresee any problems. However the transport is now shared between at least 2 other hotels and although our hotel is always the first pick up the journey home can sometimes be a squeeze if you end up at the back of the queue. This hotel is ideally located on the 192 and situated minutes away from the Disneyworld resort. There are so many restaurants nearby it was hard to chose.

Check-in was a breeze, but when we got to the room, the carpets we stained everywhere...seeing as we had our 2 yr old with us and I didn't want her crawling all over it, I called front desk and asked to be relocated. They did no problem and upgraded us to a poolside room for free (normally 10 dollars a night). The new room was better but still had a couple stains on the carpet. The room was fine...your basic hotel room. Not very modern, looks old and tired but does the trick. The hotel grounds were poorly maintained. The air conditioners from the room leaked all over our carpet. On 3 different occasions, we were locked out of our room because the swipe card wouldn't work...not so fun after a long day at the parks. The pools were nice, but when I went to buy a drink for my wife and I, the bartender would not accept out-of-country ID unless it was a passport. I didn't like that seeing as I don't carry around my passport to purchase alcohol. Speaking of which, there is a safe in the room to keep valuables. Our wasn't working at first so I called the desk and they set a security officer over to fix it, the next day it was broken again so we never got to use it. The maid would clean the room daily, but never vacummed. The TV in the room is old but seemed to have enough channels, however, we never watched it. The tub would not drain properly. After I bathed my daughter, it would take about 1 hr to drain. All in all, this hotel sucks...but it's a good price to pay if you want convenience (close to everything including the parks). Also, it appeared to be the best looking hotel on the strip.

Rooms look very tired and \"motel-ish\". If you ever traveled on an interstate highway (such as I-95), and stopped at a random motel for a night, you'd understand my \"motel-ish\" analogy. Everything looks as if the motel is 20+ years old; Staff is not very friendly, request a $10 surcharge for a king room or a room facing the pool (aside from the $3.50/day \"resort fee\"). Overall: If you are looking for an absolutely BASIC 2 star motel to sleep in-between parks, it may be a good value property for you. However, you will not feel comfortable at the hotel, as you would in practically any 3-star property. I would not recommend this property, and would suggest you book any other 3-star property, probably paying the same as you would for this motel.

Before I start I must say that this hotel offers value for money and is a good base for exploring Disney and Universal. If all you want is basic accomodation then this property is great, as you'll probably be out all day any way and spend minimum time at the hotel. The rooms are adequate, clean but rather small and dark. They have two small double beds, a large safe,, fridge, hair dryer, iron, coffee maker, free wifi and air con. The bathroom is rather small and basic but is sufficent. The maids do come every day, not sure how often the change the beds but they were always made when we came home from the parks. My major concern with the rooms were that they often over look a parking lot and this didnt make me feel very secure. There is no balcony just a window (which we always had the curtains closed for privacy as it overlooked the parking lot) hence why the room always felt dark. The hotel has three pools, which are ok, some days are quiet whilst others are noisey (depending on how many other people choose to have a relaxing pool day the same day as you). As a couple we found the pool areas a little too noisey but would be great for families and children. But we cant grumble as Florida is a family destination so we accept that. The pool areas seem tidy and clean but with little shaded areas, more parasols would have made a big difference. The pizza hut express on site is good and you can get pizza delivered to your room, eat in the restuarant or around the pool. The buffet breakfast is rubbish, there is a better and cheaper buffet breakfast across the main road on the right called the Golden Corral, has far more choice, fresher and cheaper. The location of the hotel is good; on site is a Wall Greens, you can buy anything you could possibly need from here. Also along the main road to the left is a Wendy, Mcdonalds, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and numerous other restuarants such as chinese and Indians as well as Steak houses and seafood buffets. An absolutely gorgeous steak house is called Key W Kools which is left on the main road. Right next door to the hotel is a great mini golf place, definately worth a go. There is also a pizza buffet called Ci Ci's next to the golf, which we never visited but wished we had as it looked lovely. The transport from the hotel to the theme parks was good but I would reccommend getting a car, we didnt but wished we had. The hotel puts on a shuttle to the following theme parks; Universal and Seaworld 7;45 return 6.00 Animal Kingdom 9;20 return 5;15 Magic Kingdom 9.50 and 5.15 return 520 0r 10;45 Hollywood studios (MGM) 11.30 return 8.30 Epcot- not sure what times as we didnt go Busch Gardens also departs daily at 940 returning around 9pm but needs to be booked through Mears travel. With regards to any of the disney parks, if you wanted to go to Hollywood studios a little earlier for example, you could get the 9.50 bus to Magic kingdom and then use the Disney free transport over to Hollywood studios, same with any of the others. Parking at the parks is $12, however taxis are expensive and if you want to return home from the parks earlier than the scheduled transport it would cost you; Magic kingdom- $30 Animal kingdom -$15 Seaworld- $35 Universal- $55 A car would you give you flexibility to come and go as you please and allow you to make most of the shopping malls. Also Universal City Walk and Down Town Disney are worth a avisit in the evening but this is difficult and expensive without a car. For Down Town Disney we cheated by getting the 5.15 shuttle to Magic Kingdom and then used the free disney transport to Down Town Disney. Again you can do the ame for your return journey and get the 10.45 shuttle back to the hotel from Magic Kingdom. Just a word of warning guest services at the hotel will offer you cheap Disney tickets if you attend a time share presentation for 2 hours. The money you would save is a matter of $70 which when you covert this to English money is hardly worth it. I recommend you buy your tickets before you come. Not sure how authentic the other outlets are that claim to sell cheap tickets as when you buy them from Disney you have to give a finger print scan when you enter the park, saw a few people get turned away looking rather angry and upset. Overall the hotel is a good location, good free transport but a little run down and shabby looking.

We realised that it wasn't the Hilton we were booking but have stayed at many Best Westerns in the UK and expected a similar good standard at 3.5 star. We were very disappointed from the time we arrived. It was clear that this was a basic motel and not a hotel as we had expected, full of the facilities for a family. The hotel lobby, restaurants, rooms and stairwells are very 'run down' and tired and it all desperately needs a good makeover. The crazy golf course was in dire need of repair. The pools, bar and the breakfast and breakfast waiters were the best things about the hotel. Our room was well cleaned but it was cramped and had a strange arrangement with part of the bathroom being curtained off. There was a problem with the free transport - no booking or queueing system - and people just turned up and barged their way onto the buses (some from other hotels). Due to this problem there was a punch up on Xmas Day in the 'queue' ! This was the only time the reception staff got involved, despite being told there were continual transport shortages.The poolside bar was closed until the day before we came home and apart from the bar and pizza hut there were no evening meals which we were expecting as a family friendly hotel, as the restaurant was closed. One of the aspects that worried us the most with young children was the openess of the hotel or motel as it actually was. The stairwells were very grotty and dirty and were open to the car parks - there was no security to stop children from leaving or undesirables from coming up to your bedroom door. Sorry for going on, but I wouldn't have gone if I had read this sort of review before I booked. I am very surprised that Virgin have kept this 'hotel' on, and it has put me off booking Virgin again if that was supposed to be a 3.5 star. It may be ok for singles/couples who are travelling, but I would strongly recommend families to go elsewhere", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, spacious room, lots of plus points.

When I read the mixed reviews I was slightly apprehensive, but really didn't need to be! Hotel is great. Is definitely more of a motel, but we found this a bonus as it meant you were more independent and didn't need to pass the Guest Services every time you left the building! Beware, as other reviewers have noted - Guest Services purely want to sell a time share to you. They will dress it up by saying they can offer cheap Disney/universal tickets. However, there is actually a representative in each morning to sell these tickets and as soon as you decline interest in the time share, Guest Services have nothing else to offer! We requested an upstairs room, to limit noise from above, and this was a good move. The ground floor rooms are a bit noisier, as there are lots of kids running about and the pool is close by, dependent on the building you are put in. Room was spacious, air conditioning a god send, cleaner in every day keeping the place very tidy. We decided to do it without a car, and this worked out OK. There are shuttles running to each Disney park every day, though there is usually only one shuttle going to and from the park per day. Earliest pick up is 9 for disney parks and 7.45am for Universal/Sea World. Pick ups are from 5pm onwards, so there is no chance of returning to the hotel during the hot part of the day, unless you take a taxi. We found some days quite long, but manageable. The Disney internal shuttle is handy as it means you can transfer to different parks/Downtown Disney with no cost. If you are going to Downtown Disney, you have to take a bus to one of the Disney resorts then get a bus to Downtown Disney/Typhoon Lagoon. We used Pop Century Resort from Hollywood Studios. Also, we fancied going to Florida Mall, but never got round to it. We did notice however, on our last day, that there's a Lynx bus goes from Magic Kingdom to Florida Mall, so you could get a shuttle there if you really wanted to go to the mall. I think the number for the Lynx was 111. There is a bus to Busch Gardens that can pick you up at the hotel. This costs $10 each and will be arranged by the hotel, if you buy your tickets there. However, I think the Flex ticket is pretty good value and you can buy that online before you go. The free shuttle the hotel offers to the Lake Buena Vista factory outlets is well worth it. You get a lot of discount coupons. I spent a fortune in Gap, Aeropostale and the Nine West outlet! If you like clothes/shoes, go here! Restaurants in the area are pretty good - there is an Outback Steakhouse, TGI Fridays and supermarket across the main road, and several fast food places on the same side of the road as the hotel. The breakfast buffet is OK and if you are planning on being out for the day, is good value as it means you may not need to buy lunch in the park. Pools at the hotel were great - clean and cool, after a long day at a theme park! There are poolside bars and happy hours between 12-2 pm and 5-7 pm. These are all points that I would've liked clarified before I went. Hope my pointers help you! If you want nightlife, I would definetely hire a car though, unless you have lots to spend on taxis or are happy with the hotel bar!", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, Does exactly what it says on the tin.\u201d", "Author": "andyrae1971", "ReviewID": "UR36020601", "Content": "Really nice hotel, nothing fancy but clean and the staff were friendly. well placed for all that orlando has to offer.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fife", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, fantastic location, lovely staff, great rooms\u201d", "Author": "nikkibabes27", "ReviewID": "UR35943416", "Content": "First off, I really don't understand how people can fault this place, if you want the Ritz go to the Ritz.

There is an onsite pizza hut (good value for money), three swimming pools, mini golf, laundry room, games room, restraunt and bar, internet, wallgreens in the car park(expensive but has everything you need), tons of restraunts within walking distance - red lobster, CiCi's, Taco Bell etc. The staff are all very helpful, but like some others have said stay away from the ticket seller, you will be guided here once you have checked in, but just smile politely and refuse there free offers of money and tickets - it will save you two hours of your holiday. The Restraunt on site Hurricane Sam's is excellent although can be a little pricey, however the waistress always has a smile and some banter for you. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Again like others have mentioned the beds are on the small time, but take one each if two of you and you have plenty room. There is a great sized fridge, television, safe, hairdryer, coffee machine (great little gizmo), iron and air conditioning(on the noisy side but works a treat). The grounds of the hotel are well kept and look good. There are a couple of gripes. We were in building 7 which backs onto the noisy laundry unit so we could hear the industrial washing machines and drier throughout the night however it was not a major issue. The water pressure of the hand basin tap was a trickle but again not a major problem. So not really a gripe just a few annoyances. Please do not hesitate in booking this motel, it has everything you need for a trip to florida to visit the parks and see the sites.

Our room was upstairs and had two double beds in it even though there was only two of us. Really spacious too. Really big safe and working fridge/television/shower was really warm and controlable. The location in proximity of disneyworld parks is brilliant. To be truthfull they are 10-15 minutes away by car. My advice is to hire a car. There is every conceivable eatery in this area except KFC. We went to Golden Corrall quite a few times as they had a buffet style bar and must of had about 100 different types of foods. Most edible but not all depending on tastes. There are lots of local shops near the hotel selling towels and fancy goods etc. Petrol is cheap too compared to UK. Overall the holiday was exceptional, of course an holiday is what you make it but on this one I couldn't find fault or critiscism.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cFound no fault\u201d", "Author": "Elvislover57", "ReviewID": "UR34045604", "Content": "Myself and my husband had a 2 week stay and found it great.

My family stayed at the Best Western Hotel back in August 2008 and I reported on one element of the hotel\u2019s complimentary services - the shuttle service. Here is my report again for those who missed it! - Before I begin I would like to say the times etc given are based on August 2008 and may have changed sinced You will have heard both good reports and bad reports of this service, and I will have to say it would be easier if you had an hired car\u2026.but as I am one of those people who wanted to let someone else do the driving, and not worry about tackling the roads in Florida and to save some money from the additional costs of a hired car like insurance, petrol and tolls etc. For those who are not aware, the cost of parking your car at Disney is $12 a day! Therefore within the two weeks I took full advantage of the hotel free shuttle service and the public transportation system, and I thought I would share my discoveries with you. Visits to Disney\u2026 The hotel schedules shows trips from the hotel to Animal Kingdom (9.15am), Magic Kingdom (9.50am), Hollywood Studios and Epcot (11am) and Magic Kingdom (5.30pm). Then the bus returns from the Magic Kingdom (5.45pm & 10.30pm), Epcot (6.00pm & 8.45pm), Animal Kingdom (6.15pm) and Hollywood Studios (8.30pm). Once you arrive at a Disney park, you can easily take the Walt Disney Transportation system to the other parks\u2026.so you don\u2019t need to wait until 11am to get to Epcot, just catch the 9.15am to Animal Kingdom and take the Disney bus to Epcot arriving at the park at around ten. The same applies to the return journey, if you want to leave a Disney park at 5.30pm make your way to the Disney\u2019s ticket and transportation centre (outside Magic Kingdom) to pick up the shuttle. To get to Disney\u2019s water parks or Downtown Disney, it can be a little bit more complicated as there are no direct Disney buses from either of the four theme parks. The way around this is to go to the Disney Park as normal, and then get a Disney bus to one of their hotel resorts. For example, to get to Blizzard Beach, we took the 9.15am bus to Animal Kingdom and then we caught the Disney bus to Disney\u2019s All Stars Resort, and from there we took the bus to the water park. One last thing to mention, and that concerns the taxis. We left the parks early on a couple of days to spent the afternoon at the hotel before catching the 5.30pm shuttle back to the park. If you want to return to the hotel by using a taxi during the day, I recommend you take a Disney Bus to Animal Kingdom and go from there. Animal Kingdom is the nearest park to the Best Western Lakeside and the cost was under $10. I believe the cost from Magic Kingdom is $24. Visits to Universal Studios and Sea World. The hotel schedule shows trips from the hotel to Sea World and Universal Studios is 7.45am, returning at 7.30pm (Universal) or 7.45pm (Sea World). This is going to be a long day\u2026as the parks do not usually open until 9am and so you have to wait for up to an hour before the park opens. Some families found the days too long, especially the day at Sea World (With Universal you can spend a hour or two walking around Universal\u2019s City Walk, which is like Downtown Disney). At Sea World if you want to return early, I would recommend you go across the car park to the Renaissance Resort and go to the bus stop marked \u201832\u2019 on the same side as the hotel. A local Lynx bus comes every 30 minutes (No 50) which will take you back to the Disney\u2019s ticket and transportation centre (Magic Kingdom). The price of the bus is a couple of dollars. If you arrive before 5.45pm, you can catch the free shuttle back to the hotel, or if you arrive after this time, take a Disney bus to Animal Kingdom and catch the taxi. If you want to take the local bus from Sea World to Best Western Lakeside, you will need the No 50 to Magic Kingdom, then the No 56 to Kissimmee Old Town and then the No 55 from the Old Town to the hotel\u2026.this will take a while! Visit to Busch Gardens Tampa. This year we went to Busch Gardens. For this we used the \u2018Busch Gardens Shuttle Express\u2019 which is a daily round trip transportation direct from the Best Western Lakeside. The cost of this service is only $10 per person (free for 5-park flex ticket holder). You just call 1-800-221-1339 a couple of days before you depart to reserve a space on the bus. The bus will come to Best Western Lakeside at 9.40am and collect you. You arrive at the park at approximately 11am. The bus leaves Busch Gardens at 7pm (depending on the park closure times) and returns to the hotel. Visits to Shops. Best Western Lakeside offers a complimentary shopping shuttle to Lake Buena Vista Factory Stores, which is a nice little trip. However, this year we wanted to take advantage of exploring the famous international drive with the various shops associated with this. We took the 7.45pm shuttle to Sea World. From here, you can get onto the I-Ride Trolley, this is a bus which takes you up and down the miles that make up the International Drive Resort Area. We used the \u2018main line\u2019 and when paying you must have the exact money on you. The cost is $1 per person per ride. Most shops open at 10am, so you may want to get a coffee somewhere before tackling the shops. We had a \u2018all you can eat breakfast\u2019 at Slizzers on stop \u201824\u2019. The shopping centres I would recommend to you are at stop \u20181\u2019 Prime Outlets International, stop \u20182\u2019 Festival Bay Mall and stop \u201841\u2019 Orlando Premium Outlets\u2019. Once again if you want to get back to Best Western Lakeside during the afternoon, just catch the Lynx 50 bus from stop \u201832\u2019 to Magic Kingdom. One thing I feel I have to mention is the I-trolley bus is advertised as arriving approximately every 20 minutes. At one part of the day (it was a Saturday) it took 45 minutes of waiting in the hot heat for the bus to come and then there was heavy traffic causing a delay in getting back to Sea World. If we had a car it would have taken us 30 minutes to get back to the hotel. That afternoon it took almost three hours! However a couple of days later we used the I-Trolley and it was fine.

If you want to go to Down Town Disney just use the shuttle to get to Magic Kingdom then hop onto one of Disneys free shuttles to get you there. You don't need parki hoppers to utilise the free transport so just use the hotel bus then hop around as you wish. We didn't have a car and taxis were expensive so we relied on the buses. Tip if you have tickets for Busch Gardens arrange a couple of days before transport to pick you up, reception will do this for you and they pick you up the same place you get the shuttles. We didn't know this and ended up going to Aquatica instead! Rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels were given if required. We did eat a coupl of times on site and the food was ok, nothing to rave about but if you like Pizza Hut then your laughing as there is one on site. Near to the hotel and within walking distance are loads of eaterias, best we found was Red Lobster and a nearby Steak house, my sons favourite Crabby Bills! Think we put on a stone or 2!

We got a package at $490 CAD for flight, hotel & car rental for 7 days so it was a sick deal. When we got to the hotel, we had no issues checking in, they gave us the option of upgrading to a king-size bed with a pool view for $10 extra per night, but we declined. They also gave us the option of the top floor or bottom, we chose top so we wouldn't hear anyone above us. I have no complaints about the hotel room - it was clean, the beds were kind of small to share with someone, but for a week, it was easy to live with (and there were 2 beds, so you can have your own if you're just 2). There were no loud noises to speak of, I didn't have trouble sleeping at all. The only thing I would improve is the water pressure - kind of weak but not a huge deal. Maybe it was just our room. The fridge worked, the AC worked great, there is free high-speed internet but it's not wireless - they provide a cable in the room. I suggest if you have a laptop to bring it. It's useful for planning your days and getting info quick & easy. The reception has computers you can use but it's way more convenient to have access in your own room instead of having to leave & go all the way to the front desk. The fridge was great - we bought about $100 worth of breakfast & lunch food in order to save some $$. There is a supermarket really close to the hotel, in the same complex at Giordano's. We ate supper out every night, our food budget was $400 and it was perfect. We did eat at the breakfast buffet once at the hotel but it wasn't anything special, don't waste your money there. There is also a safe in the room which was very convenient and we had no issue with. It's digital - when you arrive you create your own code. There is an exercise room but, um, I didn't make it there! So I can't comment on the facilities. We went to the pool a few times & the poolside bar is convenient but the bartender made us show him our passports to prove our age, which we thought was really unnecessary & weren't very impressed with. The Walgreen's next door is awesome, I bought many of my toiletries there upon our arrival to save room in my luggage. We got our coffee at the 7-11 near the hotel every morning, very good coffee - better than Starbucks. Our vacation wasn't a Disney one, we stayed at the hotel but had a car and did a wide variety of activities - zipline, airboat ride, a day of bass fishing. We went to Silver Springs (great time) and Gatorland. We got tickets for $70 each for 1 day at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure - it was worth it. If you are interested in bass fishing, our guide, Kenny, was AWESOME, we were so pleased with our day - you can contact him at kenny@boatclub.com to book a day.

She told us that the usual prices were 56 dollars each and that if we took a visit to a local \" sister hotel\" for a possible future hotel to stay and that we would be given a lavish breakfast we could have the tickets for 40 dollars total..... sounds good we thought. Bad idea! I would strongly suggest you dont make the same mistake..... its a big hoax, sure you do get the tickets if you attend but it is a time share sales pitch. We were given a terrible breakfast, not good image for the mystic dunes straight away, and then given a tour of the hotel which of course they took us to the pent house etc.... Back from the tour she tried selling us timeshare which is around 7000 dollars deposit! and a further 27000 or so dollars to be paid off monthly... a terribly stupid idea plus it is a fortune to have the hotel maintained which they forgot to say about..... we obviously said no but number two sales man came to the desk who was a big man from newcastle who tried to give the deposit after a lot of us saying no for a dollar! they are obviously desperate for a sell.... he was exteremly rude and i cant explain how pushy he was, we still sat strong and said no no no, i was getting very annoyed by now and he went and along came number three!! to which we said no just sign the reciept so we can get the dinner show tickets... again very very rude man. sure enough we got the tickets and enjoyed the show however they are only in our eyes worth 40 dollars total anyway becuse everyone is asked at the end of the show to give 10 dollar tip each! That was the bad bit, again dont do it, unless you want to lose about 5 hours of your holiday! The hotel was clean, rooms cleaned everyday, pools nice and the lake very relaxing....look out for gators was quite fascinating...

It has fresh fruits, hot and cold cereals, scramble eggs, eggs made to orders, assorted breads and pastries, breakfast pizza, sausage, potatoes, french toast, pancakes. It includes coffee, tea, milk, but not the juice (you will have to pay extra). Breakfast is from 7AM- 11:30AM which I found nice. We didn't use the transportation which they offer, since it is not good. Shuttles have a very strict schedule, and you must be at the stop 10 minutes before departure. Like the last bus to depart from MK is at 10:45PM from the ticket center. If park closes at 10PM, with the long lines to take the Monorail, to take the tram to the ticket center, you'll miss the bus. If the park closes at midnight, the shuttles departs at 11:45PM, so, you'll miss the fireworks. Yes, rent a car if you are staying at this hotel. Check the hotel website for details on the shuttles if you want to take the risk to try it. Customer Service is very fast by email. Hotel is very close to the parks. It takes like 10 minutes to get to the entrance of MK. Less for the other Disney parks, more to non-Disney parks. It is located in an area with plenty of restaurants. Just drive east and you will find a lot of places to eat. It has a 24 hr pharmacy next door (Walgreens)-within walking distance.

First of all, when this hotel was booked (3 months prior to the vacation) I was told that renting a car wouldnt be necessary since the hotel provided compliementary shuttle drops and pick ups to Disney. Since we were also going to Universal I had to purchase transfers in advance with another company in order to secure a ride to the park. We checked in around 1230 and automatically asked when the next shuttle was heading to Disney World so we could get started as soon as possible. The next shuttle was not schedule to leave until 500pm and would pick up at 830pm. We were told that if we wanted to go early that they would call us a cab. After getting our bags to the room, located on the very back of the propery, we decided to go ahead and have them call a cab for us. The cost to take us to Animal Kingdom was $15 through the checker cab that was dispatched for us. Animal Kingdom closed at 5 so we rode one of the Disney buses to Hollywood Studios in order to catch the Fantasmic show at 9pm. The last shuttle leaving Hollywood Studios was at 8:45 so we had to take another cab back to the hotel this time it was $25. The next day was scheduled for Downtown Disney as we had reservations to the T-Rex resturant for lunch. There was no shuttle that would take us directly to the location we needed and didnt have enough time to chance the lines for the buses at the Disney Parks. Once again we had to take a cab. This is the part I find VERY interesting.. The hotel allows only one \"transportation\" company to shuttle their guests and allows cab drivers from the company to sit in the lobby waiting for guests who missed the shuttle or need to be taken else where. I knew, based on the previous day's experience/'expense, that checker cab was cheaper to take and requested a cab to be called. I was told since the company had men on site that they would have to take me and the hotel could not call a different company for me. I asked how much it would cost for us to go to Downtown Disney and I was told that it would be $30. At that point we decided to be late and just take a the bus from Animal Kingdom and asked the driver to take us there instead. He said that he would have to charge me an additonal $20 for the gate pass he had to purchase in order to drop us off at the guest drop off location. He began driving and talking toward our destination. I thought he was speaking to me and asked if he could please repeat and he got upset becuase he was talking on his bluetooth. He never hung up the call and took us to Downtown Disney anyway, charging us the $30 fare. The return trip cost $18 with the checker cab we found. One other review I read spoke about a man pushing a time share tour on them while they were guests. This also happened to us and we signed up only for free ride to the park since we'd already paid so much in cab fares as it was. The next morning we were to be picked up at 930am and taken to the resort for a complimentary breakfast and a short tour. The same \"transportation\" company was supposed to pick us up but they were running late (go figure) when we checked in w/ guest services on where the car was. 10:10 the driver finally shows up and takes us to the resort. and told us to check in at the desk inside. The line at the desk was literally out the door and my son was starving since he hadnt eaten breakfast yet. We were told that we would have to stand in line and check in prior to him being able to eat. We stood there for 15 minutes and none of the lines moved. We left shortly after so we could feed our child breakfast and just went straight to the park which did turn out to be a free car ride to Magic Kingdom but the driver spoke on the phone the entire time and ran a red light while turning left. Hoping to catch the complientary shuttle at 1045pm (the earliest shuttle after the 9:00 fireworks show) we took our time and enjoyed the park. At 7:30 it started pouring rain and my son was shivering. We'd never make it back to the pick up location in time to catch the 745 shuttle since everyone was leaving at the same time. There was not another shuttle available until 9:30. Stuck in the rain, child shivering cold there was no way that we could wait another 2 hours so, once again, had to take a cab. The next morning would begin our time at Universal and the shuttle passes that were purchased in advance were wonderful. All I had to do was call them an hour prior to pick up and they were there waiting, as a shuttle service should be. Most of my frustration with this hotel was based around the shuttle services but the rooms were not very clean and when the maid did come to straighten up didnt do much. The beds were uncomfortable and had a flat sheet drapped (not tucked) across the bed for a fitted sheet. The water pressure in the shower was so weak that you had to check if the water was still running. There were people in our building that would party late into the evening and were very, very loud drunks. I will NEVER stay at another Best Western hotel again just based on this experience and will ask that if anyone is planning on staying here to please reconsider.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire,", "Title": "\u201cGood value clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "gilmourrachel", "ReviewID": "UR30839094", "Content": "We booked through Virgin and reading through other reviews before we left, I tried to change this hotel, but to no avail, so off we went in search of dirty rooms and bed bugs.

The hotel is in a great location,with plenty of restaurants around and a super market across the road which was cheaper than a lot of other supermarkets we went too.Right by the Hotel is a Walgreens which my wife seemed to spend a lot of her time in for some reason or another! There is a resort fee at this hotel of $3.50 a night per room,which although is,nt expensive i still wonder what we actually got out of this.When we checked in the receptionist explained this was for local phone calls and also for the shuttle buses to the theme parks.Firstly we didnt make any local calls and as we had a car never used the shuttle.When i looked at the leaflet they gave us which had the shuttle times on it i dont think i would have bothered using it,if you wanted to go to Universal for eg,you could get the shuttle at 7.45 am but the last one was 6.00pm,so that would mean an early finnish at the theme park and no time for Universal city! However my main gripe about this hotel are the guys at reception who try to get you to go to time share presentations.There always seemed to be 4 people at reception,the 2 guys to the left are ok but the 2 to the right are a pain!We first encountered this on our first night,we enquired about tickets for Universal.The guy told us they would cost us an arm and a leg and wrote down the figure of $240,then he started writing down all sorts of figures,we both hadnt got a clue what he was doing but then he told us he could do us 2 tickets for half price and do us an even better deal if we wanted tickets for both parks.This would have meant a two and a half hour presentation,we were only in Florida for 5 nights and i didnt fancy wasting time!Even when we checked out one of these guys called across and asked us if we wanted cheap tickets for one of the parks.I told him we were on our way back to Atlanta,but still he persevered with we can give you $80 back on the price of the hotel and then even that we could stay a night for free at the resort(Which name escapes me)which they are trying to sell you.

I booked this hotel last summer and have been reading the reviews regularly since then to make sure I hadn't made a mistake in booking here. First, I'll comment on the negative points to our stay. Upon walking in the bathroom the first time, we discovered several dried urine spots on the toilet seat. Yuk! I cannot imagine how housekeeping missed this! I immediately called the front desk and reported the problem. They sent someone to clean it in less than five minutes. Not 15 minutes later we discovered the sink drain was broken. Again, another call to the front desk. They said they would send maintenance. We left to go to one of the theme parks and the sink was repaired while we were gone so that really wasn't a big deal. Now, the single worst thing about staying here: the beds. They are literally hard as a slab of stone. Only Fred and Wilma Flintstone would find these beds comfortable. We would wake up in the morning stiff and hardly able to move. The only other thing I had to complain about was a bunch of rowdy teenagers in the pool way past the pool's closing time. They were yelling and screaming so loudly, you could hear them over the air conditioner (which is loud). I really tried to deal with it, but as long as they were yelling and carrying on, there would be no sleep. I finally calledl the front desk and asked them to send someone to quiet them down. Fifteen minutes later, nobody had showed up. Yet another call to the front desk. After telling them that they could either take care of the problem or I would expect a discount on my stay, they promptly sent somebody to clear out the pool. The rest of our stay, everybody had cleared out of the pool by 11:00 so that was no longer an issue. Now, the positives. The single best thing about staying here is the location. You can't beat it. It is close to everything! It is located on a busy, very touristy stretch of Irlo Bronson Highway. Lots of restaurants, gift stores, etc. line both sides of the roadway. Animal Kingdom is literally 3 minutes away if you use Sherberth Road (assuming you don't catch the stop light at that intersection). All the staff I encountered was friendly. We checked in at 2:30 (posted check-in time is 3:00) and there was no line whatsoever. We paid $477.12 including taxes and the mandatory $3.50/day resort fee for eight nights. You can't beat that. There are flea bag type hotels in this area that cost more than that. This property IS an older property, but great care has been taken to keep it up.

We asked for a quiet room and we received one on the 2nd floor, in building 4, facing the parking lot. We were very pleased with the room. It was cleaned well daily. Building 4 was right next to the miniature golf, playground, large pool and tiki bar. If you walk across the pool you'll be right into the building where the front desk is, not much walking at all. We planned on being at the parks 5 days, and splashing around the pool the other 5 days. My husband and 5 year old love pools. However it didn't work out as we planned. We arrived on Friday, spent Saturday at MK, Sunday we spent at the pool, and Monday went to AK. By late afternoon we noticed our 5 yr old might be comming down with a cold and late Monday night we noticed that our 5 year old had developed a pink eye. That fricked me out. We called the front desk and asked for advice. They gave us a number for 24 hr doctor assistance where the doctor comes to your room. The nurse told us what to do to wait it out till morning when the office opened, or receive a doctor's visit at 3 am. Since our 5 year old never complained of any pain, plus was already asleep, we decided to not do anything till the morning. Walgreens, which was right next door to Best Western, had a care center. We took her there at 8 am, when it opened, and a very nice nurse gave us a prescription for the pink eye and advised us to not do anything for 24 hrs, because our 5 yearl old could be contagious. The care center took our insurance and we only paid our $15 copay. Without the insurance the visit would've cost $75 which would not have been a big deal. We stayed in our room all day on Tusday till the following morning, than decided to go to Sea World. We also spent the rest of the vacation going back to the parks. We did not use the pool again, a little disapointed about that, but neverless had so much fun at the parks. We also played the miniature golf a few times, and our 5 year old really enjoyed it. The playground was also used several times, and we once ate at the buffet breakfast, which I was not very pleased with. Not many choices.

I, like you are doing right now looked over reviews of hotels before heading to Disney. This was by far the cheapest motel I could find with the best reviews. Most of the reviews seemed overall positive with some negative mixed in. Upon checking in I was greeted with a decent sized line. There was 3 people working the front desk, but with 500+ rooms and coming in around check in time it was obviously the busy part of the day. The front desk gentleman who checked me in seemed a bit disinterested. I booked using my AAA discount, he of course asked for the card upon checking in...I showed it to him and he saw the expiration date of April 1st and immediately returned it and said my membership was expired, I then had to show him the expiration date of 2010. I was given room 617 in building 14. I didn't realize how huge this property was....I believe it had around 15 buildings in total and even tho the gentleman at the front desk gave me a map and showed me exactly where my room was I still got lost. The location was good, we got a 2nd floor room with a view of the pool. If you have a choice definitely take the pool view, its the only good view you will find unless you prefer a view of the fence or parking lot. I felt very safe at this location which is always something I look for in reviews...the parking lot is very well lit. Be prepared to have to search for a parking place if you get back to the motel late at night. We got back at 1am one night and had to park really far away from our room. The room was very basic. We weren't planning on being in the room very much since the whole purpose was to go to Disney. But even with that being said, I didn't care for the room at all. We had stains on the carpet, the beds were hard as a rock and small which I guess I should've expected since we had 2 double beds. We found 2 bugs in each of the beds, which from what I hear may not be surprising with Florida but it wasn't comforting to find bugs crawling around the bed. The bathroom was very small and almost uncomfortable to be in and the toilet got clogged up a few times. Housekeeping didn't service the room the first 2 days of our stay...finally on day 3 we did come back to find it cleaned, altho it looked like they were in a hurry and missed a few things. The TV only had 28 channels on it, which wasn't a big problem since we weren't in the room much but did take note of it. We did use the wireless internet which was excellent, the only thing I found I had to do was sit near the window because the signal strength wasn't the greatest. We didn't take advantage of the pool but like I said we had a pool view and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It was never that crowded either so don't worry about that. The best thing about the motel was the location. It was very easy to get to Disney from the motel. In fact one day I made note that from the time we walked out the motel door, til the time we parked the car at Disney and got on the tram only 20 minutes had elapsed which was a huge plus. This hotel has to be the best bargain in the area...like I said earlier I used my AAA discount and paid a total of $219 for 3 nights including tax and everything. Overall would I stay here again? Probably not. I didn't find the motel rooms to be that clean. But some people might not mind it for the price and other factors. With the age of the motel and the amount of guests that come to this motel I'm sure management does the best they can with everything.

The only trouble with this place is that you have to order your main course first and put the buffet on the same plate but by the time your meal comes to you, you are too pogged to eat it. Back to the Hotel. There is a great bar where you can grab a drink and a bite. The bar is Hurricane Sams. The Bar staff was a little arrogant but you can't have it all i suppose. Becare in the foyers. There's loads of sales staff trying to sell time share. If you have time to kill. Go to a presentation for about 90mins, then say you are skint and in recession and they will then give you free tickets to theme parks or dinner show tickets.

Richard is the nicest person in the world. Made us feel so welcome. The onsite pizza hut was ok. cisi's pizza was great! $5.99 for all you can eat buffet of pizza, pasta, salad and pudding. If you wanted a takeaway pizza it was $3.99 instead of paying $15 in pizza hut at the hotel. We never went to the virgin welcome meeting. We only found out from next door that virgin customers get a free daily mail paper everyday and they get a meal voucher for somewhere in citywalk in universal. The shuttle buses to the park were good. There was one driver who liked the lion king, he was brilliant and lovely.

My 10 year old daughter and I stayed here from December 3rd through the 15th. This was our 3rd trip to Orlando together and I've stayed at many off property hotels. This is above and beyond the rest! The rooms are very spacious, well lit and clean! I booked this online and got a very reasonable rate ($54/night). Before we arrived, I contacted the hotel to give our preferences (1st floor, as I do not manage stairs very well, 2 double beds and as close to the bus stop as possible, as we were not renting a car and relying on the hotel shuttles to get us where we want to go.) Every single one of my requests were granted and we were put into room 101! Perfect room, perfect location for us! The pool was around the corner, as was the game room and restaurant!!! I couldn't have been more pleased! By all means, go to the restaurant for breakfast. The most wonderful staff will take care of you. Hats off to Zack, Ana, John and Britney! We already miss you guys so much! The first day my daughter wanted \"Mickey\" pancakes and Ana went back to the cook to ask for them and he did it for her!!! That was above and beyond good service. We also were able to get a \"kid's size\" portion of the spaghetti dinner at the little store. It was not on the menu, but when we asked, they said no problem! That's good service! As most of the other reviewers said having Walgreen's right there was wonderful for sodas & snacks. My only inconvenience was with the shuttle system ---- it doesn't run often enough and you do miss out on some of the late night activities at the park, such as Illuminations and the Very Merry Christmas party. It also does not leave early enough so that you are there when the park opens. There is a Lynx stop (Bus 55) across the road but I still don't know if it runs north, south, east or west. If you can figure that one out, you'll be ok. Make sure you have the correct change to take the bus! Once you do get to one of the parks, you can use the Disney Transportation system for any other Disney park/hotel. Many restaurants within walking distance and our personal favorite was the Golden Corral. I swear we ate there about 5 times! The lunch buffet is less expensive and they start serving the dinner buffet (including steak) at 4pm, so if you are in there before 4pm, you pay the lunch price and can eat steak after 4pm. Delicious! Fred, the steak chef, was a riot!!! We loved him! OH, and we even got to see little geckos hanging around the pool sunning themselves!

There is a much better one in front of the hotel and across the street that is not free! The room was recently updated with new fixtures and furniture, the AC/heat unit was new and quiet and the maid service was excellent. The room was cleaned very well every night that we were there and the beds were acceptable. As I said in my last review, the location is great, you don\u2019t have to get onto Route 4 and battle the traffic to get to the Disney Parks. The exit is about 2 miles from the hotel. If you prefer there is a free shuttle service to the parks. The only drawback I found with the shuttle service was on the return trip, multiple stops and a lengthy wait for the bus at the return pickup point. There are a few Restaurants across the street in walking distance. Outback, Red Lobster, Chinese and an Italian Restaurant.

Did not want to spend a lot of money, so I went online and got a car/hotel package deal. Total price for both $77. The hotel was the Best Western Lakeside, in Kissimmee, FL. It is located on a major hotel road, Irlo Bronson Hwy. Physical proximity to the entrance to DisneyWorld is about 5 minutes and about 15 minutes for Universal Studios. With the great price that I got, I was surprisingly pleased how nice the hotel was. No, it is not fancy, all hotel room doors face the outside. However, the quality of the rooms and the sense that it has been updated makes a good impression and 'value' comes to mind. The check-in was painless, the staff was nice and there was plenty of free parking. The 2nd floor room was modern enough and the beds were fine. The bathroom appeared to be updated and the curtains were in good condition. The room also has a safe in it for valuable, which comes in handy. If I had paid $77 for the room itself I would have thought I had gotten a good deal. However, getting it and a nice little compact car for $77, well, that is a great deal. For a single person, couple or family, who wants to enjoy the Orlando area without spending a ton of cash, I would say the Best Western Lake was definitely a good bargain.

What we did not expect to find was that the Best Western was as good as 4 star resorts we have previously stayed in. My main priority was to have internet access, the staff put uin block 14 over looking a garden, quite and close to the laundry (the cleanest i have ever encountered), and next to a tiny gym, nothing to write about here, but able to get your hearrate up and lift some weights, still it is there if you work out and is fine. Free wi fi if you have your own laptop! could not believe that, Secondly , there is a free safe included with the room, 1st time for that too! so your valuables (big enough to put computer in), daily maid service, Brand new shower curtains and lovely clean bathrooms( small), built in clothes line in the shower handy for washing underwear and drying, great size rooms and good tv selections, bring clothes hangers as i always do any way , and own toiletries. we go to target and buy a $20 electric kettle and instant coffee for good hot coffee in the mornings, but is a tiny coffee maker, fridge is a decent size, 3 shelves, we also go to walmart and buy a $6 cooler and keep topped up with free ice from the end of our block and keep our sodas/beer in it instead of taking up fridge space. air con great, but the best thing is as we love fresh air and most hotels in the states you can't even open a window, here it is quite and we leave the door open to the outside, no inside corridors, and even though we are smokers, who NEVER smoke inside, it is great to have a nice smelling room, and we simply step outside to smoke. so booking on the side of the road was the best thing we had ever done! we are not here for disney, but had read other reviews about time share things, we haven't encountered any thing like that at all. hope this helps", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNice n Easy accomodation\u201d", "Author": "brits", "ReviewID": "UR20931838", "Content": "We stayed here at the B W Lakeside from the 30th Sept - 13th Oct.

A few parasols and table n chair's Pizza Hut - Handy for a snack Restaurant - Was not open when we walked past - don't know if we missed the opening times but, it was not a problem to us as meals were served in the bar. Bar - Open after T time - Richard the barman is brilliant. Food we had in there was fine. Reception - Staff OK but not outstanding. Internet - We bought a plastic card for $20 and used that as and when we needed to - about 8 PC's to use and a printer. Car Hire - Office within the Lobby. Walgreen's right in front of the hotel. Kathy - Is the lady who tries to get you to go to the Condo viewing - she is very nice but veryyyyyyy full on! Just say No thanks and walk or you will be there foreverrrrrrrrrr :) Tranportaion to the Park's but we did not use it. Kid's play area on sand behind the pool fence. Crazy Golf - FREE - We paid $11 pp at the CG near to Winn Dixie - at CC's pizza I think it is $12 and you get a meal with the game - We live n learn!!!! Link bus route is on the main road, a two minute walk from the Lobby - cross the road and wait for the bus there and it will take you to the WalMart - bargain's galore and a Liquor section. We liked the laid back time we had here at the BWL - being able to eat n drink around the pool, unlike Spain etc where you are expected to NOT able to bring even your own water around some self catering pools!!!! We had breakfast buffet's at Golden Corral and Pondarosa - prefer GC and it is just a 10 min walk. Had a normal size breakfast at the Cracker Barrel - 10 min walk to the left as you come out of the hotel, a nice shop section here for some \"american\" type gifts etc. The room's at the BWL are being refurbished - this did not intrude on our holiday at all.

The beds were carelessly made (sheets not tucked in), the bath had mold on and under the caulking, the toilet was so temperamental that it made you fearful to use it. The water would not go beyond lukewarm for either cold or hot. It had a unhygienic feel to the whole place. The restaurant's food was lackluster, bland, and overpriced. After that experience, we found other dining establishments - usually at the park. The shuttle service used to transport guests to Disneyworld was a joke. So many people were trying to crowd on the shuttle that people were standing in the aisles and on several occasions some were left behind (they would not send two shuttles for one destination - evidently it was not cost effective). It was uncomfortable for those standing, as well as uncomfortable for the ones sitting; if we took a corner a bit too quickly, you could end up with someone (literally) on your lap.

The rooms were a good size with a useful curtained off wash area and a quite small bath(shower over)/toilet room. I was very impressed with the size of the safe - it was big enough to store my laptop, paperwork, gifts, kids DS's etc and with plenty of room left! I was expecting wireless internet but it turned out we had an ethernet cable in the room which was still fine - it was free after all! The fridge was also a good sized half height fridge with an open freezer bit at the top. The air conditioning was fairly noisy and it took a good week before we could get it just balanced to keep us cool but so it clicked off every so often to give us some peace. The maids were very pleasant and made the beds and changed the towels everyday. I think the sheets were changed once a week. I did notice the bath and sink area wasn't cleaned very often. The complimentary shuttle service was great although it could be overcrowded and not always punctual. It did always come though and the drivers were very courteous. We missed the shuttle one evening from Magic Kingdom so got a taxi which was only $24 inc tip. We used the pizzahut delivery service a few (too many!) times which was good. There were plenty of restaurants within walking distance and there was no need to cross the extremely busy road if you don't want to risk it. I'd be cautious about the chinese restaurant next door though as the place was very dirty inside and the food was just warm and appeared as though it had been recooked. If you do eat there the sweet & sour chicken was nice and fresh, probably because it was a popular dish with a better turnover. The Walgreens in the hotel carpark was useful and aswell as selling toiletries and medicines and a small range of gifts/t-shirts, they sold sandwiches and drinks.

We were staying at the Best Western Lakeside Resort for the entire week so that we could visit Disney World. We arrived past check in time but there were no problems and check in went smoothly. The layout of the hotel is a bit confusing as the building numbers do not correspond with the rooms. We were in building 8 but our room was 660. The room was comfortable and large enough for 4 people (my parents, my daughter and me). We had double beds, fridge, nice size tv, shower, and a nice view of the pool. There are several pools on the property and it has the whole Florida feel with palm trees and beach style setting. My daughter got to play in the kiddie pool made especially for little ones that cannot swim. It only had a foot of water in it. It also had a playground with sand in it for kids. The hotel has restaurants inside and a good buffet breakfast. There's also a Pizza hut inside that delivers at late hours. The fitness room is a little small but it does have several treadmills and workout benches. There is miniature golf there on property that guests can play for free. In our room, it was clean and made up daily. The only problem we had was the hair dryer and light were out over the sink. I called guest services and they sent someone over in about 30 minutes but he had the wrong supplies. He returned some 2 hours later but fixed the problem. The hotel has an efficient shuttle to Disney parks that were great. Hotel staff were friendly and if you can't afford to stay on property, this is a great place to stay for convenience and price. The hotel is also near many shopping places and fast food places. Also, we stayed in the same building with a bunch of loud teens but could not hear them once we were inside the room.

We enjoyed two games on mini golf, which again is already paid for with the resort charge. Whilst not being the newest mini golf in the area, it was still fun, challenging (to some more than others!!!!!) and kind of charming! The on site shop was good with a selection of fuits, pre packed salads, sweets and snacks available. The poolside bars do delicious frozen Pina Coladas also!!! All round enjoyable stay at the best Western Lakseide. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, and would recommend to families and friends!

My first impressions were of disappointment as the room looked decidely dated and not at all what I expected from a \"recently reburbished\" hotel. I wasn't in Orlando to sit in a hotel all day long though so this wasn't a major problem, and after a few days I started to feel fairly comfortable there. Be warned that the rooms are VERY noisy (at least mine was). I stayed in an upper floor room in a building away from the pool and heard everything going on around me from people walking past, cars parking up outside, neighbouring rooms showers and toilets flushing and of course the sound of a very loud air conditioning unit: even if you turn yours off you'll still hear the air con from the surrounding rooms. EAR PLUGS ARE A MUST. If you've been to the parks all day though the beds are comfy (ours was brand new as it was changed to a new one a day or two into the holiday) so you should be too tired to care and will no doubt fall asleep pretty quick (with ear plugs). House cleaning was of a good standard, as was maintenance. One morning the handle of the shower came off in my hand. I reported it to the main reception and within 15 minutes the guys were there to take care of it. The hotel pool is nice enough although there wasn't much chance to use it. The hotel also offers internet access for 20 cents a minute and 70 cents a print off. If you just want to check your e-mail there is a PC right in the corner that offers free access for 10 mins at at a time. I didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food. Be aware that on arrival Guest Relations will try to get you to attend a timeshare presentation by offering you cheap tickets to a dinner show. Yes the tickets are cheap, but is it worth sitting through a timeshare presentation to get them? I'd say not, so be firm with them, these guys are quite pushy! Also, there is a resort fee of $3.50 a night that is payable on departure. We were made aware of this on check in and were told it was to cover the room amenities such as coffee maker and fridge, although to my mind these things should be standard in the room and not an additional extra. There are many diners, buffets, restaurants and fast food joints nearby, so if you can resist spending money on food in the Theme Parks you can find many cheap places to eat on the evening. Next door to the hotel is a Walgreens Pharmacy which sells practically everything you could want during your stay. The hotel itself is on a highway so other than the eating places and some very tacky gift shops (who on earth would want to buy an alligator head or a shark in a jar?) there is little else in the area. The main reason I chose this hotel (apart from its cost) was the fact that it has free shuttles to all major Theme Parks (Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Seaworld and Universal). The shuttles ran on time and served us well. From the hotel it was about 10 minutes to the Disney Resorts, and around 15 minutes to Seaworld and 25 to Universal. Things to consider about the shuttles however: If you are going to Seaworld or Universal the departure time is 7.45am which gives you plenty of time to get there before it opens, howevwer the earliest Disney shuttle is 9:15am to Animal Kingdom which means whichever park you go to you won't be there for opening time, which is a bit annoying especially if you are hoping to get there early to beat the crowds. The other shuttles to Disney Parks leave later so my advice would be to travel to Animal Kindom and take a Disney operated bus to the other parks from there. The latest shuttle back to the hotel was from Magic Kingdom at 10.30pm. The bus leaves from the ticket and transportation centre rather than from directly outside the Magic Kingdom (you need to catch a monorail to complete the journey). This makes watching the 10pm firework display practically impossible so this is also worth bearing in mind. The shuttle from Universal returns at 7.30pm so you won't be able to enjoy the Universal Citywalk or any of the evening entertainment it offers unless you find your own way back of course. Although the shuttles are free, each bus states that tips are part of the drivers salaries! Overall then the hotel was a good place to rest your head after a busy day at the parks. If you want free transport and don't mind a bit of noise it's ideal, if you want all of your home comforts then this probably isn't the place for you.

All the rooms have outside doors and there really isn't a view, but we didn't come to Florida to stay in the hotel. There are some stairs to get to the rooms and no elevators. The first night we were there we did swim in the pool which was heated. It was nice but the towels they provide at the pool area are tiny (like hand towels). I also thought they could have had more vending and ice machines. They do have a mini golf course and a shuttle to the parks but we did not use them.

The room was spacious and always spotless. A table for sitting and eating if required. Bathroom facilities perfect. Separate toilet from the sink area for convenience. We did Disney and Universal (12 hour days), the room was immaculate upon return and we had everything we needed. The coffee maker only makes one cup at a time, but if you need more coffee (it was really good by the way) the maids will gladly provide more as you need it. There was a fridge where we could store milk, juice, sodas and any takeout foods requiring refrigeration, just turn it up when you arrive as it is basically off until you adjust it and it takes about 12 hours to get really cold. Ice is right around the corner of your room if needed. The pools are fabulous, poolside bar accommodating to whatever you like to drink. Breakfast brunch in the restaurant is wonderful, bacon, eggs, sausage, home fries, all kinds of toast, bagels, croissants, cereal, omelets made to your liking, tons of fruit, coffee, tea and much more. Juice, milk, etc. is extra but the buffet is $9.00 each and kids ate for free when with a paying adult. There is a 24 hour Walgreens within walking distance of 1 minute right next door. Souvenier places everywhere, restaurants everywhere all within walking distance if needed. Shuttles to Disney and Universal are available at scheduled times for free to and from the sites. We ate at Wendy's, Bob Evans (all homemade food and really good and reasonable), Pizza Hut in the hotel (part of the restaurant), Chinese Buffet, MacDonalds, etc. Many, many other places we just never had the time to try. If you find you are exhausted after Disney or Universal (you will be), you can always grab a cab instead of waiting for your shuttle. It was $20. from Disney, about $35. from Universal. We drove to Clearwater one day, it took about an hour, 15 minutes. We went past the public beaches and down the coast to Indian Rocks where it was gorgeous and uncrowded, free to park along the beach walks.

We used the Sherbeth Road short cut into disney and could be in animal kingdom within 10 mins, the hotel does provide free shuttles but we had a car, if you wanted to eat at disney and have a drink you could use the internal transport to animal kingdom then a taxi from there back to the hotel was under $10. The kids loved the small play area, it had a spiral slide and climbing frame on an area of sand so they were happy, it was right next to the pool bar and the pool. The room service was efficient and on christmas day they still came around with clean towels although it was a less service on that day ( with advance warning).

It had a great breakfast buffet for $8.99 per adult and kids ate free under a certain age. They had a Pizza Hut onsite and computer access if you needed it. We purchased our Disney tix at the front desk and complimentary shuttle service is provided to the parks. They are only provided at certain times so you have to work around their schedule but keep in mind there are shuttles at the parks as well, so if you go to one of them you can transfer while at the park. We got ill while there and since we weren't from the area, we needed information on where we should go for medical attention. The front desk was quite helpful on this front as well. They also arranged the taxi pickup the morning of our checkout for our early morning flight.

We found it to be a clean, comfortable and very ordinary Orlando Motel with slightly above average accomodation in that it was cleaner and fresher than some I've stayed in, it had a hair dryer and iron and ironing board , coffe maker, fridge and colour TV in the rooms. (There is no microwave) .The pools looked clean and were in use by residents but we didn't bother, there were plenty of sun beds and tables and chairs.The rooms are the standard layout two double bed style ones any Florida traveller must be used to,there is a very nice breakfast room on site (Set price for breakfast buffet) which provides a very good breakfast and a believe kids ate free with an adult (we didn't take any children). Beware the concierge services whose main aim in life is to sell you time share, they can also sell you park tickets but I really dont believe they save you anything, be careful and unless you really want to spend hours being sold timeshare dont get sucked into the \"quick\" presentation. The reception staff were not really very helpful and just tried to fob you off onto the concierge people. The free transportation to Disney was useful and there were a few times to choose from to travel to and from Disney, this is helpful if you dont want to spend every waking minute in the parks . The transportation to Universal/Sea World only went at 7.45am amd back at 7.45pm which we felt was too long a day so we didn't bother. The free transportation to the small mall laid on by the hotel daily was very good, excellent \"Fossil\" out let store. There is also a \"World of Denim\" and many good eating places in easy walking distance of the Hotel we recommend the \"Golden Corral\" (just across the road if you dare cross it). There is a 24hr Walgreens just next to the hotel where you can buy basic grocery needs, milk, PG tips, bottled water, yogurt, shampoo etc. So for position (very close to Disney, shops and restaurants) this is a great hotel. For style and comfort its slightly above average. We had a great holiday, but we dont spend all day at the hotel we were out there in the parks or shopping (We love the Florida Mall but there are plenty of shopping opportunities), if you are someone who likes to spend plenty of time at your hotel perhaps this isn't the right one, but it's a perfectly acceptable base if all your going to do is sleep have breakfast and then get out there. If your going to Orlando that's probably what you've got in mind any way ! so go ahead book with confidence if it sounds your type of place, we'd stay here again .

We both consider ourselves to be \u201cbudget\u201d travelers and so I write this review and rate this hotel based on those levels of expectations. Overall I rate the hotel as acceptable for the price we paid of $45 a night. Items of note about the hotel and our room: - The location is great for access to Disney and Interstate 4 which takes you to pretty much all the attractions quickly and easily. - The room was relatively clean o The bathroom smelled a little moldy (I have experienced this at Hilton\u2019s as well), but here the smell leaked into the sleeping area. o The carpet and drapes had small stains. (no larger then 6 inches in diameter) - There was a nice pool area which we did not use, but there was no hot tub. - The beds were probably the worst thing about the room. The best way I can describe them was as soft on support and hard on cushion. My wife did complain about back pain from the bed because it lacked support. I would not recommend using the hotel ticket service. I had done a little homework before we came to Orlando on Disney tickets and so knew what we wanted and about how much they should be. We told the young lady working we wanted to visit Disney for 3 days and go to 3 or maybe 4 parks, so we were considering the \u201cPark Hopper\u201d. She informed us that in order to visit 3 parks we HAD to buy the \u201cPark Hopper\u201d. I told her we didn\u2019t but she insisted that we did. (I later confirmed with Disney that we did not have to buy it if we only wanted to visit one park a day) She also told us the Park Hopper gave us access to the water park which was open, again I told her I didn\u2019t think it did but she insisted that it did, 3 days later we attempted to get into the water park and were told we couldn\u2019t because we only had the \u201cPark Hopper\u201d. I mentioned the misinformation I was given upon check out but they did not really seem to care. I am not really upset about the entire ordeal because we got exactly what we wanted for the price we expected, but I do expect people to know what they are talking about when selling a product.

We contacted housekeeping about the problem, and they did send someone right away to fix the problem. - There was a bad odor in the bathroom - we finally discovered it was the shower curtain, which had a very unpleasant musty odor. Also, the bath towels were small, thin, and rough. - The bed springs were loud - you could hear them squeaking when you moved. - The hotel's restaurant was not open for dinner. - The hotel has free mini-golf, but we played at dusk, and half of the lights around the course were broken. - We tried to purchase Disney tickets in the lobby. The man at guest relations at first offered us a good deal, but of course there was a catch; listen to a two hour presentation at a new hotel near Epcot. Our time was worth more than the discount. - My wife asked housekeeping for an extra pillow; they said it would be no problem but never delivered it. - The motel has very basic cable, but it seemed like just a few channels. Also, when we watched a movie on TBS there was an annoying buzzing sound from the TV. - As other reviewers have noted, the AC is very loud. However, we were happy about this one of the nights; the sound helped drown out the yells of the teenagers at the pool well past midnight. When we contacted the front desk, they said they would send someone over to the pool to quiet them down, and it did seem to work. - Another noise issue occurred the same night; at around 3:50 am, a very loud group (?) or couple entered the room next to ours. Apparently the walls aren't too thick - we could hear everything in their room, including some things that we didn't really need to hear. My wife was hoping that the kids wouldn't wake up and ask why the woman was screaming (not in pain). They then put the TV on very loudly, finally turning it off around 6:00 am. - There were a couple of strange incidents from housekeeping. At one point the TV didn't work; I discovered that the maid had unplugged it when making up the room. Another time the air was left on in the room during the day, set to 62 F. These aren't major issues, but still rather odd. Pros: - Check-in and out were very quick - no problems. Do be aware that there is a $3.50 resort fee added to your rate. - The fridge in the room was very convenient to have a quick breakfast of milk and cereal in the room. - The in-room safe was much larger than usual - also very convenient. - The room had free wireless Internet access. - Location was good - a busy strip of motels & restaurants very close to the entrance of Disney. There was quite a bit of traffic on the main road in the morning and returning at night, though. Overall, we were disappointed by our experience at the Best Western Lakeside. We have visited Disney many times in the past (since we live in Miami), and there are far better places to stay. The area around Disney is saturated with hotels - do a little research and I'm sure you can find better accommodations for the same price range.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Cheap Base!\u201d", "Author": "Laramakia", "ReviewID": "UR12007981", "Content": "I spent a week here at the end of nov/beginning for Dec with my husband and 2 teenage daughters. overall this hotel was great for the price we paid and I would stay here again.

Its also really easy to cross the 192 at this point to quickly go in either direction so making life easier if you arent used to driving on the wrong side like my husband. We were in an upstairs room in block 5 and despite the block being pretty full it was very quiet at night .. my only complaint i guess would be the horrific noise from the air-conditioning, it sounded like a jet taking off and constantly switched on and off! but then you are so tired at the end of the day that you dont notice that much really :-) the rooms were kept very clean and were well maintained and the reception staff were helpful and friendly on the 2 occasions we needed help. the on-site pizza hut was handy, if a bit limited on choice and I never ventured into the pool but my daughters used it a couple of afternoons and said it was ok, (although they did seem to have a problem with flies in the water). we didnt use the hotel bar or shuttle service, and didnt eat there other then pizza so cant comment on any of that but everyone we saw there seemed happy", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA decent base\u201d", "Author": "NCVienna", "ReviewID": "UR11879029", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Lakeside for four days in mid-December. All things considered, I would say it was a decent and very conveniently located base for exploring the Orlando area, at a very reasonable price (we got a fantastic deal from priceline.com - 2 flights from North Carolina and the room for 4 nights for $440 for the two of us!) On the plus side, staff were very friendly, and the cleaners were excellent. They even returned one afternoon to tidy the room and supply us with fresh towels, sachets of coffee etc. after we had told them in the morning that we were fine... The location is great, and gives you plenty of choices for reasonable dining (the Red Lobster across the street was a pleasant dining experience). On the minus side... first of all, they will try to lure you with a free breakfast to attend a timeshare presentation next door. That would be ok, only they don't tell you that that's what it is... only when I asked directly, did they admit that yes, it was actually a presentation, not just a complimentary free breakfast. In my view, that is dishonest. The musty, damp smell in the room is pretty overwhelming, unless you let the A/C run on high all day and all night (noisy, and with temperatures in the 60s, not an option). We can still smell it in our clothes, even after one laundry. That's not the hotel's fault, but simply the Florida climate I guess. I had forgotten how much I hated the motel set-up - the fact that you cannot open a window, or even draw the curtain without people walking past and looking in. You are also at the complete mercy of the people around you - screaming children at 6.30 AM (and parents who obviously did not think that was an issue for other guests), and party-goers returning at 3 AM one night, shouting and brawling in the parking-lot. They only calmed down after one guest threatened to call the police. Overcharging... again, that seems to be an Orlando, rather than a Bestern Western issue. Be prepared to spend a lot more money than you could have ever budgeted for. In the hotel, the mediocre breakfast buffet cost over $20 (incl. tax) for two people - unless you are a huge morning eater, really not worth the money. It's easier (and a bit cheaper) to just grab a few items (muffins, bacon and egg biscuits) in the inhouse deli - at least you'll have snacks for during the day. Equally, the business center charges a minimum of $2 to even spend 60 seconds on the internet - if you want to print out something (like our boarding passes for the return flight), be prepared to spend another $2... All in all, the Best Western was a decent base for our four days' stay and offered everything we needed. I doubt that I would want to spend 2 weeks there.", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel but noisy A/C, plus Seaworld free tickets tip.\u201d", "Author": "Rattylover", "ReviewID": "UR11621056", "Content": "We stayed for two weeks at Best Western Lakeside in early December. We booked thorugh lastminute.com and had our flights and hotel combined. Getting there was easy: we just booked a return Mears Shuttle at the airport, quite cheap at $32 return each. The hotel is in a good location, surrounded by reasonable restaurants, and set way back from the highway so there is no traffic noise, unlike many of the other hotels nearby, We got a take-away from the Golden Corral every night and ate it in our room. A bit annoying that you're charged by the pound and my tomatoes cost the same as my boyfriend's steak, but still cheap and tasty. The on-site supermarket/pharmacy Walgreens was great, we bought our snacks and water from here every day, a gallon for $1.19, as we find florida water rubbery tasting and undrinkable. We were disappointed at first not to have a room with a nice view, but were instead at the back, in the more secluded end of the carpark. This turned out to be a blessing. I advise you NOT to book a room with a pool view, the noise from here was dreadful until late into the night. Our room was well away from all the activity, we were very lucky, no rowdy people or music or kids or anything. The only problem was the air conditioning. This is so ridiculously loud we didn't even have ours on, but were troubled by the low rumbling from the units on either side of us. I wear ear-plugs but was still disturbed by this. Ironically, no-one was staying on either side of us, but the maids put the units on regardless. Not very environmentally friendly, and a damned nuisance. Apart from this, the room was absoutely perfect. Clean, cosy, nicely decorated, with free cable TV and a safe using a code of your choosing. You will be required to pay $3.50 per room per day for the use of these amenities but even then it's still great value. The free shuttles were good but the times aren't great: leaving at 7.45am for seaworld when it doesn't open till later in the morning, so you're forced to wait around for 40 minutes or so for it to open. Then coming back at 7.30pm means this is a long day. But the Disney times are much better and you can always sleep in and get the 10.45 shuttle, then take a free disney bus to a different park. We tipped the shuttle drivers at least once a day as these guys are on low low wages and rely on tips, many people didn't and i felt a bit sad about that. We never once found tip envelopes left by the maids, so maybe it's just a select few who are a bit more aggressive. There's a lovely lake where you can spot some interesting bird life, albeit framed by the neon signs of Golden China etc. We never spotted an alligator but there are signs there warning of them (they're only tiny). Seaworld tickets are usually $70 or so each. We were offered two for $50 total by the man at the hotel customer information desk, in return for attending a timeshare presentation in another, far-off hotel. We weren't sure whether to do this or not. As it happened, we then went to the Golden Corral and a lovely woman called Robyn offered us two tickets for free if we went to a timeshare presentation only five minute's walk away. We gave a $20 deposit, gritted our teeth, and went (Westgate Resorts). We didn't speak a word and showed not a flicker of interest and they gave up the second our 90 minutes were done. Viola, two free tickets to Seaworld, plus our $20 deposit duly returned. (Apparently if you go for the timeshare then cancel it within the ten day period, they charge you sneakily for the disgusting free breakfast buffet and $50 for the book of info they gave you, so best not to be sucked in at all). All in all, if I was to return to Florida I would head straight back to Best Western Lakeside. However, I realise that, so often in hotels, your experience depends on your room allocation, and I think we were luckier than others who were closer to the pool or had to deal with noisy neighbours. The hotel grounds were clean and attractive, the location convenient, and there are free local calls for any bookings you might need to make.

The weather was perfect, the parks were great, the hotel however was AWFUL! I often read the reviews on Trip Advisor before I book a holiday and when I see a bad review I think to myself how miserable some people are and that people are exagerating on their reviews, but with hotels like the Best Western Lakeside I now know why! The first room we were placed in was very dirty, with the carpet coming away from the wall, dust, dirty tiles in the bathroom, broken tap on sink, and was generally like stepping back to the 1980's. On our 3rd night in the hotel we were joined in the room by a large cockroach. When we called reception to ask someone to come and get rid of it all they could say was \"We will call pest control tomorrow\". Eventually we persuaded them to send someone, and they sent a security man to dispose of it. There was no apology whatsoever, even on the first phone call, and there was no follow up. We ended up having to buy cockroach repellent to spray over the room! 6 nights into our stay we were disturbed at 10:15pm by screaming kids from the swimming pool outside our room. It wasn't just the odd scream here and there, it was continuous shouting from around 20-30 kids in the pool. We called reception to complain and they said \"the pool will close in 45 minutes, you will have to wait!\" Once again there was no apology for this, and no follow up. The following night we were awoken throughout the night (12am-4am) by people walking in and out of their rooms, slamming doors, talking and chatting. After getting back to sleep we were once again woken up by shouting kids in the car park at 8am. 7:15pm that same evening we were trying to watch the television in our bedroom and the noise from the 20-30 kids in the pool was so loud that we couldn't even hear the television. This time we spoke to the Duty Manager and she informed us that there were 5 groups of football teams in the hotel, hence why there was all the noise, and said she would move us to a quieter part of the hotel. The next room we moved too, once again at 12am we could hear people talking loudly outside, and was awoken this time at 7am to screaming teens in the car park shouting from the balcony (3 doors down from our room). Instead of moving us to a quieter block, we had actually been placed in the SAME block as the football teams, hence all the noise in the morning. That morning we went down at 8:30am to speak to the Virgin Holidays rep, and even though she acknowledged we were outside the room waiting for her to finish her welcome meeting, she kept us waiting for over 1 1/2 hours (without coming out to tell us to come back at a certain time). When we eventually spoke to her she told us we could move to another hotel but would have to pay the difference, which we refused to do, seeing as that the hotel should have been providing the service of at least letting us sleep at night, seeing as that was all we were there for (as we were in the parks most of the day!). After speaking to another receptionist, the rep managed to get us moved to a very quiet room at the back of the hotel (which we should have been moved to in the first place!) We told them that we would have some breakfast and then let them know when we were ready to move so they could carry our cases over. At 12:30pm that day, whilst showering in the 2nd room (before moving to the third) we were interrupted by a man who had just been checked into our room (even though they hadn't even serviced the room yet or checked to see if we had left). We called reception and once again there was NO apology, and the receptionist was extremely rude and said they had ASSUMED we had already moved rooms (even though they hadn't even checked or serviced it knowing that we had slept in it the night before!). We called reception at 1pm to tell the receptionist we were ready for our luggage to be moved, and then went out shopping. At 3:30pm when we returned to our new room the luggage had still not been moved, and once again when calling reception there was NO apology. Other problems included being called at 11:30am by the Room Attendant from the room next door asking if we were having our room serviced that day, despite having DO NOT DISTURB on the door. There were dead cockroaches on the stairs and in the corridors, which would take at least 2-3 days to clear. Like a previous review states we were also inundated with tip envelopes from our housekeeper daily. They would always change position to ensure that we would see it, and we too found one hanging from our lamp! The staff in the hotel were generally very rude and unprofessional, with some staff, including receptionists wearing tracksuit hoodies, instead of profesional uniform. Overall the Best Western Lakeside is a hotel which clearly doesn't take it's guests very seriously and has no sense of customer service. Despite having to move rooms 3 times and speaking directly to a Duty Manager, we were not once presented with any form of written or verbal follow up or apology.

When we first arrived to our room for our 2 week stay, there were a lot bugs and flying insects in there and at this point, I would usually go for another room, the reason we didn't was because we figured the housekeeping may of had the door opened while they were cleaning. We killed the insects and through the first few days, there were more. It didn't take me long to figure out where they were coming from. The doors to all the rooms have at least a 1 inch gap beneath them and this is how they are getting in. We even saw a lizard in the guest room window next to ours !! To solve the issue through our stay, I put a towel under the door and each morning I removed it, it was soaked ?? This is a very important issue, if not addressed, it will ruin the carpeting and allow little creatures to visit !! Also, for those that like to sleep in during the morning, this is not the place for you !! Doors start slamming around 7am and continue banging for most of the morning along with laundry carts rolling by every 1/2 hour on the hour !! Housekeeping did a fairly good job throughout our stay, but they do overlook the fan vent in the bathroom that is piled with dirt. Also, drainage is very slow in the tub and our vanity sink water trickled out at best, I figured it must be a water saver. They missed our room once during our 14 night stay and this could be that we slept in until 2pm one afternoon.

Not much hanging space but loads of draws and most of our clothes didnt need hanging anyway, just t shirts and shorts,afterall this is not a drsssing up holiday. A fridge with small freezer box inside and a coffee maker were in the rooms as well as a tv and air con unit.

They run to all the different parks throughout the morning and at 5pm to MK as well. Then they depart the different parks throughout the evening. If the bus isnt going to the park you want, at the time you want ,just go to one of the other parks and use the Disney transport system to link up (this includes the water parks as well). Same at night. For instance , the Epcot bus returns at 8.15pm but the fireworks dont start till 9pm. So we watched the show then got the monorail to the Magic kingdom and returned on the 10.15pm bus from there. Good tip - one night we missed the last bus from MK, so we got the Disney transport bus to the Animal Kingdom Lodge as this is really close to the Best Western, then got a taxi from there to our hotel.

It was the worst of all the hotels we stayed at. Not for its locality or facilities but for its poor poor customer services. They only booked us in for 2 nights when the booking was for 3. After arriving back at 11pm and being locked out of my room, the last thing I needed was to deal with a liar. I went to reception to see why I was locked out and they said the booking was only for 2 nights. I disagreed as I had checked my voucher 500 times before I left home. I asked him to check again. The guy went out back for all of about 10 secs and said that he had spoken to the manager and they had looked at the voucher again and it was definately only 2 nights. I told him he was wrong and asked him to show me the voucher so I could see for myself. He went out back again and after about 5 minutes came back to say there was a mistake and I was booked for 3 nights afterall. No apologies. My main problem with all of this was the lies they told me. I can understand that mistakes happen, but why lie about it. I made a complaint which fell on deaf ears, so I made another complaint via there online website. This person again made ecxuses rather than deal with my complaint which was the liars at reception. What do they care really if one guy kicks up a stink. There were a few other things that rubbed me the wrong way, like trying to sign you up to a time share convention for cheap disney tickets, without telling you it was a timeshare seminar. Lucky I read the fine print back in my room. The internet room only had one computer which worked. No time limit so some people were there for hours. You get what you pay for I guess. If you are going to Orlando for disney which I guess most are, pay the few dollars extra and stay at a disney resort, there isnt much in it really. Thats what I am doing next year when I go back. Overall I was disappointed and wont go there again. I probably wont stay at best western again because of it.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kerensa", "ReviewID": "UR10067838", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 weeks - had to swap rooms the first night because of ants!

We were familiar with the area, so knew the location which is as good as you will get with regard to getting around the various attractions. Our arrival at the check in was quite late at night, and the girl on the desk was chatty and friendly, and when we asked for a quiet room, she said the one we were given met that criteria. When we arrived at the room, we noticed an array of beach towels on the verranda, indicating to us that the adjoining rooms were occupied with families. We decided not to unpack until morning to see what noise level was like, and sure enough, it started at 7 30 with kids running around, Adults out smoking etc etc. We then went back to reception and asked for another room in a quiet area, and the girl on the desk said that she would give us another room no bother, but could not guarantee it would be quiet. Considering that the Hotel was at about 10% capacity I don't think our request was too difficult to meet, but I do understand that they like to concentrate occupancy to facilitate room service etc. However, we got a room at the opposite side of the complex overlooking a Minor road (traffic was very light), and this proved fine. Families adjacent to us were probably just more considerate than the first room (a problem we have found worldwide nowadays). Rooms are typical of this type of Hotel, and had all the ammenities you would expect. The second room also appeared to have been refurbished and was nicer than the first. Air conditioning is always noisy in Hotels (we are not really used to it, coming from the UK, so we probably notice it more), but it worked as required. Housekeeping was a bit haphazard, with minimal soap/shampoo etc left for our use (rectified by call to front desk), The surrounding grounds of the Hotel were very pleasing to the eye, and were very well maintained, as were the pools and their deck areas. Due to the time of year, we never saw the Tiki bar opened (in our pool area), but there was a bar and dining area in the main building. We used the bar on an almost nightly basis, and the barman Petre was a great asset to the property, being both friendly and welcoming. With so many nearby restaurants to choose from, we only ever used the pizza hut for occasional snacks, so I cannot comment on the other eating establishments within the Hotel, but there were numerous pleasant eating areas that we saw. Overall I would recommend this Hotel to anyone, but it has the potential to be quite noisy if inconsiderate guests are present. Generally Orlando was as we expected (have been holidaying there for 12 years), but we did notice a slow down in new building work, and the demolition of older (not that old) shopping areas. On our second last day we visited the Disney town of Celebration, where within 20 minutes of arriving I got a parking ticket, for parking 'left wheel to kerb' - perfectly ok in the UK, and judging by other cars parked the same way, a lucrative earner for Osceola county - be warned the Sherriff cares not a jot for obvious tourists (letter of complaint sent as I couldn't even contest an incorrectly completed parking ticket, so had to pay over the phone with credit card).

There is also a games arcade on sight and a mini golf course. Some nights we went to shows and I really loved the dixie stampede, which had great entertainment and delicious food. We also went to the pirates dinner and show and altough I enjoyed myself, none of the rest of my family of seven did. I did agree with them though that the food was not very nice.

The three pools were nicely secluded away from the Irlo Bronson highway and the landscaping surrounding the pool areas is pretty with big palm trees.

In addition, I booked the room with an AAA discount, but since I failed to produce it upon check-in (they didn't ask), the rate reverted to the standard.

The Room: The main problem was the housekeeping. Our room was dirty. There was dust and long hair everywhere and the carpet was absolutely disgusting. Also, I could hear the maids and people walking outside even with the a/c on. Speaking of the a/c unit, it was VERY noisy and it leaked in our room so the carpet was wet near the entrance. Some previous reviewers also said the bathroom was very small and the room was dark and it is true. The Staff: People at the front desk were nice, even the pushy people who sell Disney tickets. I told them I was not interested and they didn't bother me afterwards. The Shuttle (Disney Park & Universal Studios): Avoid the shuttle! Sometimes it was full and people had to stand even though I was told prior to booking that they would send another shuttle if it was full. Other days they were late (15 minutes and more) so you really couldn't count on those people though I found them to be very nice. Also the shuttle schedule didn't make much sense to me. The shows at MGM and Epcot are at 9PM but the shuttle leaves those parks at 8:00 and 8:15 PM. You can always stay and then use Disney's transportation system to catch the bus at the Ticket Center but we did it once and we missed the hotel shuttle by 1 minute and had to pay $25 for a taxi to get back to the hotel. The Food: I only tried the onsite Pizza Hut twice and I found a LONG HAIR in my pizza the second time I went there. The guy apologized and gave me another one with free bread sticks which I appreciated but I really didn't feel like going back after this incident. There are plenty of restaurants nearby anyway. The Pools: There's 3 pools but one of them is very small. I enjoyed the 2 other pools but sometimes it was too crowded. I was glad our room wasn't near one of the pools cause it would've been very noisy. And for some odd reasons they only had a few parasols. Perhaps people steal them, I dunno.

If we wanted pizza then we just went down to the restaurant and got it there......they were busy but we got what we wanted no worries. To be honest we found no faults with the hotel..........it was about the standard we expected which was good. The pool was great and uncrowded......we couldnt keep our son out of it. The location was good as there is plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. The only problem we had was the free shuttle.........it was free but about 40 people try to cram onto a 20 seater bus.........not good.........and they only did one run per day..........it was like a 12 hour day at the parks and no guarantee you would get picked up........we decided to use cabs instead but they were expensive...........$35 to universal, $30 sea world, $18 disney world etc etc.......(all prices are one way). I mean the shuttle takes you to sea world for 8 am but the first show is 11.30 am............?.............on the bright side the shuttle to bush gardens is fantastic........good times and a guaranteed seat on the bus........well worth it.

I reserved a regular room for two adults with two beds at a rate of $55.20/night. When my travel companion and I got to the hotel very early in the morning and entered the room we were given we were not very happy. The room was not the dirtiest I have seen, but the carpet was very worn out. We asked to see another room at the same rate and again we were not satisfied. We ended up going to another hotel we read about online, the AmeriHost Inn, to see if they had better rooms. Well after that hotel showed us a room full of bugs, we ended up racing back to get a room at this Best Western. When we returned the nice young lady at the front desk, I believe her name is Amanda, ended up upgrading us to a pool view room for the same price as the regular room and this time the room was clean. Kissimmee is not the fun and resort like area it is advertised to be. Based on how many of the other hotels in the area looked from the outside, I think this Best Western is really as good as it gets for Kissimmee. If I were to come back to the Disney area I would probably spend the extra money to stay at on of the resort hotels in one of the theme parks. I think especially if traveling with kids, staying in Kissimmee just takes away from the fun of an Orlando theme park vacation. The hotel also charges a $3.50 resort fee, so I ended up paying $58.70/night before taxes.

We chose this hotel because of the previous reviews and because we are students (ie, on a strict budget). This hotel was everything we expected and more! Check-in was quick and easy, and the room was large and clean. The best part of the hotel was the location - close to the theme parks, but also right beside a 24 hour Walgreens where we purchased water/snacks for a really good price. There were also many restaurants (both fast food and sit-down) within a few minutes walk. The buffet breakfast was good - enough of a variety that we were not sick after 10 days of eating it. The best part was, we ate a lot in the morning so that we didn't need to eat much at the theme parks (where it is expensive!), and when we got back at night we could just go to a restaurant within a few minutes. Having been to Orlando only once when I was young, I wasn't sure what to expect with the shuttles. It was better than I had hoped for. Shuttles departed daily and at multiple times in the morning to each of the theme parks. They also picked up at different theme parks at different times at night, usually enough to get a full day in. If you don't like the pick up/drop off time, here's a tip - take whatever shuttle you want to Disney, then use Disney's free inner transportation to go to whatever theme park you choose. Doing this, we were able to see Illuminations (the firework show) at Epcot and make it back to the Magic Kingdom in time to catch a late shuttle. The only shuttle where this is not possible is the one to Universal studios/Sea World, but it does give you enough time to have a full day in, and there is always lots of shopping in that area if you tire of the theme park. If you don't mind a bit of waiting sometimes, you don't need to rent a car at this hotel, which saved us a LOT of money. The staff was fairly friendly, although we did not deal much with them as we had no complaints. The beds are a little uncomfy, and the air conditioner a little loud, but after a day walking around Disney, you can sleep through anything!

Its not a bad hotel by any means but with two changes this hotel would not only be ideal but an excellent choice for anyone stopping in the Kissimmee area. Its good value for money and I hope the hotel takes a note of what i say and acts upon them. Firstly the good points, check in went very smoothly and we were given various vouchers as we booked through Virgin which we could use at the restaurants and allowed the children to eat and drink for free. The two rooms we had over looking the lake were very nice containing two queen beds, safe, television, telephone, fridge and bathroom (small). The room was cleaned daily and the cleaning staff for our room 254 were helpful and good at their job. The grounds were quite well kept as was the pool and miniature golf area. The breakfast buffet was also excellent, lots of choice and nice food. Two major annoying bad points. The shuttle to the parks. The shuttle only runs and returns from the hotel to each park once a day . One day it rained after we arrived at Magic Kingdom and had to wait another 8 hours for the bus or get a taxi. We grabbed a taxi but in my opinion the shuttle should run and return to each park at least twice a day. Also there is absolutely no queuing system for the shuttle, it is just a complete \u201cfree for all\u201d, whether you have been waiting 20 minutes or 2 minutes when the shuttle arrives everyone rushes forward and gets on. Very annoying especially with children. The other annoying area is the service in Hurricane Sam\u2019s restaurant. It is very very understaffed, sometimes you can wait 40 minutes to get your food. If you are lucky enough to get Eddy then you are in good hands. If there were another 5 of him then im sure that the problem would be solved, he deserves a pay rise and promotion. Other staff in the restaurant got the orders mixed up or on one occasion completely wrong, even when ordering coke (not diet coke \u2026\u2026\u2026 agggghhh). I guess you have to weigh up the cost saved against a hotel within Disney World Resort. For our two rooms we saved about \u00a31000 by not staying on resort and staying at Best Western Lakeside.

The Best Western Lakeside provided those two things and not a whole lot more. The room rates were very reasonable for what you get and the location really nice. There is no lake but a dirty pond. The rooms were very basic, very loud toilet, and the bathroom in dire need of an update. We felt that the rooms were exactly how they should be for the price you pay and perfect for those only needing a place to sleep. The pool was nice and the pool bar and laundry room was a added plus. The problems that we had that we are very upset about was the staff. We went on the time share visit from the front desk because we were curious and we saved money on disney tickets. Don't purchase the time share! Anyway we purchased a two day ticket with the 3rd day either going to Pleasure Island or a water park for free. We went to Pleasure Island on the last night we were there and when we used our pass to get inside the clubs we were told that it was not valid. We explained to the person at the door what happened and he was very kind and gave us bracelets to get in all the clubs. The ticket was supposed to do that. We were leaving the next morning very early so I did not complain about that. Before leaving I asked the front desk person how to get to a rental car location and she said ask the other person, I have no clue what title she held but someone who is supposed to help you in whatever you needed. When I asked her, her response was, \"It's in the airport because all rental car places are in the airport.\" I resonded with no it is not because we took a shuttle from the airport to this rental location. She then said \"Well I dont know.\" What a worthless employee and a waste of space. If she can't even help me get somewhere when this is her job then what is she good for, NOTHING.

Check in went quickly, we had to give a credit card for incidentals and they said they would only hold $20 on it. They told us to go to the booth next to them for a welcome package. The guy there gave us a little Disney memory book and then tried to get us to buy tickets. We stood there for about 15 minutes and after a while, he became pushy when we didn't want to buy the tickets as we already had some. The first day we had housekeeping come, when we got back, our door was left ajar. That made me a little uncomfortable, as I had a laptop and some other expensive things in the room. Early the next morning, we were woken to screaming from next door. The people were screaming at each other and it sounded like slapping also. I called the front desk to let them know (they didn't seem to care). I heard their phone ring a few minutes later and it went silent. A few minutes later, we heard a knock at our door. We stayed there. Another knock. My husband went to look and it was them at the door. That also made us uncomfortable. We were due to check out the next day, but our flight home got bumped back a few days, so I called the front desk to see if we could stay longer. They had a bit of a problem with that. At first, they said it was ok, that we could get the same rate for the three nights. We just had to go to the front desk and get our keys redone. When we got to the front desk, they said we were only there for one more night and not three. They said we could get the two nights after that for a much higher rate, and not the rate that they promised us. They told us they would check with the manager and let us know. We went to lunch after that. I booked a room at another Best Western closer to Disney so I could get my rate. When we got back to the room, there was a message saying that we were all set, we could stay one more night for our same rate. It was too late. We had already booked our room at the other Best Western. My husband happened to check his credit card and apparently, they tied up almost $300, when they were only supposed to use $20. That went our whole vacation. When he called the front desk, the person there said that he would call the credit card company and have those funds released and then call us back. We never got a phone call. Towards the end of our stay, the housekeeping staff got sloppy. The first day we had our room cleaned, they put soap and everything neatly in a folded towel on a soap dish on the sink. The second day, it wasn't in a towel. The third day, it was thrown all over the sink. Today was the day that we checked out. My husband called his credit card company again and the funds were still tied up. I went to check us out of the room and they asked me if we were checking out early. I said no, they had only booked us for one more night (last night) because they couldn't get us the same rate. They didn't really say much after that. I checked out and asked them about my husband's credit card and the girl at the front desk said the funds should be released by midnight tonight. We'll see. I recommend not going to this hotel if you are on a budget. The front desk staff is fairly rude and lie to you, the ticket salespeople are very pushy, and housekeeping leaves your door unlocked.

There are a few positives and negatives about this hotel. We came on Sunday morning and asked for early check-in. However, we were told the hotel was fully booked and we could not get in. I thought that was fine, because the check in was 3 pm and I did not expect to get in early. If you want to solely depend on hotel shuttle to go to Disney, Seaworld and/or Universal Studio, check out my comment below. Positives: -Clean room -There is a Walgreen within 3 minutes walk. -Wendy's and Burger King are next to the hotel. Taco Bell and Red Lobster are across the street. A few minutes walk will take you to a Denny's, Sizzler's, a supermarket, Chinese restaurant, and a Japanese restaurant. We ate at Giordano's, an Italian restaurant. The pizza was great. We also ordered Chinese food delivery from Full House (the menu and phone # are located in the hotel guest directory in each room). The Chinese food were good, too. Negatives: -Shuttle departs to Seaworld and Universal early morning at 7:45 AM. Picks up guests from Universal at 6:40 PM and Seaworld 6:55 PM. You must wake up early. If you don't like to wake up early during your vacation, check out bus line 56 to Disney and transfer to line 50 to Seaworld. check --- -To Animal Kingdom at 9:15 AM and picks up at 5:45 PM. Even though it normally closes at 5 PM. So, you must spend 45 minutes in gift shops or waiting. Inconvenient. -To Magic Kingdom at 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM, pick ups at 5:20 PM, and 10:15 PM. It normally closes at 7 or 8 PM. Either you go home early, or you transfer to another park to go home. Inconvenient. -To MGM at 10:45 AM, pick up at 8 PM. -To Epcot at 10:45 AM, pick up at 5:30 and 8:15 PM. -The shuttle was late 30 minutes once. -I called front desk to ask about a loud machine used by some workers in front of my room at 9 AM. Good thing I was already awake. I asked, \"How long can I expect them to work in front of my room?\" I was answered, \"Why don't you step out and ask them?\" Bad customer service.

The entrance to the hotel and lobby was inviting and tropical. The check in went quickly and smoothly. We upgraded to a different room that we wanted initially but that wasn't available when we made our reservation, with ease. The overall appreance of the outside of the hotel was pretty good. They have more the one pool, I think three. We stayed in a pool view room and I would advise that if you are planning on catching up on your sleep and not getting up early, then you won't want a pool view room. It's very noisy, early. The room appeared to have been cleaned and the towels were stocked. What I didn't like and felt should have been fixed before our stay was a gash in the wall near the floor by the TV. Also, as we were preparing for bed, we noticed a big gash/almost hole in the wall behind our bed and the area behind the bed didn't look like it had been cleaned. I worried about bugs with this opening behind the bed. The bed seemed to be clean and didn't smell. What I didn't like though was that they used a flat sheet as a bottom sheet which moved and bunched up as we slept, uncovering the matteress below. The air conditioning had a funny smell initially and I wondered about this, maybe it is common but it seemed to go away. The fridge in the room was barley cool, although we didn't ask the front desk about this, maybe there was a way to turn it up. We liked the safe in the room it was easy to use. The Pizza Hut express that they offer on site is rediculiously priced. Twenty dollars for a medium pizza! Their breakfast buffet is cheap, but you get what you pay for sometimes because it tasted cheap as well. The eggs looked slimey and the sausage tasted generic and the bacon was clumped together in a bin. It was warm in the resturant to, even the employees were fanning themselves with the menues. I asked 2 employees about a waterfall rock garden that was advertised on the Best Western website while we were in the breakfast buffet resturant and neither knew were it was. In my opinion the Dennys down the street would have been a better breakfast choice. The location of this hotel is really great though. There's a Walgreens practically in the same parking lot and plenty of fast food resturants and a Kmart just down the street. Getting to Disney is a snap and close by. One more thing I would say about the hotel is there was no elevator, at least we couldn't find one. So we were on the second floor and had to hike up a small stepped stair case to get our luggage to our room.

Some of the basic problems -- (1) very, very RUDE and unhelpful staff -- they seemed to go out of their way to be obnoxious; (2) unreliable shuttle to the Disney parks (and, by the way, the times of the shuttle are unrelated to the operating hours of the parks -- the Magic Kingdom closes at 8:00 on Sundays and the shuttle comes at 10:15 -- we had to take a cab, which cost $25); (3) very musty, damp rooms -- a lot of the kids in the group got sick (coughs etc.) and I think it was in part due to the condition of the rooms (although I should point out that the rooms were quite clean otherwise); (4) shady deals at the restaurant (they overcharged my credit card and refused to re-ring the transaction -- I got the feelingy that they probably do this routinely and skim the extra few bucks -- it was not a lot of money (less than $5) but you get the point; I informed the front desk and they could have cared less); (5) very small bathrooms (so small that it was difficult to change clothes inside); (6) very inconvenient \"business center\" -- it was difficult to print my boarding passes for our return flight; and (7) pretty far from the airport -- a $50 to $60 ride via hired car or taxi (it would probably be worthwhile to rent a car). Some of the positives (there are almost always some!): (1) there was a Walgreens store next door -- very convenient; (2) although there was some shady business at the restaurant (see above), the food was good and reasonably priced; (3) the A/C worked quite well; (4) although we did not use them, there are 3 pools that looked quite nice; and (5) a small but very nice excercise room.

Room had clearly just been refurbished, painwork immaculate, carpet new etc and new curtains changed to match decor during our stay! Beds really comfortable, furniture good, coffee machine, hairdryer and fridge worked perfectly. Whole family thought shower fantastic! Service was fast when required, safe found locked on arrival was opened by very apologetic security guy within a couple of minutes of calling, towels found missing just after midnight on our last night replaced by another very apologetic security guy who arrived withing five minutes of our call.

Also, the wardrobe had a weird smell. I complained on Monday and it took them 2 days to see they couldn't fix ithe A/C problem. We were then offered to change to a room by the poolside and to have free breakfast for the remaining 4 days which was nice. The second room was much better, it seemed newer than the 1st one * Breakfast: although it was free for us after the incident above (the regular price is 6.99 in September), it wasn't great compared to the breakfast from Ponderosa (3.99) and Golden Corral (6.49 after applying coupons find everywhere). If you have a car while in the hotel, PLEASE try to eat somewhere else.

The Best Western Lakeside is an excellent hotel for people on a budget. I booked it as a late deal through a UK travel agent and having spent many Orlando vacations staying in vacation homes I was a little worried that staying in a hotel would feel cramped and uncomfortable. However, the Best Western Lakeside restored my faith in hotels. It's location was excellent, central to everything we wanted to do and had plenty of restaurants around and some within walking distance, especially if you're brave enough to cross the 192. The room was fairly spacious, we had two good size double beds and ample stoage space. There was a mini fridge and also a safe in the room which came in handy for storing valuables. The bathroom wasn't the biggest but the sink was outside the main bathroom, just the bath/shower and toilet in the actual bathroom. All satisfactory and plenty of hot water. The maid service was good, our room was cleaned and had fresh towels and linen daily and all this was done by 11am, unless we were in the room and they would come back at our convenience. Enjoyed our time spent by the pool. Only down side was not having parasols, or at least they didn't at the pool closest to our room. Saying that there were shaded areas under trees. There were usually plenty of free loungers and I thought the pool area was generally clean and tidy. I noticed staff cleaning the area regularly. The pool was lovely and refreshing and fortunately not too crowded during our visits. Also enjoyed the strawberry daquiris from the tiki bar....yum! I guess the prices are what you expect in hotels, slightly above average but not extortionate. As we had car hire we didn't use the shuttle service so I really can't comment on it. I found the hotel staff to be friendly and courtious at all times, no complaints at all.

Before booking, I read many of the reviews found here on TripAdvisor. I was concerned about the negative reviews, but for $12/night, we decided to take the gamble and we won! The rooms were clean and spacious enough for the ~8-9 hours we spent sleeping and grooming per day. We decided to be big spenders and pay the extra $10/night to upgrade to a poolside king bed (tall husband) with a pull-out coach for the two kids (they won't let you reserve it with 4 people, but ask for it at the desk when you get there). Our room was 515. It was plenty of room for everyone. The kids loved the pool. There were two large and two smaller ones on the property, all very clean. The pools were never crowded, but my kids found friendly kids their age to play with every day and really had a ball. We spent 5 days visiting the Disney parks and 1 day at Clearwater Beach.

Granted the rooms were smaller than I would have liked for a family of 5 but think it would fit a family of 4 or less fairly well with two beds. Since we were in Orlando mostly for attractions we spend very little time at the hotel and the kids loved the pool (for a night swim) and having Pizza Hut room delivery service. We were in section 5 which was very quite, away from the main lobby, though it had little in terms of a view (for $70 more I can look at the pool - which I passed on). The room as many have mentioned on Trip Advisor was fairly outdated but was clean and the beds were made daily. Each room had a mini fridge which was cool enough to chill our soda cans and milk for cereal at breakfast (Walgreens is a 1 minute walk from the hotel for cereal, milk and snacks). The staff was helpful and responsive and the food prices were reasonable for coffee and bagels w/butter and muffins. Overall I feel we got what we paid for and was not dissappointed for the price. A few pointers here: - There are Walmarts around that have sections devoted to Disney merchandise and souveners for far less - We bought Disney hopper passes for our family with young kids but never jumped from park to park. Each park when with young ones is essentially and all day event (and most we didn;t even get to do everything). If you have young kids don;t buy the hopper. - Universal was fun and well worth the money. Essentially our tickets for 5 days came out to a total of $50 each purchased online as opposed to Disney Hoppers at $275 each for a total of 4 days. - At Universal buy the meal and cup deal if you will stay all day.

Many earlier travellers write about the run down state of the hotel but I think they have recently spent much time and effort on refurbishing as we found our room, and the hotel in general to be very clean, tidy and well presented. OK, so there are minor things to gripe about as the hotel may not be as polished as some of the expensive Disney hotels nearby but for a base to sleep at night and spend the odd day by the pool, I have no complaints at all. Our room (292) was on the first floor overlooking the pool which was a short 1 minute walk from the reception. The hotel is a sprawl of 2 storey buildings but ours happened to be close to the main reception which was handy. The room was very clean, had fridge, TV, combination safe, en-suite bathroom and most inportantly of all - air conditioning!!! which was a life saver for us in the July heat. The room had what they class as a king size bed but if you are from the UK believe me, its bigger than king size!!! The bathroom had wash basin, toilet and bath / shower. Rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels left and beds made etc - if you want a lie in, leave your Do Not Disturb card out as the cleaners sometimes come as early as 9:30. The pool was clean and there are plenty of sun loungers. If you dont like the sun too much, grab a lounger under the shaded areas if you can. The pool is 7.5 feet at the deep end and about 3 feet deep at the shallow. There is a mini golf facility on the site but it is very basic - i mean VERY basic but it passed ten minutes one morning. There is a general store which also doubles as a Pizza Hut Express. The store is a bit pricey and I would recommend going to the Walgreens store just over the parking lot - less than 2 mins on foot. Its open 24 hours and sells everything you could imagine. The Pizza's from the hotel are nice enough and like most places in the states, if you dine in, you get free soda refils. The greehouse restaraunt offers breakfast for $9.50 and is a \"help yourself\" buffet so I was a bit bemused as to why they include a 15% tip on the bill when they only really bring you a drink which was extra by the way. Breakfast was a mix of bacon, sausage, egg, waffles etc, plus cereal, fresh fruit and made to order omlettes which were passable but not the best. There is a bar in the hotel called Hurricane Sam's which, again is passable but not the best. They have the usual choices of lager plus a cocktail menu. My biggest moan about the hotel was the shuttle services to the Disney Parks. There was 1 drop to each park each morning and then collections at times that arent really ideal. Drops started at 7:45 for Sea World / Discovery Cove and then came back and did Magic Kingdom, Epcot etc but there is only 1 bus each journey that sits 40 people plus maybe 10-15 standing and believe me they always get full. A little tip we found handy is that if you are waiting for the shuttle bus at the stop, stand just away from the sheltered seating towards the reception in between the shelter and the 2 benches that are open as this is were the bus stops and you will be one of the first onto the bus to avoid the mad scrum to get on. If they had a more frequent schedule that did 2 or 3 more trips to the parks through the day this would make things much better in my opinion. There are loads of places to eat within 10 minutes walk from the hotel - choices are everything from Chinese, to Indian, to Taco Bell, Red Lobster, Mcdonalds etc - both sit-in and take out. There are a wide variety of \"souvenir\" tacky shops plus some supermarkets and World of denim. Journey time to the Disney ticket and transport hub was about 15-20 minutes and for a budget minded traveller, this hotel makes an excellent base to do the disney parks.

If we return to this hotel again, we will reserve an adjoining room for the older children. The only negative I found was in the shuttle scheduling. The complimentary shuttles depart EARLY. . . 7:45 a.m. for Universal/Sea World and slightly later for the Disney properties. There is only one morning shuttle run for each park. After that, you are on your own until around 5:00 for the Disney properties. The shuttle does not return to drop off at Universal or Sea World, only to pick up, and that is early, too. . . 6:45. If you plan on staying at those parks until closing, you'll have to find alternate means of transportation. We rented a car, but for those who did not, transportation did become an issue.

Ok ,the decor is a bit old , but certainly no worse than most hotels in this class. The rooms are big , Tv had good reception and if you called down for anything like pillows...it was there in 10 minutes. We had room 196 which was right in front of the pool ......I would highly recommend that when you book that you ask for a room between 190-199 and then you will have the least walk to both the pool and the lobby/restaurant.....and you will be away from the car park. This is a big resort so we found it best to base ourselves as near as we could to everything....We had a wheelchair and everything was accessible. The swimming pool was gorgeous although they turned off the pool heat on June 1st so it was a little chilly first thing. The shuttles are excellent and they can carry strollers and wheelchairs with no fuss or bother. They can get a bit crowded so get to the bus stop and make sure you get a seat!! The breakfast was good at the hotel , but some of the waitresses are a bit liberal and charge you for extra things you didn`t order....happened all the time so check your bill. The shop is good and the Pizza hut had excellent buffalo wings and pizzas etc. Mind you the Golden Corral opposite is much cheaper for food so cross the 192 (not at the crossing or you`ll die!!....cross opposite the Golden Corral)and have a massive brekkkie and dinner is fabulous. For a more expensive and quality meal , turn right out of the hotel and there is a TGI Fridays , Cracker Barrel and Carrabas. Walgreens is in the parking lot of the hotel and was open 24hrs which was handy...they sell snacks and drinks which you could put in your cooler bag for the theme parks as they cost a fortune once you get there. The 55 Lynx bus stop is opposite the hotel and they are also wheelchair friendly. That`ll take you to Old Town which has shops and rides and real atmosphere....last bus back is 8.49 pm.You can also get a bus from old town to disney at all times (56)so don`t panic if you sleep in. The hotel was very comfortable......if you want the Crowne Plaza Universal....you won`t get it here , but I cannot think of a better hotel for convenience to the parks and amenities and I would really recommend it if you do not want to drive in Florida.

The rooms were very clean, we were always were provided with clean towels, clean sheets etc. The air conditioning units were noisy but we didnt need it on to sleep as our room always seemed cool. There was a TV with 22 channels, a fridge which worked wonderfully, the bathroom was small but the shower was lovely, always had plenty of hot water available. We had two big double beds, which were so comfy especially after 12 hours at the parks!! The Hotel. The pool was great, always so many sunbeds, the pool was always clean, there was a small pool bar, and clean towels were provided. We never went to the hotel breakfast as our fave was the Golden Corral across the road but what we did see it looked great. We used the small shop every day for early morning coffees and crossaints!! Pizza Hut was a bonus too. We ordered from the room and it was ready in minuites, it tasted so much better than UK pizza huts too! The grounds of the hotel were nicely kept too. I would say it is so much easier to hire a car while you are there, its not really a place you could walk anywhere to. There is a Walgreens on site but we found a little way down the road there is a huge Walmart which was so much better and cheaper. So if you have booked here and really concerned about the reviews please dont worry as its a great base to stay for the parks, it really is so close to Walt Disney World and its in a great location.

I chose this hotel because it was in my price range and because of the free shuttles to Disney AND Universal Studios. Here is what we thought of the hotel... Check-in - We arrived at 2:45 and were pleasantly greeted and checked in without any problem. We were given the option of first or second floor and we chose second. I would have liked a room facing one of the main pools, but we were facing one of the parking lots and another one of the hotel buildings instead. Room - our room was quite pleasant. Looked just like the rooms on the website. Two double beds, TV, dresser, small table with two chairs, mirror & sink outside of bathroom, small bathroom with toilet and tub. Also an in-room safe, small fridge and air conditioning. The beds were comfortable and the whole room was very clean. We didn't really like the towels though...they seemed to leave a white residue the first time that we used them. They get replaced each night, so the same problem happened each day with the new towels. That was minor though. Shuttles - the free shuttles to the parks were great. The times worked great for us. This is one of the only hotels that I could find that offered free shuttles to Disney and to Universal. They were a little late picking us up at the end of the day from the parks, but that was only minor. The drivers were quite friendly. A caution about calling \"cabs\" from the hotel...if you ask the desk to call a cab for you, they actually call the shuttle service instead and the shuttles don't have meters in them and they will charge you a flat rate, which could be more than a cab. This kind of annoyed us when we asked them to call us a cab for Downtown Disney. We were charged $25...which was a little more than what a cab would have cost. So, be cautious when asking for a cab and if you get the shuttle, get them to tell you the fee before you get into the \"cab\". Food - the hotel offers a breakfast buffet for $7 a person. It was okay...nothing too fancy, but you can load up on fresh fruit (bananas, apples, oranges) to take to the parks with you. There was an omelette making station that looked good too...they also had boxes of cereal included in the buffet. There is not much for dinner choices right at the hotel...they do have Pizza Hut, but not really anything else. Pools - there is no hot tub here but the two main pools (and one small pool) are quite nice. They have a pool bar and lots of lounge chairs with towels available there, so you don't have to use your room towels. \"Discount\" park tickets - Be warned here....you are able to get discounted tickets to the park here, but only if you agree to attend a 90 minute \"Vacation Ownership\" sales presentation offsite. We reluctantly signed up for this and it ended up being not so bad. The \"shuttle\" takes you from the hotel to another resort (Wyndham Golf) about 5 minutes away. You can pick the time to take this \"tour\". You get a free buffet breakfast (which wasn't bad). After you eat, a sales person sits one on one with you to go over their sales pitch. We then got a tour on a golf cart of the property (which was actually a really nice ride outside). We were presented with an offer that we politely turned down and then got two more counter offers which we also turned down. They \"released us\" and we paid for our tickets. The shuttle came back to get us and took us directly to the Magic Kingdom for no charge...and we got there before the shuttle would have gotten us there by. We saved $60 USD total on our tickets, so I think it was worth it, but it's something you need to be aware of. There were A LOT of other people receiving the sales presentation too...so you won't be the only ones there! Overall, this was a really great hotel and we would definitely stay here again. It seemed like a great hotel for kids too. We paid about $200 US for the three night stay. If you are looking for a pleasant hotel with good value, I would highly recommend this one.

We found one way around this and that was to utilize the Disney shuttles to and from the parks, which are free, so you can hop on a shuttle back to the hotel at whatever time you want. Also, restaurants around the hotel are pretty limited unless you want to eat at a buffett. If you are looking for a place like TGI Fridays, Red Lobster, etc. you will be ok because there are a few of them around the area. Overall, the hotel is nice and we did not have anything negative to say about what we received from them.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood base for the parks\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4688748", "Content": "Just come back today from a two week stay at this Hotel.

There is a handy store located next to the hotel where you can pick up a daily paper/develop photos and get any meds that you may need last minute. There is also a good crazy golf course next to the hotel which is worth a visit one evening. The Hotel do a decent breakfast where kids eat free to set you up for the day before you hit the parks. The Hotel was busy while we were there and the majority of those there were from the US which we took as a good sign. Check out times 12pm but if you ask in advance you can keep your room on until 1pm at no extra charge but they only let so many rooms on a daily basis.

I had a king bed, fridge, 2 phones, a desk, safe, broken hairdryer, couch, and color TV with few channels. The bad part about these rooms would be that they are located directly in front of the mini golf. This can be very loud!! (Drinking adults, not kids!!) I had to call for maintainance 1 time. They did respond within 10 minutes. (The TV wouldn't change channels; needed to be reset) And the only major complaint I had was the rate per night that I was quoted on the phone ($55.00 per night) is not what I was charged.

Firstly, Do not look at the website pics and think that the hotel looks like this, this place is a Motel 2, not even a Motel 6! All the outdoor corridors are filthy, do they ever clean the trash cans??? The sidewalks are dirty.. The \"lake \" is ajoke, more like a man made swamp. The rooms are sooo budget, bathroom had cracks, mildew, shabby towels and moldy shower liner. Beds were comfy as were the pillows, but the comforter smelled horrible, I would not even let my mind wander as to what the smell was. The buffet for breakfast which was included in the rate was HORRIBLE! Yes, the selection was great and huge variety, but the bacon was underdone and smelled rancid, everything else was always cold, we even got there when it opened and it still was ice cold. Coffee was horrible. Someimes the servers charged for drinks, sometimes not... They seemed really weary. The shuttle service is you could call it that was horrible, they p/u at strange times and sometimes are an hour late to pick you up from the parks, and Florida is cold at night and with a child, that is unacceptable! The worst shuttle time is to Sea World where you get dropped off nearly 2 hours before the park is open! And the drivers go 30 miles over the speed limit while listening to Metallica! Yikes! But!!! The topper is that I chose this place as a lot of other Orlando hotels have a roach problem and this hotel had no bad reviews about roaches... WELL! On our way to the airport at 4:00a.m. as I was packing up the last bits in my luggage, I had some roaches come out to say \"Goodbye\"! My worst nightmare, I then stressed about bringing them back home, I had slept a whole week with them hanging out... also, all night long you feel biting and itching.. bed bugs perhaps?

The slip road takes you directly onto the US192. Continue on the 192 for about 3 miles. The hotel is within spitting distance of marker 5 ( at its junction with Formosa Gardens ). We had 3 rooms. On booking in the reception desk requested a maid charge of $50 per room. This was politely refused with no questions asked.

Budget but neat and tidy. 2 double beds in each room. Coffee and tea making facilities. An ironing board and hairdryer. An electronic keypad safe which was excellent - type in your own 4 digit code and the doors lock. A bathroom / shower with constant hot water. The room doors are operated with a card. What more could you ask for - we were here to explore, not sit in a hotel room all day. The hotel has a large beakfast area though cheaper / better choice options are available within walking disatance. There is an adequate drinking bar and a pizza hut within the reception block. The reception area is neat and clean and staff were friendly.The 3 pools at the hotel were excellent and extra towels were provided at poolside.

There's a computer room (extra charge) plus ATM (mind you was a bit costly to use). Also there is a phone in your room where you can make FREE local calls. Beware any other calls are a bit pricey. It has a big car park, is ideally placed for the Disney parks (only about 10 mins drive), to other main roads which take you to Tampa, Daytona, Orlando, Space Centre etc. There is a Walgreens chemist/general store next door, a few restaurants, McDonalds, steak, fish and a massive Walmart just 10 mins drive away on Highway 27. If I was to nit pick then just remember to add sales tax 6.5% and that's on everything you buy in Florida plus $3.50 a night resort fee so expect to play about $10 a night more on top of their quoted price ($59 becomes $71).

On our arrival on the 28th October, we could not believe the state of the rooms in Block 6. We were greeted with the damp, musty smell, which was overpowering, water stains and blood stains on the carpet. As we proceeded into the bathroom (if you could call it that) you couldn't turn around in it. It was cramped, the tiles were grubby and the door touched the toilet. The wash area was seperate from the bathroom, with no curtain to divide the room from the sleeping area. The fridge was broken, the control switches for the lights also broken, there was no wardrobe to hang clothes, and the drawers weren't cleaned out properly. The A/C unit made such a racket could not be turned off at the control and had to be unplugged from the socket, the door had been tampered with from a previous time. To top it all the bedding was damp. We had booked the holiday in August 2004 and in our party were 2 elderly relatives with respiratory problems. We couldn't believe our eyes that this hotel was Virgin's flagship hotel, we felt we were given any old room to stay in. I really thought after reading the reviews that the Best Western had turned it self around since it was La Quinta Inn, but how wrong we were. Fortunately, we were offered alternate accommodation from Virgin and had a great stay in the Calypso Cay Country Inn Suites, I would highly recommend this hotel.

There is a Walgreens within 50 yards from the check-in desk. You can get snacks and breakfast foods there also. The hotel offers free miniature golf and there is a themed miniature golf course next door. Shuttle services are limited to once daily (except for Magic Kingdom that has two shuttles).

The bar area was a little lacking in atmosphere but as there was a pool table my boys were fine. The location of the hotel was fine, far enough away from the main road to be quite peaceful but not too far from all the main attractions by car.

My wife and I decided to visit Disney World for a week. We were accustomed to staying at LQ properties on all our out of town stays. We made the reservations in advance on the LQ website at $65/night for govt. rate for LQ Lakeside. I thought this was a little high since it was off-season and a stay at a Disney resort was only $8 more per night. This specific hotel has caused my wife and I to think twice about reserving a LQ hotel in advance without seeing it for ourselves. The hotel\u2019s website(Lakeside) stated the usual free breakfast(as all LQ\u2019s do) included in the price. I called in advance just to make sure of this. Funny thing. I received three responses from three different employees concerning the breakfast. Nobody knew how to tell the truth about what was going on. Apparently, the hotel had decided to charge for their breakfast b/c there is a restaurant located inside the main lobby. I contacted LQ Guest Services to confirm this and was given Rick Adlington\u2019s(Regional VP of LQ) personal cell number. He told my wife and I that all LQ\u2019s were required to offer the free option in order to be given the LQ branding and we would receive coupons for the free option upon arrival. He said the hotel had taken it upon themselves to decide to not offer the free breakfast and it was not approved from the corporate office. I should have known this was the start of a disaster waiting to happen. Now, the room was the icing on the cake. During the entire week, the Lakeside hotel had around 50% occupancy as far as I could tell. You know, the windows are always open and nobody is in the rooms. After all the fighting and run around about the reservations and the breakfasts, you would think the manager of the hotel(Nicole) would be interested in making sure we were happy during our stay. We thought so, too. The sink in our room was \u201cfalling\u201d off the wall. Yes, falling off the wall. It had been propped up to keep it attached to the wall. The room was disgusting and mold/mildew was everywhere. This was certainly not what we were used to in a LQ type hotel. When I requested another room, my request was refused b/c they said the hotel was booked. Think again. I knew they cared very little about our vacation and our happiness. One morning, I found a young passed out in front of one of the rooms. Yes, ! To my surprise, the LQ employee I saw didn\u2019t seem to mind that the was laying there while she calmly prepared a breakfast for some school kids at the poolside less than 20 yards away. I certainly would not have my kids here! To this day, their website still offers the free breakfast at this hotel. You make your own judgement. Some reviews say nice value. Ask yourself if LQ is really providing me a value by staying at an old, falling down hotel versus staying at a better property for the same money? Is it worth it to you to pay over $60/night off-site of Disney when these people don\u2019t provide true customer service? I ought to know. I am a customer service manager myself.

There was plenty of choice of restaurants near by and although the breakfast in the hotel was reasonable there was some good alternatives within a very short walk if you fancied a change (we too had the free continental breakfast taken away after 3 days without explanation but too be honest it was an added bonus it was there as we hadn't expected it!) The transport was good although we had one or two occasions where there appeared to be too many people waiting to get on to the bus (I think they were busier than expected due to rearranged holidays as a result of the hurricanes) We had a great time - the hotel was just what we needed and we would consider returning to La Quinta if we went to Florida again.", "Date": "October 25, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2703074", "Content": "Nice value.

Another room (despite being designated a non-smoking room) stank of cigarette or cigar smoke. 3. A third room had the air-con system stuck on maximum power, which could only be quietened by unplugging the whole unit. This left us with a choice of being deafened or baking.

Even the restaurants on-site, such as Pizza Hut & Hurricane Sams were just fine and the kids eat for free. The 5 pools were well maintained and the mini golf course was alot of fun. The shuttles ran on time, but the buses are rather old and be prepared to stand at days end coming back from the theme parks. As for the rooms, carpets were stained in spots and the room was a little dated, but were well-kept and clean(we were in Orlando, so how much time do you really spend in the room anyways?). The in-room safe was great too. If you are looking for a property with VALUE at a reasonable cost, I highly recommend.

If you are an early bird then go for the bottom floor and let the other get a bit more rest. The breakfast was terrific. We paid in advance and it was great to have that expense taken care of. I could have done without the timeshare salespersons who are selling \"discounted\" park tickets. The pool and pool bar were very nice and the room was adequately clean. The grounds just okay.

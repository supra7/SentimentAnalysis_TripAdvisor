The rooms were not ready upon our arrival and the key would not work to open the door of one of the rooms. We had to access both rooms through one. Because of this, we were told we would get a credit back on our credit card. After 2 weeks and no credit, I called the hotel and was told they did credit me. After much discussion, they told me to call Orbitz which I did. When the gentleman from Orbitz Customer Service contacted the hotel, he was told we stayed 2 nights and only paid for one, therefore there would be no credit. That was an out and out lie and not appreciated at all. The credit is not the issue here but I am outraged that they can accuse someone of doing that. The Orbitz customer service representative was wonderful, calling the hotel back, running interference, and finally securing half the discount. We will never stay at that hotel again. They certainly have NO integrity.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cnot bad\u201d", "Author": "Danny L", "ReviewID": "UR133941462", "Content": "not bad for the price the hotel is old but it is clean the rooms and beds are clean the breakfast is a joke but other than that would stay here aginb for the races just a short 2.5 mile walk to the speedway. just take it as it is a economy stay hotel and you will be happy there is alot worse out there trust me.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBed bugs in the room.\u201d", "Author": "StayingAround", "ReviewID": "UR129594067", "Content": "Mattress stains, looks like urine, and bed bugs.

For the February and July Daytona races, availability of affordable rooms near the track is limited. But this motel is THE most poorly maintained structure, let alone paid accomodation, we've ever experienced. First, there was a single lock on the door that, when turned, allowed it to swing wide open. It appeared the prior lock had been broken for quite some time. And the chain --a plastic zip tie. As this room was on the first floor only steps away from the parking lot (where some fans who had a little too much to drink were physically fighting) safety was a concern. We moved the table in front of the door just in case.. The plastic cover for the outlet below the AC was broken off, and we thought that plugging it in may start an electrical fire. The shower and shower curtain were covered in mold, even more so than you would expect in this type of hotel. The drywall and ceiling..use your imagination. Bottom line is that lack of availability and price gouging of area hotels make this location an attractive choice, but the cost you save isn't worth the risk. We couldn't wait to leave, and I think we would have felt safer sleeping in our car at a nearby truck stop.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe Smelly, Damp, and plain Ugly\u201d", "Author": "Superstarr12", "ReviewID": "UR115510889", "Content": "First off we should have stayed the extra night at the LaPlaya Resort.

When I first entered the room I was overwhelmed with this smell of mold, damp carpet, pets, and cigarette smoke. After I made several attempts to get a refund the front desk staff (Ms. Kelly whom was very helpful**) restated the company policy but opted to switch rooms. So, we switch to rooms and I went to the local Walgreens to get some stick ups and sleep aid. The next day we didn\u2019t even bother with the continental breakfast we wanted out first thing.

Electric switch plates were filthy with grime and built-up dust; walls were dirty; poor vacuuming exposes built-up dirt and dust in corners of the room. All in all, disgraceful housekeeping that shows an obvious pattern of neglect. When a fuse blew and the tv and my laptop were disconnected, they gave me another room, which wasn't much better.

I called the day before to check availability and was advised the motel had plenty of rooms available. Which is common for off season in Daytona Beach. I also placed a call 2 hours before arriving at the hotel to make sure they had a room with a refrigerator available. I was told they had one room left with a king sized bed and a refrigerator. The woman at the front desk took my name and advised me she was holding the room for me. When we arrived they not only had no rooms what so ever with a king sized bed but the room they ended up giving us was unable to recieve WIFI the t.v. did not work at all and it was at the very end and back of the hotel. There were people hanging out in front of their rooms ( most likely a drug dealer ) and the man at the front desk ended up moving us up 2 rooms to a room that he couldn't get unlocked. Upon entering this room we realized this t.v. also did not work properly. This would have been because they were all jerry rigged. All and all I would say that this hotel has went totally down the crapper. I am a local to Daytona Beach and we have many crappy crack hotels....I believe this one has joined the ranks. I would also not have even stayed here if I would have been alone. I would not have been comfortable at all. Dont waste the money coming to this particular super 8 I'm sure the ones on beachside would have been closely comparable money wise.

The next morning the cleaning lady knocked on our door blaming us for the problem. I went to alert the front desk and he informed because of the earlier situation she had been fired and that is why she was mad. I certainly did not think it was her fault but I guess that was their policy. I was not credited for any of this, I guess the clerk assumed I took solice it the lady being fired which I did not because I think she was unaware of the situation and it was just overlooked.

The beds, drapes, carpet, paint, and furniture all appeared in excellent condition. Never saw the first insect and towels were plentiful and new. Bike week is an overcrowded, hectic time for hotel personnel. From our perspective, they seemed to be totally on top of all issues. The only minor disappointment was the lack of a refrigerator or microwave or clock, which the online hotel site indicated were in each room. Perhaps that will be remedied as the renovations continue.

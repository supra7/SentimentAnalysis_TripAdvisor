Seemed like a good hotel for a reasonable price. The froint desk staff seemed polite and accomodating. Little did I know that when I woke up after the first night, there was blood on my sheets and two bed bugs were crawing around. Now, a couple of days later, I have welps on my arms, neck, and ankles. They did refund the unsed portion of my reservation, but I still had to pay for the night that I was a feast to these critters. This is GROSS!

The room was clean and had enough space. The staff were incredibly helpful and delightful. The one big problem is the noise, the trains seemed to run until gone 11 and started up at around 8 am. It is not just the train going along the line they seem to toot their horn every time they go by the hotel as it sounds like there is a crossing and they warn people they are coming. It sounded like the train was about to enter our room it was that loud. Then you have the noise as people walk down the corridor, the walls are incredibly thin and you can hear suitcases being pulled along and people talking in the corridor. The breakfast was well stocked and maintained by the gentleman on the desk, there is limited space so the bacon and eggs are microwaved but there are lots of choices including a waffle machine. If you can cope with the noise then a perfectly pleasant hotel for the money but not for me. I would say don't leave your name and address if you make a comment on the comment card in the room, I went to leave a comment on the card only to discover that someone had completed it in march and it had still been sitting there in September, they obviously do not value their customers comments, thankfully that person had not left their address but it would be a little worrying if they had.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wuustwezel, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cFriendly hosts, rooms OK.

Checkin was fast and flawless. I needed to print our tickets to Six Flags on their computer, no problem! The rooms are of decent size and clean. Unfortunately it wasn't possible to make it dark enough for us, and there were lots of people running around at night, cheering and yelling (Nothing the hotel can do about). Breakfast was OK, but the breakfast room was too small, so we had to take ours to the room. Pool area was nice, with a (cold!) larger pool, and a hot spa. The railroad is closeby, so be prepared to hear some trains pass by regularly. There are lots of shops & restaurants within close range as well.

I stayed in the second one they offered because the smell wasn't as bad, and it was late and I was tired. But they have no signs or anything in the room to warn people not to smoke. And, there are ash trays and cigarette butts everywhere on the premises. If you are a non-smoker, bad place. I tried using my laptop with their wireless in my room, in the lobby, and then hooked up with a WAN cable in my room. It didn't work, they told me another Apple Mac user was having same problem. If you are a smoker with a PC, this place will work fine. if you are a non-smoker and / or have a Mac, and need to be online and to breathe, this is the wrong place. They were extremely nice, apologetic, and gave me a steeply discounted rate when I told them about the problem. So they have a good attitude and mean well. But non-smoking isn't a matter of degrees, it either is or it isn't.

Worst hotel stay ever. Parking is limited, small, and inadequate. If you are unable to get a spot you have to either park infront of the liquor store next door or the office complex with the lot hidden by large shrubs. We were given room 119 which welcomed us with an odor similar to urine and a bathroom with a softball size hole about the shower that collapsed into the tub and the smell of mold. Front desk responded with \u201cokay\u201d and didn\u2019t look like they cared. The second, and last room available, was not cleaned well. We flipped the pillow cases inside out to find yellow spots and blood stains on one of the pillows. Room was loud and we could hear everything and a smoke detector beeped all night from low batteries. Original reservation was for two nights but we cancelled second night in morning. Checkout was a hassle. I was first charged for the original price I had booked the room ($99 a night) and once I was handed the receipt I told the employees there was supposed to be a note in my account saying I was being charged $84. It took two staff members to figure out how to reverse the transaction and charge me the right amount.

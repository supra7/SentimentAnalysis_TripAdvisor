I arrived at around 2 PM and was able to check in and get in my room right away, which was nice. Beds and pillows were comfy and the size of the room was adequate. We also had a nice outdoor balcony where we could sit and enjoy the sun. My only complaint was the shower made a weird squealing noise that was quite annoying. Also, on 2 nights when my roommate and I went to get a soda out of the 9th floor vending machine, the machine was completely sold out. Since I was not in Orlando to sightsee and you rarely leave your hotel anyway during a business conference, the location was convenient. We ate at McCoy\u2019s two nights (food was very good and reasonably priced), the Lobby Bar made some nice strong drinks, and you could order off a limited menu (apps were tasty). Another benefit of having a conference here was that we could venture into the airport to get a bite to eat at the food court or sit-down restaurants so there was a wide selection of food and price ranges. I went to the pool area to see it and it looked nice. I saw a bunch of sunbathers but no one in the pool. Overall a good hotel. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d want to stay there for a vacation, but for an overnight before or after a flight or for a conference, it is a good choice.

Absolutely wonderful. We've stayed at this luxury hotel several times over the years and it is still a great place. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. We had a little balcony to get a glimpse of the Floridian landscape. I love to watch the airport comings and goings from that balcony. There is an abundance of comfortable seats in their huge lobby/lounge area. We had a small bit to eat in their McCoys restaurant and then early to bed. Next morning we was up very early, so after a quick coffee in our room we went over to the car rental office to pick up our hire car. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling long haul as it gives you a nice relaxing place to chill out before you start your trip.

You can access the Internet to print out your boarding pass for free in the lobby. There's a very good selection of recent movies for rent although they are very expensive. Toileteries are of good quality with even toothpaste provided. I had a room facing onto the interior of the airport terminal and there was some noise from there during the night if you are a light sleeper. The gym is well equipped if a bit cramped. You can go running on the helipad with a view of the airport. The pool is small but also overlooks the airport tarmac. Food is very good, with lots of fresh, healthy choices. Even during my three day meeting, the snacks served were healthy. The one negative is that while room service is very quick, if very pricey, it takes them ages to collect the trays and trolleys (all night) even after you call to remind them that your trolley is standing outside your door.

For early flights especially, it's super convenient and you don't have to worry about over-sleeping as the hotel provides personalized (not recorded) wake-up calls, and even provides a follow-up call 15 minutes later to make sure you're up. That coupled with the fancy alarm clock and 2 alarm settings, and you can rest assured you won't over-sleep. The hotel itself is outstanding and room furnishings and decor are first class. I've had both an inside-facing terminal room and runway-facing room, and they are both extremely comfortable (bed has loads of pillows!) and soundproof. The inside facing terminal rooms have a balcony overlooking the terminal (great for people watching and seeing how long the security line is), while the runway view rooms have a balcony where you can watch planes soaring off. The bed is SO comfortable and there are actually too many pillows to realistically use! The staff is excellent and very professional. The bathroom has a combined tub and shower, and the shower head is very nice, offering a nice pressure stream of water. The bath amenities are very good, as well as the over-size towels. There is a coffee maker in the room with Starbucks coffee. The flat panel TV has a couple channels showing arrivals and departures (as well as the regular channels) for checking flights, or just dreaming about the next place you want to go. The airport location can't be beat if you're flying out early or arriving late. For late arriving passengers (or even those folks waiting on other's flights to arrive), there is a restaurant and bar on the lobby level, which is open until at least midnight. This was really a much appreciated feature after I arrived back at 10pm one time and could still get a meal and a drink. There is another hotel restaurant located on another level, however I have not used that one so can't comment. There is a fancy outdoor pool with waterfall, and there is plenty of lounge seating as well. This area offers great views of the runway and terminal trains (some people call them monorails, but these are not) which transport passengers to their gates. Surprisingly there is not a pool bar here for this nice area, although there is a house phone with a number to call for room service delivery to the pool. If you have a car, the charge for self parking is $12 (valet available), and the parking garage is conveniently connected to the hotel entrance and lobby. (The regular garage rate is $17 a day for non-guests). After check-in, keep your room key out, as you will need it to take the glass-enclosed elevators (overlooking the terminal) up to your room. The room key is required for guests (for all room types) to use the elevators (at least going up), and adds a nice feeling of security.

It was better than average but not especially great. The service was good (typical for Hyatt) and generally short lines at the front desk. People were well trained, helpful, and friendly. The hotel is over the main terminal of the Orlando airport, so just a short walk from the food court and a couple floors above the baggage claim. The room I had was on the west side of the building with a patio/windows looking out into the public atrium and the entrance to the TSA security lines. In other words, on the opposite side of the building as the elevators so there was little hallway traffic but it was a long walk to get there (especially with luggage after a flight). It seems the rooms closer to the elevator are priced slightly higher on a per night basis. The \"runway view rooms\" are some of the ones closest to the elevators. The rooms themselves were as advertised, not overly large, but not tiny either. I don't think anything was outright broken, but lots of things seemed heavily worn and ready for a refinish, reupholstering, or replacement. Unfortunately, this also seems somewhat typical for a Hyatt. The bathroom was upscale but reeked of the overly perfumed toiletries that Hyatt uses. I am not sure why they thing their soaps and shampoos should smell like the inside of an Asian spice market, but they do. Yes, this sets them apart from their competition, but in a bad way. Some noise did leak into the room. It was noticeable, but not bad. There is a full service restaurant, named McCoy's, near the lobby. The food is pretty good, but overpriced. The service was good, and better than in most tourist areas. There was a significant variety on the menu and the hours of service were long to accommodate travelers including those from different time zones and getting off (or on) to long flights.

Our plane landed at approximately 8:15pm so we were exhausted. We were so glad that the hotel was right inside the terminal. All we had to do was collect our luggage, wheel it to the 3rd floor, go up the elevator and then walk right into the hotel lobby. We were cordially greeted by both the bellboy and the front desk and immediately shown to our room that was located on the 8th floor overlooking the inside of the terminal. The room contained 2 medium firm double beds and a small balcony (sits 2 very comfortably) and was of modern decor with a flat screen 32\" TV (no hdmi to plug in a laptop to watch your own movies - it had the red/white inputs). More importantly, everything was very clean...from the crisp sheets on the bed to the towels hanging in the bathroom. No mold in the bathtub, no dampness in sheets or in the air. The walls and ceiling were flat clean drywall. Not the awful popcorn type ceilings and walls you find in a lot of accommodations in Florida and in the Bahamas. We had no problems with noise where we were located...no noise from planes landing or taking off...no noise from within the terminal. In fact even the air conditioning was quiet. You will get a good night sleep here. You can choose to eat at the hotel restaurant (nice but pricey) or go for a short walk downstairs in the terminal food court where you will find a McDonalds, Quiznos, Starbucks, etc. The following morning we went for a tour of the outdoor pool located on the 6th floor (I will request to stay in a room located on this floor next time) overlooking the runway. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a large pool but its nice just the same. You can choose to sit under the good size wood gazebo or take a dip in the heated pool. I wish we had stayed an extra night to enjoy this floor that also included a fitness room. Since we already paid for Disney transportation, the Hyatt assisted in the luggage delivery to the Disney ship. All we had to do was place the hotel-supplied tags on our luggage, leave them inside our room by the door and check out of the hotel (check in time is 4:00PM and Check out is 12:00PM). It was very simple and the luggage showed up outside our ship cabin door. We waited until 11:30PM to check out since boarding was at 1:00PM. The distance from the hotel to the port is approximately 50 minutes. We figured it would probably take another 30 minutes to process papers at the dock. We were told that there was nothing to do at the dock so we tried to maximize our stay. You will really like the accommodations, friendliness, and convenience of this hotel if you need to stay somewhere prior to a cruise.

Maybe not a problem if you are staying for personal, but when on a business trip, having shampoo in your hair and nothing but cold water is a dealbreaker (further confirmed by coworkers also staying in the hotel).

But the LOCATION of our room was near a party room, across from a \"staff only\" room and the ice machine. After the party was over the staff began to scoot furniture across the floor from one area to the other, go in and out the staff only room and slam doors and talk loudly. Impossible to sleep, I called the front desk to find out what was going on and he sent security to check it out. Obviously, not a problem because the noise continued. I got dressed and went into the hall to check out the situation and called the desk again to let them know what was going on. At 2 A.M. the manager came to help US MOVE from the noise, so we could get 4 hours sleep. RELOCATION. This room should be blocked during events that require such movement and cleaning unless there are no other rooms available, which was not the case. Sad to say all of this could have been prevented had someone put a little more thought into room assignments and party times. I hope this will prevent others from the same experience.

Once I switched my room to the other side of the complex, not much noise could be heard and it was much more comfortable. Service: Good service overall as my room switch was handled without a hitch. The bellman brought the key up to my room within 5 minutes of my request. Free internet if you are a Hyatt elite member but otherwise charges are applicable. Parking: You park your car at one of the airport's short term parking garage which is no more than 3 minutes on foot to the hotel. The cost was $12 per day with unlimited in/out. Gym: Lots of equipment but they were clustered quite tightly together. The TV on the treadmill was unwatchable due to the vibration once I started running. The A/C is too stuffy in the gym. There is also a pool which I did not use. Value: Stayed there on a Sunday night so it was just $90. For a weekday, it probably would be worth $150 to $180. Anything more and you might consider staying elsewhere beyond the airport. I was disappointed that the hotel did not have a Regency Club though as I would have been able to get a free upgrade.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cThe Night Before Hurricane IRENE!\u201d", "Author": "IrvineBeary", "ReviewID": "UR120635201", "Content": "After our stay at the SWAN hotel, we had a very earlymorning fight up to Philly and decided to stay at the Airport Hyatt for the night before the trip.

It's especially hard if you're physically challenged, or you've got a bunch of cumbersome luggage to drag along, or maybe just plain tired, However, it wasn't enough of a problem to not want to stay there again.

There is nothing negative that I would say about our experience. First of all, the hotel is conveniently located if you are planning to get to Port Canaveral to board a cruise ship. The drive from the hotel to the port is about 35 minutes and its a simple easy drive, we would stay here every time we were headed for the port. Second, the hotel is literally INSIDE the Orlando airport and this offers an experience that is very unique. You can only access the elevators with your room key so the hotel does offer some seperation from the airport traffic. You can go into the airport terminal though, via the elevator or escalators. This means that you have access to all of the great airport features (shops, arcade, food court) without having the headache of actually traveling through the airport. The rooms in the hotel are very modern, very clean and equipped with some great features such as makeup mirrors, full size hair dryers, a great flat screen TV, alarm clock that has an iPhone/iPod dock, coffee pot and travel coffee cups. Plus, most rooms have a really great balcony that allows you to step out and see into the airport terminal. There is a great rooftop pool and sitting area that allows you to watch the planes take off and land. There are severl great restaurants on site as well as a bar and there are drink specials/room service offered in the pool area. The only tip I can offer is around parking. We really didnt know what we were getting into with the parking. You access the hotel via the airport so the parking garage also houses airport traffic. Follow the signs for the Hyatt and youll find the specific garage area for them. You will take a parking ticket like anyone else, but when you speak to the front desk, they will offer your details on how to reduce that parking fee.

If convenience alone were the criterion on which the Hyatt Recency at Orlando airport is to be judged, then you couldn't ask for more--it's RIGHT INSIDE the airport, and you literally step out of the hotel right in front of the security checkpoints. But even putting the convenience aside, this is actually a really nice hotel, at a very reasonable price. The guest rooms are on the 5th through 9th floors of the airport, and they encircle main terminal area, so that the terminal itself serves as an atrium for the hotel. Interior rooms face the main terminal below, the others face the airport runways. All are reasonably quiet, despite the airport location. The rooms are modern, spacious, and nicely furnished, as is usually the case with Hyatt Regency properties. The bed, bedding, and HVAC system are all designed for maximum comfort and sleep quality. There is free wi-fi internet access (provided by the airport itself, not by the hotel--the hotel provides wired access for a fee). The staff is very friendly and accomodating. There are two restaurants on-site (I didn't try them, but the menus did look appealing, though as is usually the case with hotel restaurants they were a bit pricey ) and a couple of bars (including a poolside lounge), plus the typical range of airport restaurants, shops, and services in the main terminal downstairs. Even if you don't plan on going swimming (and I didn't, because the weather was bad during both of my recent one-night stays), be sure to check out the rooftop pool area. It is one of those beautiful , artistic pools that is filled to the brim and the the water constantly overflows the top and and is recirculated (the kind you see pictured in stories about those super-luxurious world-class resorts that cater to the rich and famous). You ordinarily don't see that sort of thing in hotels in this modest price range (and that price range, during my stays, was about $130 a night). To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Orlando as a city and typically haven't enjoyed my stays there, so I certainly wasn't expecting much out of an AIRPORT hotel in Orlando. What a pleasant surprise.

On our last trip we decided to see how effective staying right at the airport would be. We loved it. Now I wished every airport we ever used was located right in the airport. It was exceptionally convenient to dress, call a bell hop and go directly to luggage drop. There were no worries about a flat tire delaying our drive to the airport. We did not even have to worry about managing all of our luggage. The Hyatt lives up to the standards of a good four star hotel. The rooms are spacious. The beds were exceptionally comfortable, and the pillows were outstanding. The linens were high quality. The glasses were made from heavy, well-weighted glass and the amenities were excellent. We requested, and received a room overlooking the inside of the airport. We could stand on our balcony and watch passengers hurrying to security lines. We did not eat at the hotel because both restaurants were more expensive than we wished to pay for a hotel meal. There are plenty of dining options in the airport itself. We opted for the Macaroni Grill. I cannot say enough good things about the service. When we arrived a bell man greeted us, loaded up our luggage and told us he would deliver it to our room. Check-in was quick and painless. When our luggage arrived the bell man identified us by our names, as did every other employee we encountered in the hotel. I really appreciated the assistance with the luggage, and when it was delivered the man asked for the time of our departure and told us he would make sure someone came and picked it up and took it to luggage check-in. This happened very smoothly. In addition to a generous tip for luggage service, the hotel also has a charge for luggage delivered to the luggage drop of the airport, but it was only $10, and that is no more than I pay when I do curbside check-in. Of course, the tip to the bell man was more, but it was really worth it. Our balcony had not been cleaned when we arrived in our room. A quick call to housekeeping produced someone who cleaned it quickly, and wished us well using our name. I had two unique issues with this hotel. My first issue was with the hot water. I had planned on a long bath before bed. When I got into the tub the water was only tepid. I let it run for a long time, and the temperature did not improve. A call to the front desk revealed that a water heater was not functioning. I checked it occasionally through out the night. Hot water was not available until 6am. We mentioned this problem when we checked out, and received a fair compensation for the inconvenience. My second problem was a bit more serious. When I received my bank statement the room charge was accurately subtracted, but there was an additional charge for $70.58. A call to the hotel revealed that this charge was for a lunch eaten in the hotel three days after we checked out. I was a little disturbed by the fact that it seemed like the hotel could so easily charge this meal to our portfolio, which should have indicated that we had left long before this lunch. The lady that managed this issue was not particularly polite. After several assurances that we did not eat at the hotel three days after we left, I offered to produce our boarding passes. I really did not think it was my obligation to prove I was innocent of the charges. Eventually she agreed to credit our account, but she was not happy. I asked her how something like this could happen, and she said it happens all of the time. She said guests often charge meals to their rooms, but they forget their room numbers and charges often go to the wrong guest. She did not have a good explanation for why they would charge something to a portfolio that indicated the guests had been gone for three days. I was quite concerned because she said this situation happens \"all the time\". This problem was not sufficient to prevent us from making reservations for a trip we are taking soon, but I will be watching my credit card account online to make sure that no additional charges appear after we have checked out. This would be my suggestion to any other guest staying at this hotel. Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience at the Hyatt located in the airport, and we will certainly return.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNot a brilliant stay\u201d", "Author": "vancouverpatel", "ReviewID": "UR118129893", "Content": "I had booked 2 rooms and had confirmed the number of people in each group and was shocked when the group of 3 were given a room with one King size bed!

I could not believe what I was hearing and decided to talk to the Conceirge, who was a really professional lady by the name of Heerena. She listened patiently to me while I told her that its absurd that bookings made via a travel agent does not provide a bed per person!

Now, for my detailed review: First, I need to preface this review by stating that it builds upon my detailed prior review of this property. I have posted one prior review of this property, and the service continues to exceed my expectations! Please see that prior review for further information on this property: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An absolutely amazing start to my honeymoon! A perfect honeymoon stay!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - September 11, 2011 My wife and I have previously stayed at this property twice, the last time being the start to our honeymoon. As we approached our one-year anniversary and had an early flight out to Jamaica, we could think of no better place to kick off our anniversary trip! And, true to my prior experiences, the Hyatt Regency Orlando International Airport continued to far exceed my expectations! For those who do not know much about this property, it is actually located within the Atrium area of the Orlando International Airport -- conveniently located above a main TSA Security Checkpoint. The lobby is located on the 4th Floor of the airport, with convenient access directly into the airport's Terminal Top Parking Garage -- allowing for quick and easy park and fly ability. As for parking, this property has 4 and 7-day \"Park and Fly\" rates that can be booked to allow one to stay for one night prior to his or her trip yet park for the entire trip. Additionally, should you not wish to pay for such a rate, the hotel does offer discounted parking for the period that you are actually staying. Guests have a choice of Valet of Self Park in the Terminal Top Garage, and rates are quite economical. For your nights actually at the Hyatt, Self Parking is $12/day and Valet is $16/day; for nights subsequent to your stay, you will be charged the normal airport rate of $17/day for Self Parking or $25/day for Valet Parking. Compared to most airports, this is a very economical option, and I highly suggest actually parking at the airport. Upon check-in, you will be given a \"Parking Exit Pass\" to show to the Parking Agent so that your rates can be charged accordingly. This option worked perfectly for us, and very easily exited the garage with the first night's parking properly discounted without issue. One tip -- if at all possible, try to park on Level 4 of the Terminal Top Garage, as that is the floor with direct access to the Hyatt. After we had parked, we were able to enter the Hyatt's beautiful main lobby quickly, and check-in was, as always, extremely polite and efficient. We were greeted by name, and the Front Desk Agent immediately wished us \"Happy Anniversary.\" The level of customer service at this property is truly top-notch, and repeat guests are always warmly welcomed back by name. She checked us in extremely quickly and kindly, and within a matter of minutes, we were relaxing in our VIP Suite for the night. If you have read my prior review, you saw a detailed description of a VIP Suite at this property. This VIP Suite, however, was slightly different -- and, in fact, I much preferred this room. We had been assigned room 6121, and it was located in the perfect location -- on the 6th floor, directly adjacent to the swimming pool, and extremely close to the StayFit Gym. As you walk into the room, you enter into a beautifully decorated dining area, with a large dining table, perfectly suited for in-room dining. However, the thing that most caught my eye upon entering the room was the bathroom -- this VIP Suite has one of the most amazing bathrooms that I have seen! It is located immediately to your right upon entry into the room, and the first thing one will notice is the massive whirlpool bathtub. Large steps allow one entry into this huge tub, perfectly suited to handle more than one person comfortably. There is also an extremely large glass shower, a beautiful vanity and dressing area, along with a toilet area and a second sink. This definitely surprised me, as I had no idea that this property had such lavish bathrooms available! But, it was not just the bathroom -- this room truly was amazing. As you continue into the room from the dining area, you enter a large sitting area with extremely comfortable couches and a large HD-television. This room is partially separated by a divider wall to the bedroom area, which features an extremely comfortable Hyatt Grand Bed, a chair and ottoman, and a work desk with wired internet port. Then, both the bedroom and the sitting room have separate balconies, which offer plush and comfortable lounge chairs to sit out and get some sun while allowing for a beautiful view of the runways. And, in case you are worried about noise, this property is sound-proofed extremely well, and when inside the room, we were unable to hear any plane noise. All in all, an extremely beautiful room that allowed for a wonderfully relaxing evening to start our anniversary trip. As for dining on property, the Hyatt Regency Orlando International Airport offers a number of dining options -- we opted for a romantic room service dinner. I must say, the room service food was excellent! The food was extremely delicious, and the service was amazing. Food arrived quickly and was still piping hot. I would highly recommend utilizing room service at this property, as it is some of the best room service around! And, in addition to our room service dinner, I had requested my Diamond Amenity as a food option, and I promptly received a bottle of Merlot and the cookies and chocolate, which served as a truly perfect dessert to an excellent dinner! But, on top of that, the General Manager sent us a bottle of champagne and some heavenly chocolate covered strawberries in recognition of our anniversary. Such amazing customer service is common place at this property, which is why it is not to be missed! Especially as this property offers some truly high quality Diamond Amenity choices to loyal Diamond Level Members of the Hyatt Gold Passport Program. One final word about dining, this property offers and excellent breakfast at Hemispheres, located on the 9th Floor. There is a wonderful buffet, along with the typical Hyatt breakfast menu. Service is excellent, and the runway views are beautiful. It truly is a great breakfast -- and, there are many rate options under which this breakfast is included, so keep a look out. All-in-all, the Hyatt Regency Orlando International Airport is a truly wonderful property in the perfect location, with customer service that continues to excel with each visit. If you need a place to stay before or after a flight, this is one property that you definitely must not miss!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cSoooooo Convenient\u201d", "Author": "OcalaGator", "ReviewID": "UR116204468", "Content": "If you are flying from Orlando International Airport park at \"Fast Park and Relax\" stay overnight at the Hyatt Orlando International Airport.

That is $5 less than normal airport parking, but still pretty steep. Be sure to ask the front desk for a parking voucher to use on your way out. The signs for parking are not very clear. They also have valet parking if you continue past the sign for the hotel parking, you will see the valet parking just ahead. The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are great with a separate shower and bath and two sink areas. Our room also had a fridge which was great. The hotel itself does not offer internet because the airport has free wifi (which may not work on all floors). We booked through AAA so our room came with free breakfast for 2 (although we are a family of 4). They have a great breakfast buffet open from 6:30-noon. We ate dinner one night in their restaurant on the lobby level. The food was good and I loved that they offer a tapas menu where you can select 3 items for $16.95. Yum!

Also discovered there was not a room service menu or information book in the room. Ended up having dinner at McCoy's Bar & Grill which was OK but nothing special for the price & service was not up to par!

Overall: The reason we returned was precisely because the Hyatt sits atop Orlando/MCO Airport. Hugely convenient! Sixty seconds and you are in the A/P. It's got two good restaurants, a rooftop pool (with bar and bar-menu service), and an excellent fitness center. No WiFI here in this room on the ninth floor. It's too far from the free MCO Airport WiFi. So my option was to pay for it. I realized then that it would have been nicer to have the same kind of room on one of the balcony rooms that overlooks the pool (which is on a piece of the roof of the sixth floor) or that overlooks the inside of the airport. We didn't call the person assigned t me as a Passport member. My mistake; the front desk was this nice guy who would have moved me if I asked. So moving on... I had movies DLed from PB on my hard-drive, so I figured we'd watch them on the laptop. This is a very insulated building and is very quiet! Kids were screaming in the atrium outside our door around 10:00 PM, but that's a clientele problem that the hotel also suffers with, like we did. Otherwise, a very good room. I got it free on my Hyatt Passport (from staying in the Hollywood and Mexico Hyatts). We got two drinks each (two Sam Adams and two bloody marys) at the pool: 42 bucks, and I added a couple more bucks, even though a 6 dollar tip already had been added. Expensive, but it's travel, right? We want to make the most of the non-business times, i.e., the evenings. What always surprises me at Hyatt is how they think they're catering to \"business\" travelers with expensive and archaic technology/media. For instance, our room had three landlines--two within reach of each other in the room and one in the WC, which always makes me think of the 1980s and yuppies. One would be needed for intra-hotel calls. Who, I wonder, doesn't use his/her cell primarily? Then they drop the paper version of the Wall Street Journal at the door in the morning, which is to say they think I want to read some day-old Rupert Murdoch ideology that I can access easy enough online, \"IF\" I had WiFi. I'll bet most of their business travelers don't use either the landlines or read the newspapers. Why not put the things we need in the rooms? How about a plug/outlet thing for our devices on the desk and get rid of the stationary--like I'm gonna write a card to someone??? Having access to a monitor and basic sound-system, which could be primarily for the shrinking pool of cable-viewing old folks and families, would allow those of us in the current tech/media ecology to be productive during our stay. Run-of-the-mill, i.e., your current and regular business visitors are going to be new-tech-connected business visitors (80% of their trade). They will have AV, HDMI, and VGA adaptors and cords. And they won't opt for the wired (i.e., obsolete) connection that is ten bucks a day (i.e., rip-off!) Probably only about 20% of their trade has pad-able travel expense accounts and pay 10 bucks a day for WiFi. I'm talking to you, Hyatt Central: We need WiFi in every room at every Hyatt because that's what we use for business. I'm out of touch, laptop-wise, when I stay at a Hyatt. All I have is my phone for a connection to my work. Here at Orlando, they need to insure that every room gets free MCO WiFi, and where it isn't available, take care of the problem, but not by charging some rooms when others get it free!!! A nice surprise was to see that the room's television monitor would easily accept an HDMI cord, so that was a plus. I mean, come on, I'm going to be honest here. I might want to UL or DL a movie from PB and then out-port it to the monitor to watch later. Generally, I'm not going to pay for content when I can get it for free, especially when Hyatt charges ten bucks per PPV. This next one is looking toward the future, but some hotels might want to think about culling back their cable choices. Again: ideology, People!!!! Don't be such an obvious tool of the right, Hyatt!!!! I don't need Fox Business Channel! Like I want to watch people who know less about the market than I do. And you can start seeing how many visitors actually want the rest of the angry-scream-athon channels that parade as news, fact-free opinions, and waste-of-time information. Help me here, Hyatt. Get me connected and dump the 1980s' business amenities. Help me get my work done when I stay with you, and to do that, you need to get on top of the tech problem you're getting swallowed by. Doubletrees all offer free WiFi, but they are not as nice as Hyatts. That's one thing I think about when I book hotels. HIltons are like you: still offering old-people business amenities. You've got style in your rooms and public spaces (not so much here, but generally speaking Hyatts are pretty upscale and stylish). Now why don't you put what we need in the rooms so that staying there offers us the same tech/media amenities as home? Otherwise, very comfortable king mattress, great linens on the bed, although the bath towels were a bit worn, and amenities were all as good as we would use at home: our standard for assessment. Their channel 5, I think it is, shows a marketing loop of Hyatt hotels and resorts, and there was something wrong with it all evening: it kept repeating every ten seconds. Now I know that Hyatt can do better because in the Cancun, Mexico, Hyatt there were three or so 20-minute loops, and the music was just right on them, so we actually watched them voluntarily to check out the visuals for some other Hyatt properties. Orlando lost a valuable opportunity to showcase other Hyatt properties to us last night. But technology, as in Mexico--where the WiFi needs to be free and strong since cell phone and data plan coverage costs US travelers extra--is not Hyatt's forte. They need to get the same tech emphasis that they are showing in their decor. One final note: the pool is in terrible shape: the liner is literally coming up throughout the whole pool (Hello, Property Manager! Get on this pronto! It's potentially dangerous for children!!!), the place out there needs a coat of paint and some renovations, too, and they play music from the 1980s, which, after seeing the 1980s' tech/media in the rooms, makes me wonder if someone with some ironic self-awareness was making a subtle joke. Another joke is how both restaurants, which are nice (except for having like zero vegetarian entrees!!!) subject diners to an unwanted survey by the hostess. Both restaurants need to seat diners immediately, not subject them to questions about my name and room number--I'm staying there; figure it out when I charge it to my room! This happened a year ago last January, when we stayed there before. The front desk guy pitched a reservation at the restaurant, which we could see was not packed, at check-in, when we were only interested in getting the bags into the room and planning out our next stage of the day. Hello! I'm staying here, it's the airport, you've got to be kidding if you think I'm going to go down and thru TSA to eat. Last year, on the next morning, we went to the ninth floor Hemisphere Restaurant, where the view is great and the buffet is quite good but overpriced, and before we were brought to a table, we were questioned, while the answers were written in pencil, for what I can only imagine is some corporate assessment: \"Name? How do you spell that? Staying here? What room?\" This inane surveying continues, and it is a total waste of my time and transparently the brainchild of some genius at what? Morgan-Stanley or whichever one of the other unaccountable big-bankster holding companies that, unfortunately, owns Hyatt??? Total waste of our time and a great way to alienate customers. One other thing: much of the clientele is fly-over state rubes who think flambe classes up a menu and doesn't worry if their ill-behaving-kids run around and do whatever they want. Orlando is a magnet for square-state families that eat American cheese on white bread. Many downtown hotels and ones near the Orlando resorts cater to these people, and so the bar is lowered all over the place: the best beer on the menu will be Sam Adams and Rodney Strong will be the best red. The wear and tear from the clientele will not be noticed by the self-same clientele, because \"back home,\" they live porcinely. It's a shame that Hyatt doesn't try harder to be better than their competitors in this environment of lowered expectations.

So we flew from Atlanta into Tampa Airport (yes, Tampa because it was half the fare vs. Orlando International) and took a rental car to Orlando. I thought getting a decent hotel at a decent rate would be no problem in Orlando. Well that didn't work out that well. So I hopped to priceline and aimed for store near the amusement parks with a bid of about $48 ($50 or less is my favorite). That didn't work so I expanded the search to the Orlando airport area and raised the bid about $4. To my shock instead of LaQuinta, Comfort Inn or others in the area that I was familiar with, the Hyatt Regency Orlando International Airport, took the bid. Should have been excited right? Well, no! I knew the hotel would be good. But unless you are actually flying into and out of that airport, then stay away. Location: I love a bargain and the hotel was nice, upscale, clean and have a great view of the main travel lobby. However, it is a major pain getting into the airport. We arrived at night and literally rolled around the airport at least three times because of the poor signage for the hotel. You finally realize it was Terminal B parking. The signs lead you almost all the way to the top of the parking garage and then the signs kind of disappear again. Again signage is the issue. You come into the terminal and walk about a good ten minutes and finally someone point you out of your confusion to the welcome desk for the hotel. You may say why do I focus on this? Simple, getting a bargain is a good thing, but if you have to go to excessive amounts of hassle to take advantage of that bargain, then is it really a bargain? For me, getting a good price, zipping into a free parking lot ($17 for parking here), and finding a really nice hotel for a price that is noticeably less than expected, that is a bargain. Again, no problems with the hotel, and if you are flying out of this airport then this is great.

Not only was our room available, but the attendants behind the front desk were cheerful and welcoming, even at 1:00 in the morning! They offered us ice cold water from a decanter, and check-in was quick and problem free. Our room was clean, spacious, and the beds were fantastic! We had a room that overlooked the main airport lobby, but we heard no noise at all.

However, the employees in the restaurant really stood out, for they were so friendly! My daughter even said that she felt like she was at Disney, with the great customer service! We also took a dip in the pool and watched the planes take off and land from the pool deck. The pool had a really unique bottom, in that it felt as if you were on a bouncy floor that was filled with air under each step. We really enjoyed playing in the pool! The only complaint I have about this hotel is that the toilet needed more water pressure (really can't stand those low flow toilets).

We looked at some prices online before going to the front desk, and the associate asked whether we had CAA which would bring the rate down to something affordable (in the $150 range). Thankfully, with a corporate discount it's even cheaper. Overall, value for money? It's worth it IF you aren't paying the full rate, but you get a lot anyway. The POOL was the best ever - my travel buddy and I actually stayed the night prior to the Endeavor launching and were able to see the launch from the poolside, although it's a TINY view. The pool has water which flows over the edge and sprays water, plus it has many lawn chairs! We swam at night; there was another (large) group but the pool is big so we all enjoyed it. It was also a cool night but the pool was warm. There are also ample towels available so you don't have to use your room towels. I LOVED this pool! It's outdoors on a roof patio so you can enjoy the sun, and the pool itself is clean (not many bugs on a 6th floor patio.) Service from the people at the front desk was efficient and overall, they were pretty friendly. Downside is that there is no dedicated wifi for the hotel lobby (you can't get wifi in the rooms, only wired internet access which you must pay around $10 for, to use for 24 hours). As a result, you're sharing the airport free internet, which is SLOW. A man kept hogging the public usage computer which had fast internet despite the 15 minute rule, haha. Bring your own laptop and hotspot (i.e. iPhones etc.) if you can; I couldn't as I am not from the US and it would be roaming for me. Oddly enough, the room service/cleaning people around the hotel didn't even crack a smile or say hi - even though I get this from cheaper/most other hotels I go to. Oh well. They're good enough at what they do - my room was really clean and so is the hotel. I also really liked the products in the bathroom; smelled great. The stay was extremely comfortable. We had two double beds; lots of pillows, and I didn't want to get up. NO complimentary water and the vending machines don't have water either. You can buy the $4 Aquafina bottle in the room or go to the airport. But here's a tip... the fitness room has an awesome water cooler! FREE spring water (no nasty Florida-taste water). Bring a water bottle! There is also a fridge in the room - but no microwave. Or perhaps just my room didn't have one, so you'll have to ask in advance if you need one. Fitness room, by the way, is excellent and CLEAN and has no horrible smells. They must clean it regularly. All the machines are a good brand and in nice shape - saw a few others using it. Has 3 ellipticals (one not working when I went), 3 treadmills, 2 stationary bikes, and various other circuit machines. The machines has all the channels like the room TV. There are chilled towels too. Very nice.

We would have stayed for another drink but needed to get out and warm up a little so didn't stay after we had eaten our meal. The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a perfect night's sleep in a lovely comfy bed. We had a room overlooking the outside of the hotel and it was extremely quiet.

McCoy's Bar & Grill would be a great place to kill a layover, even if you're not staying at the hotel overnight (but if you can, you should!). The place is really well run; the pizza was very tasty, as was the English club sandwich with egg. The new sports bar overlooking the main terminal has a smaller menu and very spotty service (we had to ask three times to have our table wiped down, and beers took 10+ minutes to arrive, despite the empty bar). Just head over to McCoy's ... better selection, and better prices. There is no WiFi in the rooms, though we were able to gain a weak connection to the airport's free WiFi service.

We were pleasantly surprised: check-in was smooth and easy despite the lobby renovations and use of a temporary check-in desk; room was much nicer than we'd expected, given that it's a prime location and we've got zero status with Hyatt. Comfortable bed, nice linens, quiet exterior room with nice, sizeable balcony. The valet was especially helpful; we had planned to check in and drop our bags, go meet friends for dinner, then return the rental car before retiring for the night, and when we let the valet know we'd only be parked for about 15 minutes, he kept our car very close and also waived the usual hourly charge. Good customer service! We did not stay long enough to try the hotel restaurant, bar or breakfast, or the wi-fi, but will be returning soon The only negative was the inability to print a boarding pass. While renovations are going on, the \"business center\" consists of a loaner laptop set up in one of the hallway common areas. There was a line of about 5 people waiting to use it when we tried, and while the concierge (whose \"office\" is the next table over from the makeshift business center) tried to print for us, her computer was too slow to even get to our airline's website. Given the number of people who will be leaving the hotel and going directly to airport security, I think this is a huge oversight. MCO first thing in the morning is a mess, and the waits to print boarding passes at many of the airlines outweigh the time savings of staying on airport property. So if you'd like a boarding pass and they've not finished their renovations, allow time to get one from your airline and don't count on the convenience of being able to do it from the hotel. Price is good but a little high considering the area.

Breakfast was included in our rate and it was a nice buffet in a restaurant over looking the runway. The kids enjoyed it. The hotel arranged for a car to collect us and take us to our hotel in Orlando. The car came right to the hotel, not to the airport pick up and it was arranged quickly and easily.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex Junction, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cservice that was above and beyond my wildest expectations\u201d", "Author": "cwpetal", "ReviewID": "UR83240198", "Content": "I was moving my dad, who has Alzheimer's from Florida to Vermont. As the date got closer, his anxiety grew and I began to fear that he'd refuse to budge from the house on the morning of our flight. I had an ah-hah moment when I remembered seeing a hotel attached to the Airport. I was willing to pay almost anything to make this transition less stressful. I was shocked to find that the price/night stay was really quite reasonable for the location. That was just the beginning of the surprises with the Hyatt. First, the hotel is gorgeous and felt very high-class and special; I found myself wishing I was traveling for a different reason and could actually take advantage of how relaxing it was! The concierges, every last one of them, were the most amazing service people I have ever, ever had the pleasure of experiencing...and I'm no spring chicken! Their bright, smiling faces, kindness, efficiency and total lack of even one iota of being stressed or annoyed was mind-blowing to me. One actually offered to go in to the men's room with my dad; another stayed with him while I returned my rental car and in the morning, yet another walked all the way to the airline check-in with us and stood in a different line so we could see which one moved more quickly. My words are not enough to describe the entire experience. I'm only sorry that I don't normally travel much and have a need to stay in a Hyatt again. PS...the pillows...oooh my, the pillows...they were so very perfect that I did research when I returned home to see if I could find out what brand they were.

The soundproofing at the balcony doors were not adequate and we could hear the fountain within the airport and the constant automated tanoy messages (which were announced every ten minutes!). Also there was some clattering noise all night like the mechanics of the lifts, but we weren't near the lift so probably wasn't that. We barely slept despite the comfortable bed. Plus point of the room was the plush bathroom. On arriving for breakfast at 10.30 it took 30mins to get seated.

This can be good or bad, depending on why you stay there and what plans you have for while you are there. For me, it was a mixed bag because I was not flying anywhere and had simply sought a good hotel at a good price in the Orlando airport area. For the harried air traveler, there are few conveniences that can match a decent hotel right in the airport terminal. This is an elegant and attractive hotel with its interior atrium opening into the huge passenger assembly area of Terminals A and B. From some rooms you can not only watch people milling about or waiting in endless TSA lines, but you may also be able to see the departures and arrivals postings on the wall. The rooms are very well appointed and the public areas equally pleasant. I got a king bed, a bath with marble throughout and a good workspace on a nice desk. The TV was fine. The seventh floor room appeared well cared for and I had no issues with housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is a pleasant change. Check in was fine, except that the hotel was unable to help me find a parking place for my car, even though they supposedly have an area in the garage for guest parking. There was no problem, however, with them charging me to park. It seemed like a sort of reverse strategy: get the money and let the guest worry about finding a space that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mile from the hotel! Not a policy in keeping with the four star rating they apparently have. I expect that if they have a valet service, all of this is moot, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want someone else parking my car. For what I paid through an on-line booking service where I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the name of the property until I paid for it, this was a pretty good deal. But after adding in parking, bellman tips to help lug in baggage, internet access fee, travel distance from car to hotel room and back, initially hauling my luggage around the ninety degree garage trying to find a hotel entry and having to resolve how to get from the hotel to where I intended to go for a dinner meeting, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the good deal I had hoped for. In addition, once in the airport parking garage, the only way I could leave was to pay and then try and get back in again later. No \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd permitted. The source of these problems, according to hotel sources, is the airport authority, which owns the hotel and parking areas, thus controlling what guests can do. Net reaction: If you need overnight accommodations physically inside the airport grounds and want a quality facility, this might be the right choice. This would be the ideal place to stay if you have a very early departure because you can roll out of the hotel and into the terminal. No shuttles, no carts. If, like me, you had business outside the airport, even at a low price this was not the greatest. There are plenty of good, lower priced hotels with free parking within a few minutes of the terminals. They would be a better choice. Would I stay there again? Yes, if I got the same low price, was just staying on airport property for the night, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car to park and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go anywhere else; like Disney, Orlando city, etc. I suspect these issues are why they are offering the deals on the unnamed hotel booking site.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThe convenience of this Hyatt property is completely discounted by the high price and poor service.\u201d", "Author": "SHOUPIII", "ReviewID": "UR67340314", "Content": "I stayed at the Hyatt Regency @ the Orlando Airport and wanted to send a note to express my displeasure with the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of my last stay.

It is literally located inside the airport therefore allowing quick access to and from the gates. With this convenience however comes a cost - you are not near anything else. Access to the hotel lobby is done via escalator in one of the airports large atriums. It is often noisy and crowded in this area but once you get up to the lobby the noise softens. The check-in area can sometimes feel cramped if it is busy, but I've never had to wait long to be processed here. You will notice once you get in the elevator (and use your key for access) that this hotel is large. Two hallways extend from the elevators opening to more hallways. The hotel has a general open space feel to it which is nice. Soft touches like greenery and fountains make the open hallways more upscale. Rooms are very nicely furnished. A huge king size bed always greets me, along with its abundance of pillows. The rooms are decortated in a bit of a modern Victorian theme, with lighter wood furnishings and green/grey/yellow colors. Most rooms have balconies either facing outside or the airpot atrium. I always face outside and the room is dead quiet - some of my colleagues have faced the airport and found it a bit noisy. Bathrooms are very large, usually including both a shower stall and bathtub. Bath products are the higher end Hyatt brand with some nice extras such as toothpaste. Fluffy towels are a plus. Internet is provided for a fee in the room, although if you have a balcony facing the atrium you can usually pick up the MCO free wifi signal. Consequently, you can also go sit in the airport and use their free wifi. There is a functional gym, though no large by any standard especially for a hotel this big. I imagine it's not widely used since most traffic is probably quick transit passengers. The pool area is also relatively small though never usually busy. The fountains shooting into the pool with the Air Traffic Tower is a nice photo op. :) There is a pub in the hotel that is open quite late - always apprecaited by myself if we have a late arrival. The breakfast buffet also gets rave reviews from my colleagues. I generally just head into the airport for food, stopping at the large food court that has many options. Overall this is a nice, upscale hotel. Its location isn't the greatest if you are spending multiple nights here but it is perfect for an evening.

Then stayed one night on the return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arrived the evening before the transatlantic return. Very relaxing way to travel. It's not new, but not old either. But it's aging a bit. Room large and clean. Mini fridge and overhead fan. At least one million pillows on the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact, I had to find a place in the room to put all of them at night. Very comfortable hotel, but most of the airport shops closed before 9:30, including food places. So not much to do after that. Staff was first rate. Must the result of a great hotel manager and training program. Very professional, great personal appearance, efficient, knowledgeable and helpful. Good job Hyatt. Room was quiet despite the proximity to the runways. I made a US Government rate reservation a month prior and had a nice surprise when the reservation ($166) rate was reduced to $133 to reflect the Government rate for that day when I checked in. I didn't have to ask. I was very impressed with that. The hotel McCoy Bar had an interesting fare. The regular stuff you would expect as well as more exotic items: sushi and a tapas type approach. The tapas were a good idea, but the taste was a bit predictable. \"Thai tenders\" were big but with a bottled sweet chili sauce (lots of garlic). The fried calamari were nicely done, but undone by a strange sauce underneath (should have only used some lemon and pepper with a lightly salted batter). If you didn't like the sauce, it was on the bottom of the calamari., so you didn't have a choice. Coconut prawn was tasty, but so-so. All items looked prepackaged. However, a great idea (social communal food) but fresher items with a bit more thought about the sauce could have made it great. Still, a nice relaxing place to have a casual meal after getting off the plane. What I didn't like (there is always room for improvement). The room had wireless internet, but not free. Also the internet fee was not very obvious. If budget hotels can offer free internet, these larger chains could also. No free parking (it's the airport, so I suppose that's understandable). I thought the television could have had more channels (after all, it's the US). The TV was a CRT rather than a flat screen. Size was adequate, but I expected something larger. No safe in the room. It's not expensive to put a safe in every room. Breakfast not included in the room price. Breakfast was, however, very nice but the cost was pushing the high side of reasonable. Not to end on the dislikes, I would stay there again in a second. Convenient for the weary traveler, comfortable and well run.

The room was very clean and relaxing. It even had doors that opened onto a small balcony. The beds were the most comfortable that we slept on our entire trip.

Even though the reviews we read were mostly positive, we really didn't expect to find anything more than a moderate hotel plunked in the airport with average amenities. We were dead wrong. When we found the location of our rental car return (Avis), there was an entrance to the hotel right there, so we unloaded the car and entered the hotel. Even though that entrance is not near the lobby, we were spotted by a bellhop almost immediately, and he brought a cart for our bags and took us to the lobby. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable, took the time to explain the layout of the hotel and which ammenities they offered, as well as what to expect during check-in at the airport the next morning. Very thorough. The bellhop took us to our room in one of the elevators, there are 3 or 4 right by the lobby. For security reasons the elevators will only go up if activated by a room key, which is a great security measure. He asked us when our flight was leaving the next morning, we told him the airline and flight time and he said he would have a bellhop come to our room and take us right to the flight check-in, that was a nice service we didn't expect. He also told us that there was a channel on our TV which had updated flight schedules on it and when we checked later sure enough...it was just like the big boards in the airport. Another handy service. There are 2 restaurants on the property, one close to the lobby which looked moderately priced, and one on the top floor which is more upscale and only opens in the evenings apparently. We didn't eat at either one so can't comment on the food, but they looked clean and the menus looked appetizing. The top-floor restaurant looks like it has a great view of the area. We instead chose to eat in the actual airport, as they have quite a few restaurants as well as a large food court with fast-food places. We ended up eating at a very good Italian restaurant, and noticed they had a good-sized Chili's also. Later we checked out the pool, again wasn't expecting much but was surprised to find a tropical outside setting with covered seating, a waterfall, many trees and plants, and a manned barcart. And the strange thing is that you would think having an outside pool at an airport hotel would be loud from the air traffic, but you really don't hear the planes at all, apparently the hotel must block most of the sound from the runways. We stayed poolside for a couple hours, it was really relaxing. The next morning the bellhop showed up as promised and took us to the airline check-in counter. After looking at the long line, he said \"I'm taking you outside to curbside check-in, these guys will get us in faster\", and we were checked in 2 minutes. Another example of going the extra mile.

I always feel that Florida lacks decent sushi so it was a lovely surprise when McCoy's brought good sushi in to the mix! Some people don't like the hotel being in the airport terminal. Me? I love it! Get off a flight late and you can be in bed 5 minutes later! Early flight out? Don't fight the traffic with everyone else. Our children love the rooftop pool. There is poolside service and they love watching the planes take off. As one of them said 'ah, this is the life'! When you are 4 - it's the perfect combination! Try to stay over looking the runway.

When we arrived, there was nobody to help, so I found my own luggage cart, but as I started rolling it away, a bellboy immediately came to help with unloading our luggage. The staff was extremely friendly, and the rooms were beautifully decorated and pristinely clean. If you are into ordering room service, the prices are outrageous, and they charge a delivery fee, plus a 19% gratuity to the bill. Needless to say my friend and I found another place at the airport to eat dinner, so I cannot say if the food was good or not. Problem number one: The rooms were very warm, and even though the thermostat showed 72 degrees, it was mildly uncomfortable. Problem number two: In our room on the tenth floor, the air conditioner made a very loud clanking noise every time it turned on, which was often because the thermostat had to be turned way down to make the room cool. We both through we could sleep through the noise, but after having tried for two hours, the noise was loud enough to keep waking us up. Problem number three: at around one in the morning (I needed to get up at 5:15, and had yet had no sleep due to air conditioner noise) I decided to turn the thermostat back up to keep the air conditioner from running so much. There was also a ceiling fan in the room, and I thought that maybe it was running the wrong direction, and circulating all the cool air up to the ceiling. There was a dimmer switch on the wall for the fan, and when I pushed it to turn it off, something was obviously wrong with the circuitry, and it turned on the fire alarm system in the room, possibly the whole floor. After the initial panic wore off, i tried turning the knob, and the alarm finally turned off. It was embarassing to have caused the alarm, and it woke up people that were on my floor. I then called the front desk to tell them what happened, and they promptly sent someone up to move us to a different room. They then offered a voucher for a free breakfast the next morning, which did me no good because I had to check in my flight before the restaurant even opened. When I returned home, I felt like splurging on the hotel was a complete waste, because with the bad experience I had, it was neither restful nor convenient.

After a long day and the joy of queuing ages to get through immigration at orlando Airport, our booking in at the hotel was excellent. We were fotunate to be checked in by the best hotel receptionist in the USA, Angie on both occasions. Quick, friendly efficient and with a good sense of humour.

The rooms are lovely, not massive but very nicely decorated with enourmous well-lit closets and comfortable beds. Feather pillows are standard but foam are available for the asking. Lighting and electronics in the room are all convenient and quality. The staff at this hotel are top notch, special requests and concerns are dealt with the way we wish that all hotels would deal with such issues. The bathrooms are luxurious and the ammenities are fantastic (that massage bar in both lavendar citrus & white ginger is a DREAM). The food from room service is expensive but generous, quick and delicious. The buffet breakfast is convenient and tasty. I usually opt for the inexpensive ($9) continental rather than the full buffet as it offers yogurt, fresh berries and tropical fruit, and cheese as well as some top-notch baked goods. Their pastry chef is great, some of the best biscuits I've had in any hotel in the USA. Thier coffee is rich and tasty a VERY nice change from many of the unfortunate coffee's I've been served in the US (weak and nastyf... eewwwww) The only issue I've ever had was VERY SLOW breakfast service at McCoys on one occassion. This was dealt with quickly and efficiently by management and the compensation offered was more than adequate to make up for the inconvenience.

Having stayed at other airport hotels (both for work & by being stranded), the Hyatt Orlando Airport was the nicest, most professional, and best on site airport hotel I have stayed at in the USA. Positives: Upon arriving on a \"red-eye\" flight from the West Coast, it was a welcome site to see the hotel within the terminal, upon going past security. The Hotel Staff was very pleasant, professional, and most of all accomdiating in having a room available for at 7:00 AM (instead of the standard 4:00 PM checkin). The Hotel is quite large, with 9 floors, some looking over the runway, others over the parking lot towards the city, and others overseeing (making up) the main part of the Orlando (MCO) terminal. All rooms had balconys. The rooms were larger than expected with separate sitting areas, large bath room, and a closet large enough to put a suit case in if needed. One additional perk was an I-Home IPOD Alarm Clock (retail for $99) for MP3 (IPODS), which was nice to be able to dock & listen to music. Wireless worked well throughout the hotel. Rooms sound proofed very well (my room didn't look over the terminal or runway). Shower was large & no problem plumming or hot water. Complementary Sunday Local Paper & USA Today. Hotel food was better than average & not too expensive. Location is great for meetings (meeting spaces/ballrooms were very large and good for both meetings and/or weddings). Staff was professional & courteous. Hotel had valet parking & parking structure outside a door from the lobby. Business center on site. $89 rooms available to people from 6AM to 6PM. Airline Flight board on TV in Lobby & Rooms. Check in for all flights w/boarding passes printable in Lobby. Negatives (not too many): Expensive (over $200 per night for an airport hotel is a bit steep, due to being 10+ miles away from anything in Orlando). Only one guest computer for use (printer didn't work). No Sauna or Whirlpool. The pool overlooks runway (kewl) but definitely not \"florida like\" being all cement without trees, etc. on the 4th floor over the terminal. Overall, for one night prior to an early flight, great location & way to catch the flight, walk downstairs and go right to checkin and security. Also, great location for a meeting/wedding that has alot of out of town people coming into town for a few days (if they don't need to see anything in Orlando). I would stay there again for Business or a night before a flight.

Booked the room through Priceline and was worried once I had looked up reviews on different sites, but decided to give it a try anyway and am glad we did. The hotel was very nice, no complaints. Room and grounds were clean, staff was friendly and helpful, very nice lobby/lounge area. The hotel was right off the freeway and just a short drive from downtown and the airport.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cIt's perfectly acceptable\u201d", "Author": "WayneCarter", "ReviewID": "UR119902749", "Content": "Basically this hotel makes its money of a local railroad company. They have train engineers come in during the middle of the night, and they sleep on the third floor which is off limits to everyone else. Otherwise the place it pretty bare. It's clean, seems relatively safe, and the staff is nice enough. But there's no real dining options. The manager does a Sam's run on the weekend and stocks the place with Cup of Noodles, and frozen burgers, etc that you can purchase for inflated prices. Breakfast buffet is offered in the morning, but I think it's part of the railroad deal. Everytime I went in there, it was packed with the railroad workers laughing and talking shop. No one else really. I found certain staff to be wonderfully helpful others not so much. I was told I couldn't have a kind size bed because I booked on priceline. Even though the hotel was empty on the 2nd floor when I got there. I wouldn't hesitate staying again. Clean, nice staff, and great price. But I totally wouldn't call it a 3 star hotel. More like 2 to 2.5. I felt like an add on to the railroad workers home, not a guest at a Marriott.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cSlow Internet Bad Neighborhood UnFree Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "shaunbsc", "ReviewID": "UR118961033", "Content": "Really not a bad deal for a hotel. I bid 65 at priceline and stayed for 2 nights, total cost after taxes, etc was about 170. Looks like the renovations are mostly done. My room was great, very big. King bed, sofa, desk, new tv, plenty of lighting, clean, but no micro/fridge. AC and cable worked well. Staff was friendly and place was pretty good. Awesome fitness center, compared to other places. Full dumbbell rack from 5lbs to 50lbs, 2 elipticals, 2 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 bench, tvs on all cardio equipment. Free parking as well, and real good breakfast. Onto the not so good... Internet was quite possibly slower than dial up, actually, much slower. It is a wired in-room ethernet connection, and it is plain bad. They say there is a ethostream wireless available but there is none. Very frustrating when trying to work. Location is not the best. Getting something to eat that isn't fast food, hot wings, or chinese is a 5+ mile drive. There were also several unsavory characters roaming the parking lot and smoking weed while sitting in cars at all hours of the night. I walked to the gas station across the street to get a gatorade around 10pm and the door was locked. You have to use a very small \"night window\" to purchase anything inside, and its basically a 6\" wide x 2\" deep drawer that the clerk slides out while she looks at you like you're mentally challenged. So if it's not a pack of cigarrettes your buying its not fitting in the drawer and you're out of luck. Had to drive to CVS a mile down the road. Breakfast is not free, which was a surprise. Its a very small hot buffet and I walked in to an unattended room and began helping myself, and after about 10 minutes a very chipper lady came in and asked me how everything was. Shortly after she dropped a bill on my table. Also, my room was not cleaned after my first night, completely untouched. That was strange. Otherwise, it was a pretty pleasant stay. It's probably an average deal considering the surrounding neighborhood. Think twice if you are a business traveler just because the internet is so bad, even in the business center. Otherwise, not a bad stay. Good amenities. Big fan of the fitness center.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201c\"Nice overnight stay\"\u201d", "Author": "JairBe", "ReviewID": "UR118490154", "Content": "Staff great, friendly helpful...

The staff was nice and friendly and helped us with directions to attractions, etc. I felt safe in this hotel, but it was far from the local attractions (Beale, Graceland, etc).

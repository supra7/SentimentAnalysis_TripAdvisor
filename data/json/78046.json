They put us in a room that had a wonderful view of the roof top (those who have stayed in room 379 know what I'm talking about). We pulled back the sheets of our bed and there was brown stuff that looked like dry blood all over them. I tried to call down to the front desk but unfortunately neither one of our phones worked so I had to walk down to the front desk to inform them of this issues with the room. They moved us to a different room (room 618) that wasn't much better our sheets were clean but our bathroom was disgusting! hair in the bathtub and what looked like urine on the toilet and our TV remote didn't work. Luckily I had brought along some Clorox wipes because I was to tired to change rooms again. We were abruptly woken up at 6:45 AM in the morning to a child yelling at his brother to let him in the room which continued until about 7:30 AM. I needed to do some work while on vacation so I connected to the wireless and to my surprise it costs $12.95 per 24 hour period. I thought are you kidding me?

The other side of the hallway is much better and the view of the city skyline and Hollywood Hills is nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the cleaning ladies were friendly and accommodating.

Amazing Service: The front desk staff was kind enough to allow us to store a couple of small items (GPS, LA guidebook, and other things we didn't need in Fiji) in a safety deposit box for the 3 weeks between stays (very helpful when you are worried about luggage weight limitations for inter-island flights). When our return flight was cancelled then delayed 17 hours (meaning we would not arrive in LA until 8am), we called the front desk to change our reservation to \"day-use\". Since the hotel was full, they could not guarantee a day-use room would be available, and it was past the cancellation cut-off time (meaning we would be charged for the night), so they granted us a 3pm late check-out to ensure we could get some needed sleep after our 11-hour flight.

The Shuttle picked us up from the airport without hassle, but check-in took the shine off things. The girl on the desk was pretty abrupt and unfriendly, she had no record of our request for late checkout or for a crib for our daughter, despite me having phoned ahead to arrange both. She acted as though it was a major headache for her to sort them out. The porter who brought our bags and the housemaid who eventually brought the crib were both really friendly and helpful, no complaints there. The room was really nice, clean and recently refurbished. The soundproofing was good, both from the surrounding rooms and from LAX nearby. The bed was HUGE and really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired and had a few minor problems (such as the plug in the sink refusing to seal), but was basically okay. Our room rate came with included internet and breakfast, so I was surprised to be directed to a screen explaining the charges for internet when I went to check my e-mail. When I phoned the front desk they checked my rate and told me to accept and that the charge for internet would then be deducted from my bill. Something I should really have been told at check-in. Similarly, we went down to breakfast to be told that we should have been given vouchers at check-in. When I went to get them it was the same girl as the night before and the same surly attitude, not even so much as a word of apology. The breakfast was fantastic, however, and the serving staff were all friendly and efficient. We would have liked to have made use of the hotel's fantastic pool area, unfortunately the pool was drained down and taped off, no explanation was given as to why. We used the hotel gym which was great and then had lunch in the hotel bar and again the food and the service were excellent, nothing to complain about. One major complaint is that while my wife was walking our daughter around the lobby in her stroller to try to get her to sleep, she was hassled by a guy who had wandered in off the street and was asking people for money. When she told the concierge desk, they called security and had the guy removed, but this sort of thing shouldn't really be happening at all in this sort of hotel. The late checkout we'd arranged meant that we kept the room until 5pm, so I was distincly unimpressed to return to it just after 2pm (the normal checkout time) to find that the key cards no longer worked in the door. When I went tot the front desk to get it sorted out I got a different girl, but the same attitude. Once again, no apology was offered.

You would have thought I had asked for Russian caviar, \"Um you mean you want me to go check to see if we can sell you aspirin??\" \"OK, we have it, but it's $10!\" \"OK, I'll sell it to you, but it will take a while, I have to fill out this invoice and you'll have to sign it.\" I hope I'm not sounding petty, but has no one ever asked for aspirin before? I paid $120 a night each for two rooms. Had I paid the prices that I see are being advertised now, I would have felt very overcharged.

The airport provided great entertainment for the kids as they spent alot of time watching the runway activity out the room window. The beds were very comfortable and the room was fine. My biggest complaint was the breakfast served in the restaurant. They have a breakfast buffet which was about $20 per person so for a family of four this was pricey (should have gone to Starbucks in the lobby but family wanted a sit down experience). I don't mind paying high prices if the food is good but this was the worst breakfast buffet I have ever seen. The scrambled eggs can only be described as \"eggs soup\", the pastries were stale, the waffles were hard and crunchy, and I can't even explain the texture and flavor of the pancakes. My daughter said they \"must be the healthy pancakes\" but when I checked they did not appear to be the multi-grain pancakes that you find at other places and they definately did not have the texture.

I also told her that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to have a list of rooms with pets so that these rooms can be properly cleaned afterwards. With a simple vacuuming to recycle these rooms for other guest is not enough. Dog hair is a trigger for some asthmatic individuals that can lead to a chronic inflammatory of the airways, which then leads to an asthma attack. Any excuse that this hotel gives me is unacceptable since management is well aware that hotel rooms are public shared places which should be sanitized and clean properly after guest check out.

It had a nice shower with a lots of pressure but, the old drain could not keep up with the draining and water pooled up deep when I was taking shower. The most disappointed things were customer service and airport shuttle service. The hotel shares some vans with other hotels near by to pick passengers up from LAX which is about 5 minutes away. Those van are making continuing loop between hotels and LAX. Hotel post that there are pickups every 15-20minutes. We were waiting at the LAX pickup points for a long time when we called the hotel. The front desk connected us to a lady at valet who really did not care. She said that the van is at hotel now and leaving soon to the LAX and it will be 15-20 more minutes before our pickup. First, it only takes 5minutes to the LAX, well OK it might have to make few different terminal stops but, do they only have one van? We end up taking a van for a long term parking located near the hotel since the driver offered to drop us off by the hotel. When we mentioned about the shuttle service at the front desk, the clerk did not care and brushed us off. Later we hound out that the van service was contracted out to a third company.

I set my bag on the round coffee table and obviously someone spilled coffee, how they got it up under the glass I will never know, but putting my bag caused the fluid to come out in little bursts, I took a towel moved the glass and cleaned it up, willing to over look the incident. I go to connect to the internet and there instructions are very unclear, I was told I would not be charged but it asked me to approve being charged anyways I called to inquire and the front desk person said she would take it off. She Did it never appeared. Later in the evening I made 3 toll free calls which they charged me $6.00 for there was no phone card in the room indicating that so I called the front desk and they had indeed overcharged me by $4.00. It was supposed to be $2.00 for the first 60 minutes. Even though there was nothing to indicate that. So I get up to take a shower turn the water on and jump in because I saw a bottle I assume was shampoo, wrong there was a bar of face soap, no body soap and a little bottle of conditioner no shampoo. I was already soaked and had to make do. Honestly I expect a lot better from the Sheraton. So I called down to hotel services and the perfectly nice lady, said she could give me 1200 points on the Starwood program equivalent to $8.00 . At this point I said whatever and hung up. The problem is the staff was nice, the property was nice but these small issues are what make a difference between a superior class hotel and a average/poor hotel. I have had a bad streak with hotels lately because in this economy you expect what you pay for, I have stayed at a Day's Inn and were more satisfied then at the Sheraton and to me that seems very strange especially considering the huge price difference. To sum it all up, if you stay here double and triple check to make sure you ave all your essentials dont assume anything. My mark of poor maybe a little overstated, but it is not above average. I did take pictures of the coffee stained towels (I dont drink coffee and the face soap and conditioner in the shower after the fact).

Check-in was pretty quick and easy. The FIRST room on a SPG member floor that they gave us was an adjoining room. And I previously had a bad experience with adjoining room where the neighbor was too loud with a family and the noise from kids was so prevalent that I couldn't sleep. So we asked for another room. The next room, on a non-SPG member floor, had a heavy smoke smell and it bothered my wife since she has a very sensitive sense of smell. The THIRD room, on a different non-SPG member floor, had a weird body odor smell. We almost puked when we walked in. So we finally gave up and said that we'll take the first room that was adjoining. The staff member called us about 5 mins later while we were settling in and asked us how everything was. I explained to him what happened and he apologized and said that he'd give us complimentary breakfast vouchers for one day. When the voucher was sent up, he actually gave us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay. That was a nice little touch. Under promise and over deliver. The breakfast buffet spread wasn't all that great. It had everything you'd probably expect except that the food wasn't that great. So we decided to skip breakfast on two of the days and gave the vouchers to ppl we saw checking-in. And just like everyone has previously said, the self-parking lot was not very convenient. it wasn't so much of a problem or an issue but just an annoyance that it's behind the hotel across the street. And a couple of nights, the lot was so full that we had to park almost at the end of the lot. And if you've been to the lot, you KNOW how huge the lot is. The lot isn't specific to the Sheraton. It's a park n ride for anyone and everyone so the LOT IS HUGE. And when you're coming back late at night, the side entrances of the hotel is locked/closed, so you have to walk all the way to the front of the hotel to enter. Yes, it's cheaper than other hotels like the Westin but very inconvenient. As for ppl asking about the airport/airplane noise, yes you can hear it but it's not noticeable unless you actually TRY and listen to it. It's basically sounds like the a/c or the heater just turned on or something to that effect. A few other misc. items... Good: Computer with internet/printer access, free Wifi in the lobby areas, nice lobby renovations, location is very convenient to the airport, close to rental car companies Bad: Bathrooms are dated and dirty Tip: If you're a SPG member, the SPG floor rooms give you free bottled water in the rooms. I noticed it cause I saw 3 different rooms and the 2 non-SPG floor rooms did not have free water bottles. If you really don't mind the inconvenience of parking, the hotel is a decent stay. I'd probably try another hotel the next time just so that i can compare but it's definitely not a bad hotel.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san antonio, tx", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding customer service!\u201d", "Author": "viprjr", "ReviewID": "UR121707354", "Content": "Stayed here 12 Dec and really enjoyed my stay!

There is a third-party parking lot about a 10 minute walk from the lobby, which at most times has only one booth open for exit. During the day, it can take 1/2 hour or more to get out of the lot because of long lines (it is a regular LAX airport parking lot, not just for the hotel) -- when you combine that with the long walk, it pretty much eliminates any advantage you have from being close to the airport.

We chose the Sheraton Gateway mainly because of the generally favourable reviews on Tripadvisor - although there are a lot of other hotels also located at LAX. Sadly it was a bit of a disappointment and certainly didn't match our expectations - and I simply fail to see how it can rate as highly in the overall pecking order of hotels at both LAX and more generally in the Los Angeles area. Let's be quite clear - it is simply an average hotel. It does what it says on the tin - nothing really badly but equally nothing that in any way wows you or makes it stand out from the crowd. The building is enormous - but from the outside to the public areas and into the bedrooms it really could do with being brightened up and modernised because it just felt old. The free transfer service was easy to find and took just a few minutes - but there was no direction from the driver on arrival at the hotel. He'd obviously done his bit - we were just sort of dumped along the entry road leading to the main door. Once inside the hotel the reception area was easy to find - although there were various barriers and signs regarding priority and this didn't make for an especially welcoming experience. The receptionist was friendly enough and got the job done - but where was the genuine warmth and personality or indeed any explanation of the hotel facilities? The best we got was the direction of the lift - and it was only after I asked about the included breakfast that some vouchers were forthcoming. Once in the room we were again left wondering if we had chosen well. Sure it was large and featured all the items you would expect - but the lighting was quite poor making it somewhat dark and it didn't smell that fresh either. The beds were comfortable and we slept reasonably well - but aircraft noise is audible. Breakfast was probably the high point of our stay since the self-help buffet was both extensive and of good quality. Once again though the staff seemed to be largely going through the motions rather than actually enjoying their work - there was little in the way of smiling faces or genuine warmth and we left without anyone noticing. Check-out was painless - the bill had been settled by credit card overnight so no need to visit the reception desk. But no opportunity for anyone to show any interest or ask if we had enjoyed our stay either. The transfer back to the airport was largely a repeat of our arrival - queue up on the approach road next to the appropriate sign then board the bus and get dropped off at the correct terminal. So - and the only thing that really matters - would we use this hotel again? Maybe - but probably only if there was no other choice or if we heard that it had had a bit of a make-over.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cOne of the BEST Airport Hotels around!\u201d", "Author": "F16Pilot", "ReviewID": "UR120226079", "Content": "Sheraton Gateway LAX exceeds expectations for an airport hotel.

HORRIBLE SERVICE. NIGHT SHIFT EMPLOYEES HAD BAD ATTITUDE, NO HINT OF \"HOSPITALITY\" IN THEIR BONES, AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I finally arrived at LAX airport after an agonizing journey that involved me missing my flight and my midterm the next morning. My flight was in 8 hours and after the horrible time I had just been through all I wanted to do was get a hotel room and get 4 hours of sleep. I was so distressed at the time that when I arrived at Starwood at 12 30am I was actually in tears, only to find that I had arrived at the wrong Sheraton and not Four Points (Gateway is more expensive and high-end). When I got to the counter and asked for the rate for 4 hours, the guest service agent looked down at me (I was still teary-eyed) and said in the most demeaning, least compassionate tone, \"It doesn't matter if you just stay for 4 hours or a whole day. 220.\" After thinking it over for around 10 minutes I was so upset that I decided that I needed the room and came back. But the two agents had already gone back into the room behind the counter and I had to wait another 10 minutes until they finally reappeared. Thankfully one of them had a little more humanity and seeing me puffy eyes and in tears at 1am, lowered the room rate to 180 + tax after a series of prying questions regarding my horrible night. I was so ready to head to my room and just pass out at that point, but when I got to my room and swiped my key (which was VERY far from the elevators and 7 or 9 floors up considering my time constraint) THE ROOM DOOR WAS BOLTED. An OLD MAN proceeded to come to the door in a BATHROB and informed me that it was HIS room, and that I must have made a mistake. Exhausted and even more upset at this point, I went ALL THE WAY back down to the counter, where only ONE of the guest service agents had reappeared this time. He was helping another guest check in, but even though he clearly realized that I had a problem (because I had returned after less than 10 minutes), and had little time left to spare, he avoided making eye contact or summoning his coworker until he was done helping the couple (-~10 more minutes of my life). FINALLY I got a new room key to my new room, and when I finally got into the door, despite flicking the light switch in both directions multiple times, THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN MY ROOM. I looked around for the cardholder to put in my keycard (because sometimes you need to plug in the card for the electricity to work), but no, the lights were just not working in my room. I was almost headed back down when exhausted and defeated as I felt, I walked straight into the dark room and tried switching on an individual lamp, which thankfully managed to turn on. I had a horrible night to begin with, but the inept and lack of service and the poor attitude of the Sheraton Gateway staff made my experience so much more exhaustive and awful than it had to be. Ironic that employees working in the HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY do not seem to know the first thing about being hospitable and are incapable of showing any form of sympathy (instead displaying downright rudeness) to a guest who clearly had been through a rough day. Don't even get me started on the filthy bathrooms... But needless to say I will never be coming back to Sheraton Gateway again.

I noticed online that the Gateway had been recently remodeled and had mostly good reviews so I decided to give Sheraton one more try. I'm so glad I did! This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. EVERYONE I encountered was friendly and accommodating, the bed was super comfortable and I loved the gym, pool and hot tub. Hats off to the entire management team and staff members for a well deserved 5-star review. I spent 4 nights there and didn't want to leave. In this review I'm going to address some of the things others brought up here on TA so hopefully you can make an informed decision. There is a free airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes making it fast and easy to get to/from the hotel. If you have a car, the hotel promotes valet parking. For self parking, drive into the hotel entrance and head straight back past 98th street and you'll dead end to a privately-owned airport parking lot. They allow Sheraton guests to park there for about $14 a night. You will need to pre-pay and then will get in and out privileges during your entire stay. Warning, the lot fills up on weekends (I arrived on Wednesday so had no problem). I noticed they were turning folks away on Friday/Saturday. There is 2-hour street parking on 98th but you'll get a ticket if exceed the two hour limit so be warned. Valet is expensive -- I think around $24 a night -- about $10 more than self-parking. There may be other parking options nearby but you would need to check with hotel staff. I arrived at 1:30 pm and being an SPG Gold Member was hoping I could get an early check-in and a complimentary room upgrade. In my recent stays at Starwood properties Gold members don't get decent upgrades so I was pleased that the Gateway recognized my status and upgraded me to the Club Floor (Top Floor, 15th - with Key Access only). I was able to check into my room early but immediately noticed that the air conditioning was making a funny dripping noise (which was pretty annoying). I called the front desk and they sent an engineer up. At first he said I would need to change rooms but he was able to fix the problem after all. I received a follow-up call to see if I wanted to change rooms and I declined. Great service, no problem. The club lounge was really nice, very large and had a great view of the LAX runway. The lounge has a good selection of fruit, cereal, bagels and juice for breakfast as well as complimentary snacks for dinner. Beer and wine can be purchased from 4-8 pm for a nominal fee. During the day you have access to the lounge where you can work, watch TV, read the paper or get an espresso. A computer/printer is also available for use at no charge. I was able to print my boarding pass there. The lobby/entrance of the hotel is really nice and features free WI-Fi. Lots of people were hanging out in the lobby with friends, work colleagues or on their computer sipping a glass of wine. Very fun vibe. It has a W feel to it without the annoying drunk/party crowd. For me, the highlight of the hotel was the gym and pool/hot tub. The gym is big and has a great selection of modern equipment. As for the pool, it was like I had it all to myself. It's also open really late which is a big plus! The pool area has comfy lounge chairs, large daybeds, FREE heated cabanas (great for socializing at night) -- the space is very relaxing and well thought out. My only complaint for the pool area is that smokers hang out there and blow smoke all over you. I wish they didn't allow smoking in the pool area. The rooms are nice, updated and have great beds. Housekeeping was really friendly and did a great job servicing my room. I only wish there was a safe, fridge and iPod connector in the room. The bathroom was small and a bit dated but functional. I too experienced problems with drainage in the bathtub (as others here have mentioned). The walls are pretty thin and the first night I got awoken at 4 am by some really loud folks in the room next to me. It was really annoying but they must have checked out as the next 3 nights were really quiet. I love that fact that the room was totally dark with the curtains closed. Pitch black... great for sleeping. We had an amazing dinner Saturday night at the hotel's restaurant called Paparazzi. It's unique Italian food with a twist. With the tip and a bottle of wine, it came to $190 for 3 of us so it was pretty pricy but the atmosphere and food quality was great. Our server was also very efficient and friendly. He explained several dishes to us and how they were prepared. Be sure and get the artichokes as an appetizer. Amazing presentation! I wish all Sheraton hotels were like the Gateway. I will now look for Sheraton hotels that have been recently remodeled. Many of the older Sheraton hotels are in pretty bad shape. They did a fantastic job with the remodel on the Gateway and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. The service and friendliness of the staff really stood out for me. Congrats on a fantastic job Gateway...

Where was the plain shrimp alfredo. None. Not even a dish with alfredo or cream sauce. Everything had too much something extra in it - mushrooms when I didn't want any, asparagus if I didn't want it, etc. And it was hard to read the menu - just give me plain english please. I ended up having a pizza from them (good pizza). One night I did order room service (stuck working and without a car) and the food was delicious! The menu had more selections. You can hear the airplanes take off but it wasn't disturbing. Also an EXCELLENT rate. $135 pre-pay (wireless in room is extra). It was prepaid because I was sent there for work and it was pretty much a guarantee I was going. Very surprised at the price. Excellent value! No fridge or microwave in room but I absolutely would stay there again. Getting around with no car? Have them get you a cab instead of taking a car service if you're only going a few blocks (CVS, supermarket, bank, Kohls, nail salon, strip malls, etc). You should be able to catch a taxi back or call a taxi company to pick you up to take you back to the hotel.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cEstela Estrada\u201d", "Author": "D D", "ReviewID": "UR118429794", "Content": "i was so very pleased with the attentiveness and wonderful service rendered by Estela Estrada.

The rooms are quite spacious and the cleanliness is to a very high standard - the cleaning staff work very hard! The first room I was given was looking at the runway so I moved rooms and was given one overlooking the pool which was a much better view. They have a policy of rewarding you with $5 per night if you forego the maid service - I only received 3 vouchers in total even though I left the ticket on my door every night and the queue in the morning at the check in desk was always so long I couldn't be bothered to wait and get my voucher. The main thing I would have liked in my room would have been a mini fridge to store my own drinks. The internet was $12.95 for the night - very pricy!! Albert in the concierge was so helpful and friendly - that guy knows everything about LA and the places to check out and nothing is too much trouble. The staff on the check in desk were a little frosty and stiff but very professional and polite. The Starbucks and lobby area makes the hotel feel a bit more luxurious than it actually is, however the pool is always a bonus - there is also a spa jacuzzi but its always busy. If you want a hotel right near the airport to use as a base to explore the rest of the city or for business then this place is fine but if you're looking for something special and romantic then personally I would choose something well away from the airport and near the vast amount of beaches that are a 20-30 min drive away.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cReturning Aussie\u201d", "Author": "Doogal01", "ReviewID": "UR117571427", "Content": "I always stay at this hotel because it's close to LAX and the service & quality over the past six years has not declined.

The hotel is located within visual distance of LAX and there was a free shuttle that ran often between LAX and the hotel. The checkin was quick and polite and I was in my room in minutes. The room was spacious and clean. I had two issues that spoiled the hotel experience: poor maintenance of the room and the continuing attempt by hotels to \"unbundle\" expenses and change for minor services. The concept of \"unbundling\" is that the consumer is willing to pay for \"extra\" services. This might be the case with room service or personal service, but has morphed into a hotel holding it's hand out constantly for services and products that are excessive in relation to the direct costs to hotel. As to poor maintenance one would have to just look at the bathroom. The bathtub failed the mold test where mold had been covered with more caulk. This failure extended to paint on the rusted door hinges and the light fixture in the living area that just fell out of the ceiling. Finally, when the shower curtain was installed the tile was cracked and remain not repaired In regard to the petty unbundled expenses I would just point to the bottles of water on the desk with a sign about their neck with \"Got Thirst?\" in large letters and in much smaller letters the pricing of $3.00. Oh please-it is a bottle of no name water at room temperature. The little sign might have said $200 for the room - \"Got $3 more bucks?\" In the same line of abuse was the demand for $12.50 per day to receive WIFI service- clearly an odd pricing model considering the relative cost to the hotel. Lastly I should comment as to the Valet parking scheme where for $28 one can park for 24 hours, but not be assured that a place will be reserved if you leave during the day. There are a limited number of spaces and I watched 2 drivers and a supervisor move cars on an evening only to question the true profitability of valet parking, Considering all of these factors I think that one should find somewhere else to stay when in this area. I have to believe that one can do better for a similar pricing with better maintenance and less petty expenses.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus", "Title": "\u201cDid the job--quite well\u201d", "Author": "JordanF", "ReviewID": "UR117359251", "Content": "Stayed here for one night after a business meeting before an early morning flight.

Arlene was so SYMPATHETIC. She took one look at my attempts to be brave and upgraded me to a GORGEOUS suite. I couldn't believe it; when I walked in, I was floored. I stayed for an extra night, I loved the suite and its breathtaking views of planes landing. I also joined the Starwood Preferred Guest program, because she was so good to me. And I must say this: Although Arlene was STELLAR? Everyone I encountered helped to make me feel comfortable and welcome, including the discreet gentleman who brought my breakfast tray each morning. Why, even the shuttle drivers were delightful. The location was ideal for my conference and was very easy for my dear friends to find me. I am a neat freak (I always carry room cleaning products when I overnight) & found my suite spotless; I felt VERY comfortable in it. The free wireless Internet was fabulous, particularly because I attended a blogging conference and needed access at the conference and in my room! I am now considering a quick trip for my birthday.

There was a lot of loose hair in the bathroom, the mirror had water spots on it, and there were dirty towels hanging from the top of the shower. I basically felt as if the room had not been cleaned by housekeeping staff before my check in. I also felt like the front desk staff was not very welcoming. I felt like I was a burden to the staff by checking in. The welcome was not warm or informative. Nothing more occurred here other than an exchange of my ID, credit card and a room key. Not even an exchange of smiles. Even though I will not recommend this hotel, I would hate to say, \"don't stay here\" based on my single overnight experience.

The view was great, much nicer than the other LAX hotels I've stayed at and the amenties in the room and hotel are just super nice. The second time, Joseph remembered me! He very kindly secured an extremely nice room for me - when I went up and it was accidentally still being serviced, I went back down and he immediately accomodated me with another room that was on a lower floor, but was even nicer. He really went out of his way to please me as a customer. The hotel itself is beautifully set up and I have only had extremely positive and helpful interactions with the staff as they took care of my requests for internet and some packaging for my belongings.

Although we live in Los Angeles, we were having some work done at our house and so had to stay in a hotel while it was being done. Our insurance company gave us a choice of hotels and originally we had planned to split our stay between another hotel that was much closer to our house and ten minutes from our son's school and only spend the weekend at the Sheraton Gateway. However, after three days at the Gateway we decided it was well worth the drive (about 40 minutes in traffic) to instead book the entire 9 day stay at the Gateway. What can I say, the hotel is extremely well run and although it's busy it doesn't feel crowded or overwhelming. The lobby area is beautifully appointed and could easily be that of one of the trendier hotels on the Sunset Strip or in Beverly Hills. Nothing about this hotel suggests \"LAX\", from the incredible breakfast buffet, one of the best that I've had (and I've had many) to the five star Paparrazi restaurant where I dined on one of the best salmon in papillote that I've had, to the scrumptious chocolate lava cake. The pool is sparkling and well maintained and the cabana area is light and airy and so relaxing that I decided to take one day off and spend it by the pool. They also have an extremely well appointed fitness room as well as a convenient guest only complimentary internet \"cafe\" off of the lobby. Thanks to the management and staff at the Gateway I can truly say that the 9 days that I stayed there felt more like a vacation then any that I've taken recently where I've actually gone somewhere!

I have stayed at the hotel before and think it is one of the best in the airport area. If you are an aviation buff like myself, some of the airport view rooms have a great view of arriving and departing aircraft. The rooms are clean and very well appointed . The Club Floor is worth the extra money if you are arriving after a long haul flight as you can enjoy access to the lounge for snacks in the evening or continental breakfast in the morning. Free wifi is also available on the Club level. I have never had anything bad to say about this property however I did have a small issue with the bathroom this visit. Oddly enough I was in room 1565 both on my way to New Zealand and on the way back. During both stays (about 3 weeks apart) there was such a loud noise of air blowing quite forcefully through the air vent in the bathroom that the door to the bathroom had to be closed at all times. And when in the bathroom it was not only irritating but this constant flow of cold air that could not be controlled was very unpleasant. Especially when getting out of the shower. The bathrooms are definitely in need of some updating and this air vent issue needs to be addressed. My only other issue was with respect to the shuttle service from the airport terminals. For whatever reason (possibly just luck) it always seems as though the shuttle for the Sheraton LAX arrives at the airport shuttle stops much less frequently than the shuttles bound for the other airport hotel properties. Just an observation. I would still highly recommend this hotel to travelers stopping over and looking for a nice place to stay in the airport area.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lax", "Title": "\u201cThank you Diane Check\u201d", "Author": "ccovin", "ReviewID": "UR103090727", "Content": "I got what i needed almost before i hung up the phone.

I asked for a \"downgrade\" as it was a waste of money for non-existing services, despite the offer of an appertiser in the bar (at 12.45am) and a breakfast coupon. When the key did not work for the third room offered to me and I had hauled my luggage for the third time through the corridors, the clerk on the front desk, new on the shift, took me and my luggage to the room and apologetically did her best to placate me with the offer of a $50 credit on food - so I ordered room service. The 3 rating is for her making up for the less able clerk earlier in the evening who just did not get it! This is a very convenient hotel and has a great lobby with great wi-fi (I think it was even free) and very comfortable and private armchairs and chaise longues to pass the time between check -out and a late flight. I checked my bags with the bell boy and took the Ocean Trolley to Manhattan Beach and Manhattan Village and would say it was one of the best $5 buys I have made - again a great way to get away from LAX for a few hours without the hassle of renting a car, and there are great cafes by the ocean and friendly drivers on the Trolley which stops outside the Sheraton and good shopping at the Village trolley stop.

It only took a few minutes to get to the hotel. Check-in was great, all the staff there were really very nice and helpful. As I had asked for an early check-in our room was ready to go at 10 a.m.!!! This was so great because we were very tired after not sleeping for over 24 hrs. The room itself was really nice - as is the entire hotel. Not super large but large enough for the 4 of us and 4 enormous suitcases. The bathroom is a little on the small side but good enough - with a good shower with nice hot water that doesn't run out. The beds are extremely comfortable. There is no fridge in the room but a coffee machine was there. Also, no safe in the room but provided at the lobby. Breakfast at the restaurant cost $18 per person plus tax for a full breakfast buffet - which my family really enjoyed. There is also a restaurant for dinner which we didn't use and a bar which offers meals. We did have burgers here one night and it wasn't bad at all - cost about $15 per person. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby but we did not use this. There are no other restaurants nearby. I did see a Hungry Jacks a few blocks away. For the tourists, there is an Ocean Trolley stop at the front of the hotel which takes you to Manhattan Beach and two shopping centres for only $5. This was a great ride - even if you don't get off. Really worth doing - highly recommend it. We also did a day tour of LA with Starline Tours which picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. I'll do a separate review of this. The hotel also has a great (all new) gym which we enjoyed using and a heated pool which we ran out of time to use. Overall, this is a great hotel - especially for a short stay - not super luxurious (not like the Versace on the Gold Coast) but really very nice and very comfortable. The hotel has recently been refurbished and you can tell this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all new carpets, furniture and wall paper. The hotel did have a business centre in the lobby with free internet and free computers with printers to use - this was great. There is no free internet in the rooms however. One other important thing, there was no noise from the airport despite being just next door. Just to finish off, check out was a breeze and we only waited for a very short time for the free shuttle to take us back to LAX. If you are only in LA for a few nights, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really worth staying near LAX and doing tours from there. My family were all very happy to have stayed at this hotel and don't have any regrets or complaints - and I am sure that most people will agree with me.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "lisa1240", "ReviewID": "UR89275385", "Content": "Enjoyed all the amenities of this hotel, from check in to breakfast the next morning.

Check in was easy and check in attendant was friendly. The food in the hotel was so good! A little pricey, but that is to be expected at a hotel. We ordered food from the bar (calamari and salad), the balsamic romaine salad was one of the best I\"ve had. Also ordered pizza from room service which my boyfriend said was really good and I could tell he enjoyed it because he ate the entire thing. We also had lunch at the Brasserie, had a club sandwich and a salad which were also delicious. Parking was pretty cheap for being in the Los angeles area, about $12-13 dollars for the entire day with in and out privileges. Internet service was $11 which I thought was a bit pricey but we purchased anyways. The layout of the bar was probably one of my favorite things of the hotel. Lots of places to sit and tv's on each side of the bar to watch sports. Now, for the bad part...there were two bartenders when we were at the bar, and the older one was friendly and funny and took good care of us. However, the other bartender was really rude. He didn't make our drink correctly and when we politely asked if we could order something else instead because, he seemed to get angry and showed his irritation. We even saw him complain to the other bartender about us which I thought was very unprofessional. The only other negative thing, besides the bartender, would be the cleanliness of the bathrooms. There was a large dark brown spot/smudge (not sure what it was, nor do I want to know) at the base of the toilet and the shower. However, the guest service was so great, I would definately recommend this hotel. Our television didn't work, and witin 3 minutes, they had someone up to fix it. They also had someone deliver a room service menu within 3 minutes when we called and asked for one. The room service attendant who brought us our room was soo friendly and gracious.

For this rate this hotel is unbeatable. It has 820 rooms, a pool, and all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. It is located 5 mins to LAX. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start with the negative since I only have a couple. The shuttle service is extremely slow and you will wait for almost half an hour when they say it is only 15 mins. So make sure you allocate enough time when you rely on this shuttle service. I wouldnt bother with valet service as they are soooooo slow and I feel are inefficient. Just park in the lot behind the hotel on 98th stree for $13 in and out priviledges. Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is what makes this hotel shine especially the guest services folks nothing is too much to ask, if they can do it they will accommodate you. I especially want to mention Diane and Merlie Pickett, these two ladies provided me with the best service during my stay. I even stopped by to meet them in person. They go above and beyond. Rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are very clean and well appointed, modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor and oh so comfortable beds. It is very clean and the soundproofing is very adequate. I am a very light sleeper and I did not have any problems whatsoever. This hotel is along century blvd but they have rooms that are facing 98th street where the parking lots are located this is the quiet side. Housekeeping never forgets to clean up the room even when I ask them to clean it up later in the afternoon. The room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with a safe. It also doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with a refrigerator unless you request one and they would charge you for it. Even if the location of this hotel is by the airport if you have a car you can go to so many areas around it. Manhattan beach is 15 mins away and so is Marina del rey. If you plan to rent a car go with midway rental which is 2 blocks from this hotel, I had the best rate with that company although the battery died on the car on my last day. If you go left or right on Sepulveda blvd theres a lot of grocery, estabilishments etc I would definitely stay in this hotel again only if the price is around 150. You can get this through hotwire. Im not sure if I would pay more than 200 for this hotel. If you are looking for a hotel to WOW you this is not the one, if you are looking for a practical, clean, value for your money place then this is a great fit.

On to Business. Almost all rooms have a great internet connection. Important to me becuase I download huge files. The desks are a good size, but the office chairs are not adjustable for height. The phones all have speakerphones and 2 lines, however some of the phones really should be replaced. You can print in the lobby. Funny thing pring a mousepad. The Desks have a glass top. You will not be able to use a laser mouse without something underneath. The Stay: Well the beds are not as comfortable as some of the other Sheraton proprties, but I think they are fine. I've never had a problem with cleanliness in the room. The walls can be a bit thin, and I try not to get a room by the ice machine. Unless you have a room full of teen age girls next door it's usually fine on the noise. The airport noise you'll hear, but it's not so loud that it detracts from your stay. I love the room service staff, but I don't like much on the room service menu. For the price, I find some of the local delivery services (labites) offering better food for the same price as room service. They used to have a steak house which was much better than the current italian restaraunt. The gym is for a hotel Gym is pretty nice. It will get crowded in the morning. There is also a 24 hour fitness less than a 1/2 block up the street. The Area. Well it's the airport. There is not much to eat within walking distance except for other hotel restaraunts or fast food. Get in the Car and head south down Sepulveda. You have lots to eat around El Sugundo and Manhattan Beach, a 10 minute drive. There is a street call Rosencranz that has all kinds of shopping and dining options 15 minutes away heading south. Checking out. Usually pretty painless. They are not great about getting you a bill under your door. So if it's not there you can get one at the front desk. I don't know Why starwood just doesn't let you pull them online like Hilton does. The Airport shuttles are pretty much every 15 minutes. Pray you don't get on one with flight attendants. These little Diva's of sky like to hold up the shuttle becuase there is always one that can't get up on time so they drag out the process delaying hoping the person will finally get down so they can ride and sing kumbya togther. Meanwhile the security line they get to bypass and you don't is growing exponentially at 5 am. Nothing more frustrating than wathcing the second bus show up and leave while yours is waiting for a flight attendant. Anyhow you can pay much much more and get so much less in a hotel.

The rooms are large and a good standard of accommodation. The pool is nicely set for an airport hotel and the lobby with free wifi is spacious and comfortable.

We called for more towels but they didn't bring them until after we had to be ready to check out (two of us dried off with the hand towels). Not major issues but irritating at the time.

First off the Valet guys were very cocky and arrogant, and allowed another car to hit my car while it was parked. Thank God no damage was done! They blamed the other car for being a stick shift no realizing that they are in charge of all cars with keys in their possession. So, on Saturday night I guess some sorority had a function, and some students attended prom at the Sheraton and decided to pull the fire alarm on the 11th FL which caused everyone to wake up at 1:30-2 am. After discovering it was a false alarm the security of the hotel decided that it would be wise to sit by my door and talk with hotel guest while his walkie talkie was sounding. Needless to say, I got no sleep that night! I felt as thought it was college all over again. Lastly, housekeeping comes knocking on your door at 830-9am asking you what time can they clean your room (WTF!!!)! Some ratings give it a 4 star, and I will say no way.

It wasn't worse, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped. First, check in was average. Two SPG line front desk clerks on the phone, so I waited for a bit at checkin. Got my room, and went up. As reviews indicate bathroom average at best; bed was actually pretty comfy, and the size of the room not bad. Thank goodness for the AC/Fan, as it for the most part drowned out the airplane take off noise. My wake up call assurred to me at checkin never happened...good thing I was up early anyway, and my appointment wasn't until noon that Sunday. Good thing I didn't have a flight. The next morning,I took the shuttle back to the airport, then to Avis to rent my car for the next two days. I drove up to the valet and told him I would check out in an hour, and how much valet was. $10 he said. I asked if there was any self-park, and he said there was, behind the hotel, and the first 2 hours was free. After driving around quite a bit, I finally found the lot, in the paid traveler lot behind the hotel. At check out, an hour later, I asked about the free parking for 2 hours, and if I needed a ticket validated. The front desk stated she did not know, and she did not have to do anything. As I drove out, I was charged $8.25 because I didn't have a white ticket that the valet was supposed to give me! This is unacceptable, and I was quite mad--mad enough that I likely will try the Marriott or Embassy Suites down the street. Very disappointed in this hotel's service and noise.

This was my first trip to Los Angeles and I was traveling for business reasons so did not have a choice on where to stay. Here is what I thought about the property: Front Desk Check In: We arrived before the check in time and there was no wait at the front desk. The front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful and checked us into the rooms early because there were extra rooms available. Rooms: The room that I stayed in was a one bedroom standard non-smoking room with a king bed. Each room had a LG flat panel television, iron, ironing board, small recliner chair, and a desk to work on. At the Sheraton, unless you are a SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest Elite Status) member, wi-fi internet access in the rooms is not available free of charge. Wi-FI is available but will be charged to your room. I am not sure what the rate was for Wi-FI in the rooms but downstairs in the lobby area, pay internet was offered by the hotel for a fee of $6.95 for 15 minutes so I would assume that the price points would be similar. The beds were very comfortable and I found the sheets and pillow cases fresh and clean. No problems there. Lobby Area: The Sheraton has a very large lobby bar which was open most of the day into the evening hours. All around the lobby bar area were large contemporary looking benches that had lg flatpanel televisions that were playing various programming such as ESPN, and CNN. The lobby bar area was quite big and could accommodate a large amount of people. Pool Area: The pool at the Sheraton was really nice. Outside, they had tables and chairs set up along side poolside cabanas. Also, there was a hot tub located adjacent to the pool. I did not get a chance to swim in the pool because the weather was too cold at the time of my visit but it looks like a nice area for a quick dip during your stay. Restaurants/Room Service: I did not order room service but the menu did have a wide selection of items to choose from but was a little pricey $$$ for my budget. If you wanted something quick to eat, there is a subway right next store to the hotel. There is also a full service steakhouse located on the lobby level but is also $$$ and did not go into the restaurant. Finally, in the lobby area, there is a small sundry shop in which you could pick up small essentials that you may have forgotten at home as well as snacks, juices and soft drinks, ice cream bars, and small Los Angeles souveniers. The Sheraton is a nice property if you need to find a hotel near LAX which has great shuttle service to and from the airport.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service and resort like atmosphere at a airport location\u201d", "Author": "smpprule", "ReviewID": "UR63122698", "Content": "In times when the travel industry is lacking in the service department it is refreshing and pleasant to stay at a hotel that has exceptional customer service.

The room was nice and clean and we also stopped for a drink in the bar before we went out and the bar was quite nice. Where the hotel failed us was in customer service. After we returned to the hotel after the concert (at around 11 pm) the people in the adjoining room made so much noise that we couldnt sleep. After putting up with it for an hour or so we called the lobby to complain but the noise continued. Several more complaint calls and still nothing. At around 4 am after our final call we heard security come up and knock on their door and finally all was quiet. Unfortunately we had to be up at 8 am the next morning as we had plans with our friends. It was disappointing to pay for a hotel room to sleep in when we couldnt get any sleep! I sent a written complaint to the hotel after our stay but did not even get the courtesay of a response. While I understand this was mainly just bad luck on our part in that the people in the adjoining room were very noisey and this may have been a one off event, it certainly has deterred me from ever returning or recommending the hotel.

I had chosen this airport hotel as our last residence, on what was a fairly busy itinerary. I would be no stranger to Los Angeles while it was the nephews first visit. We had flown back again into LAX from Vegas late evening and it was so convenient to take the hotels courtesy shuttle bus, from the 'Courtesy shuttle bus pick up area' just outside baggage claim. Look for the sign. We had to wait a touch, but when we got picked up, we found ourselves at the hotel in no time at all, so really handy. Basically nearing the end of our holiday, I preferred a nice big hotel with a relaxing atmosphere, a stylish, spacious and comfortable room. I had requested a view towards the main runways, of which I managed to land !! There was not a lot going on in the area and I had expected this, so I wasn't disappointed. Moving away from our hotel, the green Metro lines Aviation / LAX stop is a short bus trip away. \"Big blue bus\" serves this stop also. Green Metro line links up with others, to cover much of LA city and I feel it is ( probably safe enough ? ), to decide to use, this form of public transport, providing it is not too late on at night. I did not feel too comfortable about some of the places it stops at and areas it passes through. Moving on, and back again to our hotel, theres also a few of them Big Burger type fast food chains not too far away. Our allocated room was modern, it had lots of room, a large screen TV ( convenient for watching the Rose Parade on New Years morning ) a large writing desk, few big comfortable lounging chairs, etc. We were supplied with a Queen size bed each and neither of us seemed to have any trouble falling to sleep. A good nights sleep was assured, even though the hotel is near airport. No concerning issues, I was able to easily check-in for our Long haul direct flights back to London Heathrow, from the hotels facility ( computer was located next to the hotels own Starbucks coffee shop ! ) The concierge folk, I must point out, were very helpfull too. We enjoyed relaxing by the outdoor swimming pool, prior to the hotels courtesy shuttle coach, returning us to LAX, in good time. The pool, jacuzzi, nice surrounding greenery, also made for a relaxing, indeed peacefull, pre-flight environment.

One valet told us to park alongside a curb, then his supervisor curtly directed us to move: Lots of attitude from him. Not the usual quality of Sheraton employee. The desk staff was OK - not warm, but in no way hostile, either. Just efficient and perhaps uninterested in dealing with a Priceline customer. That's sometimes the price of a bargain rate. The upside: Rooms are immaculate, modern and fresh. Quality, plush furnishings. Quiet. Lobby is upscale and new. Outstanding pool, hot tub (under an enormous tree) and sun deck - they work hard to achieve a sort of West Coast/European trendy feel, which is no easy matter in an airport hotel. For some reason you've got to walk past the upscale bar/restaurant to get there - ?? The business travelers in suits end up having parades of sunbathers wander past. Oh well.

I booked this hotel for about 5 nights during my summer vacation when I came back home for a visit. I booked this hotel through Hotwire, so I didn't know which hotel I would be staying in until I entered my credit card info and paid. It said 4 star hotel, but in reality the hotel itself was more of a 3 star hotel with 2 star service. However I only paid about $80/night for the room and I think the self service parking was like $12 a day or something like that. The room itself was pretty good, with large bed and contemporary furniture. One of the few problems I had with the room was the bathtub. As other reviewers have mentioned, there was the problem of slow water drainage and the tub was a little chipped around the drain. The other problem was that there was a door that separated my room to the room next door, and you could hear the family next door with their noisy kids, whenever they were in their room. Other than those things, I was generally satisfied with the room itself. However, the main problem was the service. At the front desk, the staff seemed a bit aloof and unprofessional at times. Quite frankly, some of them (even though they were dressed professionally) spoke and acted a bit \"ghetto\" and it seems like they weren't trained in proper etiquette. That wasn't the main issue though. The main problem was that I had requested a small fridge to be sent to my room 3 times. The first 2 times, I had called the front desk and they told me it would be there in 30 minutes. 1.5 hours later...no fridge. SO I called again and spoke to the same guy and he sounded surprised that it hadn't come yet and said he would call maintenance to see what was going on. Another 30 minutes passed by and nothing. So I went outside my room and saw one of the housekeeping ladies and explained to her my problem. She was really nice and on a walkie talkie informed another man of my problem, and within about 15 minutes, they had brought up the fridge and set it up. So, the housekeeping and maintenance people did a good job, but the \"unprofessional/ghetto\" front desk person didn't. I think he was just being lazy. I wonder who hired that guy and I'm guessing their criteria for hiring hotel staff must be quite low. The hotel itself was just ok. The pool could have been in better condition, and the fitness room was being renovated, so the temporary fitness room was tiny. The elevators do shake a bit. The only other comment I have was of the shuttle driver. He was a really nice and funny man. I think he must have been Latino and I forgot his name, but he made the trip from the airport to the hotel very fun. I hope they pay him well. However, I think the shuttle is not just for the Sheraton hotel but for other hotels in the area as well. But overall, for $80/night it was a decent value I think.

I rang down to reception to see if there was a trick and they offered to send some one from maintenance up. He was there within 5 minutes and for roughly 10 minutes attempted to fix it. He then said he would have to move us to another room and quickly rang down to reception and found out that the room next door was empty. He let us in to the room and offered to help us move of things. He turned on the A/C for us and then arranged for a porter to bring up the new room keys for us. It was all very organised and very friendly. We had a brilliant nights sleep in a wonderfully comfortable and huge bed and woke up watching the planes landing at LAX. We couldnt hear a sound as they landed but it was great to watch them. We had breakfast at the subway down the road and then checked out. The hotel held our luggage and we brought tickets for the Ocean Express shuttle which leaves from just outside the hotel and takes you to the beach and 2 shopping centres for $3 each return.

I have written many reviews concerning Starwood properties here on tripadvisor - and in not a single one have I had a negative thing to say about the hotel in question. But, this experience was not all that wonderful. I was taking a 16 hour flight from SE Asia and I wanted to secure a nice room for my wife and son who I had not seen for a couple weeks. I took the time to call the hotel from Thailand the night before, at my expense, to make the pre-arrangements to ensure everything would be set up upon my arrival late into the evening. As a Starwood platinum member, I had hoped that the arrangements that were agreed upon between myself and a manager at the hotel the night before would be carried out without a hitch. This did not happen. I will spare the details of the very disappointing situation i encountered when I arrived at the hotel- suffice it to say that the treatment I received was unbecoming of a guest to this hotel, not to mention a Platinum SPG guest. HENRY GARAY stepped into the picture and treated me in a professional manner, doing the absolute best he could to remedy the situation. While he could not provide me with the room I was promised, he did everything in his power to make me comfotable and I greatly thank Henry. I strongly suggest that if you are a gold or platinum SPG member that you ONLY ask to speak with Henry. He is a gentleman and a professional at what he does - HE TRULY CARES ABOUT THE HOTEL GUEST. Upper management of this hotel - please try to get all of your staff to treat gusts the way Henry Garay does. My general comments about the hotel: (1) elavators are very slow - management should try to figure out a way to get a specific elevator up to the higher floors; (2) Club lounge breakfast was nice; (3) be careful if you want to go to the steakhouse in the hotel as my family did on Sunday night - it was closed; (4) clean rooms; (5) very convenient to LAX airport, especially with free shuttle; (6) fairly priced; (7) staff just not as friendly as most other Sheratons I have encountered, excluding Henry Garay.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast, AU", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for one night airpot overnight\u201d", "Author": "GreenCardWedding", "ReviewID": "UR34959946", "Content": "I booked this hotel on priceline (given hotel after they accepted my bid).

We checked in about 11 AM with no problem and no line. As someone mentioned, the elevators are slow because the two elevator banks are not connected so you have to hit the button on both elevators. This means that during almost every elevator ride, the elevator opens up without anyone getting on. Use the 3 elevator bank as we found that to be the fastest. Our room was on the 10th floor and we had a view of the LAX parking lots. We heard some plane noise but it was not disturbing. The beds were so comfortable. The bathroom is a bit small and needs renovation but it did the job. The one thing that we all noticed was that the room was very dusty. It looks like the cleaning staff doesn't dust the rooms.

Upsides were that the TV was a large flat screen, and the bathroom was very clean. However, there was no fridge or microwave in the room which was very disappointing. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. The bar and restaurant are very expensive ($7 for a light beer). There are no major restaurants close by but a 10 min walk with get you to a local shopping centre with lots of choices.

I was amazed at the noise in our hallway at 3.00am in the morning. Also the room next door had his TV up full tilt at 5.00am in the morning so we had a couple of restless nights. I knocked on the door of the room next door but they wouldn't answer. However, the TV was turned down so presumably they knew what they were doing wrong. There is one thing that really annoys me with these upmarket hotels. Given that they charge exhorbitant prices for the room, one would think they would give their 'executive guests' free internet access. In much cheaper hotels internet is often offered free along with breakfast. It was a rip off at $10.95 and to make it worse the connection kept dropping out in our room. Meaning I had to go to the lobby to use it. To their credit, when I mentioned it at the desk they immediately offered us another room. I declined because we were settled in where we were.

For the level of hotel, the price was hard to beat. Also, the decor of the hotel fits my personal style and so I loved the feel of the place. The bar was awesome and Shula's 347 restaurant inside the hotel was amazing (pricey, but amazing)! The beds are super comfy and the pool area was very nice too, the location was great since our vacation had us traveling all over the LA area. That being said there are some definite problems with this hotel, in fact, if I was someone who could afford their normal room rates, I would absolutely think this hotel was the pits! First, there is NO FREE PARKING whatsoever. That's pretty normal for Los Angeles but the Valet at the Sheraton is the biggest rip off I've ever heard of in my entire life! It's around $25.00 if you valet over 15 minutes!!!! If you elect to self park, it's $13.20 per night. Make sure you add that on top of your room rate when budgeting your vacation. The hotel messed up my bill which added insult to injury, they failed to charge me for my hotel bar tab but then charged me for a week of valet parking I didn't use. When I tried to fix the issue and was honest about not being charged for the bar tab, they blamed me and I had to deal with three different people to get it fixed. The bathrooms are a bit scuzzy considering the rest of the hotel and the TV's need to be updated. Also, it appears they have been having elevator issues for a long time now with only 2 of the 6 working so you have to take the service elevator. The brasserie for breakfast is overpriced and the service is super slow, I was shocked how bad it was in comparison to Shula's the night before. I recommend avoiding a handicapped accessable room as well. I would probably stay here again but It would have to be an even better deal than the one I got.

This is a 5-10 minute walk in relative dark at night. Shuttle to parking lot is inconsistent. Can park on street behind hotel but you might get a ticket during day. 3. INTERNET FEES: $10.95 per day. True that internet is free in the lobby area (which is quite large). Otherwise, the hotel is fine. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. I can't figure out how anyone can stay at an airport hotel and then complain about hearing airplanes?! Bring earplugs or noise machine. Color scheme? Yes, kind of dark but this shouldn't ruin your stay! Long check-in line? I checked in very quickly.

At least California has banned the use of hand held cell devices while driving and I really think that has helped their traffic situation. I wish Texas would do the same. The room was large enough, our A/C worked very well, there was plenty of hot water, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear any noise. You can hear the occasional rumble of planes taking off but its not something that bothered me. Also I didnt hear any noise from other guests. I sleep with ear plugs in so noise is a non issue for me anyway. The hotel has a heated pool and my daughter got in that one evening. It was chilly and she said the water temp was perfect. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care for the fact that the hotel charges $25 a day to park your vehicle. Its valet parking and they do have self parking (for $6-$9 a day, cant remember for sure) but its located in the back of the hotel and I would not have felt safe walking alone at night with my 9 year old from where it was located at. It would have been a very dark walk. The hotel also charged per day for internet access which is annoying but most hotels with star rating charge for internet access. I think it was either $9 or $15 for a 24 hour period. There are not any restaurants around this hotel but there are some just up the road. I did not try the onsite restaurant so I have no idea how that is. Also beware when making u-turns on the road in front of the hotel. I got a ticket for making an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd u-turn there.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cClean and quiet\u201d", "Author": "TexasTravelerAustin", "ReviewID": "UR16802511", "Content": "Stayed here during a 12-hour layover at LAX.

Although I wasn't terribly impressed with the amenities of the hotel (there was only one restaurant opened when we got there and it was the most up-scale, when we just wanted an evening snack, the gift shop was not opened at 10PM) the main problem was with the bathtub. It was completely covered in small black spots. At first I thought it was paint spattered on the bottom of the tub, but I rubbed it, and it smeared! It was the consistency of charcoal. Of course, I called the front desk and the immediate response was, \"I'm sorry, we don't have any other rooms available.\" I insisted that housekeeping come up and clean the tub. A nice gentleman came very quickly and cleaned, then asked me to come look and approve the work. The tub was spotless. I thanked him and asked what the stuff was. His only response was, \"It's nasty, isn't it?\" I agreed that it was, but at least the tub was clean so I didn't say anything else. Imagine my surprise when the next morning the tub was in exactly the same condition as it had been when we arrived the night before!! The photos that accompany this review were taken in the morning, AFTER the tub had been cleaned and appeared spotless 8 hours earlier. I wish now that I would have called the Health Department and waited until they got there, but I wanted to get started on my vacation. I put a towel down and took my shower.

Very well maintained as opposed to some of the reviews I've read on Trip Advisor. Our room was pretty clean, the hotel public space was pretty clean as well. One note, it took housekeeping at least two days to notice some nut shells in a public hallway on the 3rd floor. I actually thought that wasn't bad because I notice everything (other guests probably didn't even realize the shells were there) and that was the only housekeeping concern that I had in a public space. As far as the room goes my only issue was the comforter, it had a stain on it but I never use them anyway so I just took it off the bed but wanted to wait and see if housekeeping would notice it and replace it with a clean one. They didn't so on my 2nd night there I asked that it'd be replaced and they responded very quickly to this request and any others that I had. Other areas like the hot tub needed to be cleaned as well and the elevators were very slow and probably needed to be serviced; experienced a situation where several guests including myself were stuck on the 1st floor because the doors did not shut properly, a guest had to pull the doors open to reset them. I never reported this incident. Though we had some minor issues service was great, the restaurant was great, the room ultimately was very comfortable, beautiful decor and furnishings. I would stay again and more than likely will soon. My biggest problem with the Sheraton Gateway is parking...yes we've read this before, it is a headache. First off, we did choose to park valet the first day due to schedule constraints...it was just convenient at the time. On the next two days that we had a rental we chose the Sheraton/LAX lot behind the hotel. It was very inconveniently located. My husband had to shuttle back to the hotel after parking the car!! Then, on the day we checked out I noticed we were charged for valet for 5 days instead of 1...we didn't even have a car on the last three days of our stay.

What looked like a twenty minute line for coffee turned out to be a five minute wait at the most. Kudos to them! In spite of being an extremely busy airport hotel the elevators were prompt and speedy even early in the morning when they often bog down at most hotels. I had occasion to use the fitness center and found the cardio equipment to be very good, the weight gear is just ok. The only real gripes we could think of was a $6 charge to use the lobby computers, a bit of a silly rip-off of paying guests needing to print a boarding pass. Also, a little fridge in the room would be nice. The free shuttle to Manhattan Beach for shopping and beach stuff is a wonderful service. Several times we stopped by the hotel just to freshen up between engagements and I had expected a hassle from the staff about parking in front for a few minutes. They had no problem with it, and I very much appreciated that. For overnight parking we used the self parking lot behind the hotel. That was reasonably priced for the airport and in a handy location, although the attendants (not Sheraton people) were invariably rude and functioned at glacier speed, which is why we preferred to park in front for brief stop ins. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on that. All in all, a fine choice at LAX. One last recommendation: Uncle Bills in Manhattan Beach for breakfast.

Shuttle service from the airport was great; I only had to wait a few minutes for it. The less positive aspects of this hotel: the bathroom was a little small and didn't have a wall mirror or lighted stand mirror as some hotels do, so it was a little hard to see close up in the big mirrors. My primary complaint, though, was that even in a non-smoking room, there was a vague smell of stale cigarette smoke--enough so that I had to buy some air deodorizer and also use a couple of scented candles. Of course, I really shouldn't complain about anything, since I stayed for free with points from the Starwood Preferred Guest program. But since one can get a good rate even through the hotel website, and given the airport convenience, quick shuttle, comfy bed, and hotel quietness, I'll definitely stay here again when I'm in LA.

I could see the pool from my room and it looked nice but I didnt go down. Since I got to the hotel so late, the only thing I could pretty much get for food was room service. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad and a french onion soup. Let me tell you, this was THE BEST room service I have ever ordered. They came promptly. Along with what I ordered, they brought me 4 pieces of warm, fresh, crusty fench bread with butter. Also a tall ice water with lemon. Deff didnt expect that and it was very nice!

The coffee pot didn't work and needed to be replaced, as did a light bulb and the tv remote batteries. Obviously they reserve this room for their \"special Hotwire\" customers! Now to the service we received here: the breakfast restaurant was fine, very cheerful, prompt, and the food was good. $40 for breakfast was a bit much, but it was our first day, so we weren't quibbling. Later that afternoon we tried to get a drink and food at one of the lounge tables, but with only one entirely inadequate cocktail waitress on a Saturday afternoon, we finally had to go to the bar to pay $20 for a vodka martini and a virgin bloody mary. Yikes! When we finally got our food, it was good, however - one of the best quesadillas I've ever had. The next night we ate at Shula's 347, thbe beautiful hotel steakhouse. Now, it was a Sunday night - not busy at all - and there were diners interspersed throughout the restaurant, but nobody sitting too close to anybody else. We were sat at a table for two in an otherwise deserted part of the restaurant - deserted, that is, until the hostess sat a man with his 5 year old daughter RIGHT NEXT TO US and then promptly seated a single guy who must have gotten his lobster eating technique from Darryl Hannah in \"Splash\" - yes, he crunched his way through the tail, then spit the shell out on the plate. Granted, his dining habit wasn't the hostesses fault, nor was the whining 5 year old, but her placement in a sparsely populated restaurant left MUCH to be desired.So while Dad and the kid worked thier way through $5 of mac n cheese, our $140 meal was ruined. It doesn't take much brains or training to spread the groupings around. The waitress forgot the wine, the bus person wanted to take our plates every five minutes, even when we weren't done. The food was good - very good, in fact. Such a shame their customer service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Oh, and then there was the $50 room service breakfast of lox and english muffins (not a bagel, as the menu said) and a $12 croissant and cup of coffee. One shouldn't expect to get off cheaply on room service, but when you're paying those kind of prices, one should expect the order to be right and adequately substantial. $21 a day for valet parking was a bit much as well.

Check in was quick and staff were very couteous. The room was ready straight away. We had a lovely room over looking the pool area and the airport runways. There was very little noise for a hotel so close to such a busy airport. The room was very tastefully furnished and very clean. The Concierge(s) was very helpful and would go out of his way to give good advice. He even advised us that we could buy tickets to the Dodgers' game on the internet far cheaper than he could get them for us. The hotel shop had a good range of essentials and some of their souveniers were cheaper than in the downtown stores. My son and husband spent a lot of time at the pool area. The pool was clean and the hot tub was also well maintained. There were always staff on hand to replenish towels and generally keep an eye on everything. The towels were large grey and white striped beach towels which was a very nice touch. We did not eat at Shulas but did use the bar menu to eat by the pool. The menu was limited but the food was good as was the food ordered from room service. The room service staff were delightful. We did not eat at the Sushi Bar either as we are not huge fans but it seemed popular. Breakfast from the buffet was good and plentiful and we felt it was very reasonably priced. This hotel is located a long way from anywhere except the airport which is a disadvantage for a long stay as cab fares are horrendous - $45 one way to Dodgers' Stadium. A car would have been helpful and we would rent one if we were staying for the same period of time next time. However, bus fares are cheap and a ride to Santa Monica or Long Beach is $1.50 round trip. A trip to Downtown LA will cost $3.00 for an all day pass. The bus station is 5 minutes walk behind the hotel. Make sure you have the exact money. We also found that it was easy to walk up Sepulveda Ave to the shops - about 20 minutes walk - or the bus will take you there also. There are quite a few cafes, department stores and supermarkets there. We also got wise and checked out the neighbouring hotels for more food choices. If you are desperate, there is a Subway outlet next door and other fast food outlets close by. My only gripe with this fine hotel was that when I ordered a cup of tea by the pool, I was charged $4.00 for a very small pot of semi boiling water and a tea bag! We stayed at a neighbouring hotel on our night before returning to Australia, and believe me, the Sheraton wins hands down. Everything at the Sheraton is professional and we were always treated with the utmost respect. A tip: If you are clastophobic as I am, elevators are always a bother. The elevator doors at the Sheraton Gateway are slow at opening, so don't panic!", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHotel very nice\u201d", "Author": "sra225", "ReviewID": "UR4117769", "Content": "We stayed here the last night of our California vacation.

Had time in the morning to look around a little, and I must say that the pool area is as nice as any I've seen at an airport hotel. The only unpleasant surprise was a problem at Shula's with bugs floating in my cocktail. Apparently they had gotten into the liquor bottle.

I was forced to park in the hotel's off-site parking lot, where they charge more for hotel guests with in and out priveleges ($13/day) than someone not staying at the hotel ($11/day). You'd think they'd give their hotel guests a break. Since I am a woman and I was travelling by myself, I didn't relish having to hike back to the hotel late at night from the parking lot. They have a shuttle from the parking lot to the hotel, but you still have to sit at the shuttle stop for quite a while until the shuttle comes. The second night I stayed, the valet parking was also full. The reception check-in was extremely rude. I had purchased the hotel stay on Priceline and this proved that internet-paying guests are treated poorly. He said he couldn't guarantee a non-smoking room since I had booked through the internet. I told him that there was no way I could have a smoking room since 1) I'm allergic to smoke and 2) I'm 4 months pregnant. He \"happened to have two non-smoking rooms left.\" When I arrived at the room, the carpets were damp as if they had just been cleaned. When I called to complain, they said they'd send someone up to dry them. Housekeeping came up with a tiny fan that was meant to somehow dry the entire room of its damp floors. I told them I didn't think that would work and asked if they could just set down towels. I ordered room service and both the woman who took my order and the delivery man were very friendly and professional. After the bad experience I had so far, I really appreciated it. The room was clean, but definitely no-frills. Very few amenities -- not even bottled water in the room or a mini bar. The bathroom was looking very worn -- cracks in the tub and the the sink did not drain well. The next morning I had breakfast at \"The Brasserie.\" The service was very good. Besides their food service, this hotel should make a lot of improvements before it can call itself a 4-Star hotel.", "Date": "October 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood stay at the airport!\u201d", "Author": "usafan", "ReviewID": "UR3996737", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Gateway. Large, clean rooms and the beds were very comfortable. They were the best beds during our 21-day round trip. The only negative i can say about this hotel is the parking situation. They have no self parking lot, only valet. They have no check in parking available, so you have to carry your luggage from the nearby airport parking lot or discuss with the valet parking personal to get 5 minutes to unload. The whirlpool also wasn't very good. So, choose this hotel as an airport hotel for the night before or after your flight, for that it couldn't be better. But it is not a resort-like hotel to stay more than a few days. All in all, it was a good experience and i recommend it.", "Date": "October 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3933039", "Content": "Booked through priceline for $85/night.

We were exhausted after our 10.5 hour flight so would have expected better sound proofing from this highly rated hotel. 2 The bathroom's toilet roll holder was coming off the wall. 3 Shular 357 is over priced - $10 for a bottle of sparkling mineral water! 4 Receptionist not very friendly/helpful as she insisted on taking my hotel voucher and only after my insistence would she give me a photo copy.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rocky Hill, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGood, but could be better\u201d", "Author": "bp4559", "ReviewID": "UR3790484", "Content": "One walk through the facility and you would say this place gets a 5 star review, but upon further review there were little problems that kept adding up, which ultimately resulted in me giving it 4 stars. The parking here is a nightmare, valet is expensive and although self parking is cheaper (13 dollars per day) it is annoying. Many times we grabbed the last or next to the last spot. There were several times when there was a long line waiting to get out and the situation became disorganized. Another problem is housekeeping, it took them forever to do our room, it was 1:30 in the afternoon and it still wasn't done. The elevators were broken during our time there, it wasn't that bad of a problem for us because we were on the third floor, but it could become a big problem for someone on a higher floor. Another thing I didn't like about this place was that the shower head was too low and I nearly hit my head on it a couple of times and I'm only 5-6. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pool area was very good as well. What's good is you can order drinks and take them out by the pool. The pool tended to get crowded in the afternoon.The room service food was good and I also liked the bar there too. One thing about room service that I really liked was it is 24 hours, which is great when you are looking for something to eat at midnight. Shula's was expensive but the steak was good.

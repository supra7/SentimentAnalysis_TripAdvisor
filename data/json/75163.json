This place is dirty, carpets stained, crud on the floors and corners in the bathroom, light bulbs missing from the lamps and cracked walls and ceilings, not to mention the traffic from the elevated bridge right outside our window - 15 feet... Breakfast left a lot to be desired - generic yogurt, rcie crispies and corn flakes, big bowl of grape jelly, no jam, marmalade, etc. Got to say that the home made nut bread was pretty good.

Set into a lively neighborhood and close to the Miami River, with a park nearby and some very good restaurants within walking distance, the Inn is a quiet oasis of older, well kept buildings surrounding a lush tropical garden. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, our rooms were well appointed, comfortable, and clean, the kids loved chasing lizards around the grounds, and the cats reminded us of Hemingway's Key West. Though full, as evidenced by the number of guests (from around the US and the world!) that we met either at the lovely breakfast served in the garden or later in the day during our daily swim in the pool, we felt as if we had the place to ourselves. Thanks to the staff for their recommendations, as the eating establishments and activities suggested only added to our visit. Walking over the drawer bridge and traveling on the \"people-mover\" (worth the ride just for the sights, particularly the lights of the city at night) added to our fun and we would have missed both (and a few great meals) without their suggestions.

We rode metromover, 4 blocks from the Inn, to every part of the city. We walked to and fro from the Inn through every neighborhood, feeling very comfortable. Within 10 blocks of this Inn, IS, everything you can do in Miami to entertain yourself, be entertained and eat like no where else, anywhere.

The Inn has been operating as an Inn since the beginning of Miami, over a 100 years ago and in a sense, it shows. What I mean is that it is an old wood building furnished with antiques, and with all the usual quirky issues of a National Register historic property. I found a couple small places that need touch-up paint, but overall the buildings are in better shape than many of the chains I've stayed in for twice as much. My room was clean and comfy. My TV was tiny but I didn't visit Miami to watch television; it did suffice to catch up on the weather and the free wi-fi worked well. My shower was hot, and the AC was cold. The pool was very nice, as was the garden and veranda by the breakfast nook, which served homemade nut bread with coffee and fruit and yogurt. The neighborhood is a working family neighborhood with joggers, fishermen, kids going to school, etc., and several parks within walking distance, but not dangerous by any measure; check with staff about parking options. Also w/in walking distance (5 min) was Jamon Jamon Jamon, a wonderful tapas bar and restaurant (best anchovies I've ever had!). There is a sports bar/tropical bar on the river with a beautiful view of downtown reflecting on the water. Across the street is a working waterfront for lobster and stone crab, which you can get fresh at Garcia's restaurant over the bridge. The helpful staff arranged a cab for early in the morning and it took us 15 min to get to the airport. If you want a great location, want great staff, want something pretty and unique, this is it.

It is inspired by a few recent reviews which reveal unrealistic expectations and failure to appreciate what the Inn has to offer. Instead of one reviewer's \"quaint country inn\", one finds a fenced, gated compound at the southwest corner of the intersection where the Flagler drawbridge crosses the Miami River. Across the river are downtown skyscrapers, across the road are a seafood operation, a park and a playground, while Little Havana lies to the south and west. The compound includes an off-street parking area, a courtyard with swimming pool, and four clapboard two-storey buildings built in 1906 with porches, living rooms, and 38 guestrooms with private baths. It is ringed by tall palm trees, guarded by a resident group of ten or twelve cats, carries an historic designation, and is within walking distance of local and downtown restaurants. It is also a relatively quiet and peaceful spot in an otherwise bustling urban setting. Beside peace and quiet, we find that the Inn's location provides ready access to Miami's highway network and that those who man the front desk ... Jane, Carlos, and Metris... are friendly and sufficiently knowledgeable to provide good directions and direct guests to worthwhile restaurants. Also, this is not a place with paper-thin walls and noisy, incponsiderate neighbors. (For those who may be disturbed by outside noise, I suggest that you choose a south or west-facing room). Finally, room rates are relatively low. Guests will therefore get value for money, which is all too rare in big cities.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGave it a shot\u201d", "Author": "Deenie0917", "ReviewID": "UR119909906", "Content": "I read several reviews before booking and gave this place a try to be away from the fancy miami hotels.

Second of all the outside is very run down, the \"E\" in the name is falling off, the paint all chipped and needs repairs done. The outside furniture is dirty and mouldy. Inside it has charm when you first walk in, it has that old inn musky smell which gave it character. The room was small and we felt like we were in a cute doll house. The view was of another building and the fire escape. The tv was a 9-10 Inch and had no remote and very limited stations. Our bathroom was dirty, hair from the previous person was around the tolet base and the sink. 30 minutes after we arrived there were over a dozen ants (large red one) all over the bathroom and came into the bedroom. there was some kind of dead fly/ant shells and dirty on the spare toilet roll. There was no hair dryer in the room. The next morning we got up and a huge cockroach was walking around on our sink. We walked around. the property and it was very rundown and nothing at all like the pictures. The view of the river was hidden by a lobster ship yard.

I felt like I had to keep looking over my shoulder for fear that someone would mug me on my way to the black gate. You can't just walk in either. You have to ring the bell which is located on the left side. As you go up the steps you see skinny cats and there about 3 or 4 of them. There was trash on the inside of the gate around the back. The place looks old and it smells like old furniture that's been sitting in storage. It's very stuffy in there and dusty. I felt trapped like I couldn't breath. The guy shows me to my room which is located in another building. The furniture is out dated, the quilts had stains on it, and the bed is uncomfortable. There were little ants all on my sink, the shower was absolutely disgusting and there were dead ants in the corner of the shower. There was a dead bug under my bed. I refused to lay in the bed for fear of bed bugs. The TV was old and dusty and there was no remote. I went back to the front desk to see if I could change rooms and no one was there. There was a sign that read if I needed assistance to call 320 which I did numerous times and I got no answer. When I wanted to leave I couldn't because my car was locked in the gate and once again no one was there to let me out. I wound up staying with a friend that night and the next day I went to check out even though I paid $227.78 for 2 days. I explained to the guy that the hotel was unsatisfactory and also tried to explain why. He acted as if he didn't care about what I had to say, got nasty with me, and cursed me. When I demanded that I speak to his manager he said he wasn't there and that I could reach him through email only.

Miami River Inn is a little touch of something else. Its more like a Bed and Breakfast/Guest House in many ways. Its a small collection of large historic houses all on the same grounds. Coupled with the amazing weather in Miami, it gives a colonial/tropical feel. Each room is individual and kitted out in a kitch fashion, an earlier time period than art deco. Its large enough that they have room for a good few guests but small enough that that it still keeps that personal touch. A brilliant example is this is when we arrived we were greeted by the owner and Norman the dog (cute 8 year old). She had time to shoot the breeze with us whilst I rubbed Norman's belly. I hadn't read up on it before hand but its a 'green' hotel which I was also impressed with as so much in Miami is about excess. Before you ask, no it doesn't mean dirty sheets or baths, it just means being conscientiousness as a hotel in some of their choices. And this relaxed, well meaning attitude resonates through out the hotel. Its like going round to your favourite aunt's house. A warm and caring reception. I don't want to give the wrong impression here, they do the things I feel are necessary in a hotel these days. They are organised, clean, have wi fi, AC, private parking, pool... but they do what the bigger (and even some of the smaller chains) Hotels forget/miss out on and that's personalty and real care.

The bed in our room was beyond unacceptable-we could feel the broken springs in the mattress along with a very obvious hump in the middle of the bed - clearly not replaced (maybe ever) very uncomfortable. The pillows on the bed were so TERRIBLE-one was soooo flat you could roll it up into a tight roll - been there for way too long maybe - eewww! There were 3 of us in our room & they only left 2 old towels (no washcloths at all) and the towels were FOUL! They left a horrible smell on our skin when drying off after bathing - disgusting! I called the front desk repeatedly and got nothing but the answering machine & never got a call back or response. (This was all the 1st day!) I thought we should try 1 more day just in case they had an 'off' day or something (my spouse was not of the same mind, but we tried it). Day 2 towels were JUST as gross! We had to dry off with hand towels, and still they only left 2 towels.....Again no response from front desk & no one even at the front desk when we went there! (both times it was in the evening around 9 pm but someone should have been attending!) No call back whatsoever. What if there was an emergency!!!???? Moving on to the breakfast....the little bldg that you go into was run down and not very clean inside, there were sugar ants all over the countertops & dirty dishes in the sink....the refrigerator handle in there was also very dirty, I personally look at those things for indications of cleanliness in a facility. The food was cold cereal (corn flakes/raisin bran?), yogurt, bananas, toast & bagles & coffee cake....I cannot eat dairy so, I couldn't eat anything much other than the coffee cake and sad to say, it had obviously been in the fridge for some length of time as the flavor had picked up the icky fridge air! One bite and I had to throw it away. There was, of course, no non-dairy creamer for the coffee. We had to go out to eat, both days. They should indicate that it's not a 'breakfast' but instead, just a continental. We could not do another night - we'd had enough. Our short vacation was being marred by the bad service & accomodations of this B&B. Whenever I travel I always check B&B's first - we are big fans and have stayed at many over the years! But this was was an absolute bust. I spoke with the owner of the Inn about all of these things upon checking out & was surprised that she did not even offer to compensate us for anything at all. Not very good business in my opinion. The antique furniture around was awesome & beautiful, but I thought the room textiles decor (bed & window treatments) was dated and did not even have that 'antique' feeling, just old.

There is some noise from the adjacent highway overpass but depending on the room not bad for an in-city hotel. Our room was upstairs in the main building.

The bed basically was shot but tolerable. The main asset of the place is historic character and the really nice shaded property, landscaped back yard, and breakfast. A movie with a scene about a quaint b&b was shot here a few days before we stayed - so that tells you something about the overall look of the place.

The bathroom was questionably clean, found some brown sticky stuff on toilet tank lid. No plug for sink. This B&B is like an Oasis in a not really good area of Miami so you need a key to lock you car in the adjacent lot and a key to get into the fenced-in house, which brings us back to our arrival. There was no one at the front desk to answer phone calls or see us trying to get into the locked fence. Had this nice couple not come along and let us in, we would have had to find another place to stay.

Minuses would be the lack of a shower (just a bath) in our room , no maid service on Sunday and the rather ugly fence surrounding the grounds. Given the other reviews on this site, I wasn't sure what to expect of the neighborhood.

From what I can tell, if you're used to diverse, urban settings, you'll find Little Havana an interesting place to explore. If you're from the suburbs and assume that anyone who speaks Spanish is probably a criminal, you'll be beter off at the more controlled setting of the resorts at Orlando or South Beach.

The beds were dirty, there were cobwebs everywhere, and the room was so dusty it was hard to breathe. We asked to be moved to a different room. It was obvious that the man at the counter was very agitated with us, but he moved us to another room. This next room looked better, so we decided to just relax and watch TV. My friend went in to take a shower. A couple of seconds into getting ready for the shower, she says \"what kind of bugs are these?\" Now having recently lived in Florida, when someone says bug, you know what it is. But I went in and looked just to be sure, and yes it was. There were roaches in the bathtub. Now anyone who knows about roaches in the south, knows that the only ones you really have to worry about are the little ones that infest. Well that is what they were. Immediately we called another hotel, got a room reserved and then called a cab. The man at the desk refused to give us our money back, and insisted that the situation was ridiculous. I assured him that even having to have this conversation was, in fact, ridiculous and I was very disappointed in the service and accommodations.

We were *very* fortunate to read Tripadvisor reviews and hit upon this place when we were looking for something low-cost but still having some character. And character is what the Miami River Inn has in gobs! The staff, especially the young woman clerk, I think would've done almost anything for us. Even with a good map, experience city driving and a sense of direction, I could NOT find this place from its address. I had to have the woman clerk stay with me on the phone until I drove into the parking lot. Then I had to call back to find out where the office was! Our room was small, the bed was only a double but good, and the bathroom was big enough to have a party in. The yard is to die for: well-established landscaping, green everywhere, a turquoise pool that did not look tempting in January, and lots of comfy outdoor furniture for breakfast, reading and general hanging out. Breakfast was marvelous coffee, teas, fruit breads, apples, bananas and oranges, yogurt, toast and spreads, cold cereal, all with antique tableware. The poor clerk again had to lead us to the part where breakfast was - although there are maybe 8? houses in the compound, only 4 are the hotel and others are private residences - and she did so graciously and smilingly. Lounging outdoors comes equipped with cats, which made us feel less lonely for ours. Indoors, the furnishings are all antiques. Our shower did have duct tape around the bathtub faucet, which may have been the only flaw in the whole place. There is a decanter of wine that lives inside the lobby and to which guests may help themselves, although, being sober, we didn't. The whole place is surrounded by a tall iron fence overgrown with greenery, and the compound felt very safe due to heavy gates that guests and residents need to use a key to get both into and out of. Next door there is a small cafe and grocery store at the base of the NeoLofts apartments. They sell pastries, coffee, good sub sandwiches, so-so pizzas. The elderly gentleman who runs it is Italian, raised in Argentina, and a great storyteller. His grandsons bustle around taking care of the clientele, many of whom are shopping or eating from the seemingly luxury apartments overhead, sometimes with their dogs to visit with and pat. The ever-so-helpful desk clerk also gave us a printed list of area restaurants with descriptions of the food they offer, how informal or formal they are, and prices to eat there. She recommended a place we saw but did not try, which produces fairly good Chinese, Italian and Mexican (?), all at the same place, which can also deliver. The lobby also includes a variety of pamphlets about area attractions. All in all, despite not necessarily having exquisite physical comforts, the Miami River Inn is wonderful in its history and warmth, and the staff made us feel extraordinarly welcomed.

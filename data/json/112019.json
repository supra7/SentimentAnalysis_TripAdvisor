I would stay there again. Cons of the Chelsea Savoy: Thin blankets, it was cold at night. When we asked for extra blankets, they brough extra comforters, not actual thermal blankets. Hit and miss staff. We had a flight leaving at 6:00 pm, I called and asked the front desk if they could arrange a car to pick us up. The person I talked to was very unhelpful as far as what time the car should arrive (he kept asking me what time we wanted to leave and I told him I didn't know, that our flight was at 6:00, asked him what did he suggest). He was also very unclear on the cost of the car. He told me one thing over the phone, when we got back to the hotel to wait for the car, we asked to confirm the price again and he called the company.

The smell may come from the carpet. The other days we could still smell it but we tried to keep the windows opened during the day Pros: the room size is ok. It has a TV, small fridge, alarm clock with Ipod/iphone connection, small safe in the closet About the noise, we were in the last floor facing the street. We could hear some noise eventually during the night or early in the morning, but that did not prevent us from sleeping well. Bathroom Pros: the size is big, they have clean towels changed every day, hairdryer and amennities (shampoo, soap, etc) Cons: the shower is fixed too low in the wall. So if you are over 1.75m height you may have to flex your knees to fit under the shower and wash your hair for example. Location: For us the location was very convenient, since we used the subway as our main transport method during our stay and there is a subway station a few steps away. Also, there are a lot of places to eat nearby. We tried Highpoint (recommended), there is Starbucks, there is Whole Foods Market (amazing place to buy fruits, fresh juice and groceries) Breakfast The free breakfast is only coffee/tea and some bagels/muffins. We had breakfast there only once. There are so many nice delis to have breakfast in NY, that we chose to spend a few dollars and have a nice breakfast somewhere else (Bread Factory - next to Macy's is very nice, or go to a Magnolia Bakery (Rockfeller Center or Bleeker St) and start your day with a delicious and famous cupcake) Wifi Internet at the hotel is not free, you have to pay for it. Or go outside and use the wifi from the place you will have breakfast (many many places in NY have free wi-fi) Staff I had read some complaints about the staff but we didn't have any problem with them.

From the outside the hotel is rather nondiscript. Once we found the entrance, we entered a clean, well lit space with a small front desk and two elevators. Nothing fancy, but totally effecient.

If you are looking for a clear place to stay in a great location, then this is the hotel for you. The free continental breakfast was basic but a nice touch. Don't expect amenities like a business center, gym, day spa, etc. The location is great right above the 1,2,3 subway line and a block away from the A,C,E. We sayed in a king room for $155/night. The room was very clean and fairly well appointed. The room had a minifridge, desk, flatscreen TV, air conditioning and a standard bathroom with clean towels, shampoo and soap. There is daily maid service and the maintenance staff came up very quickly when are A/C stopped working. Overall this is a very solid hotel for New York City. The price is right and the location ideal for exploring the city.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cSpartan, well-located and well-priced\u201d", "Author": "BTfromSF", "ReviewID": "UR94416320", "Content": "This was the third time I've stayed at the Chelsea Savoy. I've grown addicted to its near-perfect location near 3 uptown/downtown subway routes (on 6th, 7th and 8th Avenues) and a crosstown bus route (on 23rd St.). On previous occasions, I became acquainted with the somewhat brusque attitude of the front desk staff mentioned by numerous other reviewers. This time seemed different, however. They were much more friendly and, for the first time, let me into my room well before the \"official\" 3 PM check-in time. The Chelsea Savoy's building looks of 60s vintage. That's a lot newer than many New York hotels. Yes, it could use a little TLC here and there, but it's basically in decent shape. The lobby is very small. There are no extra facilities like spas and workout rooms. They do provide \"Continental Breakfast\" in the lobby but I've actually never eaten it since I visit New York mostly to eat at its many restaurants outside my hotel. The CS's rooms are also fairly small (not cramped) but they all face the street (none in a light well that I've encountered) and seem to sport new flat panel TVs this year. Bed linens are inexpensive but serviceable and no evidence of bedbugs. Wireless internet is available but not free (I paid $35 for 5 days) In short, this is a great place if you are coming to New York to explore the town, not your hotel, and want a place mainly to change clothes, take rest breaks and sleep.

Also Wholefoods market and Jamba Juice is one block from the hotel. It is a relatively small hotel and I really liked it, the staff gave the feeling knowing you and they had a good luggage room system on the last day.

Very Clean. Great central location in NYC\u201d", "Author": "vibeuk", "ReviewID": "UR78400046", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights 5 days. The last time I came to NYC (2008) I stayed at the Pan American in Queens and absolutely hated it. So this time i was adamant to stay in the city on some kind of budget- at least. After a month of researching hotels in Manhattan, including reading various reviews on here, I stumbled across the Chelsea Savoy and decided to take the plunge and go for it. And boy, I have absolutely no regrets in doing so. Ok so first things first, if you are looking for luxury or is someone who is EXTREMELY picky about absolutely everything, then this hotel is not for you. Wait until you've won the lottery and stay at the Four Seasons. It's basic, but incredibly clean, especially the bathroom, which was surprisingly large. The cleaning staff here are particularly friendly so please tip them what you can. I took the 2 double beds room- as i was staying here with my dad. And i have to say, compared to many hard beds I slept in while travelling in Europe, these were quite soft and pleasant to sleep on. Basic TV in the room with HBO. Extras included an iron and ironing board and a mini fridge- Which was great considering it was 97F outside. The aircon in the room can be slightly noisey but you soon get use to it. And what's great about the air-conditioning system at this hotel is that it doesn't blow the air at you, but rather circles the air around the room and sets everything at room temperature. So if you suffer from a bad back or muscle problems, and a/cs in general usually makes things worse for you, then you don't need to worry about this one, it is very comfortable. Our room faced the back onto the court-yard and I would suggest you try and book the same, because the noise (from the street) in the front facing room I heard can be quite annoying. I'll concede that the staff are not exactly the most talkative and friendliest bunch, but they do their job and they do it fairly well in my opinion. Whenever we had a slight problem with something in the hotel, it was usually sorted out pretty quickly. The complimentary breakfast is basic by American standards, but for us Europeans it is more than perfectly adequate. They have Tetly tea there and coffee. But if its not enough for you, then there are plenty of cheap and cheerful cafes near by. There's a bar next door called Jake's Saloon... So if you fancy a beer you can just pop in there. In terms of food, you really need not worry. Vegetarian, kosher etc... They have it all within the little block this hotel is in. A little tip for those staying here, there is an organic food store literally across the street from where the number 1 subway is. They have a fresh hot buffet every day, rice with red kidney beans, roast potatoes, spicy chicken wings etc. And after 7.30 in the evening, the buffet is half price ($7.99 at other times). So we took our food from there most times and it was delicious. But if you fancy an Indian, there's one there thats less than a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Thai food on the block etc. I could not ask for a better location. We literally walked everywhere as everything was near us. Time Square and Madison Square Gardens were literally a 15- 20 minute walk straight up from the hotel. I mean you can't ask for better than that for Manhattan. So all in all I had a fantastic time here at this hotel. If you want a basic but clean hotel, thats near to everything you could possibly want to be near to in NYC, than really you wouldn't go wrong by booking this hotel. Although I really shouldn't be saying this because as soon as the word is out on this gem of a place, the prices will go through the roof! Damn it don't come...

We picked Chelsea Savoy b/c it was cheap and had no hits on the bed bug sites. We still packed a flashlight and brushed up on how to check a room for an infestation. When we checked in, we left our bags in the tub and took the room apart. We stripped the bed, down to the mattress (which was zipped into a protective bag - a good sign), the drawers, the interior of the closet, under the bed (we moved it, tipped it over, etc, etc). We examined every sheet and pillow and pillowcase. We looked behind pictures. Not only was the room bug-free, it was cleaner than my house. We found dust behind the bed, but every other surface was spotless. We remade the bed and slept there confident that the hotel was well-taken-care-of, and our room was bug free. My advice?

This is definitely a no frills hotel, but the room was clean and rather large for a NYC hotel - I requested two doubles since the rooms are usually bigger. What makes this hotel great is its proximity to the subway. You have access to 3 subway lines! Right around the corner of the hotel is the 1 train. One Ave west are the C/E lines and one Ave east are the F/V lines. While the hotel is not in midtown, its location was very central to all we visited since we only covered The Met and down. We were able to take the subway or walk back to the hotel to freshen up or to drop off shopping bags without any hassle or long commute. The service at the hotel was nothing special. Front desk people loved to chat amongst themselves and leave you standing there, but a loud sigh and a death stare usually snapped them out of it. The sheets and towels were a bit thin and the shower in the second room we had was VERY slow to drain.

The fruit cup was cheaper and more generous than Starbucks or Au Bon Pain. This place is a cute little gourmet grocery with caf\u00c3\u00a9 and pastry counter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c check it out. A few doors down from the hotel (23rd, towards 8th Ave) is a convenience store where you can grab water, sodas, tea, etc. I believe its open 24 hours.

The hotel is located in the Chelsea neighborhood right near the 23rd street subway station. It didn't have any amenities other than a bar next to the lobby where free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and breakfast pastries were available every morning. Internet access was available for a fee. The room was clean and had two double platform beds (watch out for those wooden corners!) a small TV in an armoire, a desk and chair, two nighstands, a clock radio, a telephone, and a closet. The en suite bathroom had a granite countertop around the sink, but the mirror was missing a small chunk near the bottom, there were some cracked floor tiles, and the lighting was a flourescent tube. The towels were standard white hotel issue, nothing fancy. The staff were friendly and helpful and service was great. The hotel felt safe, although two members of our group reported seeing a bleeding man slumped over in the 23rd St. subway station at 10:30pm on a Friday night (they alerted the station attendant to get the man some help). There were restaurants and shops within easy walking distance of the hotel. Our room was a corner room and had two windows. The upside of that was we had good views. The downside was that street noise was pronounced, i.e., it sounded like the windows were open even when they were not. Bring earplugs if you need it quiet when you sleep. The room had an individual heating/cooling unit, so you could control the temperature and fan speed. Soap, shampoo, lotion, a showercap, and mouthwash were provided in the bathroom. There was a soda vending machine in the bar, but no food vending machines. Free maps of the city were available in the lobby. The hotel will hold your bags if you arrive prior to check in time or depart well after you check out, so that was convenient and saved us having to lug our suitcases around the streets.

There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel (boston market, cuban resturant; ect) but I liked the mango/papaya spot that was diagonal across (23 & 7th).", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat\u201d", "Author": "IrelandDerek", "ReviewID": "UR16261397", "Content": "Stayed in the Chelsea Savoy and thought it was brilliant.

Speaking from my friend and my point of view we were more than happy with the hotel. Rooms are a good size as are bathrooms. Beds were very comfortable, good wardrobe space, plenty of hot water, tho shower pressure not too strong. My only quibble was that there were not too many power points, european visitors remember american adaptor. Rooms were cleaned daily. Hotel does not do b.fast but free v. good coffee, bagels and muffins in lobby from 8am, and plenty of delis and coffee shops in area. Contrary to other reviewers I found reception staff very friendly and helpful. Most are of Polish nationality and couldnt be nicer. To my horror I cracked a tooth on my first night, reception staff were super, located a dentist and Ava, one of staff, even offered to give me her appt. with her dentist!! All in all I would recommend the Chelsea Savoy/ Location is great, subway stop outside the door, great shopping on 16th, 17th sts between 5th and 8th avenue, esp. Loehmanns. Also on 6th Ave. and 23rd, 2 mins from hotel there is a superb organic wholefood market.!! Fab market selling cooked and raw food and products, we ate from there a lot.

I am happy to report our experience was really good. The room was #609. The hotel is not fancy at all, but it was clean and our room had space to spare with 2 double beds and one fold away bed we had asked for. The bathroom was a good size and had lots of counter space. The closet also was a good size and had a safe in it. The room did seem to have an odor of some kind....Like a new carpet smell...but we had no problems with it. Each morning we had newspapers outside our door and the coffee and pastry found in the lobby were nice to have when getting ready to face the day. The staff were friendly and efficient.

I stay in NYC almost every month so I know it can be hard to find a good hotel for that price and I wasn't expecting too much. I had read previous reviews talking about a strong smell but they were from June/July so I figured by August the smell would be gone! The room was basic and clean and actually quite spacious by NY standards. I think the ceilings are higher than normal too. No flat screen tv, just a regular one, but I don't come to NY to watch TV! The main problem was that the room smelled like it was freshly painted. It was STRONG! On top of that there were flies in the room (presumably because they had the window open to air it out but the screen had a hole in it so flies came in). I have almost no sense of smell so it didn't bother me that much, but my friend is very sensitive to things like that and kept having to go downstairs every hour or so to \"air out.\" We asked down at the desk and the woman there said it hadn't been painted recently. Later, after a shift change, we asked the guy at the desk and he said it HAD been painted. He said we could switch rooms the next night but would have to switch back for the night after that - not worth the hassle so we stayed put, left the window open (with a magazine covering the hole). What sucks is that the Chelsea Savoy could be an awesome hotel (instead of just average) with just a little more attention to detail. It's in a great location (just doors down from the famous Chelsea Hotel) and it's within walking distance of tons of restaurants. I would stay there again. It's a good value for the money (just watch out for the paint smell).

We usually stay in mid-town, but the prices of hotels in mid-town has increased quite a bit.

What we found the rooms were clean and roomy for NYC standards. The bathroom was larger than most hotels we have stayed in mid-town. The staff was friendly enough and they were always happy to store your luggage. There is a continential breakfast included with the room, but it looked rather sad so we only had some coffee. We had a great breakfast at the restaurant \"Cafeteria\" on 17th St. & 7th Ave. The location of the hotel is great, 23rd St. & 7th Ave. It is a safe & convenient neighborhood. There is the 1,2,3 subway lines right outside the hotel door or a block away at 8th Avenue is the A, C, E lines. Whether we were walking or taking the subway, it was easy to get around the city.

In the evenings, we just wanted to collapse in a decent room - and we really did choose an ideal place. Our room featured a king-sized bed (2 feather pillows on it, 2 foam pillows in the closet), small refrigerator (genius), tiny safe, iron/ironing board, TV and remote. Bathroom had little containers of shampoo/conditioner, body lotion, etc. - which surprised me. Bathroom also had a make-up mirror and an in-the-wall hairdryer - nice touches, reminiscent of a higher-priced hotel. Two things to note about the bathroom: the sound of the toilet flushing is VERY loud, and there are no facial tissues provided. Also, be aware that the water pressure in the shower is pretty weak, although the termperature is great. \"Continental breakfast\" is bagels/muffins/pastries in the lobby with pots of coffee - absolutely nothing fancy (for one thing, there are no tables or anything, so you bring stuff back to your room), but welcome nonetheless. The one ice machine in the hotel is also on the lobby floor. Front desk staff is helpful and courteous. There are no bellmen, per se, but we were asked if we needed help with our bags, so presumably someone could have helped us if we'd needed it. Housekeeping is efficient - we never saw them, but our room was spotless every night when we returned. The hotel is at 23rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue, right in the middle of Chelsea, and pretty close to midtown. Lots of interesting stores, decent restuarants, etc. nearby, and of course a cab ride can take you pretty much anywhere you want to go in New York. The best part of our Chelsea Savoy experience was that we only paid $203 per night - WITH tax! For that price, a very nice room indeed.

We decided to go back to the Chelsea Savoy Hotel to ask again if the reservations were there and they claimed that none were to be found under my name. So we decided to stay the night. The rooms are not a bargain for the price you pay. They are very casual and low-class for a New York City stay. A month later, after receiving my credit card statement, I had found that they charged another 224 dollars for a stay for the next night. When calling them, I found that we DID have reservations but for the next day, which we failed to cancel because they said that our reservations never existed. As a very disatisfied customer, I wanted to know if any compensations could be made. Monica, who claimed to be the manager, blamed the whole situation on us. After retelling my dilemma again and again, she finally said that Debbie (I guess the rightful manager) was to return on the 25th, she could perhaps make some arrangements.

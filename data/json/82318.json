The property, including the pool and area, were spotless, very clean, and had great tiles for flooriing and sidewalk areas. There was NO peeling paint, and the beds were sooooo comfortable. They were plush, the bedding was very clean and fine-lined, and each bed had 5 pillows!!. The breakfast was more than sufficient to hold one over to lunchtime, the rooms featured refrigerators, and we even were able to 'rent' a microwave from the office for just $5/day. (we had microwave popcorn we enjoyed at night.) :-) The hotel is in walking distance of lots of shopping areas, and many different types of restaurants. (We HIGHLY recommend the Sam's Philly Steak Depot nearby. Look up the address. It was plentiful, delicious, and very reasonably priced. The restaurant was very clean and decorated in the old-diner style.) This hotel is in a very safe area, too. If you are visiting the Greater Los Angeles area for any type event or trip, it is well worth your time and money to stay here.

We often transport antique furniture and the safety of an area is important to us because of the cargo we carry. The hotel is off of the freeway, located on a main street, and backs up to a residential area. The parking area is in the back of the hotel but the management was able to give us a corner room just next to the lot. We didn't bring our trailer on this trip, but the parking area is set up so that we could have driven through it with our small trailer (8')--although we would have needed to put it in it's own parking spot. The room was good sized with in-room coffee and a refrigerator and a copy of the LA Times was delivered to our door in the morning. We were able to use the free Wi-fi without any trouble. The continental breakfast started at 6:30am and included fruit, cereal, juice, milk, and baked goods--enough to get us started for the day. The property appeared well kept and the staff was very nice.

We were supposed to stay for 3, but we checked out one day early. I found the hotel online, and called to make my reservation. I was told that the rate was $99 and I would get a 10% discount for being AAA. When I got there, I was told that the rate was $109 and the AAA discount would bring it down to $99. I just checked the site again, and it is still showing up as the first rate. I was annoyed enough that when the chance came to leave a day early, I did. The room itself was nice. I must say though that it was TINY. We stayed at the St. George Inn last year, and the room was almost twice the size for less money. The amenities were nicer at the Tarzana Inn. You get more stations on the cable and the room was cleaner. If money is tight, I would recommend looking into the St. George Inn. If the difference of $10-20 isn't going to make or break your trip, and you don't mind a room the size of a micro-hotel room, then stay here. Next year when I go? I am not sure where I will stay.

It is a very clean, tidy, well maintained property, with a nice. BUT... A/C fan is very noisy, kept us up all night - needed though because the area is very HOT during the summer. Also, we asked for a crib, and they provided one, but it was not put together when we arrived and we put it together ourselves which was risky to our toddler (we didn't think to call the desk; they probably would have put it together for us). Also, in the middle of the night (4 AM) a neighboring alarm clock went off, an annoying buzzer, but the hotel was very responsive and entered the empty room and turned off the alarm within minutes. It was also disappointing that we had no bathtub in our bathroom in which to bathe our toddler, just a shower albeit with a convenient detachable shower head. Also, remember it is a motel. That means the clientele is a little on the creepy side - for instance, one guy was arguing with the desk clerk (who couldn't have been nicer) over $20 on the room rate - and then proceeded to pull out a wad of hundreds. Another guy was, shall we say, robustly tattooed with a particular hate group on his arms. (He also had keys to a Ferrari - and there was one parked in the lot....) But there were no problems during our one night sojourn there. All in all - if you need a motel in the area, it's exceptionally clean, and actually a little cute.

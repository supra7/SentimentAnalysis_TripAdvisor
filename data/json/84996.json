The room was very spacious, with a sitting area, wet bar, office space, and two beds that I thought were quite comfortable. One of my fellow travelers said that he found it too soft, but I enjoyed it. Bathroom and shower were about what one would expect. The decor is nice and modern, which for some reason makes it all seem cleaner. Breakfast was great! First time I've ever seen a pancake machine that makes pancakes for you on demand. Plus they had plenty of pastries, sausage, bacon, eggs, the whole nine yards. Even little omelets the 2nd day. The location is central to a lot of things, but the traffic on Kendall Dr is a nightmare, like most of Miami. We missed the turn (turn at the Red Lobster/McDonalds) and ended up having to drive 1.3 miles around the block to get back.

The only negative comment is the hotel is on the east of miami which is a few miles from south beach and downtown miami,but the bus stops outside the hotel and will take you to the dade shopping mall/metro station.for $2 a person.once there you can purchase a day,s pass for $5 which will allow you to use the mono-rail and bus service to vist down town miami ,south beach and other shopping malls,superb value.you can also use it to get to miami airport if you wish.the weather was great .make sure you visit the everglades and zoo.if you use taxi,s like us to and from the airport expect to pay about $50 each way so use public transport where you can. so although a bit off the main area the hotel more than makes up for it,s position and we found it safe to walk out at night the half mile or so to the restaurants.the traffic is busy but the lights allow you to cross in safety.if we come back to miami this will be our first choice without exception", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "act1013", "Title": "\u201cAlways a Clean & Comfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "act1013", "ReviewID": "UR121303801", "Content": "Stay at this hotel for weekend getaways to Miami.

Breakfast was very good with the largest and best selection I have ever seen at a Holiday Inn Express. We had scrambled eggs or cheese omlettes with biscuits and susages on different mornings. Pancakes available every day. The hotel is behind Red Lobster and McDonald's restaurants. Close to other restaurants and about 5 minutes driving from Dadeland Mall. Service was good.

I chose HI Ex. again since my previous experience at HI Express in Los Angeles had been so great..and I must say I was not disappointed at all!!!.. The hotel is around 20-30 minutes from the International airport. The check-in/check-out were pretty quick, the room just perfect with two comfortable queen beds, a living room and a small kitchenette with mini fridge, microwave, coffee machine + daily supply of coffee. The staff was really friendly and always willing to help (some spoke Spanish).. The Hotel is very well located close to the 88th SW street, and being so close to that avenue, we did not hear any traffic noise during all our stay, so it was really quite inside and we could get a great sleep!.. If you are on a budget but do not want to sacrifice quality, this is the hotel for you. The complimentary breakfast is good enough for a quick start (good coffee, scramble and boiled eggs, bagels, juice, milk, yogurt, etc.) and you can have the USA Today delivered daily into your room, or simply available at the lobby. You can also count on a \"coffee station\" at the lobby with fresh coffee all day long, even coffee to go! If you do not like driving outside your country, like I do, there is stop bus just a few steps from the hotel. By taking bus Nr. 88 you can get directly to the Dadeland Mall or to the Dadeland North Station to take the metrol rail which will take you to the northern side of Miami (same bus for the trip back). We took this bus daily and we could get to the Village of Merrick Park, Bayside Market Place, and even the Sea Aquarium by simply combining with the metro rail and metromover. Next to the hotel you have a Mc Donald's and if you like seafood, there is a Red Lobster just next to the hotel too. I think there are some other restaurants nearby but we did not tried them since we always eat at the malls!!.. There is also a big shopping center across the street next to the Toys R us store, with a Subway, Burger King, a CVS pharmacy, a Marshall store, Kohl's, among others. Overall, I think the hotel is simply excellent! friendly staff, clean, quiet, well located, good breakfast, good free high speed internet.

We were advised before we went that the hotel was undergoing a soft renovation and that was fine. I was hoping that we got one of the rooms that had just been painted and got new carpet. Alas, we did not not. Our room was what I would expect for the money we paid. I never really felt like the room was cleaned as well as it should have been and we quickly discovered ants all over the suite, especially in the kitchen. Even though we had a kitchenette, I never felt comfortable leaving food in the fridge or cooking because of the ant situation. They were really small ants that you couldn't barely notice unless you looked very closely, but they were there. 1 hour after getting there, our traveling companions realize that their TV in their room had a green picture and they couldn't adjust it. The old Zenith TV just wasn't cutting it. She called to the front desk to ask for a replacement. 5 days later at checkout, we had never received a replacement TV. I also called and asked about the laundry facility and asked if there was a cost and was told no on the phone, but when I get down to the office, I realize that it was a coin laundry and they charged for the washer/dryers and the soap. I'm fine with paying, but just let me know if it costs money so I don't have to trek all the way back to my room for quarters. Also, it was sporadic when the breakfast would be out. They said it was available from 6-9, but often I went down to the office area at 8am and it wasn't out. Instead, they would ask you what you wanted and then go retrieve it. It seemed to be a total inconvenience and lazy on the staff's part. There were other snafu's, but I do have to say that the beds were comfortable, we received fresh towels everyday and the housecleaning did an okay job of wiping things down.

The cost is $5.00 and it ia an all day expirence getting on on off the water taxi as much as you like throughout the day. We boarded at Shooter's which was a nice restaurant with a nice outside deck to enjoy the breeze from the water while having your meal. Aslo there is a 1 day cruise by Discovery Cruises but you can stay up to 3 nights to the Bahamas that leaves from Port Everglades which is right by Laurderdale Airport. The cost is $149.00 per person but if it is your birthday you go free and I also recommend the $20 upgrade for the 7 course meal at dinner. I would recommend the Towneplace suites to anyone who likes the quiet life and wants to cook in or out at the property. The kitchen if fully equiped with a stove, fridge, microwave, dishwaher and pots & pans. There is a grocery store close by to obtain those must haves in the room.", "Date": "July 31, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "TownePlace Suites Miami Lakes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d87122-Reviews-TownePlace_Suites_Miami_Lakes-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$89 - $138*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8079 NW 154 Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33016</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87122", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/a5/f0a516dc52b30d9019a912662b41970f7large.jpg"}}

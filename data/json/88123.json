I came to this hotel with my 3 children. I have been here in the past and have had no problems with the accommodations. We stayed right after Christmas time and the rates were jacked up to where it was unbelievable, it cost over $140.00 to stay at a hotel with no ash tray in the smoking room, a broken ice machine, dirty linens, a broken toilet, no internet access, and no phone for the room for 2 nights. When I needed towels I was told by the manager to get the towels myself. After this I reported the hotel to the national chain and I was told by an \"internet specialist\" that the manager of the hotel would be in contact with me within 2 weeks. Here is the exact transcript of the email: Dear Customer, Thank you for taking the time to bring your concern to our attention and allowing us the opportunity to address your needs. We are sincerely sorry to hear we did not provide you with an excellent Knights Inn experience. You can count on our team to help resolve your concerns. To assist you in reaching a resolution, I've informed the Knights Inn Orlando East's general manager of the situation. The general manager will contact you by 1/25. As a company, we're committed to delivering a great experience every time you stay with us, and I sincerely apologize this did not happen in this case. Please know that we truly appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to respond to your concerns. I replied: I appreciate your effort to give each of your guests a pleasant experience at the Knights Inn, but feel very uncomfortable speaking to the man who rented me the room & do not wish to have any confrontation, as the gentleman was polite, but clearly didn't have the resources to carry the Knights Inn name. In the future, I will research reviews. I tend to trust chain hotel/motels. I've never stayed in a chain motel in this disarray. It would be best practices if Knights Inn administration dealt w/ their own managers and staff. I am a guest and do not feel it is my place to get involved via telephone w/ the motel mgr and want no hard feelings. I know that the economy is in shambles, I only expected that a brand name motel have a minimal/moderate standards. Thank you for your prompt response & the best of luck w/ cleaning up the Kissimmee Knights Inn for tourists to stay. It was clearly a residential motel and Not suitable for a family visiting Disney. I hope this helps. Reply from a different \"internet specialist\": I am so sorry to hear about what you have encountered with the hotel, but we must allow the hotel the business days to resolve this with you. Please allow the manager until 1/24/12 to resolve the issue. I will watch your case and if you have not been contacted by 1/24/12, we will contact you. So after a ridiculous game of back and forth, the hotel chain insists that I have a confrontation with the manager! Why would I want to speak with the manager after this stay? He knows how I was treated, he treated me this way, and why would I want to stay at this hotel again? I'm more disgusted with the way that the Knights Inn hotel chain reacted to the situation than even the disgusting hotel itself. I will never stay at any Knights Inn chain motel again.

However, each review about this Motel hit it right on the head. This place is horrible, scary and should be reported and condemned. I like to give the benefit of the doubt for the bad reviews but there is no way around the bad quality of these accommodations. We planned to come down to Orlando for a short get-away trip and needed some casual lodging for 3 days. When we arrived at 2:00 a.m. we had a easy check in and even the service was nice but upon stepping into our room it was like stepping into something like a third world country. The walls were smeared with black dirt or smudge. The floors smelled of mold and dust. The bedspreads on the double beds were dirty and old. The furniture looked old and broken. The bathroom smelled because of poop still left in the toilet and mold in the shower. We didn't even request anything we immediately booked another room at a Howard Johnson down the road. We weren't even there 20 mins, even with the hotel trying to show us 4 other rooms. We were gone. This room was actually scary, something out of a horror film and that isn't an exaggeration. Please, Please reconsider any decision to stay here. There are plenty of other motels on Irlo Bronson at the same or similar price that are more acceptable accommodations. I didn't even care that I didn't even get my money back.

An electrical outlet was just left open and busted at the back of the TV and rusted fridge for an additional $3, a disconnected telephone and rusted hangers plus a yellowish toilet bowl full of floating dead bugs. We stayed for that night when the manager/owner of Indian descent convinced us to move to what he said \"much better newer room\".

The receptionist told us that our room was ready and sent us on our way. We walked up to the room and the door was wide open. The mattresses were off of the beds and the sheets were laying on the floor. In the sink we found lots of vomit. We went back to the front desk and told the receptionist. After giving the hotel more than an hour to clean our room we went back and it was still a mess. The floor was not vacuumed, there was a whole in the bottom of the door, the sink still had vomit in it, and the bedsheets had not been changed. (I flipped them back and found hair and bodily fluids on them.) Lets just say that as soon as I saw this, we packed up our things and went to a different hotel. The hotel grounds are a mess. It looks as if people are living long-term in the hotel. The pool is disgusting and looked as if it was not cleaned within months. The hotel staff is rude and does not care about its guests.

We took two adjoining rooms here during our stay in Orlando in August 2004. Was this hotel great? No, the room was clean but was sparsely furnished, the beds were passable and the service was eh... However, for the amount spent I have trouble complaining. The hotel is 10 minutes for Disney and the parking spot right outside the room is a huge time saver. Yes the breakfast was simple, but it's breakfast and a simpler meal means a shorter meal which means earlier arrival at the park (which avoids tons of lines). While we stayed at this motel Hurricane Charley struck. This hurricane knocked the power out of one of the rooms and not the other which was strange but the building held up and we were at SeaWorld the next day! If you believe your trip to Orlando is about riding rides and enjoying the attractions this hotel is not a bad choice, easy to get in, easy to get out. If you don't subscribe to the all hotels look the same when the lights are off theory and are picky about your accommodations, you may want to look elsewhere.

I booked a reservation at Knights Inn Maingate East in Kissimmee. When I got there, it was not at all what I expected. The conditions at the hotel were totally unacceptable. Upon checking in, my reservation was booked for a smoking room when in fact, I booked it for a non-smoking. The clerk then proceeded to book me in a another room. Upon entering the room, the floor was sinking, exposing a hole along the wall where the floor was suppossed to connect to the wall. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the carpeting was filthy and it also was water soaked possibly due to a bathroom leak. This caused a moldy odor in the room. Also, the bed sheets were stained and the air conditioning unit was totally falling apart. As tired as I was, I decided to spend the night and try to make the best of the situation. The following morning, I left bright and early to attend one of the theme parks. Upon returning later that evening, I noticed that the sheets had been changed once again with stained linens. And this time there was a very strong odor of what seemed like cat urine that overcame the entire room. The odor was so strong that It made me sick to my stomache. I finally went to the front desk and told them about the entire situation. The clerk told me that the only thing he could do would be to book me in a smoking room. I decided that I could not possibly spent the rest of my vacation in this place. And so, that evening at approximately 2:00 AM, I checked out of the Knights Inn and set out to find a hotel with acceptable accomodations.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Idaho Falls", "Title": "\u201cYuck!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5359206", "Content": "The floors were coming apart, the room stunk, there was water damage, the ceiling was seperating from the wall, the tub was backed up, the toilet leaked, the pool was dirty, and there was snot stuck to the wall.

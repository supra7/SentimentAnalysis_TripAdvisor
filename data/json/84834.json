The hotel is a bit older, but the rooms were clean, and a nice size and the room also had a fridge which was really handy. The pool area is amazing, the tropical flowers and landscaping are beautiful. There are a couple of pools, the one pool is heated, and then there is one with the waterfalls and waterslide, which is really fun, and there is also a little kiddies pool as well. There is lots to do for the kids, a games room and basket ball net, ping pong, outdoor chess board and also the pool that has the water slide there were activities there everyday, hula hoop contests, poolside bingo etc. also some days they have free ice cream at the pool which was a nice treat, and also in the evening in the lobby they had movies for the kids. The poolside bar was good , but was a little pricey, like one of the other reviewers mentioned a frozen daquiri is 11.50, and the 18% tip is included in your total. The food was good at the poolside bar and reasonably priced. In the main lobby of the hotel there is also a starbucks and deli, which had breakfast items as well as lunch, and there is also a pizza hut, and there is a gift shop. The hotel also has a restaurant. Close by there is a little plaza you can walk to which has a gift shop, a couple of restaurants and a grocery store, also within about a 5min drive there is a Publix grocery store with good selection. The staff at this hotel were great, very helpful and attentive. I had problems with the printer in the computer room and the lady there was very helpful and printed up what I needed. I also had to call down and ask to have someone fix our room safe and they sent someone up within 5 minutes and the called shortly after to be sure everthing was fixed. When we first arrived, we checked in early, which was quick and easy and they had a room available right away, someone called up within 10 minutes of being in the room to be sure we were happy with everything in the room.

I was concerned after reading the reviews. Here is what I found to be true. The pool is amazing! We spent an afternoon lounging after a busy day at the parks. There are activities for the kids and good places to get food and drinks. Very relaxing. We stayed in building 5000- this must have been a renovated building because the halls/carpet were clean and nice- so was the room. My only complaint for the room are the beds, they were hard as a rock. The people that work there were also very nice. This hotel is in an excellent location if you are going to Disney, it's right at the entrance. As far as the negative, my problem was with housekeeping. They were pretty slack while we were there- they didn't replenish the toilet paper, cups, stuff like that- they even missed a day completely. We were pretty upset when we got back to the room at midnight to find they hadn't come at all. We were out of toilet paper, kleenex, clean towels, soap and cups. When we called they told us they were sorry and someone from housekeeping would be up when they got back from their break. The next day while my kids were down for a nap I guess they were doing some work on the hotel and started drilling on the wall next to our room. This scared my kids to death! I asked them if they could please stop, which they did- but it would have been nice for them to call to let us know they were going to be doing this. I don't think we would be back as I plan to stay on Disney property next time to take advantage of extended hours.

Many sites have this listed as a 3.5 star resort, I would strongly disagree. The main issue we had with the hotel is that the room smelled musky and moldy. The first thing my 8 year old said when we opened the door was 'what's that smell?'. A moldy smell in the room is unacceptable -period, let alone for a resort. When I told the staff at the front desk about this, she said she would have housekeeping look at it and I said I'm sure that they have already smelled it- its not like it was a new smell and was impossible to miss. Additionally, the shower pressure was terrible and the sink/shower drains were both clogged leading to rising water in both. Again, this is unacceptable for this standard. I would be unable to recommend this hotel based on the issues noted, primarily the smell.

This hotel isn't really \"classy\" if you are accustomed to 5-star accommodations. We stayed there because our friends had an event planned on the compound. Kids should have no complaints staying there as the pool area is quite kid friendly with daily games like bingo, ping pong, portable putting greens, mini-basketball and foos ball around the pool. The games change daily which is a smart call by management and keeps things interesting for the children day to day. Because of the vast campus size, it can be cumbersome to walk if you are visiting friends in other buildings, but I suppose a bit of exercise never hurts, right? We were in bldg 6000 and we found it to be a nice location, but it is at the end of the complex, but close to the pool. Our room was pretty clean all in all. Water in the shower worked well. Kid size toilet in the small / cramped bathroom could disappear should a very large adult should attempt to use it. Television is a newer LCD or LED (whatever), and would be a much better use of space had it been wall mounted. The Wi-Fi internet was slow at times to log-on, but not slow enough to warrant a complaint. What DOES warrant a complaint is the card key system this Radisson Resort uses. In the many number of hotels we have stayed at, never has a \"too close\" cell phone erased the coding. I for one did not even think this was possible, but I had already lost a bet thinking a magnet in my wallet would not erase my room code. It did also, and it cost me a $6 draft beer at the pool to pay up. We had to have six key cards re-coded in three days time. I was told they offer no \"smoking permitted\" rooms. No problem for us because we don't smoke. But all of the people we visited smoked up a storm in their rooms anyhow. Something I would have definitely complained about had we checked in behind them, so apparently there is no penalty for stinking up a room with cigarette smoke. If you plan to stay here at the Radisson, or at many other Orlando/Kissimmee resorts ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BILLS PRIOR TO PAYING as they will add 18% gratuity without pointing it out. Typical Americans will add additional tips simply because they feel guilty putting a zero in the tip line before signing the check. I take pride in the zero (LoL). The check-in staff was kind, courteous, and efficient and spoke perfect English. Very few of the housekeeping staff we tried to speak to spoke English (if any). It's not unique to Radisson, but it is sad with the current unemployment rate for Americans being around 10% or more. In house breakfast was about $10+ and was not so good but it's better than the Waffle House up the street. All in all, this Radisson is about a 3-star hotel on a 3-star budget price. Great for a family stay. Probably not the best choice for a quiet romantic getaway because of all the kids on vacation being kids on vacation. Within walking distance.... not allot. A small grocery store with good beer prices. Foods and amenities are about 30% over Wal-mart retail, but worth the extra money for the convenience factor. For any camera supplies, the Digital Plus store is not recommended as a $10 item will cost about $89 so beware. Charlie's steak house is also in the plaza out front. Famous around Florida for having prime meats, but we did not have time to check the prices. About 5 miles to a Wal-mart.

When you vacation in Central Florida how much time will you actually spend in your room? Ours was spotless clean ( this to me is way more important than decor) , the carpet was not dirty like so many people complain about.No musty smell, the room had a pleasant smell of cleanliness to it. Our AC unit was a little bit loud, but that actually helped silence the noise from the hallway, so it didn't bother us at all. We stayed in building 3000, right next to the parking lot. It was a very comfortable room , with very nice and comfy beds. Housekeeping did an amazing job! I am sorry for not knowing the name of the person in charge of our room, but she was really wonderful. ( Management, kudos to housekeeping for room 2307) The grounds of the resort are very well kept. Pools are great. All of the staff is pleasant and helpful. I am really sorry we didn't have time yet to experience the Tiki Bar, it gets such great reviews. Honestly, if you expect a 5* hotel , then pay for one. This is not the Ritz Carlton.I think the people who put such bad reviews here were not realistic in terms of their expectations. This hotel is great! I just wish they had microwaves in the rooms too.

Only 10 mins from Seaworld and Universal. The daily 'resort' fee is a joke - I didn't use any of the facilities as all I wanted to do was stay away from this place. In fact, I'd prepaid for 5 nights but could only bear 4 but frankly nothing could have made me stay another night. No offer of compensation was offered however for the lost night, when I listed the reasons I wanted to leave. Having read the previous reviews, I gave the Radisson the benefit of the doubt being a Club Carlson member, and having some fantastic previous stays around the world. I noted however the comments on the damp smell in the lower floors, so I emailed ahead of my visit to request a high floor. I was assured on the email that this would be no problem. However, on arrival I was given a second floor room which sure enough stank of damp. It was hideous. There was a leak in the laundry room near our bedroom, but instead of someone actually mopping up the spill, a very loud dehumidifier was being used for 2 days. The room was dark and dingy, and again, did not have the most pleasant smell. The bathroom was filthy, long black hairs all over the floor and shower, and rubbish left in a corner of the room all week. There was a smiley face on the mirror from the previous occupants the whole time we were there, so that was obviously never cleaned. I'm just glad I took my own slippers as the carpet was gross. The hotel info book was filthy and falling apart. We had a connecting door to the next room which I hate as the noise tends to be worse from neighbours and sure enough we were woken by their TV. When this was still going on at 1am I called reception asking for their intervention as I had been banging on the wall with no luck, and to get a different room for the next day with no interconnecting door. They promised to call the room to speak to them but no other rooms were available at all. The noise didn't stop, so we drowned it out with the ridiculously loud air con, so we finally got some sleep. The next night, the tv was on ALL night - I later found out this room was for a baby, and the tv was comforting it. Not very comforting for me! No follow up was given to ensure I was satisfied. I had paid for the breakfast but lived only on cereal as the rest was less than appeitising. I didn't use any of the other facilities, eating out each night was much more preferable than spending any time here. This place needs a serious upgrade for the rooms - or even just a decent deep clean! Not one person asked during my stay if I was satisfied. Only plus points - location, free wifi and free parking.

There is also a game room and exercise room so plenty of things to enjoy while you're here. It's also close to the Disney attractions which is nice. I stayed in building 6000 so can't speak of the other buildings but this one if definately due for an update! The halls are dreadfully outdated with primary color scheme and the room was very much outdated. The sleep number bed was nice but I read not every room has one. Did appreciate the staff calling once we got to the room to make sure all was ok, but what can you really say? Glad I didn't pay full price to stay here. Also know they do charge a resort fee of $11.00+tax per night once you check in but at least parking is free and so is Internet access! I didn't see any problem with the area this was in at all and felt perfectly safe. Had in room safes too for small valuables.

TV was fine but the remote control sensor was not working or the remote needed new batteries. Room has a mini refrigerator with a complimentary bottle of water. Glasses, coffee cups, coffee maker. Beds were Ok. No bed bugs and sheets were clean. The best thing was the free wireless internet. No problems and very fast connection.

They provide free shuttle service to Epcot (from there you can transfer to the other parks) and departs at several times per day. We didn't use it, but that's a plus for a hotel.

When driving up to this hotel, the view looks great! It looks really good from the road. That's where \"pleasant\" ends and \"unpleasant\" begins. The experience started with rude staff at check-in. It's as if everyone hates working there. So now we are done with the front desk, let's drive around to our room. The hotel itself is large so the parking lot is also large, which is good, but it has a dark, dirty, unsafe feel, which is not so good. You park and start wheeling your luggage through the duck and goose poop. It is EVERYWHERE on the sidewalk. But, no big deal, it will be great inside. There were reviews from people who LOVED this place. The moment you walk inside the hotel, you see damage. There is damage everywhere: on the walls, the doors, inside the elevator. Next comes the smell. Some smells are pleasant. This one is not. You say to yourself, \"I hope it's better in my room\". Wrong, the smell does not lessen in your room. The smell is difficult to describe, but is similar to a combination of Oldness (if that term makes any sense), BO and mold, and it is omnipresent. The smell is a perfect compliment to the condition of the room: filthy. It was probably clean in 1983, but it is definitely not clean now...especially the floor. The much celebrated plush bed has a decorative, gold-colored sash. I call it a sash because I have no idea what it really is and a sash is useless decoration, which describes this thing...but not completely. In addition to the gold color, there is a red stain (blood?) on this thing. Did housekeeping really put this on the bed and not see a big red stain? This place is unbelievably bad. It is so dirty and smelly that you want to sleep standing up, with your shoes on. I get the creeps even thinking about that place. This is the worst hotel at which I have ever stayed. I have traveled extensively and have stayed in many hotels and this place has become our measure of sub-mediocrity since.

After a nightmare journey from Sanford Intl, which was more down to my map reading skills than anything else, we arrived at the Radisson at 2230. Check in was very smooth and was completed by a very friendly girl who was ecstatic at seeing the shuttle launch earlier that day. She was incredibly happy and upbeat, despite sporting some of the reddest sunburn i have EVER seen. We stayed in room 1204 which overlooked the pool area. The room contained two large beds, a decent sized bathroom and enough storage to put cases and clothing etc. Upon arrival there was not enough pillows so we called housekeeping who arrived withing minutes with pillows and extra towels etc. This speedy and efficient service was evident throughout our stay and the staff whom we had contact with were always pleasant and eager to please. The pool area is very pleasant, although at times can get very crowded. This is expected though when holidaying in the high season. We found breakfast in Mandolins slightly overpriced for a buffet, but this isnt really a moan. We chose to eat at the IHOP further down the 192 and the pancakes and bacon kept us going well into the afternoon at the themeparks. The hotel is well placed for Disney and is only a 10 minute drive at most. Universal is a little further, however, a quick journey on the I4 and you are there in no time at all. I particularly liked the closeness to Old Town which is one of my Orlando faves. Celebration, the Disney built village over the road, is also worth visiting. If only for wishing you could afford to live there yourself. I genuinely would find it hard to moan about our holiday at the Radisson as we all had 10 nights of pure Orlando sun and fun. If i had to find one thing, i was slightly disappointed to have to pay the $12 per day resort fee and to get very little in return. I appreciate that it includes the shuttle service, but the route and times are not the most conveinient and many people drive to the theme parks. The times also do not give the opportunity to stay on at Universal in the evenings and make the most of City Walk and its entertainment. This, however, is only a small down. Lastly i would give a warning re the cheap tickets offered by guest services. This is run by Vacation Village, and so i am NOT casting a moan towards Radisson OR the hotel. You are offered discounted tickets to Disney and / or Universal in return for taking 2 hours on a Timeshare tour. Well 2 hours eventually turned into FIVE hours. Despite the fact that we did receive a very lovely free breakfast and met Lance who is the most hysterical Disney creation himself, i would not recommend doing this. We ended up saving a few $$ but im sure you could do deals elsewhere without the timeshare shenanigans. All in all though we had a truly fab time at the hotel and would definately return.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland/Florida", "Title": "\u201cVERY DARK AND SCARY!\u201d", "Author": "love2gals", "ReviewID": "UR117623406", "Content": "This place is terrible!!

The Pool was great for kids as again like so many we picked this hotel because of the pool, but agree with other reviews that the pool could do with a clean. They had a big scren in the reception area every night had films for kids, there is a wifi room adjacent to this where you can surf while your children watch the film. The games room was okay - every day someone kept jamming a coin in the 25c thus you end up putting a dollar in to get tokens. The entertainment at the pool was basic and most of the kids tended to stay in the pool and wait until it was time to dive for tokens. We also booked a room with the sleep easy beds as previous reviews said they were great, we obviously missed something as the beds were uncomfortable and spent most of our time trying to adjust the bed before sleep, if one of moved or got out of bed the bed became uneven.

We Chose this resort based on the pool. The pool was ok and good for kids. There is a fun waterslide and a waterfall as well as some nice landscaping, but the pool area was very dirty. The concrete was in desperate need of a good scrub down or power wash. Also there was a smell, we kept getting wafts of what smelled like mouse/rat urine. The pool bathrooms were filthy; besides having way too slick tiles for an area that is constantly wet due to dripping swimmers, the grout was black and disgusting with mildew. The pool bathroom was not well constructed for its use by a pool. Our first day by the pool, there was a lifeguard/pool attendant who was not usually visible. Kids (and adults) were doing dangerous things off the watersllide that could have seriously injured someone, and there was no one around to monitor this. Our 2nd day however, a lifeguard was stationed at the top of the slide. Other concrete walkways to the hotel were also fairly dirty. Painting the walkways brown does not exempt you from cleaning them. A power washer would probably do this property wonders. Our room was comfortable, the bedding was clean, the AC worked well and the beds were comfortable. The room was not as clean though as it could have been. The grout in the bathtub was mildewed, not badly, but this just isn't something guests like to see in a hotel bathroom that is presumably cleaned frequently. The furniture seemed clean but worn and a little bit dated. Also, our wifi, what was supposed to be covered in the resort fee, did not work. We were told the router that was supposed to have been in our room seemed to be missing. we could occasionally get a signal, and fortunately I could conduct most of the business I needed to, but other times we wanted to make reservations or get directions, we were unable to. The rooms were very very noisy. Thankfully most of the guests were fairly quiet, but we could lay in our room and be woken the softest of noises in the hall, like someone opening a soda can or someone's flip flops. The one very positive thing I can say about this hotel, is every staff member we encountered, was wonderful.

The hassle free check in by courteous front desk staff was marred only by having to wait an hour beyond the published 4:00pm check in time. Check out was problem free. The room was clean, though the bathroom had a bit of a mildewy smell. To call the bed \"firm\" would be a huge understatement. In fact, it may have just been the hardest bed I've ever slept on. The A/C unit was pretty loud, but in fairness, that's pretty typical of hotel rooms. The TV looked like something from the 80's with limited channels and fuzzy picture. Not a big deal unless you spend a lot of time in the room. I guess I've been spoiled by recent stays in more updated hotels with newer flat screen TV's. My only real complaint was that the WIFI internet connection was down for most of the second day and night of my stay. When I called guest services, the woman kept offering to send someone to the room, even though she said they were experiencing problems with the internet... so sending someone to the room would have accomplished nothing. Other than that, she had no idea what the problem was or when it would be fixed. Not that big a deal... but it added a small irritant to the stay. Parking was ample. This is a high volume property that appears to cater to middle class guests... there is of course, nothing wrong with that at all but the property really shows its age and it doesn't seem much attention is given to appearance. The wood floors in the lobby are scarred and dull, the carpet in the hallways (and room) is in need of cleaning, the elevators are dirty with fraying carpet, etc. Overall, I was not dissatisfied with my stay, largely in party due to the modest $69 per night I paid.

I am sad to say that the shuttle service was extremely disappointing given the fact that it is included in the $12.50 per night resort fee. The hotel shares its shuttle with the Days Inn and the Howard Johnson, both pretty cheap hotels, which causes them to fill up fast. My mom had called the night before we checked in to see if we had to place reservations for the shuttle, but we were assured by the woman on the phone that they NEVER fill up so that is not necessary. Boy was that wrong. The Universal shuttle was fine the first day, but it only had one departure time and one pick-up time, which was frustrating because it greatly limited our options. The Disney shuttle could BARELY fit everyone on the way there both mornings, and would only drop off at Epcot, so we had to take a monorail and a bus to get to the parks we wanted to go to every day. The worst part was that they provide 5 shuttles TO the Disney parks and only 3 shuttles BACK. When we tried to get on the 8:45 shuttle there were twice as many people waiting at the stop as there were available seats causing all-out chaos when the bus pulled up. Elbows were thrown, kids were pushed around, families were separated, and about 25 people were left to wait another hour to be take back to their hotels. We asked the driver of the shuttle if this was a regular occurrence and he told us there had been a fist fight the week before and he had also had objects thrown at him in the past by angry patrons. When we got back to the Radisson, we asked to speak to a manager to inform her of what had happened. We didn't expect a change to be made during the last day we were there, of course, but we wanted to encourage them to change this for future guests because it felt genuinely UNSAFE. We didn't feel like our comments were heard and we got a free breakfast card that could only be used after 7AM at the sit-down restaurant, which we didn't have time to use because we were out of the hotel every morning by 7:15 in order to wait for the shuttle which might not have enough space for us if we showed up last minute. Oh, the irony. As far as the rest of the hotel, it was great. If you are not planning on going to the parks, I would recommend the hotel.

That really should have been our first clue. We trudged along, trying to ignore the mini roach hotel and graveyard section we'd just seen and checked into the hotel, where the staff was moderately friendly. We were charged a resort fee on top of our hotel fee, so that is something to keep in mind if you decide to try to brave what is presently known as the worst hotel I have ever seen. Once given our key cards, we made our way through the maze of hallways, greeted by broken doors hanging half off their hinges, filthy dirty carpet that obviously had not been vacuumed in months, cracked and broken light fixtures and carpet completely ripped up in sections as long as approximately 5x8 pieces. Our room was no better. Upon opening the door, we were greeted by a broken sleep number bed, more filthy carpet, permanently yellowed bedding, cracked fixtures and a generous layer of dust. We were so mortified we called the front desk and asked for a change of room, were informed they were all to this standard, but were nonetheless immediately shifted to another building. Room two was no better, minus the fact that the sleep number bed did work in this room. The entire space just felt disgusting, and neither of us would even sit in the chairs, let alone lay in the bed.

The carpets in the elevator, hallways, rooms are disgusting. Stains are everywhere! It smelled musty but I expected that in a humid climate. After unpacking we noticed that our safe did not work. After calling the front desk and a repairman coming up it was determined that we would have to switch rooms to get a safe that worked (we really use a safe since most of our purchases are with cash on vacation). After speaking with the front desk (not helpful) the manager got on the telephone and said that he would remove the resort fee for our trouble and explained that we could not move rooms since the hotel was full. I appreciated his honesty and decided that we would make do by locking our money in our car. The shuttles to the parks were only to EPCOT and were early in the morning with pickup later in the evening (Nothing in between). We have small children and we could not take the chance of having to stay at the parks until 7:00-8:00 p.m. if one of them didn't feel well or someone got tired. I thought that the shuttles were not at all convenient and we never used them. We swam in the pool a couple of times and found plastic, wrappers, etc... floating. It could have been from that day but it just did not feel clean. The waterfalls and fountains are very nice and the kids loved them as they loved the slide. Bottom of the pool is peeling. I had a massage by the pool and it was very nice. The price was in line with massages here at home so I thought that they did not try to gouge visitors.

DTD is about 8 miles away an the only time the shuttle will take you there is at 6 in the evening. I canceled immediately an said we would only be staying one night since we arrived at midnight.

Nice hotel beautiful ambiance and landscaping. Let's start. I stood here with my son for five days. It was nice to get a hot meal and kids dont pay. The only problem the meal wasnt hot. It was buffet style and always cold. Thank god the coffee was good. If you include the breakfast meal in the price of the hotel, it would be so much better. When I stay at a hotel I prefer the breakfast be included this way its something less I have to worry about. If you pay for breakfast, more people will eat there that means they will continue to have to refill the bins which means the food will be HOT! It just makes more sense. There were kids teams staying there. I believe softball and volleyball. They were loud and obnoxious at night. They were very discourteous about whom else was staying there. It was ridiculous how loud they were. The slide at pool is a great feature. My son loved it! For two out of three days we were there, they were servicing it or something cause it was not able to be used. I broke up the times my son and I would go to the pool because I really didnt want him to be out in the sun as he is a cancer survior and Im just paranoid really. I think they should have serviced the pool earlier in the day so we were able to enjoy it. I asked staff for a few ways to get around cause I didn't want the hassle of a car and everyone gave me a different answer. Not one person agreed on how I could get around town without sacrificing to pay for a cab. Luckily im from New York and I figured it out on my own. I made it for 5 days without paying for a cab to go anywhere I wanted. You can do it too. It was really sad that we had to go through this, but we made the best of it! I read the reviews and that's why I chose the hotel. Im really disappointed.

The grounds were immaculate, the lobby clean and inviting and the rooms were absolutely wonderful. The staff were the most amazing people I have ever met in this type of industry. They always had time to smile and say \"hello\", and were very helpful and knowledgeable. As we did not have a vehicle at our disposal, we used the shuttle service provided by the hotel to visit both Universal Parks, Seaworld and the Factory Outlets. We were very pleased with this service and their punctuality. It also afforded us the chance to see some of the other hotels we researched. We are very thankful we chose the Celebration! Set off on it's own, we were grateful for the seclusion as the other hotels seemed to be within spitting distance of each other surrounded by heavy traffic areas. And, after a long day in the heat, we opted to cool off in one of their 3 swimming pools (mostly the one with the waterfall.... gorgeous!!) And when our bones were aching from all the walking, we soothed ourselves in one of the outdoor hottubs (again, with waterfall.... love it!!). Then, as the dinner hour approached, we grabbed our dinner from the wonderful diner on the premises, and went to the lobby to enjoy family-friendly movies (even though my daughter is over 20), where we enjoyed a relaxing evening and visited with one of our favorite staff.... \"Uncle Steve\" Komives (that is, when he wasn't rushing around to take care of business or taking a moment to visit with other visitors... he's such a social butterfly!). He especially went above and beyond in his care of my daughter and myself. A true gentleman who ensured our visit was pleasurable. We shed some tears when saying our good-byes, as we had become so close. That has NEVER happened in my 46 years! We had a late departure flight, and check-out time is 11:00 a.m. I talked to Steve to see if he had any ideas as to what would be the best way to fill in the time. Within minutes, he returned with Jeff, who told us he would be extending our check-out time so that we could enjoy the hotel commodities until our shuttle came that afternoon so that we did not have to worry about what to do in the meantime! Then, as we checked out the next day, Jeff came to say good-bye to us and check that we enjoyed our stay! Of course, we said farewell to \"Uncle Steve\" about 5 times before we finally left..... My daughter and I BOTH decided without a doubt that the next time we visit Florida, we won't even bother looking for other hotels..... the seclusion, the beauty, the friendliness of the Radisson Celebration is where we'll be staying!!", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGREAT room and service but ...\u201d", "Author": "SMarie_20", "ReviewID": "UR114716626", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a trip to DW and even though the check-in time says 3 or 4 .. you might be waiting an extra 2 hours for your room to get done being cleaned.

We also ate at the breakfast buffett @ Mandolin's, was reasonably priced as our child ate for free, food was average, nothing spectacular, but was comparable to any other breakfast restaurant (like Denny's, IHop) Our waiter was very attentive, and made sure we took a box of cereal with us, if our son wanted a snack later since he was more interested in coloring at the time. Our second night there we wanted a late night snack, since we had an early dinner, and tried calling room service, got no answer, so my husband went to the diner in the lobby, and ordered and was back with food in about 20 minutes, and it cost a few dollars less than room service.

Our server, Marrian, from Morocco, was both efficient and friendly. We spent a good deal of time at the pool which was nice and well maintained. The Activitiy Director, Irafan was remarkable with his activities that kept both my teenaged kids busy and happy. He was very personable and was just great with our kids.

We booked our holiday 6 months in advance through the Expedia website, excited and content with our choice (good location and reasonably priced room). However after reading a lot of negative reviews on Trip Advisor, we became quite alarmed and worried as to what to expect of the hotel. It seemed that most travellers were concerned with the state of the room+bathroom. It didn't leave much to desire. We emailed the reservation team to request a non-smoking/king size room in Building 6000 (as recommended by fellow travellers on TA).The response wasn't quite what we expected; it didn't confirm our hotel reservation and was instead offering us a \"romance package\". As lovely as it sounded, for an $127 per night not including taxes (haha), it was not what we asked for. So we emailed them again stating we had already booked a room at their hotel and just wanted to check if it was possible to have a room in Building 6000. We got another couple of emails, which ignored the content of our emails and offered us other packages. We had to finally call the hotel for the reservation manager, Garnedy, to take over. She assured us we would have a refurbished room in the desired building. We asked for a confirmation in writing just to be sure; which we got. We are never fussy when on holidays but our good sense and their lack of communication skills, left us quite wary and thought it was a good idea to take certain measure of precaution. We emailed them 10 days before our departure, just to check that everything was in order. When we finally got to the hotel after travelling for 24 hours, we had to wait another 45mins before being able to check in. We were given a room in Building 4000 and didn't bother putting up with a fight. I just mentioned the emails and the front desk staff told me \" M'am all the rooms are the same\". Well the room was lovely, spacious and clean, to our greatest relief. The sheets and towels were changed every day and the cleaning staff was engaging and polite. Our only complaint is that we were next to the elevator and the ice room. So there was quite a bit of noise during the night. Not to mention we went there during Spring Break, so there were quite a few randy students running and screaming in the corridors in the evenings. We ate once at the hotel restaurant. The food wasn't the nicest and we found ourselves, after the first evening, wandering around the area for better restaurants and dinners. There was a bar by the pool which served great cocktails. We ordered food from the bar, which always took a while to come, but that's probably due to the fact there was only one lady (lovely by the way!) working behind the bar, taking all the order and running back and forth to the next door restaurant to get the food. There are two swimming pools in the hotel: a big one (water is cold) and a small one which is heated. We used the big one as it was most of the time empty. The hotel was packed, but we weren't at the hotel during the day, so didn't really mind or care.Overall we were pleased and had a great time!

I didn't want to pay to stay in Disney since half of our trip wasn't going to be going to the parks. I should have spent the extra money. The staff over all was friendly, except when I called down one night and was disconnected after giving my room number and wasn't called back! Room: Our first room smelled musty even though it was an updated room. The air conditioner sounded like it was going to explode and I didn't sleep. The walls are apparently thin and we heard everything around us, including the people moving furniture around upstairs. Our neighbors must get up early because around 4:00am the hallway door slammed which made our door shake loudly. Helen very happily changed our room. She was great. I've never complained before and I didn't think it was a big deal, but after everything kept piling up, I had to write a review. We were moved from the second floor to the eighth where it smelled like cigarette smoke in the hallway. Our second room had not been updated. There was no fitted sheet on the bed, just a top sheet so at your toes you could feel the bare mattress. That drove me crazy. They changed the duvet cover on our comforter and I think they put a queen size cover on the king size comforter. It didn't even cover the bed. That's when I called down and was disconnected. We were tired so I figured the sheets would be changed the next day. If you want new sheets, you have to put a card from the bathroom on your bed or they will only change them every other day, which is fine if the comforter fit the bed. I put the card on the bed and that night, same thing. Comforter was squeezed into a cover that was too small. The sleep number beds were terrible. Whether you blew it up or not, if felt like you were sleeping on a rock. There was only one \"complimentary water\" in the fridge and was never restocked during the stay. We had some pretty bad wind while we were there, which didn't effect our stay except all night the door was rattling and I had to stuff a towel underneath it so it would stop. Bathroom: I didn't find the bathroom to be too bad. It was pretty clean but when we asked for more towels, they must have given us the old worn out ones because they were nothing like the nice fluffy ones when you first get in the room. The water pressure in the shower was terrible. On one of the settings, the water just trickled out of the shower head. We asked about it a couple of times but they didn't let us know if they had looked at it. It took a while to get the soap off! Pools: There were 2 pools, 1 heated, 1 not, and a couple of hot tubs. We didn't use any but there was also a small bar outside. Restaurant: Our first night we had dinner at the hotel. I ordered the \"fall off the bone\" ribs which would have fallen off the bone if they stopped cooking an hour before. The food took forever to come out but the waiter was very nice. Without saying anything to him, he brought us some salads on the house. I ordered a half rack and got a full which was fine, but it was pretty much the ones you get already cooked in the grocery store...which I like, but at home! The bill was a bit pricey for a mediocre meal. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. Try the make-your-own waffles. That was very good! They had fresh fruit and just about everything a normal breakfast buffet has for $10 each. Not bad. The restaurant charges 18% gratuity automatically. There is the cafe by the front desk as well which has starbucks coffee and excellent egg sandwiches. We went there a couple of days too, but with coffee and juice, its just about the same price as the buffet or more depending on what kind of coffee you get. The shuttle only goes once each way per day to each park so you have to look up the times. We didn't think the times were convenient so we paid the $14 to park each day. One of the reasons I picked this hotel was because of the shuttle. Its a nice service if you don't mind being on a time schedule which, in Disney, is hard sometimes!

My daughter's high school band was to march in a Disney parade and the hotel was booked for the entire band --I just went ahead and booked our room here too. Mistake. First of all when I think of a \"resort\" I think about relaxation and recreation. The definition of \"resort\" at this hotel means \"pools\" (one too hot, one too cold). What's so special about a pool in Orlando...you can get that from 5 star hotels to $29.99 a night motels in Orlando. More importantly the room was not good. There were crumbs in the corner of the room on the carpeting when we checked in...when we checked out 5 days later the same crumbs were there. The hotel put top sheets on the matteressand tucked them under (now this I have not seen done in many,many years) so that after you layed down and got \"comfortable\" the bottom sheet was pulled up from the mattrress --thus affording you a view of a mattress that would look more appropriate on your front lawn on trash day than in a hotel...picture...old floral patterned...etc. The bathroom was so small and the elongated toilet jutted into the \"room\"so much that you had only a small square space on which to stand to towel off or dress...there were literally about 3 feet between the door and the toilet. The interior of the bathroom door was battered and rusted...there was a huge rust stain on the wall in the bathroom...the toiletries were made by Sysco. Our first night we arrived tired, hungry and late....too tired to go out for food....I ordered room service. I did not however order the hair sitting on the rim of my plate...No dinner for me that night. They have a shuttle to Disney which I thought would be great...however there was only one departure at 9am. When inquired about return times they told me that had one return at 5pm--later another parent told me that had been informed the return shuttle was at 9pm...no matter...I did not want to wake my son early every morning nor did I want to have to come back at 9, especially because the Magic Kingdom was open later than that...so I ended up paying for parking all four days at the parks. The furniture is worn. The room did not have wireless internet (what kind of place does not---I passed cheaped dives on 192 every night that advertised wireless.

The towels were rolled up, and you could see the hairs poking out. Our household is made up of redheads and brunettes. The room looked as if it were over 20 years old. Wear and tear was evident throughout. Chips in the furniture, including the mirrors, counter surfaces and tears in the carpet... all were evident. The door to the room should have clued us in since all doors in the hallway were severly damaged. The resort owners should be embarrassed. Service: I have to say that the service we received from the custodial crew was good. WE had a clogged shower and sleep number bed issues. Both were addressed quickly. Location: was good Value: We paid $60 per night, this was with priceline. Upon check in we were told of a $12 usage fee for the resort. I think it is ridiculous that resorts add these on when you are paying already above what they are worth. I was embarrassed to be staying there. Rooms: I think I have addressed this.

Also they have 1 heated pool which is boring and dirty so do yourselves a favor do not intend to use the pool facilities unless is May to October. Also in the pictures shows a double inflatable donut- well they dont even have them, they have a company that RENTs them for $10 dollars (they dont have a double donut available) and they are small. Other important thing that was my #1 dissapoinment in this hotel was the room I was in for 2 days had very little water pressure coming from the shower head, had to shower from the bottom faucet and by the 2nd day couldnt take it any longer since the shower head had 0 water coming out, they sent someone immediately but couldnt fix it until next day. after they fixed it still there was no water pressure. They comped my breakfast but I didnt feel they did enough, I had no real shower. A horrible experience, I don't feel that giving me FREE breakfast is enough given the fact that mostly all guest have free breakfast with the rates anyways. I don't think they understand how affected we were given the fact that we traveled with little children.

The catering/wedding planner never attended the reception as promised to announce/coordinate the cake cutting, champaign toast, 1st dance. I, as the mother of the groom, was left to run around like a wild woman trying to coordinate. I realized later that there was a 2nd wedding going on so I think the coordinator was busy with them. My wedding (the smaller one) got put to the side. As I am writing this, the resort manager has phoned me (Jeff) to discuss my complaints. He stated all resorts charge extra for incidentals. (I have never had this happen before). And for all my complaints he has refunded one of my nights stay.

I don't want to sound like a snob but the clientele at this hotel reminded me of a Wal Mart. Not what you would expect at a 4-star hotel.

Now the negatives. -The hotel charges a $12.50 per room, per night \"resort fee\" This is to cover internet access, transportation between parks and what they claim are \"many daily activities.\" What they don't tell you is the internet is very slow, transportation is exceptionally limited and there was no mention or postings outlining the \"many daily activities.' This hotel was full and at 718 rooms, Radisson collected just under $9,000 per night for these services. -We had requested one room to be a king but was denied as the hotel was full. -We got our kids settled in their rooms and headed to the next room where we could not gain access. Long story short, the lock was broken, we had to wait over an hour (after midnight) to get into our room. The front desk staff did not want to be bothered with this issue but the security guard dispatched to help us did everything possible to get maintenance. -I was assured this issue would be corrected first thing in the morning. I even called the front desk at 9:00 am to confirm maintenance would fix the door. When we arrived after dinner, the door was still not fixed. I did not bother calling the front desk again. The next guest will certainly have to deal with this issue. -The common areas of the hotel smell of cigarette smoke as people congregate at the side entrances smoking with the doors propped open.

The carpets were disgusting; the walls in the hallways reminded me of section 8 housing. When entering our room the same continued within.

It never let's me down. The price is always great for what you get. I stay here whenever I visit Universal Studios because the hotel provides a shuttle to and from the park. I like the pool area and landscaping here. They have 3 pools. One huge pool with a small water slide and a water fall. 2 smaller pools I would consider kids pools. And 2 hot tubs. One is on the main walkway and another is tucked away in the greenery. The grounds are very well kept here and they always have been even in previous years visits. They have started doing daily activities which was cool. Things from poolside bingo, to table tennis tournaments, and so much more. They give away kids prizes and free drinks to the bar for the adults. There is a big bar outside and a tiki hut by the pool that serves as a towel stand/music stand. The lobby looks really nice. There is plenty of parking and some cool resteraunts in walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Although the prices looked like they were waiting for the tourists. Let's just say I paid $10 for a case of water. I'm use to paying $5 in NY. oh well. There is plenty to do here if you don't plan to swim in the pools. They have plenty of lounge chairs. Some show wear and tear but then again most lounge chairs sitting out In the florida sun do. They have table tennis, fooz ball (sp?), basketball, tennis courts, an arcade with a variety of about 10-15 games, a fitness center, a gift shop, a deli/convenience store, a resteraunt/sports bar. Now for the downsides of the resort. They do add an extra $12.50 per day as a resort fee. This covers the shuttles to Disney, Universal, Seaworld, Ect... It covers the pool side activities, and probably the poolside service for towels and the poolside games like table tennis and fooz ball. It's worth it though. I like to go to one place that will keep us entertained without dropping a ton of cash. You can't get a taxi to and from a park and they can shuttle you and do all the other stuff for $12.50. People have mentioned the wear and tear. I do see this as well. For example the elevators look like Someone took a key and scratched the stainless steel doors. Some of the wooden decor on the walls of the elavators are chipped. Some dings and dents in the walls where a door might have opened and hit the wall or a suitcase has scratched it here and there. The tile in the bathroom shows some age and coloring. The decor in the rooms feel very 90's. But it's nice and clean. Ya it's not a flat screen tv, but instead you get a sleep number bed. I'm actually laying in it right now as I type this and I must say it's like laying in a cloud. So your not getting the ritz or Hilton for the price of a super 8 here. But I think you are paying for a 3 star hotel/resort and that's exactly what your getting. The staff has always been friendly. They don't seem to go out or their way for you, but they also have never been rude to us either. I'm sure as time goes on things will keep improving here and I will keep coming back. But if your like me and want to get the most of your $. Then give this resort a try. Your kids will enjoy it no doubt. You will save a ton of $ that you will have to turn around and spend in a park anyways. And in the end you will have a really nice vacation. Just don't sweat the chip in paint here or th ding in the wall there. It is what it is. It's clean, it's safe, and affordable and so close to everything. Enjoy!!!

Our family normally plans our Disney trips in advance-- but this year we went on an impromptu trip and thought this hotel would be just right to save us some money since we were not staying as long as usual. Never again will we stay at this location. Usually we stay at a Disney hotel and this impromptu trip just confirmed that we will do that in the future. Normally our family will give a place a chance but this one did not make the grade. If you go by the pictures --the Radisson looks like a wonderful place to stay.

These amenities should be included in the price of the hotel. Needless to say I felt very ripped off considering I was paying $50 for a night and had to pay a $12.50 resort fee in addition- that's a 25% increase in the price of the hotel!

I did see a bit of peeling wallpaper in one area, but it was not a sign to leave. We were on the eighth floor and when we got off the elevator, I was sure they had put us in a smoking room because of the aroma in the hallway. I couldn't manage to get online. But, then, I am used to wireless and the room had broadband, so it was probably my fault. It wasn't important that day anyway. Pros: We arrived early to check out the hotel and they happily checked us right in to our room. The room was just perfect for us. No cigarette smell at all. Everything was clean. The sleep number bed was great for this couple. The bathroom looked like it had recently been redone with a granite vanity top and marble tiled shower. It was a gorgeous day and we decided to go down to the pool, which we had not seen yet. The large pool was not heated (don't know about the \"kids\" pool), but it was lovely! There are two pools and two hot tubs and plenty of lounge chairs. The landscaping surrounding the pool is hard scape i.e. manufactured rock walls, and waterfalls and lots of foliage where you feel nestled in and pampered. The music they played was perfect and then, a live musician! Of course, he played Buffet, James Taylor and that sort and we spent about three hours lounging and enjoying the first day of vacation. There is a game room, but we didn't go in. Free parking too. Oh, the resort fee is $12.50 per night, which is added to your bill after the fact. Apparently, this is common in FL, but I had already known about it, so it wasn't a shock, like it had been to some reviewers. ( I guess that is a 'con') Would I spend a week there?

Our Safe couldn`t be fixed so we were offered new rooms in Block 6000, at no extra charge. These rooms had been newly decorated and were clean, quiet and comfortable. The WiFi is fee providing you use your own lap top, and not the key board in the room. The Pool Areas were clean and Bird Poo free!!! and the pools were warm.

The stay in Florida was nice but the weather didn't quite get as warm as I'd of liked, low 70's to low 60's. Compare it to Chicago though and it was a heat wave. We got our car with Payless and had a reservation got the Camry, car was very nice had no problems at all. The cost for this car was for 6 days with all the insurance was right at $300 and if you don't have to take all the insurance you can save $30 a day. The next thing is get the map that they give you you need it to find your way around. OK now the hotel we book from here and got the room for the two of us for $59.00 a night but it doesn't tell you that they charge for about everything you do, they charge you another $11.50 for there stuff, the amenities, the pool, the water slide, the spa. etc. I had another reservation with the hotel for two days less and the front desk called me in my room to tell me that they were going to have to charge me one night's stay on that reservation, I told the girl at the front desk that I had cancel that reservation when I made the one I was using, Well after I talked to the manger they decided not to charge me. The first night in the hotel I did find a dead Silverfish, about 2 inches long in the bathroom under the sink, I got a tissue and picked it up and I must say did not see any other bugs the whole time. Room itself wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect. The TV cable system was screwed up the whole time,they had a channel that you could buy movies to watch and the whole time it didn't work. They keep saying that the cable company was going to get it fixed but it never happened while we were there. The bed left me sore in my back, now I'm 50 years old and 50 lbs overweight and my son didn't complain so I'm not sure if it was me or not but I never have problems at home. The game room is kind of small its got around 10 or 12 games, nothing new. The restaurant is just like all the other restaurants in Orlando high priced and the sports bar the same $5 Drafts, $6.95 for a draft and hot dog $9.00 for a draft and burger. They do have a pizza hut at the hotel basically $15.00 for a medium peperoni pizza, the pizza was one of the best with a ton of cheese but expensive. If you have to make a phone call and you pick up the phone expect to be charged, I made 2 calls while their and found out they were considered long distance $5.50 each, use your cell phone. Oh there are a limited number of plug ins in the rooms,one beside the coffee pot,one in the bathroom and one on the desk lamp I must tell everyone about 3 things in Florida. First make sure if this is your first time to bring a lot of cash or your credit card everything cost's at least a $20 if not more. It was just me and my son and it's hard to get a meal for less than $20. and Disney World is worse figure at least $10 a head per meal per person and go to Wal-mart to buy your trickets, you'll save a ton. Next go see the Blue Man Group at Universal one of the best buys there and tickets are not cheap $70 for mine and $25 for my son, but a completely outstanding show had us laughing the whole damn time. Last the last night we were their in Orlando we went to Joe's Crab Shack on 192 just Hwy 4. One of the best place's I've ever been too. The food was outstanding,the wait staff was Great and friendly. They sang and danced (with my son) they made it fun, the building provides a perfect atmosphere for them. COMPLETELY enjoyed them and the food.

There were also cigarette burn marks in the pillow and the sheet. The entire hotel smelt very musty and molding. The elevator is the worst. It literally smells like someone threw up. The floor matches the smell as well; it is heavily stained and \"mushy\", giving you that nice just puked on feeling. This hotel is not like any Raddison I have ever seen or stayed in. It was very uncomfortable and dirty. I could go on and on. The hallways had holes on the wall, exit signs were hanging from the ceiling. It was like a bad joke. We felt like the place was closed down, but for some reason they were letting people stay there. The only nice parts were the lobby and the pool. Not sure how it compares for transportation purposes, but most parks only had one depart and pick-up time. The only exception was Disneyworld, which had three departure times. They had a restaurant, but it was never open.If you are looking for a cheap place, I would reccomend a Hotel 6 or Holiday Inn.

It poured one day and every pathway had canopy cover which made it easy and dry to get around. Shuttle was on time regularly except once we arrived one minute late at Epcot stop #24 and was told by others waiting for next door shuttle he had left about 3-4 minutes early even though he had waited about 5 minutes. My watch was accurate as we checked so that didn't thrill us. However, shuttle driver in #23, turned out to be same one who dropped us off earlier and was now on another route, took his passengers and then took us to the Radisson which was very nice. Note your times and service for 4 people was worth the $11.30 they charge per day per room. Some kids and adult activites were fun and similar to what we have had on cruise ships. Complments to Radisson for adding something extra. We won drinks in one contest. Lobby was exquisite, grounds well kept with 3 pools to choose from (one heated) and two saunas. Would love to stay there for a week and mix the days with the theme parks and some days enjoy the sun and facilities. Did not eat at the Mandolin as we were out and about although had late snack at the little diner inside which was fine. Grocery store close by isn't great but with a car everytihg is close enough.

The lobby is beautiful. The grounds are beautiful. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The room was OK and the comments about not staying on the first floor due to the damp smell was right on--even in November. Like others, we got a pretty good deal at a discount website and we found that it was a really good option for those with families who are going to spend most of the day at the parks. Most helpful for economic considerations was the in-room refrigerator which saved a lot of time and money on breakfast and late night dinners. When you have a small child it is a good idea to serve breakfast in the room quickly so that you can spend most of the day at the park. I don't think we would have made the early shuttle if we had to go out anywhere first. The shuttle runs to Disneyworld several times a day and back at times which will allow you to stay until the fireworks close at Magic Kingdom. It was a good value considering parking at Disney is now $14. Best of all, we got to the park so early that we were able to get on the rides in the morning with little or no waiting. (Again, it was also the off-season). Like others have said, the \"resort fee\" seems a little inappropriate as this is not a \"resort\" but the tradeoff is that you can take the free shuttle and the extra fee is less than Disney parking. It's also much less hassle than driving and parking yourself. I considered this a definite plus. The room was OK. It was a little dated and seemed a little Vegas-inspired but it was comfortable and the beds were fine. The Internet was spotty. It worked fine the first day but not the next. I didn't try the restaurant but we did get suckered by the deli prices for a canned coffee and a chocolate milk--$6. That's worse than Disney charges! Some prices at the Pizza Hut/ deli looked reasonable--ask before you order. In general, though, it was a pretty good experience and we liked it. The location was fantastic. It was easy to find, close to the park and located very near strip malls with many shops and even a movie theater.

Took a package for $184/night that included two four-day adult Disney passes and breakfasts for all four of us. When you net out the cost of the Disney tickets ($55 per day per adult) and breakfasts, the hotel room was effectively $30-40 per night. If they offer the Magic Your Way package, consider it. Prior to November 2009, we had stayed at the hotel three times, most recently in 2003. Here are some observations: LOCATION: You cannot beat it. The hotel is at the intersection of 192 and 4. If you don't know where that is, it is 1.5 miles from Main Gate. Or, stated differently, it'll be a 10 minute drive or less to any of the Disney parks. No one can reasonably dispute that this hotel is in a prime location to visit any of the Disney parks. ROOM: We were in room 1324 - 1000 Building - 3rd floor - at the end. Room was fine. Think three-star quality. Room size was large. Decor was a bit dated, but not old. Bathroom was large. Water pressure in shower not so great. Not enough hangers in closets - consider bringing some. Drawer storage was woefully inadequate - three small drawers under TV. If you'll be staying for more than 3-4 days, you may not be able to unpack all your stuff. Can hear noise outside of room rather easily. SERVICE: Housekeeping was excellent. They tended to the room promptly and did an excellent job. Five-star quality here. Try to avoid Guest Services desk. Not referring to front desk - they were fine - did a nice job when called upon. Guest Services is run by a tour operator, which tries to sell you stuff. I had to wait 30 minutes to pick up the included Disney tickets - they kept bypassing me when they saw I was just there to pickup the free tickets and was not buying other stuff from them. RESTAURANT: Ate at Mandolin's for breakfast each morning. Buffet on Sat/Sun and a la carte from menu during week. Food was very good. Nice portions. Service was very slow, but I'd blame that on understaffing as opposed to poor wait staff. Tough to serve an entire restaurant with two waiters and one busboy. Menu prices were about $10 for a large-sized breakfast. Believe the buffet was $14, although did not see price. Buffet was also very good - omelete station, fresh waffles, pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausauges, potatoes, fruits, pastries. Definitely a good way to get fuel before heading off to the parks. MISCELLANEOUS: The layout of the hotel complex can be confusing. Picked it up after a few days. Be aware that there is Wi Fi in only portions of the hotel. The 1000 Building does not have Wi Fi - so if this is important to you - make sure you request a spot closer to the main building for reception. Pools were well maintained, but rather empty. Kids loved the heated pool. Parking is iffy. If you arrive back at the hotel after 8pm, you may have to park a bit of a distance from your room. Not a big deal, but others have noted it. Prices at the deli are really high, so consider going to the Publix down the street and stocking the in-room fridge. We did not, but should have! If you're looking for a good meal without getting ripped off, there is a Logan's about 2 miles down the road. Think Outback. You can get a really good meal for about $10-15.

When we arrived we found the hotel to be very pleasant in its surroundings and clean and tidy. We were given our room key and we drove round to our car parking area and found the room pretty easily. We did realise soon that evening that finding a spot close to where you staying is hard especially when you are coming home late after visiting the parks. After saying that tho there is plenty of spaces you may just have to park a little further away. Our room was big enough for myself my husband and 2 boys aged 4 and 11 at the time. We had 2 double beds that are sooo comfy and you can ask for additional pillows if you need them. The room had its own bathroom which was very clean and had bath/shower toilet and sink with plenty of space to move. The room also had a hairdryer which was handy as i forgot to pack mine!!!. We could have done with a little more drawer and wardrobe space as i thought that for a room that sleeps 4 people there was not near enough but didnt ruin our stay at all it just meant i lived mainly out of my suitcase for the stay. The pools were lovely too. One of them is heated which was great for me and my youngest son as we dont like cold water much and the larger pool is lovely and looked almost tropical. Our room overlooked the pool on the ground floor and had patio doors that led out to it but they were permanently locked maybe for security ??. There is eateries in the hotel but we ate out everyday as there is ample restaraunts of every taste to choose from around the area. We hired a car to get around and figured we did need one to get the best out of our holiday although none drivers would still be ok at this hotel.

There is so much to see and do in the day and evenings that keeps you away from your hotel. If your room wherever you may be staying is not up to your liking let the reception know first and if they cant move you ask yourself this....is this problem going to ruin my chances of having the best time of my life and will it put me off orlando in the future if your answer is no then maybe the odd little thing you can live with just using it as a base to store your belongings.

(and others as well). If you're looking for a 5 star hotel, this is not the place. I would definitely rate this a 3.5-4 star. This hotel was way above average for cleanliness, amenities, restaurant choices, atmosphere, everything! I was impressed. I booked our room at radisson.com, it was actually cheaper than all of the other discount internet sites! Yes, there is a 'resort fee' of $12 on top of the room fee. BUT, the total for our awesome room/stay was $92 TOTAL. This was your basic room with king bed (which was a bit firm/hard), but I slept fine. We were fortunate to have a room in the 6000 building right next to the smaller pool & jacuzzi nearby. Everthing is within walking distance at the resort/hotel. We had dinner in the Sports bar, food was good, service was good, and like any other place...a little more $$, but worth the convenience! I want to write this review for your average family, couple, traveler... who appreciates & understands a good deal! This place is perfect for families. The pool, slide, games, game room, ping pong, etc. Yet, couples who want to get away & not spend a fortune. We escaped for the weekend without our children. I will definitely stay at this hotel every time we go to Orlando now. It is very close to all attractions. The landscaping & atmosphere was very nice, the staff was friendly, the hotel common areas were clean, our room was clean & pretty (no odors whatsoever), the pool area was clean & we always saw employees walking around & keeping things tidy. Don't waste your time/money on the 'discount' hotels, this is the same $$ or maybe $10 more per night.... but well worth it! I hope this review helps others when making their choice.

When I called Radisson central reservations to request a non-smoking room they told me I couldnt request anything since I booked through hotwire. \"You take whats left. I cant even see your reservation since you booked through hotwire. Youll have to check in and see what they'll give you.\" I was a bit angry so I called the hotel directly expecting a fight. The receptionist could not have been nicer. She appologized and put in my requests (sleep number bed, non smoking , quiet room away from pool and high speed internet) On arrival: The place is beautifully landscaped with fountains and waterfalls, ducks in several lakes..gorgeous. I needed a couple extra days and I had booked two more days through hotwire to follow the first 5 days I booked through hotwire. The clerk was very nice but a bit confused so she got the manager who was wonderful. She made sure I had everything I asked for and made sure that my stay would all be in the same room. The room: 4000 wing, 6th floor. From the reviews I expected old outdated furnishings. Not so. The room was decorated very contemporary, no stains on the carpet and no rips in the drapes.. The bathroom had granite counters and marble floors.The bed linens were all white with a washable white bedspread. Yes..they do wash them. I saw the housekeepers linen cart. My only complaint..the shower looked well used and had a mildew smell coming from the shower curtain. Not bad but I could tell it was there. Rather than ask for a new one, I washed it with a little bleach in the tub and all was fine. I'm sure they would have replaced it had I asked. The a/c was great and no more noisy than any other hotel I've stayed at. The sleep number bed was amazingly comfortable and the room was quiet enough that I could take a nap mid-day. Ammenities: I did not eat at the restaurants. The pools are excellent and there are hot tubs scattered around also. As mentioned, its beautiful and well maintained. Transportation leaves several times per day but I never used it. Last shuttle picks up at EPCOT at 1045pm. Fireworks are at the Magic Kingdom at 10pm this week lasting about 20 minutes leaving about 20 minutes to get from the MK to Epcot via monorail.

Location is great, down the street from lots of eating establisments and I was at the Contemporay Resort every day within 10 minutes. Both hotwire AND the Radission were up from about the $11.00 resort fee. Anyone surprised by that fee never bothered to read the web site including hotwires. No one tried to hide that they charge that fee. Wireless internet was plenty fast. Exercise room with several treadmills and a few universal type weight machines and light freeweights. Overall: NICE, HELPFUL staff..very friendly. Room was not outdated, was clean (including the fridge) Maybe slghtly worn but with this kind of turnover you have to expect that even in a more expensive hotel.

The main goal of this trip was to find a reasonable price hotel with a nice pool/waterslide to spend two days. Accomplished. I would go back only because of the variety of pools and water features on site and the low cost ($96 per night included a very good breakfast buffet). Without breakfast the rate would have been in the $70 range (purchased direct from the hotel). There were three pools; one kiddie, one large with waterslide and waterfall and a heated pool. There were two hot tubs, one of them had a really cool waterfall to stand underneath. We spent most of our time in the heated pool because the large pool seemed a bit cold. It was overcast and not quite as hot outside when we visited but I managed to get a few trips down the waterslide. There was also a fun giant chess/checkerboard. There were lots of ponds, fountains, waterfalls etc. There were families of ducks and turtles that would almost walk up and eat out of your hand. My 18 month old son enjoyed the baby ducks. My son also enjoyed watching the airplanes overhead except for seeing the occasional naked people standing in the room windows with curtains wide open LOL. The room. Hmmmm the room is another story. I have a feeling that there may have been nicer, more newer sections of the hotel. Our main goal was the pool so I didnt request to be moved. Our room was in bad need of refreshing. The carpet was frayed, the picture was missing from the wall exposing three large holes. The furniture was beat up. There was what looked to be 1980's blue tile in the shower with black mildew stains and a really gross rusted/mildew area under the tub spout. There were granite tiles on the floor and a different color granite sink area. The walls looked beat up. The A/C unit in the room appeared to be falling out of the wall. The room was VERY small; no room for a side chair like I normally find in this scale of hotel. There was a small desk/table and computer hookups. The room had the usual fridge, iron, safe and standard TV. Sleep Number beds were available, but this room didnt have them. The duvet was nice and the bed was very hard and cheap feeling. I happen to like hard beds so that didnt bother me but my wife said she has slept on floors that were more comfortable. I think the $11.30 resort fee would be worthwhile if you need shuttle service to the parks, but in my case the $11.30 didnt really offer us anything else.

I went here as my first holiday without parents and my first time I had travelled to America. I also worked for a large UK travel company at the time (Virgin). The day I was due to travel I realised that I had made a huge error and had booked the flights for March (which it was) and the hotel for February (a month ago). I arrived at the hotel and played innocent (did not mention I worked for Virgin) to which the members of staff instantly said \"Ok, we can't find your booking, but you have been traveling a long time as you have come from London. We will put you in a room, come to reception in the morning and we will let you know what is going on\". The next day I went down to reception and instantly they remembered who I was and told me that they had sorted the problem, and if I was happy with the room then I could stay there, which I did. The next self inflicted problem I had was that I forgot my tickets to Discovery Cove (left in the UK). My parents faxed them to the hotel (before I knew they were missing) and I had them waiting for me in my room, didn't have to chase the hotel for them. The pool was lovely, the breakfasts were like all hotel breakfasts (expensive) but not over the top! I have been to Orlando twice now and the Coaches from this hotel were great, the only problem is that if you want to see the fireworks at Disney you will miss the last coach how, however a taxi is about $18 so not the end of the world! At the time of staying I was quite young and I remember thinking \"its a shame I had booked such a nice hotel, because we were not using it as I was out all day\" but having stayed in the best western Lakeside a year later which was ok, but not great I now look back and think it was a good choice. Oh yeah there is also a pizza hut and sandwich shop in the hotel. If you are British don't be fooled by the pizza hut. Not that British Pizza hut is great but American pizza hut is very different and not in a good way. We pretty much ended up having a sandwich for dinner every night!! If you find the time I really advise going to the shops for some healthy food! So yes, not a straight forward review but the one thing that really stands out with this hotel is service. I know its easy to judge that someone who books a hotel for the wrong month and is in his early 20's may not know about it but I am lucky enough to have stayed in many 5 star hotels as a teenager across the world and this 3/4 star is really up there with service quality!

Original reservation was for Apr 23 -25th, checking out on the 26th. However, due to a change in schedule, I called 72 hours prior to the 23rd and requested for the reservation to be changed. I needed to push everything up by one day, so I cancelled arriving on the 23rd and extended leaving to the 27th. Upon arriving very late on the 24th, or early on the 25th, I was told that I did not have a reservation. I did have my confirmation number but the clerk in the mean time found my reservation but said it was for checking in on the 25th and out on the 27th. And, there were not any rooms available except for something with a pull out sofa bed. I was told that one roll-away bed could be added but that the room would not accomodate two. There were 4 people in my party, and at this point, I'm very tired and pretty much upset . I tried not to take it out on the night clerk, as I know it was not his fault. Before I could decide, I was told that there was a room available in the smoking section of the hotel that had two double beds. I agreed to take that toom as long as I could move the next day. I have stayed in rooms designated for smokers before and hadn't really noticed or had a problem. This, however, was totally horrible for us as the smoke smell hit us as soon as we stepped off the elevator onto the 8th floor. I called room service for some air freshner, which they promptly brought up. But, it did not help very much. We made the best of it and anxiously waited to be moved the next day. A plus on this particular room or floor, the internet at least worked. The next day, I requested to move as soon as possible. The clerk at the front desk was very nice and did call us as soon as there was a room available. We moved into a room on the first floor which intially seemed to be alot better. However, the internet did not work nor could we access wireless. We called the front desk twice on this matter and they sent someone up the 2nd time but he did not know what to do. He changed out the cable but that didn't help. Later on, as one o fus was lounging on the inside of one of the doulbe beds another horrible odor was detected. It smelled like someone had vomitted. The smell seemed to be coming from between the two beds up near the wall. I assume that someone had gotten sick and the smell was lingering in the carpet. We asked housekeeping to clean while we were out and upon our return, it did smell better - or so we thought. Later, this same odor was detected again. It was not something you could smell constantly (thankfully); however, when you did smell it, it was bad. We had some perfumed sprays we kept using as none of us wanted to go through the ordeal of having to move yet again. On the 27th, as we returned to our building from going to our car, we actually smelled the same disgusting scent upon entering the building. Now I don't know if what I smelled was exclusive to the room we were in or if it was something rank in the ventilation system of the building. However, I did tell the clerk when I checked out that I strongly suspected someone had been sick in the room and the carpet needed to be shampooed.

My partner attended a conference, while I stayed at the hotel. Then we spent 2 days a WDW. The Radisson was a disappointment overall. It would definitely be the most disappointing Radisson we have ever stayed in, which is probably over a dozen in various US cities. It is obvious this Radisson was a property they acquired and have not spent the money to upgrade it to the standard of the Radisson brand. I would put it overall below almost all business focused hotels and certainly below \"resort\" status. First the positive things: Room: the pillows and shower were very good, and we usually find the pillows in almost all hotels to be too soft. Having a free mini-fridge (actually quite large) that was not a pre-stocked mini-bar was great. It easily could have held > 24 cans of pop. It was nice to have a free electronic safe (though it was rather beat up). The air conditioning system was easy to use and did a great job. Though the room smelled musty most of the time. Room service was prompt, the food was pretty good, and reasonable in price - just very few options on the menu for any meal. We ate the breakfast buffet once, which is over priced for the variety and quality of food offered. The pools and pool area was nice. If you have kids, they organize a lot of activities around the pool and there is a large arcade. The Exercise room held all fairly new equipment - and all the cardio machines worked and were in good condition. There just wasn't many of them. The \"deli\" in the main bldg was open probably 20 hours a day and had a lot of options for food, snacks, beverages etc. The free bus transportation to WDW Epcot transfer station was pretty much right on schedule - there just isn't many trips per day. The bad: The room was dirty. Some sort of beverage was all over the bed room mirror. There was mold all around the sink under the counter over-hang. The toilet ran almost continuously. Some days they took the towels and then did not leave enough. Some towels were fairly plush, yet others were very thin and should have been tossed. The TV was an old 27\" that had no input for video game/dvd player. The remote did not work to enable you to do anything other than change channels/control the volume. So no Menu options to adjust the picture, go to on-demand movies etc. Radisson advertises their \"Sleep Number\" beds - which they had, but good luck finding a setting that would stick. We thought we would set it at a number we liked, and the next morning it had either deflated and was too soft, or seemed to stiffen up on it's own. We finally gave up. Through out the property there were damaged walls (broken or missing tiles, ripped wall paper, gouges in the walls. etc). While the pool area is nice, the LOUD music they play from their Tiki Hut is way too much. If you sat near it, it was impossible to have a conversation.

We even can hear the people next door to us and people in the hallway. We also put a please do not disturb sign in the front door and the housekeeping ignored it and still came in to clean.

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THIS TIME; it took them 1 1/2 hours to bring up 2 salads and a bowl of what they called Minestrone soup; really it was just tomatoe chunk soup; we complained and the whole $45.00 charge was taken off our bill. they do charge $11 resort fee, and they do charge for rollaway beds ($11); they do not charge for cribs; there is a safe in the room; they did not provide much of anything. there was one bar of soap and one small (very small) bottle of shampoo. the maids did a really poor job of cleaning; basically they replaced towels and made the bed. there is a refridgerator. there is also a walmart and a walgreens right down 192 if you need little stuff; there is also a publix supermarket across the way from the walgreens. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE KOBE STEAK HOUSE; WE WENT TWO TIMES THIS VISIT AND TWICE BEFORE; GREAT; SO WORTH IT!!!!. overall, you get what you pay for; we weren't expecting much; basically its where we slept and hung out, which it was fine for. the pools are really nice; gym was nice; and there were a bunch of mother ducks that just had babies; we fed them daily which was really nice. my daughter loved it; you can feed the fish too. we had to make an unexpected trip to the ER (daughter had fever of 106!!!) and thank goodness the ER is right across the street from the resort; really close to everything.", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice spot for families\u201d", "Author": "MomofoneMI", "ReviewID": "UR27615480", "Content": "I wasn't sure what to expect on this one.

Joseph at the restaurant is the nicest server I have ever met he definitely made dinner a great experience. The food is kinda expensive but there is so many restuarants on the strip so it is not even an issue but trust me if you have the money eat there trust me you will thank me. There are two pools one heated one not but kids love the cold pool and it is nice to get a quick cool down. The waterslide is nice never used it but went to disney a lot so didn't really have time. There is lots to on the resort too for those days you need a break. Some things not mentioned in others are they a ping pong table have paddle and rackets just not very good. They have a mini basketball, arcarde, beach volleyball court and tennis courts are near the parking lot not near the pool and the tennis courts are lit. This is a huge resort but very easy to get around and trust me don't be scared of the size it is big but seems smaller because it keeps everything central. My bed was a king bed sleepnumber was very nice and they were nice enough to change into a non-smoking room (got a deal on expedia look on this for cheaper rates as well one you bid on can't remember the name). There is a pizzahut right next to the pool you can order through the window as well as other food. They have a nice bar by the pool great dacquiris, inside bar is nice bartender is pretty cool huge projection sreen inside and very comfortable chairs trust me. Beer is kinda expensive by draught not by bottle and they put an 18% surcharge on it but it is okay for a couple go buy beer at Walmart if you wanna drink NO GLASS CONTAINERS BUT BRING DOWN YOUR OWN DRINKS I DID AND THEY DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

We arrived to the hotel around 9pm and got to our room as soon as we opened the door the smell of nasty old hotel room filled the hallway. The room had appeared to have recieved new surface treatment but underneath it, it was NASTY. Upon setting our luggage down we went to put some water in our mini fridge to discover, that is was fully stocked. But not with food that the Radisson placed there. Old milk, chinese food, chicken wings and more moldy delictble goodies. After discovering the mini fridge, my friend and I decided that it would be a good idea to check the beds, man was that a mistake. In one pee stains and other misc. items, and in the other one what appeared to be food and hair. The bathroom, was suprisingly the only clean part of the room. So after this inspection we ventured to the lobby to get our room cleaned. around 9:45pm the housekeeper showed up with just a towel, and left, leaving the room in the origional condition. We went back to the front desk around 10:15 to ask for a complete cleaning, that was a mistake it took until 11:45pm for them to finish cleaning the room. Then we discovered that the drapes wouldn't close all the way so the hanger with clips from the closet came in handy. Then aroun 1:15 am a employee came to our room to inform us that our room had a broken tub. But our tub was not broken, and did not listen when we tld him our tub was fine. So in five minutes he had taken apart and put back together the tub to tell us that the tub was fine. It ends up our friends room directly above us their tub was broken. So after laying down (on towels) in the bed we discovered that the room appars to have been involved in a fire. The fire sprinkler was rusted and inspection of the rooms walls showed that 2 of the four in the sleeping area had different texture and paint color than the rest. In the morning we left for breakfast at the restaurant to be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the breakfast. That night we discovered we had gotten eight towels that pretty much took up the entire vanity area.

Also the smell and mold in the room that has been mentioned in previous requests was present and accounted for.

I'll get the not-so-great stuff out of the way, right off the bat: 1. This hotel complex was most likely built in the early 1980s, and was last upgraded in the early 2000s. It's beginning to show a little wear from the last \"Modern Italian\" upgrade. 2. The beds are harder than one would expect, which is bad if you like the pillow-topped experience (but good if you want less material to attract bed bugs and Florida critters.) 3. The $10 a day \"resort fee.\" Just charge me the fee upfront. I hate all the back end charges to maintain the illusion of a lower price. In fact, you might attract a higher caliber of tourist if you just added the $10 a day back into the cost. Here's the good stuff, and why you should stay here: 1. Clean rooms and facilities. In Orlando, this is a great boon. 2. Being on the \"right\" side of the 192 interchange, nearer to Celebration, in an office park/residential feeling area, rather than the tourist trap that is 192 in Kissimee. 3. Shuttles to Disney. Not too shabby. 4. Full compliment of gift shop, bar and restaurants, with Mandolins serving some great chow. 5. The pool area is stunning. Seriously. Too cold to play, but great to look at. 6.

I have a bunch of minor complaints that may sound like this hotel faired poorly... but there was never a point where I disliked the hotel or felt the urge to leave or anything like that. First, the hotel looks really nice from the outside, the lobby area and landscaping is beautiful and, for the most part, the grounds are pretty clean. Room was adequate. We stayed in room 2311 (I think) which had a king size sleep number bed. Complaint #1 was that housekeeping reset the sleep number every single day. Contrary to what the website says, not all the rooms feature Sleep Number beds. I would suggest requesting a sleep number bed, if only because you know the room has been recently renovated/switched over. Bathroom was nice. Toilet flushed slowly, but there was adequate pressure from the shower. Decor wasn't any more or less dated than any other hotel I've stayed at in the DW area. Website also claims a daily resort fee of $10/day which is actually $11.30/day after tax. Ok, so here are my main complaints. First, I really hate to complain about shuttle service... but the shuttle to SeaWorld dropped us off AN HOUR BEFORE THE PARK OPENED. We left the hotel early but I just assumed that we would be stopping at area hotels and get there right about the time the park opened. Standing around for an hour in the parking lot before the park opened was beyond annoying. Second, the resort has 2 pools with 2 extreme temperatures. The main pool featuring the waterfall in the pics is not heated. The second pool is heated to bathwater temps, which, in my opinion, is gross. Now, we were there during a cold snap in Florida so maybe the non-heated pool isn't usually an issue, but the non-heated pool was FREEZING. The news said the ocean temp was 59 degrees and the pool felt colder than when I stepped in the ocean. There is a pond in front of the hotel that is really gross. I felt bad for the wildlife in and around the pond because there was garbage and debris floating in and all around the pond. Like some of the reviews have said, the \"guest services and ticket center\" is really a timeshare salesman. I really don't have a problem with this except when they give you bad information. I HATE concierge-type services that aren't informed (see my review for the Atlantis). We wanted to see the cirque de soleil (sp?) and asked about ticket prices and showtimes, etc. He gave us ticket prices and we drove to Downtown Disney to see the show where we were promptly informed by the Box Office that the show was on vacation, returning the following Tuesday. They were also no help for anything in the Tampa area. Overall though, we did enjoy the hotel. My gf loved the duck family, especially the baby ducks. Like I said, a bunch of minor complaints, but nothing that dimenished from the overall hotel experience.

Since we'd stayed at POP for a week in Nov. 2008, we decided off-site would be fine this quick trip. So, we decided to do Priceline to try to save money. We felt that the $50 rate was a good deal for the room we got, and were very happy with our Radisson experience. The resort fee was not a surprise, and I didn't feel like it was that much of an issue since, even with that added on, we still got a good rate. The room at the Radisson was nicer than the Disney value rooms, and it was convenient to have a fridge in the room at no extra charge. Disney charges extra for a fridge.

She found me another room which was a much nicer room and more of what I was expecting. It was at this point that the manager finally showed her face, but no apologies from the management at all. I did receive very good service from the young lady who checked me in. I wish I had wrote her name down. The new room was fine except for two days straight I did not get any clean wash cloths.

The concierge desk was helpful by helping us get discount tickets to SeaWorld and free breakfast but it will cost you half a day of listening to time share information.

There is a nice waterfall and you are surrounded by palm trees. There is a water slide for the kids. There is a warmer pool and 2 hot tubs.

The room we received was fine - needs a little updating and the carpet could sure use some cleaning - but there was really nothing major to complain about as far as the room goes. It seemed to be a very busy hotel and the parking lot was quite crowded. My husband has a disabled placard but all the spaces were occupied. We had to park quite far from our building and in the parking lot, it seems the farther away you get from the buildings, the darker it gets. We parked where there were no light whatsoever. A little spooky to say the least. The layout of the hotel is a little confusing as well. Once you leave the reception area and drive to your building (yes I said drive - it is a HUGE property) - the road you are supposed to go down is not clearly marked and it seems as though you are going down a narrow alley. It certainly could use a sign or two directing guests in the right direction. We also got lost inside the hotel as the buildings don't go straight in a row 2000 - 3000- 4000 - 5000...thankfully there are signs along the way so you can navigate. Finally - I was prepared for the \"surprise\" added resort fee that many have mentioned here. We were told that the $11 fee covered transportation to the theme parks, the use of the pool, refrigerators in the room, and activities around the resort (and a few other things I can't recall) - NONE of which we were going to use. We were told it didn't matter if we used them or not, that the fee was charged to everyone. Seems to me it would make more sense ro charge $11 more a day for the room than to make people mad by adding an extra charge after-the-fact.

They really need assigned parking next to the particular building you are booked into. It is a huge complex and women travelling alone for business should be able to park closer to their particular building when they have to come back in the dark. Assigned parking would resolve that issue because the complex is huge and the parking on the other side was just about empty even though there was a huge building on that side.

Coming from someone who's family business is in Restoration (fires, water damage), it smelled like there had been severe flooding and the clean up was not as complete as it should have been. It may look cleaned up on the outside but inside where mold and bacteria are unseen is the big worry. Needless to say, it set the tone for what it felt like to be in the room. It felt dirty and unclean. None of us unpacked as we were afraid our clothes would pick up the mildewy smell, not to mention the worry of the cleanliness of the room. The front desk people were pleasant when I requested a new room but were a little confused when I told them the reason why. I suspect they probably have no idea what the rooms are really like past the front desk. She was going to put me in a room directly across from ours and I needed to repeat that the whole building smelled and could we please be put in another buidling. She put us in building 1000 and it was the same problem. The $79.00 rate I stayed at was great but was it because of the condition of the place?

We were somewhat apprehensive on arrival after reading some very negative reviews. However the check in went without a hitch and our room was pretty good. We knew that we wouldn't be in the hotel much as we were doing the Disney parks, Seaworld etc, so we were up and out early and back late. However, we experienced none of the problems highlighted in other reviews, i.e. musty smells, dodgy aircon etc. Yes the hotel could do with a face lift from the 70/80's into the 21st century decor wise; but that is all superficial. My one criticism would be the carpet in the room good have done with a good clean. That said, we never walk barefoot in hotels, as you don't know who was there before you; different people have very different standards. The bed (not a sleep number) was very comfortable; again a personal thing. The room was cleaned daily, towels replenished etc and there was no problems. I used the Pizza Hut downstairs once and my pizza was delicious. The hotel is quite large and spread over several buildings. It is set in landscaped grounds, which are very well kept. Some of the ponds have fish and turtles in them, and there are feed dispensers (10cents) so you can feed the fish etc. The inbound car park barrier (not a gate as some discribe) never worked whilst we were there, but it is there to control traffic and not people. The hotel is ideally situated just off the 192 and just down from the I4, so getting around, assuming you have a hire car, is a breeze; once you get your head around navigating amidst a plethora of advertising signs of all shapes and sizes. Sometimes, trying to find the road signs was a challenge - but it was the first time I had driven in the States. Eating out is easy with a huge selection of eateries catering for all tastes a short drive away, whilst some are within easy walking distance. In summary we found the hotel clean and comfortable for our needs. After a day in the parks we were shattered and didn't explore the hotel that much.

We had two bookings and unfortunately they couldn't put us in the same room for both reservations.

I was expecting a small trinket for my son, they brought up a toy, straight out of the Disney parks, with its $30 price tag still attached. My son was THRILLED with it. That was the first plus.

The hotel appears to be a nice place in a nice location, but we found the \"nice\" doesn't extend to the rooms themselves. The first thing we noticed was the smell. Closer inspection revealed a room that was in need of remodeling and updating. Oh, well! We are not picky people, and we told ourselves it was just for one night. We put our stuff in the room and headed out for an evening at Downtown Disney. After thinking of that smell all evening, I decided to ask for another room upon returning. The front desk staff were all very friendly and the change was made quickly - - to the room next door. I had hoped to be moved to another building, perhaps one that is newer and fresher, but that did not happen. We convinced ourselves that it was better, and just went to bed. We awoke early the next morning (not what we'd planned to do on the last day of vacation), and just wanted to leave. The whole experience - the smell, the running toilet, the question of cleanliness (I wore my sandals around the room) - did not lend itself to fond memories that we wanted to extend! My daughter woke up with a headache, which leaves me wondering just what exactly caused the smell. The one bright spot was the view out onto the pool area, which was very pretty from the fifth floor of the 6000 building. This, too, was tainted, though, when a small camera crew set up around the hot tub the next morning. As my daughter and I were preparing to leave, we saw as a beautiful young woman begin to pose on the rocks. Some may have found this to be an exciting bonus. I found it sad and shocking - especially when she took off her top! I am so thankful my teenage son was not with me! And, yes, this was in the public hot tub out in the pool area! The grounds are pretty, the staff helpful and nice, but I would not stay in the hotel again. There are too many choices in the Orlando/Kissimmee area - fresher, newer, nicer properties.

The parking was abysmal, especially in the north lot behind building 3000? due to the poor lighting, which is where you were forced to park if you returned late. And security, the lot's hard iron gate was locked after say 11, but the automatic arm gate didn't lower after 11 as I was told by the front desk, as other people attested to. The only saving grace is that the exterior doors were locked and needed your room card to get into.

Was scheduled for 5 days. I arrived and wanted a smoking room. The clerk had to check with her manager, who never appeared in person, three times during the entry process. First she checked and said there weren't any, that part of the hotel was being renovated. And the hotel was \"full.\" It was Priceine, they couldn't be full if I got a room. I said I'd take that area, she checked again and said the manager didn't want me there, it wouldn't be an \"enjoyable\" stay. Checked with her manager again, suggested they put me in a first floor room, near a door since there was a large penalty for people who smoke in non-smoking rooms. I wasn't pleased but content. IMPORTANT PART FOR NON-SMOKERS: The room reeked of smoke. Lamp shades had been replaced, but walls had tar and one burn, carpet had a couple burns. Immediately called the front desk and advised them it already smelled of smoke, had been smoked in, and I didn't want to be billed for what had already been done, offered to let them check to verify, but they chose not to. Parking lot view, but it was a cheap room and I had \"special needs\" like being near a door, so that wasn't unreasonable. It won't bother most, but for a smoker to be trapped in a smoky room with threat of fees if you smoke is torture. Returned and took a bath. Bath tub was incredibly shallow. While slid down in tub to get in the water, saw the inside of the sink under the rim was absolutely BLACK with mold. Checked a few more places, including AC unit, also moldy. Already knew I had to leave for one night that was already paid for, so did some priceline bidding for 4* this time, ended up at the Peabody, exactly what I was aiming for, near the convention center for $108/night (had to do valet parking which was $18/night) for two nights, while I continued to pay $100 nightly for the Radisson (this is the danger of Priceline and Hotwire, but I'll still use them, just do my research into previously won hotels and read the RECENT reviews, not just the overall rating). Packed up after one night at the Radisson for what was a two week vacation (I'm a woman, that's a lot of heavy clothes, shoes, and toileties), moved to the Peabody for two nights (absolutely fantastic). Gave the Radisson my complaints, told them it was so bad I was leaving for another hotel for three days, told them I wanted a smoking room in the under reservation section when I returned. The moved to the Peabody before spending a night at a Best Western elsewherefor swimming with manatees (highly recommend with a small group, if you don't harass them, and very educational). Returned for that last night at the Radisson (Peabody was booked with a convention). They'd gotten my complaints, put me in the section under \"renovation.\" It was significantly better. A nicer room (same shallow tub) without mold and gave me a Sleep Number bed which is supposed to be $10 extra. Although there were plants and art missing from the halls, the elevator was a bit inconventient and I ran into workman who were walking once, it was a much nicer experience. So they did resolve my issue for one night's stay The Radisson has a $12.50/night resort fee, which I just tell myself was an internet fee, in addition to the potential Sleep Number fee. I'm ok with the fees, although I wasn't warned about them. I was billed for the fees for the nights I wasn't there, too. I just paid them and was just grateful to be out. Even at full price, this wouldn't have been a ridiculously expensive room, but it isn't a 3 star. At best it's a 2.5, if you don't have a moldy room. The ponds were lovely, but how much time do you spend looking at ponds when in Orlando? The ponds also made it a further walk from parking, inconvenient with a heavy load. Check in was in a separate building, which wasn't convenient, but must allow extra room for ponds. So it's a 2.5 star hotel at a 3 star price.

Good location - we used the shuttle buses for most journeys to most of the parks - which were reliable and considering it was the main Easter holidays, only one bus was full. When this happened, the bus driver phoned for a (free) taxi for the family that were unable to get on the bus. The times of the shuttles are limited yes, but suited us okay as we had time to have a good look round the parks. We did hire a car for three days (through the hotel which were very helpful) but only because we were wanted to travel around a bit - I suppose it depends on your reason for travelling there - we wanted to go to all the disney parks, seaworld, busch gardens, universal etc, and we found it all fantastic!! Having a car obviously means you can be more flexible and i guess as we do not have children meant that we could stay out as long as we wished. We also went to have a dolphin swim at discovery cove which was truly a wonderful experience and a must if you are going to Orlando.

We couldn't believe this - we had the time of our lives and just goes to prove that some people find fault in everything!!!!! As the discovery cove is an 'all inclusive' day, you do have to wait a little for food at lunch time but they do have a maximum number of people.

The price was great, but obviously frequent visitors do not get any perks beyond that. The first room that I got smelled unbearably horrible and had a view of a vacant lot. When I went to the front desk for a new room, I wasn't too confident when I got a room in the same building directly above the first room. The new room smelled musty, but it was tolerable. It did, however, have the same view of the vacant lot. The entire building smelled musty and as we were checking out, staff members were shampooing the carpets. For the other reviewers who have complained about walking far to park, the problem is that the resort consists of several buildings. The buildings near the entrance have a very limited parking area, so unless you get back early, you have to park in the large parking lot in the rear of the property, which is fine if you are in the rear courtyard buildings. Be sure to get a courtyard view or pool view room to avoid the view of expansive vacant lot. When I first came to this resort about 12 years ago it was being renovated.

There is an abandoned bank next door, an abandoned apartment complex, and the aforementioned vacant lot. There is a security gate for the parking area that is used after dark. I am pretty sure that it has been the same code every time that I have been here, which is obvious from the 4 numbers on the keypad that are worn bare! The plusses: great price, close to Disney, nice pool, Pizza Hut in lobby is open late. Staying here is a gamble, it could be great or it could be bad, but I don't think that I will take the chance anymore.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Ga", "Title": "\u201cLooks can be deceiving\u201d", "Author": "travel_guru_atl", "ReviewID": "UR13184517", "Content": "I use Hotwire all the time for booking hotels. Normally when I pick a hotel I stay in a 3.5 or 4 star hotel, which ever has the better deal for my budget. I picked the 3.5 in Disney Main Gate on Hotwire and got the Radisson Celebration. Normally Hotwire ranks Radissons 3 star, so I was a little shocked to get it at the 3.5 star level. Immediately I went and looked at the website for hotel pictures, they were not terrible and the complex looked nice. We were pleased to see they had free Wi-Fi in select rooms and Sleep Number beds. I called the hotel to speak to the guest relations rep. to see if they had Disney tickets at the hotel, but the rep. wouldn't tell me the gimmick over the phone, just said to ask at check-in, the prices constantly change. So, we get to the hotel...and as we pull in, you see the front is nice looking. The lobby was decent...but then you are given directions to the building you are staying in...we were in building 4.....so, we had to drive around to the back side of the complex....you turn the corner from the front of the parking lot and its a total different picture. There are two 8 story towers and two 2 story buildings. We were in the backside of one of the 8 story towers, luckily it overlooked the pool. As you pull into the parking lot, you see condos at the far back of the lot...a run down playground which is just a small toddler single slide set in a sand box. So..we parked....and the parking was dark and surrounded by trees that every morning we'd come to the car to find a branch had fallen. There was no close parking to any of the building and lighting was terrible...completely unsafe for traveling with children. Asthetically it looked on on the outside. Then you walk into the building and you are hit with a musty carpet smell. You walk through the labryinth and find your right elevator and get to your floor. Apparently our floor didnt have hallway a/c because it was always hotter than a sauna on the floor. We get in our room...and it's just a standard room. 3.5 star on Hotwire is usually much much nicer. The bathroom was nice...marble looking everything. But I again, we were travelling with an 18 month old...so not the safest kind of flooring for her getting in and out of the tub. And the tub....I nearly slipped and fell and busted my butt getting in that itself. There is not skid prevention what so ever and it's an angled tub. We didnt get the sleep number room, that was $10 more/night. The regular bed was the hardest hotel bed Ive ever slept on. Ive stayed at Motel 6's that were more comfortable than this. Housekeeping knocks on your door at 9am....we're on vacation..we dont want to be hearing knocking on the door at 9am. There was supposed to be a security gate that you put a code in to get to the parking lot, but it never worked the whole time and was always up. At dusk you were supposed to have to swipe your room key to gain access to the building...never had to. Security was the absolute LAST thing this property was concerned about. Now there is a picture of a slide on the hotels website. After looking at the view from our room...luckily it was too cold for us to swim that weekend, but it would have been such a let down. It basically was a handicapped ramp with water to make you slide down it.....not even enough to call it a waterslide.....it was a total joke. Don't be fooled by the appearance on their website...this location is totally not worth the money they charge much less what we had to pay with Hotwire. We called and complained to Hotwire and got a $75 credit, our other option would be to pay the difference on a beter quality room. If I wasnt with a baby, I would have done it...but its just a PITA to move all that stuff across town. Next time I'll just go with the 4star and pay the price. Hotwire totally overrated this hotel. Normally I get Hilton's, Hyatt's and Embassy Suites for 3.5 star's...not a freaking Radisson. Thankfully we only paid $69/night or I would have complained up a storm. I don't recommend this property at the price they charge per night on their website...I've had better deals with better hotels.", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cOK option close to Disney\u201d", "Author": "Estells", "ReviewID": "UR13054461", "Content": "We stayed at the Radisson Celebration for 7 nights beginning January 19. We were using frequent flier miles to book the room and so did not expect the best room on property. Overall, the room was fine. It was clean and spacious enough for 3 of us - not like we spent much time in the room anyway. The bathroom was rather small and the water pressure in the shower was terrible. First night there, we had a major condensation leak from the A/C, but it was taken care of quickly. Food was fine in Mandolin's. We only ate breakfast there, but there were always plenty of choices and good options for us. The price for the breakfast - kid's eat free - was very reasonable for hotel buffets. They more than gouge you, however, at the lobby quick service restaurant. Regular coffee was $3.25! Not a latte - just coffee. The grounds were fine, but not as lush as they appear on the website. The pool with the water slide is not heated, so my son only made one trip down it before moving to the heated pool. Parking was supposed to be secure - they go to the point of giving you an entry code for the gate - but the gate was always up our entire stay. From what I see for other reviews, it has been that way for a while. When I mentioned it at the front desk, the girl said \"Yes, we know and it is being fixed.\" 5 days later, it was still broken. Overall, the location was great - 5 minutes to Disney max - and there are plenty of the typical restaurants close by if you don't want to dine at Disney every night. However, next visit we will likely stay on Disney property at a moderate resort and take advantage of the amenities that go with the Disney resorts. We never took the shuttle - very limited runs and we heard it was often full - so ended up driving to Disney every day.

We visited all the Disney parks, downtown Disney, Blizzard Beach and Seaworld. We have a 10, 9, and 6 year old. Overall, we were satisfied with the Radisson. We had gone to Orlando 3 years ago and paid a lot of money to stay on the Disney property as we wanted the entire Disney experience for a brief 4 day stay. As we had planned a week long vacation this year, I did a lot of research on various sites to find a hotel with the best value, but still having a good reputation and fun things to do on our days off from the parks. I chose the Radisson, even though I was scared about some very terrible reviews. I have never written a hotel review myself, but felt compelled to tell others about the (+) and (-)s of our recent stay. (+)s: beautiful landscaping, well-kept pools, friendly helpful staff (every one of them we came in contact with), Marceea (activities director) is a gem, the guy who does pool-side tattoos is very kind and generous (will re-do airbrushed tattos ($5) during your entire stay, for FREE), the magic show/magician is hilarious and very good (was my kids' favorite highlight of the trip (despite all the $$ shelled out at parks!!), sleep number beds and linen were very comfortable (-)s: hidden charges-Mandolins (restaurant at the hotel) markets kids under 10 eat free; a dinner buffet at $22 per adult bill came out to $79; when asked about this-it was broken down that all soft drinks, including the kids were charged and were high priced, we were charged tax on all the 3 'free' kid meals, and a manadatory 15% tip for all 5 buffet meals was added to bill; here's the kicker though~since we purchased the room option that included breakfast buffet for 2 adults, all of our breakfasts for all adults and the 3 kids were 'free' (including numerous juices, coffees, no extra tip added on) (?!?); the breakfast was good and I would recommend it; Other (-)s included the taxi service the Radisson uses was always $5-$7 more per trip than any taxi we used coming back from the parks for the same distance; Why taxis? The 'free shuttle' was often late due to the heavy holiday traffic (no one's fault), it was first come, first serve, so the line began early (so one often waited around 45 min or more for an unguaranteed seat as the shuttle also delivered people from 2 other hotels); this was one of the main factors in choosing the Radisson and we were willing to pay taxis vs. the hassle getting the shuttle; we were also concerned as everyone kept telling us the parks sometimes closed because of capacity around noon to non-Disney resort people, so this was an added stressor as a 5 min trip to a park sometimes took 1.5 hours start to finish on the shuttle My husband feels overall the Radisson was still a wise choice for a budgeted 1 week vacation, but I think if we do venture to Orlando again, I may lean towards a Disney value resort, to ease my mind of transportation issues, ensure park access and to take advantage of Extra Magic hours.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNeeds to be updated\u201d", "Author": "CtheGlobe77", "ReviewID": "UR11714772", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel in November 2007 for a business trip.

We had a much better breakfast at the IHOP a minute down the road on 192. The waiter poured another table coffee from container we were given. 2. The bathroom was extremely small. If opened, the door would clip the knees of someone if they were on the toilet (we didn't open the door when someone was on the toilet, just trying to give you the perspective of the size). In addition to being small, the bathroom looked like it was half remodeled. The sink was tan granite, the floor a complimentary brown granite, and the shower a grey and white marble with rust spots. It looks like they forgot to redo the shower! Also the chain in the toilet fell off a few times- no wonder because when you opened the back tank of the toilet the insides were rusted. 3. We requested fresh towels etc. throughout our stay, but it seemed that the quantity of face clothes dwindled each day, until we just didn't receive any. Also, half way through they gave us a hand towel instead of a bath mat. Complimentary toiletries were also not replenished (at all). I recently stayd in Boston at the Radisson, and these thing were attended to properly. 4. The pool, although the water was clean, looked tired and like it needed a good scrubbing. The drains and walls were discolored with a green tint (algae?) 5. There was some trash in the bushes behind the lounge chair seating next to the pool. 6.

Next time around, I would probably stay elsewhere for a cheaper price considering we spent little more than sleeping hours in the hotel and didn't make proper use of the facilities provided.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "derby, uk", "Title": "\u201cUnderrated\u201d", "Author": "markhels", "ReviewID": "UR8829105", "Content": "Just feel that we have to add our review of the radisson resort orlando celebration.

Fridge in rooms. Bad Points 70s concrete style. Rooms are old, but clean and d\u00e9cor is ok. Air con, whilst effective, is individual to room and therefore noisy. Our opinion. The value cannot be beaten. For the price of some motels you are close to disney, on the 192, with all the benefits and features of a major hotel. For families, it would be possible to get all of you in a twin, but for the price, get 2 rooms if you have teenagers and enjoy some peace... This is a resort and hence usually has families here.

The check in was very fast and easy, probably was my fastest check in ever. I was first sent to a room in the 1000 building. My room was facing the side of the pool, but only one problem, didnt see the the pool. Only saw trees. But anyway the room's safe wasnt working properly and they changed my room. The second room we went to was in the 6000 building. At first entrance to the room, we almost died of the smell, including the bellboy. I called the front desk to change to another room, and it seemed like they were annoyed with me for wanting to change to another room. But they did it anyway, and the third room was fine. The room itself was nice, it was cleaned very nice everyday. We had a mini refrigerator, so we bought some sodas and water and stored it there. The pools were very nice, especially the smaller pool, which was heated, and was very relaxing at night. The big pool was very nice too. It had a slide, but let me warn you adults, its good only for the kids to slide down on, because adults always got stuck. Now let me get to the bad parts. Remember, we were there labor day weekend. Parking at the hotel next to your room was almost impossible to find. I would have to park all the way on the other side of the hotel and then had to walk for 5-7 minutes to my room. The staff at the hotel is not great either. As I told you before, I had to change my room twice and was given a slight attitude after the second room change. Also, after check out we were in the airport when my wife noticed she left a bag with 3 sweaters inside in the hotel room. I called the hotel right away and was told they would check and call me back. That never happend. I left them 3 messages to call back and still no call back. I eventually just gave up, thinking even if they would find them, they wouldn't send them to me anyway. Overall this hotel isn't really that bad. Especially since you don't really spend much time in the hotel since you are in the parks all day. And the attitude of the staff, I guess you just have to deal with, since you dont talk to them all day anway. Personally I would recommend this hotel to someone, but because there are so many hotels in orlando, I would go somewhere else next time. THIS ISNT A HOTEL TO BE AFRAID OF.

They had a game room, which we enjoyed. Didn't take the shuttle for we had rented a van right from the lobby, which was very convenient. Gift store was not overly priced just like any other gift store. They had something going on in the hotel lobby almost every night, which was really nice. I received a nice massage while I was there got my grandbaby portrait painted in the lobby by the artist who was there every night. We enjoyed tennis playing ping-pong.

But something was always just a little off...an ashtray by the pool that was too full, the smell of cigarette smoke in the hallway, elevators that worked right every other time. We chose this hotel because it was close to Disney but just a little less expensive than one of their mid-range hotels. If you are going to spend over $150 on a hotel room, you might as well stay at Disney, where you know that everything is always going to be perfect. Even if it's a lower-tier Disney resort, the attention to detail is always going to be above-par, and that means everything when you are on vacation. It's not included in your hotel rate, but the breakfasts were truly outstanding. There was a gentleman making omelets, and I'm not lying when I say my husband and I both had two each...every day we were there.

The shop which sold breakfast croissants etc was really convenient if you don't want a full breakfast but jsut a quick snack before you head out. Also, having the pizza hut outlet was really useful as well when you feel peckish in the day. We only ate in the restaurant a couple of times. The breakfast was good but I think you can get better deals outside. It gets extremely busy at breakfast times as well. The pool bar had great snacks too - which is always handy, especially with kids. There baby pool wasn't that warm as it was meant to be, but was much better than some of the other pools. The main pool has a slide - which was really good - even all the adults were going on there! There are secret little hot spa/tubs dotted around the resort. You just walk around near the pools, and you'll be surprised to find a little hot spa which you can jump into. The location of the hotel was ideal - close to Disney, and close to restaurants and shops as well without being in the midst of them all as the hotel is located just off the main road (near Arabian nights). I think the best thing about the hotel was the convenience of the hotels shop - where you can buy hot food and coffee to take to your room and the pools - there was a few to choose from which was good. The resort is quite big and its good to have different entrances to get into your own block.

A coffee maker in the room only brews 4 cups and we bought our own coffee and filters even though they supplied it daily. I just like my own!!! We also had a pool view which was beautiful! Hotel grounds are fabulous! The pools are their finest amenity!! One really big pool with a slide and a waterfall which is not heated, but it was nice in the ninety degree weather! A smaller pool is heated and that one was nice all the time! There is also kid's activities there daily. The waterslide was down for repair when we got there, so they had a movie at the heated pool every night for the kids! Plus, they put up a huge blown up slide for the kids to go down instead. There is 2 hot tubs which were fabulous! I found the grounds and pool areas clean and spacious! Lots of pool loungers for everyone! Service was fine. We only had one problem when I pushed a button on the safe and we couldn't get it to reset. Security was there quickly to remedy the problem. Plus, housekeeping was there every day with new towels and they cleaned the bathroom and made the beds. My only problem is that they did not vacuum. I would have liked that!! Did not eat at Mandolin's, but did get Starbucks coffee a lot and so good! Their onsite Pizza Hut Express was cool to have too!! A plaza right across the street had a little supermarket, but it was pricey. We bought a lot at Walmart or Publix. I do recommend a car here only because we like going to different places to eat and there is not much within walking distance. Did not use the shuttle service as we had our own car. Also, there is a service charge tacked on to everything you get by the pools. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers and it was $22, but they were huge and very good, but quite pricey. I sort of expected that, though. There is also a computer room in the lobby with free internet access. I checked my emails and that was convenient. Checkout was a breeze as we called in the night before and they slipped a charge sheet under our door in the morning and we never had to go to the front desk to check out unless we had a problem with our charges and we didn't. There is an $11.30 a day resort fee, but I think this is normal in Orlando for some reason. I just wish they would put it into the room rate. Very close to Disney Parks.

They honored their online price guarantee and we ended up with a price of $62 (plus tax & resort fees)-to around $75/night. Not bad considering the close proximity to the parks.

The regular price on the buffet was $13/pp. The online service desk assured me that they had updated their records to include the revised per night fee and included the freebies.

The carpet and interior did look worn (past its prime) considering that they just remodeled. However, the lobby and restaurants were very nice. The pools were very nice too. Beware: They charge a 15% service charge on all meals, and beverages ordered at their restaurants, bar, take out and room delivery. Tip is of course, extra. They offer discount tickets to the parks, which is definately worth while (we spent appox. $210/for 7 days of Disney parks).

The pools were excellent with a small heated pool and a large unheated pool that was superb for cooling down and relaxing in the hot sunshine, there was also a good sized children\u2019s pool and two red hot spa pools. To further show the friendliness of the resort, the staff take a projector down to the heated pool at night and play movies on a large screen so you can swim and watch a film while enjoying a drink from the pool bar (called dive in movies). We used the Deli bar on several occasions and the pizzas, burgers and chicken were all good and fairly priced and the staff were very friendly with the manager (I assume) being very and chatty.

While it's a good price for the location and amenities, there are major problems with reservations/billing! The first time we stayed there, they ran out of non-smoking rooms, and had to give us a smoking room. It smelled awful and my husband has allergies! At least back then, they comped us that one night, and put us into non-smoking the next night. This last stay, however, we were arriving late into Orlando, so I called ahead to confirm that they had our room and weren't going to give it away. We arrived around close to midnight, and guess what? They'd given our room away!! With a tired and grumpy 5 year old child wanting to just go to bed, the Radisson staff told us they had booked us at the Rosen Shingle Creek, 7 miles away! But that they would comp us that night. So we stayed at the Rosen, who said they needed our credit card just to have on file and that the Radisson would pay. Well, we checked our credit card statement and sure enough, we'd been charged $186 for staying at the Rosen. We went back to the Radisson the next night to continue our booked stay, and reminded them to pay for the Rosen. They acted like they knew nothing, and it took much aggravation to get the point across of their mistakes. They were very uncaring and unprofessional. They gave us a letter saying they were responsible for the charges at the Rosen, but we still have not gotten a credit to our account and I'm still working on getting our money back. We should not be responsible for having all this aggravation over their mistakes. But I feel like it will be like pulling teeth over the next few weeks trying to get this resolved. So I guess my point is, if you plan on arriving late to this hotel, just know that your room may be given away, and just say NO to any other hotel they want to send you to! I would have rather just gone to the Quality Inn which was advertising vacancy, instead of being sent to a 5 star, overpriced hotel, which the Rosen Shingle is, and then getting totally cheated out of money I could have spent somewhere else. The front desk staff at the Radisson are very unprofessional, so just be prepared to deal with that if any problems come up. We will NEVER stay there again. I would recommend staying at Lowes hotel near Universal, as they are professional and accomodating.

It *is* truly very very close to Disneyworld and to Universal, but because Orlando's every road is under construction all the time, you really have to know your way around and have a map handy so that you can drive easily. Getting home will be different than coming there, in fact, our instructions for how to get to the hotel involved making a U-turn in between the white concrete things that partition the road (which wasn't the freeway but some sort of 'parkway') in the dirt with zooming traffic coming at us head-on in the midst of a steep curve. The hotel did have swimming for the kids, but the pool was murky and all three kids got rashes on their body.They said the pool slide was at least 40 feet when it was more like 40 inches. They said the water smelled like urine. For sure, we did see babies in the pool with diapers on even though I think there was a smaller pool that they should have used. It was pretty bad. The parking was nearly impossible to get into. We had to drive around four or five buildings, or come through a secret back entrance, all of which had a keypad that we were required to know a special code for. One guy forgot his and stopped up the whole line while he tried to figure it out. I think someone just finally told him what it was. There was not room enough to park near your building, and other buildings' visitors would park near our building. At one point I had to park near the lobby and took one of the limo's places because there literally were zero spaces for me anywhere in the whole lot. The outdoor fun, including bar and big screen tv closes at 10 or 10:30, not what you'd expect for people on vacation trying to have a good time. We had no minibar in the room, which is fine, but we thought there was a mini-kitchen and there was not. Small fridge that froze everything, so we lost $50 of lobster pasta we brough back to the room from a nearby restaurant. There was 1 (one) microwave in the entire hotel, which consists of about five, 5-story buildings whose hallways meet in the middle, sort of like a star. That's a lot of people to have no microwave power. We never could get the safe to open. The buildings' exterior doors would lock you out, requiring key to get in, so if you ran to the car without it, you might sit there for a while before someone noticed you. There was no intercom to alleviate this situation. The outdoors had a long long walkway that you could bypass by going through a cigarette infested dirt path made by oh-so-many before you, and I personally did not like the concrete stairway where people would lurk while smoking where you had to slide your key. The deli there was incredibly expensive, and I spent $60 on a quick breakfast and lunch there one day. It has a Pizza Hut inside it, but then again that was expensive, charging $25 or more for a medium pizza. The \"Kids eat free\" program is a joke. If you want to go to a deserted restaurant on the premises that charges more than double what a normal place would charge, then you can see why a child might eat for free. If you won the lottery you still wouldn't go there... only 8 or 10 items on the menu, and it was NOT that nice of a place either. The one great thing about this place is that it is so close to the amusement/theme parks, and it's close to gas station and walgreens. There was an odd lack of take-out / normal restaurants there, as though you were stranded in some far-away city without a modern-day restaurant row. The room was redone with down pillows and comforters, too, which was heavenly, and the hallways were painted and carpeted very attractively. The staff was quite friendly and helpful, although they spoke no English (which doesn't bother me). Everything in the rooms seemed clean and they had good speed internet. The tv of course had 5 channels, all of which were aimed at getting you to buy something or to advertise Orlando. Their deals on tickets were the worst, asking considerably more money for one-day passes to one park only. With the rain coming and going, we needed better than that, and we got lucky by buying tickets from the parks themselves. The best ticket deal is from the Sea World site, which has links for tickets that allow you to come and go at your choice of many different parks for your choice of days (1-14, I believe). All in all I'd probably stay there again if I did not plan to swim, watch tv, enjoy any type of nightlife or eat close-by, but wanted to be close to the parks at a place I'm familiar with. In reality, I know if I go back to Orlando, I'll be looking forward to better accommodations elsewhere. ~KK~", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBestest Foreverest\u201d", "Author": "trojanette07", "ReviewID": "UR6902840", "Content": "This review is a little late in coming, but we want to give credit where it is due. My girlfriend and I traveled to Florida for a birthday rendezvous and a bit of Disneyworld and Universal. Reasons for recommendation: (1) Hotel room was very clean. The rooms are separated into various buildings, and I believe we were in complex 3. Lots of towels in the bathroom. TV worked great. (2) Shuttle Service was amazing. The driver was hilarious, knew everything about the area. He gave tips about what to do, where to eat. Shuttles went to all locations, so you don't need a car if you're on a budget, which we were. Definitely made our trip much more enjoyable. Shuttles started early and picked you up really late at the parks, so you can stay a bit later if you wanted to. (3) Breakfast buffet was awesome. Made-to-order omelettes, there was bacon, eggs, and even donuts. For, you know... people who want to eat donuts in the morning. (4) Front desk service was great, even at 4am when we were checking out to catch a flight. Checkin and checkout were painless. Not-so-good stuff: (1) Pool was closed at the time. It was winter and really damn cold and rainy part of the time. So not a big deal and I'd bet its open by now. (2) Room service didn't arrive for a long time, so that was a minor issue. But when we called to ask why what took so long, they gave us a discount. Coool. Finally, in conclusion, summarizing: Great hotel, would stay at again, would recommend to everyone.

This is not, however, a \"resort\", rather a very large hotel on beautifully landscaped grounds off of I-4. Resort to me means sauna, massages, salon, etc. and to be waiting on hand and foot. We got a room in the \"6000\" building and had sleep number beds. Very pleasant night's sleep. Quality of linens was lovely. Air conditioning and heat worked great. The bathroom was perfectly fine and the housekeeping were excellent. Water pressure and temperature were always consistent. Decor was nicely appointed. Bathrooms a bit small but not a big deal unless you are really obese and with an obese partner trying to brush your teeth at the same time. There is a free large bus that will take you to all the Walt Disney locations (at set schedules), Universal Studios and SeaWorld. You are within easy walking distance to a strip mall that has a Kobe Japanese steakhouse. Regarding front desk staff....very, very helpful, as was the bellman. Room service, though prompt, mixed up my order one night and then came back with the original plate of spaghetti I ordered. (I received someone else's fruit plate....maybe they were trying to tell me something.) When they came back with the spaghetti, it was cold. Not good.

The rest of the breakfast buffet was not so good but my husband had no complaint. The wait staff were obviously taxed and service was slow. I couldn't blame them....I would have flipped out.

We stayed in building 6000, which must have been recently renovated because our room was immaculate, new carpeting, marble bathroom (small, but clean) and a sleep number bed. We had a really nice view of the pool too. There is one thing to be aware of and that is that they have cards in the bathroom and near the bed that tell you if you want clean sheets every day, to put the card on the pillow/bed and throw the towels in the bathtub if you want clean towels. We abided by this request and had NO problem getting clean sheets and towels restocked every day. Since we were barely at the hotel and really wanted a quiet place to sleep, we found it to be very sufficient for our needs. The jacuzzi was great. We rented a car and found the hotel property to be very convenient and close to all the theme parks & entertainment. The deli area can be pricey, so you are better off going to the nearest Walgreens for juice and snacks. We ordered pizza from Pizza Hut that is in the hotel and it was delivered quickly to our room, hot and fresh. The information desk staff was very helpful and the business center provided internet service when we needed to use it.

The carpet was filthy,the room smelled musty and it would be impossible for us to sleep five in there.

The room smelled terribly musty, the carpets were filthy and the only chair was stained with something . I went back down to the desk and once again she apologized and gave me another key to another room. The third room smelled worse and since we didn't want to spend our first day on vacation playing musical rooms we settled on the second room with the stipulation that someone deodorize the room, remove the filthy chair and vacuum up the cheerios left on the floor after the chair was moved to make room for the fold out bed. Well after all the negotiation the chair wasn't removed, the cheerios never vacuumed,but we did recieve two squirts of an air freshener. The rest of the stay we deodorized with my perfume. Several of our nights were also cut short due to the shuttle bus early pickup. When I booked the room I was guaranteed a bus available after the parks closing, and that wasn't the case. When I notified the manager she acted completely unconcerned. I was very disappointed with my accomodations and the attitudes of most of the people working here.

The landscaping is fantastic and it looks like a resort. The pool is beautiful, the hot tub is amazing and the rooms are really nice. First impressions are that this has got to be a 5 star hotel, not a 3.5 star. Our Experience: When we got to the hotel, we found out that they had no smoking rooms, but they would let us convert the 2 non-smoking rooms into smoking rooms for our stay. We thought, ok, that's a little ridiculous not to have 2 smoking rooms and they should have called to let us know, but oh well. Well turns out they put us right next to the area they're doing construction on and woke all 4 of us up at 7 am the next morning! We went to the desk in the morning to complain about the construction so they apologized and said they'd move us to ground floor rooms with patio doors so we could go outside to smoke. They told us to just have our bags packed and ready to go and someone will come by to take them to our rooms while we were out. We left the hotel at about 11am and didn't return until 6pm. We asked for our new room keys and they hadn't moved any of our stuff yet. We thought, oh great. So we went to get our stuff and move to our new rooms ready to see the sliding doors to the patios. Turns out, there are no sliding doors. None of the windows open and the entire hotel has no balconies. We went back to the desk to say we didn't get what you promised us, and all they could say was oh sorry, there's nothing else we can do for you. Not once ever did they offer to refund us a couple nights or anything, instead, they said they would refund us our service charges at $10/day. We said, what service charges? Well apparently this hotel charges you to use their internet, pool, hot tubs etc at $10/day. 6 months ago this wasn't mentioned online in the booking section, they just changed it but were still charging us the money. By this time the only thing we wanted to do was leave. To make things even better, the room got so damp and started to stink. You had to have the fan on with the heat all the time or else your bed would get wet. We think this is because the air circulation was the pits and the fact that none of the windows opened! My mom then needed to have some dry cleaning done, so she called down to have it picked up to be done to be ready to go the next day. The next day it hadn't been returned to the room and we found out that it was never even done! Apparently they had no idea that we needed it done even though it was sitting in the back waiting to be sent off.

The swimming pool is not clean: lots of white debris in it, and mating flies everywhere, to the point you don't really want to sit by the pool. (Incidentally I did not get this problem at other places, perhaps the overzealous use of fertilizer?) Room smelt a bit, but it was not the worse hotel room I've stayed in. The hotel actually feels a bit remote in terms of attractions, if you are going to rely on public transport. There is a bus stop outside (which I found out on leaving) but not the ideal set up for a newly arrived tourist. I would not stay here again just based on this factor alone: pick somewhere on International Drive or along the iRide trolley route (there is a website, use it for planning).", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cYuck!

After reading a few bad reviews we were a little bit concerned but on our arrival our concerns were swept away. The hotel is beautiful, the photos on the website do not do it justice. The staff on Reception were very friendly and efficient and we were checked in very quickly on our arrival. The room was clean and had been renovated recently so the decor and furniture was almost brand new. We had a bed and breakfast package and had breakfast in Mandolins restaurant every morning. Try the freshly made waffles - wonderful! Only two things let the hotel down in my opinion: 1. The shuttle bus. We could not understand why there was not a shuttle bus to Downtown Disney which is the nearest \"park\" to the hotel. We had to get the shuttle bus to Magic Kingdom and then get the monarail to a Disney resort and then catch a bus from the Disney resort to Downtown Disney. It would have been a lot easier to get a taxi but we didn't realise that at the time. Also, I think there should be more pick up shuttle buses from Sea World and Universal Studios. The bus picks you up from Sea World at 6.45pm but the park closes at 6.00pm. There is a later pick up at 9.20pm which we couldn't understand. What were people expected to do for nearly three hours if you missed the one at 6.45pm? 2. Guest Relations. The people at the guest relations desk were very rude and unhelpful unless you were buying tickets etc from them. I asked them a couple of questions on separate days and was answered in a very abrupt manner. One time they didn't even hang up the phone (they were on a personal phone call) to talk to me - just covered up the mouth piece and then started speaking in the phone again half way through answering me. Hints: I don't think it says on the hotel's website but there is a shuttle bus provided by Lake Buena Vista Shopping Outlet which picks you up at the hotel to take you shopping which is very good. The hotel is also near two great restaurants - Charley's Steakhouse and Ocean 11 seafood restaurant. Both are very good and are in walking distance of the hotel. There is also a Nike factory outlet just past these restaurants (also in walking distance) which is worth checking out. We would definitely stay at this hotel again without question.

But at check-in, the clerk told me about the $10 a day extra fee, which i was already aware of. I cant for the life of me understand why they just dont raise their rates instead of charging this extra mandatory fee. I reserved a courtyard view but instead got a pool view, this was sort of bitter sweet because the noise level of the pool was enough to keep you awake, especially since the pool obviously doesnt have any hours and can be used 24/7. But, if I were to choose a courtyard view I would be subject to even louder construction noises from the total renovations going on in the next building. Because of these renovations there was styrofoam pellets everywhere....and I literally mean EVERYWHERE! Styrofoam in the ponds, the pool, the walkways, the bushes, at least they swept the styrofoam up in the lobby and hallways, but it looked like someone sprinkled Ice Melt everywhere outside. They had maintenace using vaccuums to clean them up but there was so much there would just be more the next day anyway. OK, so of course no ice machine worked except for the one in the lobby, and they made no attempt to fix any of them. Now the big problem, the elevator didnt work. It worked the first day we were there and then not again. They stuck a sign on the door that said use the elevator in a different building. They had a repair company out to fix it, but within hours it was broke again, and noone came back to fix it. Maybe I was lucky to have quiet guests on each side of my room, but the hallways were loud enough to keep you awake. Doors constantly opening and slamming shut, guests would have hoards of kids screaming at midnight in the hallways as they returned from their day. No, this isnt the hotels fault, but I think next time I will choose a hotel with no enclosed hallways because of this. The last rant I have is about checking out. They slid a bill in my door jamb and it read $150 more than my reservation. I was shocked. So at the desk they said that it is their computer system and it happens to nearly everyone. Basically instead of $59 a night rate, I was charged $90 a night, plus and extra $20 service fee on top of the $50 service fee. They fixed it and we were on our way. Im just wondering how many people that might have affected in the past. Now, I will say hotel staff was real friendly, the maids were good at their job, and the pool area has beautiful landscaping work. The kiddy pool gets dirty fast because of a tree hanging right over it, so I wish they took time to clean it more often. If your the type of person that enjoys sitting outside and having a few drinks, then this place has the atmosphere you want. We read previous reviews so the hotel resteraunts were out of the question, so i cant tell you anything about them. Lastly, they have internet and a printer in an office you can use to print boarding passes for your flight home. This is handy because the orlando intl. airport was busy.

Upon checking in to our room, I noticed ants all along the window (we were on the 1st floor). I called the front desk and asked to be switched to a room on an upper level, because we would be keeping food in the room and didn't want to have the ants get at it.

I called housekeeping and they fixed the problems while we were out at dinner. Beds that night were fairly comfy, if small (only doubles - no queens). They had down-like coverlets and nice padding on the mattress. Sheets, however, were standard issue scratchy. I guess they don't use fabric softener.

Finally, I arrived at the door and found out that the slot for the key did not work. Luckily, a couple was coming out of the door when we were going in so we were able to get into the building. They informed us that they had notified the front desk about the door and it had not been repaired yet. Upon walking into the building, all I smelled was mildew and mold as if they had been hit by one of the hurricanes. I asked several of the workers and found out that they had not but still this constant mildew smell. The room was average with two beds and bathroom but I had not expected too much since I would be spending all of my time at Disney. When we went out to dinner we came back to the resort and realized that front desk had not given me a code to open the gate. Luckily again, one of the workers were nearby and lifted the gate for us...We walked a mile to reach the door again and found out that the door was still broken.

We were right! This place is big! There are 5 or 6 buildings, some 2-4 stories, some 6-8 stories, all surrounding a central pool/tiki bar area. The waterfall pool is HUGE, and has a waterslide. The first day we were there we swam in it and it was frigid! I guess it's not artificially heated, but after avoiding that pool for 2 days we got in it again and it was perfect and refreshing. We theorize that 2 days of temps in the upper 90's and abundant sunshine helped warm that water up a bit. The other pool is smaller, but heated. The only complaint we had was that in both pools, the water was very salty tasting (not that we drank the water but when it's on your lips you can't help but taste the saltiness). There were plenty of deck chairs, and towels were provided. THere were also two hot tubs. One had a waterfall and the temp in there was great. The other one was REALLY hot and we had to get out after a couple minutes it was so hot. There are lots of palm trees and plants, beautifully maintained. THe grounds in general were beautifully maintained. The parking lot was close to our building. It was a bit of a walk to the actual building but the walkway is covered from the edge of the parking lot all the way to the door, and you get to walk across a lovely pond with a fountain in it. You're in Florida for cripes sakes, so I don't know why other travelers found it necessary to complain about this short distance to the building. Yes, the parking lot is gated but only after dusk and even then all you have to do is punch in the code provided and drive around to your building. NOT a big deal! I believe that the hotel has just been renovated within the last year or so, so all the furnishings are brand new, new carpet, wallpaper, etc. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful too. We never did eat at the restaurant, so we can't say anything there. We were able to connect to free wireless internet with our Ipaq pocket PC, so I would imagine if you know how to work a laptop's wireless internet you'd have some luck connecting. If you don't have a laptop, there is a business center where you can access the internet for free and print for free. The one downside to the location of the property is that Kissimee/Celebration is dotted with abandonded properties like hotels or small amusment park type of places. There was an abandoned hotel right next to the Radisson but you could only see it as you drove down Parkway towards the Radisson and you couldn't see much of it at all. The upside to the location is it's proximity to restaurants, shopping, I-4, and DIsney. We were about 10 minutes from the Downtown Disney area and TYphoon Lagoon waterpark and once you figure out the screwy Disney/Florida road signage, you're good to go. This hotel also had a fitness center, brand spanking new! There were 2 recumbent bikes, a couple of different weight machines that you could adjust to do different exercises on, a couple of benches and a limited selection of dumbbells. It also had 2 treadmills and 2 elliptical machines. I only ended up using it a couple of times because I got so much exercise at Typhoon Lagoon and Disney but I was very happy with how nice it was and how much I was able to do in there. Fitness buffs will be happy with this gym. Or you can do what I did and walk 5 miles all around waterparks and upupup stairs on water rides and such, and come home 5 pounds lighter.

I thought the fact that the hotel was \"1-1/2 miles from the Main Gate\" meant that we could possibly walk if we missed the shuttle. I don't know how they measure their miles in Florida, but it was at least a 15 - 20 minute bus ride on the interstate and through construction--that is, when the bus doesn't break down! Our bus broke down one morning going to the Ticket and Transportation Center and there were many Disney buses that passed us up--because we were not with a Disney resort! The \"kids eat free\" plan is a joke. The restaurant is so expensive that of course kids can eat free when ordering from a very small selection. Oh, and if you want the 10% discount on food and beverage that is advertised on the internet, you need to tell the front desk about it when you register. Otherwise, you will have to deal with unprofessional people at the front desk who are definitely in need of customer service training. If it weren't for the very nice man at the restaurant, I would probably still be waiting to get my discount. The one thing that was positive about this hotel is that the bed was very comfortable.

We wouldn't have minded if this was said nicely but he stated that our reservation would have to be canceled and we would have to book a room with a view and pay the rack rate for it. I've never had anyone at a hotel give me that response. They claim the hotel is secure but the gates are not always down at night. We got in a few nights around midnight and they were up! When it was down, our pass code didn't work and we had to keep calling the front desk to open it for us. Plus, you can get on the hotel property by just walking on. The gates (when they are down) only prevent a vehicle from getting into their lots. I had to call three times one day in order to get more towels delivered to our room. Apparently they thought two towels were enough for three people. What really bothered me about this stay and why I will never go back is that my itemized bill was not placed under my door. Since I travel frequently for work, I always like to ensure that it's provided to me prior to leaving. When I checked in I was told that the itemized bill would be placed under my door the night prior to my departure. The morning of my departure it wasn't there. After I placed a call to the front desk, (after holding for 15 minutes) they said they probably placed it under the wrong door but that I could go to the front desk to pick it up bc they were to busy since there was a long line to check-in. I asked the woman I spoke to if I could just ask someone for the envelope with my bill in it rather than having to wait in the line since she stated she was printing it out for me and she said of course. When I got there, it was a different story. I was told I had to wait in line even though the envelope was within my line of vision. I asked the guest who was checking in if he minded me just picking up an envelope. He had no problem with it but then the man at the front desk told me I had to wait in line. When I explained my prior call, he said it didn't matter and that I had to wait. Mind you this was the hotels mistake and there were over a dozen people waiting to check in and I needed to catch my flight. I have never experienced such poor customer service. This is not to say that you will not have a good time here but just don't rely on the hotel to help you with anything including tickets as they try to get you to go on a timeshare presentation to get a free one day ticket to disney rather than just sell you the ticket.

My room was on the 7th floor of building 4 (room was 4xxx). The pictures of this resort on the website are stunning. Let me tell you, that beautiful 'lake' with the huge fountain overlooking the 'resort' does exist in real life, but it doesn't look nearly that impressive. They Photoshopped the heck out of that shot to make it look that nice. That aside, the room was comfortable. Nothing special, but not bad. Beyond here are some warnings: 1) The property and buildings are NOT secure at all. You will be given a 'gate code' to the parking area if you return to the resort late, but the gate is actually open 24/7. Furthermore, although there are key scanners outside every entrance to the building, they are not active; all the doors are unlocked. 2) If you need to print your boarding pass in their Business Center, be prepared to wait - not becuase of crowds - but because their Internet connection is painfully slow. Printing my Southwest Boarding Pass is a 3 minute task at home; it took 30 minutes here. The good news was the whole operation was free. By the way, there is NO assistance for the Business center at all; you better come prepared. 3) Each building has a few coin-op washer-dryers. They are located on random floors (not every floor). You need to call the front desk to find out where they are. Two of the three units in my building didn't work at all. One ate my coins then jammed. They were still broken at the end of my stay. My building had 8 floors, and three units. Most of the other buildings are only a few floors, so they may have only one unit. Be prepared to lug around armfuls of dirty laundry if yours isn't working. Also, make sure you have change; the only dollar changer on the property is in the Arcade. 4) Air conditioning was the ground-unit-near-the-window type. It freezes anyone in a 6 foot radius, but doesn't condition the entire room. 5) They claim they are located 1 1/2 miles from WDW and MGM Studios. If you (like me) are not Orlando savvy, you need to understand that WDW is freaking HUGE. They are not referring to the park, but rather distance to the resort area (which apparently is about the size of a New England state). Assuming you take the shortest freeway route with no traffic, it will take you at least 10-15 minutes to get to ANY Disney park. This complaint really isn't the fault of Radisson; all of the resorts do that. Actual time to Universal Studios is about 25 minutes with no traffic. Sea World about 15 minutes. If I had to guess the hotel chain based on my stay, I would have guessed along the lines of Howard Johnson - not Radisson. I will definitely stay somewhere nice next time.

The wedding day was out of this world and with photographs taken from around the paradise type resort including by the waterfall pool and gardens they are the envy of everyone. I cannot imagine a better day!!! The hotel itself was very clean and tidy and the bedding and towels were changed most days. There was a disabled guest in my party so we had already requested ground floor accomodation. When we arrived our rooms were spread out over the fourth and fifth floors which I was not happy about. Also one of lifts was broken for the first few days of our stay. So with disabled and young guests in pushchairs this caused real problems. However once I explained this, ground floor rooms were provided all next to one other for all of us that wanted to change rooms within 24hrs of us being in the hotel. And the porters even helped us to move between the rooms. The deli restaurant was very reasonably priced and provided great snacks at night whilst drinking in the bar. The pools were fabulous and stayed open late enough so that we could go in them after we returned from a day at the theme parks. And the heated smaller pool was lovely to relax in at all times day and night, although it did attract lots of children until about 10pm.

Great Resort!\u201d", "Author": "intromaster", "ReviewID": "UR3811519", "Content": "This hotel was absolutely wonderful. It is very well kept. The grounds are beautiful and the lobby along with the entire resort is extremely clean. Check-in was a breeze since I had made reservations thru the Internet a week before. Within five minutes I was handed my room access card along with a small layout of the resort to navigare my way around. My room was located in building 4000 on the 6th floor. I had a very nice room which consisted of two queen sized beds that I specifically requested. The room was immaculate with no stains, carpet burns or other marks. The a/c worked great but seemed to get cold pretty fast so I had to keep turning it off and on at times. The Business Center was open 24 hours a day which was great if you needed to access the Internet. However, it only had two computers so that meant you would probably have to wait at times like I did in order to use it. I only had to wait about 15-18 minutes max. and this was mostly during the morning. This was not a problem for me though. The food at Mandolins was superb!! I had the bbq ribs and french fries both times and it seemed even better the second time around. The breakfast buffet was good as well but the menu was the same everyday which does get boring after awhile. Bacon, eggs, hash browns, omlettes, french toast, sausages, biscuits w/gravy, cereal, fruits, milk, coffeee, tea, orange juice, apple juice, soda. The pool at this resort was really something. It had a cascading waterfall that was spectacular at night. The lights in the pool made it light up very nicely. Off to the side was a very large heated jacuzzi. It could fit 10-12 people easily!! The water was very warm. However, after 20-30 minutes I had to get out because I was sweating like crazy. The game room/arcade was very small and only had about five games. MsPacman/Galaga, a two player driving type game, table hockey, missle submarine type game and the game where you use a joystick to lower the claw and move around to grab a prize in the glass cage. The game room also had a change machine. The fitness room was nice too. I think it had about 8-10 machines. It had two state of the art treadmills but I dont remember exactly what other type of equipment was there. A very large plasma television sits right above the treadmills which you can use w/o a problem. I think it's open 24 hours a day since I was using it very late (after 12am) There is a deli/food place right in the lobby opposite the hotel front desk. It's open until 11PM. It has a very nice selection of menu items. Pizza, cheeseburger, fries, donuts, ice cream, soda, milk and a host of other snacks too numerous to mention here. Prices are very reasonable too. It was only $6.95 + tax for a delicious cheeseburger and fries. Recommended! I didnt take the shuttle to the parks since I rented a car so I cannot comment on this. There is a Thrifty car rental desk also in the hotel lobby. Also, another desk sells attraction tickets to the Disney parks, Universal, Seaworld, etc. Overall, I had a wonderful time and wouldnt hesistate to visit here again.", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cBad service, bad location, rooms need repair!\u201d", "Author": "PaymonVancouver_BC", "ReviewID": "UR3779444", "Content": "We just returned from our one week honeymoon in Orlando and we stayed at Radisson Resort Parkway for only two days before we had to get out!

You also needed a code to get the parking lot gate-thing up. Pizza hut was good, and we went to the Mandolins restaurant one night. It was good, but not very busy. Took the shuttle to Disney one day, no problem with it. There was alot of people, so they had to call in another one, but it came promptly. Also picked us up on time at night, no complaints. The only negatives I really found with the hotel was that the dryer in the self serve laundry on my floor was really slow, but it wasn't a huge deal.

There were 5 of us in our room - myself, my husband, and our 3 daughters ages 2, 5, and 8. What can I tell you. For the value, I would definately choose this over a Disney hotel. The Disney hotels would have cost us double, and for what? You're barely there! The shuttle service people were GREAT! Very nice, always loaded our stroller, etc. One time we forgot our Disney passes, and the driver drove my husband back to the hotel!! With small children, the advantage of a Disney hotel would have been that we could have gone back for an afternoon nap with our 2 year old, but Disney is so big, you still would have been travelling. However, the option of returning to the hotel in the afternoon isn't an option, but we were fine. There was only one time the bus was crowded, and we were there during spring break. The restaurant was good for breakfast - which was included in our room rate. The pizza place made great pizza, and the fries portion was generous. Usually, we'd try to eat before we came home, but food was available. The pool was great. Yes, the unheated pool is cool for little ones, but my 8 year old loved it!

We got a fridge, and they never charged us for it. They didn't smell, and they all have new carpet and duvets. The bad things - our safe didn't work - so our passports had to be locked in the suitcase. They tried to fix it, but couldn't. I like when the sink area is separate from the toilet and shower, but it isn't. Still, with 5 of us, it was okay! Our room wasn't ready the first night - not a good thing at 1 AM. We couldn't get the room with 2 beds, so our girls shared a cot, and our 2 year old got a crib. It worked, and we weren't charged for that night. Overall, if we go again, we'd stay there for sure!

First night we arrived they gave us a room that had a VERY strong disinfectant smell. I am usually not sensitive to this but the smell was actually so strong it was burning my nose. As well the door handle to the room was coming off. Called down and they did finally send someone to show us a new room. However, people obviously had been smoking in that room as it reeked of stale smoke. They assured us that it was a non-smoking room. The gentleman who showed us the room agreed with us. Finally got a room that was as odour free as possible (my son said it smelled like wine every time we came in - we don't drink wine!!). Took an hour plus to get the room - not a good start. Booked a deluxe courtyard view - had a view of parking lot. There were never enough towels. When there are 4 people in the room there should be 4 sets of towels - not rocket science! Always had to call down for extra towels (for 2 weeks!). Sometimes they never brought them. Came back from the parks 1 day and carpet in hall was all ripped out. When I book, I specifically asked if they were doing renovations and answer was no. Complained and did get $500 off entire 2 week stay. Beds are very, very hard - never experienced anything quite like it and have travelled extensively. Daughter dropped cherios on the carpet one morning, still there 3 days later! Complained again and they said that they had already given us a deduction in price and that was all they would do for us. Restaurant and deli are way overpriced (especially dinner at restaurant - no one ever there you think they'd get the hint!). We are accustomed to paying more at hotel restaurants and this usually does not bother us but this was ridiculous. Only ate dinner there twice - much cheaper to eat at Disney and better food!

I can confirm several comments by prior reviewers: the beds are indeed firm, the elevator was a bit dirty, the unheated pool was very cold and there is currently refurbishment work (new carpeting) that may inconvenience you as a guest. With that said, this hotel is above average, especially considering the close proximity to all major theme parks in the Orlando area. There are easily 15-20 good restaurants within a 10 minute drive from the hotel. While not a \"resort\", this is a good hotel that is clean and well-maintained. The service staff is helpful and the front desk is professional. I was not bothered by any strange odors from the new carpeting. The room was nice and the bathroom was more than adequate (however I wish the in-room refrigerator was more than an overpriced drink dispenser). The two pools are very nice, in fact we spent more time enjoying the facilities than we had planned. It seems you can definitely get a good price for your room (especially compared to some lower-end hotels nearby... the extra $20 per night is worth it).

We had read all the reviews for the hotel and was not sure what we were in store for? Only had a couple of problems during our stay. 1. At check in they had a hard time finding our reservation, but this was probably not the hotels fault, had more to do with the company we booked our vacation through. 2. On three different days we did not get any towels when they cleaned the room, but on every occasion they supplied us with new towels after we made a call to guest services and they called us back to make sure we had been taken care of. Most of the negative reviews had something about a bad smell in the hotel. We did not notice any bad smell at all. The hotel was laying new carpet while we were there and there was a smell of glue and new carpet smell, but nothing that was detracted from our stay. I will say that our section of the hotel already had the new carpet layed so that was good for us. We did not use the pools due to the fact that it was too cold to swim and we had passes for other water parks. The deli was not bad and had good variety to pick from. The sports bar was great and on our stay had great people staffing it. The hotel does have washer/dryers in the buildings, but only on the second and fourth floors, so it would be a long haul if your not on one of those floors. We were on the fourth floor and right next to the washer/dryers, but our dryer did not work and had to go to the second floor to use the dryer. Location of the hotel is great anywhere from 1/2 mile to a mile away from all the Disney theme parks. If you go east from the hotel on Hwy 192 for the next 5-8 miles there are almost all the eating establishments that one could want. We did not get a chance to eat at the hotel's restraurant, so I can not comment on that. If you are planning on using the hotel's free shuttle service to the Walt Disney World, Universal or Sea World be warned that the schedule is somewhat limited and if your using it to go to Universal or Sea World there are only two shuttles in the morning and one or two in the evening. There is Thriffty Car at guest services, but if you are renting for more than one day you have to call into the 800 number to make your reservation. The exercise room is nice, it always had plenty of towels, has two treadmills, to bikes, a multi-position station machine and a abdominal cruch machine, everyone should find something that they like. Another thing you need to know is that the beds are only two double beds, not queens. All the other hotels that we stay at all have two queen beds, so expect small beds. This was a little nicer hotel so I expected larger beds. The rooms are on the smaller side, but probably about average. The bathroom was not bad, but the shower/toilet is not seperated from the vanity. This is a nice touch when one person wants to be taking a shower and another can be using the vanity, minor details I know. All in all it is a nicer hotel and it does have a lot to offer.

It was a good value for what we paid - AAA rates of $107.56 for the first night and $98.56 for each night after. The rate included a buffet breakfast for two adults, and children under 10 eat free. We got the rates after being quoted higher rates, continuing the research, finding lower rates, and then urging them to give us the lower rates. The hotel was pleasant and staff were responsive. Although we enjoyed our stay there, I'm pointing out both the good and the bad below so that you'll be aware of them. The buffet each morning had the following: sausage, bacon, biscuits with some kind of gravy on the side, scrambled eggs, omelet station, a small selection of pastries, fresh fruit, Fruit Loops or Frosted Flakes and either pancakes or french toast. You could request toast, bagels or bread, and were served coffee, juice and other beverages. A la carte breakfasts (even the continental) started at about $8. So for our friends who had two teens, they felt the breakfast for two of the four cost too much and they bought bagels and muffins nearby for those not eating the buffet. The rooms were pleasant enough. The beds had a duvet and a white sheet-like duvet cover rather than bedspreads and blankets. I found this comfortable. One of our friends was moved to a different floor after leaving for a few days and noticed that new carpeting was being installed. There were other renovations going on around the hotel - the game room was having a new floor put in, and I believe was being painted. As a result, game room machines were moved to what had been the fitness center. The fitness center was closed. It might be that it's being moved to where the game room was - I'm not sure - but it wasn't that large a room originally. The plastic lounge chairs were replaced with more comfortable lounge chairs, as were the tables and chairs around the pool. There is a large lobby, with a fountain, and numerous waterfall landscaping features around the hotel. The pool area is surrounded by the buildings but nicely landscaped. Although the photos from the website give the impression you are surrounded by acres of grass, it's not an accurate impression. There are ponds with fountains in front of the hotel and in the rear, and several neat wading birds would frequent these areas, but the rear of the hotel backs up to the parking lot. The teenagers with us played tennis on the lighted tennis courts behind the parking lot. There was also a playground area and I believe volleyball net off the parking lot (not especially inviting). I didn't see anyone using these facilities while we were there, perhaps because they were behind the parking lot and not especially attractive. The Deli is expensive, but a convenient place to grab a light meal. It has choices of Pizza Hut, pre-packaged sandwiches and salads, hot dogs, and I think burgers. Food is also served at the bar near the pool. There is no poolside waiter service. Bottled non-alcoholic drinks are about $2.75 each in the deli, and wine or mixed drinks are $8 or more each in the bar. Go to the nearby shopping plaza, a short walk across the hotel's grounds for better prices. One of the members of our party noted that she would have liked a room with a balcony, or in which you can open the windows. These windows don't open, but you have full control over the air conditioning and fan. We noticed that although the rooms, outside grounds and lobby seemed clean, the first impression on our arrival was not great because the elevator was dirty (debris on the floor) and in fact, the elevator area remained dirty throughout our stay. The comments about the firm beds are accurate - I like a firm bed, so they suited me fine. And there were more beds being delivered as we stayed in the hotel. For some reason the ice machines don't offer ice cubes - just chipped ice. We had a cooler and had to keep replacing the ice fairly often. Also, there is not a lot of room for luggage storage. The closet doesn't really have the space to store suitcases, and we wound up piling some behind the chair in the room. There is a dresser in the room with three drawers, and a smallish closet. The bathroom isn't that large either. The room also had the beds (we had a room with two doubles), a comfortable chair, a night table on the outside of each bed, and a table with two chairs. There were many lamps, including one over each bed. The hotel offers a choice of rooms, charging more for those facing the pool. Those rooms appeared to be exactly the same as the ones we had, and I don't believe the view of the pool (or the view of those at the pool of you) makes it worth the extra money. Many people made use of the shuttles, although we had rental cars. The shuttles were full size buses and I never observed them too full to take riders. There is a guest services desk downstairs at which you can buy tickets to certain attractions at discount prices. But go to the Disney desk next to it at your own risk - that's some type of timeshare sales desk (excuse me - they'll tell you it's not a timeshare) and if you want information about Disney without hearing the spiel (is that how you spell it?) the woman can be quite rude. Also, we found the folks working at guest services did not always have accurate information about local attractions. So do your homework on the attractions and then compare prices you've found with what the hotel can offer. The hotel was minutes away from Disney, Seaworld and Universal. All in all, we found the hotel a very reasonable, pleasant place to stay. The pools were great and the rooms were fine. The fitness club was closed, and although they didn't initially volunteer it, with perseverence we learned that we had the use of the fitness center at the Celebration Hospital across 192, and that if we paid the $10 fee the hotel would reimburse with a receipt. We did, and used the indoor pool there with the kids on a rainy day.

The last place we loved was a Radisson (it is now a Radisson again, about 2 miles west), and we were excited that our Travel Agent recommended the Radisson Parkway - and for good reason! This is a wonderful place; beautiful and spacious. By now, you know about the pool. I was down there every morning at 8 AM and started every morning with 2 hours in and out of the pool. You are never too old for the pool slide. As we are in our 40's, we were on it as much as any kids were. I've read comments about the mattresses being firm, and they are, but not at all uncomfortable. The rooms are fine - not fancy, but clean and comfortable. The on-site amenities are great! The Sports Bar is contemporary and friendly; the bartenders eager to accommodate. The Deli and Gift Shop are better than average. I was in both every day. Nice to find an on-premises Deli that sells Champagne and Wine by the bottle! All the reports about the staff and their eagerness to help is right-on. This is what really makes this place special. They do whatever they can to accomodate you. We had hoped for a late checkout. As the hotel was completely booked, the Manager was not able to extend us as late as we may have wished, but he worked hard to let us stay in our rooms until 1 PM, and was apologetic he couldn't do more. Things will always go a little awry in a hotel - it has to! Its a building being used and abused by two thousand people. The hallmark of a good hotel is how they deal with it, and the staff here always looks to accommodate your needs immediately. No put-offs, no procrastinating - just action! If we had any complaints, they are minor. And I include them here only so maybe they might take note, or perhaps others have noted them as well. The staff at the Pool Bar and the Breakfast Host at Mandolins were way below the hotel's own standards. I would doubt either will be there on my next visit. And beware if your air conditioner blows over the bed. Some rooms are set up that way, and that led to one of our party catching a cold. Again, I do not blame the Radisson for that; had we said something, I have every confidence they would have remedied that somehow. So this is our new home! We look forward to our next visit.

I had reserved a room at the Hampton Maingate East just down the street (read my review of that nightmare) and moved over to the Radisson after one night at the Hampton. It was night and day difference! I can't remember if I've ever stayed at a Radisson before -- if so, many years ago, too many to remember -- but for sure, I will be staying there again. The level of service of the front desk hotel staff and others was so incredibly warm and helpful, that it's easy to overlook any of the small inconveniences that popped up. Service is everything -- and that Radisson has it down to a science! Having just come from a horrid night at the Hampton, I was very, very cautious about inspecting the Radisson's rooms -- I chose to look at several before deciding. The front desk staff member, Kathy, was wonderful -- always a smile on her face, knowledgeable, friendly and when I had trouble entering one room which appeared to be locked from the inside, she came over herself to make sure the problem was resolved. The mattresses at the Radisson Parkway are very, very, very firm -- the hotel staff forewarned me. Much too firm for my taste -- and I do wonder why they didn't choose a more middle-of-the-road compromise between firm and soft, especially since current mattress research indicates a too-firm mattress is not, in fact, good for our backs. But even with that issue, the Radisson had a way out -- they offered a \"pillowtop\" topper, as my bellman explained. I ordered one for my room, and when I returned at night, my bed had been re-made with the pillowtop! A word or two more about the Radisson's pillowtops -- a good plan, but it fell a little short. The pillowtop had a downlike fill, which was so soft, that it compressed all the way down -- and the result was almost as hard as without it. A better choice would have been a latex topper. I did hear another staff member mention a convoluted foam topper which would have been a better solution for me. I also reported the A/C a bit noisy -- the engineer was up to my room immediately, although when I returned there was no noticeable improvement. However there were messages on my room's voice mail system both from the engineer and from Kathy at the front desk wanting to know if there was anything more they could do to make my stay a pleasant one. To my mind, that level of consideration makes up for a little noise from the A/C. It's also worth mentioning that some of the beds offer duvets rather than comforters. I opted for one of these rooms -- very European looking -- a downlike comforter is inserted into a duvet made of sheet fabric, which appears to be freshly laundered for each new guest. How wonderful -- no more worry about how many others before you had their faces in the blankets or comforters, which are definitely not laundered for each new guest in most hotels. When checking out, the front desk staff member told me all Radissons will be featuring Select Comfort Sleep Number beds, starting in 2005. Although these air beds are not my personal favorite, I commend the Radisson for such a forward-thinking upgrade, allowing everyone to adjust the mattress to his or her personal level of comfort. All in all, one of the most exceptional stays I've had in a long time.

The pools were exceptionally clean and all the facilities were up and running even with the 3 hurricanes that hit in the weeks previously. Management fulfilled our request of having our room deep cleaned as the reviews we read stated most of the rooms reeked of stale smoke...also they were able to make sure we had a fridge already running for snacks and medicines we had to bring along. The mini bar was way overpriced so we were glad we brought snacks. Our bed was a little firm, but didn't stop any of us from sleeping comfortably. We stayed in the 1000 building on the 3rd floor and had a FANTASTIC view of one of the pools and the hot tub with the cascading waterfall. The pool with the waterslide was great for smaller children (ours were 4 and 5), and both of the kids had a blast....hours were 6am until 11pm which was nice to swim later after we returned from the disney parks. They also had a kiddie pool with about 1 1/2 feet of water and a heated pool, and one additional hot tub. Also, we were very surprised to see the pool snack and BAR served perfect refreshments, and were open later in the day also. One of the SMALL complaints we had was that there was not a phonebook provided and local phone calls were charged a dollar a minute. Also the pillows were a little flat so we requested more free of charge. The game room had an air hockey table and about 15 other games in it, it was a lot bigger than expected. Also, the exercise room was nice and had a few of the newer machines in it. The shop in the lobby was VERY overpriced as most lobby shops are, but the GREAT perk was the activities desk outside the shop. Everyone behind it knew more about the disney park hours and prices then you'd find in a brochure. Also, they were offering HUGE discount rates (on the parks) for couples over 30 if they signed up for a tour on a time share or if they were married. Also the shuttle busses were always on time so that was nice. The Mandolins restaurant had a great breakfast buffet open from 7am till 11am offering more than we expected. Fresh fruit and french toast, eggs anyway you want, yogert and lots more. If you dine here make it a breakfast instead of lunch or dinner. The breakfast buffet was under $15.00 and a child under 10 ate free with the paying adult. The dinner portions were smaller, and overpriced, but if you have to dine here for dinner make it the bbq ribs. Across the street was a steak house (Charley's), a grocery store, salon (offering discounts on hour massages), a japanese restaurant, italian restaurant (nice dining outside tables set up and everything), and to top it off a great shop with reasonable prices for gifts to take home and a ton of stuff just in case you forgot to pack a suit or sandles or sun screen. The next shopping mall over included a Nike Outlet store, a Payless shoe store, a Subway, Wendys, and another disney type store selling tickets to local parks, then a surf shop and a discount outlet store with clothes from dkny and levis and they had great prices. Also within walking distance was the WATERMANIA water park (open 11am till 5 pm, discount prices from 3 till close), and a block past was a go cart park that looked like lots of fun. I believe they were open from 12 until 5 pm and closed on Wednesdays. Overall we had lots of fun and would go back in a heartbeat. Next time we would actually go without going to the disney parks because the kids were happy enough to swim in the pool!

For any british holiday makers looking for a good base point for there holiday then I would definately recommend this hotel. It is just down the road from Disney, very close to Old Town and less than half a mile from I92. We will definately go back", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the money !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2283934", "Content": "Used the Mousesaver rate for a free pool view upgrade. The room was a little small, but very clean. The beds were very comfortable, firm just the way I like it (bad back). We were in building 600, which was the best. Right in front of the pool (never too crowded-just right amount of people). Right in front were the shuttle stops, very convienient. Avoid the restaurant-way too overpriced! Cross the street to the restaurants down 192. I highly recomend Charley's, great service, great food, some things are pricey, but my daughter and I shared and the bill was resonable. Also Ocean's 11 was great also. For breakfast there's a deli right there on 192. We would have juice and bagels for $5.00, beats the $15.00 Mandolin's charges or you can eat at Disney for less. Arrive aerly for the shuttles, they fill up fast. With careful planning you can have the awesome vacation, just like we did.

The main pool is huge with a beautiful waterfall. The smaller pool is also nice, warm, and sits adjacent to a smaller waterfall. There are two outdoor spas, one with its own waterfall! They also play nice music in the pool area. We really enjoyed our stay. We did not eat in the restaurants other than to purchase some small items in the 50's style diner that's on property, but there are numerous dining options within a few minutes of the hotel. The 50's diner prices were similar to the food court prices at Disney properties. Our room was very clean and for this price, the decor was fine. I will have to admit that the room had a \"musty\" odor, something that often happens in Florida. This would be my only complaint. The bathroom we had was small...only one sink, but you don't get the Taj Mahal for $100 a night in high season! We wanted a good \"sit by the pool\" resort, and that's what we got! Nice soft towels provided poolside, friendly service, and wonderful atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again. Next time, I'll bring my own air freshener, but do realize that I'm extremely sensitive to smells. My husband didn't notice any funny smell at all. (I think they should pipe in good odors like they do at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge!) This resort is in a quiet, safe area, yet unlike Disney resorts, there are reasonably priced restaurants and grocery stores within a few minutes' drive, and you can be on Disney getting ready to park hop in the time you would spend waiting for the Disney bus! I know, I've done that, too. Try this hotel...if you like a beautiful pool, nice room for a good price, this is a good place to stay.", "Date": "July 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2249055", "Content": "This hotel exceeded mine and my boyfriend's expectations by far!

Once my family and I arrived at the hotel around 1pm, we asked if we could have an earlier check in, since we were traveling since 5am with 3 young children. The clerk at the check in told us to come back at 2:30 pm. when we returned at 2:30pm, another clerk rudely informed us that check in was at 4pm. Of course, we already acknowledged that, but we were told that we could come back at 2:30 to receive the keys to our rooms. In a totally unprofessional manner, she proceeded to call what i assume was the cleaning staff, and carried a conversation in front of me about how\u201d they were here from 1pm,etc.\" and hung up the phone and said that the rooms are not ready yet, and to come back in another 20 mins. She did not seem to care at all about this being a major inconvenience to us. The staff continually asked us to come back in 20 mins until at least 1 hour+ had passed. My children were in the car tired, hot, and uncomfortable since 1pm and now for over 3+ hrs, the staff was completely uninterested and did not offer, not even a single room temporarily for us to use to freshen up etc, until our rooms would be ready. We had booked 2 adjoining rooms to accommodate my family of five, and we received no services for the inconvenience of being kept waiting without our rooms, not even a cold drink for my family, or even a complimentary snack for having to wait. After waiting past the policy check in time of 4pm, we still did not have our rooms. The staff continually claimed how the carpet was wet from being cleaned in the afternoon. I was very upset since this is now 3+ hours and still no rooms to check in to. I insisted on speaking to a manager. He really did not provide any immediate satisfaction to rectify the situation at that point. He said they were understaffed, and there wasn\u2019t anything he could do but apologize, which was no help to me. After I demanded something to offer us for this major inconvenience of our 1st day in Orlando, he reluctantly offered 1/2 price for the 1 room for the 1st night\u2019s stay, and a free breakfast voucher. This really wasn\u2019t enough after ruining our afternoon. When we finally got our rooms, there were no bellhops readily available to assist us with our baggage. all my children including a 6 and 8 year old had to help carry the bags to the rooms. there was only one bellhop that we seen on duty. try to find him is the name of the game there. The kids eat free program is a farce since they overcharge for breakfast at $9.99 for each adult when one could easily go down u.s. 192 west or east and eat breakfast for $3.99 and it wont matter if the kids are free or not. The dinners were overpriced as well, and we never ate at the hotel for this reason. Even if the kids were to eat free, there menu did not offer many dining choices for a family. On to the rooms, they were clean, but the towels are as hard as sandpaper, not even full bath size towels, and the beds really give the feeling of sleeping on concrete blocks, not mattresses. The main pool is nice looking on there website, and is another reason why we chose this hotel. However, it simply cannot handle the volume of guests the week we stayed. There seemed like there were a few groups of guests staying together, and they dominated much of the pool, using it to play football, or to just throw each other in and out of the water even though there are no diving signs. The groups consisted of adults and teenage children; perhaps a school sports team or something of the like. This situation, combined with the undesirable fact that your hotel does not have a lifeguard on duty, made it very uneasy for as family with children to feel comfortable having the children play in the water with all the ruckus going on. Many were using the pool slide standing up as they went into the water. I have stayed at many hotels with slides, etc and there is usually a lifeguard on duty to prevent any dangerous conditions or situations from occurring. Also, the 2nd smaller pool was not of much help since it was outdated and too small, plus it appeared to still be heated water in it in the middle of June\u2019s hot 90+ days, which seems a bit odd. The playground really should not even be mentioned as an amenity. It is far off in he distance with only one piece of equipment that had a slide. The parking lot is not designed to accommodate the guests who would like to be closer to the building that they are staying in. Many nights we would have to park very far and it is not desirable when traveling with children and having to walk a far distance to get back to the room. We clearly were not very satisfied with our stay at this hotel.

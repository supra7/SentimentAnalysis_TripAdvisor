{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Staff!!! A great hotel and GREAT STAFF!!!Checked into the hotel in the afternoon and all i can say is that the staff there was amazing. i spoke with a nice gentleman whose name was Santos, he did a wonderful job in helping us around the city and telling us places to go and where to buy certain things as well as saving money. I don't think i have ever seen a front desk agent as wonderful as Santos was. i would reccomend speaking to santos when you do check in. the area is not as great but its not bad either being downtown san francisco. just ask for alternative routes and you will be on your way.i would reccomend this hotel for people looking for a great room at a great price and more for the staff quality.", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR599754689", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lakers1900"}, {"Content": "Lovely hotel A group of us, eight in total, went to a conference in San Francisco this early March. We found this hotel on the web and were happy to see lots of good reviews on this hotel before we took the trip. When we arrived at the hotel, the rooms were really nice and very clean. The bathroom had body spray shower heads and was very functional. My room had a LCD TV mounted on the wall. It had all basic cable channels. I didn't have any trouble in falling sleep although I usually have difficulty in sleeping when I travel. My advisor also told me that he also had very nice sleep every night during the stay. However, the neighbourhood was a ittle too noisy. We also saw some weird people walking on the streets nearby this hotel. In general, we all enjoyed this hotel. I would like to recommend it to you.", "Date": "Mar 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR444047942", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Olivialei"}, {"Content": "Better that you'd expect, and the best value the area This hotel is way nicer that you would expect given the price and the area. Ok, so the neighborhood is kinda borderline, technically in the Tenderloin, but only a block east of Van Ness which is where Cathedral Hill starts. It's about a 10-15 min walk to Union Square, but I would recommend walking up Larkin and then heading east down Geary or Post rather than Ellis which becomes quite scary about 2-3 blocks east of the hotel. It's amazing what a difference a block makes in this area. The rooms open up onto the parking lot, which is also where the ice and vending machines are. There are no interior corridors. The rooms themselves are very nice, looking recently refurbished, including a wall mounted LCD TV with built in DVD player and input to plug in your own equipment such as a video camera should you desire. There is also free wifi and continental breakfast in the lobby. The bathroom is large with some rooms featuring a big jacuzzi tub/shower combo complete with multiple shower heads that spray in different directions. You can have a great time splashing around like a seal in this thing if you don't mind turning into a prune. The bed is average, about like you'd expect at a Comfort Inn. This is also one of the few hotels in downtown SF with free parking, but it is rather limited, so don't count on a space being available if you arrive late in the evening. All said, this place is an excellent deal, just keep in mind that's essentially a really nice motel in a slightly iffy area.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR548792893", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "hgdf"}, {"Content": "Great hotel, Very Nice Staff, Clean Rooms This hotel is wonderful.

We stayed at the Comfort Inn for 6 nights when we visited San Francisco as part of our round the world trip.As we were on a budget due to the length of our trip overall, we opted for a decent rate of $71 per night. It did go up to over $100 at weekends, but even so judging by a lot of the hotel prices in San Francisco this was a very good deal.We arrived into San Francisco on the BART system. The hotel is about a 10minute walk from the Civic Center stop, although we managed to get a bus up to the property. First impressions were good, we were expecting a motel type property and upon check in the young guy on the front desk was very helpful. We were able to check in despite it being an hour before the room should have been available.When we entered the room we were totally gobsmacked. The room was as good (and as big) as many of the top end hotel chains. Upon talking to the owner (who is a top guy) we found out that all the rooms were refurbished when they took over the running of the hotel. There was a gorgeous king bed (think Sheraton sleeper bed), a huge TV unit/chest of drawers and a very clean bathroom area. The shower also had the massage option where the water comes out of the panel and relaxes your whole body...a nice touch. There was ample space for bags, and a table and chairs which we later found out would be our breakfast table. All in all it was a fantastic room, up there with the best we have experienced in the USA.To the breakfast. It is included in the price (very rare in the US) and is a help yourself service in the main reception. Now this room isn't very big, so if there are lots of people going for breakfast at the same time I would think it could be a bit of a nightmare but as we were always late up, we tended to miss the rush. I would therefore aim for a 9.15 onwards breakfast, great if you are on holiday, maybe not so if you are in SF on business. The breakfast consisted of waffle mix (with a waffle maker available), muffins, cereal bars, cereal and orange juice. You could then use your tray from the room to take the breakfast back and enjoy your breakfast in the bedroom. I know this might not sound like everybody's cup of tea, but it suited us just fine.One word on parking, although it didn't affect us. There is parking available, free of charge, which for San Francisco is amazing value. I gather it is on a first come basis, but there seemed a fair few spaces but I guess it could fill up quite easy at busy periods. Another nice touch though.Now the area, and the only thing the propery falls down on. Having spent 5 months on a round the world trip visiting places like China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Africa we were pretty used to the odd dodgy area. In fairness this probably helped us when we stayed at this hotel, it's not in the best part of San Francisco by any means. You are just about within the Tenderloin area, a notorious few blocks just north of Market where there are plenty of homeless. Now I can honestly say we were never bothered by anyone, but on some occasions we did put our feet down a little so as to get past a few shady characters. We tended to find if you walked up to Geary and then towards downtown you avoided the worst. O'Farrell and a few of the streets below tended to have large concentrations of people hanging around. It's probably like that in most major cities, but since visiting SF in 2004 we noticed a signifcant increase in the homeless which is not good. I would still recommend staying near this area of SF though, it's away from the touristy Fishermans Wharf (still go there though) and near Market with all the shopping, the theatre district and also on a number of bus routes and of course the tram. We tended to walk up to California and get the tram down to the Embarcadero, great value on your 1, 3 or 5 day pass, especially as each tram ride is $5 anyway.To sum up, we really enjoyed our return to San Francisco for our 2nd visit. On a budget we managed to find a great hotel, with fantastic staff, albeit in a slightly dodgy area. The transportation links around the hotel make it a worthwhile visit and for the price I doubt you will get a room as good as that anywhere in San Francisco.", "Date": "Dec 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR976046568", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ju123"}, {"Content": "Not bad for the money was suprised that it was more of a motel than hotel. the parking lot was tiny (as are most in SF) and even though i was in a 2 door car, i was worried about tight parking. i saw trucks that did it though! the front desk employee was VERY helpful, offerred us a map first off and explained that parking was gauranteed until 11:00pm. we arrived too early to check in (around 11:30am), was told the room would be ready around 2:30pm. ice machine is outside and coin operated (never seen one of those before!). there is a Walgreens a block away and a California Pizza Kitchen and Burger King with in a block or two. not sure if due to exhaustion or not, but ended up getting a GREAT nights sleep, which is almost unheard of while traveling. breakfast is... better than nothing... has a waffle maker, but is mostly granola bars and packaged breakfast rolls. i think there might have been some yogurt. we got to breakfast at about 9:20am and it was so picked over that there wasn't much left. i initally chose this hotel because i thought we'd be relying on public transportation. instead, we ended up renting a car and didn't need to stay so close to the downtown area where space is SO limited. it wasn't bad, but i probably wouldn't stay here again unless i had a tight budget and needed to be close to downtown with out a car.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR211671193", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "spokanegirl"}, {"Content": "Clean motel in lousy area I agree with the other reviews that the room was clean and well maintained.

I pretty much agree with everything else said here. I stay in hotels about 48 nights a year and this is probably the cleanest I have ever stayed in.Rooms have evidently been recently renovated and are very nice, though somewhat cozy (small).

Toiletries are basic but included. I forgot my toothbrush and they happily gave me a nice brand name one instead of the cheap ones you usually get.Fairly central location with easy bus access to anywhere. I recommend getting one of the SFMuni Passports; they provide unlimited rides on the streetcars, cablecars and buses.Good deli across the street and several other small restaurants within a block or two although I didn't try them.Area is a little on the gray side but had no trouble; I saw fewer homeless around here than the rest of SF.Staff is excellent and very helpful.

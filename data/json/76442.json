The food selection was quite poor- just trail mix type stuff, yogurt and drinks normally. The cocktail food had some greasy grilled veggies, cookies, and smoked salmon/cream cheese rolls. None of them seemed very fresh. The rooms were renovated and had new bedding/ tv console desk and seemed clean. The woodwork was not renovated, so the closet doors/ interior, bathroom door was all dinged up and very old, probably from the 60's or 70's. The bathtub had dings and looked dirty, but were just refinished poorly, so that the previous scratched finish showed through. The bathrooms also were incredibly dim- no light over the tub. There was a 1/2\" gap between the old door to the room and the hallway, with no insulation in between. I could hear anyone walking down the hall, not to mention any conversations. I could even hear conversations in rooms as I walked down the hallway. The location is near a Westfield Mall, with a food court, so that is convenient, but there is only very expensive valet parking.

Not having been to LA before, I was unsure of what to expect. However, the hotel was very good and modern inside (although does look dated from the outside) and is really a business orientated hotel rather than one for a holiday. We asked the hotel for recommendations for places to eat locally and it was clear that the concierge could tell we were there on holiday rather than business and as such wasn't really that helpful - they did seem more helpful to business guests (no doubt thinking that they are more likely to have repeat stays). The outdoor pool area was very nice, clean and tidy. Rooms were well equipped although our coffee maker did not work but within 10 mins of reporting this another was brought to the room. The rooms were very clean and the beds very comfortable. If you have a room on the front of the hotel you get an excellent view of downtown LA. The hotel is about 15-20 mins walk to Rodeo Drive, however, if you want to go to Hollywood or other major tourist sites you need to get a taxi or the open top tourist bus (whose timetable in October is rubbish!). We did hire a car for 3 days, but in hindsight it would have been better to have a car for the full 5 days. We know for next time, and our fault really. The car park at the hotel is located to the rear and is safe, although expensive, but I guess this is LA. If you have a car, the hotel is very well located for Hollwood, Universal Studios and the coast although as I say, there isn't really anywhere to walk to from the hotel (for tourists) other than Rodeo Drive. If I visit LA again, I would certianly consider staying at this hotel again, although it was expensive (the main reason we picked the hotel was because of the Trailfinders 'stay 5 nights get one night free offer'.

Take into account that I'm a person who prefers somewhat smaller, quirkier lodging with more personality and warmth. I can easily overlook a few dings on the baseboards and doors in exchange for charm. However, at a large, pricey hotel such as this, I do expect things to be recently updated and overhauled, and very very clean. I didn't find this to be true of my room. Yes, the bed was large and comfortable, and the accessories (like the lamps) were \"pretty,\" but the bones of the room looked tired. The hallways and the crystal light fixtures felt very swank and luxurious, but room itself betrayed the age of the place. Especially the bathroom door, which was the cheap wooden type found in old apartments. I got this room on Priceline, and I'm thankful for the discounted rate, as I'd be upset to pay full price. This is definitely a destination for the business/corporate traveler. Again, the public areas such as the lobby and seating areas were lovely, but overall the hotel felt very chilly and, well...business-like. When I stopped by the downstairs bar in the lobby to order a nightcap, the bartender wasn't friendly and didn't return my smile...just plunked down the cocktail and turned away. The hotel is in walking distance to an upscale, outdoor mall just up the street, but you'll have to get into your car for any eating options beside the hotel.

I must say that this experience was awesome from beginning to end and I haven't even left yet (nor do I want to). I came into LA for business and have been on the road for 3 days with over 800 miles travelled so far and needed a place to stay so after a quick \"cat and mouse\" game with Priceline, I was treated to a 4 Star Victory (should be 5) at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza. I arrived at the peak of rush hour which I thought would only add to my already long day and as I pulled into the extra-long driveway with 6 cars in front of me at the valet stand. At most properties, even the high end locations, you'd normally have to wait a good 20 minutes or so as these properties usually have 2-3 guys working the drive. This was not the case here. I swear in a matter of seconds, there were 6 guys that showed up to welcome these new arrivals, with smooth transitions to the bell captains and before you know it, I was welcomed as well with a smile and escort to the front desk. So far, so good. The downstairs lobby, which is huge, felt like it had several separate and distinct areas where people could gather or relax amongst a full service bar with probably 12 TV's in case you want to watch the Lakers overtake the Dallas Mavericks or any other of their opponents. It did not feel like a sports bar however but rather an upscale yet comfortable lounge with a variety of couches, love seats, overstuffed lounge chairs, and tables to accommodate parties of 1 or many. Although the hotel was supporting a convention or meeting group of some sort, it didn't feel crowded or overrun by any stretch. After watching a little bit of the game, and wandering outside for a moment to check out their spacious pool area that I wish I could enjoy had I arrived about 3 hours earlier, it was time to check in to my room. I get to the front desk and after providing my last name, and I'm welcomed warmly and even though the room was booked through Priceline, I wasn't treated like a second class citizen like so many other hotels do with their holier than thou tone in their voice. I was told that I had a king bed nonsmoking room reserved for me (which rarely happens with Priceline) and it would be his pleasure to make dining recommendations if needed, an overview of the amenities of the hotel, and a wakeup call preference if necessary. This might not sound as \"above and beyond\" as I'm making it out to be but I must say that the way these folks make you feel is second to none. I make it up to the room and the decor is very current and contemporary with a nice sitting area, comfortable desk and chair, good sized flat screen TV and a bed that was firm but extremely soft pillow top comfort. After a great night's sleep and a personal wakeup call from a friendly human being rather than the automated computer wake up, my stay is closely coming to an end. I'm at risk to miss my appointments this morning because I don't want to get out of bed!!! I wish I could extend my stay as this was a great experience and the next time I come to town, I might have to book this hotel directly just to ensure I'm not placed somewhere else in the random luck of the draw hotel spinner of Priceline. You definitely can't go wrong with this hotel. I highly recommend it for the business traveler, couples getaway, family trip, or business meeting.

Recently visited the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza for a conference. Great Points: Location, location, location. This hotel is a block from Santa Monica Boulevard and about three miles from Rodeo Drive dining and shopping. It seems to be within a short drive of just about everything you want to see in L.A. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 minutes from Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier, close to UCLA, and pretty convenient to Downtown. Of course, it is very close to Wilshire Boulevard. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in LA for the shopping, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mall a block away. The staff!! Very attentive, from the polite and efficient maid service to the polite and efficient valet parking team, to a checkout desk that was... polite and efficient. Mr Hyatt, you've figured out how to pick staff!! The hotel itself feels like a slightly dated movie set. We had a huge room, with a king bed, humongous bathroom, full-sized writing table, and a full-width balcony. Carpets are a little faded, paint is a little chipped, furniture has seen better days, but the T.V. worked and the in-room safe was one of the largest I have seen in the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c big enough for two laptop computers, cameras, and I probably could have fit my gym bag as well! And speaking of gyms. The hotel has a 25 meter outdoor pool, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free to guests and open to 10pm, and there is a fitness center (Equinox) that is on the Hyatt premises. Equinox is one of those places with valet parking for your Ferrari, and the staff is a little condescending. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got great hours and fabulous equipment, including a spin studio. It costs $20 per day per person; I thought it was well worth it. (I made the mistake one morning of taking a jog over to a nearby 24-Hour Fitness Club. 24-Hour Fitness is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my gym\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in San Diego. If you score the 24 hour fitness clubs in San Diego one point each for lighting, cleanliness, equipment, and friendly staff, most are 4 on a scale of 4. The 24-Hour Fitness Center in Century City, near the Hyatt scores at most a 1 on this scale). The conference center on the lower level was truly outstanding. There is a large theater-style auditorium, and the smaller rooms for the breakout session had good acoustics. I guess the conference center not only attracts guests from every corner of the world, but also what I think was well dressed scum from LA. Why do I think this? Because s/he lifted my new IPhone right there in the conference registration lobby. I think I would have noticed poorly attired scum. One flaw in what would otherwise be a great setup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c breakfast. There is a Starbucks in the lobby that was way too small for the number of people lined up between 6:30 and 9 every morning. There is also a Starbucks across the street, equally busy. We did not feel like driving to get breakfast, and the room service prices are truly extortionist. Bring a thermos of coffee and skip the line! There is a very nice sit-down restaurant on the lobby level. While it does not compete with any of the amazing and quite inexpensive restaurants on Rodeo Drive, we had dinner there one night. The food was good, if not great. Service was very attentive, and very quick for a hotel of this size. The hotel was reasonably quiet. We were on the side facing the street (Avenue of the Stars) and even though we were about 9 floors up, could still hear street noise, particularly busses. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a night club across the street. If you can get a room on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd side facing away from the street, it will be quieter. Price? If you need to ask\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no, actually including hotel room, valet parking (a must), gym, and L.A. taxes, it came out to be about $300 a night for the two of us\u00e2\u20ac\u201c no bargain, but what we expected in LA.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, California", "Title": "\u201cNice room, some drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "David94707", "ReviewID": "UR120706580", "Content": "Very nice hotel with some drawbacks.

I have stayed on three separate occasions over the last year, each a minimum of three nights. The location is convenient, the rooms are very nice, the pool and bar look great. Let me also say that I am a frequent guest at the Kimpton Palomar and the Intercontinental Century City so I know the competition. Each time at the Hyatt there have been frustrations, but the last visit was the last straw. On Sunday midnight 10/31 they had a planned electric power shutdown at the hotel from until 4 am. Yes, I said planned, not accidental. The only notification I received was a note in my room when I arrived back at 11:30 pm. No notice at booking. No notice at check in. No notice the day before. So after an extremely stressful meeting, I could not watch TV, read a book, use my laptop, or take a shower. The Hyatt provided a chemical glow stick for light. Seriously, camping at the Hyatt Regency? Yes, I did complain in person at the front desk. Even though I am a Hyatt Gold member, because I had booked through Travelocity, the front desk could not refund my room so I could move to another hotel. Yes, they did offer me free valet parking in compensation. Sorry, but that did not help me relax so I could get some sleep. The letter said they only do this once a year (lucky me) but the true issue is the management's attitude. This attitude applies to many other issues at the Hyatt, If you stay during the week, and are not part of a convention, you will find the lobby packed, a ridiculously long wait to check in, and an impossible line at Starbucks. The valet parking is incredibly congested and has not improved over a year's time. It can take 10 minutes waiting to drop off your car and over 15 minutes for them to retrieve it. And for this they charge $36 a day! Yes, I have parked in the self-park lot. This is a long outdoor walk in the dark around the corner and up/down stairs to reach the hotel entrance. Not comfortable for women who are alone. Management needs to stop resting on reputation of the hotel from 20 - 30 years ago and start addressing the current problems.

The rooms are very European luxury style (i.e. one big bed and one sink etc rather than the American luxury of two big beds and dual sinks in bathroom) but we preferred this as it made us feel more at home and it added to the classiness I felt. We were on the 13th floor (they called it 14th as the floors skipped from 12th floor to 14th so it was actually 13 floors up but maybe they are superstitious) and we had a great view up towards LA and of the impressive buildings in front of the hotel. We sat on the balcony most mornings watching the sun come up with our coffees. That was one negative there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room so you have to order from room service (extremely expensive) or you can get one from Starbucks downstairs in the lobby, nice touch I thought but some facilities in your room would be nice too. There is a Westfields shopping centre just behind the hotel and in there (along with all the shops) there is a food court and some really good restaurants. We went out for a couple of meals at night there and also got our breakfast from the supermarket restaurant every day. Breakfast was not included in our room rate and was far too expensive for us (plus my boyfriend hates eggs and everything on the breakfast menu seemed to contain eggs) so we had a walk round there every morning and got some fruit salads and coffees to bring back to the room. The hotel has a gym ($20 per person per day for use, but you can use it as many times throughout that day as you like) it seems expensive but you get what you pay for, I used it once and my boyfriend used it a few times. It was lovely, everything so new and clean and also some great machines in there, I was a bit overexcited at the fact you could choose a TV channel to watch whilst on the elliptical machine, I watched half a film on it and increased my workout time by about 25 minutes, the novelty factor was brilliant. It has all the machines and free weights you need to have a really full, good solid workout. They also have daily classes you can attend as part of your gym fee, we didn't try them but they looked good. There is a spa also but we didn't use this as we didn't have time. The hotel has a lovely pool area and outside bar, unfortunately we didn't have time to use this whilst we were there but it looked like a great place to chill out and have a swim, I dipped my feet into the water and it was very warm!! The staff were very helpful and the maid service extremely efficient and thorough. The only downside to this hotel is it's location. It is located in Century City which is more of a business area than a holiday area. There is the Westfields shopping centre nearby which has restaurants, bars and a cinema though so there is something to do. But it is 8 miles from Hollywood and roughly 7 miles from Santa Monica so if you want some proper night-life you have to cab it to one of those places (we used the bus one night and wished we hadn't apparently Los Angeles buses at night are not the safest of places) We got a cab to Venice for $30 which isn't too expensive considering the distance but if you were wanting to go out down near Santa Monica every night it would add up ($60 each night there and back) but then again everything in Los Angeles is spread out anyway so this is not an unusual thing. We hired a car and parked it in the car park at the back of the hotel which was $24 overnight, the valet was $35 but the only benefit from that was that you could go in and out multiple times and the other car park you couldn't. But Westfields car park is free up to an hour or so, so if you need to pop back to the hotel during the day you can park up there and then only use the paid for hotel car park at night which stops the need for valet parking, unless you just prefer the ease of that kind of thing. Overall it is a beautiful luxurious hotel but just a little too expensive for us, if you are really splashing out or staying here for business it is a perfect hotel. One last thing if you want wifi you have to pay for it and it is very expensive, but if you take your laptop down to the lobby and log onto the wifi it is free there, you can then take your laptop up to your room and still have the free wifi for 24 hours from that point. A little tip we were given before we went to the hotel and so glad we were told about it.

The decor is modern, the elevators are rocket ships, and the whole place feels \"new\" century. But, if you look close, you can see elements of the old hotel including a mail chute (how cute). In total, I must say that it was a good hotel with good service and ammenities. My only complaint would be that food service in the Breeze restaurant was painfully slow. It caused my dining group to be late to our afternoon meetings. The prices in the restaurants are what you would expect from a hotel...high, very high. There is a starbucks in the lobby which is very convenient. The folks who work there are the friendliest in the hotel. My other complaint would be the lack of coffee makers in the room. You have to call to room service or housekeeping to get one delivered. Also, be careful with the minibar. It is on a \"hair trigger\". SOME HELPFUL TIPS: -Bring coat hangers if more than one of you will be in the room. You get about 5. -Bring your MP3 or iPod. There is a plugin to the hotel clock radio. So, you can enjoy your own tunes. -There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby and meeting rooms. Use it. Wi-fi in the rooms is $13++ -If you connect a mobile device such as an iPad, iPod etc. to the lobby wi-fi, it stays connected when you return to your room. So, you can keep the free Wi-fi going for 24 hours. -If you use the app Foursquare, be sure to check-in at the hotel. You get a coupon for free coffee at the Starbucks which is a plus given the steep prices. -The mall across the street has loads of good places to eat and shop. So, don't stay stuck in the hotel. -Try to go to Vanilla in the mall for somehting sweet...the macaroons are the best. -For an awesome margarita or other tequilla drink, go to Pink Taco in the mall.

The hotel was full with tarty 'playboy wannabees' and flirtatious middle aged men. This party, like the others was loud and continuous until 1am again. Again I thought they'd have all gone by the morning and I wouldn't see them again. Unfortunately, the following morning, they were all still there, partying around the poolside with loud music. Also, the pool was out of action as this party had got so mental in the night, there was glass in the pool and filter system, so there was no pool for many hours. Now this was my last day. I was only here until 4, so I was very angry to find the pool closed until 1pm.

The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Elevators were very quick. The lobby has a Starbucks for which we were given complimentary passes at check in. We found all the staff extremely polite and helpful. The room is a bit small but not unusual for city hotel rooms, and naturally any remodeling was constrained by the original architecture.

I had an issue with a long distance charge on my bill when I was checking out but after I explained to the lady at the front desk that it was a call to my credit card company (with proof of course) she removed the charge. It was much appreciated. The rooms are spacious with extremely comfortable beds and pillows. Provided in the rooms are a hairdryer, toothpaste, soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner, in room safe, minibar and an alarm clock with ipod dock. There are no robes, which for me was a bit disappointing (but not enough to dislike the hotel). All the rooms have a balcony- that was such a treat because I cannot remember the last time I had a balcony, plus it gives you a chance to find out what the weather is like! I never had a problem with noise. I am not sure if it was because we didn't have anyone in the rooms beside us or because the hotel has thick walls. I guess my only complaint with the rooms was with the one phone we had. It was cordless, but the batteries were completely dead, so we couldn't use it. (again, not enough to dislike the hotel, but if you are going to have a cordless phone, make sure it works- and we did make a note informing housekeeping). My friend and I went to the hotel bar (X bar) one night to get a drink. There were probably 4 or 5 other people there while we were. I guess my experience isn't enough to give a solid review on it. But I will say that I was disappointed that it was closed the Sunday we were there. I never went to the pool during my stay, but my room did overlook the pool area so I got to see that it was cleaned daily. There were always people there and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. I was not really a fan of the location of the hotel but it may not be that bad depending on why you are visiting LA. I went to enjoy the nightlife and see some sights. If you are planning on having a great nightlife I wouldn't suggest staying at the Hyatt only because you are so far out from the action. West Hollywood is about a $25 cab ride from the hotel (so $50 return, not including tip).- it's not cheap. However, you are not completely isolated from the goods of LA. Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive are really close by (you can walk it). Westfield mall is literally a 2 minute walk and it has some great high-end and affordable shops, restaurants, movie theater and grocery store. Also, across the street from the Hyatt is Craft, a fantastic restaurant that I suggest you visit! Regardless of where you stay in LA, getting a rental car is a smart decision because it is hard to get around otherwise. The Hyatt has a Hertz car rental right off of the lobby. One final thing, I was not impressed with the fact that they do not offer free Wi-fi and that you have to pay $5/10min to use the internet in the business area.

The rooms were nice and typical of a 4-star hotel. It was nice having a balcony (I think this is the norm in LA). There is a Starbucks in the lobby and we didn't have a chance to try out the restaurant. We were bummed that WiFi in the room was an additional $10ish per day because we couldn't find this information on the website (the $35 parking/day is easily found there) and thought it may have been complimentary.

Every room has a balcony which is particularly beneficial for smokers. Great video oh demand, which is a staple at most hyatts, but if you plan to use, expect to pay approx $16 per movie.

The bar in the lobby always closes early, with bartenders that are more focussed on the women than the customer service OVERALL again this is a great hotel for either a hyatt patron, or someone who has come for an event at the haytt, but it could be equated to an older woman who has just gotten a face lift to attract its prey, many things are outdated, or poorly thought out in room layout", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "richc78", "ReviewID": "UR105835787", "Content": "Great hotel!

I, too, was there during the \"playboy golf convention.\" They put signs just under each entrance door, so you were walking INTO the Playboy center - not into they Hyatt Regency Centruy Plaza. I spent a lot of money to stay at the HYATT, not at Playboy. There were what appeared to be a hundred scantily clad young girls in the lobby, the elevators, and the hallways. We couldn't go anywhere without seeing young girls in their underwear - literally. I agree with the reviewer who said that families looked horrified - I saw the same thing and I was embarassed for the parents who had to explain what was going on to their children. There were drunk middle-aged beer-bellied men comparing their assigned women (they must have been assigned one for each man). We ate at the hotel restaurant each morning and had to eat next to a daily discussion of whether the men had ... well you know ... with the women at the parties the night before. It was DISGUSTING. The hotel allowed the parties to go on each night in the lobby, out front, and at the pool area in the back. There was no quiet area anywhere. We got NO sleep during this time. The men and women were drunk and loud. The parties began around 7 pm and lasted until about 2 am. Some people got into busses to go to other locations - when they did so, they were yelling and cat-calling in the early hours of the morning. We will NEVER stay at this hotel again and it will be a long time before I stay at another Hyatt. I believe any other convention/conference would have met in the hotel's meeting areas and I believe any other convention/conference would not have been allowed to have a pajama/underwear party in the lobby at 8 pm. Our experience - and it sounds as others experienced this too - is that the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel put the money of the Playboy force above the money of the average guest. There was NO consideration for other guests at the hotel. We were incidental to everything else going on there. It was so crowded that it was difficult to even walk through the lobby to the front of the hotel. We were embarassed to be staying at this hotel; our experience DID NOT meet the level of quality we expected. In other notes, the hotel is very far away from all major activities and you have to take a taxi anywhere you want to go if you don't have a car. The room was very loud.

The first thing we noticed was that the service was absoloutely fantastic. We do not usually care about service, as we keep ourselves to ourselves when travelling and rarely ask for anything. However, their pursuit of excellent service really stood out at this hotel and kind of spoilt us for the rest of our trip. The rooms were large and comfortable, modern and luxurious, i believe 5 star standard, with a nice big balcony overlooking a sort of business district of Beverley Hills. There is also a Westfield Shopping centre a 2 minute walk away so you can buy groceries, go shopping or get something to eat. Hollywood and Downtown LA were both a good twenty minute drive away, we did not mind this as we quite like driving whilst overseas, but you DEFINITELY need a car to stay here, and for that matter, LA in general. The bed was a a big comfy king size, with quite comfortable bedding. The Valet parking became quite expensive, it wa $20 a day plus tips every time they brought the car up to you, or you dropped it off, so may have cost up to $40 per day on some days. All in we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, expecially for the price, which worked out at less than $160 aussie per night for us. We also did day trips from here to Universal Studios, which took around 15 mins and Disneyland, which took no more than an hour on a weekday. Granted, there are many better hotels in LA, many of them closer to Hoolywood or in a better location, but none of them for anywhere near this price.

Upon unloading from the shuttle, the gentlemen out front took our bags and welcomed us to the Hyatt and directed us to the check-in desk or the option of the Hotel Lobby bar to relax for a minute. Either way, we got the Beer ($7/draft of Fat Tire) and went to check in. The gentlemen checking us in, Tyrone, was beyond friendly and accommodating. He was very detailed and told us about all the right places to go for drinks and entertainment. After all, that is why we were there.... We spent hours in the hotel premier bar - X-Bar. It was definitely a very nice time, but be prepared to pay some L.A. prices on drinks anywhere you go. Figure $7 for beers and $10-$15 from cocktails, but hey you're in L.A. so get use to it. The Breakfast buffet was nice, but highly priced at $25+/person. They Regency Club (if platinum member) was a little escape to go to and pour yourself some cocktails (Kettle One, wines, and Brandy available). The rooms were very nice. We had a West Facing 14th floor balcony that set off the L.A. Skyline (which was perfectly clear and rare) all the way to the ocean. As mentioned, all the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and made you feel like you were of utmost importance. After all, they have no idea of your background and what you do and a lot of wealthy folks move in and out of the Hotel.

My work required me to clear my expenses ahead of time, and extras like Internet or gym would have to be approved separately and were a headache. I found when I got there that the room fee included nothing. Gym access and internet had to be purchased daily and were quite expensive. There is a pool, but I found that it is actually not usable for swimming, as it is quite shallow, and is just there for sunbathing I guess? How LA. I also found the bathroom to be underwhelming as well. For such a nice room, I was surprised that this room did not have a bathtub. Even worse, the shower would actually flood, so I could only run the water for very short periods of time. Maybe this is their way of motivating guests to go green? In either case, it wasn't very luxurious.

Chances are, the oversold the king rooms and I was a casualty of their mistake. The main issues had to do with the bathroom. There was a tiny shower, with a bad shower head, with terrible water pressure. The towels were the size of a postage stamp and felt like sand paper. The toilet paper was even a horribly cheap 1-ply stuff that John Wayne wouldn't have used. Good grief people, this is a luxury hotel, some luxury amenities would be delightful.

(However, every time I called down to have my car brought out, it was there waiting for me within 10 minutes when I got to the front entrance). In room wi fi internet access is noticeably slow. If you are running basic citrix, you will see a noticeable delay. No bath robes or slippers provided in the room.

The even numbered rooms look out over the pool and higher floors would have a good view of LA. All have a lanai. First, as noted by others, that this location can be a bit more expensive. There is only valet parking here. $35 unlimited in and out. I called down about 10-15 mins before I needed my car and each time it was there and ready to go. If you need limited access to your car there is another lot not affiliated with the Hyatt at a cost of $24 a day. Next, there is no gym opportunity here other than the Equinox Club just off the pool for $20 a day. This is a decent club and if you want to mix with the agents who represent some some of Hollywood's top stars you'll find them in here. I used the gym one day. It fits the bill. Great locker rooms. There is a nice pool and hottub here. Would be a fine place to lounge the weekend away complete with bar service. However, based on the room rates here you could stay at a boutique hotel in Hollywood for less and likely have a better relaxing weekend. My room was a standard queen room on the 6th floor. It was fine. Comfortable bed, tons of pillows, nice linens, small sitting area and a desk. Theres a good size flat-screen in the room and two phones (one cordless).

As I often stay at Hyatts, I was pleased the conference chose the hotel. Unfortunately, I found the hotel to be in need of renovation, over priced (even at a discounted conference rate) and the level of service sometimes very good and sometimes rude and ineffective. Stay began with a ridiculous run around with keys that did not work and then the bad news, that now that my key worked, the other keys for the room would not. This was not an uncommon problem. The rooms are a good size but the bathrooms outdated, with a dated hair dryer in the closet. Wifi for an additional charge, really everything was for an additional charge. If you are use to running on a treadmill in the morning, be prepared to spend another $20.00 for acess to the spa. No coffee maker in the room, you have to call down and request one, and then request it again, and then again. No robes in rooms. Pool is nice with plenty of chaise lounges. Low point was when I attempted to join friends having coffee at the lobby bar. Sylvanna serving at the bar (which was nearly empty as it was the middle of the day) informed me that I would have to move along as the stools were for paying customers. One would think they would consider a hotel guest a paying customer but no so. Complaint to the desk manager yielded a promise that the food manager would call, which never happened. On the other hand, the catering staff was wonderful in conference rooms. Tech services were as outdated as tvs in the rooms.

Therefore we got a conference rate. We had to pay for everything ourselves, so we do care about value. The good news: The staff was friendly and helpful. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Upon check-out, the front desk was thoughtful and generous enough to give us a little discount, because we complained that the room smelled like some previous guest had a dog in the room recently. (Note: we couldn't change rooms because the hotel was full.) The bad news: Incredibly, there wasn't any coffee pot in our room! That was very inconvenient when attending a busy conference over several days. There is a Starbucks in the lobby but it always had a long line due to the conferences. If you order coffee from room service it was around $9 for the coffee plus added fees of about 25% !!! Our conference provided free coffee only in the early morning, but the conference room was far from our bedroom on the 12th floor...so how do you get free coffee in your room for breakfast? Answer: you DON'T! )-: I associate the name \"hyatt\" with luxury, but our room had no robe, no slippers, and no coffee maker! Tip: There is a Gelson's supermarket in the mall around the corner...we did get a few groceries to bring to our hotel room for a quickie breakfast. You can ask for an empty minifrig for your room for $5 a day. There is a charge for internet too, although it was discounted for the conference. If our conference is in the Hyatt again next year...yes I would still attend and stay at the Hyatt. I did appreciate the friendly service, and I appreciate the small discount upon check-out (because the room smelled like a previous customer had a dog in the room.) This was a nice gesture. Would I choose this Hyatt for a romantic splurge, though? No, if I was paying full price and looking for a romantic getaway, I'd stay elsewhere. I rated this room \"3\" for cleanliness because our room needed a deep carpet cleaning for example. On the other hand, the daily housekeeping were very good about keeping our bathroom clean, and giving us fresh towels etc. every day. In my opinion, this Hyatt is a bit TOO pet-friendly. Oh yes...we didn't hear any noise at all from the hallway, which was nice. But the wall seemed a bit thin between our room & the next one...so that we could hear their television, and we could hear them opening the drawers on the other side of the wall. Fortunately, our neighbors didn't stay up too much later than we did, but it was a bit annoying. Overall, I'd say this Hyatt is average for a large hotel which accommodates conferences.

We stayed from Friday night through Monday. We asked for a room with two double beds as high as possible and we were placed in Room 1556 which featured a balcony looking west. The room was a fair size. Not large, but not cramped. The beds and linen were low quality and not nearly as nice as beds one would normally find at a true 4 Star property. The bathroom was older in look. The molding around some of the wall tiles was wearing away and the toiletries provided were of a low grade/quality. The shower head was also just a standard, lower grade and the bathroom itself was hardly 4 Star. The room had a medium sized patio with some garage sale looking cast off furniture. Our room was on the west side of the building and the view was nothing special - just a view of the mall and a not very interesting neighborhood of office complexes. The hotel is within a 5 minute drive to Beverly Hills and a 20 minute drive to the beach. The pool was out of order for half of our stay which was extremely unusual for a busy holiday weekend. However, because the hotel is nestled amongst high rises, the pool area never really got sunny. There is a health club attached to the hotel. However, the daily fee is $20 and is just one of the ways that this lackluster property seeks to nickel and dime its \"guests\". The hotel does not have coffee makers in the room because they want you to buy coffee from their Starbucks in the lobby. However, they do not open until 6 a.m. and for those of us adjusting from the Eastern Standard Time zone, it's annoying not being able to get coffee until it feels like it's 9 a.m. We did notice that there is ZERO checking of hallways for dirty dishes. We frequently saw discarded breakfast trays left for hours in the corridors. On the last night of our stay we tried to go to bed at 10 p.m. because we had a 7 a.m. flight to catch at LAX. However, after dark, the mall across the road apparently turns into the world's LOUDEST outdoor nightclub. The mall has several bars that BLARE music at levels reminsiscent of the music blared in military siege situations as a form of psychological warfare. (Think the siege of Manuel Noriega where the US military tried to drive him out of his complex by blaring music in an effort to drive him insane). When we laid down at 10 p.m., we could feel the bass beating in the room. Closing the patio door did nothing to decrease the pounding music. After an hour of hoping that the music would STOP at 11 p.m., I caleld down to the front desk to complain about the noise. I spoke with the on duty front desk manager, Clifford and advised we would like to move rooms to the other side of the building because the music from outside was so loud. He acted as if he had no idea about the music. He said he would send security to see if there was a problem. A half hour later, with no knock on the door from security and with the music from outside getting LOUDER, I called back down and asked to speak with the on duty manager. The operator gave me to Debra, the night manager. I advised Debra that we had called a half hour before to complain about the noise. She said that there was nothing she could do as her security guard had stood OUTSIDE our room door and heard no noise anywhere on the floor. I then went downstairs and confronted Debra. She initially tried to claim that there was no noise problem. I requested that she and her security guards come to the room to verify the noise problem. She initially said \"That noise from the mall is a city problem and you need to call the police.\" So, in order to enjoy peace and quiet at their hotel, I would need to be the one who made a noise complaint through the Los Angeles police department - all while Debra STILL insisted that there was no noise problem. As we were waiting for security, she tried to make small talk about the weather. I told her I wasn't in the mood to be dismissed with idle chit chat and that I was stunned that a Hyatt property would treat their guests this way and that I would do all in my power to make corporate know about how poorly guests were treated at the Hyatt Century City. At that point Debra said they were a franchise property with no accountability to HYatt and that a complaint to Hyatt corporate wouldn't make a difference to her AT ALL. She didn't yet offer to move our room to the opposite side of the hotel. She did go up to the room with 2 security guards. One of the guards upon hearing the VERY audible music said \"That's the way it is ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT.\" So, I had an admission from a hotel employee that the music from the mall is ALWAYS like that at night. We hadn't noticed the nights before because we had gone to bed late and exhausted from sight seeing all day. It was now 1:00 a.m. and the hotel's own security guard admitted that the music was a very common problem. Finally, 2 hours after I had started complaining that we couldn't sleep because of the noise, Debra offered to move our room. We had to leave at 5:00 a.m., so by then there was utterly ZERO point in switching rooms in the middle of the night. We packed up and left at 2:00 a.m. So, if you would like to stay in a hotel that has music blaring across the street until the middle of the morning and if you'd like to stay at a hotel where 2 departments' managment tries to deny a major problem affecting \"guest\" satisfaction until a lower level employee conceded that the music is a constant problem - then the Hyatt Century City is for you. Oh yeah. Valet Parking is $35 a night and the valet is run be a separate company that is completely disorganized. It always took at last 20 minutes to \"find\" our car and we stood next to a couple who had been waiting for a half hour because the valet lost their keys. This hotel is a major embarrassment to the Hyatt Brand and we will NEVER stay in a Hyatt or use Pricleline again because of the lies, denials and utter lack of care for guest satisfaction shown by the property's managers Debra & Clifford.

I had a room with 2 beds, and she had a room with 1 bed - a few doors apart on 6th floor. Check in staff very helpful. Bellboy bought luggage to rooms very quickly. The rooms were very large, and had more than enough hanging space and drawer space. There was an iron/board in wardrobe. A fridge - touch it and you are charged for items. The bathroom was fine - with reasonable lighting. Loads of towels - with my usual complaint of bath towels not being big enough to go round a slightly larger lady - so I just used two. There was also a range of toiletries. The beds were extremely comfortable. We found that this hotel is more suited to conferences than tourists and is slightly out of the main \"hub\" of the city. I know that L.A. like London is very spread out. I found the concierge extremely helpful in helping me choose tours and booking them for daughter and I. Our room rate included American breakfast buffet - which I found to be OK - would have liked it more if there had been pancakes or french toast included, but there was more than enough choice. We were given vouchers for breakfast - and if you get them, do look on the back because if you don't want breakfast you can use it at the Starbucks until about 10.30am for coffee etc. worth $12.00. My daughter paid for and used the gym/spa attached to the hotel and found it to be first class. We only sat out at the pool a couple of times - as it was during the week there were only a handful of people around it. It was very helpful having the Westfield shopping centre around the corner with some lovely restaurants in it, lovely shops and supermarket for snacks etc. We were leaving on a Friday and on the Thursday I asked whether it would be possible to keep one of the rooms until we left at 3pm for no extra charge, and they said of course. This was a great help to us in changing for travelling and last minute packing. I did not use the bar so cannot comment on it either than to say it was full of delegates for the main convention on that week the first couple of days. Would I stay here again - probably yes.

Believe me, we have stayed at many over the years she has lived and gone to school in LA! Our new favorite is the Hyatt Century Plaza! The rooms are elegant and spacious as well as the balconies that open out onto a private sitting area with wonderful views, a table and comfy chairs [ask for a room on the pool side on a high floor for stunning views]. The pool area is large and inviting with nice greenery surrounding it, firepit,jacuzzi, private cabanas,bars etc and 2 wading pools. The reception area is beautiful as well. There is kiosk check in[which we didnt use]. And the neatest thing I havent personally seen in any of the other hotels I have stayed in, is the airport checkin computer just for printing your boarding passes in lightening speed! Upon arrival into the capacious shiny marble and glass lobby, We were greeted at the reception desk by a friendly lady who made us feel instantly welcome. It is so nice these days to deal with people who really seem to love what they are doing. She even made sure we got a great room. [I think she actually upgraded us as we had a super saver rate].This hotel has everything from a Starbucks,to a sundry shop that actually stays open most nights until 11, bars, spa and fitness center,casual as well as more upscale dining , and gorgeous grounds. They also allow canine friends which is, for me, always a good sign [though we werent traveling with any pets]. The park like grounds are perfect for strolling or dog walking. One would not know you were in LA! Across the street there is a large upscale mall, The Westfield Center, with groceries, theatres , many great shops, and a better than average food court. The rooms are so comfortable! The first night we had trouble with our ac though it was cool out and we didnt really need it. But they came immediately the next morning and fixed it..the nicest 2 men, very apologetic and quiet as they worked. Then we were offered a free movie for the inconvenience. We have stayed at The Renaissance, Beverly Hills Hotel, The Roosevelt, the Mondarin, the Ritz Carlton Marina Del Ray, The Palomar Westwood [our second favorite], Parc Suites in B Hills as well as private rental homes. But this hotel for us had the perfect balance of glam,comfort,friendliness,great bar..try their special Skywalker martini, service, ambience,outside space, and views! We felt much more special here than we did at the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is getting ragged around the edges these days. So Park Hyatt.. we are your new regulars! [they also have an extended business center for all your needs, and also prompt courteous valet service ..you may self park as well at the garage behind the hotel, a luxury money saver in LA]. Try this hotel, you wont be disappointed..if I had one tiny thing negative to say it would be only that the food at Breeze [other than the delicious kobe burger, 18.00$ ] for lunch that day wasnt the best for the price [though the waiter was extremely nice ]..I had the sushi special, rainbow roll..I've had much better at some of the little hole in the wall sushi places around the area..the 80 dollar bill took my breath away..but then I guess that's LA] Yet it didnt dampen our perfect stay one bit!", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPretty swish\u201d", "Author": "Offagainareyou", "ReviewID": "UR38628614", "Content": "A very swish hotel with very nice roomsand comfortable beds.

Dutifully calling restaurants after they opened, he came through with a terrific restaurant, at the time we wanted, and a great table to boot. Do beware, however, that there are some fees that, while not hidden, are unavoidable and will significantly boost the nightly cost. First, there is no street parking anywhere near Century City; valet at the hotel will run you $33, and a self-park parkade on the back side of the hotel is both rather inconvenient, priced at $24 a day, and doesn't have in-and-out privileges (i.e., you'll pay each time you leave).

Used the Super Shuttle airport limo to/from the airport, and it was fine ($14 vs. $40, est., for cab from LAX). The concierge set up the return trip for me from his desk. Painless. Also a place in the lobby to print boarding passes and other travel documents, connected to 2 computers w/Internet access. Convenient! (The airport was another story, however! Be sure to allow at least an hour to get through security for United when you are headed home.) Loved my room! Comfy chair with foot stool, desk with 2 (2!) chairs, bed with plenty of pillows of many sizes, good fee-based WiFi access (also an ethernet cable in the desk), many plugs for recharging cellphone and computer batteries, and nice, large bathroom with plenty of counter space and great traveler sample lotions and potions. May sound strange, but I really liked the elevators. They came quickly - never a long wait for an elevator, and it's a big hotel. And the food, whether at the conference or in the restaurant, was excellent. Frou-frou (this is LA, after all), but excellent and a teensy pricy. There is a food court at a nearby shopping center, a couple of blocks away, for a change of pace and a chance to get outside for a short walk. Only two negative comments - marginally negative, at that: 1.) The billing. It was a 4 day conference, but I could only get the conference rate for 3 of the 4 days. The second night was at the higher AAA rate. So, I received 3 bills - one for the first night (conference rate), a second one for the second night (AAA rate), and a third one for the last 2 nights. The good news is that they didn't make me check in and out every time. The bad news was that you would assume, in 2009, that Hyatt's accounting system could manage 1 bill for all 4 nights, given that I stayed in the same room the whole time. 2.)

Further, the cost of everything is alot higher at the Plaza, for no real added benefit. Food, though is the real issues. The Intercon has a changing interesting menu, good wines, and a unique cocktail list, while the signature rest. at the Plaza is really terrible, and does not even bother to have a drink list (the lounge is adequate and there is a decent but way overpriced bar --12 per cocktail minimum) I actually have no idea, but if I had to guess, I would bet money the Intercon is non-union and the Plaza is a union property, based only on the drasticaly better service at the Intercon.

Paper cups at the Hyatt? There was no coffee maker or coffee. There was no microwave. There was no refrigerator. That said, they spared no cost in installing an intricate mini-bar with extremely expensive M&Ms that were attached to a sensor device so that when moved your room was automatically charged.

They generally left you alone (I think they primarily cater to people there on business), but were always friendly and provided useful advice. Yes, valet is $33 a day (there is self-park a 2 minute walk away for $20 each time you go in or out), but that is pretty typical for this kind of a location. The valet guys were helpful with local area advice, and they got my car super fast. I stayed in a Regency Club room and loved it. I actually don't know if the rooms are any different than \"normal\" rooms, but you get access to the Regency Club in the lobby that has free breakfast in the morning, drinks throughout the day, and appetizers in the evening. It also has free Wi-Fi access and 2 computers with a printer - very handy. It's a very functional room, affording a surprising amount of privacy for business conversations. I LOVED the room. I was on the 18th floor - not sure if this is a special Regency floor or not, but it was great. Very wide and stylishly appointed hallway that slightly curves so it feels smaller and more personable. I had an even numbered room, and those look out west towards the ocean and the sunset. Checked in around 3pm as the sun was starting to set, and the whole room was just washed in glorious sunlight. Great views towards the pool area and then all the way to Santa Monica. Had no trouble seeing Catalina, even though it wasn't a particularly clear day. Very expansive view. Loved the balcony, which they call the lanai. It is very large and has a carpet, feels very cozy. Room is huge, tons of space, everything very functional and fresh looking. Nice big plasma TV (which I didn't even turn on). Big, luxurious and modern bathroom. Only two complaints about the room are that (1) the water pressure in the sink (but not the shower) was very low, and (2) the mp3 attachment for the clock radio was crappy and there was interference when I tried to play my Zune. Very convenient location - there is a fancy open air mall a 5 minute walk away that has a ton of dining options, from food court to very fancy. UCLA, Beverly Hills, Hollywood - all are only minutes away. The pool area looked fabulous. I only got to relax out there for a little bit. It had that old-Europe beach club feel to it.

Ok, this seems to be a pretty standard fare at luxury hotels throughout the US, but still...! Then, the room: mine was very nice, newly redecorated. Bathroom was ample and quite nice. I liked the plasma tv (42\"), but I find a bit strange that such a pricey place in a fancy city like LA doesn't provide you with complimentary slippers or bathrobes or coffee machine! Guys, come on! Internet is fast yet expensive in room (even though it's free in the lobby area). I liked the nice lanai. The swimming pool are looked ok. Again, I don't believe you have to pay 20 USD/day to access the Equinox fitness center! I didn't try the food, nor the room service; while the food and the main restaurant looked very nice, the prices were on the VERY STEEP side! Not even the Ritz-Carlton Dubai was so expensive! Location wise, it worked well for me: being in LA to visit UCLA it was a short drive from campus, and Beverly Hills is really minutes away (you can actually walk).

Once we persuaded the concierge that we really did not want to hire a car and pay the exorbitant hotel parking fees he was very helpful in showing us how to walk to Rodeo Drive (10-15minutes away) where you can get a 45 minute tour of the stars homes on a tram for a fraction of the cost of the coach tours that collect you from the hotel. Outside the hotel are regular buses to Santa Monica (cost 75cents), the Farmers Market ($1.25), and Hollywood ($1.25). The bus guide tells you to catch two buses to Hollywood but if you are willing to take a ten minute walk at the Hollywood end you save time and money.

The fitness centre and spa, widely advertised by Hyatt, both in their hotel description and Concierge email service, is a completely seperate business and hotel guests are treated no differently from the general public. In fact you can't even transit the facility, the easiest way to the nearby mall and hotel grounds, as the spa staff actively 'police' the entrance and send you round the street. This is false advertising by Hyatt and they should be held to task. The gym which is good is a $15 charge per visit - $30 a day for our room. I consider that expensive. The pool has the landscaping of the local carpark, inadequate & poor pool service and again the cafe, which serves the best range of juices and food, is a seperate business and only takes cash , not charge. None of this is clearly explained and you are left to 'stumble' around finding things out for your self.

Internet cost ya, no coffee make in your room, no business center, room service is highway robbery, in room items are highway robbery, and valet is a joke. People pay all this money to stay here and yet the most basic creature comforts are not included or cost a ridiculous price. I needed to use a computer with a printer to print Dodger tickets... I was sent down to the business center (After paying $10 bucks for internet in my room) and was charged $7 for using their internet for about 40 seconds, and printing three pages (my tickets). No one thought it would be nice to help a customer out. The concierge blew me off when I asked, and the front desk had no idea. If there is a lesson to be learned it is this. If you want to pay a lot of money to stay at a \"cool\" hotel that is fine. But don't expect nearly the same service, amenities you will get at a Holiday Inn or Comfort Inn. Sad this is the case, but hands down the smaller guy on the block offers a lot more for the buck then the big dog. For me and my girlfriend it is a lesson learned.

The elevators are very fast and rooms are comfortable. The lobby is nice and it's cool having a real Starbucks right in the hotel, though I though it odd that it was not open when we checked in at 4:00 p.m. However, I have to warn you that the Hyatt (and similar hotels) have designed ways to get as much money out of you from the moment you check in until the moment you leave. As others have mentioned, valet parking is $31. When you drive in, the sign says valet and \"grayed out\" are the words self park. In other words, they have removed that option from the front of the hotel. You can drive around the block and find the garage and park there at $10 a day but you will pay $10 each time you come and go (the hourly rate reverts to a daily rate after two hours). Anyway, the process is by design to get you to valet park and pay $31 (+ tips). Next, there is a hi-tech mini bar in the room but there are no prices on the snacks. If you pick up a bag of potato chips looking for the price, you might be charged for them because the minibar detects removal of an item and automatically bills your room for it. It says that on the glass door, but you might not notice that (as we didn't). I didn't get internet access, though I normally do. However, I'm sure they charge it.

The rooms have very nice balconies and no matter which way your room faces, it's nice to be able to sit outside. The beds are also very comfortable. However, all this is negated by bad housekeeping. My bathroom floor this time was covered in hair. Not just little stray hairs, but lots of long, black hair which was impossible to miss. I did not arrive until really late, so I just took a towel and wiped them up myself, which I immediately regretting doing. When I lifted the towel, it was clear that the floor had not been washed in a while. UGH. The next morning, as I was getting ready to take my shower, I looked for the first time at the towel rack in the tub area, and realized that both towels there were used. DOUBLE UGH. I called housekeeping and while they were up in a flash with clean towels, I was disgusted beyond belief. As I left for the day, I reported all of this to the front desk, and when I got back, there was a message from housekeeping apologizing - sort of. It said they were sorry *if* their housekeeping did not meet my standards. I am pretty sure this doesn't meet anyone's standards, and the \"if\" in the apology sounded hedgey to me. Anyway, I was leaving at 5 the next morning and did not have the time or inclination to pursue it further. Unfortunately, the worst was yet to come, when at 4:30 that next morning I tried to take a shower only to find that there was no hot water. I got a tepid shower, but my colleague could not even get tepid water on her floor. She reported it and the hotel accomodated her with a credit, but still - it was a lousy way to start a long travel day. In any case, the long and short of it is that I've had 2 nice stays at this hotel and 1 pretty bad one, so I am giving it an Average rating.

The hotel's sweeping arc design has set it apart from other hotels in the area and made it an easily recognizable icon for some time. This hotel has been the choice of presidents, stars, and general business travelers and tourists alike for quite some time. So booking at this property, one should understand that it was designed and built in the 60s. Rooms are of a typical size from that era ... not very big. The bathrooms, too, are on the smallish side when compared to today's hotels. It kind of irks me when I read reviews where people moan and groan about this ... as if this was a hotel that had been built to today's standards. In all, I found my room to be superb. It wasn't huge, but it did have a lounge chair, a desk/table with two chairs, and a king size bed. The bathroom is compact, but nicely updated and clean. The room's patio was carpeted with all-weather carpeting and had two patio chairs with seat cushions. A widescreen LCD TV was provided, as was an iPod docking station. The room's decor was quite nice. It hearkened back to the mid-century roots of this hotel without being kitschy or over-done. The room appeared to be well maintained and clean ... and my standards for cleanliness are high. The staff at the hotel are well-trained in taking care of their guests. Valets were prompt and courteous (and they didn't change my radio station or move my driver's seat, thankfully). The housekeeping staff was pleasant and efficient. The front desk staff were always friendly and professional ... making good eye contact and resolving issues. The issues we had were minor. We put some items of our own into the room's mini-bar fridge ... and then saw a placard stating that if you do so, your folio will be automatically charged for the items removed. I'm not quite sure how this high-tech fridge does that ... but it does ... and the charges did show up right away. We reported that to the front desk staff on our way to dinner that night and it was taken care of promptly and even with an apology (even though it was our mistake). I was disappointed that the room didn't have a DVD player, but I phoned the hotel's concierge service and asked if one could be provided. \"Absolutely! We'll have it brought up right away.\" And it was ... within 5 minutes ... all hooked up and ready to use for our entire stay. That's service. You will read in other reviews about the location. Some will like it, others will say it isn't in the heart of anything. We enjoyed it and found the shopping and dining nearby to be just fine.

We foolishly had breakfast at the hotel, because we had a food and beverage credit as part of our rate. Service was beyond bad, and when we checked out about 1 hour later, they still hadn't charged the bill to our room. That took another hour of waiting, which made no sense at all. 2.

My guess is that because we booked last minute and negotiated a lower rate ($199), we were not eligible for a quiet room, or perhaps all the quiet rooms were already taken. If you stay here, make sure that you get a room on a very high floor (PH at least) and that you are not over the bar, the front drive, or the construction site. (Oh, and there is construction on the 19th floor so avoid that as well). And bring earplugs! Our cautionary tale: We were given an 8th floor room over the hotel bar's outside area, and on our first night were subject to loud music and rowdy patrons well into the wee hours (this was on a Wednesday night). The manager was extremely sympathetic and moved us to a room on the other side of the hotel, on the 14th floor, after personally inspecting the room himself. He also gave us a 50% discount on the room for the night. This room seemed quieter during the day. When we got back to the hotel around 9pm, we could hear a raucous party with a band in the tent out front. Luckily that ended at 10pm. But when we tried to go to sleep that night, we realized that we were directly above the front driveway and busy intersection -- valets blowing piercing taxi whistles, cars honking, etc. There is also a construction site across the street that is very noisy.

My room was at the south end of the hall. Drawbacks to this location: early morning noise from construction next door, and late night noise from loudspeaker in the fully automated parking garage (\"remember to take your parking ticket with you...\" over and over and over again). Hotel parking is $30 a day with in/out privileges; in the off-property structure behind the hotel is $20 a day with no in/out. It is a hike (including an incline and 2 flights of stairs) from the off-property structure. The hotel architecture is is straight out of the 1960s, so think austere, glass, featureless. On a hot day all that glass makes the entire western exposure of the hotel a furnace. Keep the black-out drapes drawn during the day because no amount of A/C at night will cool down the room again after getting all that sun all day long. Do they skimp on housekeeping staff? On day 2 the room was still not made up at 1:30 p.m. By 7 p.m. the glasses that lined the hallway in the morning were still there, along with trash left behind by the housekeeper in the morning. The room was very nice, the bed was a dream, the towels were very soft and plump. Nice toiletries (though I generally use my own because I prefer fragrance-free). I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HOTELS DON'T PROVIDE SHOWER CAPS ANYMORE!!!! This item can't cost more than a couple of cents, but no matter how much I pay for a hotel anymore I can never get one. You have to plead with housekeeping to send them. It has to cost them more in labor to walk them upstairs than they save by leaving them out of the room. And it makes them look soooo cheap! New, flat screen digital TVs, but no sleep timer on the remote. New-fangled clock radios that let you dock your gadgets (if you've got 'em, which I don't). But no way to re-set the time to the correct time, and no way to adjust the blindingly bright display in a room that should be dark. The shockingly poor condition of the furnishings in the ballroom area is something to remark on. Filthy, stained, worn upholstery on the chairs and sofas in the lounge area. Stuffing coming out of the pillows. Dark, ugly stains on the chair cushions in the poolside cabanas. I guess, given the choice, I'd rather the sleeping rooms be better maintained, okay, but the overall impression the hotel makes is seriously eroded by the condition of the public areas. For the size of the hotel, the public areas leave a lot to be desired. There is only one smallish restaurant. The most reasonable item on the lunch menu was an $18 turkey burger -- excellent sandwich, but astronomical price and poor service (had to eat hunched over a coffee table in the lobby/lounge, had to ask twice for napkin and silverware, long wait for check to be closed out). Starbucks and shoebox-sized gift shop offering soft drinks and candy bars were the only other options. Room service menu very limited and extremely pricy.

We went to eat at the Century Plaza mall several times, and the standouts were Houstons and French 75, both of which had terrific food and treated my son with respect.

Driving from Disneyland, we called the hotel to find out how long it would take us to get there. We were told, \"two and a half hours\"! We were incredulous, and sure enough, it took us less than an hour to arrive. When we checked in, we asked how long it would take for us to get to The American Girl Store in The Grove. Now, it's only about 4 miles away, but we were told, \"forty-five minutes\"!! Maybe they gauge these travel times based on peak travel with multiple car accidents along the way, but their estimates were so far off from reality they weren't helpful at all. We were taken aback by the valet parking charge of $31 per day. We were told about alternate parking but it would be about $20 with no in and out priveleges. Both a parking valet and front desk clerk told us it would cost us $20 each and every time we parked and left. Because we arrived late and just wanted to get some sleep, we parked at the hotel and didn't check out the veracity of their information regarding the other parking lot. As another review mentioned, the front parking area is quite congested. Be sure to call ahead to have your car brought around if you use their parking. Everything about the hotel is beautiful from the lobby to the hallways to the rooms themselves. The beds were comfortable, room decor was lovely. I would probably stay there again but cringe at the thought of the parking charge. We used the pool one evening but it closes at 10. I think that's a bit early, considering that loud voices were coming from the outdoor bar area well past midnight.

I hope this will help people choosing their hotels in LA. I visited LA, SF and NY from 7/12 to 7/24 and stayed in 5 hotels along the way. Hyatt Regency Century Plaza is by far the BEST hotel of the whole trip. Stayed there between 7/12-16. Picked up the hire car at the airport and drove to the hotel directly (OMG the traffic!). Got there at about 6pm and the valet parking was a bit chaotic. Very limited space in front of the hotel. The lobby was very grand as you could expect from a Hyatt. Went to the receiption and told them my details and showed them my newly registered Gold pass - was told that since we used an 'Online agent', no points would be earned, except incidentals. Nevermind, worth a try. The guy (Alessandro or something) was very polite nevertheless. Parking was about $30 I think with in/out. Asked for a high floor room and got assigned a room on the 26th floor. Tipped the guy ($20) as he was very helpful. Thought we would be given the smallest room but to my surprise it was a very big king delux (could easily fit another bed in). It faced the Ave of the Stars and directly opposite the 2000 office building across the road. You could see a bit of distanced houses and even a bit of the sunset. Although it's right on the main road, you couldn't hear much at all once doors to the balcony are shut. The balcony itself was carpeted and with two chairs and still space to move around. The bathroom was huge as well and plenty of toileteries. Shower wasn't powerful though and there wasn't any space you can put the toileteries (no ledges no racks - a bit inconvenient). Since we hadn't eaten since the morning, we hurrily went over to Century Plaza's well recommended food court. OMG I was stuck! So many choices!! Settled with sushi after 20 mins of checking out the counters and ate it outside - beware of the pigeons, their hungry eyes were quite disturbing. Went down to Gelson's to get some fruits and water etc. Nice store but I would recommend the few stores close to (one open 24 hours I think) on Sonta Monica Blvd, close to San Vicente intersection. Much cheaper. Century Plaza had all the famous brands though. Went back to the hotel and checked out the pool and the gym. Pools (one main and a coupe of splash pools for kids) were outdoors and were OK. I am not sure if it was a temp arrangement but the gym was next door (Equinox) and needed to pay to use it. Apparently it's very popular among the celebs and there was a long waiting list for memberships. Express our discontent that we had to pay to use one basic hotel facility. That Alex guy mentioned above whispered to the person we were talking to and immediately he offered some breakfast coupons to shut us up. The magic of tipping! So got to enjoy breakfast every morning and Marie in the Breeze restaurant who served us a few mornings was very attentative and we tipped her every morning too. Food was OK, we chose buffet breakfast as it's easier. Fruits were good with few choices of cereals. Cooked section could be better as choices were limited. It was OK though. Also newspaper daily by the time we got out of the room - probably one of the Goldpass benefits.. All in all, enjoyed my stay very very much. Highly recommended.

One can tell from the architecture that the property probably dates from the 60's, but the hotel has been renovated so thoroughly, and seems in such great condition, that it's really difficult to tell what the true age of the place is. The primary giveaway that it's an older property is that each room has a balcony you can walk out and sit on chairs they've placed onto each balcony. The view from the East side of the building is onto a shiny silver building with striking architecture (according to office workers who work next door, this silver building is home to the Los Angeles branch of the C.I.A.). Behind the Hyatt, on the west side of the building, is the sunny side of the building with the pool (which I am kicking myself for not bringing swim shorts). There are reflecting pools there, and people can tan quite easily there. The gym is next door (it's a branch of Equinox, a super fancy fitness chain), and there is no complimentary gym access for Hyatt guests. A day pass will run you $20. WiFi access is free in the lobby. In the room using Ethernet, the cost was $10 for 24 hours of access. With our AAA membership, we managed to get free breakfast vouchers which we were able to use in the downstairs restaurant. Apparently the Hyatt just started a breakfast buffet at this location very recently. The buffet offerings were kinda meager... different kinds of cereal, yogurt, lots of pastries, eggs, quiche and chicken sausage. Beyond the balcony, the furnishings in the room were very modern. A widescreen flat panel TV. A minibar fridge that apparently charges you if you so much as touch it :-) The bathroom was nicely sized and when my wife asked for a showercap, the housekeeping lady ran off and came back with three little showercap boxes. The mall next door has an AMC movie theater, a very diverse food court on the top floor and a full grocery store on the bottom floor, so if you're doing business in one of the office buildings nearby there really is no reason to rent a car or pay the parking fees. The taxi to and from LAX airport was just over $40 each way. Aside from the minibar fridge (which I didn't open), there was no other fridge in our room in which to store perishables.

The bathroom was a great deal bigger than most hotel bathrooms and very nice and clean. Our room was kept very clean and our housekeeper always honored our requests. We tipped her daily so that probably helped. Coffee (Starbucks brand), tea, USA Today paper and fitness center was free with our Hyatt Gold Passport (wonderful tip from a Trip Advisor member!). My friend and I ate mostly at the food court at Westfield mall across from the hotel. There were many restaurant choices in the food court. If your on a budget, go to the New York deli. It's not in the food court but, at the back of the mall. They serve enough food for two people. The salads are HUGE! I ate one meal, lunch at the Breeze restaurant. I had the crabcake and steamed dumpling appetizers. Both were good but, a little too fancy and pricey for my taste. Remodeling construction was going on on the top floors 17th and 18th of the hotel so there was some noise complaints from conventioneers about that. I assume the construction is going from the top floors down. I went on one of the LA Tours tour of LA and also did my own sightseeing by bus.

We got married in a small ceremony Saturday and thought we'd stay the night at a nice hotel here in town. We will be having 2nd wedding (church wedding) and honeymoon in Ireland in 2 weeks, but we wanted to treat ourselves to a special night here. Since we're spending an arm and a leg on the Ireland trip, we thought we'd try priceline to get the room here in LA. Honestly, I was hoping to get the Beverly Hilton, because the last 2 times I used Priceline for LA, I got that hotel. When we got this one for $100, I was disappointed, especially after seeing the reviews here. However, when we got there it was incredible. Check-in was a breeze, and when we told them we were just married they upgraded us to a beautiful suite on the 18th floor that overlooked LA! The suite is about 700 square feet, and includes a private/separate and well appointed \"powder room\", a dining area that seats 4 and a living area. Also, there is a TV, mini-bar and coffee/tea service and a walk in closet! The view is breathtaking and there is a balcony with a small table and chairs. The color scheme was light and very welcoming and comfortable. As we looked to the left, there were big double doors and through them was the bedroom. It was fantastic! Spacious - with another closet, iron, and fresh, fluffy robes! The modern master bathroom was also spacious and super clean. And the view!! The bedroom also had an incredible sweeping view of LA and another balcony w/ chairs and a table. And the bed. Oh my. So, comfortable, fresh, and relaxing. The duvet was so fluffy and soft, you just melt right into it. Before settling in, we decided to have dinner at the restaurant Breeze there in the hotel. We both ordered the filet mingon, medium rare. I have traveled all over the world and have had many wonderful meals, but I have to say that this was by far, the best filet mingon I have ever tasted. I found out via their website that Breeze was rated one of the Top 20 New Restaurants of 2001 in the USA by Esquire Magazine as well as a Top 10 Los Angeles resturant and I can see why! I figured it would be a nice meal, but never expected just how incredible it would be. What a treat! Also, we happened to tell the waiter we were just married, and at the end of our meal, he suprised us with a decadent creme brulee, compliments of the chef with his congratulations. Amazing. It was so cozy that my husband called to request a late checkout - they said, \"no problem!\" and gave us until 2pm. Even the valet guys are great, Jack was especially personable. If you have any doubts about this place - don't! It's a fantastic hotel. Clean and comfortable, wonderful staff, great views, quiet, spacious rooms, etc. I will say that $27 IS pretty darn steep for valet parking - that's my only quibble.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cgood value\u201d", "Author": "dr63", "ReviewID": "UR4111330", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel (now carrying the Hyatt, not the Westin name) for four nights.

I just think that for a hotel of this star rating and the price that should be cleaned. I've stayed at other hotels at the same price and star rating that would never leave dirty room service dishes in the hall way. They send someone to collect the dishes.

We went up to the room on the 14th floor, following the staff orders, to take the elevators on the opposite side from the check in desk, still no one to help us with our baggages.

We ran down at the cheking desk, scared that they would charge us 2 imaginary days on our credit card, there they confirmed that their computer said we were supposed to have a 3 days stay, we told them the voucher we gave when we checked in said 5 days, of course they said they had lost the voucher, and that they would make their researches, and that everything would be settled on our departure date, with a tone that clearly said they would leave it on the side until we check out and just take the 2 days stay on our credit card, then pay back we were not lying. I had to call our travel agency and have them call the hotel so they could confirm it was a 5 days stay all paid. Then we went back to the desk asking for a paper saying they wouldn't take any money for the stay from the credit card. They told me I would have it at the end of the day, but nothing, they said the manager wanted them to wait 24 hours to make the papers, could not understand why but said ok, again nothing when we asked the paper the next day.

I waited over 20 minutes at the front desk to check in, and then I was not even given the accomodations I had reserved. The elevators were broken, none of the ammenties for Preffered guests were in the room (robe, coffee, etc) and the operator was impossible to reach on the phone. I travel over 18 days a month, mostly staying at high end properties. I have never had so many things be wrong in one stay, compounded with the most disinterested personnel I have ever encountered. I realize now that many of the deficiencies are due to a long running union strike. This would explain why at around midnight every night, horns and megaphones are engaged outside in the street to draw attention to the strike. I'd say that is not necessary, it is very evident. To add insult, when I received my AX bill I was charged incorrectly and had to spend further time arguing with them. I'd make a wide detour around this disaster.", "Date": "April 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cVery comfy!\u201d", "Author": "fundatty", "ReviewID": "UR3253858", "Content": "We stayed here for one night at the end of a Disneyland trip to be closer to LAX. The hotel is very attractive and the beds were super. Our only problem was that the first room we were given had a barking dog in the next room. We were quickly switched to another room which was quiet, but not as large and nice as the first room. Since it was only for one night, I did not complain. We had breakfast the next morning in the Breeze dining room. The food and service were very good, but a bit pricey at $75 for 2 adults and 2 children. The location of the hotel is very nice for visiting the Getty Center and Hollywood.", "Date": "March 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201c4 Star Amenities/ 3 Star Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3250768", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Westin Century Plaza from March 1-3. I actually used my Starwood points for this trip, and got a nice room overlooking 2 giant office buildings that were under construction. To comment on the parking situation based on previous reviews, I had no problems with the Self-Parking lot. You do have to go right past the hotel and make a right onto St. Regis Ave to get to the garage, and walk across a pedestrian bridge from the garage back to the hotel. But I'd rather pay $20/day, than $25/day + tip for valet and be able to get my car whenever I want. We checked in and were given a room on the 17th floor right next to the elevators. The room was very clean and updated and was truly a 4-star quality room. The beds were very comfy and the shower is highly enjoyable. We arrived late in the evening and had already eaten dinner, but my wife wanted desert so we ordered room service. I was put on hold and had to wait for the \"Next available room service agent\" which actually took close to 10 minutes, something I've never experienced before. I ordered a bowl of berries normally on the breakfast menu. 2 minutes later, my wife wanted me to add a glass of milk to the order. I called back and they told me that would be fine. However, when the order arrived, there was no milk. My wife decided to forget about it. We chose the hotel #1 because I could get it free with my Starwood points and #2 because we were going to a taping of the Price is Right and also wanted to tour Hollywood. The hotel is a is in a good location to all of these things as we got lost trying to find CBS Television City at 5:30 am, but still managed to get there in time. The restaurant, Breeze, is excellent. They are supposedly known for their sushi, which I had. It was very good, but I've had better. I live in San Diego where I have my pick of about 50 sushi restaurants within a 10 mile radius, so I know sushi. The prices are typical LA prices if not a little on the cheaper side if possible. My wife ordered Filet Mignon which came with a nice portion of mashed potatoes and spinach which cost $32. All in all, I found the hotel to be enjoyable and in a decent location if you are planning on visiting Hollywood and/or Beverly Hills.", "Date": "March 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hyatt Regency Century Plaza", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d76442-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_Century_Plaza-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$234 - $460*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2025 Ave of the Stars</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90067</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "76442", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/f9/f0f9470d5a81e440c16f5ed6fecd1f4a4large.jpg"}}

The main reason why I stay here is because the road it's on connects to the BLUE ROUTE. If you're a local (or you frequent Branson) then you know that the traffic is HORRIBLE on the main strip. If you stay in a location that connects to the back roads of Branson, you will save HOURS of time sitting in traffic. (And if you don't know about the back roads, then do your homework before you go or get a Branson map when you arrive.) So, the location is great. The hotel is not. If you're on a budget, it works. There is an outdoor pool for the kids. You are within a short walk of the Hollywood Wax Museum, The Titanic exhibit and places to eat. You get free breakfast. In Branson, you're not going to spend much time in your hotel room. If you can stand the old hotel with horrible beds for a few nights, then book here.

The wedding was in the late afternoon and after driving all day to get there, I knew I would have to shower beforehand. I called the hotel the night before to ensure that I would be able to check in with enough time to get ready for the event. The clerk told me that check-in was at 1:00, but I might be able to get in earlier. I showed up to the hotel at about 11:00 and was told by the desk clerk that she would not know if our room was ready until the room service attendants returned from their lunch break. So, I went to lunch and came back at 12:30. When I returned to ask about the room the hotel manager, Jeremy, was behind the desk with the clerk. I asked again if the room was ready. The desk clerk began to call to housekeeping, when the manager cut her off and rudely told her not to bother because the room service attendants were busy. He didn't even look up from the computer he was typing on, while he very rudely told me that check-in was not until 3:00. I explained my situation, that I needed to be at a wedding in a couple hours and was told the night before I could check in at 1:00. His demeanor was extremely unprofessional and rude throughout the entire conversation. He was not helpful or sympathetic to my situation in any way. And he was wearing tattered jeans and a flannel shirt, not the attire of a competent hotel manager. I ended up sitting in the lobby for an hour and a half until the room was finally ready. The only saving grace was Tammy, the front desk clerk, who was very helpful and polite throughout the ordeal, despite also being treated rudely by the manager. Then to top it all off, the next morning my room was called by the front desk a half hour before check-out, asking if I was going to leave soon! Jeremy, I hope you read this and take to heart that in a hospitality industry, during rough economic times, if you continue treating your guests like they are a bother to you and belittling them, you will be jobless very soon!", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salina, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth the Money\u201d", "Author": "Breniam", "ReviewID": "UR134872868", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights last week.

The pool was ok, but when a selling point is that you have two hot tubs, and you don't tell customers that when they book their stay, it comes across as extremely shady. Breakfast: One of the reasons we selected this hotel was because their website lists a breakfast in the morning which inluded hot waffles, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, donuts, cereal, etc. This would allow us to save a few bucks on breakfast Sunday morning.

Moving on to the pool and play area there was broken glass all around the play area and on the cement area around the pool also they have 2 out door hot tubs that are non working and are somewhat covered with standing water and junk in them. Our son helped us get locked out of our room so my dear husband went down to the desk to see if he could get a key and the person working the desk was very rude and insisted on his id which he didn't have cause we had just come from the pool and who takes their wallet to swim????? Oh now let's discuss the ice machines, if you can call them that. They do not work properly at all they maybe spit out 5 cubes if you stand there forever, and that was us trying both machines in the building. Also I took my daughters to the pool on sat evening and there were smokers in the pool my kids have allergies and can not be around that, not to mention that it is just rude. Also the tv is junk it buzzes and there are maybe 20 channels. The water in the shower does not get very hot, we had it turned all the way to the hot and it was just right for my son, not for us older ones that I like it a little warmer.

Before we walked out, the gentleman dialed the room we were suppose to stay in and someone else answered the phone! How scary would it have been had we walked in on someone else!! Totally dissapointed with the way this was handled. No apology, just asked to give us the keys and assigned another room. Once we were settled, it was after midnight before we fell asleep. We were woken up at 5:00 with a wake-up call, which we never requested. Traveling with 3 others and a baby, this call disturbed everyone and it was difficult to get back to sleep. The next morning, we went to the so-called breakfast. What a joke!! A bunch of cereal and a few donuts. Was again disappointed with what was advertised on the website. I expected something more. If I had known about the breakfast, I would have gladly paid a little more to stay someone that provided more of a breakfast. That evening, we had been out of the room for approximately 3 hours, when we were called by an employee, who said the dog we had was barking. I apologized and told her we would be right there. She immediately accused me of lying about having a dog. She said that when she checked us in, she had asked me point blank if I had a dog and I supposedly told her no. I told her that she hadn't checked me in, it was a gentleman, and said that I wrote on my paper there was a dog during our stay. She continued to yell at me and demanded that I was a liar. This was quite frustrating and on Sunday, when the manager arrived, I explained the situation, and my disappointment for the way I was treated. He merely said \"Sorry\" and nothing else. I didn't expect anything in return, but more of an apology, instead of a simple one word response would have been nice. This place was a horrible experience and I will never return.

Folks, there is one \"nice\" hotel in the area, and it is attached to the convention center. Otherwise, regardless of where you stay you get the same basic two bed box with a bathroom.

The breakfast was always good every morning and there weren't long lines of people in your way for waffles or food, etc... there was a big selection of food. If you do stay ask to stay in the first building across from the lobby and stay at the FRONT side of that building or your view sucks. Your just staring at buildings otherwise and walking to the strip will be impossible because the hill to the other buildings is tremendous. Negatives... our toilet broke the first time we sat on it so for half the trip the seat would slide off when trying to use it. They later fixed it. The rooms are quite small and the beds are made Ill give them that. However, carpets are stained and dreary, the walls of our bathroom were stained, there was mold on the bathroom wall by the shower, not what you want to see first thing in the a,m. It doesn't get you pumped up for the day. Next, the pools were broken. The main pool was freezing, which works great during the day when its torching hot but at night no one wants to go back frozen. All the pools were actually dirty though. There were bugs in them and then some kids thought it was funny to throw trash from the cans into them so it was pretty filthy. Instead of swimming there we paid thirty bux for wristbands to get into the watermark at another hotel. The hot tub lights didn't work either so at night you could slip in there as the pool area is not lit. Lastly, while we stayed there were two basketball teams there who engulfed the place. They were screaming, running rampant, and playing rock music louder than a live concert. We have two babies, NOT working for sleep. I think hotels should tell you if they have bookings of large groups of wild teenagers. All in all, we tried to get another hotel while we were there but could find one available.

In all honesty i would never consider another howard johnson hotel unless they really step up there game. from now on I will stay with la quinta inn, best western, or econo lodge have never had a bad experiance there!!!", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shirley, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Home Away From Home\u201d", "Author": "Sam31922", "ReviewID": "UR69508206", "Content": "Our stay at Howard Johnson Motel in Branson MO. was wonderful.

This meant that the mattress pad and possibly sheets had not been changed from the previous guests before we checked in. I contacted the fron desk immediately around 9:45am and was assured that somebody would either remove the stain or the mattress would be replaced. We left the hotel and returned around 4:30pm that afternoon and the room and mattress had not been cleaned. I contacted the front desk again and they seemed bothered that I had called twice and was assured that housekeeping was still working and they guaranteed that the room would be cleaned. We went out and saw a couple of shows and got back to the room just a few minutes before 11:00pm and found that the room nor mattress had been cleaned. I contacted the front desk for the third time and explained that the room had not been cleaned and the mattress was still stained. She told me that on the check list for housekeeping, it was checked that the room had been cleaned, at which point I asked her to come see it for herself which she denied. She proceeded to tell me that there was nothing that could be done since housekeeping had already left for the day, only after I got extemely persistent did she agree to bring me clean sheets and towels for the room. She got to our room around 45 minutes later and dropped the sheets and towels off but had to get back to the front desk. We had to flip the mattress ourself and make the bed and pile all of the used towels and dirty sheets and blankets ourself. The next morning when I asked the Asst. Manager Manya Wingard for a card for Jay Wilson whom I was told is the owner of this Howard Johnson due to a complaint of bad service we had received, she gave me his card and said Jay would be the one to talk to and she then proceeded to walk away without even attempting to hear what I had to say. I did contact Jay Wilson at the number on the card and Manya Johnson answered the phone.

It is not directly on the strip, it is off the way a little bit, but still within walking distance of everything we wanted to do! We were probably one block away from the Titanic Museum, Hollywood Wax Museum, and White Water!! There were also two ways to get to the hotel, one put you directly on the Branson strip, and the other was a more traffic free route that took you to whitewater and also to the strip!! The pool was also amazing! It was nice to have the kids pools connected to the big one, so that we could all enjoy swimming together, without being too far away from one another!! All in all, I have to say that the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful whenever we had questions, it was located in the perfect place, not too close to all the traffic, but not so far away that you have to drive forever to get to anything, and the rooms and amenities were superb.

The hotel is in a great location -- close enough to walk to the main drag and featured attractions, yet very quiet and peaceful with trees on a quiet road. The front-desk staff was great at check-in -- had our requested room (non-smoking with queen beds) ready, yet were immediately willing to meet our on-site request to have a top floor (4 floors in each unit). We were always able to park right next to the elevator. Breakfasts were included and ample, with a very sweet attendant who said she loved her job, and it showed. The room was fine. Not luxurious, but a cut above the norm -- clean, free of any smells (I'm sensitive to smoke, mold, heavy fragrances -- none there). Our son enjoyed the pool, and we liked the convenience of the courtesy PC available for Web, e-mail and even printing right in the lobby. Since we used our cell phones while there for calls and even wake-up alarms, we didn't realize until the last day that our room phone wasn't working. We mentioned it at checkout, and the management was very responsive and said they would have been glad to fix it had they known.

Maintenance staff does not report to work until 8 a.m. Management doesn't show up until 9 or later. One morning is one thing, but twice in a row is something else. It all but ruined our trip!! If you want to enjoy Branson I would look hard to insure that you find a hotel that is kept up to date and provides the very basics, like hot water. Their marquee sign read \"hot waffles\", didn't mention no hot showers!! The HOWARD JOHNSON is in basic poor repair, very dated, and the rooms are anything but clean.

No one should be put in rooms like that, it is a definite health hazard! The breakfast was disappointing also, the 'bus' people who were to eat in the next room were coming over and getting waffles. In the process they broke one of the waffle irons and went out with enough bananas and apples to supply them for a day! Overall we felt we really got ripped off, would never stay there again and we inform any one we know what our stay was like.

Our reservation was for three nights, but we shortened it to only two because the carpet in our room was absolutely filthy. It felt as if someone had spilled syrup ALL over it. Our shoes literally stuck to the carpet when we walked on it. We were also disappointed with the desk staff. We always enjoy asking the locals for their recommendations on events and restaurants, but the reception desk employees seemed to not even know the area themselves, and they seemed annoyed that we would ask them about the area. Another disadvantage of this hotel is that it is built on an incline. Everything slants..... so when you walk through the parking lot or park your car there, be ready to hike it. The only good thing about this room was that it was close to the main strip...only one block.

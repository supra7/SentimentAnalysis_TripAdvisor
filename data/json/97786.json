The casino was fine but I'm not much of a gambler. It's definitely not the glitz & glam hotel that others are but we didn't want to pay glitz & glam prices. Also, got a mani/pedi in the Spa (using a coupon from the coupon book we got when we checked in) while here and Holly did a very nice job. And for some yummy food for dinner, check out the Lynard Skynard BBQ restaurant....it was soooo good. It serves a little differently than most restaurants but the food was great!

Clean hotel, wonderful and courteous service, great views of the strips, etc. The rooms are just as big as any other hotel. Tower2 has been remodeled and I loved the over-sized showers! The breakfast buffet in this hotel is not very good but other than that everything was VERY conveniently located. The casino gives a good vibe of people just wanting to have fun. The smell of cigarette smoke bothered me a little in the casino but overall LOVED IT! The pool was recently remodeled and I loved relaxing during the day there. NUMBER ONE place go to for food and entertainment later at night is Lynard Skynard's BBQ at the Excalibur. They have PERFECT comfort food...and after eating crappy food from every other expensive place we went..Lynard Skynard's BBQ was heaven! They have Karaoke at night and we couldn't have had any more fun anywhere else...and we don't even sing. They have free-shot times too. Make sure to pick up a few free drink tickets from the guys that stands outside in the casino. There is time-share people at the hotel and several others you walk in and out of.

There was a group of 4 people in 2 rooms and we all stayed in Tower 1 on the 4th floor for 10 nights. This was all booked through my local Thomson travel agent. We arrived at the hotel at around 4:30pm and went straight through to check in, no queue at all even though the hotel was busy however the lady who checked us in was not the friendly of people... A lot of reviews on the site say that the Excalibur is 'one of the most smokiest hotels on the strip'... Personally, I smoke and did not find it any better or any worse than any other hotel on the strip. The other 3 people in our party agreed and they are non smokers. The only hotels you do not tend to notice any smell of smoke is Bellagio, Venetian and Palazzo. The hotel itself is dated but asw are many others, having stayed here before I knew what to expect and this was a factor in booking here as although the rooms are basic, they are large, clean and cheap. And besides... Who comes to Las Vegas to stay in their hotel room? When we arrived the 4 of us were also expecting to pay the $15 a day resort fee. When we enquired to reception about this we were told it had all been pre-paid in the cost (so a little tip to UK residents... Maybe speak with your local travel agent when booking and see if they also include the resort fee) As it was all pre-paid we got everything that guests who pay on arrival get apart from 2 free drinks per person per day... Nothing to really worry about. There was no evidence of bed bugs in the hotel room and the room itself was always kept spotless. The beds themselves were very comfortable and the room also featured a decent sized plasma/LCD television. The buffet on offer in the food court is of very good value. All you can eat for a day in either Excalibur or Luxor was offered for $32. As we did not spend much time in the hotel we only had the breakfast buffet 2 mornings for $15 and oon day of leaving we went to the lunch buffet for $16. All 3 times we only went to the Excalibur buffet. The food was very tasty and with all drinks included it works out as a very good saving. There was plenty of choice and food was replenished regularly... If you struggled to find something then you must be to fussy for a buffet. One problem we did have with the hotel was that on the night of the 17th/morning on 18th of March we had the fire alarm set off at 4:30am by some drunken 'idiots' to put it nicely. The same thing happened aat 11:30pm on the night of the 18th March. I reckon the reason for this was due to it being St. Patrick's Day Weekend as we saw many, MANY people who had overindulged on alcohol - but it is Vegas! so why not! The alarms were checked by security promptly and they were swiftly checking all corridors and came back to answer any questions that the guests had. So really this was through no fault of the hotel. All in All I would definately return to the Excalbiur for the price paid and what you get is more than adequate. I would say that yes this hotel is cheap, dated and not as dazzling as some hotels on the Strip but you can not expect a 5* hotel for cheap prices. The timeshare people can get annoying asking you everytime you pass wether you want discount/free tickets or wether you are returning next year and they can get you free rooms/discounts etc etc... If you go along with these I have no sympathy if you spend your day with a timeshare... We just kept on walking, said no thank you if they approached us and asked or just avoided eye contact. If they annoy you too then do the same! *** Now About Vegas*** During our time in Las Vegas I overheard many parents commplaining about Las Vegas not being very Child focused... Las Vegas is not designed for kids. Most people must surely realise that?!? Just my own thought... The bus services are well worth doing to get around Vegas. its $7 for 24 hours and can be brought on the Deuce bus... Only if you have the correct change in $Bills. However at all stops there are either credit card machines or machines that take card, cash and coins. Be warned though... They do tend to be very busy but the deuce ones run 24 hours every 10-20minutes. The Premium outlet mall: We went to both the North and the South Premium outlet malls by taking the Strip & Downtown Express (SDX) bus. The north outlet mall is much better than the south - more shops, more choice and is an outdoor one whereas the south one is roofed. Penn & Teller: We saw their show at the Rio hotel - Would totally recommend this show. We paid extra to get 'VIP' tickets. This resulted in 2nd row seats and a free souvenier brochuere. It was a great show and there is an oppertunity for all guests to meet them both outside the thearte after the show (You may have a wait though). Mirage Secret Garden: 2 of us from our group done the 'Trainer for a Day' Programme that is on offer at the secret garden exhibit at the Mirage Hotel. It is pricey at $550 per person but this includes breakfast, lunch and a day interacting and swimming with the dolphins. Aswell as as souvenier photos. Helicopter Strip Tour: We booked our trip through 'HeliUSA'. It lasted around 15mins onboard the helicopter but the view of the strip/fremont street was amazing! Fremont Street & Stratosphere: We done both in one afternoon/evening. First we went up to the top of the Stratosphere which offers great views from all around then went via the bus to Fremont Street.

(The alternative for about the same price was the Stratospere which is much older and at the raggedy north end of the strip.) By going during the week (Check in Monday, Check out Friday) we got rock bottom prices of 29 per night (tho be aware of the additional 15 per day \"resort fee.\") Still less than a Motel 6. We took a shuttle from the airport for 7 one way. (You can save 2 on a round trip but we had an early flight back and needed to take a taxi on the way home. Cab supposedly was 18-20) The shuttle sat around for a while until it was full then visited several hotels on the east side of the strip before finally getting to our hotel. (There are several different shuttles so look for one that is almost full so you won't have to wait very long.) They let you off in the back of the hotel and you have to walk through the whole very-smoky casino to get to the registration desk. The desk is not isolated from the casino so you have to breathe second hand smoke the whole time you wait in line. Luckily the line was short and moved fairly quickly. (You will be met by an official looking person who wants to give you a welcome gift. This is a time share salesman so blow them off and get in line before the other people on the shuttle get there. If you are really up to sitting through a long high pressure sales talk you can go talk to them later.) We asked for and were given a renovated non-smoking room without an extra charge. We were in 4222 but the card they gave us said Tower II, Floor 4, Room 22 with left us a little confused especially since the first time we tried 4222 the key didn't work. (Maybe we were a bit faster than the computer?). The way to Tower II leads through another long smoky area. We found later we can avoid most of the smoke by walking around the building to the left via the Valet/Taxi area. Much better for the lungs. (When you come down from the tower, go out the door and walk around to the right. Coming back in you come up the moving sidewalk and turn 180 degrees to the right and go back out the door then turn left.) The room was a pleasant surprise. Very clean. No smoke smell. Very comfortable beds. Nice TV. Free wired Internet. (The sign said the cable was behind the TV. It wasn't. Turned out it was behind the dresser under the TV.) Cable could have been longer. It was barely long enough to use while lying in bed. Bathroom was clean and looked new (though the shower head had a couple of calcium blocked outlets). Towels were nice and thick. On the negative side, the bedside lamp was so dim it was impossible to read the fine print on the telephone. The toilet was one of those like you find in a handicapped room. Not my favorite. The soap seemed rather harsh but it may have been the water or the dry air. The shampoo was the type with conditioner and didn't seem to work well. No coffee in the room but we knew that so brought an immersion heater, a filter holder, ceramic cups and coffee and made our own. (Room only has thin plastic disposable cups.) There was coffee available at the base of the tower - Mornings we often saw several people staggering into the elevator on their trek for coffee. Not sure if there was a charge for it or not. Reading the fine print of the check-in paperwork I found we were supposed to get a free newspaper. Turns out you have to pick it up at the little store at the base of the tower. Just show your room key and pick up a USA Today. Would have been nice if they had told us that. We also got two tickets to the buffet as part of the package. They said Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner on them but when we called to see when dinner started, we were told we had to get them signed by a manager or they wouldn't be valid for dinner. This seemed to be news to the manager but she did sign them for us. The buffet is reached from an escalator in the middle of the casino floor so you have to hold your breath and rush to the escalator. Taxi to the airport was only 12.75 plus tip so not a bad deal. Typically taxis that pick up at the airport have to pay a bit fee to the airport for the privilege which explains the 18-20 we were quoted at the airport. Would we stay there again?

As a single mom, I finally had the opportunity to take my children on a cheap family vacation. I choose this hotel for two reasons: It looked like a castle and it was cheap. Our first night was fine, but at 2 am on the second night, my mom discovered there were bed bugs! She called to notify the front desk and they sent a security guard to our room to inspect it. He took a statement from my mom and took the bug that she trapped in a tissue to show them. When we voiced our concerns about our personal belongings, he suggested that we place them in trash bags. I told him, that we refuse to carry these pests with us home and from what I have heard, bed bugs are extremely hard to get rid of. We asked him if we could get a copy of the report that my mom had to sign and he refused to give us a copy. Finally, after speaking with his co worker, he gave us a copy. The manager on duty asked us if we wanted to change rooms, initially we told her no (because if one room is infested, then I am sure the others are too.) After telling us that they needed the room for Ecolab, we told them that we were ok with being switched. We informed the manager that we were supposed to check out by 6 a.m. and we reminded her of this again when we decided to change rooms. They left us in that bug infested room for 3 hours until finally giving us a new room. It was 5 a.m. before we received the keys to a new room. There were bugs everywhere too!

I wouldn't say it is one of the top of the line hotels but, it is rather well maintained, easy on the pocketbook and offers a great deal more ambiance on the casino floor than the other hotels. The hotel consists of two towers, with Tower 2 being the more upgraded remodeled rooms. Either tower is fine with us but, we really prefer Tower 1 for the views of the city. The food court on the 2nd level has a fairly decent buffet. If you purchase the \"all day pass\" during the breakfast buffet, then you can eat all you want for the rest of the day (up until 10pm). There is also a moving walkway on the 2nd floor which leads you to the Luxor & Mandalay Bay hotels. This is a very convenient and air-conditioned walkway. Something you might want to consider when it's 100 degrees outside. In the other direction, you have the over street walkways leading to New York, New York and the MGM hotels. The Excalibur is a spa & resort hotel. Though the room rates are very inexpensive, be advised that there is a $14 a night resort fee added to your room fees. Don't let this deter you too much however. The pool & spa area to the Excalibur is really nice and since you are paying for it, take advantage of it! Overall; I recommend this hotel over the others nearby. The casino floor is what influences my stay here and the Excaliburs casino floor is always lively.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGo here for location, price, but not service...\u201d", "Author": "Disconation", "ReviewID": "UR126524063", "Content": "Stayed here with my girlfriend and her family they were from Mexico and non English speakers so we were pretty much the interpreters front desk staff had short patience as well as bartenders but it was clean and location was great...

Many visitors to Excalibur mentioned that Tower II had been renovated so I asked for a 'widescreen' room with a view on a upper floor of Tower II. I don't know about the rest of Tower II but floor 26 has NOT been renovated. Our room was worn, dingy and greatly in need of repair. Also, one of the reasons I stayed there was they sent me an offer for $25 for the night. It turned out that my request of a view room raised the price to $60+ and also had an additional room tax and a $15 resort fee added on.

Since you are tethered to the table by the Ethernet cable it would be nice if there was an electrical outlet close by. The room had recently been updated and the ice bucket was brand new. The reason I know it is brand new is that the plastic used to protect the handle from scratches was still in place where it was taped to the handle. When we first arrived, the bathroom lights did not work. We called the front desk to inquire and they said, oh, the GFI in the bathroom must be tripped. So, can anybody explain how the housekeeper did not know this or fix it. The GFI does not trip without a cause and it should not have been an issue. We were there for 5 nights and the plastic was never removed from the ice bucket eventhough it was moved to its proper location EVERY DAY by the house keeper. So, would I stay there again? Maybe. But, if you are there and don\u2019t have any plans to do any work while there, absolutely consider it. I work nonstop so I am a bit more focused on issues which affect my ability to get work done.

In an effort to perhaps encourage some other choices for us, I mentioned that it was our anniversary and was greeted with a congratulations and what room would you like reply. Nothing resulted from this and so we took the 7th floor room which was actually a good choice. Very quiet floor and location. The room faced west and we had a view of the swimming pool, mountains and the parking lot. The room was clean in all manner. However, even though it was considered renovated, it still looked old and tired. The desk chair had old golden colored courdory material. The lighting was also dark even with 3 lights on. That could have been caused by the color scheme of the walls and carpet - dark browns and tans. The grating/cover over the AC/heating unit was already broken at one corner. The bathroom was a high point. It only had a shower but it was very clean. Housekeeping did a very good job - no complaints on this service. The overall appearance of the hotel gave it a tired expression. The casino smelled of smoke but this smell did not reach up to our room on the 7th floor. Trying to get to our elevator was always a challenge because we had to walk past the employees trying to get you to take a tour of the time-share property advocated by the hotel. Just a nuisance. Of note, the elevators appeared to never have been cleaned while we were there. They were always dirty. As mentioned, our stay was only average. We chose this hotel due it's location and the cost.

After our previous night in at the Stratasphere we were relieved to find a much better quality room and service. Beds were comfortable, shower was good (no bath tub) and bathroom spacious. I liken the room quality in decor and amenities to the standard newer Sheraton rooms. Regretfully we were only on the 4th floor and looking at a brick wall but since we were there for business and on a last moment booking we tolerated it. All of these older hotels seem to have window air conditioning units in the room, this one was tastefully disguised beneath a granite counter top. They buffet dinner was compulsorily included (meaning you paid extra for it in the room booking anyway) but it was actually pretty darn good! We also ate at \"Dick's\" in the casino and thought that would be a great place to return with a group that just wanted to kick it up a notch - good fun - food was basic, mostly fried but tasty. Either they accidentally gave us the pot smoking floor or they spray a pot scented air freshner in the hallways, greatfully the room smelt fine and not smokey or even funky. We could hear the people in the neighboring room and hallway, it was not overly loud but I guess it's hard to escape this in Vegas. Oh the free internet ... it's ethernet/cable and it's slower than treacle, you are supposed to get a newspaper and free local & 1800 calls. We didn't pick up the phone and we never saw a newspaper - they charge a compulsory $17 for this. Check in was slow, check out was slower ... like an hour standing in line. This was low season, there were only 3 or 4 people working the front desk with 200 people in line. Bring a book/kindle/chair on rollers, take turns with other members in your party at standing in line then play a few slots while waiting. Hotels should really do something about this unnecessary standing in line nonsense. Staff were professionally attired, we were greatful not to be exposed to too much cleavage on the vulgar side, muffin tops or unsightly thighs of women who really shouldn't be sharing. FYI - you WILL be harassed by time share sellers at the Tower II entrance every time you walk by. As far as casinos and pokies go ... this isn't too bad, not seedy like some others can be.

We did have the odd issue, they were not major, but I guess the fact that they didn't really seem to care that they were an issue was the thing that got you..Lets start with the fact that when we booked, we booked 4 rooms for 4 nights. We asked that they be as close together as possible. When we arrived. 2 rooms on the 21st floor, 2 on the 23 rd. Not really together, but it was all they could do to get us on the same floors 2 at a time. It took extra time at check in to get what we got so we didn't push it. Next the resort fees. 12.50 a day plus 1.50 tax I'll bet the Gov never sees...... for internet that rarely works and a paper we never got. Informed at check out we were supposd to get them from the stands at the base of the elevators. And we would know this how? any hotel i've ever stayed at drops them at your door...... next, the whole place decided that after super bowl, they may as well shut down or reno as much as they could as the people there that week were not that important. Lounge closed for reno, no entertainment.Tournament of kings, closed. Pool bar and resteraunt, open sunday, closed the rest of the week. Dicks has entertainment sunday, none the rest of the week. Supposed to open for breakfast, barely open by 10:30. supposed to be open till late at night, done by 10 pm. One other item while talking pools, do you really need to close at 5 and even then, could you not just leave the hot tubs open for the adults to use in the evening? The next thing is the time share salespeople are getting to be too much. We were asked at least 10 times a day if we were staying at the resort or wanted to see a free show, usually by the same 2 people. I guess the bright side is that the hotel knows they were doing their job. Lastly, the hotel needs a good update but especially a cleaning. The kids ran around a bit on the pool deck in bare feet and it was a full time job for our daughter to try to get them clean again......... Filthy. We are return customers to this hotel, at least 3 different times, but this was probably it.

We picked this hotel because it was cheap, but didn't expect it to be as awful as it was.

I paid $20 to upgrade our room and we ended up having the same room as 4 other people we were with, who paid less than we did. I asked the person at the front desk about it and they couldn't have cared less and said that I could talk to the supervisor about it but that they probably wouldn't change our room or take away the fee. I walked away. A week before we were flying to Vegas, I called the hotel and told them that we had 24 people coming (including us) and asked if there was any sort of transportation or anything that they had to get us all from the airport to the hotel. I told them that I would be happy to pay for it. They told me no, their limos are reserved for the high rollers. Ok, I can handle that. I asked if we could have a limo to transport everyone to my wedding that was Saturday, again, no, you're not a high roller. So, I said ok, thanks and hung up. The beds are hard, the rooms smell funny and don't appear to be incredibly clean. There were no blankets on the beds, just double sheets. We asked for a King bed, and was told that they don't have King beds available. Really? I don't need 2 beds. I had to steal the double sheets off of the other queen sized bed in our room so i didn't freeze to death because the heater was less than adequate. The people at the front desk are rude and they don't seem happy to have a job, or your business. I told them we were getting married and I got a oh, that's nice. No congrats or anything. The casino is really smoky, not like the other casinos. There is an overwhelming smell of fake rose perfume that's in the entry way that made me want to gag everytime I came in the door.

They put our bags on a cart and when we were ready to leave they brought our bags to the curb and hailed a taxi for us and loaded them. Checkout was a different story.

My husband gives it a 3.5 stars I give it a 4. Likes: One thing we do agree upon, this hotel (side vendors) are cheaper than the south side of the strip hotels (TI, Bellagio, Ceasar Palace, Mirage...etc.), such as, cigarettes, water, liquor bottles... etc. There were tram rails and over pass connecting to other hotels... so you didn't have to battle with other people on the strip and it was INCREDIBLY convenient. We stayed on the 3rd floor and the music and smoke didn't bother us any. The bed was comfortable and to our knowledge their were no signs of bed bugs :). Big hotel... lots of room to gamble, easy to get lost. The hotel workers were nice. Dislikes: We do agree that the buffet was not worth visiting. If you desire to eat at a buffet that is less expensive try the Luxor was very good for breakfast and dinner. The payout on our gambling was poor at Excalibur. We left tips for house keeping and they were nice and good; however, in the hallway we saw dishes that accumulated from when we checked in and by the item we checked out. The elevators' carpet was dirty all the time. Keep in mind... that if you want house keeping to change your bed linen every day you must place a house keeping card on your bed every day to indicate you want it changed. We gambled a lot of money and did not get many free drinks on the gambling floor. The worst part of Excalibur and Luxor is the pestering \"time share\" people (GrandView Hotel). I guess, they are able to be inside Excalibur and Luxor verses compared the other hotels. Just ignore them when you see them, don't get bothered when you are on vacation!

Ours was fine, nothing fancy, but fine. The pools were great, although due to the time of year, we didn't get to swim but one day. We would have loved to spend more time at the pools if weather permitted. Be sure to take a tour of Hoover Dam (very cool - kids loved it too) an d go to the Grand Canyon. We went to the West rim due to time (only about a 2 hr 15 min drive). Just expect a hefty price to see the canyon... it's on private Indian property... but so worth it if you've never been before. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay & would stay here again with kiddos (BTW, ours were 9 & 6).

Rooms that are out dated and unclean is not my cup of tea. Check in was decent, fast. Staff was polite. Our room was in Tower 2 with the pool. When we got to the elevators the tile and nice walls really got excited as to how the updated room would look. We were on the 27th floor rm 27237. Keys to room worked the first time, that was a plus. But when we opened the door it was a HUGE let down. First the overall size. Soo small. It was supposed to hold a king size bed and we wondered how, this brings me to my second upset. It was supposed to be a widescreen room with a KING bed. What we had was a QUEEN! Thirdly the picture clearly shows us a modern up-to-date room. The sheets (there was no cover over top) had tears, holes, and they were not changed the entire time we were there. The dresser was chipped and the carpet was dirty. The blue pillow looked like it was on it's last legs with stains and dirt. That should not be on a bed!! Now the widescreen tv was a plus however, when you have a tv that is supposed to have hd channels on regular cable it looks pixelated at best. The least they should have done is calibrated the tv so it would not look so fuzzy. As to a lot of people having the problem of stealing in the hotel, I had none, I did take extra precautions with my luggage. Using locks on the bags and anything that I knew would be a huge loss to me if taken was in a carry-on that I took with me.\u00a0 Now for some positives. The view of the strip from our room was spectacular! You could see the whole strip from our room! Pool was nice, heated and open to use. I love to walk so being a little far from everything was not a problem, even if a person was tired there was always taking the trams. We had asked for a late checkout which did cost money however if we didnt have to get ousted by 11 it was great. Late checkout is at 3pm. Now for the buffets/ food. The food buffets at Excalibur and Luxor were so HORRIBLE I would never serve that \u00a0to my dog!! It tasted horrible! it definitely looked as though it had been left out for 3hrs or more. As for food elsewhere on the strip, Denny's was tried, but they brought a glass of grapefruit juice and web I got halfway down I noticed the glass was completely stained aka DIRTY. Margaritaville was a nice venue except for service. 20mins sitting at a table waiting for our server to come to the table. She came 3 times. Once to take our drink order and by that time we had already figured out what we wanted and ordered food as well. Second was when we were just about finished to ask how the food was. And to take the bill away as we left. \u00a0As a sidenote: make sure when you take a taxi you know where you need to go and what route to take as if you don't they will take you for a ride. \u00a0Other than noted I had a great trip, but due to the price and out dated rooms available, I will not be back.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Republic, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood time at Excalibur\u201d", "Author": "sushifarmer", "ReviewID": "UR123880255", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights from Jan. 13th-15th.

I had booked a trip from Thursday evening to Tuesday evening. The primary hotel I was planning to stay at was ridiculously priced for that Thursday evening. Knowing that I was not landing in Vegas until 10:30pm and having to check out by 11am, it didn't make sense to pay over $149 for that evening. Instead, I decided to book the first night's stay at Excalibur. I had booked a Widescreen room. It was nothing fancy. A comfortable bed, decent bathroom, and a flat screen TV. For those that have never stayed at the Excalibur previously, the widescreen room are the newer/renovated rooms. I wouldn't recommend staying at the older rooms. For $55 a night, there's nothing really much to complain about. If you're looking for fancy, this is not the room or hotel for you. If you want a decent place to crash while you're checking out the Vegas strip, then this is a great rate and decent stay. The staff is very nice and friendly. You barely had to wait in line before you're attended to. If you have an MGM player's card, you can use it while gambling at the Excalibur (as it's an MGM property). The casino is not as smokey as some of the others at night. There's lots of slots and table games for the people looking to gamble. I believe the daily poker tournament buy in is only $30 or $35. If you want to grab a drink, Dick's Last Resort within the hotel is a fun place to grab some food and/or drink. The hotel has a walkway to the Luxor hotel so you don't have to go outside. There is an overpass to go to the New York New York hotel. From New York New York, there is also an overpass to go to MGM Grand. The vending machines in the hotel typically charge a ridiculous $3 for a bottle of water or pop. What I typically do is walk to the Walgreens (on the strip) just past the MGM Grand and get my drink/snacks for the room. Much much cheaper if you're staying a few days. For those who want to explore the strip without cabbing everywhere, there is a Monorail within the MGM Grand. You can typically purchase single ride or all day passes. The hotel is very close to McCarran airport. So, you don't have to leave too early to head to the airport. You can typically get there within 10 minutes by cab. Overall, I have no problem recommending this hotel to someone just looking for decent to cheaply priced stay on the strip. I would sooner recommend this hotel before the Luxor (as its rooms have been aging). The Excalibur renovated rooms (Widescreen room) are more than decent for the less picky. If you're looking for a luxurious/fancy hotel/hotel room experience, then you need to look at other options towards the middle of the strip.

Absolutely perfect, no complaints whatsoever. My last stay was at the MGM Suites and apart from the kitchen facilites I missed nothing. The Excalibur was a perfect resort and I enjoyed my stay. I am not sure what the rooms are like in Tower 1, but I have posted 3 pics of my room in Tower 2 and it was large, clean and well-appointed. There was no smell of smoke on our floor, the casino floor is very smoky but that is normal for all the casinos we visited in Vegas. I would have to say that Excalibur had one of the best Casinos, packed with people and lots of fun. There is a resort fee of $12 per day but that includes wired internet access in your room so I didn't mind it too much. Note: Most of the negative reviews seem to be people staying in Tower 1, as you can see from the pics of my room it was modern and tastefully furnished. Tips: There is no kettle, coffee maker or any bar fridge in the rooms. Therefore its not possible to make a cuppa tea or store perishable snacks. You can buy water in the Excalibur for $5 per litre, or just walk up the strip a block to either the CVS or Walgreens where you buy a gallon for $2. Its cheaper to buy the 2 day all you can eat buffet pass than trying to pay for individual meals, in truth you end up paying more if you don't eat at the buffets. The best buffet we had was the MGM, thumbs down on both the Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay.

We paid extra for a view, which was pretty good. The hotel itself (lobby, casino etc) felt dated but was acceptable - Circus Circus, for example, felt a lot seedier. The food was pretty bad, and my advice is to eat elsewhere - the food in their restaurants was very mediocre. Service was generally complacent and bordered on rude at times, from the receptionists, to the waitresses. It seems that as they have such a high turnover rate and few repeat customers, they don't seem to care. Also, as the hotel is so huge and has so many rooms, the lines to check in are proportional - though this is probably common in Vegas.

Now the room itself was a standard two bed queen room, only showers, and no tub, which is ok but after several hours of touring it would have been nice to come back to the room and soak my tired feet.

The room is basic, picture a La Quinta or Days Inn, minus the nice amenities like fridge, microwave, coffee maker, breakfast - the Excalibur provides none of these because they want you to buy all your food at the overpriced restaurants. We tried the breakfast buffet; you get plenty of choices but all are bland and dull, classic American diner stuff without much flavor. Room was clean and quiet, but everything was run down, a plugged up sink, non-functional safe, stained bedding, hole in the bathroom ceiling. No bugs though. The worst part of our stay IMO was the absolute lack of information. There was no guest info in the room, other than a few ads, but nothing about transportation, restaurants outside MGM, and no friendly faces to ask for tips.

We were given a room in Tower 1. When we arrived, we found that it was the old furniture and not a rennovated room like in Tower 2 or 3. I recommend that you request these rooms instead of Tower 1. First of all, there was ONE trash can to be found. There were no other trash cans in the bathroom. Also, everytime you sit on the toilet, the seat moves off to the side and the seat cover bangs down on your back...flimsy to say the least! Another annoying thing about our experience at this hotel was how slow the housekeeping took to clean our room. We had to call for service, left our room to eat lunch, and it was still not done! Highly inconvenient when you have little one's who want to take a nap. Our housekeeper finally did come late afternoon. Lastly, one of the reasons we decided to return here besides the location, was that it was kid-friendly and that there were carnival games. When we took the kids there Wednesday night, we noticed that they raised the prices of the games. Also, there were not enough attendants for the games so even if you wanted to play, you couldn't. Maybe because the holiday rush was done? We ended up going back to circus circus for some affordable fun.

Low priced and fast food options. 4)Kids. if you have kids/teens, the Fun Dungeon and DQ are a hit. Be aware that this is Vegas. Your kids are going to see things that you may not want them to see, either at your hotel or on the strip. 5) Staff. The staff was extremely responsive and friendly when we had a plumbing emergency. 6) Music at the Lynyrd Skynyrd. Check out the house band--they rock. Also, they have the cheapest drink options on the strip with no cover and NO smoke. Cons-- 1) Rooms. Once one of the largest hotels on the strip, the Ex is falling behind in rennovations. Stay in Tower II to get the upgraded rooms. 2) Check-in. We checked in immediately. However, we did see very long lines the next day for check-in. Depends on when you arrive. Things that are the same in hotels of this price in LV-- 1) Timeshare. You are going to be be approached in just about every moderately priced hotel in any resort in America by timeshare agents. There is no law that says you have to talk to them. Just walk by. 2) Smoke Cigarette smoking it is more noticable in a smaller casino like EX. If you don't want to be bothered by smoke, take the tram to Mandalay Bay--the casisno is so big you won't notice the smoke. 3) Long walks. If you stay at either end of the strip, it is a long walk to the middle (Casers, Bellagio). You can either walk and cut through the other casinos--which is the point--or take the very cheap bus $7 for 24 hours. Just make sure you exit the bus at the end of the strip or you will have a long wait to get back--the buses don't loop around. Remember--you get what you pay for.

First, the lack of parking - we managed to find a spot almost a mile away, and had to drag all our bags across the parking lot, as they were not allowing us to drop our bags off at the main gate (they had some equipment blocking the entry). Then the really long lines at check-in; this was at 11 am. The checkout lines were long, and there were only 3 counters open off the 14 in total. Due to this, guests wishing to checkout had caused a huge line. So they told everyone that there will be a separate line for checkin, and it will start at 11.30am. So all the guests started to form another line at the registration lobby, and this caused even more confusion. The checkin counters opened finally at 12.15pm (we had waited for an hour already) and finally our turn came at 12.45pm However, here we got an even bigger surprise - they had our reservation, and all details were correct. They even had our room - all good - but even after that, the staff member helping us was so slow that it took her 45 mins to check us into 2 rooms. She was not trying to be friendly or helpful or courteous by giving us more time - she was just slow. She had to ask for my details 6 times, and everytime there was some issue. By the end of it, i was frustrated, and I can only imagine the condition of the people waiting in line for checkin. Next, the room we got was ok - far from the elevator but that's fine by me. However, the towels & sheets were stained and the bathroom floors were dirty. We called and asked them to be replaced, and they said that the staff is preoccupied with the rush of guests and will replace it by the next round of house cleaning (and that never happened, as we were there only for a night). Finally, we went to the casino, it was normal - nothing great. We couldn't find a good low-minimum table and so we decided to hit the slots.

We played slots for 3 hours in the casino and never found a waitress to order a drink. I asked a bartender to send one over he said \"she was just covering a break\" and he never sent the next one. The casino was just dim, old, smokey and gross. The $38/2 special Christmas buffet was a huge disappointment!!! The food was lousy, and that's generous, and we're not that fussy.

We ate at the burger restaurant (ABX, I think it's called?) for breakfast and were underwhelmed. The breakfast sandwich I ordered was encased in two inches of tasteless, biscuit-like bread. But even that was good when compared to the buffet. The Excalibur buffet was the worst casino buffet we have ever experienced -- and we've eaten in a lot of them from Vegas, to Reno to Jackpot.

The hotel had good overall facilities that most of the Vegas hotels include, sports book, poker room, casino, food court, bar and specific shows/attractions.

I look at this way the maid should have picked up on many of these things when she turned the room over. I managed to get all but the sink sorted out the first day. The day I left they were to open two new restaurants which replaced the Sherwood Forest cafe. They look interesting. There was other reno work starting at the bar next to the lobby as well. They also replaced many slot machines while I was there with newer different ones. I would say they are trying on the upkeep but it is slow.

Emily at the front desk was very friendly. When I got to the room, the room was still dirty (there were empty bottles, cans, bags of chips, etc), I know mistakes happen especially on a busy day, so I used the phone in the room to call guest service to ask for a key to new room. The guest service agent on the phone, Wayne, did not show any interest in the situation and just told me to go down to the front desk. No apology for the situation. When I asked if somebody might be able to bring me a key so that I don't have to go down with all my luggage, he said it'll take 40minutes. It was not the fact that I had to go down or the fact that it takes 40 minutes for a new key, it was lack of sympathy or apology that made me feel not cared. so I went down to the front desk, and asked for a manager. The person who helped me was very understanding and apologized for the inconvenience, and offered me an upgrade. When I spoke to a manager, Denise (I believe that's her name was), I felt disappointed again. Instead of listening to my complaint that the guest service agent lack the customer service or listening skill, she told me that he is a very nice person but has a cancer and that is the reason why he sounded like that over the phone to me. I am very sorry for his situation,,.,he has a cancer, and maybe I talked to him on his worst day or the day he had his treatment, and yet, i just did not feel that she cared about customer service, rather, she was trying to justify the situation. All I wanted was a room that I can check-in that is clean, and I am very thankful that they accommodate me for an early check-in at noon, but I still wish that they had somebody who can listen rather than talk over me to justify their actions. other than that, my stay was great, the bed was comfortable, everything was clean, they have a food court that is very convenient to grab a quick bite. all other staff was very friendly, even the housekeepers on the floors were very friendly and welcoming. I am not big fan of their casino, as it is quite smokey and smells funny. The casino itself is nice and has bars and place to eat and place for kids to play, so for people who is ok with smoke/smell, this is a great option as it is a cheap accommodation compared to some hotels on the strip =)", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRight on the strip!

While there is no overwhelming reason why I don't recommend staying here, there is also no overwhelming reason why I would ever suggest that one check this place out, let alone stay in it. Although it is technically on the Strip, it is about as far south as it can get, with the exception of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay properties. If you only plan on hanging around the south end of the Strip, than this place might be for you, otherwise I would suggest that you pack a comfortable pair of walking shoes. One of the few positives about this hotel is the exterior design of the hotel. I have always found the Excalibur to be one of the coolest looking hotels on the Strip, but that is just my opinion, and others may not feel the same. The rooms themselves were not bad, but nothing special either. They come with standard amenities: 2 Queen or 1 King bed, flat-screen TV, small table with chairs, and a decent bathroom. The casino floor looks like any other run-of-the-mill casino, and has no features that really separate it from any others. It has a average selection of table games, and most of them run at $10+ limits throughout the day. They do have a pretty good selection of fast-dining options compared to others, however they are spread out through the hotel as opposed to being in a centralized food court. This can cause a minor inconvenience if one is not familiar with the hotel layout. The Excalibur also contains what I can confidently say is the WORST BUFFET in Las Vegas. Making the decision to dine at the Round Table Buffet was the only regret I had during my trip. The food quality and selection is comparable to food you can find in a high-school cafeteria. In fact, I actually would have preferred my high-school cafeteria food to the crap they served here, but I suppose I should save that for another review. In closing, if you are looking for a cheap place to stay for a few days, the Excalibur isn't the worst you can do. However, it is far from the best. For about the same price, I would suggest staying at somewhere like the Imperial Palace or Bally's due to a significantly better location.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!!\u201d", "Author": "mrsfreeze80", "ReviewID": "UR121239497", "Content": "We had a widescreen room on Tower 2.

Only had breakfast in the buffet, but it was good value for money ($18) and a good selection. Also great links to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, New York New York. Seriously for what you pay, you cant go worng in this hotel, and i will certaintly be going back here. By the way, other reports talk about time-share people around, i seen 2 in 5 days and wasnt approached once. No big deal.

The smoke smell wasn't as bad on the 14th floor but there were definitely some rooms smoking marijuana which stunk up the halls most days. The housekeeping was fairly basic. They made the beds and replaced towels when we needed them, but the ice bucket was always left full of water wherever it had been left the night before. Overall the rooms were comfortable, however the fan was difficult to control and you could never get a consistent temperature. Water pressure in the shower was also horrible. Annoying to only have wired internet as wi-fi would have been more convenient for those with iPods, etc. We didn't spend a lot of time in the casino, but it looked like most of the other casinos we went through. The whole place smelled like years of second hand smoke which we had been expecting anyway, but still gross. Tried the all you can eat buffet supper on our last night... Salads were good and plentiful. Everything was pretty classic buffet. Only really gross thing was the super dried out chicken that may as well have been jerky. Probably okay for $20 but we didn't try any other buffets either.

There are no good restaurants here except fast food - McDonald's, Quizno's, Starbucks, Dairy Queen/Orange Julius smaller menu closed by 8:30 when we went there one night, Baja Fresh (don't let the name fool you), although we didn't try the Steakhouse. We ate at the buffet twice - once for lunch and once for supper - hard to make any healthy choices as everything is sauced or fried or creamed (unless you ate lettuce). Apparently two new restaurants are supposed to be opening soon (even though we thought they were open already before we went from the website) - a Burger place and a BBQ place. Even a small bottle of water ended up costing close to $4 (can you say gouge?). On Freemont Street we were buying water for $1 a bottle for the same size. Our room was okay - the safe was locked and we called to get it opened as it was not useable - they said they would show up to fix it in 1/2 hour and we waited over an hour then gave up and left - of course we missed them but we didn't bother to call again. The dresser door was broken. The hairdryer was broken in the bathroom. There is no room in the shower to put your soap and shampoo bottles except a tiny shelf where nothing will fit. There was so much yelling and screaming in our hallway at night we were constantly woken up all week long. There were cigarette butts all over the hallway outside our door when we got up one day and we are in a non-smoking floor. OH YA our view was looking at another brick wall - apparently all the even numbered rooms in Tower 2 where we were, all look at this view so maybe try to get an odd numbered room if you are located in this Tower. Not sure about the other tower views and room numbers. The lady at the counter where you sign up for the \"points\" card was rude and couldn't have cared less. However on our last day we had an Asian guy with a different name (dang wish I could remember his name) and he was awesome! I'd love to write a note to the hotel management and let them know that this guy is a keeper for sure! And something we just found out on this trip too was if you call the hotel directly to book your rooms etc. it all counts as money spend on your \"points\" card and you qualify for a better rate - so if you want to earn a few comps you might want to check this option out. And check back often with the \"comps\" desk as you might get a free buffet or $20 starbucks credit to use (although even that was a hassle as the girl at the Starbucks didn't know how to process it and we held up the whole line up and people were getting a bit upset behind us even though it wasn't our issue that was causing the hold up). We were two gals in our early 40s, no kids with us, but I was surprised at the number of kids in this hotel with all the \"over 18\" things going on. (Although the hotel does promote itself as the family friendly place!?) The male dancers were trying to take pics with any gals walking by for $25 a picture and trying to lure you in with cheap plastic mardi gras beads, and this was right close to the \"dirty\" dancing stipper pole girls which were both located close to the escalator to go down to the \"fun\" dungeon where all the kids are supposed to go and play games and have fun - really? With the big Sponge Bob statue looking on? and the Bar/Restaurant called Dicks - use your imagination . . . might be a fun place if thats what you are there for (hey I agree its fun sometimes) but all mixed in with the \"family friendly\" image? and all located right close together? Is that so dad can stare at boobies and mommy can take a picture getting her butt slapped by a greased up stripper while the kids get their picture taken with sponge bob? It just seemed like there is a lot of confusion over what image the Excalibur is trying to be and it didn't fit together very well. Plus add on the \"resort\" fees of approx. $12-$15 per night for things I don't use on holidays why should I have to pay that? Put your total price online without adding the fine print and really tell people what you are charging instead of trying to make the price look good and not being upfront about it. I don't need wi-fi or a partial fitness pass (you'll pay even more if you want to use the good stuff). And if I do want it then make it an option to pay the extra resort fee. The only good thing about the resort fee was you could make free domestic calls (which included calling to Canada) but I don't phone home every day when I'm on a holiday so . . . with cell phones and plans I didn't really need to pay $15 a day x 7 days = $105 extra to make one phone call home. This was my 5th year in a row visiting Las Vegas and my first time trying the Excalibur, but it will definitely be my last time at this hotel. I've tried 3 times on the strip, and twice off the strip, and you get better value staying off the strip or downtown for sure. The only thing we really did like was the location was good - and easy to get around and use the transit system and only a short cab ride to the airport.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGood for the Price\u201d", "Author": "MalekV", "ReviewID": "UR120682845", "Content": "We picked a random weekend to visit Vegas in November not realizing there was fight that weekend and hotel rooms had skyrocketed. Excalibur wasn't one of our first 5 choices but they offered us a deal we couldn't refuse. M-Life membership has its priviledges apparently. Since our deal was so good, we opted for the renovated Tower II and it's pillow-top mattresses and flat screen tv. That's what we got - pilow-top mattresses and a flat screen tv. The floors were still old, the walls were still banged up and the shower still had a 15 year old shower head. Not really worth the extra $25/night. Customer service was good. The long lines at check-in moved quickly enough and the counter person was very personable. Our upgraded tv wasn't working when we checked in but a call to the front desk had someone there to fix it within 20 minutes. Extremely acceptable considering it was check-in time. Housekeeping left us alone for the most part but missed making up one bed on one day. It was a bit odd to come back to the room and see one bed made up and the other not. The Casino is typical of middle range hotels on the strip (although the craps tables seemed overly springy compared to others on the strip). Finding waitresses on the floor was a bit of a challenge but not impossible. None of the dealers were rude to us so that's a plus too. I was a bit disappointed that the \"Draft and a Dog\" price had gone up to six dollars and the quality seemed to go down at the same time. My main complaint is location. Excalibur is on the south end of the strip and to get to most of our starndard haunts took a bit of walking.

The Excalibur is a typical Las Vegas strip hotel; really a destination in itself with restaurants, bars, shopping, and of course all the gambling you could ever want.

The Excalibur is located at the south end of the strip, and it's a fairly long & inconvenient walk back up the strip to the hotels where the best shows and buffets.

I recommend you get a 24 hour bus pass ($7). It's good for the Deuce bus that goes up and down the strip (very slowly) and also the express bus. You can also use your bus pass to take the WAX bus to the airport, saving you a bit of money. Taxis are expensive ($10 to get anywhere), and the monorail is also expensive ($5 per ride) and the stations are not convenient to most hotels. I was a little miffed about the $12.50/night \"resort fee\" the hotel charges on top of all the regular taxes and fees, but it sounds like all the strip hotels charge it now. With your resort fee, you get free internet, a free newspaper, and something else...I can't remember.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cNot so \"families with toddlers\" friendly\u201d", "Author": "YayLinda", "ReviewID": "UR120587995", "Content": "Stayed at the Excalibur hotel for an 11-11-11 wedding. We decided that the Excalibur would be a good fit for us because of the price & it seemed family friendly. We stayed in tower 2 on the 15th floor in a Widescreen room with a view of the strip. The room was fine, had a big flat screen on the wall, 2 queen beds, a nice view, it was clean & the bathroom was big. The walls are thin & you can hear anyone walking & talking passed your room. Check in & Check out was easy. The main problem I had was the smoke smell as soon as you walk in the hotel....all the way to the hallway of the room. The room itself was a no-smoking room but the smell in the casino & halls was horrible. We've stayed at other hotels on the strip & it was never that bad. I would not bring my kids back to the Excalibur for that reason. Another reason, there was always a Go-Go dancer at a bar by the lobby. It was an open concept bar...so anyone walking by the lobby & or by the slot machines, or even trying to get to your room....you can clearly see the Go-Go dancer dancing on the bar. It wouldmt have bothered me at all if we had gone without the kids....but her butt cheeks were out for the world to see. The only thing covered up were her boobs & crotch....it was a little weird seeing that out in the open in a \"family\" hotel. There was a huge plastic Sponge Bob you could take pictures with....& 50 feet away there was a half nekid Dancer on top of the bar. Just weird! Especially if you have older kids. Like I said....its Vegas, you expect nekid chicks, but at the Excalibur....feet away from Sponge Bob? So WRONG! Anyhow....Would I stay here again? No, the smoke smell was bad, & especially not with kids.

However, I don't expect to pay good money for a room and immediately have to ask for housekeeping to come and clean the room. Upon entering the room, I could tell by the interior corridors that the place could use a good cleaning and remodeling. Yet, I stay optimistic. When we entered the room, it was obviously just a room that was extremely outdated and a little \"rough\" looking. The furniture was scratched up and extremely dusty. The AC unit had not been cleaned out in years. The carpet was dingy and extremely dusty in the edges all around the room. The first thing I do when I get in a hotel room, regardless of the condition of the room, is take off the bed comforter. I then check for bugs. It's a habit that I formed when I got into the hotel industry, which I have been for the past 13 years. I inspect the sheets on the bed to find large stains. It was terrible. I then go to the bathroom and inspect. The towels and washcloths were old, housekeeping had left a shampoo bottle and conditioner bottle on top of the shower, which is probably still there because I didn't touch it. I call the front desk and ask to speak with a manager. She then transferred me to one and I told her what I had found when I inspected the room. She then sent me to housekeeping where they were coming to clean room and change sheets. Its Vegas, we were in a hurry to get down the strip where the action happens. I would have asked to change rooms, etc. But, we were okay with them cleaning the room just so we wouldn't have to go through the extra procedures of changing rooms and etc. We came back to the room hours later and indeed the housekeeping cleaned the room, obviously in a hurry. Anyway, my point is that I would NOT ever in a million years stay back at Excalibur. To me, this hotel needs to remodel and change housekeeping procedures or hire housekeeping staff who care about the property, before it would be up to anyones standards.

I'm sure a lot of you were in Tower 1 so I can't comment on that as we were in Tower 2. My husband and I were there 3 weeks ago and absolutely loved it!! The only negative we had was on the night we arrived. My husband put an $80 voucher into the machine I was playing as I only had a buck left and we wanted to cash out & combine the 2 into 1. The voucher got jammed in the machine and after 15 minutes of my husband looking around the whole casino for floor help (also had the machine light on), found no one. Then I tried for 15 minutes including standing in the one cashier's line with 15 people ahead of me to no avail. Finally rectified after one hour at 1:30 a.m. We also stayed here for 5 days and was only bothered once or twice a day by time-share people. Just smile, say no thank you, and they will leave you alone. They will not harass you as others have said. PROS: If certain things are important to you in a room, ASK FOR THEM when you book. A high floor, quiet room, and non-smoking room was important to us and that's exactly what we got. The receptionist said she'd given us an upgraded room, without us even asking. (Staff in the whole place was always friendly) The room was large, new, spotless and the bathroom had a nice,large countertop for lots of room for your toiletries.. The bed was super comfy and the room had a good plasma TV and quiet air-conditioning, and also a safe. We also only ever saw 1 room service tray left in the hallway, and when we came back a few hours later it was gone. (Definitely none of these trays being left for days in the hallways as some have said) And, no evidence at all of lots of garbage in the slow (HUH???) elevators. As well,, hallways are not narrow and dark. The casino is very nice and it was NOT AT ALL smoky. The buffets at Excalibur and also the Luxor are both quite good; one has some things better, and the other has some things better. You're certainly not going to get crab legs here, but delicious beef and a wide variety of food items. The Tournament of Kings show is highly recommended. Each person gets soup, a whole small chicken with potato & broccoli & bun for dinner and apple struedel for dessert, as well as choice of water or soft drink. Can also buy alcohol. As you sit and eat, the knights and their horses put on quite a show in front of you. They get the crowd involved and it's really good fun. If you want to eat inexpensive at the Excalibur, there is a food court (with a McDonald's as well) on the upper floor. Also must comment on the handiness of having the moving walkway going to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay; was wonderful. Didn't have to go outside if you didn't want to. KID'S ISSUE: There wasn't one at all. Not that we don't like kids, but were afraid we'd be bombarded with them, especially in the casino, as a lot of people have said. I think we saw maybe 6 kids in total the whole 5 days we were there, but of course realize July & August & school holidays would be much different. CONS: Besides what I said abou the casino in my opening, was the lack of security by the security guard that is sitting before you get to the elevator to go to your room. Of the 5 days we were there, he didn't check our hotel room key once, as he's supposed to, so why is he there? For the price we paid, we found the Excalibur to be a fantastic place and would have no hesitation in staying there again. To all the people who hate it there, I'm sorry you must have had bad days and situations. In our opinion, just make sure you ask for what you want in a room and make sure you get Tower 2 and then please don't be frightened off by the bad reviews and people saying it's a dump and dirty, etc. For the price you pay, no it's not the Bellagio OR their prices either. but you will get a nice,modern ,clean room in Tower 2 and find it's an overall wonderful place at a great bargain.

It bordered on painful. Two buddies and I were there mainly for the Breeder's Cup horse races. Because of a big auto parts convention room rates in Vegas were sky high, hence our choice of the Excalibur. It was still unusually expensive, but beat other choices. Check in was very slow, and the \"Resort Fee\" is now $14 a day. They don't tell you what you get for it, but it includes wired internet access in the rooms, ethernet cable provided. Funny marketing message on-screen when you first hook up - \"Enjoy this complementary internet access as part of your resort fee.\" This place is old-school strip, meaning dark, confusing casino. The smoke from the first cigarette ever lit still lingers in the air. I can usually ignore second-hand smoke, but this was truly unbearable. My lungs still ache. Most properties in Vegas (even the older ones downtown) have done a good job improving ventilation and filtration in their casinos. Not so at the Excalibur. Our room was in Tower 1, the less desirable of the two based on other reviews. It lived up to its generally low ratings. While the mattresses on the beds were OK, the roll-away they provided was from times long past. It was painful. Everything about the room other than the flatscreen was very dated. Water pressure was awful. The shower flowed at about a pint a minute and the toilet took several minutes to refill. The sink faucet trickled. The door to the bathroom was missing some of its laminate from years of whatever. Heating/cooling was via an aged through-the-wall unit that rattled and roared with each cycling. No one slept well. Hall decor was a mix of heavily-patterned ancient carpet and wallpaper that didn't match. Who cares, right? But it was so funny looking I had to take a couple of pictures. Like most strip properties, it's a long way out and to anywhere else, and you have to get there through the casino. No, that's not a forest fire you're trying to get through, it's the cigarette smoke. Stay near the floor and cover your mouth with a wet rag and you may make it out alive (OK, that's an exaggeration). We gambled there a lot, mainly because compared to other strip properties they have reasonable limits and decent odds. Cocktail service was a plus. It's a low-roller joint, so $1 tip gets attention. What else is good about it? The connection to Luxor and Mandalay Bay, the budget food court, and possibly the $32 all-day buffet deal. The restaurants are expensive, but you have a wide choice of fast-food places in the second-floor food court, and their prices aren't inflated. The all-day buffet price is a bargain compared to the restaurants. We never tried it, so I can't comment on quality. You can take a free tram or indoor walk to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Luxor has redone their casino. It's modern with much better air quality, as is Mandalay Bay. I read all the time that Excalibur is a great place for families. I guess so if you want to introduce the kids to smoking at a young age. Yes, all casinos permit it, but I've stayed in at least 15 different Las Vegas hotel casinos on the strip and downtown, and this one rules when it comes to poor ventilation and a dark, dungeon atmosphere. Rates can be cheap at times, but, at least in Tower 1, it's no bargain. It was the worst room I've ever had in Las Vegas (and I've been 20 to 25 times).

The room on the second floor now looks at a brick wall right outside the window and this is a deluxe room how????. The first night the toilet kept running all night tried to call maintenece the next morning no one would answer the phone so we went to front desk and the girl told us it would be fixed. The third day came and not fixed went back to front desk and got told \"If we didn't complain about the first room and make them move us we wouldn't have this problem\". Beware you get what u pay for in this hotel which isn't much and for the rate we paid we could have stayed at a number of other propertys on the strip for equal or less money which have much better reviews.

Last time in Vegas I stayed at Circus Circus, which is on the other end on the strip. I pulled up to the front after not being able to find a close enough parking spot. I was greeted by Angel, who works the front entrance, and told I just wanted to drop my bags off and find a place to park. Being from California, Valet parking costs a lot. Angel informed me that it was free there, he then went to get a cart to load my bags onto. He then gave me my tag and told me to call in about 15 minutes to have them deliver all my bags to the room. That helped in a big way! I went and checked in, once again a very nice experience, and went off to my room. I called for my bags, and about 5 minutes later they were delivered by \"Ish\". All the staff there were very nice to deal with. The hotel is located in a very great location, right across from the MGM and New York New York, and right next door to the Luxor. The walkways take you to any of these hotels with out having to cross the street, The Tram Station is also on the walkway on the way to the MGM. The tram costs $5.00 to ride one way, but found a better way to travel the strip and all the way to Fremoint Street. There are 2 different Buses that travel up and down the strip, one is the RTC and the other one, and my favorite is the Deuce.The Deuce is a double decker bus. I took this the first night to Fremont to meet friends there. You purchase your tickets near some of the bus stops. I purchased a 24 hour one for $7.00. You just get on the bus and swipe the card. I think they also take exact cash for trips as well, not sure how much. The bus stops along the way and you acn get off to go to other hotels and then get back on to continue.if anyone has seen Pawn stars, the bus come within 1/2 a block of the store, but not down the street. thehotel ahs a lot of great places to eat at as well. On the second level is a huge food court and a 24 hour store. Near the Excalibur and many great spots to check out. The Hard rock, Coca Cola World, Harley Davidson Cafe, are with walking distance. Walgreen's has a store near by as well, and CVS is down the street a bit and on the other side. Even Ross has a clothing store near by in case you need to get a fancy outfit and a great price.

Weeks before my trip, I modified the reservation to put my friend's name and their credit card for the deposit so i get the refund, but the reservations department told me that i will get the refund upon the check in of my friend because they are using a different credit card. I checked out my room and verified the other rooms that was used by my friend, i did not get the refund until i has to ask for them to reverse the charges. So if i hadn't checked the bill of the other rooms, I will have to collect money from my friends. 2) Upon check in, I informed the Front Desk Agent that we will be paying cash and use the credit card for incidental charges, the Agent told us just pay upon check-out. Even if my friend paid in cash, my credit card was charged the whole stay. and have to collect the whole amount from my friend with which we don't have to do when she already took the hotel room payment. 3) Don't accept room upgrade since the upgrade's difference is just a sofa or a small work table.

OK, whatever. We proceeded to check in, which went smoothly. Went up to the room (Tower 1, 25th floor) and the first thing we did was check for signs of critters (aka bed bugs). I am super paranoid and that is always the first thing I do. Everything came up clean, but the bedspread had some stains and tears, but appeared clean. The whole room looks a bit dated. The bathroom only has a shower, no tub, but there is a hairdryer and an iron. After the first night's sleep, we were not too impressed with the bed. The mattress is so soft, it is like sleeping on a marshmallow. We had some trouble with the wired imternet connection, so we called the desk and they sent the engineer up right away. He was pleasant, told us the whole hotel was haivng a problem and that the service provider was sending someone to repair the issue. He checked our box and the cord and decided to replace the cord because it had a small nick in it. The next day, my aunt and her family joined us down the hall. They were trying to \"comp\" us again for a family pack, but we decided not to go to the presentation they wanted us to. My young cousins enjoyed the pool, but said it was cold. As someone from and area with smoking bans everywhere, my biggest peeve was smelling like cigarettes all the time because of the heavy smoking going on on the casino floor. We tried the buffet deal for a day, but breakfast was not that great (slimy eggs and breakfast meats and stale pastries), lunch wasn`t much better. The bracelet allows you to eat at the Luxor too, so we went there for dinner. It was MUCH better. Not sure if it was just the time of day, though. We also had breakfast at Dick`s Last Resort (theme restaurant where everyone is rude to you, located in the casino at Excalibur). Breakfast was huge, but very greasy. Tip: don`t buy generic Vegas souvenirs at the hotel- Grand Canyon Experience just down the Strip has most of the same stuff for WAY less money.

Tower 2 has recently been renovated and I would highly recommend you pay a little bit extra for the newer rooms. The room was clean, spacious, and well appointed. We got a 25th floor room facing the Luxor which all though it wasn't strip view was still quite nice. Some people don't like the theme because they feel its too cheesy but I for one really enjoy the themed hotels. I feel its more Vegas then all the new modern hotels you can find anywhere else in the world. We ate one breakfast at the hotel which was quite good. There's so many options in Vegas for food so you definitely can't go hungry. On our last day we bought a buffet resort pass which includes both the Excalibur and Luxor hotels for the day. Great value for money as long as you can handle eating 3 buffet meals in the same day. This was the first time trying this and I don't think I would do it again. By the time it was dinner we simply weren't hungry enough to eat at a buffet again, but both the dinner buffets for the Excalibur and Luxor were good. Overall I would definitely stay there again since it is great value for money and the hotel is really well located. It is a very short walk to the CityCentre monorail by the Monte-Carlo hotel which takes you directly to the Bellagio so if your a bit tired its quite nice.

The room was spacious and clean, bed comfortable and we had a flat screen TV. We booked well in advance and paid $38/night less AMA discount at checkin, plus $12.50 resort fee. We requested late checkout to 2:00 p.m. and paid an extra $25. Well worth it as otherwise we would have spent the entire time in the checkout and baggage check line. The internet connection did not work but after one call to the support line and one visit to the front desk, it was replaced. The internet was included in the resort fee. The staff were very pleasant and accomodating. Only bad thing about the hotel as well as others in Vegas is the cigarette smoke. You have to go through the casinos to get to anything and they allow smoking. You can even smell it on the non smoking floors. They need to get with the rest of the world and review their laws as only a minority was smoking. We paid for the buffet 1 day $32, but in retrospect, would have only eaten the evening meal there. Breakfast and lunch were okay, but in the evening they had fabulous prime rib, sword fish, mussels, large peel & eat shrimp all for $20. Desserts were awesome throughout the day. We bought half price tickets to The Auto Collection at Imperial Palace and the Titanic exhibit at Tix4Tonight, but they had Cirque, Phantom, Lion King and others available. I found out later the Auto Collection has free passes on their website. We had purchased Phantom tickets in advance and arrived early and were the first to be seated in the cheap seats. They upgraded us to 4th row centre!! We phoned Ambassador shuttle to request pickup but after waiting for 20 minutes past our time and seeing none of their shuttles, we hopped on board an executive shuttle. Executive, Showtime and Grays had several shuttles stopping at the hotel. Our driver said \"Friends don't let Friends ride with Grays\". Not sure why? We had a fabulous time, but there is a dark side to Vegas and should not be a family destination.

I was a lone traveller stoping off in vegas to have a look around before continuing onto Montana for my main stay to meet up with a group of Travel agents and tour operators. You may want to know that i work in the travel industry, so i feel i can give an unbiased review. Just a tip to start, i had decided that i was going to get a shuttle bus, which was fine, however in hindsight i should have got a taxi because the Exc is so close to the airport for an extra dollar or 2 it would have been worth it, especially if there is 2 of you staying. So my first tip is get a cab if your staying at this hotel. Well first off when i went to check in, there was a small queue of about 15 people, but this wasnt a problem, as there was plenty of staff working, and i waited about 10mins, which was fine. However there was a problem with my booking, 'apparently' my booking had been cancelled by the 'customer' (which was me)! Now bear in mind i am a travel agent and booked this direct with our USA supplier through my account manager, this was quite a surprise to me!! This obviously was quite anoying, but was handled ok by the check in person, who asked for a swipe of my credit card so they could get me into a room, and we would then sort it out in the morning, for my inconvenience i got upgraded to a widescreen room. Well to cut a long story short the next morning i went down at 7.45am and got this sorted after about 40minutes of phone calls to the company who i booked it through. But here is the thing, when this problem occured the duty manager told me that this was cancelled by the company i booked through. Well after i got back to the uk i checked this claim out with my account manager, and it turned out it was 100% the hotel error and i got a written appology from the hotel. So unfortunately i was lied too by the check in person and the duty manager, which is really disapointing. However after this intial annoyance, everything else was fine. Location The hotel in my opinion is in a good location, at the south end of the strip, but on the srtip, so you have great access to the busses and other hotels. You are next door to luxor, New York New York, and MGM. Some may want to be in a more central locationm, however i liked the fact that everything was bascially north and up the strip from where i was staying, which made finding and visiting things easy. I walked up to the fashion mall which to me was bascially the end of the strip you would want to visit, this took about and hour I also took the busses up to freemont st, which took from 25-50 minutes depending on the time of day. Rooms The room was perfectely fine for me, it was clean, a good size, and had a nice tv. The pillows and bed was very comfy, which incidentally was the case in all the 7 hotels i staying in during this trip! There were toiletries in the bathroom, but no tea and coffee making facilities, which would have been nice. No complaints at all with the room Hotel / casino I didnt really use any of the hotel facilities, such as the pool, but as i could see it from my room, it looked fine and was well frequented. The casino, i didnt use, but had a couple of drinks and a hot dog in seemed fine, not as shiny, new or as many bells and whistles as other strip hotels, but when your paying \u00a335 a night, you cant really complain. It wasnt smokey as others have reported. Wifi tip There wasnt wifi in the rooms, which is where vegas seems to be behind to the rest of the world. However if you went into the food outlet part of the hotel you could pick up the free wifi offered by Krispy Kreme donuts! Food on the Strip IMO you can spend hundreds of dollar or just a few dollars. Can you do vegas on a budget? absolutely! This was the start of my 12 day trip of the states, so i couldnt go mad with may cash, so was carefull what i spent it on. I ate at the Planet Hollywood buffet, and used a voucher i got from the internet, it was clean and tasty, but i wasnt overly impressed. I think i paid something like $20. Anyway the best bit was the $11 drink as much as you can add on you can buy, So for $30ish i got all the food and drink i could eat. I also ate for lunch at the main st station near freemont st, which i felt was much better, and better value for money at about $7.99 which is fantastic value for money, and the dining room is beautifull. I would choose the main st station of PH everytime if i went back, the only down side is its at freemont st. Vegas on a budget There are loads of casinos that offer happy hour discounts or permenant discounts for drinks. THE BESt value i found was at Casino Royal where they were offering Bottles of Michelo for $1 and forzen margaritas. The bar tender was also very freindly and i got talking to some customers who were also freindly. Also went to happy hour at the bar just inside the entrance to PH, sorry i cant remember the name, but it was buy on get one free. Look for vouchers, i got a $10 voucher from the internet for the Planet holywood buffet. Hooters were doing a discount on bud i think for $1.50 per bottle. Take a walk up the strip and look for adverts in the bar and casino windows for happy hours etc, so you can get an idea of where you want to go perhaps in the eve.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cGood Enough\u201d", "Author": "formertravelagent", "ReviewID": "UR119834489", "Content": "We got a great deal and I would stay here again if the price were right.

Let me tell you it is not as bad as some say. Yes the hotel is a bit dated, but it appears to be clean and although it can be smoky so are a lot of properties on the strip. We had a room in tower 2 on the 3rd floor. View was not terrific. We were rarely in our room so did not actually matter. The bed was comfortable and clean (no bedbugs). We had a deluxe room with 2 queens and a little sitting area and the furniture appeared newer. The previous guest had left the in-room safe locked. Unfortunately it took them 2 hours to get up to the room to unlock and because we had to be in the room for them to do, it was a bit of a hassle. The bathroom was large, however for those people who enjoy a bath they may be disappointed as there is only a shower. The pool area was good. There were plenty of loungers available around the four pool areas, the only complaint is that the loungers were not very comfortable. The pool area had sun for most of the day which was thoroughly enjoyed. The food court was very convenient and really an added bonus. It was not too far away from the rooms and some of the restaurants were open for late night snacking or early morning coffees. A Starbucks at 7am is a must for me:). If you are looking for glamour and glitz, this is not the hotel for you.

It is moderately priced and very convenient at the south end of The Strip, across the street from the MGM Grand and from New York New York but only about half the price of those two hotels. The rooms are large, if plain, and generally very clean. I find three things to be aware of (or beware of): 1. Prices vary wildly from day to day, depending upon what conventions are in town. This is definitely a case of \"charge whatever the market will bear.\" If your plans are flexible, check the hotel's web site closely for prices. A weekend room might be $120 while the same room a day or two later might be $39.95 (plus taxes plus the mysterious \"resort fee\"). 2. Avoid the Excalibur buffet. Las Vegas has many excellent buffets but this isn't one of them. 3. There is no wi-fi but each room has WIRED Internet connections in each room. On my last visit, the Internet connection in my room didn't work more than 50% of the time. Looking at the modem in the room, the ONLINE light didn't come on at all when it was malfunctioning. Repeated calls to maintenance didn't seem to make any difference. Apparently, the in-house folks had no idea how to fix it. Luckily, I also had my 4G Sprint wireless card with me and it worked perfectly during my entire 5-night stay on an upper floor. I suspect Sprint's signal was strong that high up.

When we first arrived at the hotel, we were stopped by an employee of the hotel asking if we were just getting to the hotel and needed to register. After telling her that we DID need to register she walked us over to a small counter, introduced us to another woman and said that SHE would take care of us. I was very shocked to find out that we could NOT register at this desk, but was blindsided with a sales person trying to sell us a TIMESHARE with offers of reduced prices for any show we wanted to see, and also $150.00 in free comps. The only thing we would have to do is go to a free breakfast, and go to a \"2 hr seminar\". As my wife was telling this sales VULTURE that we had to think about it, and that she really had to use the restroom, the VULTURE walked around the dest to show us where the nearest facility was, she literally walked toward the enterance with us and I swear she would have gone into the restroom with my wife to continue her sales pitch. Talk about being pissed off as soon as you walk in the door. We finally got away from her,and finally got registered, we started enjoying our stay at the Excalibur. The rest of the staff were very helpfull. The room was very clean, but the chairs at the table were uncomfortable. We were in a great location: first floor in tower 1. Another problem that we had with staff was: every time we either walked out of the casino or came back into the casino, more vultures would keep asking if we wanted to see a cheap vegas show. They were relentless and would not give up. Even after we checked out, and were walking to the door to get in a taxi for the airport, they were on us like vultures. As far as the casino, we had absolutly NO problems. We didn't like the fact that there are so many penny slots and the min. bet at the tables were as much as they are.

When we checked in, we were upgraded to one of the newly remodeled widescreen rooms in tower 2, with a 42\" plasma screen tv, new furnishings, and a beautiful view of the mountains. The hotel, of course, is medieval themed, and stays true throughout the whole resort. We stayed on the 17th floor, and it was always quiet, never had a problem going to sleep. I've seen alot of complaints on here about the timeshare people, well, they are everywhere in Vegas. Just ignore them and go on about your way. Our only complaints were that the Roundtable Buffet was not very tasty, and the resort fees that you have to pay when you check out.

We flew direct with Virgin from Manchester. When we landed we headed out to the taxi rank and grabbed a cab straight away, but forgot the first thing i had read prior to the visit, DONT let the cab go by the tunnel route, he needs to go left not right! The difference was $23 to Excalibur and $11 on way back not going via tunnel ! This time we stayed at the Excalibur at the South end of the Strip, previously at the Sahara at the North end which is now closed.This location was a lot better as there is nothing between circus circus and the stratosphere at the north end, and it's a bit shady down there! The Excalibur is joined with internal walkways or monorails with the Luxor and Mandalay Bay and just across the road via walkways to the New York, MGM, Tropicana. Check in was speedy and receptionist pleasant, although we didn't get the adjoining rooms we requested, this was rectified when we noticed neighbors leaving and asked if we could swap rooms, which was sorted no problem. We did notice that there was a large que at check in at various times,especially the weekend when it did get busy! We tried our luck for a Free upgrade,without success. Our room was on the 19th floor in tower 1. Tower 2 is nearer the pool and spa. The rooms were very large with 2 queen beds, flat screen tv, writing table and chairs, the bathroom was large and had walk in shower. There was a safe in the room, iron,hairdryer and free toiletries.The maid service was spot on, and although I hung the towels up for re-use they still got changed everyday ( maybe because I left tip from day 1). Although the decor is a bit tired and could do with an upgrade the rooms are large and ideal for a Vegas trip!! e.g your not there to sleep!!! Oh yeh the beds are comfy. Air con works, although mine smelt of pea so I didn't use it. The bad point of these rooms were they faced the airport and road, so there was a bit of noise, the other side of the corridor had no view. Gambling- if you want to gamble on the cheap and want your money to last a bit, do it during the day and during the week. The roulette min. was $5 then it went up to $10 at night or at the weekends! We went down to Bills gambling hall further down the strip for cheaper gambling,$3 min during the day. Freemont street is not as cheap as we thought $5-10 min although well worth a visit. Eating- we tried the buffet twice and was not impressed, not much choice and it looked like it had been there a while. Better taking walk to the Luxor or splashing out for the MGM dinner buffet, salmon,oysters,steak etc for $30 all you can eat The steakhouse Rib Eye was great!!! Drinking- we thought the drink prices dear ( but we're from a small town) $6 for a draught beer in Dicks last stand, a noisy in yer face bar/eating place, if like wearing paper hats with slogans/ jokes on while you eat, this is for you! This is where we met the bar man with attitude, and apart from 2 dealers were the only staff with negative attitude,he refused to serve us without ID,even though we had been there for 2 hrs and was there for another 2 when served by another. The octane bar is ok but quiet $7 a bottle of bud. Nine Irish man bar in New York is good crack, but again dear. We got a taxi $10 up to Mac Mullens Irish bar on East Tropicana street, this was a great authentic Irish bar with great food, cheaper drink and live intertainment. Transport- the best way to get up and down the strip is the downtown express bus,( the smaller long bus) it doesn't stop at all the stops and you have to buy a ticket at the machine at the stops, you are better carrying a credit card as most of the time they wouldn't take cash $7 for 24 hr unlimited. They have spot checks for tickets, although we only seen this once in a week and that was from Fremont street later on at night, you either wouldnt get on or put of at next stop if you were unlucky, certainly didn't seem the locals bought tickets. This is the bus to get on for the premium shopping malls at either end. The deuce bus you can pay as get on, and stops at he stops and therefore is usually busy.There is a stop outside the hotel for South bound and one across road at Tropicana for North, although you have to go down to MGM for the express! Shopping- oh boy, there's shops every where, a premium outlet at either end, with good discounts the North is slightly better though the bus goes through some rough areas and you get some dodgy bus mates!!! Planet Hollywood mile shopping arcade, caesars, fashion mall all on the strip. Town square shopping mall between Mandalay Bay and Premium outlet south, get on the downtown express outside Excalibur, this has Apple,Holister,AF etc in a lovely layout, Millers Ale house is across road, good food $7 pitchers of beer and lots of sports screens. Pool- the pool area is huge, with lots of beds and free towels. We didn't try the spa or gym!!! Surprise surprise! General- although this hotel is billed as child friendly hotel (although who in their right mind would take a child to Vegas) we didn't see many! The smoking in the casinos and bars take a bit of getting used to again! The constant clicking of the mexicans with call girl cards and the black fellas trying to give you music cd grates on you while walking the strip! We didn't go to any shows, so I cannt comment, we did however do all 3 of the stratosphere rides on top of the tower....awesome! And the Fremont street light show is great. In summary this hotel is great, you get what you pay for! If you want fancy pay more and stay elsewhere!

We had friends in the other Tower in the standard rooms and the difference was very noticeable. The casino was friendly and there was a good variety of shops although if you didn't want the buffet breakfast your choice was limited to sticky donuts and pretzels etc so every morning we walked to the Luxor and went to MacDonalds there. Although if you go onto the strip breakfast is much cheaper, it depends how much time you have. No Wifi, which was disappointing unless you went to the Krispy Kreme shop where there was a hot spot. If you gamble at the tables the hostesses will bring you drink and you just need to tip them maybe a dollar each time and then you don't pay for the drink which is great if you are on the table a while. Roulette is what we played most of the time. The pools are nice there are 4 only 3 were open when we were there. One of the pools has a slide which is great fun especially if you have kids with you. We had a car and parking was free and easy to find there is also a free Valet Service there. There is a daily resort fee plus tax but I expected that.

As with any Strip hotel the lobby and the elevator bank to the room is always a hike through the casino and then there it is. Here, it was a long walk and then when I got to my floor, my long walk continued way down a long hallway, LOL! Not bad for me, but if you are using a walker or other mobility device, ask to be put close to the elevator. The room was very clean and the cleaning staff did a good job of attending the room daily. My friend was on another floor and found though that even with the \"Privacy\" sign hanging on the door, the cleaning staff still entered. On that note as well, the only concern was that there was not dead bolt or secondary lock on the door. My room was large, big king bed, table and I faced West with no view of the strip. There was wired high speed internet and what I loved was that calls to anywhere in the US or Canada were free! That was a plus. In the mornings to get to the food court meant a long walk again through the casino, up an escalator and then to the food court. Though very minor, it would have been nice to have some more food choice options a bit closer to the elevator bank in Tower 2. There was a small coffee kiosk there but that only offered muffins, no bagel or other breakfast items. Being a non-smoker, I found that even though I was on a non-smoking floor, smoke still managed to seep into my room. The windows opened a little so that solved this problem. Note, Vegas has no non-smoking laws so keep this in mind if you plan to travel to any Strip hotel. All the casinos are filled with second-hand smoke---no getting around it. As I mentioned, asking for a non-smoking floor and opening the window should help with this. Front desk staff were nice on check-in, on check-out I found the person a little distant but at 5am, she was probably just tired. Would I stay here again-- most definitely. It was at the South end of the Strip and with some good running shoes, I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go.

All the hotels are part of the same group and you can access them without any problems. The Excalibur has got one of the cheesier themes of the Strip hotels and it certainly lacks some of the quality of the others but you get what you pay for and it represents great value for money. The room we had was large with two queen sized beds and a large bathroom/shower room. The decor is a bit on the tired side but it is clean with the towels and bed linen changed daily if you request it. There is a large pool area with plenty of loungers. Even during the Labour day holiday weekend when the hotel was very busy, there was no problems in getting a good place at the pool. There is a spa/gym which we didnt use, but it offers all the usual facilities and treatments. We were in Tower 1 which has a bit of trek to the pool so if possible try and get a room in Tower 2. One annoying aspect of the hotel is the number of times you get stopped by staff looking to sell you show tickets or meals. This is common to all hotel in Las Vegas, not just the Excalibur but it gets to be a real nuisance. A good tip is to split up when walking through the Casino as they tend to only target couples. There's a variety of bars and eating places in the hotel which again represent decent value for money in Las Vegas. The pound doesn't go as far as it used to in the US at the moment and any time you can get good value you should go for it.

The pro's of this hotel is that the rooms are clean and modern. Good views overlooking the mountains or the strip. I found the beds comfortable. The hotel is typical of the hotels on the strip.There is smoking in most common areas, lots of restaurants. This one has A Baja express, McDonalds, pizza hut, Starbucks, Quiznos subs and many other fast food chains. They also have other restaurants. An all you can eat, all day buffet. when we were there I think the all day buffet pass was 32 dollars, this allowed you to eat Breakfast, lunch and dinner at the buffet for a total of 32 bucks a person. Pretty reasonable price. We ate there for breakfast and it was well stocked and a pretty tasty start to the day. They also have a Dicks restaurant. Seems to attract a regular flow of patrons. I have never eaten there but looks interesting to say the least. I saw a sign that a Lynyrd Skynyrd bar grill will be opening in October. Just up the street off the strip is a In Out Burger, awesome burgers and great prices. It is walking distance but a good walk. The nice thing about the Excalibur is there is tons of self parking so if you are driving there is easy in and out for parking. The pool area is nice. They have 4 pools, one adult, one slide pool and two regular pools. I think three of the 4 pools are open all year but not totally sure. They have bar service at the pool.The pools are nice as you can get shade if you choose and also full sun. Not all pools in Vegas are like that. A negative for me is those people always stopping you and asking\"How long are you here for?\" They seem to be at so many hotels in vegas its annoying. I try not to be rude as i know they are only doing their job but at the same time my hotel should be a safe zone from salespeople and its my vacation. I stopped once and it was your typical sale. Not sure if they are all the same but once bitten, twice shy. So now i just say \"nope leaving tonight\" The hotel is pretty south on the strip if you compare it to the Mirage but i still find it a good spot. It is next door to the NY NY and across the street from the MGM Grand. I think this hotel has everything you need for a good Vegas vacation. There is a kids arcade area downstairs in the casino, I have never been but I am sure it is a great stop for the kids. Being next door to the nyny you can also take the kids on the roller coaster there. The MGM has the Lion feedings at their hotel and they also have a rainforest Cafe for the kids. This is an Excalibur review and not a vegas review so I will stop there. Feel free to message me if you have any questions on the hotel or vegas in general. I will do my best to help you have a great trip. This hotel in my opinion is a fantastic value. One last note. Hotels in Vegas charge a daily resort fee. At the excalibur I paid 13 bucks per day. This covers the wireless internet, pools and parking. Considering the rooms can be as low as 47 bucks a night it's still a bargain.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palos Heights, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value For The $$\u201d", "Author": "ToddRA", "ReviewID": "UR118080777", "Content": "I had the opportunity to stay at Excalibur over Labor Day weekend for 6 days/5 nights. I chose this location when I found an online deal at their website for a discounted stay. My flight arrived earlier than expected on Thursday, and the front desk check-in staff was more than cordial in letting me check in earlier than 3 PM. My room was one of the upgraded rooms with a king bed and 42\" TV. My room view faced the Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and the airport, along with the mountains. The room was clean and everything was in order when I went in. There was absolutely no smoke smell, so I am not sure what previous reviewers were talking about, unless they stayed on a smoking floor for some reason. Inside the room, there was a network cable available to connect your laptop to for internet access. My only complaint with that was that it was a little slow on internet speed. But, who goes to Vegas to hang out online? :) What was nice too was that there was free phone service in the room, allowing you to call anywhere in the US. Not a bad deal if your cellphone minutes were limited for any reason. As for the resort as a whole, it was really more than I expected. The casino was nice and didn't smell of smoke, thanks to an excellent air circulation system. I even won a few times on their slot machines while I was there! I did dine at the Camelot Steakhouse one night and truly enjoyed my experience. The food was phenomenal and service was top-notch. The Buffet at Excalibur was average at best. The food was cold, tasteless and really wasn't worth the $15-20 pricetag, depending on which meal you were there for. I tried both their breakfast and lunch buffet on two separate occasions. I would recommend eating someplace else. I also did the \"Tournament of Kings\" dinner/show in the basement of Excalibur. The show was great and food was exceptional. This is much like the Medieval Times dinner/show that is around the country. It was very enjoyable and definitely family oriented. The outside pools of Excalibur were well-maintained and the chairs were plentiful. The only complaint I had was the innattentiveness of their waitresses. I wanted to make a drink purchase, but no one ever stopped by to check on me. That's something that pool/bar management needs to address. When it's 107 degrees outside, people do get thirsty. Ask for the order. It's as simple as that. As for the location of Excalibur, it is not in the heart of the strip, but you are close enough to walk it or cab it if necessary. Plus, Excalibur is connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay either via walkways or through a tram. All-in-all, I really enjoyed my stay at Excalibur and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice place to stay that won't break the bank.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "RedDeer", "Title": "\u201cits ok\u201d", "Author": "ThePolisher", "ReviewID": "UR118041411", "Content": "The only thing i didn't like was there's no where to eat after 9 pm , except Mc donalds . and they forgot to book my wife's spa day.

We also requested a king room and were given one with two queens, which wasn't a huge deal but worth mentioning. I would probably only stay there again if there is a room with a more comfortable bed.

Also all you smokers out there that leave your cigarette butts all around the pool, shame on you. It's really sad when you sit along the pool and you butt out wherever leaving a big stinky mess.

It is a Medieval Castle themed property that It is nestled in Between the Luxor and New York - New York on the Southern part of Las Vegas Blvd. We stayed in a standard room with a King Size bed and the room was nicely appointed and very clean. The hotel offers internet via a LAN cable that you can plug into a laptop as opposed to WiFi. It is worth mentioning for smartphone or tablet users that might need WiFi since these type of devices usually don't have a LAN port. The hotel has a pretty nice size casino. If you intend to casino bounce, get a players card as soon as you check in ( known as the ' mLife card ') as it can be used to earn comps not only at Excalibur, but all of the MGM properties in Vegas ( NYNY, Luxor, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, etc...). They have 3 pools on the property which were a pleasure to use on the 100 degree days that we encountered. There is cabana service available, in addition to a poolside bar/cafe which had great frozen cocktails. Buffet court is pretty good with decent selections and offers an all day dining option for around $32 for 24 hour access. We only dined there for breakfast and my only complaint was that the coffee was a bit week. There is a Starbucks and a Camelot Coffee for those needing a strong cup in the morning. The Steakhouse at Camelot located near the buffet court was top notch both for service, decor, and food. Other food establishment you can find at Excalibur are Baja Fresh, McDonalds, and Dick's Last Resort. There is an RTC transit bus stop right in front of the property if you intend to use the 'Deuce Bus' to shuttle up and down the strip (It was $7 for a 24 hour pass and has bus stops near every casino on the Strip - highly recommended if you don't have a car).

I'm trying to balance out the good service I've had over the years (in fact, some of it at the beginning of this week) with the terrible experience I just had. I'm a business man, and I get the multiple pricing model(s) that hotels use. But it's my opinion that if a customer comes to you with the lowest price in hand (on a smart phone) you should honor that at the desk. Leaving that argument behind, I was forced to go online to get the best rate (after spending nearly a grand on hotel rooms), so I did. I then got to the desk before check out, to roll over my reservations. And when I expressed my frustration with the resort policy, I was talked to down to by both the desk attendant and her supervisor. I made it clear I was frustrated the resort and not them personally, but they continued to be rude. They could care less who I was, what I've spent, what I know, or how long I've been coming their (this was the 4th time this year). Which is strange considering that I have never been comped or pampered in anyway. Looking at the money I've spent and my years of loyalty to this property, I can't help but feel as though I may have been wasting my time. In fairness, maybe I just got unlucky enough to find to the two worst humans employed by this property, and they wanted to take a shot at me. I know several others who work there that are great.

Traveling were 2 adults (25,26) and 1 child (4). We stayed for 2 nights in late August (Sun, Mon) and paid $30/night + $14/night resort fee (which is ridiculous, but I did know about it prior to going, so I was expecting it). Check in was quick and easy - there was a big line, but, plenty of people working and it moved fast. We were an hour early for check in, but it didn't seem to be a problem. We got 2 complimentary buffet passes per day as a special when we booked to almost any MGM property, and those were given to us at check in without any problems. The time share sales people in the lobby that everyone complains about...they said hello to us, and would start saying something else, but we just kept walking and said \"no thank you\". It was annoying, but, never really a big deal. They were always friendly. Our room was a standard room in Tower 1 - I was concerned about that, but since we were only in the room to sleep, I didn't care much. The room though, was clean, cool and comfortable. It had the upgraded plasma, which was nice. We were on floor 11, with a view of the roof, but, again, I only booked the cheapest rooms, so I didn't expect much. The elevators were dirty - that is probably my biggest complaint. We described the decor inside as \"midevil meets Dennys\". They could have done a much better job with it, but then, I'm sure I wouldn't have paid $30/night. We ate at the Excalibur buffet (for free) Monday morning. No complaints. It was nothing special, but, there was a decent variety, and we all filled up- everything we tried tasted like Dennys. No Lucky Charms - that was my 4 year olds biggest complaint, although I'd prefer for him to try something new. :) We ate at the Monte Carlo buffet (for free) for lunch Monday afternoon. Decor was nicer, but food again was nothing special. Plenty of variety though and we were happy. We loved the 4D rides at the Excalibur - we did them all using a coupon in the book they give you at check in. If you have young kids, those are a must! We tinkered around in the game room for awhile and won a couple of cheapie stuffed animals, but, those make a 4 year old happy, and when he's happy, Mom and Dad are happy! It was nice having the food court upstairs - we ate breakfast at Starbucks Tues morning, McDonalds Mon evening for dinner. Also loved the walk ways through to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. It was really hot when we were there, so that was a nice indoor option to kill some time. The tram was great also. We hung out at the pool for a bit on Tuesday morning. We were there early, so lots of seating, pool wasn't too crowded. My child had a blast since there were plenty of areas where he could touch the bottom - which made it easier for Mom and Dad to relax a bit. Kiddo had a blast on the slide - another complaint would be the life guard at the top of the slide. She was the most disinterested person person I have ever seen. She wasn't really watching anything that was going on. It's a pretty tame slide though, into shallow water, so I guess there's not a lot of watch. Overall - we had fun. If we come back, I'd probably stay at another hotel, just to experience somewhere else, but if I was on a big budget, I'd have no problem going back to Excalibur if we were traveling as a family again - and even staying in the \"cheapo\" rooms again.

The room did not meet my expectations: ugly carpet (which actually started as soon as you enter Excalibur), a view of the roof, outdated bathroom.

The other restaurants seemed to be very \"fast food\"-ish...so did not try any of them.

The only let down was the incredibly noisy A/C which kicked in when ever the temperature fell/rose over the one which I had set. This disturbed my sleep quite a bit. The Casino/hotel itself provided a good base, and its location at the crossroads with New York, New York / MGM Grand & Tropicana is very handy. The monorail (to Luxor, Mandalay Bay) and the elevated walkways over the boulevard make it easy to walk around the vicinity. The niggle I had with the casino floor (compared to others) was the smell, as there was an everpresent aroma of Coconut & cigarettes - not pleasant. Other casinos smell much better! One of the main reasons that we selected Excalibur was for the friendly, relatively low stakes poker room where less confident players do not feel intimidated. We were not disappointed, and I would definitely recommend a 'refresher' poker lesson from one of the many experienced dealers who will explain the nuances of 2-6 limit that they play here. The pool area is large and you can always find a sun lounger even over a busy weekend period.

Rates are cheap for such a good strip location, but it's not a luxury property--rooms are simple/no frills, but comfortable. Buffet is ok--nothing special but not bad and pretty cheap. Downsides: time-share stringers are all over and really annoying. I wish the hotel would boot them or at least limit their activities. Also, the mandatory MGM \"resort fee\" is irritating--it's basically a way to boost revenue while keeping posted rates lower, by charging an additional fee that's in addition to the advertised rate.

These are my opinions and I know Vegas is not going to change because of them, that still does not make it right. On the other hand, after paying $40 more for a modern TV and a view, I must say it was the best view I have had at my dozen stays at Excalibur. I like the location, I like the short walk to other world class hotels and casinos and I like the pool area, well, my kid likes the pool.

We were a bit worried, since we read the reviews, but decided to choose this hotel. Great choice! Registration line was long, but fast. The clerk was cold & not informative. I had to ask lots of questions about amenities. We told her we were celebrating our 20th anniversary & was indifferent until I told her it was our 1st time in 20 years traveling by ourselves. She smiled & she said she knew how it felt. From then on, she gave us a free update to the 2nd tower (close to pool, gym, spa & food court!). Got to our room on 13th floor & was very happy. Room was very clean, lots of towels & big plasma tv. Our cleaning lady (Emma) was very friendly. Kept our room clean & every morning she will greet us with a smile & a good morning! For breakfast we went to the food court. We had mc donald's big breakfast with hot cakes (cheap, healthy & fresh). We spent around $5 & change including the drink. It's open 24 hours ;) drinks & food are very expensive in las Vegas, therefore, we visited pizza hut, quiznos & mc donalds for food. We also did the buffet for an entire day. It was delicious & inexpensive compare to other buffets. Loved the dessert variety! Felt in heaven. Tip: to save on water or soda, there's a souvenir shop on your way to the m&m store that sells liter bottle water (2x$2)...Very close place and you can find little gifts for less. We recommend the water fountain show at the bellagio (it's free, romantic & it gave me chills-specially when they played the titanic song). La salsa cantina was an excellent Mexican restaurant. We had great savory food (lots of it) for less than 30 bucks for two including drinks. Service was fast & our waiter was very nice. We told her we were very hungry & she made great suggestions! Rain forest cafe wasn't that good. Service was extremely slow (not that many people), spent over 50+ not including drinks & tips & we were still hungry. Had to visit mc donalds afterwards. Most restaurants close at 11pm & prices are too high. Tip: while you gamble, u get Complimentary drinks (we gave tips). We highly recommend the pi\u00f1a coladas! Better than paying big bucks on the strip for watery ones ;) ok, enough with the food. Excalibur is connected by a \"bridge\" to new York hotel. To get to luxor or Mandalay bay, you need to take the Monorail which is free. Tropicana is very close too. The pool is very big. There are 4 pools, really good modern music playing & a big sports bar. The gym is small but have many treadmills, a water cooler, lockers & clean towels. Was never crowded. Clerks at the spa were very informative & gave us great suggestions on what to do or where to eat. We had a great time & will go back again since we didn't have enough time to finish visiting the entire strip. The casino at this hotel was always crowded & alive!! Lots of music, dancing, people having a good time & when it was time to sleep, we did peacefully.

There were alot of reports saying the casino smelt of smoke, not once did we feel it smelt of stale smoke! The pool area is fantastic, DJ at the weekends, the only problem we found was there is little shade and being very fair skinned really needed some, the only way for gaurenteed shade would to be to hire a cabana or pool side bed but at $40 alone was over the top. I feel there really should be parasols for people as i would just fry, however this is the same in all hotels in vegas. we were llucky there was an area if you could get it was slighty shaded! The bedrooms were large and spacious! very average and probably a little tired looking but nothing to complain about considering how long we were actually in them! The buffet is fantastic price especially if you purchase the all day buffet, which we did if we were staying at the pool or hotel most the day! defo a must! other then that do as much as you can while you are in vegas, we saw 5 cirque shows, 2 magic shows went on a champagne tour, helicopter ride, went up the eiffle tower the list goes on ... it was fantastic!

To be fair to the hotel I would have mentioned it to them at check out, but we were strongly encouraged to do the express check out as the queue was so long and so I didn't get my chance. I would just suggest that if it happens on your first night it will happen again and so do mention it to the reception staff to sort out.

We paid $95 a night Wednesday and Thursday. Friday night we paid about $20 more. For that price we got the room with the flatscreen tv in Tower II. If you have young kids, this is the perfect place to spend time at the pool. There are 3 pools for kids, one pool just for the adults and 2 jacuzzis. One of the pool includes a slide. The basement is where the arcade room is for the kids. We went in there with a pre-established budget and the kids had fun earning those little tickets or trying to win a stuffed animal. The basement would benefit from a thorough cleaning because it really smells. My son and I watched the 3D shows. It's expensive for what amounts for 30 minutes of fun, but we had alot of laughs. We were careful not to go out on the strip too much in the evening, because there are alot of shady characters giving out shady coupons on the street. It's really not a place for kids. There is a movie theatre nearby, though, which is convenient. During the day, when it was too hot to be outside (110 F), we were happy to take long air-conditioned walks inside each hotel and window shop. The Excalibur is well situated on the strip for that. Each complex has a great toy store, so we made sure to manage expectations on that one otherwise we would be broke in a day! Our room was simple but very comfortable. We never heard any noise. Note that the drapes don't completely cover the windows, so kids are up fairly early, no matter what time they go to bed. The bathroom was very nice, but not much water pressure. We were disappointed to learn that the rooms did not carry wifi. The buffet upstairs is fairly pricey, however, the food is good , and was our only option if we wanted to get away from the dreaded fast food fare, without dining at expensive restaurants.

Overall the experience was enjoyable- especially considering the price was well below most other hotels on the Strip. Let's start with my Likes first: Likes--- Price. I don't know how you could beat the price. The first thing most people would be concerned about is whether the price is due to poorer service or quality. I never felt that, to be honest. The buffet wasn't as good as MGM or Aria but a) you can use your buffet tickets at other hotels (like MGM, Aria, or Luxor) and b) it wasn't bad at all. It had a lot of fresh choices. Staff. The staff were amazing. You could have transplanted them into any other hotel on the Strip and they wouldn't have been out of place. My father had to use a scooter during our stay due to a recent stroke and the staff was very accommodating. In fact, we had to change out scooters several times (a few times due to our mistakes) and they never asked questions and were extremely kind about every ordeal. Their patience was limitless at the Bell Desk. The gentleman that helped us to our room was not only kind, but he gave me some great advice on where to go during an outing thatI had planned to the Valley of Fire. Great advice. The Dungeon. It was the children's area in the lower level, which my niece liked. But honestly, we all had a pretty good time down there. It wasn't overpriced and the games were enjoyable. I wish the attendants were more readily availabe, but that's just a minor criticism. Tournament of Kings. I have another review of this event, but let me say that we enjoyed it. This is a definitely \"like.\" And now my dislikes... Dislikes--- The smell. Before that sounds too critical, let me be fair to say that the smell that I disliked was the deoderizor they used to rid the casino of the smoke smell. To me, it was overpowering. This may not be fair because my family didn't complain. However, I visited several different casinos and never felt that they were overpowering. Being pestered. As soon as you walk into the hotel with bags, you will get pestered by the staff about shows, etc. It's pretty easy to shake them off, but a bit annoying. After they get used to you, you won't get it much, but every once in a while we were bugged after coming back into the hotel after a long day/night on the Strip. This could/should probably be toned down a bit. Overall, I would recommend the Excalibur. The casino is nicely laid out. The buffet is good and the food court has a good selection. Kids have the pool area or the Dungeon where they can go to kill time while the parents either play along or gamble- or rest.

Well if this is their re-modeled room I would hate to see the normal room at this hotel. The room was dirty and smelled. The bathroom was old and did not even have a tub. They do not put comforters on the beds. It is a plain white sheet, blanket, plain white sheet. They even left the blanket off one of our beds so we were cold all night. Not classy at all! The only positive thing I can say about the room was that we had a great view of the strip. The pool was very crowded and there was no shade anywhere. They were all out of pool towels and we had to wait over an hour to get clean ones while my kids stood around and shivered! The kids enjoyed the kids fairway with the games and prizes. I stood in yet another huge line to try to buy tickets to the Tournament of Kings for dinner and it was sold out for our night. They should have signs up posting it is sold out so clients do not have to waste their time in these long lines for nothing. I cannot say anything very positive about this place. Its dirty, crowded and not worth it. You can stay elsewhere on the strip and get a much better value for your money!

There was some strange oily smell all through the passage and we could not discover much about this though stayed here for two days. The rooms are disappointingly small. The AC is noisy, if you need the room to be too cool, much required in this hot place. The television has no good free channels. The bath room is a basic facility with no bath tub except for a small shower. No toiletries are provided. The message was clear and loud from the hotel- that you are here not to sleep and spend much of your time inside the room, but you are here to spend them with your money every where else!!! My nephew with me, who had stayed earlier in the tower 2, felt it was a better choice than this. The hotel needs to refurbish the tower 1 immediately. Till then it is better to look for a place in the tower 2 if you plan to stay here. The only pleasant thing is the check out facility through the television, in tune with Las Vegas.

This was our first stay here and had heard decent reviews from friends. I knew it would be very kid friendly and more laid back. What no one told us was the Grandview employees who stalk you as you literally check into the hotel. They promise you a show tix, dining and gaming vouchers for a hour long presentation. Seems easy and we already have a timeshare so we thought it wouldn't hurt to get a good free show to KA and dining vouchers. We went early morning and they took us to the Grandview Hotel about 15 min off the strip. It was very pretty and secluded. They set you up with a sales rep and they do their \"pitch\" and show you the rooms. Easy and simple at this point. We are all friendly and start saying looks nice but not the right time for us...no need for two timeshares. The sales rep does the numbers....gets a manager who does his sales pitch but is more aggressive and throwing in insults to our desicion making. We finally get them to let us go after being very nice but firm in saying No we have one already. But you get sent to another sales rep who tries to scam you into a even cheaper deal of a lifetime excuse before they let you out of the room. But theres more.,.....you get to sit in another room and wait for your name to be called so you can get your vouchers and show tix. We get called into a cubicle and guess what?? No show tix for us because its SOLD OUT for that night! WOW....you can say I was pissed and annoyed that they can't even hold their end of the bargain. We lose 4 hours of our vacation so they can say \"Sorry its Sold Out\". Real piece of work these people are and its a lesson learned on our parts. Free is not worth it!! Just buy the show tckets and avoid the rude scammers...The GrandView employees at Excalbur and Luxor!!! Say No! This trip would have been over the top if we had never met these people and wasted our time and lost out on a good show.

We passed by the reservation's counter a number of times over the weekend and always saw long lines of people waiting. However, this was not the case during the weekday. We were upgraded to a widescreen room at no charge, which was nice since we didn't request it. The room was more than adequate and had a fairly large bathroom. We didn't have any problem with hot water, as others have mentioned but the water pressure was on the weaker side. One other thing to mention was the noise from the air conditioner, which was quite loud in our room. We were a little disappointed with the house keeping service, as one of the trash cans was still half full when we checked in and although we checked in early, it was on someone's omission, as the room had already been cleaned. Also, we were there three nights and only had the correct number of towels the day of arrival. We were on the 15th floor in Tower 1. If you like to use the pool a lot or the fitness center, ask to be in Tower 2, so you don't have to walk from one end of the resort and through the casino, every time you want to go there. The only thing that we wish the Hotel would curb, is the time share property sale representatives that hunt you down every time you walk past, which is at check-in and at very exit on the property. They act as if they're there to offer assistance and then hook you into the sales pitch, which gets quite aggravating when you've passed them ten times a day.

We stayed in room 22207 which was an upgraded Widescreen room with a view of the strip at no extra charge. The room was nice, the decor and furnishings were modern, and the room was clean.

We had a good time playing in the casino, but we ventured to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, NYNY, and MGM mostly. The layout is simple and easy to navigate, but it gets crowded, especially on the second floor, in the evenings.

We saw the Tournament of Kings show, it was alot of fun for couples, families, or anyone who loves to eat and watch a good show and participate with the actors of the show. We also saw the Chris Angel Believe show, which was good for the whole family, but I would warn some about the loud music they play during the show, it may be too loud for little ones, and also they have some creepy looking props that might scare little ones a bit. The Excalibur has decent rooms, we had the King bedroom, smoking, and the celing was a little dirty, but the rest of the room was clean and the bed was soft.

We were going to stay there for 4 nights, and we upgraded to a better room in tower 2 for a bit more money. I suggest if you stay at Excalibur, you stay in tower 2, considering it is more recently renovated. Watch when you book online because they only charge you for the first night rather than the duration of your stay, so be prepared to pay for the hotel even if you think you have gotten that covered! They charge you a \"resort fee\" now as well, and what should've been a much cheaper trip grew into one much more expensive. I think this fee is a joke, considering the amenities at this hotel do not \"wow\" me. The hotel also smells of strong solvent, probably put into the rugs and upholstery to stop it from smelling like smoke near the casino.

We weren't really sure what to expect since the reviews here were either really good or really bad. We had been to Las Vegas before, however this was our first time to stay at Excalibur and the first time for us to bring our 8 year old daughter. Our vow renewal for our 10th wedding anniversary was the purpose of our trip and we wanted to include our daughter in that. (To those of you that frown on kids coming to Vegas, shame on you! There were more than enough attractions for her to see and we knew what was what when we were there and sheltered her from what she needed to be sheltered from. It was an amazing trip!). When we checked in we were corraled by the Timeshare folks, but because they had a great offer, we signed up for the 2 hour timeshare tour. We got 4 tickets to the Shark Reef Aquarium and $200 in gaming and dining vouchers. After a short sign up there we were able to check in at 11 a.m., no extra charge. Not only that, but we explained why we were in Vegas and got a complimentary upgrade! We were still in Tower 1 (which is nowhere NEAR as bad as people make it out to be on this site), 25th floor with a Strip view, which filled our window at night! The room was themed with the whole knights-of-the-roundtable theme, which I thought was great! We had 2 queen beds and I will tell you, I'm picky when it comes to a mattress. It wasn't as comfy as ours as home, but it was the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on in a hotel. The room was more than accomadating for the 3 of us. It was very clean, and it was a non-smoking room and there wasn't even a hint of cigarette smell. We were given a room with a widescreen TV which we used only at bedtime. The internet IS wired, however the cordis long enough to stretch all over the room, and it's pretty fast as well. The room was clean and comfortable, which are the main things I look for in a hotel. We never had to wait more than a minute for the elevator. They were fast getting us from the lobby to the 25th floor and back down. The staff was extremely friendly, from the registration desk, all the way to housekeeping. Even the Timeshare people were ok. Just tell them, \"No thank you\" and they'll leave you alone. As far as kids in the casino: as long as you are just passing through you're ok. If you stop and are too close to machines or tables, someone will very politely just explain that your child is too close and will direct you where to go. The casino does smell of cigarettes, but we also went into MGM, Tropicana, Hooters and New York New York and they all smelled the same way. There is a food court upstairs and I'm pretty sure we got a little bit from everywhere; again, great staff! We had the buffet twice for breakfast and once for dinner and it was wonderful. Just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, I would find something else!! There are also little souvenir shops upstairs. Helpful hint: all the same stuff is downtown for WAY less! There is an arcade downstairs for the kids and we spent HOURS down there playing the games with our daughter and spent no more than $20. She LOVED it! Check your coupon book; 2 free midway games! The pool is another great spot. 3 different pools, 2 for families and 1 that was adults only. Helpful hint: get there early! There are a few places that you can more your chair and get some shade. Otherwise you have to rent a cabana or an umbrella chair, or bake in the sun. One of the pools has a small water slide that my daughter (and husband) couldn't get enough of. Be sure you have your room key with you when you head out there. You won't be allowed access if you don't have one. The casino after dark, as well as anywhere else on the Strip, is no place for kids. There are half nude knights and \"wenches\" dragging you over to take a picture and there are girls dancing on the bars. We knew this going in and made sure that we were back in our room, or avoiding these areas, after dark. Speaking of the casinos--- tightest slots I have ever seen, but my husband won big on one of the 3 card poker tables! All in all, this was an amazing trip. We chose the Excalibur because it seemed to be kid friendly and it was extremely affordable. In fact, we got our room 40% off, $203 for 4 nights, that is including tax and the resort fee(If you stay here, you have to pay it whether you use the ammenities or not, which really is the only bad thing I have to say about the Excalibur), and the complimentary upgrade.

We always enjoyed out visits but this time upon checking in (we arrived on 7/14 and left 7/19) it was very disappointing to see how the place changed in just one year. First off we had to pay $70 to cover out use of the spa, the pool and internet. We explained to the lady checking us in that we never used any of these things, and that we never had to pay for it. But we were told we had to do it. Secondly the food served in the buffet was almost always cold. But more than anything we realize that the Excalibur like other hotels is trying to reach out for family bookings. I think that you should look into how you can eliminate these children from being on the casino floos where they are running, screaming and not being supervised by their parents. More than that was the fact that you have all of these college kids running all over the place and unfortunately (I really can't blame you guys for all of this) but they never without drinks in their hands, loud and wild.. I was really disturbed by the fact when coming out of the elevator 4 young ladies were laying on the floor drunk and their friends were trying to get them up to go to their rooms. I was also very surprised tosee dogs in the hotel. It was not very comforting when you are trying to sleep and one of the guests dog barked half the night. It might be a good idea for the planning staff or whomsoever is in charge of the management should try to work out something whereby they children are not running all over the place (with a chance of injury) and the drinking of the college kids leads me to think about other places where college kids go to have fun and a girl ends up stating that she was raped or that she winds up dead. I hope that these things will be something that your hotel can work on to try to enhance the Excalibur and not bring it down.

The main eatery within the hotel is a buffet with a reasonably wide range of food. Most of the dishes we sampled were bland. There is also a steakhouse next door to the buffet where the food and ambience is far better, with prices to match.

In fact it was the only hotel on our tour that we would definitely NOT book a repeat visit. The Excelsior is definitely the worst hotel we have experienced anywhere for years.

Never thanked me or made me feel welcome. When we were done with check in we were told to go to tower 2 which was on the other side of the front desk and required us to through the casino. My 8 year old son got an eye full to say the least with dancers dancing on stage. Looked like we were downtown near an airport strip club.

(Now that we got through the bad and the ugly, lets talk about the good) The best part of our stay was the pool staff and water slide pool. We got a cabana near the kids pool and came with a lot of amenities. It had a couch with a table, 2 chairs with another table, I think it was a 48\" TV and 4 lounging chairs. It had a refrigerator, and a cabinet to keep our personal things as well. If you go when it's hot I would highly recommend this. Tracy our server was extremely nice as well to start and then went to another server who was OK but wish Tracy would have been there all day. Anyways we stayed all day at the water slides. The only bad thing was they closed the kids pools at 5 PM which I thought was early as it was still hot outside. If we do go back to the Excalibur it may be for 2 days and it will be only for the pool, but all in all was a good trip. P.S. We did not play in the casino that much as all there was is $10 tables.

In the past we had good experiences but this last trip was not so good. We had two comped nights at another hotel but got a deal on the excalibur that offered me $75 in resort credits and $50 in free slot play so because of that I decided to get to vegas a day early to take advantage of the resort credits so we could use them for food or show tickets . Well, maybe i should have read some fine print somewhere but because i do not have a credit card i could not get the resort credits. I found this funny since i stay at treasure island all the time and they allow me to make a cash deposit to get the resort credits . I explained to the women checking me in that i booked this room because of those credits and it was our only food money ( kind of a fib). She was extremely rude and i was told to go to the rewards counter to ask them. I knew right off the bat this was just an attempt to shove me off on someone else and sure enough the guy at the rewards counters words were \" I have no control over resort credits here you have to talk to the front desk about that \". I just finally gave up. It would have been nice for them to make some kind of compromise and give me some kind of free food coupon free upgraded room or something but i was not offerred a thing. Now to get to the room. In the past i had always upgraded to a wide screen tower room . this time I didnt. Honestly, the room was about the same quality as the widescreen tower room. The furniture is a little older but it still had a flat screen t.v that was the same size as the widescreen room. The beds were actually pretty comfortable and everything seemed to be clean. We had a non smoking floor but was hit in the face with the smell of marijuana the second we stepped off the elevator which i cant blame on the hotel for that. I guess if you are only paying for $21 a night you have to expect to be around $21 a night kind of people. We enjoy the food court there . There is a little bit of everything , pizza hut express , mcdonolds, quizno's , crispy cream, starbucks. Basically a lot of cheap food which you cant really find in some of the more expensive hotels. I have mixed feelings on the pool there. There are three pools , one which is an adult pool but of course ive never been able to go in since i have my daughter. There are two water slides in one of the pools but one of them is always out of commision. TOO MANY LITTLE KIDS IN THE HOT TUB!!!! I dont like the idea of being in a hot tub with diapers. There are a lot of chairs but if you dont get down there by 11 am you will not be able to find a seat. I like the location of the excalibur and how it is connected to the luxor and mandalay bay by an indoor walkway and just a bridge away from new york new york and mgm grand. If it was not for the rude service i had and the broken promise of resort credits i would probably give this hotel a little bit of a higher rating. Another thing I want to add about the room and the option to upgrade to the widescreen tower room. All the widescreen tower rooms are in tower two which is were the pool is and for some reason it seems to be a little less crouded. In tower one you can expect to wait for an elevator for 15 minutes ( not exagerating it actually happenned to us) .", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cVery good value and great location\u201d", "Author": "traveltherockies", "ReviewID": "UR114664051", "Content": "This hotel is a very good value FOR WHAT YOU PAY.

At times, the distance to another hotel was a definite factor in deciding where to go. We always needed to make sure we budgeted enough energy to come home because the hotel is so far south! The rooms were adequate, the bathroom floor and shower floor could have used a re-do, but it wasn't disgusting. We found the beds uncomfortable and didn't sleep well at all during our 4 night stay, but that may have been a personal preference issue. We enjoyed the pool area, the DJ and the drinks gave it a fun party feeling. The hotel has 4 pool areas, which meant they could handle a lot of people without feeling overwhelming. However, we did not spend a lot of time at the hotel, so I can't speak to the restaurants or other-onsite activities. We did find the concierge to be very helpful when we were looking for a place for dinner, and he recommended several reasonably priced yet very good restaurants that we wouldn't have looked at (bonus points for him not recommending a restaurant in the hotel).

It was so worth it for us. I've been going to Vegas all my life and this is the first time I have ever stayed here. My husband and I had a great time! We drove all night and arrived about 6:15 AM. I didn't know if we could check in or not. Valet Parking guy got a bell hop (Marlon) to help us with the luggage and he took us straight to the registration desk. Gentleman at check in was going to put us in a regular room in Tower 1, but Marlon cajoled the man into putting us in a Widescreen Room Deluxe in Tower 2. We were offered this upgrade in our email and since it was available, we took it! Glad we did. Room was on the 4th floor facing East Tropicana Avenue and New York New York, VERY quiet and spacious room. The bathroom was huge! Flatscreen TV, table and chairs, sitting chair with ottoman, huge chest of drawers, safe, and yes, a noisy air conditioner, but it was like white noise for us, so it didn't bother us at all. Beds were okay. Clean and comfortable. Room came with a blow dryer, iron and ironing board. There is no coffee maker or mini fridge, which didn't bother me none. We brought an ice chest anyway and that worked out perfectly. As for coffee, yes, the hotel wants you to buy yours, there was a convenient coffee shop as you exited Tower 2, also there is a Starbucks upstairs in the casino. I don't understand those who say the hotel casino is hard to navigate, follow the signs, walk along the carpet path and voila! It's not that big of a casino floor. It's like the MGM Grand, follow the signs. We got around with no problem whatsoever. Loved the pool area! A pool for everyone to enjoy. I also enjoyed the Dungeon, the game room area. Big kid in me still loves a challenge to win a toy. These are some areas I wish were addressed - Resort Fee - Really? Why? Never used anything to be charge $14.00 a day for. Bathroom - Nice and big...BUT...the granite counter top is too high. I'm short and this was a bit of an annoyance. Also, who thought of putting the toilet paper roll holder behind and to the left of the toilet? Peephole in door - Up way too high to be of any use for me. I couldn't see out of it. Security wise, that's an issue. Casino/Hotel - I wish there were more restaurants to choose from. The ones available were not impressive. I enjoyed the Food Court food more. EXCEPTION - Baja Fresh, they were on the ball and had great quality food for a reasonable price. Buffet was okay, but nothing great to charge $19.99 for dinner for. Also, can the drinks at the bars be any more expensive? $8.00 for a shot of Smirnoff and cranberry juice? Beer was $6.00. TIP - Bring your own booze OR, buy the drinks in the gift shops, a couple of bucks cheaper. Add on those annoying people who try to get you to a free show at the cost of sacrificing 90 minutes of your life at a timeshare or resort buy in, seminar. Just walk past them, after a while they will leave you alone. My husband and I rode the monorail up and down the strip one day. Even though you have the very upscale hotels of the Venetian, Caesar's Palace, The Palazzo, The Mirage, TI and etc....I wouldn't stay in that area of the strip for nothing! Way TOO many people and too crowded. Not enjoyable at all. I'll stay at the South end of the Las Vegas strip, thank you. As for the smoke issues - EVERY major hotel on the strip allows smoking, so what are you going to do? If you don't want that, stay off strip at Trumps, or any of the Marriott's properties. They have no casinos, therefore, no smoke. Overall, we had a great time and vacation.

It was conveniently located on the Las Vegas strip near the Luxor, New York New York, and the Tropicana. When you arrive, you can choose between valet parking and self parking. I chose self parking and had quite a bit of a walk to get to the registration desk. When I arrived at the desk, the check-in process was rather quick. Unfortunately, my room was in Tower 2 which was on the opposite side of the hotel from the registration desk. The hotel had standard Las Vegas amenities: slots, table games, shops, restaurants, pool, etc. They were roughly the same as most hotel and casinos on the strip. The medievel theme of the hotel was noticeable, but not overdone. When you go to the elevators to your tower, there is a station for a security guard to check patrons to make sure they are guests of the hotel. Best I could tell, the guards were only present fifty percent of the times I went past that station and they never once checked to see if I was a hotel guest. Why bother having them at all? The room was mediocre at best. If you're going to stay on the strip, you should at least get a better room for the few hours that you will be in it. It was not much better than a motel room you'd find off the highway. As money as the hotel rakes in on gambling, they should spend something to upgrade the rooms. With so many choices of places to stay in Las Vegas, the only thing that I can say which would make me recommend this one is the price. It's less expensive than several other hotels in the area.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cAnnoying timeshare offers\u201d", "Author": "BagmanNZ", "ReviewID": "UR111374461", "Content": "This was an ok hotel.

I came on here a few times to read reviews but really didn't know what to expect and kept an open mind and was generally looking forward to the trip over all to excalibur. And like everything there were good and bad to staying here. I will start with the good. 1. The price was great. We booked direct with the hotel/casino online and at the time it was one of the better deals on the strip. 2. The hotel did Not reek of cigarette smoke like some of the other reviews have said. ( but it does smell! not quite sure how to describe it, but if it's an airfreshener, it needs to be changed out and has to go! 3. Our hotel room was spacious and clean. No bed bugs, and yes I checked. 4. We valet parked and the attendants were Great! very helpful and prompt. 5. The bellhops were prompt and delivered our bags within 10 minutes upon calling from our room. and now The BAD.. 1. I am telling you, when you read about those pesky Time shares people hounding you to death every single time you walk by BELIEVE it!! you could not get by those people without them bugging you. and it does NOT matter how many times in a single day you walk by the same exact person, they will try and corner you wanting you to do their \"tour\". It doesn't matter if you say \"no\" or \" already signed up\" they will still ask the next time you walk by! my hubby and I were trying to dodge them, trying not to make eye contact, if we saw them on the left, we would veer right, and they still got us. it was ridiculous how relentless they were! and this is a big reason I may not stay here again. it was just above and beyond annoying. 2. we could not get a drink at all while on the casino floor! out of 3 days and perhaps over 12 hours gambling at just Excalibur alone, we only saw a cocktail waitress twice!! but she was walking by so fast, and she never once asked us if we wanted anything!!when we went over to NYNY within the first 10 minutes we were offered something to drink. 3. the slot machines are getting old and it shows! one machine in particular got stuck the moment my hubby put his $20 in it, and it took over an hour to get a slot attendant to come over and fix it, and that was with me leaving and treking across the casino floor in search of an attendant , finally found one, and she came over to fix the machine. ( now mind you, before this, we had all the service lights going in hopes someone would come over but after waitting for twenty minutes, i began to hunt down an attendant. 4. The staff in general are not very welcoming and you can tell they hate their jobs.( other than the bellhops and valet guys, they were great.) 5. The casino/hotel just seems old and dated. almost like a nursing home for casinos. and not very excitting. we really did prefer NYNY much better than the excalibur . and next time that is where we will stay. All in all, not bad for the money, BUT if you are looking for a nice fun place to stay as well as gamble with slots or table games, I would stay somewhere else.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeland, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing :(\u201d", "Author": "jsmcolegio", "ReviewID": "UR110973928", "Content": "This hotel needs updated carpet ASAP.

Check in was ok, although the woman on the desk wasn't what I would call welcoming.. Very disappointed with the room, I thought it would be on a par of the last room we had but smaller and no strip view. This room had tatty bedding, stains on the carpet, and old furniture. However it was a large room, with a LCD TV, and a good view of Luxor and the airport so couldn't really complain with the price we paid. The bed I found out later was very soft, the springs had gone and it had a dip in the middle. I woke with a bad back but strangley slept ok. I was disappointed how downhill this hotel had become. The casino had the worst smell of smoke than any other hotel on the strip. I am sure replacing the tatty carpets would rectifiy this. The pool area although has been renovated since my last visit, was probably the worst experience of the whole stay. I didn't book an 18-30s holiday but this is what I felt I was on. Although I don't mind loud music in the right place, I think it inappropriate to have it blaring out all day from every conseavable part that you just can't avoid it and relax and read. Gone are the families, replaced by teenages drinking in the pool. The loungers were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced with a large gap where you loose parts of your body and towels. I thought these were faulty but in fact they were made like this, though I think they were meant for cushions. Incidently, you can have for a price. I hated everything about the way this hotel tries to extract every dollar from you from any means possible. Like no coolers or cans by the pool? Now I understand no glass but coolers? Yes because they can charge large amounts for their drinks. No fridge in the room, this is a first for me in the US. Again so you buy their drinks. Not me, I filled the bin with ice. Very disappointed with this hotel and wont be staying here again. Most American's were speechless when I mentioned where I was saying, says it all really.

The furniture and furnishings were utilitarian and unbeautiful (not a real word, I know, but it gets its meaning across). We paid extra for a wide screen television. The bed was neither especially comfortable or uncomfortable (actually comparable to that at the Palazo). We found no bedbugs (we check everywhere: we bring a flashlight with us).

He took us from the airport through the tunnel, onto the highway, and around the back of the Excalibur: the fare was $25, $10 more than we paid from the Palazo back to the airport, which is considerably farther away. Tell the driver you do not want the tunnel (this is not in any way the fault of the hotel, of course, but it's the best tip I can give).

We used the airport shuttle to get to our hotel and it dropped us off at the very rear of the hotel, leaving us without a clue where to go. There were no bell desk at this entrance and no signage on how to get to reception - also no lugguage trolleys! We had to struggle our way through the endless rows of gambling machines and various twists and turns with all our lugguage before we finally found the reception desk. Not much fun after 26 hours in transit! Just as we were making the final few steps to the reception desk, we were intercepted by a lady in a black suit, asking us if we were checking in. She then guided us to another desk a few hundred meters away, with us behind her, carrying all our lugguage. This was NOT the reception staff, but promotional staff who tries to sell you all kinds of stuff such as shows etc. Look, I understand you have a job to do, but hey, let us check in first or at least, get a trolley for our lugguage. Needless to say, as soon as I realised what she was doing, I cut her short and made my way to the \"real\" reception desk, where we had to queue up to book in. Still, no one offered us a lugguage trolley, so hubby decided to leave me standing with the lugguage while he hunts one down for us - in the process, he finally discovered the bell desk and our lugguage was taken care of. I must say, the bell staff is very friendly! From here on, our stay was smooth and pleasant. The room had a view over the side street next to NYNY and a glimpse of the strip, which was nice. The room was spacious and clean, but have not been dusted in a while - maybe it has not been used for some time. The bathroom had granite tops and a huge shower with plenty, huge, fluffy towels. The decor in the hotel is very authentic and even the outside looks like a real medieval castle! It is well located on the strip with easy transport options to the rest of the strip. We had the buffet on the day of our arrival and it was not much to get excited about. Everything was various colours of orange and yellow with loads of cheese and very fatty - not many options for fresh stuff such as veggies, salads or fruit. We booked tickets to the Tournament of the Kings. Although this was somewhat entertaining, it is not a \"must see\" in my opinion. They fit a few hundred people into rows around the arena and everyone is served the exact same very basic meal. We ordered drinks as we sat down (once we managed to get a waiter's attention) - the drinks never came the entire evening, even after we asked the waiter who brought our food, to please check on our drinks. Thank goodness for the glass of coke everyone got with their food! The free internet is not wifi, but dial up through a cable in your room which you have to connect to a laptop. Not much use for an iPhone... Seeing as we could not use the internet, we basically paid the $13 per day resort fee for nothing, as none of the other free stuff is something you would want (such as a free newspaper...). I feel they should scrap the resort fee and just charge for the rooms, like some other hotels on the strip have started to do. All in all, I would stay at this hotel again, but would prefer the NYNY, where we stayed two nights on our return from a road trip through Arizona.

We were also meeting two other groups of my friends out there. We settled on Excalibur because another of my friends had a comped room there and was able to get us a discounted deal, which was nice since room prices skyrocket around this time due to spring break and March Madness. Excalibur was also conveniently located since we would be attending a wedding at the Luxor and going to the Bon Jovi concert at MGM Grand. Check in was busy but the line moved quickly and the check in process went smoothly. If you don't already know, be forewarned that there is a $14 per night resort fee tacked on to the quoted room rate. The resort fee gives you fitness center acess and internet usage. I was aware of the resort fee, so it didn't bother me but I have heard complaints from others. We were in a Tower I room and had requested a safe in the room. Apparently they have safes in the rooms only below the 16th floor in Tower I, so we ended up on the 7th floor with a view of a brick wall. Not a big deal since the safe was more important to us than the view. The room itself was clean and comfortable, but was showing signs of wear and tear - dents and dings in the walls, the shower probably needed to be regrouted, etc. The tv was a flat screen, which was nice, and the bathroom and room were both spacious which was also nice. My friends with the comped room ended up staying in Tower II and I visited their room, which was very nice - everything new, very clean looking, and in good condition. The tv was a large flatscreen, the furniture was dark wood and the bedding was crisp and light colored. The bathroom had granite countertops and they also had a safe in their room. If I were to do it again, I would probably pay the extra $20 per night to stay in the widescreen room as it seemed to be a fairly significant upgrade for only $20 more. Unfortunately it was too cold to use the pools while we were there, but the pool area did look nice. The internet is through a cable rather than being wireless, but it worked perfectly fine - I plugged it into my netbook and used it to order some show tickets. We ate at Sherwood Forest Cafe and Dick's Last Resort - the food was fine but not spectacular at both places. The 24/7 shop on the 2nd floor was great for getting snacks and drinks when necessary. Pros: location - at the south end of the strip near Tropicana, Mandalay Bay, the Luxor, MGM Grand, and NYNY since we were attending a wedding at Luxor and a concert at MGM Grand, it was the perfect location. It's also close to the airport, so getting to and from was very easy. cab line - always short and quick moving compared with the cab lines at many of the other large casinos value - consistently one of the least expensive hotels on the strip and if you upgrade to the widescreen room, you get a nice, renovated room without breaking the bank Cons: the timeshare sales people - they are annoying, but just ignore them and keep walking.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "monette04032009", "ReviewID": "UR103936547", "Content": "On I got married on NYE and took the whole family to Las Vegas and we had a fabulous time.

We were checked in really quickly and the lady that helped us was very friendly and made us most welcome. We had a refubished room in Tower 2. The lifts were easily found at the back of the casino on the way to the pool. Our room had a great view toward the mountains and looked over the pool. The room was modern with two big double beds, 42 inch flatscreen tv, 2 plush chairs and some nice lamps etc. The bathroom was black marble and really big, couldn't fault it at all. In terms of the service we recieved all the staff were really good and very friendly. We ate only at the snack places there, including twice at the Mexican place Baja Fresh. The portions were massive and really tasty. Cheap too. There's easy access via travelator to The Luxor and outisde and across the sky bridge to NY/NY, MGM and Tropicana (loved the Tropicana, definitely worth a visit). Good tip is to use the Deuce, the 24 hour bus that goes up and down the strip $7 for 24 hours is good value and we never waited more than 5 minutes for one, usually there would be one along straight away. It beats walking in the baking heat especially if you have somewhere to go and have walked the strip before. In terms of gambling, the casinos are all pretty much the same although they have a different ambience and clientele. A fun new addition for me this time was the organic roulette which is a real wheel but you lay your bets on a computer screen. Also the similar set up but with a person spinning the wheel. Almost all of the casinos are really laid back, with no dress code and patient staff if you're not too sure what to do. We visited the Mob Experience at The Tropicana which is really good fun. I wont say too much as don't want to spoil it for anyone, but there's lots of real characters to meet and jobs to be done! Worth a visit. Something else worth making the effort for is Hash House A Go Go at Imperial Palace. It's a special hash brown reastuarant but serves a lot more. Food is delivered in comedy proportions, served in a ginat frying pan.

As a wedding gift we were given 5 night stay at the Excaliber. Its probably the coolest looking hotel from the outside in my opinion, but the inside is in serious need of updating. Its very smokey and pretty crowded most of the time. We had a decent room in the second tower on the 22nd floor with a great view of NYNY and the MGM. The room had a king size bed that was decent but no real blankets just sheets and those crappy hotel blankets. I'm always cold so I didn't like that, but our heater & AC worked great so I used those a lot during our stay. Upon first entering our room I noticed a serious smell. Its hard to describe but I'm pretty sure its either the smell of smoke or the dingy smell of the hotel. Its was seriously noticeable but we didn't want to mess with trying to get another room. Our room was non smoking but there really isn't much to stop someone from smoking in any of the rooms though. Housekeeping did a great job everyday too. The pool was okay and one half was closed off which was disappointing but it looked like it needed a major cleaning so that could be why. We had a flat screen tv in our room, but no frig which I hated because I have dietary restrictions and could have really used one. Most hotels that cost this much have those but in vegas you have to rent them for $15 a day and we just decided to get a disposable cooler instead which worked fine and we used ice from our floor to keep everything cold. Saved a ton of money that way. I'm not a big gambler but the tables were okay, the slots seemed rigged but that's probably everywhere. We had one issue with our internet not working and we contacted the front desk who said they would send someone up to check it out in 20-40 mins. Five hours later no one showed and we had to go down there about it again the next day. They had a lock on our internet from the pervious guest and hadn't taken it off. Once they removed it our internet still didn't work. They sent someone up again and it took probably a good 40mins to an hour for him to arrive. Once he was here it was a pretty fast fix and our internet was good to go. I was pretty disappointed in how long it took to solve that problem and we paid for it for 5 days only used 4. With a $15 \"resort fee\" that adds up. The food court has ok options like McDonalds, Quiznos and a chinese food place. Do not eat at Dicks Last Resort!!! Its a fun place but insanely over priced. Not worth it in my opinion. We paid $60 for two drinks some fried shrimp and a cheese burger - not worth the money and not that great. Eatting off the strip saves everyone money or I would suggest the all day buffett pass for $25 with unlimited trips. We didn't use this but again I have dietary restrictions and a buffett would just go to waste on me. All in all our stay was okay and the Excaliber was just ok.

We had three rooms on the 10th floor tower 1 in Excalibur. Some others were staying in other hotels. We managed to get halfway good prices, even with the daily rate hike games that everybody likes to play in vegas. The rooms were certainly basic. They were clean, but when is the last time that you had a hotel room without a tub, only a shower? We have a 3 year old who was not with us on the trip, but I'm wondering how kids take baths there. Just a shower stall. Same with the other rooms also. The people trying to sell you stuff in the lobby were much more than in other hotels. It was pretty much nonstop trying to sell you show tickets and all other types of crap. That was the case in the lobbies and also in the exaclibur walkways outside the casino. The little gift shops in the hotel are nothing great either, as far as knowing they have you where they want you for prices. $18 for suntan lotion? Really? Thanks guys. But since we weren't there much except to sleep, it was okay. But on our last night there (St. Patty's day), we decided to do the tournament of kings thing for dinner, figuring that we could just have dinner and beers there and continue the night. Well, they came around exactly ONE TIME to take drink orders from the bar. ONE TIME in 2 hours! On St. Patrick's day. And then it took about 20 minutes to come back. The food was incredibly plain. I understand it's supposed to be like medieval times or whatever, but they had cornish hen (read unflavored DRY whole chicken), two potatos, one huge branch of broccoli and a biscuit from KFC I think. And a McDonald's apple pie for desert. But it came on a plate at least. That was for the bargain price of $59 each. The show was okay, but for it taking two hours and no beer for the whole time, you were certainly ready for it to be over. AVOID THAT SHOW! That pretty much ruined the night for our group.

Try and get a seat up top of the bus and get to the front... it's the best view of the strip! It's also a great way to check out the amazing Casinos.

Since we were traveling with a 14 and 10 year-old, we spent a lot of time researching hotels that were more kid-friendly (it *is* Las Vegas after all). While the hotel looked fun on the outside, that feeling quickly dissipated when we got inside. The casino floor area looked completely worn out, dark, dingy, and, well, gross. The restaurants were mostly fast-food chains and the few that weren't, didn't look appealing at all. We ended up eating elsewhere for all of our meals. The room, despite being on a non-smoking floor, smelled. The bathroom was seriously dated. The shower was a throwback to the 1970's. It seems like they've been trying to keep up with the times on the soft furnishings, but overall, it fell short. On the plus-side, the linens were clean and the staff was friendly. It was also surprisingly quiet. We had a great view and found the hotel to be easily accessible to The Strip. There is a tram that runs from this hotel over to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay ones.

I like the location and the walkways to the other hotels. Never had a problem and was aware this was not one of the fancier or newer hotels. Was having a special weekend for my husband 's 50th birthday. Wanted to spend our money on fun and not on a hotel room we would be in for only a short time so when I checked the prices on-line I choose Excalibur based on price being slightly lower than Luxor. Big mistake, Luxur would have been a much better choice. Here are the good items, price was great, location as I mentioned, valet parking quick and friendly and check in was a breeze. We even had 4 other rooms reserved and they made sure we were all in the same Tower and close to each other. Unfortunately there ends the good. We headed off to our Tower to find our room.. Surprised there was such a crowd to get on the elevator but not a big issue. Once on the 10 floor noticed the decor was a bit worn, The table near the elevator chipped, there was a bit of a smell and just didn't seem very clean. We went to our room and there was definitly a musty, moldy smell. The paper on the table had a childs doodle and the bedding just looked really old. Again didn't mind too much so dropped off our stuff and headed off to have some fun. But then just had issue after issue; - TV in one room did not work, never fixed all weekend. -A/C did not work in another room in our group. -Smashed glass in Hallway in front of one of our rooms. -Security guards (not just once) who were supposed to check who was coming in to floors who did not even look up or were chatting with friends. -CONSTANT assault from time share people EVERYwhere. and finally figuring out musty smell in our room was leaking toilet that was flooding bathroom and was not noticed by housekeeping. They did come and fix leak and gave me 50% of one night for the inconvenience. Now when you plan a weekend for a group and the hotel just seems this shabby and for $20.00 more we could have stayed next door you start to feel crabby. Of course we still had a great weekend but really wish we would have paid the extra $20.00.

I stay at Excalibur often, at least 4 times a year for 5 days each visit (for location purposes). Occasionally I stay at Aria or MGM as well. I am retired 3 times, financially secure, and able to travel anywhere at anytime. I was a guest of your hotel (Excalibur) for 5 nights arriving on Super Bowl Sunday February 6th, 2011 at about 4 PM at the hotel from Myrtle Beach flying Delta. I was using an Expedia booking package for the flight and hotel as they gave me a $100 discount on the trip for a total of $305. I normally book the hotel through the Excalibur E-mails and website E-mail specials. I checked out on Friday morning 2/11/2011 at 4 AM to catch a 6 AM flight to the East Coast and my home of Myrtle Beach, SC. On arriving at Expedia on 2/6, I checked in, asked for a comp to the Tower 2 flat screen room from Tower 1, was denied, and was given the option to upgrade for 5 nights for $50 to Tower 2 as is the usual if not comped so I agreed to the upgrade. The receptionist was pleasant and I had no problems with the check in process then. I am 69 years old and have a lower spine stenosis problem so my mobility then was very limited as I was to have a spine operation on February 14th, 2011. I stay at the Excalibur primarily because of location as I am limited in how far I can walk due to my back condition. Excalibur is the best location for me through past experiences. I am also a service connected 70 percent disabled Vietnam Veteran with many service related injuries and disabilities for your information. I also am neither a drinker, gambler, or smoker. I was assigned to room 12-2-62 for my stay which had an overstuffed chair and footstool which was nice for my back and of course a view of the air conditioning roof as usual. All went well until about 2:00 AM on February 8th Tuesday. I had gone to bed at 10:30 PM. At about 2 AM I was awakened by a loud disturbance in the hall outside my door, I assumed it was drunken guests returning to their rooms. A few minutes later there was a fire alarm and the PA system went on stating they were investigating an incident and to remain calm and wait for information. These alarms and PA announcements went on for 15 minutes, then an announcement was made that it was a false alarm and to continue normal activities or words to that effect? So I went back to sleep at about 2:45. Shortly thereafter there was a knock on the door. It was security and the fire department I believe (about 6 men)? They told me I had to pack up everything and evacuate my room and go to the check in desk for reassignment to another room and floor? I asked why, they said rudely, don't you see all this dry powder on the floor and walls? I said yes, but it is only PKP or fire extinguisher dry powder and it is not toxic, so just get your maintenance crew up here now and clean it up without relocating anyone at 3 AM in the morning as obviously there was no fire and some idiot had discharged a dry powder extinguisher making a mess and causing the alarm condition. They again told me to pack my things and vacate the room! I previously was a Navy Captain with Command at sea and ashore and knew much about firefighting and I knew personally the correct way to clean up a dry powder spill. One uses a mask not to ingest the powder, gloves, and a vacuum and a broom to clean up the residue as it is not toxic, then water and vinegar to clean the remaining residue. I asked them again to just clean it up now as I was fine as as my AC was drawing from the outside! They said no, we are evacuating this floor wing, and to get out now! At about 3:30 AM or so now, I had packed everything in my room into 3 suitcases hurriedly from a deep sleep. I could barely walk due my back condition which needed 10 hours sleep a night to recover, I had only had 3 hours at that point and I was in a lot of pain. When I went in the hall it was empty, I saw no other rooms being evacuated, and the dry powder was still on the floor and walls. I proceeded to the Check In desk as directed with all my belongings and spoke to a woman named Cari or something like that behind the desk. It was about 3:45 now. I told her what had happened and what occurred and why I was directed by Security to report there. She seemed uninterested in my plight and circumstances and perhaps thought that I was lying to her and just walked in off the street. She asked to see my ID card, I showed it to her. She then said nothing? No regrets or compassion for the circumstances I was in due to no fault of my own. She should be fired for her poor attitude and poor customer service!! Finally, she issued me another room on the 16th floor, it was now 4 AM. I asked her for the same type room as I had with a similar chair due to my bad back, she said the room was the exact same room. I left towing all my bags back up to the Tower 2 16th floor still in very much pain. No offer of a bellman to help me was given or suggested by the lady at any time! I got to the room I was reassigned on floor 16 and upon inspection there was no chair as I had requested at the desk and I was told it would be the same room. I called Cari? at the Check In Desk, I told her it was not a room with a chair, she told me that at time it was the best she could do! I told her that due to no fault of my own I had been up all night and I was going to hold out for a room with a chair as I had requested in a courteous manner previously under stressful conditions. She sent a bellman to the room with another Key to a room on floor 16. I asked the bellman to assist me and he said he just brought the key! I went to the next room assigned on floor 16 and it also was the same devoid of any chair, the bellman had departed. I called the Front Desk again and identified myself and told Cari? that the second room was also without a chair and was unsuitable again. It was now 4:45 AM. She said she found a room on Tower 2 Floor 3 Room 1 that had a chair, again the bellman brought up another key and left, not offering to help with the luggage. I went down the elevator to floor 3, found the room, it had a couch, so that was good enough for me at 5:00 AM. However it was 60 degrees due to being on full AC blast, on the ground floor and on the end of Tower 2. I turned the heat on full blast and crawled into bed, tired, angry, in pain, and disgusted with the Excalibur Hotel and its staff that included, security, Check in (Cari?), and the Bellmen. On Friday morning, February 11th at 3:35 AM I left my room, I went down the fire escape exit stairs next to my room to the ground and pulled my bags to the taxi stand nearby and departed for the airport to catch my flight, wondering if I would ever stay at the Excalibur Hotel again! In Summation: I am almost 70 and I look somewhat old , but I have 22 years of formal education and 25 years of technical education, very computer literate, and knowledgeable in many areas and very sharp mentally. I travel often. In my history of travel, I have never been treated the way I was treated on February 8th/9th by the staff of Excalibur Hotel. I felt I was disrespected, mistreated, and rudely accommodated by your staff due to circumstances I did not create! I found your staff ignorant, uncaring, rude, and unaccommodating. You should have a simple procedure in place for the immediate cleanup of a dry powder fire extinguisher discharged by idiotic guests, rather than evacuating and moving the whole wing of guests. I guarantee you it will happen again and again due to alcohol and stupidity combined! Where was your security and the cameras? Were the perpetrators apprehended? Why should I be severely inconvenienced by your lack of professionalism and poorly trained staff? I would like some answers to my questions concerning this matter. If I receive none from you, I will go to your General Manager for resolution and ask for your termination as the Guest Relations Representative. I have written to him previously with similar complaints and will attach that letter to this E-mail reply as an attachment. I look forward to your reply soon! In closing, I was very disappointed during my stay in February at the Excalibur Hotel due to the above circumstances! Sincerely, James E.

My mid-week, off-season rates were $30/night. For that price I got a recently-updated room plus all the amenities of a resort casino. What really sets Excalibur apart, however, is the ease of getting out to explore the other casinos on the Strip. You can visit Luxor and Mandalay Bay without even going outside, or easily walk to New York New York or MGM Grand in minutes. You can set out on foot to explore the Strip, or board the monorail at MGM to go downtown or stop at attractions along the way. Though still a fun medieval-style ambiance, I was a little disapointed that the roaming entertainers, like the jugglers and puppeters, have been replaced by hucksters selling vacation packages and show tickets. Like everywhere on the Strip, you have to learn to walk straight ahead and not make eye contact, or you will constantly be harrassed by people wanting to sell you something.

The hotel could be described as medieval and/or tired! after all you're supposed to be staying in a medieval hotel, so what do you expect? The rooms were spacious and clean, no problems with anything. The couple we went with stayed at MGM for 5 days and Bellagio for 2 days, and they still walked down to the Excalibur for the gambling. It cost us about \u00a3250 for a weeks stay, so go on, why stay in a more expensive hotel?

We had a standard room and it was huge by UK standards as was the en-suite (no bath just a massive shower). Two UK king size beds, flat screen tv, table and chairs, enough room for two couples to stay. Decor is a bit dated but as the title suggests we were only there to sleep. Worst part for us was the Las Vegas attitude to smoking. Every casino floor allowed it however the Excalibur turned a blind eye to it happening everywhere. Access and egress is largely through the casino so be prepared to smell like an ash tray every day. Despite other reviews I would recommend eating at the Roundtable. $25 each for all three meals, all you can eat buffet. Food was perfectly acceptable on every occasion we were there and plenty of it, choice and portion. If you want oppulance and staff falling at your feet then the Bellagio is up the strip but have your Platinum card ready. Worst part after the smoking is the continual harrasment every hundred yards or so of the free show offers. Nothing comes for free, it's a time share pitch with the promise of free shows and clubs. Even the free tickets we did get had a drinks minimum.

Service: The maids cleaned our room every day- no problems. Apart from our last day where the key no longer worked think we had been 'wiped out' too early which was frustrating. Pool: Fair do's the pool was good it was the main reason we booked this hotel as a lot of the other pools seem to be small/ in the shade. We were down the pool early and it was quiet during this time it got very busy later on in the day though. Restaurants: We had breakfast one day and tried a few of the places in the food court and they were all good- not gourmet by any means but this is not supposed to be a five star hotel. Bars: We didn't really drink in any of the bars- Dicks Last Resort seemed too loud and in your face for us- we mainly drunk whilst gambling anyway. Casino: The casino is very loud and is huge! We gambled a bit here but did most of the gambling at other casinos. We played a lot of slots here and had fun whilst doing so. The drinks service was pretty bad compared to the other hotels we went to- very slow. The casino was also a lot smokier than the others we enjoyed more Location: Not the best location on the strip but we loved all of the adjoining hotels and spent a lot of time at mandalay bay and Luxor which is all joined up by a long corridor. Next tim e we go we would probably stay at paris or Bally's which is more centrally located on the strip.

The layout of this resort is in stark contrast to the layouts of the Deluxe resorts in the way that it is all separate buildings not connected with a bit of walking involved. As anyone who has stayed in the deluxe resorts knows everything is connected under one roof (concierge, dining, photo-pass, gift shops, most amenities, etc). The Pepper Market @ C.S. is an awesome place to grab a bite to eat with loads of choices and delicious foods (loved and would recommend the goat cheese pizza). Coronado Springs also has a great gift shop.

I saw a standard room one of my friends was in and there was truly very little difference... just a little more space between the window and far bed allowing for a bit more furniture. The great thing about this place is probably how family friendly it seemed. I didn't have my kids with me but if I were to bring them to Vegas, this would probably be a good choice. They had kid activities and the pools looked great (too cold for me in December). The food court was okay. McDonald's seemed comparably priced to free standing McD's so I ate breakfast there pretty cheap a couple of times. The buffet was nothing to write home about and I was disappointed when I paid for the all day buffet and lunch and dinner were the exact same. The casino itself had a smell to it but I hate cigarette smoke so was probably just picking up on that and the age of the hotel. Favorite place by far in this casino was Dick's Last Resort.

Having been to vegas twice before over the last 2 years and having stayed at the Mirage and then the Encore, I was somewhat hesitant on taking the plunge in staying at the Excalibur. Though, I knew (at least perceptually) that it is one of the older hotels and that it had it's prime days some years before. Nonetheless, given the price points for our Fri-Mon stay, and the availability of renovated widescreen tv rooms, we went for it and booked a 2-bed room. Once checked in we went to our room on floor 27. Indeed we got our renovated widescreen tv 2-bed room and was relieved (you never know nowadays what you end up getting at hotels - 5 star or 1 star). The room was clean, bathroom was clean and still in pretty good shape post-renovation. Room is very basic with a 40+ flat screen on the wall (nice touch), somewhat small closet, and a good bathroom with a high granite counter, but just a shower (no bathtub). We paid the following for our stay there (excl resort fee of 9.95 per night): Friday: $76 Saturday: $76 Monday $41 Total was $249.59 for all 3 nights, incl taxes and resort fee. Surprisingly, we ended treating this trip as a \"budget\" trip to vegas, actually. I flew in via airmiles and therefore booked the hotel on its own (rather than via package, which is what we usually do). Here are some of the other things we thought were budget focused: - we bought a 3-day pass for the deuce (double decker bus) and took that all the time. it is slow (as most would say) but due to our race event, we wanted to conserve energy and the deuce really helped us with that. I almost always take the deuce while in vegas at least by the end of the trip since by then you've walked the heck out of your feet/legs anyway. - we noticed the \"gold line\" bus which is a double-extended bus that is express. it routes on the strip but stops at, say, every 2nd or 3rd hotel unlike the deuce that stops at nearly every hotel. this gold line actually takes you all the way to the premium outlets! having had to take the taxi before to those outlets, it was neat to find out that the gold line can now take you there at a fraction of the cost. that is, if you have the time. plus, the pass for the deuce works on the gold line. kudos to vegas on this one i must say. - we went to tix4tonight on 2 occasions. 1 for carnival world buffet at the rio (to carb up prior to the race), and they offered half off the normal price (instead of 30, $15). we figured that since the rio is off strip, that is why they had to lure ppl with a lower price point to go there. while at tix4tonight and buying these buffet tickets, we asked if taking the cab would be the usual way to get to the rio - the rep said, no, just take the shuttle at paris that goes to rio. we thought that was great. again, this just added to our budget style vegas trip. ironically, though, due to packing in too many things to do that day. there are also 2 other hotels that shuttle to the rio but i forgot which ones (ph could have been one of them). - so the rio's buffet in my opinion is the best one in vegas. i have been to the wynn buffet all 3 visits to vegas, and to the bellagio buffet once. bang for buck, even i had to pay full price at the rio buffet, it would still win. there were 6 or so regions of the world represented at the rio buffet and each region/buffet area had a good selection of food. service was good as well. - the second time we used tix4tonight was for a cirque show and we watched mystere at TI for $72 each, which i believe was $40 off regular price each. all cirque shows are fantastic, regardless of ticket price. I think that's about all I can mention for the time being.

I've never had a problem with noise or unruly guests on any of my stays, including my last trip when I arrived on Halloween evening. The front desk service is excellent, and on both occasions, they graciously provided me with additional dinner & drink coupons without my asking for them.

Lastly, don't worry at all about the relatively short distance from the usual trade show venues, as between the show shuttles, public transportation, or even for those who enjoy a good walk - even after visiting their very nice fitness center - it's really not an issue at all. Bottom line; for tight-budgeted, small-business travelers in this economy these days, the excellent, excellent value you get for staying at the Excalibur is refreshing.

Because of the fair room prices and its location, Excalibur became our traditional place to stay during the National Finals Rodeo until the Southpoint was built. We opted for the Southpoint for 2008-2009, but returned to Excalibur this year to be closer to the strip and away from the NFR buckle ceremony crowds. At Excalibur, two of the four towers are supposedly \"remodeled\" with the remaining two towers still containing older furnishings and decorating style. When making a reservation, the room description specifically delineates the difference between old and new decorated rooms, with the rooms priced accordingly. Wanting to ensure a clean room with the newest accoutrements (furnishings, decor, etc.) we opted for the highest priced room called the \"Wide Screen Deluxe Room\". Upon entering the room, I was appalled. A thick layer of white dust covered the dresser, desk and end tables, the supposedly remodeled furnishings literally looked like someone took a chain to the furniture they were so banged up and scratched. Even so, finger prints and smudges were evident under the dust. To our horror, the king size bedspread had a large stain on it with white crust around the edges of the stain. God only knows what that stain consisted of...I have a pretty good idea and it is sickening. The safe for valuables located inside the dresser was rickety at best. The roman shade and surrounding curtains were loose and did not block out all the light. The bathroom was extremely dusty, I could have written my name in the dust on the ice bucket and tissue holder. Hair resided under the sink cabinet and around the floorboards along with an evident black line of dirt. A phone call to housekeeping yielded prompt response and resulted in a room with no stain on the bedspread but no further cleanliness in my book. The shower? While an \u201cengineer\u201d was sent to repair the water flow, there was no change\u2026the water pressure was non-existent. It was so bad, I could not even wash my long hair as I would have never gotten the shampoo out. And to top it all off, the flat screen TV only sporadically worked. WE WERE JUST SO SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. What was once our favorite hotel has gone to the dogs or should I say the pigs? What's next, bed bugs? One thing is certain, when it comes to Excalibur we will never find out because this was a deal breaker.

When we got an answer we knew to be wrong or didn't like we would go back another time and often get the answer we wanted. Bottom line: our stay at the hotel was good and we recommend it due to the value price for rooms but we recommend you go close by to the MGM Grand or the NY NY or a ways out to the Ballagio or Mirage for a much better gamling experience.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "pusmes", "ReviewID": "UR88786452", "Content": "I've been stayed here for a couple of times.

It was our first trip to Vegas, and we loved it. It was a little far down the strip, but it's convenient that the Deuce stops right across the street to get down to the busy area. The check in staff was really nice, there was even a nice older guy who reminded me of my dad lol the room was clean, kind of dated but who cares. The shower was really big, but not much place to put your shampoos etc, other than the floor. The black out shades were really nice. We were in Tower 1 - the older renovated rooms, and had no problem with them. Just one piece of advice, I think the maids are used to guests leaving out gaming slips from vlt's as their tips, so I had left some out for just pennies to keep in the scrap book, but she took them. Not mad or anything, just didn't expect that. If you do spend time in the resort, watch the channel with the 702 scene stuff, it's really informative. We ate at the Sherwood Forest Cafe and absolutely loved it. I had the best French Onion soup ever at this place, and our waiter Stewart, was really great. He wasn't around constantly, and was really courteous whenever he was. When you're in there, you totally miss the hussle and bussle going on outside. We did also try the Last Resort Restaurant (since I can't put the full name on here), and it was totally different. Probably won't go back, but I knew what I was getting in to. When it came down to it, you were given what you wanted/needed, just not the normal kind of service. I never smelled cigarette smoke in the casino. All the casino's put this stuff in the air conditioning so it's got kind of a sweet smell. I don't think anyone can smell it unless you're super sensitive. Overall, we had a great time at Excalibur.

Straight away after booking Excalibur for 8 nights I then decided it would be wise to see what other people had said (i know, i did it backwards... my bad). What I found was a lot of negative reviews. The rooms smelt, far too many kids, its old and outdated, etc etc. So even before I arrived I was starting to feel like this would be a bad place to stay. All I can say is you really cant trust everything you hear. The room was exactly what it was meant to be, a bed, TV, awesome view of the luxor (20 something floor in tower 1), and a very decent bathroom. Although after a previous 2 weeks of staying at other places, Excalibur had the worst shower out of all of them, and being there for 8 nights this was a big disapointment. Did I get a terrible room as far as the shower went? Or is this the american standard for showers, and the Days inn I stayed at a few days before hand just manage to have an awesome shower? I dunno. All I know is when I got home I jumped straight into the shower :D. Since I was there the entire week I saw the families come and go. And yes Excalibur is known as very kid friendly, but it was really only on friday/saturdays that you really noticed swarms of kids running around... What I mean by swarms is only a handful. No big deal. Though I am not use to seeing them walking past gaming tables, big shock to me :) My biggest problem with Excalibur was its location. I felt more often then not I either had to fork out 10-15 for a taxi, or go and wait for the Duece, which most of the time was too packed to pick up, or late. So my piece of advice here is if you plan on travelling to vegas and seeing a bunch of shows like I did. Pick a hotel closer to those shows. The Gym was quite a nice edition. Certainly not going to get you into Mr Olympia, but a great way to get a bit of a pump up or undo a small amount of damage done the previous night ;) The Pool was closes both times that I used the gym so I didnt really get to see it in action. It was only closed because it was raining both those days (same reason why I was at the gym instead of cruising around the strip getting my burn on). Ok, last thing for my review is the staff service. Being someone who likes my sleep in's and privacy I left the do not disturb sign up then entire 8 days :D The staff took note of this and whenever they saw me offered fresh towels and anything else which was needed. Very polite. As goes for the bar, casino and valet. The only one I didnt find that pleasant was the bell desk. Would I stay here again? Doubtful. But not because of what Excalibur has to offer, it is a great casino/hotel. The problem is more that it feels more out of the way. Possibly just my way of thinking but I would much prefer be a bit more north of planet holiday.

I would rather say that I paid $24/night to stay at Excalibur than say that I paid $300/night to stay at the top resorts. The only thing you are limited to in Vegas is your hotel pool. Other than that you can access all of the attractions, restaurants, shows and casinos of any other hotel in the city. And Excalibur's pool isn't bad either. They have 4 pools and multiple hot tubs, a bar, a restaurant, cabanas, a water slide, an adult pool and cocktail servers just like every other hotel (with the exception of the few that have wave pools/lazy rivers). Give it a chance and you will enjoy your stay.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cwill not be back\u201d", "Author": "heathers44", "ReviewID": "UR84920150", "Content": "poor reception, very brisk unwelcoming booking ordeal at which they over charged us.

After reading reviews of Tower one I have to say I was more than a little weary but I needn't of worried, yes the furniture has seen better days but the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in.

The girl wouldn't directly answer some of our questions because we knew there was a catch somewhere so we declined and went to check-in. Check-in took about 10 minutes and we were given a widescreen room on a smoke-free floor which is what we had requested at booking (Tower 2 on the 24th floor). After checking in someone else tried to get us to come get our \"free\" gift (if you've been to Mexico & dealt with the timeshare people, this was very similar). We got to our room & it didn\u2019t smell like smoke, but smelled like very strong air freshener; I thought it would fade, but it never did during the 3 nights we were there. There was no comforter or blanket on the bed, just sheets which had multiple small holes in them. There were four pillows, three of which had stains on the pillowcases. One of the pillowcases had what looked like a large blood stain. I called housekeeping & requested some that weren\u2019t stained & those were brought up quickly. The bathroom had a large counter with one sink and a good-sized shower with hardly any water pressure. The shower head was caked with what looked to be lime/calcium deposits. I called and spoke with the manager the next day about that & the showerhead was replaced which helped some, but the water pressure still wasn\u2019t what I expect from a hotel. The room was also very dusty & the TV made a weird buzzing noise while on. While speaking with the manager I questioned him about the room because the widescreen rooms on the hotel\u2019s website are advertised as newly renovated & I couldn\u2019t see how this room was renovated. He basically argued with me that it was renovated; I would be terrified to see what the non-renovated rooms are like. My mom had a widescreen room on the 14th floor of Tower 2 & she had the same problems with the water pressure & stained linens. The bed was comfortable, but that is the only positive that I can come up with. Our room overlooked the pools & freeway & had very thin windows.

We found it was best to give them a call letting them know when you\u2019ll be heading out for a few hours so they have time to get in and out of your room. The casino was MUCH smokier/less ventilated than many other casinos we visited up and down the strip. Drink service was sparse.

Our favorite part of the hotel was definitely the pool and poolside bar/restaurant Drenched. Very reasonably priced food we thought....drinks not so much, but we expected that. You can however fix your own drinks up in your room (stop at a grocery/liquor store prior to checking into the hotel) and bring them down to the pool as long as they are in plastic containers. Food at Drenched was amazing-chicken tenders, waffles fries, etc made the perfect hangover-curing foods, and the drinks were very strong. The adults only pool was quiet and the waitress service was fine. Although it\u2019s located at the south end of the strip, the tram to Luxor/Mandalay was a nice touch and the easy access to the Deuce bus system (stops in front of pretty much every hotel) made traveling northbound on the strip bearable.

My wife and I picked Excalibur, even though there were some negative reviews, but we were optimistic. We were thrilled with our choice. 1) The hotel and casino were very clean. We stayed on a non-smoking floor, but there wasn't a smokey smell anywhere. I'm not sure if they have a new air system or what, but it was very pleasant. The room was plenty big enough as well. Typical size, bigger bathroom than I would have expected. 2) The food was very good, also. The buffet was a great deal ($30 to eat all day) We got our money's worth. We had a huge breakfast, lunch was several different entrees, Chinese, lots of fresh food, dinner was a huge selection, including sushi. During the day, if we wanted to take a break, we could simply walk in and grab something to drink and snack on and rest a few. We did not have a pricey meal in this hotel, but we ate food from the court at different times, and it was always fresh. 3) The casino was just right for us. The table games started at 5 dollar minimums during the day, and sometimes rose to 10 at night. Other hotels offer the same games with higher minimums. We walked to the Luxor, NYNY and MGM; the Excalibur always appeared to be busier, maybe for that very reason. With more people, the place was a lot more fun. Some of the dealers were personable, some not. The waitresses were all nice, and the comp drinks were very good. I'll list the negatives here, not just for Excalibur, but overall. My main complaint is the staff of the company pushing resort packages. They are set up at each entrance and approach you every single time you enter the casino. The first time you meet them, you think they work for the hotel, and of course, they don't bother to tell you different. They walk up, ask you if you are checking in and for how long, and usher you to a desk. Then you find out who they are. By the last day, I just held up a flat hand as I passed them. It felt rude, but you had to do it. They were a huge pain in. I did not run into any of them in the other hotels. It wasn't that they were pushy, they just approached you every time you passed them. Just hold up a hand or ignore them, just like you would the guys pushing the flyers on the street. 2) The tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay wasn't working all the time, not sure why. It rained one day while we were there, and that was the day it was shut down, so it may have had to do with the weather, but I'm not sure. When we did ride it, it was great. However, there is a moving walkway connecting Excalibur and Luxor, and it was very convienient and was running the whole trip. As far as negatives go...THAT WAS IT! My tips for a Vegas trip to Excalibur: Buy a daily bus pass. There were kiosks all over the place (we used the ones in front of MGM and Excalibur) and there were security guards there to help you figure out what you needed to buy. By the way, those security guys were extremely polite and very helpful. It costs $7 for a day, and there are two line it will work for: the Duece and the Gold Line. The Duece makes a lot more stops, so it can be very convienient, but will take longer if you plan on going farther. If you want to do some inexpensive shopping, take the Goldline South to the Outlet Center. Again, the buffet was a good deal. Try it for one day, and I think you'll agree. If you are looking for generic Vegas souvenirs (sp), walk around shop. The same ones can be found in Walgreens right down from MGM and for a fraction of the price. I hope this helps, and have fun on your trip.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chatham, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent - More than I ever Expected!\u201d", "Author": "blairs1", "ReviewID": "UR84490194", "Content": "Went to Vegas with Friends in late 2009 - and had booked a Vacation package through Delta Vacations.

I came back around noon and was granted an early check in. There was an issue with my booking (well, Excalibur couldn't find it - can't fault them, Delta couldn't find my flight reservation either). Delta had just went through their merger and apparently some packages were mixed up (double booked in the airline system but no tickets actually generated) - so I assumed this was just a case of calling Delta. I didn't even need to do that. Handed my paperwork over to the Check In Rep (not sure of his name) - and he took care of everything. He upgraded me from the normal Standard Room to a Widescreen (maybe a Widescreen Deluxe) room. I was pleasantly shocked at the size of the room, and how great it was. The bed was comfy, the TV was the perfect size and the bathroom was nice. Nice little meeting space off to the corner of the room, almost seperated.

We\u2019ve been to Las Vegas many times and have always stayed at a different hotel. We\u2019re not picky and when in Vegas are really only in the room to sleep and get ready for the day. We chose the Excaliber for the reasonable prices leading up to NYE (although, be sure to take the $10/night fee into account when comparing prices) \u2013 the price for our room the night of NYE was comparable to other hotels. We stayed in the new towers (thankfully) and traveled with another couple. There were quite a few issues we encountered. Oddly enough, the TV kept cutting out and shutting off while we were watching it. I know you don\u2019t go to Vegas for TV watching, but it\u2019s nice to at least catch the weather or the headline news. That\u2019s hard to do when your TV periodically shuts off. I made sure to call down to the front desk because I didn\u2019t want to be blamed at checkout for a TV that didn\u2019t work. I was told that the TVs weren\u2019t working because too many people were watching TV. Seriously?! Yeah, that\u2019s what I was told. The other couple we traveled with were on a different floor and didn\u2019t have the same problem as us. I guess no one was watching TV on their floor? Having a non-functioning TV in your Vegas hotel room is one thing that we could have dealt with (even though we booked the \u201cwidescreen room\u201d), but I really didn\u2019t appreciate the way we were spoken to and treated. If you have a room that\u2019s advertised by the TV, at least make sure the TV works! I understand there probably was nothing they could have done for us, but at least apologizing and telling me that although it sucks, they can\u2019t move us to another room and there\u2019s no one available to fix it (acknowledging the issue) would have been better than the curt response I got! Housekeeping: Food was left in the hallways for days (that must be where the cause of all the bugs I read about). We called down and asked for a comforter (although it was December, our bed did not have a comforter on the bed when we first arrived to the room), but were told we couldn't have one since we were on the 20th floor and comforters are only given to certain floors and below. Maybe they were trying to save money and under the assumption that since heat rises, it would be hotter on the upper floors and those guests wouldn\u2019t use the comforters, but if we called and asked for one, surely they had an extra we could use\u2026 Nope, we never got one; they definitely held their ground and my husband and I slept in sweatshirts under a sheet! We called 3 times during our first night to ask for a do not disturb sign. Each time they said they would send someone up. Not only was it was never delivered (not even when they cleaned the room periodically during our 5 day stay), but we were woken up by the housekeeper numerous times a morning (even after we told her we didn\u2019t need our room madeup). Also, when housekeeping was on our floor, I asked one of the women for an extra towel (we were only provided 2 and I wanted one for my hair) and she told me that she couldn't give me any since she only had 1 towel per room to give out and that we shouldn\u2019t use all the towels we were given during our stay. 5 days and you want 2 people to share 1 towel? I found this unsatisfactory, although, when I called to ask for the manager, I was treated as if I was asking for something very outlandish. Bell Desk: We had a late flight and left our luggage with the bell after checkout. When it was time to collect our luggage, we waited for 40 minutes and almost missed our flight. We stood in 2 lines (that didn\u2019t have more than 6 people in them) while we could see our luggage in the room. They switched staff a few times and took a long time asking for tips after retrieving luggage for guests. I asked if I could get it myself, but was told that for security purposes, I needed to stand in each line once. The manager could have cared less when we approached him with the problem! The staff really needs to act like they care about those who are staying at their hotel! There is absolutely no hospitality at this hotel! And, to top matters off, our friends that traveled with us received a flyer under their door everyday about the hotel happenings, we never did. They also received a packet of information regarding the hotel procedures for New Years Eve, we did not receive this. When I went to the front desk to ask for this information, they told me that the information didn\u2019t exist and that my friends must have made it up! PROS: The room and bathroom were large and very clean (initially) and the elevators were quick (they have express elevators taking you to the higher floors without stopping at the lower floors on the way). We had a nice big window that overlooked the NY skyline, which was very nice. The only time we could hear noise from the strip in our room was during the day on NYE and that\u2019s completely understandable (and who stays in their room in Vegas on NYE anyways?!). There were no bugs in our room. The food court is very convenient and there\u2019s interior moving walkways to both Luxor and Mandalay Bay. All in all, if you stay at the Excalibur, you\u2019re staying at a budget friendly hotel. These days, with the economy the way it is, you can find just as great deals somewhere else with a lot better customer service and nicer amenities!!", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay - Wide Screen room with a view\u201d", "Author": "kms61", "ReviewID": "UR84181677", "Content": "We stayed at the Excalibur Hotel for 2 nights in Sep this year with two boys 11 & 8. We had booked a widescreen room and asked for an upgrade to a Widescreen Room with a view. The upgrade cost us $10 per night, which we were very pleased with, Our room was in Tower 2 which was a short walk from reception thru the Casino. Our room was fantastic. Very roomy with two queen beds and a great view of New York New York and the strip. The room was very clean and beds extremely comfortable. We ate at the all you can eat Buffet (we only had Breakfast & Dinner, not the lunch) for $24.95 adults & $18.95 children. There was plenty of food and also a large variety to choose from. Our kids loved being able to go up and help themselves over and over again. The hotel smells a little smokey around the gaming area, but all the hotels we went into were similar. We used two of the 3 pools at the hotel and one had a waterslide which kept the kids amused. We read some great review and also some terrible reviews for this hotel, but I would definately stay there again if we returned, Staff were very helpful and restaurants at the hotel were fine. I took money out of a ATM Cash machine which apparently was empty, and it took the money out of my account but I didn't get the cash. The Hotel was very helpful and after looking into it, they sort it out very quickly and gave me the cash from the Cashier in the Casino. I particularly loved the \"Pearl Factory\" shop upstairs near the Buffet where tou pay $14.95 for an Oyster and get to keep the pearl inside. I was lucky enough to get 2 Blue Pearls, also 2 white & 1 pink pearl which we got set into Jewellery. Its a bit of fun, but could get expensive if you get addicted to it, like I did. Overall it is a great hotel to stay at and right near New York New York Hotel and MGM Grand.

The stay was fine, the casinos are all HUGE and you can easily get lost, so make sure you pack your sense of direction. The rooms were a good size and clean but no drinks facilities in the rooms. When we arrived there was a problem with a broken bedside lamp, but the maintenance man was in our room within about 5 minutes of calling to report the problem. The only downside was that there are Grandview timeshare people crawling all over the hotel. They constantly badger you, but once you learn to recognise them you can brush them off easily. We got nabbed before we even got to the registration desk and didn't realise it was a timeshare thing. After over 14 hours of travelling it was the last thing we needed and we signed up for the visit (2 hours, 2 and a half hours and then told at the end it wouldn't be more than 3 and a half hours) and handed over 40 dollars on the promise of getting it back, getting tickets for Lion King and 50 dollars for gambling in the hotel. Well, we met a couple who had been on the talk and they said they kept them for 5 and a half hours!! So we managed to get a refund by saying one of us was unwell and we just paid for show tickets and spent the day exploring the strip. They also said they never got their gambling money and had been promised something else we didn't and they didn't get that either.

Prior to our arrival we had used Tripadvisor and as such had booked Widescreen Rooms and again prior to arrival had requested a Strip View. This is all in addition to the basic room cost and you also have to add on a Resort Fee of approx $10 per day and the only useful part of the resort fee was that you got use of wired internet access in your room. Check in was a painless process and we then made our way through the Casino to our room. Our room was on the 25th floor and we had a good view of New York New York and the MGM. The room had a king size bed and a flat screen tv (we turned it on once for about 5 minutes during our stay) The bathroom had a large walk in shower but no bath, but then again I dont know many people who would have a bath on holiday! The room also has an iron, ironing board and an electronic safe. There are 3 lifts for floors up to the 17th floor and another 3 lifts for floors 18 upwards so generally you didnt have to wait long for an elevator. The rooms were cleaned to an acceptable standard and noise from the strip was audible but then again what would you expect in Vegas! The Casino is smokey at times but as we didnt really gamble that much I couldnt comment on the gaming. We ate in the food court and in the Sherwood Cafe and the food was good on all occassions. The hotel is connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay by walkways and by the monorail and it is a short walk to NYNY or the MGM where you can get the monorail up the strip. As has previously been mentioned the Timeshare folk can be very tiresome with the same person asking me on no less than 4 occassions in one day if I wanted to see a \"free\" show. Might be worthwhile wearing a Tshirt with \"I'm not wanting a free show thanks\" printed on it as they are at every entrance in the place!!! We also asked about booking a trip to the Grand Canyon with the Concierge in the hotel but they were about $70 per person more expensive than the stall at the Fashion Show Mall. All in all though I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to see Vegas on a budget and is prepared to walk or take transport to the other sights on the Strip. I would also recommend booking a Strip View room as the sight in the morning of the sunrising behind the Casinos is fantastic.

Also beware if you enter the buffet after 9.30pm you will not have a lot of time to choose and eat at a resonable pace, they close at 10pm. This caught us out big time. If you go to the buffet at Harrah's, Rio, Paris, palms, sahara, and two others, it costs 39.99$ and you can enter into any of that group any time of day so just go to the nearest when hungary In our opinion the hotel is a budget casino, needs a good spruce up, a little costly compared to others as you get no extra benefits like a club card for discounts like you do if you book else where. also the sherwood cafe charge $9 for a very weak vodka & coke, if you sit at a slot you can get the same for the dollar tip.

My shower drain was also so clogged up with what must have been *more* hair that it would quickly fill up with nasty, sudsy water (even before my soap got in there) up to the top of my feet.

The air condition kept on going back to its original temperature. Though i took 2 smoking rooms, but the stench was too much even for my husband who is a smoker himself. On the second day, I was greeted by 2 security officers in the afternoon after I returned from sight seeing.. They said that I used an electrical appliances which can be danger to the hotel. True enough I brought a small elctric cooker to the hotel but that is only to be used for boiling water for my baby as well as for cleaning up my baby's bottle.. I admit that I maybe wrong for using the electric cooker but the main reason as to why i am very UPSET is, the housekeeping staff actually entered my room without me knowing it although I place a PRIVACY TAG on the door. They have already intruded my privacy and to top that they also entered the other room too. DON'T they know the meaning of Do Not Disturb.. since both rooms has electric cooker we were told to bring it down to the reception counter for them to keep it till at night where they insist that we go down back to the reception to collect the appliances. The fact that they entered our rooms without permission makes me wonder how many other rooms with the privacy tag they could have entered without the customers knowledge..

I don't think it has deteriorated substantially. The obvious advantage is the price and the location. We got a really good deal and found ourselves in a good location, near to New York, New York and MGM. If you are complaining about the amenities here then think about what you paid - the hotel offers good value for the money they charge, although the resort tax does stick in the craw if you ask me. I suppose we are not typical Vegas visitors - we come here to see friends and family rather than to gamble and party, but this hotel did what we wanted it to do. We came with a 10 month old baby and she had a great time actually and in spite of what people claim, there is plenty to keep a young child happy and busy here. What I didn't like was the constant attempts to sell stuff at us within the hotel. I don't mind a little of this, but here it was pretty much non-stop. Walking from the elevators to the parking lot, we would usually be accosted about 3 or 4 times and it's hard to stay polite with these people I can tell you. I also thought the Sherwood Forest Cafe (don't worry, it's a short walk to Denny's) was terrible! Overpriced (to be expected) but long lines and poor service with very average food makes this a place to miss. Fear not though, there is a Baja Fresh here (give it a try if you're British and not used to Mexican food). One thing that surprised me was the amount of Brits here (too many for my liking as I am British and I come abroad to escape it!) - always easily identified of course by the bottles of beer in their hands at 7.30am.

You didn't have to go far to eat or anything. There was lots of things for everyone to do. My only complaints are that the pool is only open till 6 which kind of sucks since we were on a holiday and the fact that there is time share people all over the place.

The staff-Housekeeping, concierge, and valets were extremely friendly and helpful. I read some bad reviews on the cleanliness of the hotel, but I had no problems- it was made up daily and I always got a card with the name and phone number of our hotel maid. We stayed in Tower 1 which is way quieter than Tower 2 with a great view of the Luxor. This hotel was pretty family-friendly with a cool arcade level on the bottom, and shows and shops, and attractions that catered to families. Probably too much kids for visitors who are trying to have an adults' weekend out. We didn't mind. We had the breakfast buffet one day and it was just okay. I don't regret staying here.

PAY MORE FOR YOUR SANITY SOMEWHERE ELSE\u201d", "Author": "daisymay2", "ReviewID": "UR82477079", "Content": "Booked this hotel/flight with Alligiant from Bellingham 2 months before arriving. I called the day before arrival to ensure connecting rooms, as we were travelling with our daughter, son in law and 8 month old baby. 2 kings non smoking. Also wanted to set up a refrigerator to store the babies food. Extra cost was $20 a night. The person I spoke with directly at the hotel said everything was confirmed and I could pay for the fridge on arrival. Upon arrival , there was no connecting room. They don't gaurantee a reservation unless you call the day of. I said no one told me that and I just called the day before we left to ensure everything was taken care of. Big arguement about it at the check in. Finally she called a manager and together they went to the computer system to check. No adjoining. Can give you two queens in each room side by side but there will be no water on Tuesday for repairs. ARE YOU KIDDING? Back to the computer. The original desk clerk came back and said we have adjoining, 2 queens non smoking we moved someone else. Fine. Great. Get to our rooms. Yup we are adjoining, but NOT to each other. We join to someone else. LIvid. The furnishings are outdated old, worn, and sheets are stained, towels are fraying. The bathrooms are clean, but worn. Mirrors worn, old tiles, Sink doesn't drain, Blower dryer has been dropped a few times and missing parts. Table tops are stained . Taps in our daughters room were actually missing the chrome on both sides and they filled it with silicone. Hallways are dark and old looking. Food trays and items in the hall are left for days. I went to the desk and told them about the sink not draining. Also the shower was leaking at the tap. I said the shower worked fine for me, but for you the hotel to know you need to tighten the set screw for your own maintenance, not a big deal. Went out for the day. When we came back at 8 30 pm, my hubby went for a shower.. No handle, just a big hole in the wall now. Called down but the phone line was beeping the lite for a message. You have to move across the hall. Engineering issue in your room. We call down and say, what they hell? It only needed a set screw tightened. Not a new handle. They said you have to move. We said we don't want to move. You have to move. We will let you have a late check out at 3 pm for the inconvenience. Big whoop! So we start moving across the hall. 5 minutes later security comes up. (I guess they have cameras in the ceiling in the hall). What's going on here? You told us we had to move so were moving. He gets on his walkie talkie walking away from us and says, apparently we told them they have to move. No one assisted us. Someone had came up and dropped off a new room card that was it. The room was identical and still worn. Now though we were over the strip. NON stop traffic noise all night, sirens, aircraft noise and some band plays till 3 am in the morning and not even the a/c drowns it out. So I never slept until 3 -330 am when it got quieter, even though we were usually in by 1 am at the latest. Also the telephone message light was beeping in our new room. We pick it up. You have to move from your old room to this room. We will assist you with your move. Please call. Okay... We have already moved. Duh! We usually took our money with us where ever we went. However, one afternoon after the room was made up, we left my pack under the pillow and spent a couple of hours lying by the pool reading. I had counted the money the night before and that day we had only had breakfast. We were missing $400. I never said anything to the hotel as I can't prove it, but we did not leave any money there again. Food at the buffet was okay. The redemption machine at the casino never wanted to pay us , and we always got a ticket redirecting us to the cashier on the other side of the casino. The last day, I found out my daughter and hubby were not given the same 3 pm check out we were for the inconvenience of the shower, even though we were all travelling together. They had to pack all their stuff , including the baby items we rented and leave it all in our room. The hotel would not let them check out late when I called down. They went to check out. Came back with their bill, which was charged to my credit card even though I wasn't there and wasn't planning on paying all of that, but it wasn't okay to give them a late check out? Hmmm. We went to the Paris Cafe for lunch. It has reasonably priced good food. My daughter's family were going to shop , and we decided to go back to Excalibur and go to the pool for the last 1.5 hours before the check out. We gave my daughter one of the room keys when we left the Paris's restuarant. We stopped at some slots for 15 minutes on the way back. Went to our room and the key/card didn't work. We were on the 28th floor. Down the elevators. The security desk is right there. I asked if there was someway of contacting the front desk. He said yes the phone right here on the wall. I picked it up and took about 8 minutes to get someone. Meanwhile another couple talks to the security gaurd and they have the same problem. I am still on hold. I tell the gaurd I have the same problem that is why I am on the phone. The lady comes on the phone. I tell her the problem. You have to come to the desk front she says. As I watch the security guy pick up his phone and deal direct for the other couple whose card doesn't work either. I tell this to the lady on the phone. She says no you must come to the front. I hang up on her and go to the gaurd. He takes our room number and tells all 4 of us somewill will be up to our rooms momentarily. We got back up to our floor, 10 minutes later. No one. We are pissed. There goes pool time. I walk towards the elevators and see shadows and jingling around the corner. I ask the guy if he has keys for the room or if he is the guy we are waiting for. No he says. I can get you in. We tell him our problems, none too politely, but tell him we realize its not his problem. Now we can't leave the room as we have no way of getting back in. We call to the front desk, angry. Get transferred to Mary the manager. She says you have to have your card re keyed as they die at 12 oclock check out time. We told her 2 days ago you gave us late check out. You should know that. No you have to have them rekeyed. We said we have spoken to the front desk several times and no one told us that. I said the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing in this hotel. I said NO WAY am I paying a resort fee. She said its mandatory. I said I am not paying. All of the employees working here I said are brain dead. You just don't get it and I am not wasting my time speaking with you and hung up. Now we just waited until the kids showed back up from their shopping. Wasting our time and fuming. We went down to check out. No one at the counters for that. CLOSED. Only self check out. I went up to the counter and a guy and said I wanted to speak with a manger. I am he he says. I ranted about all the problems and I WAS NOT PAYING THERE RESORT fee as that would imply there was a resort of some kind. ITs manadatory he says pointing at the sign. We argue and I get frustrated. My thyroid problem has been bothering me since day one with all the problems here, (there are many more). He says I will take off 2 days fees. I said NO I AM NOT PAYING. Get your supervisor. Manager comes , same rig a ma roll. Finally after 10 minutes, he says . Okay I won't charge you the resort fees. I am like are you kidding me? That is what I asked you right off the bat and even you said it was mandatory. I said I AM Never coming back here or recommending it. ITS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND 4 days of STRESS.

We'd stayed here about 7 years ago and thought it was fine so booked on this basis but then began to panic when we read up on TA. However our worries were totally unfounded. The staff at check in were really friendly and helpful (we had a problem caused by our UK agent) but the Excalibur staff were great. We had booked a widescreen room which was modern, spotlessly clean and had an iron,ironing board, hairdryer,kingsize bed and decent sized wardrobe.It was also really quite. Room service was also available.The bathroom had granite surfaces and a big double shower. It was also spotless. If you get lucky you may even get a room with a view of the strip. The casino was fine. The cocktail waitresses came round frequently. People were friendly with a good atmosphere on the tables etc. There were plenty of food options incl pizza hut, mcdonalds, krispe kreme and quiznos for a quick meal/snack and there\u2019s also a buffet and seated steak restaurant if you want something a bit more substantial to eat. We tried Dicks last resort for a drink and its not a place I would have picked but we had great fun and its worth at least one drink there (although prepare to be insulted- I know it sounds awful but its hilarious). There were a few bars (one with live music) and a couple of shows going on . There are 4 pools (although none appeared to be over about 3ft deep) and we rented a cabana for $50 which inc widescreen tv, towels, free soft drinks and crisps and a host and cocktail waitress service (although alcohol was extra - between $25-$30 for bucket of buds/budlights (5 bottles) depending on whether happy hour or not) and I would definitely recommend hiring the use of one. The music round the pool was good and not too loud and we chose our cabana in the adults area (although the pools that allowed kids were relatively child free and seemed pretty quiet.). There was also a spa that did special offers quite regularly. There were people of all ages staying here and I'd say it would be comfortable for any age group. The location is good- you can walk to MGM, NYNY, Luxor, Mandalay bay and a cab to the mid strip area (Bellagio etc) was around $10 inc tip -although you could walk this in about 20-25 mins if its not too hot. We hired a car (as we also wanted to travel further afield) and the hotel (as did all the others we visited) had free parking If you\u2019re considering this hotel Id pay the $20 upgrade for a widescreen room and you'll have nothing to worry about. I cant comment on the standard rooms but if you book this room type I cant see you\u2019d have reason to complain. Ok its not the Bellagio but as one reviewer has previously said- If you want 5 star you need to pay 5 star prices.In the Uk we wouldn\u2019t even get a travelodge/premier inn room for the price we paid to stay here (For any US readers these are just a basic hotel -on a par with Motel 6 but without the pool!) So, if you\u2019ve already booked to stay here and have booked a widescreen room- dont worry. If you\u2019re considering staying here and you\u2019re after a modern clean room with good hotel amenities but would rather be spending most of your money on gambling/eating and drinking and being entertained then a w/s room at the Excalibur is a good choice. Id definitely go back.

The bar is a little expensive, I had one pina colada for $10, but that all I needed, they use 100 proof rum so one was enough. It was nice that they had a food court in the building which we partaked in the yummy Krispy Kreme donuts, pizza hut and McDonalds.

They put us on the 13th floor. Ok, not a problem. We went to bed a little early like midnight since we traveled all day. At around 3:15am, I awoke to yelling and pounding on the wall! These guys in the next room were in a fist fight and using all kinds of words I'm sure would not make their momma's proud. And it just got worse so I called the front desk and told them. I dont think they came up since they just kept it up. So the next night which was the night before my wedding, at midnight, the same rats next door decided to throw a drug party! The smell was in our room and the hall. I had enough and went down to the registration and told them what was going on and told them I wanted a new room or them kicked out. Well, the manager ignored me and looked at me like I was a complete idiot and I was bothering her. They moved us to the 2nd floor and told us we had 30 min to move rooms. Mind you, I had my dress, makeup, everything ready for the next morning set out. So we went all the way through the casino back to our 13th floor and low and behold, our key was shut off! So now we are pretty mad and went back down, through the whole damn casino and they were like, opps, sorry. A security guard will meet you at your room. So back up we went and there was a older man in a security outfit. I let him have it about the drug party and screaming going on and he said oh yeah, I hear that. I told him \"can't you smell the drugs\" and he said he could and is suprised they were not kicked out last night. So I asked what he was going to do? He just looked at me with a duhhhh look and did NOTHING! So we packed up all our stuff, or I should say threw it in bags and down to the 2nd floor all the way to the end and around the hall. They never did anything to the drug infested room next to us even though other guests were complaining. The halls were filthy. There were used q-tips and travel size shampoos on the floor. The customer service sucked. Since it was my wedding I kept my mouth shut for the most part. They did nothing to accomidate us but get us a new room. By the time we got in and settled, it was 2am.

We stayed in floor 22 in Tower 1 so that was an issue. We simply locked our valuables in our luggage using our luggage lock. The other security issue is the fact that security does not ask guests to show their room keys; they have a stand setup for them to do so but they do not ask.

The fact that I was apprached by a pimp, and repeatadly asked for business, while I was with a casino attendent does not make me think that Excalibur attempts to keep this type of clientale away from the Casino floor.

I waited a little more than half an hour and then asked for an ETA. The customer support representative was unable to provide an ETA, so I requested that the technician be sent the next day sometime after 9 AM, since I needed to go to sleep.

For $31/ night I was very pleased. You should note that a $10/day resort fee is also charged upon check-in. Since I was expecting this it didn't upset me, but I could see how it might if was a surprise. Several hotels on the Strip tack on this fee. I have stayed at several Strip hotels in the past and my Excalibur room was comparable to a basic room at MGM or New York New York. It was certainly nicer than a basic pyramid room at the Luxor. I was pleasantly surprised. Service at the Excalibur during my stay was fine. Check-in/Out was very fast and the desk personel were pleasant. My gambling consisted of playing Poker at the MGM, so I can't comment on the casino staff at Excalibur. On past trips they have not been that great though. Because it wasn't very busy, the smoke levels in the casino weren't that bad. During busy times however, I'm sure it could get pretty cloudy. The casino itself is a little outdated and does not have very good ventilation. The pool area has been improved fairly recently and suited my needs just fine. The adult only pool was very relaxing with lots of space and uncrowded. There is a hot tub right next to the pool which made for a nice transition from hot to cold. There is also shallow area to the adult pool that allows you to sun bathe like a beached whale if you like. Not the fanciest of towels are distributed as you enter the pool area and I thought the poolside chairs are a little old and worn out. The pools and pool decks looked new and clean and well maintained. There are nice view of the Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay from the pool. As far as restaurants go, there is a food court which is fine for a simple meal. There is also a Baja Fresh right at the bottom of the elevators to Tower 2. For a nicer meal I would go elsewhere. In summary, for the $31 price it was a fantasic hotel, at least when it is not crowded. I suspect that the staff may get overrun when it is busy and service suffers.

With that in mind, remember that you get what you pay for. If you want a higher-end hotel, you have to be willing to pay for it. We were staying just one night in Las Vegas and didn't feel compelled to invest much money in that. We spent most of our time at the Excalibur with our tongues planted firmly in our cheeks. It is a hilarious place to stay if you keep your expectations in line with its low rates. First, the rooms are so outdated you have to laugh. I haven't seen furniture or wallpaper like that since 1975. The place was built in 1990, so you have to wonder where they found it in the first place. The wall sconces were gilded torches with hands gripping them. Even the TV stand had a neo-Gothic design. Sort of. Second, any medieval themes that remain in the place are only to be found in the rooms. We didn't observe much decor around the common areas of the hotel that appeared medieval in nature. It mostly seems to revolve around Dick's Last Resort, which has a restaurant on site, and \"Thunder from Down Under,\" which is an Australian \"adult\" show. When I hear the phrase \"thunder from down under,\" I don't think of strippers first, but evidently the Excalibur does. I should mention that the comedian Carrot Top was also on site while we were there. I can't remember the last time I saw his name anywhere. Third, I've stayed in good hotels, and I've stayed in cheap hotels. But this is the first time I've stayed someplace that only provided one bar of soap in the bathroom. Fourth, if men in dark blue blazers approach you, just say \"no\" and walk away quickly. They will leave you alone. Woe to the person who says \"yes\" and has to stand there for the sales pitch. On the more serious side, the room was clean enough, but you could tell the bedspreads and carpet had been there for a LONG time. Some reviewers have mentioned the clientele being mostly young adults. We found it to be mixed -- some couples, some families, some young adults. The registration process went quite well despite the long line. The elevators were efficient. Food was about as expensive as you'd expect. If you're staying longer, it might be worthwhile to buy the all-day buffet pass. The pool area was better than expected. The common areas of the hotel were not as clean as you might expect. We walked past one pool of vomit in the casino area. You may see bleached patches of carpet in the hallways. It's pretty obvious what probably happened there, but the bleach stains are unfortunate. There was trash left on a table in front of the elevators. The hotel maids had been walking through that area, so it's unclear why the trash remained on that table from the afternoon we arrived until the morning we departed. If you don't like cigarette smoke, walking through the casino will bother you. If you take your kids to the arcade, be aware that about one-third of the arcade games were either nonfunctioning or not functioning as they should have. Normally, you might expect a hotel this size to be of higher quality. But just remember that you get what you pay for. If you're paying a lower-end rate, you're probably going to get a lower-end hotel.

Just because one patron says they were bothered by kids running in the halls all night doesn't mean everyone will have that experience. The walls were not too thin in my opinion, but were rather sturdy feeling actually. I was on the eighth floor of Tower II. I did have a little \"trepidation\" about staying here due to some of the bad reviews I must admit, but I guess I was lucky or something because I had a great seven-night stay! Check In: Check in lines were long, but seemed to be moving \"fairly\" quickly. I however checked in at the VIP desk, which anyone can do if they are an \"invited\" casino guest, such as one who has received coupons for discounted rooms in the mail as I did. Took me about five minutes to be waited on, and the comp room I got (for three nights) was on the eighth floor of Tower II, and had a decent, though not spectacular view of the Strip. Room: My Tower II room on the eighth floor was indeed an updated \"Widescreen\" room, and though the furniture was showing some wear (nicks, scrapes, etc.) everything, including the comfy chair, seemed very clean. The Internet worked as expected and is included in the mandatory \"resort fee.\" AC worked just GREAT. I could cool the room down to 67 degrees if I wanted to, and it was over 100 degrees outside each day I was there. I wasn't thrilled that it blew towards the BED though, but that was fixed by moving a chair in front of the vent to deflect the air. The bathroom has PLENTY of counter space, and a magnified make up mirror with a light right above if for the ladies. The one sink is of the very \"deep\" variety, which I thought was great. Heck, you could do laundry in that sink if you wanted to. Nice and deep. Shower, as others have said, had only adequate water pressure, but it was plenty to get clean. If you want real water pressure, try the Mirage Hotel further down the strip. Great showers there! The bed was definitely on the firm side, but frankly I liked it and slept just fine. I had NO problems with noisy neighbors, kids, maids, etc. during my week long stay..which included the weekend. Maid service was excellent in my view. I did not tip them during my stay, but left her $25 on check out day. Even without a daily tip (which I rarely do) they kept the room clean the entire week. I asked the maid not to replace the bedspread every time she made the bed, and she didn't. That way I didn't have to remove it every night. Gym: I went in to check out the gym. It's actually pretty nice for a hotel gym. There are adequate free weights (on barbells) and also a good selection of dumbbells. A \"bench press machine\" is also included, though it is not your standard bench press bench. There is also adequate cardio equipment, most have T.V.'s on them as well. The view out the window is of the pool area, which is nice. I did not check out the spa, but the gym itself (workout room) is included in the mandatory resort fee of $9.95 per day. Casino: I like this casino, or at least most of it. It's just got a good \"atmosphere\" in the slots area, which I liked immensely. A little \"happier\" than some other casinos I've been to. The one thing I really don't like is the \"party pit\" on the weekends. I'm a craps player for the most part, and one of the craps tables borders the party pit, and on the weekends it gets VERY noisy what with the loud dance music and the band in Dick's Last Resort (which is right past the party pit.) Even if I were 21 I\"m not sure I would enjoy playing blackjack or craps or anything else in or near this party pit. Frankly, the dancers were only \"so-so\" anyway. They have better dancers at the Golden Gate downtown in my opinion, or even at the MGM. Maybe I was just not there on \"Babe Night\" I don't know, but I wasn't that impressed. On the weeknights the party pit is closed, so noise is no problem, but on the weekends they actually raise the table minimums to $10 on the front craps tables in an effort to herd people to the back of the casino where they have an additional three tables in a much quieter atmosphere. They do this because it's even hard for the craps dealers to work in this environment. I could always find a $5 game of craps in this casino, and the Tropicana across the street as well. Even on the weekend. I also found $5 craps at NY NY most of the week, including some on the weekend if it wasn't crowded. I did not look that much for blackjack table minimums but assume they were $5 as well, at least at the Excalibur. They have some interesting new slots in the Excalibur as well, and I found most of the slots I played to be somewhat \"loose\" though if they stopped paying off, or didn't pay off after ten or so pulls I would switch machines. I probably put about $1200 through their slot machines while I was there and so gave them a good test run. I won $400 on a dollar machine after just a few pulls, then another $300 on the same machine. I had similar experiences on some of the other machines, but didn't always win of course. I also found the machine at the Tropicana across the street to be loose as well, even the Wheel of Fortune machines, which are usually NOT very loose. If I were just playing slots, I'd head over to the Trop instead of Excalibur, but both were pretty good in my opinion. Poker Room: The poker room is towards the back of the casino, and is \"open\" to the casino, with only a short \"wall\" separating it from the casino. Not a bad place for beginners to learn to play in my opinion. Most of the players are friendly, and they have poker lessons every day at 11:00 am. I partook of the lessons, and then got taken at an actual game later ha ha! They have $3-$6 limit games most of the time, and also $2-$4 occasionally. There are also \"no limit\" games. Drink service in the poker room was adequate, but not spectacular. Dealers are friendly for the most part. Poker room is located near the sports book. Food: I ate mostly at the fast food joints in Excalibur, but did try the buffet a couple of times as well. I found the buffet to be about average, not horrible like some folks have been saying. I also went BETWEEN \"rush hours\" and so rarely had to wait in line at all. If you time it right, you will not have to stand in line very long. I also ate at Pizza Hut and McDonald's. I think McDonald's is the only thing open after midnight, other than the 24-hour room service (which I did not try.) For a \"good\" restaurant I hoofed it across the street to NY NY or MGM. They both have some nice restaurants. Staff: I found most of the staff to be excellent, including the craps dealers, front desk, pit bosses etc. There was a rather glaring exception however at the bar next to the sports book. I had been drinking heavily (ha ha!) for the past two days, and had ALWAYS been able to get my preferred mixed drink in one of those \"bucket\" or \"rocks\" glasses, but one night when I went there the bartender was very adamant, to the point of being rude, that his bar had no such glasses. He refused to even go look in the back for one, even though the matches they had in a glass on the bar had been placed in such a glass. This was a white guy, and not the excellent Mexican bartenders who had been working there the previous two nights. If I could remember his name I would post it here, but alas, I can't...lucky him. I proceeded to leave the bar without my drink that night. I actually headed over to the Trop across the street and played THERE all night, and drank, and actually won a few hundred bucks. I made a point of telling the bartender at the Excalibur that the next time I saw him. He was unimpressed of course ha ha, because he just doesn't care about anything apparently, including customer service. Time Share People: Yes, they are there, and yes, they bug people. However they NEVER once bugged me. Why? Because I was there by myself! Tip: They will only usually approach COUPLES, not singles or groups of people. If you can separate from your wife or hubby for just a few seconds while you walk by their desk, you will not be hassled. Their desk is strategically located as you exit the casino going towards the elevators to your rooms. The casino narrows at this point so there isn't much room to run ha ha! Overall: I would stay at the Excalibur again. I liked the room, the casino atmosphere was great (minus the party pit,) and MOST of the people that worked there were great too. The place was NOT overrun with kids, though there were certainly plenty present. The maid told me that the week before I arrived the place HAD been overrun with a bunch of kids there for a basketball tourney or something. She said she'd had to tell them numerous times to not bounce their basketballs up and down the hallways at night and early in the morning. Had I been there THAT week, I think I would have had some complaints about the noise for sure, but again; lucky me I guess.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hungary, Budapest", "Title": "\u201cGood value but there are two qualities or the rooms\u201d", "Author": "hrefa", "ReviewID": "UR74215427", "Content": "Good value for the money.

I had originally stayed there 15 years ago and found the service to be terrible. I felt that they were understaffed everywhere except the casino. In subsequent visits I have stayed elsewhere. This time however I was travelling with a 4 and 6 year old. We needed to stay at a family friendly hotel that was reasonably priced. The Excalibur fits this need perfectly. I did however tell my better half not to expect much, that the hotel was a \u201cdump\u201d and that we\u2019d get poor service. My negative expectations were not born out by reality. There was a long line at check in but they had a lot of front desk people on and it went very quickly. We paid $86 for a room and were very happy. It had been upgraded and contained a flat screen t.v., marble countertops and a large tiled shower. We also found the service elsewhere to be friendly and efficient. This hotel also has a lot of attached franchises such as McDonalds and ice cream stores that were perfect for our needs. My kids loved the pools and the Kings Tournament night show. On the way back from San Diego we also stopped in Vegas. We had heard great things about the swimming areas at Mandalay Bay and the MGM but we were unsure about how kid friendly they would be. We decided to stay at the Excalibur again and upgraded our room for an extra $16. I assumed the really low priced rooms would be the old un renovated ones. This time however our room was an exercise in contrast. It also had a flat screen, marble countertops etc but was filled with worn and tired looking furniture. The dresser looked like it had been picked up in a garage sale after being used in a kids room for 15 years and the bed spread was torn and repaired in multiple places. Why renovate a room, charge extra for it and then fill it with furniture and bedding that are many years old? It just leaves a poor impression. Despite this however I\u2019m giving the Excalibur a good rating. I find so often on Trip Advisor people review a hotel as if it is always a 5 star. This is not the Wynn. The room was not $500/night it was only $90 and the Excalibur is a 3 STAR HOTEL. On so so many reviews people pay much less and then complain about a 3 star being a 3 star. The Excalibur is one of the cheapest large hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, our kids had fun staying in \u201ca castle\u201d and so did we. P.S. The pool does close ridiculously early and I too am very very tired of having extra charges such as the \u201cresort fee\u201d added to the price of the room by hotels.

No way to sit and work on my laptop even if I COULD get a connection working; c) The internet connections did not work; I work in the industry, I know all the tricks for getting it to work, it did not work in this room. d) The phone was across the room, and cord was too short to reach across the room to call the Internet service provider while also looking at my laptop, and e) there was no soap so I could not wash my hands after going the bathroom.

If I pay for a two-star motel, I don't expect four star amenities. But no matter what, I think customers have a few basic rights 1) decent service, 2) a reasonably clean room 3) things in the room should work. Excalibur struck out on all three. First, we made reservations for three rooms through Vegas.com, under my name, and that of my mother in law and my wife's aunt. The hotel managed to screw up the reservation and reserve two of the rooms under my mother in law's name; fortunately I had the paperwork from Vegas.com to prove I had the reservation under the right name, but it took a manager to over-ride the erroneous entry. When we got to our room, the electronic keys didn't work, so we had to trudge back downstairs to have them reprogrammed. They worked, but it was hit and miss for the rest of the stay. Second, the rooms themselves were small, drab, and dirty, furnished with what looked like Motel 6 cast-offs. The room had two beds but one small nightstand between them with a puny under-powered lamp. There was a mysterious sticky spot on the rug. The bathroom appeared clean, but I noticed a small vent fan on the wall, with a pull-out filter, which read, \"Must be Changed Every 6 Months\". Just for the heck of it I pulled out the filter and yikes! It was full of lint, dust and who knows what else. The fan itself was so overloaded with crud I didn't turn it on for fear of starting a fire. Third, the room safe didn't work. Fourth, there was a security guard station in the first floor elevator lobby with a sign that read \"Your security is important to us. Please present your room key.\" The station was un-staffed most of the time, even late at night. Finally, the whole place looked and smelled very worn out and run down.

It is totaly inappropriate & in my opinion, unacceptable for that area of the hotel. Another 10 steps away at the main entrance is a trellis where photos can be taken. We observered a classless female bent over with a man stradling behind simulating an act again totally inappropriate for a public entry. Final straw was the the TV in their highly marketed 'widescreen room' automatically turns on at room entry. It runs advertising, including porn ads showing women in underwear in sexual poses. The TV remote was missing and the channel controls were disabled so we couldn't even watch \"family friendly\" TV, but rather had to power it off altogether. Other problems were that the room window was open slightly when we arrived only to learn it would not shut completely or engage the lock. Being on the 24th floor, this was less than pleasing and had to be a code violation. Finally, the hallway noise kept us up most of the night. Every time the nearby door would shut or guests would walk down the hall, we could hear it as if right in our room. Was really unpleasant to hear the drunken guests full of profanity all night.

While we were able to find an area of the pool where children could play without seeing the beer pong stuper AND the Tournament of Kings was family friendly, it wasn't worth the other distasteful surprises. Being an older hotel, it also requires passing directly through the casino to get to the tower room entrances. Unfortunately, smoking is allowed in the casino making it impossible to get in/out without traversing a cloud of smoke.

We had never been to Vegas, so I booked on Vegas.com and chose Excalibur for its claim to be pushing for a more adult crowd. They advertised an adult only, relaxation pool. What a joke! The DJ was pumping out the tunes so loud, that you could not even think. 4 pools, and they were all basically crawling with under 18 and 18-20 that were there to drink and party. Cans and plastic cups thrown to the ground when finished, and don't even get me started on the smoking both in the casino and at the pool, and everywhere else. My wife and I were bothered at the number of families at this casino who brought there children to the casino with them. I know that it is a casino, but not the place to bring your family. Vegas.com bookings apparently don't get the best rooms...no kidding. Our first room just had a bad vibe to it; check-in claims they \"upgraded\" us even though I had booked a widescreen tower room through the website. View was of the back of the castle spirals, and an alcove where some workers set up chairs to take a break. If this was one of the new upgraded rooms, Excalibur has failed miserably. I have stayed at older Holiday Inns that had better decor. We upgraded on Sunday night for $10 and got a much better view with basically the same decor. However, we just could'nt get passed the noise, smoke, and lower class guests at this place. The hallways were littered with debris and room service carts. Believe the reviews that say the carts stay in the hallway for up to three days. We saw them. If you ask housekeeping for extra towels, they tell you they only have sheets, you need to call for towels ??????? Obviously someone else is responsible for cleaning up room service carts, room cleaners only touched the rooms. We ended up lasting about three nights and then I chose to book at Luxor for remaining duration of our vacation. The only bright spot in our stay at the Exalibur was the Camelot Steakhouse. Great service, great meal. One example of rude service I witnessed was a Japanese man trying to get the $4 beer and hot dog deal from a casino bar, only to be harshly told he had to get his wife and child in stroller out of the gaming area. We we about 50 feet from the nearest gaming table that was operating, and his wife and child were another 10 feet away from that. And this while we personally had seen families gathered around one person playing a slot machine on several occasions that weekend. Maybe the bartender was just racist because the man did not speak English very well. Luxor was better updated, friendlier service, less smoke (better filtration) and less noise. There were still families with young children here, but about 1/10th compared to Excalibur. Overall it was a much better set up. We finally got to enjoy ourselves more at Luxor. Pool area was fine until Friday 1 PM when DJ showed up to blast tunes. We got up and left area, knowing what was probably coming. I realize Vegas is all about excess and partying, but don't advertise relaxation. I should have bit the bullet and booked at a more upscale hotel such as Bellagio or Ceasar's.

We were due to check out on Sunday at 11, however after being out til 3 am for my reunion I was very tired. I called the front desk and asked if they offered a late check out and they said yes for an additional $20 we could stay until 3pm...SOLD!!!!

He was right..our cab total was $11 and we tipped him $5...still less than the $24 for a shuttle. I was very satisfied with the Excalibur and would recommend it to my friends.

Being Indians,the eating options in the lobby and first floor are good.we had a good variety of Pizza Hut , Baja Fresh (mexican) which reminds us of our typical rajma rice , good taste , Sandwiches at a Sub kind a joint.Starbucks for hot coffee and tea , So food wasnt a problem for us @Excalibur.The hotel room rate included only stay and no coffee vending machine or microwave which was a bit disappointing . In and around the hotel there are very plush casino's like Luxor, MGM Grand , New York New York making the Strip accessible too ...they are all walkable distances from Excalibur. 1 mile away and we can reach Hard Rock cafe which also offers good food and beverages, Now coming to the hard part of it -We signed up for Spa service treatment at this hotel for the 2 of us.unfortunately due to some unforseen appointment we had to move our appointment to 4.30 from 3,30 ,some gentlemen at the Spa mentioned that its moved to 4.30 and we needed to check in however at 4pm .However we got a bit delayed and reached the SPA at 4.32 pm and also apologised. to our dismay the staff had already charged me a no show cancellation fee of 50 USD ! and that too my slot was originally at 4pm ...now this was something we hadnt called for.Inspite of several requests to take a late treatment at the same rate -the mgmt was bit rude and they werent even apologitic until we made them realise it.and they charged both of us eventually a no show cancellation fee of 50 USD.and they also mentioned that whatever time was left cannot be availed due to the staff having to leave at sharp 5.Now this is what is cust dissatisfaction.We were quite upset and tried to escalate to their mgmt but no use.we were told that we could provide feedback on their website post our stay.

Fremont Street is worth a look even if its just to see the Light Show. There are walkways connecting the Excalibur to the Luxor and Mandalay hotels which are worth a look.

Excalibur - Lively hotel!\u201d", "Author": "RoxMoz", "ReviewID": "UR68736220", "Content": "My husband and I travelled to LV in May 2010 to celebrate my 30th birthday. This was our second attempt at our holiday following the volcano disruption. Although I'd read travel guides I didn't really know what to expect. I guess the best way to describe LV is a 24-hour party place! Great holiday. We stayed for 7 nights and could have stayed longer if money wasn't an issue - lots to do in LV itself - each casino is a holiday on it's own. Plus lots of excursions you can book on. (May weather ideal!) Hotel: The Excalibur is in an ideal location on the Strip, in-between the Luxor and NY. Originally we were supposed to stay at Circus Circus but the Excalibur was definitely a better location. The hotel itself, like all the others, is massive. Several bars and fast food restaurants. There was lots of choice on the buffet but very similar to an all-inclusive holiday - you wouldn't want to eat in there everyday. The Italian restaurant advertised in the brochures was closed all week - one of the staff told us it was because no one ever booked in there. The staff in the hotel were all very helpful I must say. Nice pool area - very clean and although it was busy we didn't struggle to get sun loungers. I would say the casino in this hotel was the busiest casino in Vegas. Can get smoky but they all do. The room was clean and comfortable and we had great views (floor 23). Make sure you try and see as many as the hotels as you can. I can\u2019t describe how big they are \u2013 some with malls inside. 2 tips I wish we knew about before we went: When we got to the hotel with our cases, we were greeted by what we thought was a member of check-in staff. He took us over to a counter next to reception and asked us if we wanted to see a free show. Luckily my husband was on the ball because these folk try to sell timeshares - you'll get a discounted show if you sit thought a 2-hour sales pitch. Don't be fooled! And it turns out these 'time share people' are everywhere in Vegas, especially in the hotels. Handy tip, if you don't wanted to be pestered walk past them on your own - they only seemed to bother us when we walked past as a couple. Other tip - drinks can work out expensive compared to UK when you buy at the bar. Put a $1 note in a machine - play 1 cent at a time very slowly and a cocktail waitress will ask if you want a drink. Wait until she comes back with your drinks, tip her a dollar and there you go - cheap round of drinks! And you might even win on the machine haha. Same in all the hotels. The machines pay out in \u2018vouchers\u2019 now so if you have any money left and don\u2019t want to carry on playing, print the \u2018cash out\u2019 voucher and cash it in or save it for another machine. In terms of trips, we did a trip to the Canyon - a definite must see. We booked through hotel concierge. The company who did our tour was Adventure Photo Tours. They were great I must say. I only wish we had enough money to book on the Hollywood tour too - but there was too much to do in Vegas anyway. Also, get on a bus and go to downtown Vegas. You can buy cheap all day tickets and it is definitely worth seeing. Bit shady to walk there though. Views from the Stratosphere are worth a look too.

We arrive to our room and we see two double beds, not the king size bed we specifically asked for. When we called downstairs they said there was nothing they could do because they didn't have any left..BULL. You have XXXXX amount of room and it's Wednesday! The bathroom was not cleaned fully either. We were on a \"non-smoking\" floor but had to keep the AC on 24/7 to keep out the smoke smell. It had 3 really nice pools and NO where to sit because they let everyone off the street visit them. So people who actually paid for the ammenities of the hotel couldn't enjoy it. Next time I visit Las Vegas it will be in a regular hotel that doesn't have a casino under it and you need a room key to gain access to the pool.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLooks impressive from the outside, inside not so great\u201d", "Author": "Mimiwu", "ReviewID": "UR64268270", "Content": "At the end of the new strip, good if you want to visit the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign but a LONG walk to the heart of the action (Ceasers, Bellagio & all the shopping etc).

It just didn't seem to fit the gaudy decor on the exterior and I was happy for that. There sports book was probably one of the best we hung out at. It had very comfortable seats and plenty of TVs to watch all the games. Since it is holed off in a corner it unfortunately doesn't have the best ventilation. The gaming tables were okay and I like that they often had $5 craps tables available. Most of the other MGM casinos like to keep it up at $10 most of the time. Our room was in the older tower and was fine except for the water pressure. It would have probably been more of an issue if it wasn't just us guys and we had intentions of hanging out there for more than just sleeping, but we dealt with it.

The main thing was that it was very clean and the maids did a good job everyday on keeping it that way. The only problem we did come across was that, as it was very windy when we visited, that the wind blowing against the window was very noisey at times. Other than that a good stay in that room. 2 nights before the end of our stay we decided to upgrade to a spa room for $75 each night. This room was absolutely fantastic. Again, very clean & well kept. I was in my element with a brilliant view of the strip (New York, New York, MGM Grand...) and the hot tub was just perfect at the end of a days walking & sightseeing. The spa room was in tower 2 (1st room was tower 1) tower 2 is newer and not dated like the first. I would recommend upgrading to anyone who stays at the Excalibur.

First of all let me start by saying this, the widescreen rooms are the way to go, they are remodeled and are very roomy. We paid $46 a night, $10 more than their standard rooms, but it's money well spent. If you want to complaint try the Sahara and you'll see that the Excalibur IS a great bargain. Service, this is our second stay at Excalibur and both times we never had any issues. We approached everyone with a smile and used a polite tone and they got things done for us in a very timely manner. You people need to realize that these folks do a very thankless job for the most part and they appreciate this. We had NO issues with service here, our toilet got clogged they came and fixed it within 20 minutes. Rooms were cleaned everyday, and as mentioned before, for what we paid per night we got what we expected. People complaint about it not being kid friendly, people, its Vegas not Disney, they will do the best job they can for kids but they are in the Casino business. Be logical. Yes there is smoke, yes it is loud and yes they have a kid\u2019s pool. If you don't want to stay here with your kids may I recommend a spot off the strip, or the new resorts in City Center, Aria, Vdara... etc. The resort fee... well, accept it because every other hotel is charging it. So don't complain about it. I can understand if they were the only ones doing it. If you do your homework and looked on their website you will see that the resort fee does show up, they also explain what it is for on the website. So don't sound shocked when you see it there. All in all, it's a great place to go and sleep, because in Vegas that's all you'll need a hotel room for. My advice, spend the extra on the widescreen rooms, the beds and pillows are comfy, rooms are big enough. Be polite and you will get served. And the best tip for being served better than all the other guests\u2026 TIP. It\u2019s up to you who you tip and how much your wallet can afford, but just remember, you don\u2019t have to tip every time and you don\u2019t have to tip a small fortune.

If you have children, we would highly recommend going elsewhere. First, upon check-in, we are informed there are 'resort fees'. I'm sorry, it was my understanding that hotels set their rates according to their amenities, conveniences and all that the hotel has to offer...why the need for a \"resort fee\"? Second, when we got to the first room, it hadn't even been cleaned and it was around 5pm. They were good about finding another room but it wasn't long and we found that the bathroom sink had a slow leak and was plugged. Needless to say, it over-flowed all over the bathroom. It took the maintenance guy over an hour to arrive. When he gets there, he uses a TOILET PLUNGER (what?!?) to \"fix\" it. He leaves and we have to call to have them send house cleaning as we surely didn't want to brush out teeth in a sink that was just plunged with something used in a nasty plugged up toilet at least a few times. We waited over an hour for them to arrive but the family was so hungry they couldn't hold on any longer so there is no telling what the sink was ever cleaned with, however we know they did show up because they replaced all the used towels we had mopped up the mess with. Dealt with the plugged sink for the remainder of the trip as we were already worn out from dealing with them. THIRD, the hotel / casino area is really dark and smokey. There is a definite nasty smell that seems to be a combination of smoke, lack of air flow, bad food, follwed by bad gas and who knows what else that has taken over this hotel. Fourth, the TOWER II, so called remodelled tower, is not remodeled. Unless you consider remodeling sticking in a few new pieces of furniture and fixtures and repairing cracked grout in the tile with grout that doesn't even match. The room smelled older than Las Vegas itself. The beds were far from comfortable, although we have slept on less comfortable hotel beds. Fifth, the hotel staff made no attempt to be prompt at any request and offered no break on prices. On a positive note, it is close to the stip for those looking for the convenience of that part, but for us, the lack of consideration and uncleanliness outweighed any of those conveniences. As far as being child friendly, NOT AT ALL. (There was a really nice lady who worked at the Pearl Factory on the first floor who was very entertaining and loved talking with our children answering their many questions about how those pearls got in the oysters! Kudos to her) All in all, we will not be returning to this hotel. If I could give it less than a 1 rating I would. The South Point Hotel/Casino at the south end of the strip will be getting our business from here on out.

The location is decent, very close to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay and only a short walk to reach some of the more expensive hotels. But at the same time, basic rooms are literally that - basic. I wanted the cheapest/most decent (if that's even possible) room, so I am not complaining about what it had/didn't have; the fact is there wasn't even a fridge in the room. The shower was poor and room service is nothing to brag about. They do not clean up anything unless you semi-clean it up first yourself. As for the time share selling people in the lobby...yes, there is about 1-2 of them at any given entrance. But honestly, they are not an issue unless you get annoyed easily. Simply don't even give them the time of day; I was approached once and just ignored his attempt to lure me in and I didn't get asked - but hey, maybe that's because I'm an intimidating college student! All in all, I'd recommend the hotel because the cheap prices you can get for the room. While luxury is preferred, sometimes it just isn't necessary. While I was in Vegas I spent barely any time in the room, and unless your whole family wants to watch TV on vacation, I don't expect many other people to spend a significant amount of time in the room.

Everybody was really helpful and willing to help us out in any way. We arrived at noon (and knowing that check-in isn't until 3pm) we decided that we were going to have the Bell Desk hold our luggage while we went and saw a show down the strip. However, we were greeted by employees at the Concierge Desk who told us that they were already checking people in, so we figured we would give it a try. We were upgraded for free to a Widescreen room, which was really nice. The Widescreen room has an iPod dock/alarm clock instead of the standard radio/alarm clock, a decent size widescreen falt-panel TV, iron, iron-board, hairdryer, the little alcove that hotels have with the shelf & hangers is enclosed with sliding doors (a first that I have seen), and a shower (no tub), and of course the dresser and table/chairs. There isn't a coffee pot in room, so coffee drinkers be forewarned. We didn't have much of a view, but only for staying 1 night (and in a town where you really aren't expected to be in your room anyways, but out on the casino floor) it wasn't that big of a deal. The casino had various games to play. It was not very hard to navigate and was very nice. Most of the restaurants/fast food is located on the second floor of the main building, which is nice that it is off the casino floor. The only thing that I didn't like was the constant barrage of time-share salesman (this is pretty much everywhere on the strip anyways). The Fantasy Faire/Arcade was fairly large and had a variety of games to play. They do have a 4D motion ride with 3 different scenarios: Extreme Log Ride, Dino Island & SpongeBob. It was $12.95 for all 3 for $9.95 for 1. Even if you aren't a fan of SpongeBob (like us), it is still worth getting all 3 to do the other 2 cheaper than buying them individually. The casino is located at the South end of the strip, and does require walking to get to the center. Other ways around are catching The Deuce (a local bus) or the monorail. Both do cost: $7/person for The Deuce (24-hours) & $14/person for the monorail (I think its 24-hours).

When our room was booked, the description of our room claimed it would have a safe, flat screen TV, 2 double beds and be non-smoking. When we checked in, our room did not have a safe, had an old tube TV and had a musty/smoky smell. We immediately went downstairs, explained our concerns and were moved to a new room. Our new room was exactly the same only it had a safe. Unfortunately, it also had a stained carpet and an air conditioner that was on the fritz (either blew high cold air or you had to turn it off, the low button didn't work). It was great having to wake up every 2 hours to turn the AC on and off because if we kept it running too long it would freeze, and kept it off to long it would be very hot. After explaining all of this we found out that there was another part of the hotel that had been renovated (these are the rooms with the flat screens, etc...). We told them that we were under the impression, because of the description we had read, that we should be in one of those rooms and they gave us a \"too bad, but you can pay $20+tax a night to upgrade.\" They then sent someone up to fix the AC, and when he got up there he said, and I quote, \"This is an old unit that can't be fixed. You just have to keep it on high or turn it off\". We told the hotel staff, and again were met with, \"that's too bad, but it'll cost you $20 a night to upgrade.\" We were treated with utter disrespect and had to pay extra for a functional, livable room that didnt smell terrible. We ended up paying for the upgrade because our room was that unbearable and we couldnt change hotels/cancel our reservation there. We are planning to go back to Vegas next March and I can promise you, no matter what the price, we will not be staying at the Excalibur nor do we recommend it to anyone! The newer, remodeled rooms are about average, nothing to complain about there, but the customer service and level of disrespect we were treated with is enough to keep me away.

After arguing with the manager, we were moved to a different room later that night, but still smelled like old smoke, but were told that it was a non-smoking room.

This was my first trip to Las Vegas so I decided to upgrade to a Widescreen Room with a View once I got there, for an extra $20 per night. I stayed in Tower 2 and I'm fairly certain that these rooms were the most recently updated. I went for a wedding and most of us got rooms in Tower 2, but one set of girls paid the very least that they could and got a room in Tower 1 that... honestly looked like a Motel 6 room... Like many others have said: You get what you pay for. My room ended up being the largest and had the best view of all the people that went for the wedding. Going in all I really wanted was clean bedding, a clean bathroom, no nail clippings on the carpet and a view of the Strip. I got all of that and I was quite comfortable during my stay. I do have a few minor complaints, but nothing that would have made me storm out or demand a refund. When I arrived, there were dirty room service dishes sitting outside my room that were not picked up until the next morning, but they didn't smell or anything and I couldn't see them except for coming back to my room. It was annoying, but I didn't trip over them, so really I wasn't terribly concerned. Also, I did go about 48 hours before housekeeping noticed that one of my lamps was missing a lamp-shade. Again, not a deal breaker, but a little more attention could have been paid. When I arrived there were face and handprints all over my window looking out to my terrific view--but all that took was a call to the housekeeping office the next morning. Truthfully, I was more concerned about looking at my view than the missing lampshade, which I actually could have done without, truth be told... And actually, for what I paid, I would have really liked a mini fridge in my room... Whenever I had a question or concern, I was met with smiles, understanding and friendly service/advice. Now--I would advise you to steer clear of the \"Blue Jacket Monsters\" as I've seen others call them. In any hotel, do not talk to anyone in a blue jacket with a name tag. Should you make eye contact, make sure you tell them you make less than $50,000 per year and they will want nothing more to do with you--even if you make much more. Unfortunately, all the hotel/casinos allow smoking on the gaming floors. There is no smoking upstairs around the shops and restaurants, however. There was a Baja Fresh just around the corner from the elevator that took me to my room. It was very good, but $17 for a burrito and two small tacos was a little pricey, in my opinion. I tried twice to go to the Sherwood Cafe--once for breakfast and once for lunch, but there was always a ridiculous long line and I have no patience for long lines when it concerns food. Upstairs though, is an Italian restaurant that catered to the wedding and the catered food was phenomenal! There was also a Starbucks, a 24-hour Krispy Kreme, a Pizza Hut Express, a 24-hour McDonald's, and a Quizno's Subs. The location is great! It is next door to The Luxor, which has Mandalay Bay on the other side. There is a free monorail that connects the three, although you can also use the walkways within all the hotels: I walked from Excalibur, through the Luxor and on to Mandalay Bay without once setting foot outside into the rain! The Monte Carlo and New York New York were across the street diagonal from Excalibur, but across from New York New York is MGM Grand. There is a walkway that connects Excalibur, New York New York and MGM. We also discovered that while Excalibur is on the very south side of the strip and the Bellagio is in the very center--it is only about a 15 minute walk from one to the other--but do NOT attempt that walk in heels, ladies! There is also a monorail that will take you from MGM Grand to any other hotel on that side of the strip all the way up to the north-most end. This one is not free, but you can get a 3 or 4 day pass for about $30 I think--or $5 each time you get on. It was nice though, so we walked everywhere. Overall, I loved the Excalibur and I would definitely stay there again! It is one of the cheapest places to stay and even if you do upgrade, it's still cheaper than staying at MGM Grand or Bellagio or somewhere, and there is so much to do all around that area.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cPrice-wise, it's the best for its location BUT...\u201d", "Author": "FamilyManLACA", "ReviewID": "UR58670512", "Content": "To whom it may concern: I want to comment on the hotel I recently stayed in. It is called Excalibur located on the Strip of Las Vegas. My entire experience was not a pleasant one. As soon as you walked in the front door or ANY door to Excalibur, there were dozens of salesmen waiting to lure you in a \"free offer\". First I thought they were the check-in counter greeters, so nice and everything, but I was so wrong. I am one of the stupid people who got \u201ctricked\u201d into this \"free-offer\". First, they asked if you want free tickets to shows, not giving all the details until after you paid $40 cash deposit. They kept telling you paid deposit here and you immediately can get it back at another counter somewhere in hotel. Not after they got your money do they tell you to attend a 3 hour long sales tour before getting the deposit back. And it is not immediate, it is the next day. Also, there were many survey questions they ask, some are very personal I think. I wanted to back out but they already got my money. The worst is yet to come, at the 3 hours (it really did take that long) tour, the salesmen there use many sales tactics to try to get you to buy a time share condo on that day. Who in their right mind would make a big purchase like this in one day? After telling them we are not interested 10 times, they tried and tried, with different salesmen and tactics. Finally, they know they can\u2019t make a sale with us do they let us get our money back, but before that, one more salesman trying his last attempt and plenty of survey questions waiting for you. I know the economy is bad, but the way they lure you into this is not a fair sales practice. They should let you know all the details first. If I knew the tour will take 3 hours of my vacation time and that I don\u2019t get my money right back like they said, I would totally refuse this stupid offer. It seems like Excalibur is the only hotel that have this hard sales at all their entrances. I went to many other hotels on the strip and they don\u2019t do this. Also, the stay at Excalibur is somewhat disappointed since they strip down to very basic \u201camenities.\u201d All they have is basic toiletries & basic TV channels. There is no coffee maker, no iron board, etc\u2026 I felt like I stayed at an overpriced motel. The \u201ccustomer service\u201d is terrible at this hotel.

Flamingo might have been slightly nicer, but really, how much time in Vegas do you spend in your hotel room? Not much for us. We would easily take the savings and stay here again. It has a free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay which is nice, and is still right on the strip to get to the other hotels. And it's super close to New York New York which we find to be a lot of fun to spend some time in. Excalibur itself was fun too, and the Knights dinner theatre was a blast. Highly recommended to check that out. The room was ok. You can tell it's older, and even though there's room for a bathtub we only had a stand in shower stall, but still, perfectly fine. It's obviously not the most romantic hotel room, but if you're looking for functionality, it's fine. The staff were very good.

Thursday afternoon we decided to take in Defending the Caveman to kill an afternoon. When purchasing tickets we were given the impression that there was reserved seating.......which there was not. The VIP ticket is only providing you with a pre-paid t-shirt!! Be prepared for the ulitmate in ridiculous, as we were charged $12.00 for two glasses of cola at the show. The Entertainer was good, but the false pretences provided by the ticket booth and the cost of the drinks left a sour taste in our mouth!! I have been in Vegas on several occasions....and this is definetly a tired property, staff included.

I traveled with a group of family of almost every age group for a 75th birthday celebration. We stayed at this hotel because it was known to be family friendly and it was. They had a nice pool area with a seperate pool for 18 and over. So having children jumping in and out did not offend those that wanted peace. However the pool closed at five, which i thought was odd because it was heated and people with children would have went at night. It had a big arcade which was nice for the children. There were so many families there no one felt out of places. We had a wide screen strip view room. the view was nice but the furniture was pretty beat up .I mean it looked like someone took shoots at it with a hammer.Room service never seemed to pick up the trays of food that people ordered from room service all week. It was absolutely disgusting. I tood the cleaning people everytime I saw them in the hall and they said dont worry they will take care of it. That never happened. I told the desk they said they would take care of it, Never happened. That was was there longer than me cause when i checked out it was still there. I know its not an expensive hotel and didnt expect the same services as a four seasons but thats rediculous. The people in the lobby stop you every time you walk past trying to sell you tickets to shows it never ends. Got directions from travel desk to go to grand canyon skywalk. ended up in California. When I read the small print at the bottom of the sheet It said not responsible for wrong directions so directions is a problem for them. I do have to say that all the staff were pleasant and friendly. The Buffet deal seemed great 29.00 All day. However lunch and are the exzact same. And it never veries from day to day.It did have a nice selection though. I dont gamble but i seen alot of people doing so and they appeared to having a nice time.It seemed to be a friendly crowd not a rowdy bunch. I guess because of the families that go. The location was the absolute best. That end of the strip was family friendly. There was no porn pushers like on the other end. The tram to the luxor and mandalay bay were great. All in all I had a nice time in vegas because its a fun place.

When we came after 18 hours of travel, they didn\u2019t have a room with king size bed. They offered us two queen size beds for one night and change the room in the next day.

We agreed (I knew from trip advisor reviews that these rooms are much better ones) and were very pleased from this decision. The room was huge and fully renovated (the biggest rooms are between the 1-7 floors we were on 5). It had a 2X2 meters king size bed, 43\" flat screen TV, big bathroom with a big shower stall (perfect for two or more\u2026) and a view to the swimming pool and the mountains with the snow on the top.

Upon arrival (a Monday evening), the queue at reception was relatively short. The sales people at the entrance try to get you to sign up for trips etc.... don't get sucked in, you will soon get used to saying \"no thank you\" as you are pestered with this kind of thing everywhere in Vegas. Anyway, so we were upgraded free to a widescreen room without asking, which was nice. The rooms here are great.... decent size, either 1 giant king size bed or 2 decent sized queens, walk in shower, plenty of storage space. Also our room had a table & chairs. The views weren't great, but that wasn't a problem. There is an ice machine & drinks machines on every floor. The lifts give you static shocks when you press he buttons! Ha ha. The pool area is fantastic.... several good sized pools which are always manned by life guards, free towels, pool side bar for drinks & snacks, a small shop for ice cream, sun tan lotion etc. You might not think of Vegas as a place to sunbathe, but the Excalibur certainly offers you somewhere to do that or cool off in the pool. I spent a couple of days out by the pool as I was there for 10 days so had plenty of time to do a bit of everything. Also sat out here for an hour in the morning before breakfast to read & let my hair dry! Shops on the main casino floor inside the hotel offer souvenirs, medication, snacks etc. There is also a restaurant, bar & a cake stall which is tasty. Upstairs you have McDonalds, Krispy Kreme, more souvenirs, toys, clothes, a wedding chapel.... all sorts really. This is where the moving walkway connects you to the Luxor. Downstairs there are fairground type activities & games for children, along with the Tournament Of Kings show (get tickets for this from Tix4Tonight) There is pay as you go internet access on the casino floor. 24 hours internet access in your room is about $17 if I remember correctly. The concierge desk isn't manned 24 hours a day, but the lady on there was very helpful & made phone calls, made suggestions etc for us. There is a taxi rank at the front of the hotel, where cabs are always available. The hotel is very large, so making the same long walk every day is a bit annoying, but that would be the same with any hotel, and the moving walkways make it slightly easier when your legs are tired! All in all the rooms were more than adequate, & given the small amount of time Vegas visitors spend in their room, I don't understand why anyone would spend more money to stay in a more expensive hotel when you can use the majority of the other hotels facilities anyway. It is at the end of the Strip, but still easy access to everything. It is particularly close to New York, Luxor & MGM Grand. However I wouldn't pay less to stay at the Stratosphere end of the trip. Even though the hotel is fine & is inexpensive, the money you save on your hotel you would end up spending on taxis to the main part of the Strip - it is quite a distance to the Strat. end; I walked it once & it nearly killed me! I would definitely stay here again & would recommend the Excalibur to anybody.... unless you're looking for luxury.... you won't find it here, you'll find a good priced, ideally located place to rest your head, and a fine place to stay all day if you want a hotel day.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "louisville", "Title": "\u201csuper bowl trip report\u201d", "Author": "wildcatfanLouisville", "ReviewID": "UR55660554", "Content": "stayed at excalibur sat thru tue super bowl weekend. this is about my 7th time to vegas and 1st staying at excalibur. also 1st time out here for super bowl. this trip was by far the best trip i have ever had. disregard any neg reviews. asked for upgrade to wide screen room at check in, lady charged me 10 dollars more a night to upgrade. told me at the end of our stay go to vip services and they will check my players card and take the fee off and they did.

I have now stayed at the Excalibur twice in the last few years, and I would stay there again for two reasons. It's cheap and it's in an excellent location. Hotel: If you're going for extravagance or ellegance this is not the place for you. If you're going to have a place to throw your stuff down, have a shower, and a little bit of sleep while partying in Vegas, then this place is for you. The rooms are much like Holiday Inn quality. The hotel itself is always crowded and a bit loud. The only other problem is that at this hotel you will see A LOT of children running around. I understand that not everyone can get a babysitter, but Vegas is not for children and I'll never understand why parents think it's ok to bring them with them to America's Adult Playground. The hotel is in an excellent location right in the middle of everything on the north part of the strip. Drinks: Drinks here are good as long as you're playing. Sometimes takes a while for them to get around but you'll get quite a few playing at a 5 dollar table. The drinks in the Sportsbook are even better, but you have to be betting a lot more for the constant service (100 dollars bet earns one drink coupon). Entertainment: They usually have a band playing at nights with some go-go type dancers dancing on top of tables and slot machines. Nice to look at, but terribly distracting while you're playing some blackjack which is exactly how they like it! Bottom line is this is a fine hotel for the money. Would I rather stay in a nicer room? Sure. Would I rather stay someplace with great service and no children? Absolutely.

Booked it as a slight up-grade from Circus Circus (which I am glad we did!), it lies about a 10- 15 minute taxi ride form the airport. The size of this place is `awesome`- some 4000 rooms. At reception we tried the old $20 `free room upgrade trick`. The staff member was slightly offended by this, refused the cash and gave us a slight upgrade anyway, although I would not like to have seen the un up-graded room! For USA, our room was quite big with a massive king size bed and large shower, 40\"-ish flat screen TV free safe etc.- more than adequate for our short stay. The room was quite clean but a bit jaded. Not that we were in the room much anyway. The massive casino area was a cacophony of noise - hundreds of mostly loud Americans shouting and screaming, different live music groups in different eating areas in the casino. And everyone seemed to be trying to outdo each other on the decibel stakes! Don't go expecting to win big style- we didn't see any big wins in our time there. The hotel is an a great location, at the junction of Las Vegas Boulevard (the strip) and Tropicana avenue- the best location in the place, I would say. The best way to get about is the local bus service, the deuce. $7 a day or $3 for a single trip, it covered the whole strip and more. DON`T get a Las Vegas sight seeing bus tour- $35 each fr a 2 day ticket that just covers the main strip area- a waste of money. Best shopping area in Vegas- The Outlet Centre, at the SOUTH end of Las Vegas Boulevard- get to it via the bus. Discount designer shopping in a massive mall. There is also a Premium outlet Centre at the north end of town- harder to get to and I would say 20% dearer fro the same brands. Best trip to do- visit the Grand Canyon/ Hoover dam- they are building a new road that avoids the Hoover dam so go soon or you wont get a chance to see it up close, due to Americas preoccupation about the terrorism threat. We went on a bus trip to see these awesome sights- a long day but well worth it. make sure you are well rested before you set off because you will be wrecked by the time you leave - and that's just from the shopping!

We could not have been happier with our choice! We paid for the upgrade to Tower 2, which for an extra $20 per night is definitely worth it. Room was very clean and quiet, and we had a beautiful view of the pool and the mountains which we thought was nicer than the strip view anyway. The tub could have used a little updating, but it was clean and did the job for us. Large granite countertop sink area that was large enough for all our toiletries. We stayed on floor 22 at the far end away from the elevators, which added a little walking but was very quiet due to the fact that we did not have people walking back and forth by our room at all hours of the day. Housekeeping was very efficient. The only compaint we had about the room was that there was no fridge and no coffee maker, but this seems to be standard these days in Vegas. We cannot understand people who complain about the resort fee. For $10 a day, you get internet, access to a beautiful new gym, as well as access to the pool and hot tub, which were clean. This is one of the only pools that was open in Vegas this time of year and for us Easterners 60 degrees in the sun feels pretty nice! Water in the pool was warm, and the hot tub was relaxing...we had bothpretty much to ourselves the whole time due to the facct that there are TWO pools and one of which is only for guests over the age of 18. Pool hours wereshort (10-5) but once it gets dark it would be too cold anyway. The $10 (for two people) we spent for this per day was one of the best values of the trip. Another common complaint on here is about the timeshare people. Yes, they will constantly try to stop you to give you their pitch (and they are EVERYWHERE not just in this hotel but every hotel on the strip!), but I found a very easy way to get them to quit on you immediately. As soon as they approach you tell them that you live in Las Vegas and they will stop in their tracks and leave you alone! This worked us the whole week and it is an easy, polite way to get them to back off. The location is the best on the strip in my opinion...and I have stayed in every part of it. there are moving walkways to get you to Luxor, Mandalay Bay and NY NY. The MGM is right across the street, as well as the Tropicana. Their is a lot of walking involved no matter where you stay if you want to save money on cabs, but we did not find this to be an issue as there is always so much to look at. The new City Center is a must see, and it is about a 10 minute walk from Excalibur. The casino was a little dated, but was fine for us. I won more money on slots than I did at any other hotel, and the table games were cheap ($5 minimums) and easy to get in on. I encounted one rude pit boss, but other than that the people were great and we were never waiting for drinks...in fact, most of the time my drink was only half empty and they were right there asking me if wanted another one! One last tip...if you can, get a late afternoon flight and ask for the late 3PM check out option. This will save you the hassle of a HUGE line to get a taxi in the morning! Also try to check in early as you will be waiting in a long line if you get there at 3 PM like everyone else. I tried the $20 trick here when I checked in to see if I could get an upgrade and it did not work.

Wow, it's nice outside! Then we go to Valet Park, but it's sadly full - with it's rude employees telling us to get out of here and self park in one of the spaces in their huge parking area which was packed with cars already. We had to park pretty far from one of the entrances and with the amount of luggage we had, and the cold air - this hotel was already getting a thumbs down for me. But you know - I decided to give the hotel a chance. So I'm entering the hotel and the automatic doors are broken. GREAT! Thank goodness some kind lady opened the door for me (not an employee) and I was able to walk to check-in. Check in line wasn't so long, so it look like 10 minutes and I proceeded to my room 5132. Floor 5, Tower One, Room 32. Once I entered, the whole trip was just ruined. UGLY UGLY UGLY standard tower room. This is the worst room I've ever stayed in the Las Vegas. I mean - this could stand back to back with Rivera's cheapest room and Sahara's standard room. But this was even way worse than the standard tower room at Circus Circus (a really great hotel, even if it is crowded with kids and a bit old). Anyways this room was a disaster. Chipped tiles in the bathroom. Mold on the bathtub. Handles of the sink I didn't even touch. Carpet was stained. Furniture was chipped. Chairs were stained. Beds were so old, you could feel the springs! Decor was so old, it was really dated and should be changed soon. THIS ISN'T ROYALTY THIS IS LIKE THE DUNGEON. I went to front desk and asked to change my room, but the staff was arguing that the hotel was fully booked (accidentally actually over-booked) and I was lucky to even get a room and that the people waiting in the lobby were waiting for any room they could get. SO, I went with it and slept on those mattresses and disgusting bed covers. The next morning, I went straight to Front Desk. I decided to take the $20 upgrade per night for the new \"Widescreen Rooms\". This is it room 24241, this is the last chance I'm giving Excalibur or I'm changing my hotel. I proceeded on to Tower 2, floor 24, room 41 - noticing that the hallways in this tower had new carpeting and more modern accents. I entered the room, and found it to be much much more better. Very modern, and cozy. THE UPGRADE IS WORTH IT! The only thing was the bathroom tiles were the same as the first room - but other than that everything was updated and different. The bed was also a great difference, with nice sheets and comfy mattress. THIS IS ROYALTY. So, everything from then was going fine - until the elevators. Only one damn elevator was working and it was just chaos. The line to get to the elevator was like 20 minutes. Unbelievable! This continued until our last day at the Excalibur. And that's all. It was a rough start, okay middle, and bumpy end - meaning I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Yes, the hotel's furnishings are OLD but the room was clean upon our arrival and was adequately cleaned upon our daily return. Check-in was fine but you have to walk through the casino to get there. I had no need to call the front desk for anything so I had no interaction with the staff. The bed was super soft and comfortable. There's neither frig nor microwave in the room. The TV only had about 6 channels and I personally didn't care for the fact that it had a shower (only) and not a tub. I also did not at all appreciate paying the resort fee (about $9 per night) upon check-in -- I don't even have a place to keep snacks so what am I paying for? DO NOT USE THE COMPUTERS IN THE BUSINESS CENTER. It charges you a minimum of 5.00 usage plus the cost of printing per page. I spent about $12 for literally 2 minutes of usage to print out 4 pages of boarding passes -- RIP OFF! (What was the resort fee for again?) They had a computer specifically for printing your boarding pass but of course it wasn't working. There's an entrance near the towers but otherwise, you have to walk through the casino to get ANYWHERE. Even though there is a smoke free section, it's not near either tower entrance so you're always walking through smoke just to get to your room unless you're up for always walking around the outside of the building. PARENTAL FYI: There are half-naked women dancing on stage at a club in plain view inside the casino after about 9 pm. I was in parent mode but actually Excalibur is a GREAT LOCATION FOR PARTY PEOPLE! For the price, the location and the comfort, it's very good. The buffet was a little pricey but the food and wait staff were great.

Oh, last PARENTAL FYI: VEGAS IS NOT FOR KIDS (unless you hole up at Circus Circus.)

See, when you drive in and park, the closest entrance is by the service entrance. You have to walk past their delightful dumpsters that have been in the Vegas sun all day. Beautiful. When I arrived at about 8pm Tuesday night, I was told by the less than friendly desk lady that the room I requested was unavailable. When I told her that's what I requested when I made my reservation, she said, \"We don't guarantee requests.\" Great. I inquired about upgrading (at my own expense) to Tower 2, and she still said that there were no rooms available. So what she's telling me is that in a 2,000 room hotel, on a Tuesday night in September, they don't have ONE smoking room? Right. Being that I was exhausted after our flight, I didn't have the strength to argue and so we ended up with two queens, non smoking in Tower 1. She did say, though, that if I called the following day I could get a new room. 18 floors up, down a looooooong hallway to a crappy room that I would expect from Motel 6. Now, I'm not stuck up and I often book Super 8's and Motel 6's when I travel, but in Las Vegas, I expected more. The bed was worn out and instead of a fitted sheet, the bottom sheet was just a top sheet tucked in. When you moved in bed, the sheet followed you. The room was bare bones for decoration and our view was of the interior of the castle. I hated this outdated disgusting room SO MUCH. The following day I paid an additional $20 per day to have the privelage to stay in the upgraded Tower 2. Talk about just masking the problem. The room was exactly the same as the first, except that the tv was a flatscreen, some newer drapes and carpeting had been added, the bed was actually a king and other cosmetic changes. The view was still of the interior of the castle, but this time we had the added benefit of a grease dumpster. In addition, there was a tiny table and two chairs tucked into this weird tiny alcove that's only accessible by squeezing between the wall and chair and ducking the ugly chandelier. What's the point of this table anyway? The t.v. gets 10 stations that aren't advertisements for Las Vegas. The hallways had room service carts outside of rooms for days. We watched the food got more dry and shriveled each time we walked past it. Every entrance to the hotel is overrun with people selling timeshares. My boyfriend figured out the best way to get them to leave us alone was to tell them we either lived in Vegas, or worked at the hotel. They quickly high-tailed it away each time. The whole hotel is outdated and gross. There are a ton of kids depsite the table dancing girls and hoards of drunks. (Why do people bring kids to Vegas???) The bartenders aren't that friendly, even when you tip them $5 on a $7 drink. I never once saw a watiress handing out free drinks. The pool closes at 6pm, and is only 3 1/2 feet deep. You get to feel like an idiot walking through the whole hotel to get the pool, too. I, too, received a questionare from the hotel when I returned home. They never responded.

This was our first time to Vegas. The hotel was decent for the money and we got a really good deal, especially for having been right on the strip. The rooms were clean and they cleaned our room and gave us fresh towels everyday. There wasn't anything spectacular or special about the room itself, but it's Vegas, we weren't in the room that much anyway. Our room wasn't on the strip side of the hotel, but that was fine. Take comfortable shoes because there is a lot of walking, which we did a couple of days. If you don't know the area, there are pedestrian bridges to get everywhere as well. You can walk right over to New York, New York and stroll around in there. One day we took the monorail, which is ok if you like walking to the back of the casinos to get to. If your not used to it, then it can be a long way. The nearest monorail station from the Excalibur is in the back of the MGM Grand and if you aren't used to that, it's a long way. The restaurants were nice. We tried the Sherwood Cafe, which wasn't bad, but a bit pricy. If you want a cheaper meal, I recommend going to the Village Court, which is on the second level and has McDonald's and other eateries. I got a breakfast burrito for only a $1. Can't beat that. One night we went to the Tournament of Kings show. It was cute and comes with dinner but because of the theme of the show you won't have untensils, but it was fun. I have heard negative reviews about this show, but it's not aimed towards your comedic shows or celebrity styled shows. I would highly recommend going to the Bellagio and seeing the fountain. It is beautiful and free and you can stay there as long as you like! There were not benches that we saw, so be ready to stand for a bit, but it's very well worth it! If you can make the trip up the eiffel tower which is just across the street that is worth it to see the fountain from there too, though we didn't make it there.

Striaght as we got in the door we were catch by some time share people who were offering us \"free ticket\" after 22 hours travelling we were fooled into going to a time share presentation which lasted 3 hours and is the biggest scam in the world.

As you can still smoke in bars and casinos in Vegas, you may find it hard to take if you are a none smoker and not used to smoke indoors. Excalibur was the most smokeist casino on the strip.

I couldnt believe how happy i was with the hotel , i was expecting maybe a few problems as the reviews i red wasnt great and the fact we got it so cheap, but wow i cannot explain what a deal your getting. PERFECT location. Nice chinese upstairs i'd recommend. Go in all the hotels, you have to visit them all, so beautiful and so much to see. New York had lovely bars and we ate in there most nights. We didnt eat at the hotel buffet as i didnt see what the point was, your there to experience all sorts of food and restaurants so in my opinion i wouldnt bother. Round the pool was great, loads of sun loungers, weather was lovely, not too hot. Go on the Rollarcoaster at New York New York Very fun!! We visited downtown to see the lightshow, apart from that there isnt much there, but was on the last night and since we were shattered from all the others nights we'd had out. Las Vegas has some fantastic clubs if you like your partying scene, of all ages aswell so dont be afraid, I'd recommend, The bank at the Belliago, PURE at Caesars Palace, LAX at the Luxor. DONT buy any tickets from people on the street, most of the time you can get them free from workers in the hotel. Also go the Paris hotel up the effiel tower, Me and my fiance went, was very romantic and you get a fantastic view of the Strip. We were there for Halloween and we had the BEST time ever! Very sad to be home. I would definitly stay at the excalibur again, why pay all that money for a top notch hotel if your hardly in it? EXCALIBUR ALL THE WAY!!!

Only now I find time reading other people's review and wanting to give my two cents. This was a hotel I can remember very vividly. It was Hell on Earth! -- We just got off the plane at 9am from a 14-hour flight from Hong Kong via Tokyo, heavily jet-lagged, tired and yes, they refused to give us a room even though they had one available. \"Hotel policies\" stated it is 3pm check-in time. Then she walked off as if refusing to discuss with us further -- Furnitures were old - chipped, scratched, written on - the table legs were crooked -- noisy outside of the room. The rooms were not very sound-proof -- noisy INSIDE of the room. The damn, old and cranky air conditioner, which was about to break down refused to shut up. And you really don't want to turn it off with the 44 degrees Celsius blistering Summer heat outside. Either you live with the noisy air-con or you live with the noisy corridors, either way, you are screwed! If it wasn't because of the discounted convention price that the organizers offered, we wouldn't have stayed there. Out of a total of 12 days we spent in Las Vegas, we had to stay for 5 nights in this hell hole. The other 7 night we booked at Luxor. We almost cancelled Luxor as well thinking the quality would be much the same because both Excalibur and Luxor were owned by the MGM group. Overall quality of service of this hotel is appalling, not because I was heavily ticked off of the other finer points but rather comparing with other hotels in other major cities around the world, this hotel is shameful to say the least.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay.

Once we were in our hotel room, I was very happy with it. We booked one of the newer widescreen rooms and asked for a view of the strip. We were told those rooms required an extra $10 a night, so that's what we did. Our room was on the left side of tower 2, and had an incredible view of NYNY and MGM Grand and some of the mountains. And while the TV is nice, there aren't many channels to watch (but who's going to be watching TV in Vegas, right?). The beds were really comfortable, with plenty of pillows, but we later discovered one drawback to having a strip-view room: the sound of traffic is so loud you feel as if you're sleeping right on the street! We fixed this by turning the A/C's fan on to drown the noise out, but those really sensitive to noise might want to avoid these rooms. The room was cleaned, bed made, bathroom supplies restocked each day and the towels were nice and fluffy. The hallways during our stay were kept clean and food carts & trays removed promptly. Our third day there, we discovered that the folder your room key comes in is also a map of the hotel if you unfold it even further, but we'd already figured out the layout by then. For the resort fee of $5, you get 2 free drink credits, 2 free passes to carnival games in the Fantasy Faire Midway and 2 free passes to the fitness center. We didn't use the fitness center or pool area, so can't comment on them. We were approached by the timeshare people and were at first fooled into thinking they were hotel employees trying to help us. As I'd read previous reviews, I quickly figured it out. If you just keep walking, they leave you alone. They are dressed in navy blue suits and are located right next to the tower entrances and the bell desk. We tried the breakfast buffet and was happy with it, but I'm sure there's better elsewhere on the strip. As for location on the strip, I was somewhat happy with this hotel. It is a bit of a hike to the really impressive mid-strip hotels, but a major part of the fun I had in Vegas was exploring the strip. Also, the Deuce bus makes it easy and cheap to get around. We aren't gamblers at all, so while I'd say the casino was dark and smoky, it didn't seem to be that much more so than any other casino we walked through. All in all, we were both very happy with our stay here and felt (at least with the Widescreen view room) it was probably worth more than what we'd paid for and I definitely recommend staying here if you want somewhere nice while sticking to a budget. I'd probably choose somewhere else to stay if we ever visit Vegas again, but that's only for the sake of variety.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSome good, some bad\u201d", "Author": "CamaroNC94", "ReviewID": "UR47833163", "Content": "Third trip to Vegas in about a year and a half. Have stayed at Ballys, Harrahs and Imperial Palace(twice). Decided to go with Excalibur because I waited too long to book and they had a better deal than any of the HET properties at the time. This trip I decided that I wanted to stay on a weekend night. Flew in on Sat around 3:30 and stayed two nights at Excalibur before moving to my comped nights at Imperial Palace. First thing my opinion about Vegas on a Sat night...basically the same as a weekday night only more people! Got to hotel around 4:30pm, no line for check-in. Front desk lady tried to make me upgrade to widescreen room for $20 extra each night, no thanks paying enough already. Told her that I would like my standard room on a higher floor. She told me that she couldn't give me one if I still wanted a smoking room. Told me it had to be 1st or 2nd floor only in the standard room but if I paid for upgrade I could have one of those rooms higher up. Hmmmm, No thank you again, told I would take 2nd floor...she said we only have 1st floor left. Great! No map of hotel given. Really wished they would have given a map to know what all was in the hotel. Nothing in the room either. Room was in Tower 1, first floor. Didn't need elevator so can't comment on it. Room was next to last room on hall. Had to go all the way to other side of Tower 1 for ice machine. (had to ask directions from security, no map remember?!) Security was usually sitting there by elevator, sign says you need to present room key but no one ever asked. Sales people are completely outta control, they harrass you as soon as you walk in the door for all angles and are always by the entrance to rooms so they get you coming and going! Don't be fooled at first they will make you think they are hotel staff trying to help you check in!! Okay, now to my lovely standard room on the first floor. At first I was completely upset but as it turned out being on the first floor was great!! No waiting for elevators!! Room was quiet, no outside noise, as the view was of a giant wall. There was some space in between and a maintance guy walked by the window one day and scared the crap out of us. Had two double beds, comfortable but only 2 pillows on each. Thank goodness we only used one bed. Got in bed the first night and pulled the covers up to find holes and brown stains....ughhh! Quickly got out and switched beds, that one was better. Room service was good but they did stop me in the hall one day at 11:30 and ask if we were leaving the room at all. Ummm yeah give me a minute lady, I'm on vacation! lol Room had small table and two chairs. Typical small no channel vegas tv. Bathroom was rather large, no tub just shower. Room size for standard room was pretty good size. Went to the pool for about an hour one day. Not packed since it was Oct but nice set up. Pool is located in Tower 2. Didn't do too much gambling here, usually keep on walking out to other hotels. Liked having a base to return to after exploring south end of strip more thorougly. You can walk into Luxor and then into Mandalay Bay without going outside. They also have a free tram connecting them. Liked walking to NYNY, MGM and Tropicana. Bought a 3 day Deuce pass online a head of time and used that to head to the other end of strip and downtown. This hotel has an excellant food court. Loved being able to walk to second floor for quick food options. Ate at McDonalds and Chinese place but they had lots of other stuff to choose from.

We were heading back to Vegas Oct 12-22, myself, wife, 12yr old son and my folks. We had stayed at the Excalibur same time last year, and this was to be our 5th visit to Vegas in the last 7 years. Got a great deal on Smartervegas.com, $647 for widescreen room for 10 nights. After a long day travelling from Scotland, we hit Vegas at about 2130, grabbed our bags and dived into a taxi. $15 and 10 minutes later, we were at the check in desk!! No lines, served straight away. Tried the $20 trick but check in clerk already rushed through our booking before even asking for ID & CC, so he didn't even get the chance to see the sandwich, lol.... Only upgrade available was view room for extra $15 per night, declined his offer as we knew the rooms booked were good enough. We were on 26th floor, with view of Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Ok, to the rooms....Like i said, we had stayed here the previous year, so knew what to expect. My folks however were at the Ex for the first time, having previously stayed at the Hilton and HGV Club. Everyone was impressed with the rooms, large enough, 2 good sized queen beds in each room, with requested adjoining door. The Excalibur, in my opinion is a great hotel if the price is right, and we certainly got a great deal. We didn't use any of the hotel restaurants, as we had other places we wanted to try, although we did hit Krispy Kreme Doughnuts a few times!!! Service at the hotel was very good from all employees, and this was true when my folks shower had backed up and a maintenance man turned up within 5 minutes of reporting to front desk!! Pool area was good as always, and had 3 out of 4 pools open, and cabana hire for $60 was really good. Tables and slots were pretty tight though, but i felt this was the case at all the casinos this year, not just the Excalibur. Overall, had another great stay at good prices and comfortable rooms.

Obviously below the Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian etc or the MGM & Mirage, on a par with Harrahs and Flamingo, slightly better than Circus, Stratosphere, Tropicana! This hotel has a supposed King Arthur Camelot castle theme with knights in shining armour, fair maidens, fire breathing dragons and......Robin Hood???? Having said that I found the check in staff miserable and was pounced on every five minutes by the ticket sellers once i ventured off the casino floor! They seem more evident and annoying here than anywhere else I've stayed on the strip. They are like the roaches that hand out flyers outside Planet Hollywood, just in suits! The casino is typical of any other hotel and not much to write home about. The room, located in one of the lower floors of tower 1 had no view at all but was spacious and adequate with plenty of storage space, table & chairs, shower but a safe that didn't work. This was the first time in three trips here over the past 12 months that I was stung for the $5 a night resort / energy tax! The hotel, clean for the most part but I did notice plates & dishes in our halway which noone collected for over 24 hours! Oh yeah and the moat didn't seem to have water in it for our entire stay....guess the water shortage has finally reached Vegas! There are plenty of food choices from fast food to restaurant but fails to have that exclusive eatery or the big name chef attatched to the 4 or 5 star hotels on the strip. A poor selection of shops here, a couple of souveiner ones and plenty selling kids bits & pieces, nothing suitable for a thirtysomething couple! In my opinion if you want to stay this end of the strip opt for the New York, New York or Luxor or pay that little bit extra for the MGM Grand.

On arrival, we asked for an upgrade and got one of the refurbed rooms with the plasma tv and a view of the strip which was brilliant all for nothing (well, a bit of sweet talking and smiles), so that was the best start we could have hoped for !! Room was in tower 2, second floor and was perfect for what you we needed. At the end of the day it is a base and somewhere to sleep and shower. Never see the point of spending a fortune on a luxury room when you wil hardly be in it! So, the view from the room was of the strip, as we looked out the window we faced the side of monte carlo and if we looked slightly right we had the view of the strip, mgm, new york new york etc etc and could see as far down as the venetian. The room had recently been refurbed and looked good and modern, nice plasma, carpets, comfy beds and large bathroom etc. No faults with the room at all. The pool area was nice, no where near the size and quality of mgm's pool area but still nice and always found sunbeds early afternoon. Inside the casiono areas, it does have an old look about the place and probably could do with modernising but the likes of excalibur, new york new york and other older hotels are sometimes what vegas is all about. We walked past the 'party pit' every night back to the room which was a nice view, the casino, slots and tables were always busy, as well as the food areas etc. Overall, we were pleasently surprised by the quality of the hotel, especially the room we had.

Here is my take on Excalibur to help you with your decison: The room- Sheets and pillowcases had stains on them. Gross. There were used glasses outside our door when we first arrived and for about 24 hours after. Gross. Dust on bedside table. Gross. There is no fridge in the room and it is 20$ a day to rent one. I asked for extra blankets and the person at the front desk said \"We'll see what we can do. I'll put it in the computer.\" Like that was so much to ask! He was VERY rude to me. I have been to many hotels and have traveled to many cities and I've never been spoken to like that by someone at Guest Services. I simply asked for two extra blankets. I asked for these blankets because they are paper thin and there are no comforters on the beds, just very thin blankets. The pillows are VERY soft. There is a plasma tv in the room with about 5 channels, so what's the point? The bathroom looked slightly updated but still in need of repairs. The beds are very firm. I like firm beds so this didn't bother me as much as the soft pillows, the dirty sheets, and the paper thin blankets. Service- Besides the man at the front desk, every one was very nice. The bell man, the waitresses and waiters, bartenders, etc. Location- good. There are many shops near by and places to eat. Excalibur has a nice buffet where you can eat all day for $29. We also really liked the italian restaurant \"Regale.\" There is also a chinese take out place, Coldstone, Starbucks, Auntie Anns, McDonalds and other options. I really liked Excalibur's eating options. Excalibur is about a 10$ cab ride from the airport. It is within walking distance to all the big hotels like Bellagio, Ceasers, Venetian, Mirage, Mandalay Bay, MGM, New York. Mirageand Venetian are about a mile away. There are several pools and they are all nice. You can rent a cabana to get out of the heat for $80. The cabanas have plasma tvs in them as well. The spa- wonderful. So relaxing and clean. There is a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, showers, etc. I got my first massage and it was perfect. Ask for Tricia, she was awesome! Prices are reasonable. Tip: take the bus for $7 all day and see Old Las Vegas and all the wedding chapels and get on and off as much as you like. Go see Love by Cirque Du Soliel.

We were offered rooms at the Sahara @ $16 per night, but staying at the Excalibur was the best thing we ever did. The room was clean and offered a good view of the southern strip. We stayed on the 11th floor of Tower II. I think the only disappointment was the distance you had to walk to get to the casino from your car. This wasn't my first trip to Vegas, but it was for my two friends and we wanted to take full advantage of the weeks stay. The casino offered free games of chance ($5x2) and two free drinks ($5x2) every day we stayed at the hotel. This was to offset a $5.60 fee we were billed daily in addition to our $38 plus tax nightly room charges. The weeks stay was only $187.38, we received 2 free nights because we stayed the entire week. Considering that many of the other casinos were charging close to or over $100 per night, I think we made a great decision. The casino was packed daily, but got worse on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. There were plenty of comps being thrown around, but not for a group of guys, only for couples. So show/dinner/casino discounts were not offered to us in the casino. The TIX discount show booth is only 1/2 block from the Excalibur, so we didn't miss out getting discounts on shows we wanted to see. There is a 2 for 1 discount for those who stay at the Excalibur to the \"Tournament of Kings\" dinner show, so don't book this at checking if you are staying a few days. They don't offer the discount until you have stayed a few nights, but go down to the desk everyday! They will offer you comps you didn't receive at check in. The all you can eat \"All Day\" buffet is a great option for $25, but we didn't take them up on it since we were not willing to come back to the casino for lunch and dinner. They place a daily guide in your room of events that occur in the casino all week, plus there are other specials slipped under the door every morning. I will stay again, especially since we were only in our room to freshen up or sleep. By the end of the week we heard people being offered $189 per night @ the Luxor, but looking at the rooms, we were very happy with our decision to stay at the Excalibur for less than a nights stay at a neighboring casino.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "acepeda", "ReviewID": "UR45853776", "Content": "Location is perfect for Las Vegas... at a great price!!

We stayed in a widescreen tower view room which was one of the newer rooms in the hotel. Our room was HUGE, really clean, nice bathroom, big plasma TV and great views of new york new york hotel and MGM grand part of the strip. For the price this is a great hotel in terms of quality and location. The casino was also really good and we really liked the Italian restaurant in the hotel. You also get two free drinks vouchers on checking in. Pools were good too although the main one was closed for duration of our stay and none of the staff seemed to know why. A bit annoying when we paid $5 day resort fee! The other two pools were good though. We did a free poker lesson in the casino one moring which was really good and the 1c slots at Excalibur were the best we played on in terms of fun and frequency of wins!! The casino seemed a bit more smokey than other hotels maybe because of the low ceilings - As non smokers this was a bit of a pain. Drink severs came round frequently and were more than happy with a one dollar tip per free drink. Overall I would definatley recommend the Excalibur and would stay there again in future. It seems a lot of the negative reviews on here are from people who stayed in the older rooms so maybe its best to book the newer widescreen tower rooms like ours when staying here if you can. As with most of the hotels you have to put up with the staff trying to get you to go on timeshare tours. We actually went on one of these tours to get free theatre tickets. This might not be for everyone but we were pleased we gave up 3 hours one morning to get 2 full price Cirque du sol theatre tickets for free! Also got breakfast whilst there too!

We stayed in tower 1 like tower 2 a good distance away from the check-in desk but it really didnt matter to us. When we got up to our room everything was clean including the bathroom. They had a good amount of towels for everyone as well as extra toilet paper. Also what i really liked was since there were 5 of us we were given rooms right next to each other and we could access each others room because there was a door within the room. I am picky when it comes to the beds...but my bed was clean and soft...my only complaint was that the pillows weren't the best. Also just to set the record straight, there are no refridgerators or microwaves....so we ended up buying a styrofoam coolers to keep water, juice, and LIQ cool. Also, there is a tram that will take you from the excalibur into the Luxor and Mandalay bay hotels, which can be accessed within the hotel.

Yes, it is an older hotel, but it was clean, our room attendant was awesome and went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. Being also, that when in Vegas, not much time is spent in the room. It was extremely hot during the week and the air conditioner worked perfectly. Our view was ok enough to get some good pictures from the room. Check in was unbelievably fast, and the line up was loooong! Pleasant staff as well. I have nothing negative to say about the hotel other than the elevators could use a bit of better air flow, but a very quick ride I must say, the elevators are also split into sections of the hotel so ours was from the 18th to (I think it was) 27th floors. The service in the casino was great, have to remember how many people are all thirsty all at the same time, if you are THAT thirsty there are other options for beverages and convenient. We went to Thunder from Down Under, now this girls will be up to you, but I would have preferred to spend my money on something else! The men were handsome yes and can dance, and 99% of the time fully clothed. We were lucky to see some \"butt cheek\" and there was no frontal nudity. There was alot of talk from the host and alot of advertising. Another thing is that the hostess does not check ticket stubs matched with the seats. We had a lady be quite rude and told us to move not realizing there were numbered seats, only to see that lady get the boot from those seats. The highlight was that my friend got pulled up on stage, never saw her smile that big!!! Jello shots helped ease the feeling of wasting my money. We also went to see The Tournament of kings...totally worth it!!! Great show, well done and beautiful costumes. Check out was a breeze as well.

Over the past 5 years my husband and I have visited Las Vegas 3 times,staying at the Imperial Palace, Flamingo and Luxor and have found the accomodation to be pleasant and more than adequate for our needs. When we checked in to the Excalibur after 14 hours of travelling, the member of staff was very pleasant, and upgraded with out asking us to a widescreen tower room which had recently been refurbished, and gave us some vouchers for 2 free drinks, 2 free spa passes and 2 free games on the fantasy midway. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated, and was more than adequate for our needs. As we explored the hotel we were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, and the helpfulness of the staff who we encountered. The pool was fantastic, and there was always sunbeds available for guests, even over the labour day weekend which saw a massive increase in the number of guests staying at the hotel. The only drawback was that it was a real suntrap, and the pool had very little shade (unless you hired a cabana for $60 - $100 per day) but the shallow pool and hot tub helped to cool you down. The only negative thing about the hotel was the constant badgering by sales staff to get you to attend a presentation for the new city centre resort - they were placed in all key areas in the hotel, and even though they were not persistant, we found ourselves finding alternative routes through the casino to avoid them. Overall I was really suprised at the quality of the accomodation and would definately stay here again. The rates are cheap, there are plenty of options for food, drink and shopping, and is in a prime location for accessing many of the large hotels. The other advantage of staying at the Excalibur is that it is one of the first stops on the deuce route and so normally has loads of room before hitting the really busy bus stops.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201chard hotel to rate\u201d", "Author": "chrissymidnight", "ReviewID": "UR42505565", "Content": "Everyting in this hotel is either really good or really poor no middle ground Stayed for 2 weeks from 29 aug Check in was a night mare flew with thomas cook (who are a joke very strict on luggage weight charged nearly \u00a3100) who get you to your hotel at mid day but you cant check in until 3.00 p.m. . unless you pay for a room upgrade so its a bit of a con because the last thing u want to do is wait in recepion for 3 hrs after a 10 hour flight, youl pay anthing to get a room So we upgraded to tower 2 room was very nice memory foam bed pillows good air con, but no bath? for a view of the strip ask for tower 2 high floor with an odd low numbered room.

Traveled from the airport and back via city bus, using our 24 hour passes we purchased for $7pp knowing we'd be using them alot for the Deuce the next day. It was very very easy! Spent the first night gambling at the Excalibur casino. Cocktail service was once about every 20 minutes.. not bad. Didn't win but was able to gamble on their penny keno machines for about 4 hours on only $20. Woke up the next day ready to hit up their all you can eat buffet for $25. I'll tell you right now.. the reviews are true! It sucks!!! DON'T DO IT!!! Go next door to the Luxor and do their all you can eat buffet for the few extra dollars; or even at the MGM which I believe just started theirs. ANYTHING has got to be better than the Excalibur buffet. I read reviews of it before going and I took it all with a grain of salt, as we wanted to do a cheap Vegas trip and not worry about the cost of spending money on food for one day while there. Yeah.. won't be doing that again. Anyway.. about the room.. no amenities in the room. There was a hair dryer, a magnifying mirror in the bathroom, fabulous towels, COLD a/c, and comfy mattress and bedding. Elevators were quick, even on the day of check out at 1059am (check out is at 11am, by the way). Walking to the neighbor hotels were no problem at all. There's an indoor walkway to the Luxor, which links (indoor!) to Mandalay Bay. Going to NYNY, MGM, and Tropicana you do need to walk outdoors. There is no street crossing to these hotels as they have bridge walkways that take you over the streets. Elevators and escalators (when working) are provided for ease as no one wants to walk outside when it's 100+ degrees outside. It was a great budget trip overall. I will stay there again, but will not eat there. There's too many other food places to try out in Vegas to settle for blah! Oh.. one other note.. there's these people between the entrance and the check-in desk, and again located near the walkway to the hotel rooms that ask you if you want free show tickets.

Some of the furniture (plural) were broken. The beds were relics left over from the mid 70's - you could feel the springs in both of the beds. I'm pretty sure there was black mold in the bathroom - which can be a health concern (and is pretty amazing since Vegas is the driest place you can find). The hotel & Casino is a smoking establishment (like all the hotels on the strip), but because of its age, it has a \"special funk\" about it. The positives were that it was closely located to the MGM, the Luxor, and New York New York. It had a pretty decent arcade for kids. There's a family friendly show with knights, horses, jousting, while eating with your fingers. There's a food fair on the 2nd level that has a McDonald's, Quiznos, and a few other places. There are 3 or 4 pools (some with water slides), and a bunch of deck reclining chairs - perfect to soak up the Vegas sun. Overall, though, I'd say you could do better.

I know it's vegas, but really, this doesn't belong along the main walk between registration/front door and the rooms in Tower II. - Arcade downstairs feature many broken games, taped over coin slots, working whack-a-mole missing a mole while the broken one next to it had the full set... - If you visit the arcade in the afternoon, don't expect any of the change machines to work. One of the attendants I asked about the machines said the morning crowd empties the machines so that's why they were all empty. And the same person didn't have any change. A nice guest changed one of my $1 bills for 4 quarters. I'm dismayed that they can't schedule a few more refills on the machines. - My wife was nearly knocked down by two bellmen taking luggage to the rooms. Going from the Tower II elevators into the rest of the property, there's an incline ramp. The bellmen take FULL baggage carts down this, barely under control, disregarding guests that are milling around. The 2nd guy was clearly out of control and no sign of apology from him after he side-swiped my wife with the cart. Thankfully no injuries. - Sleeping guards at the elevator rooms. There's a sign as you go into the elevator area that you should show your room key to the guard. Yeah, right. Not sure what purpose these guys served. They definitely were not preventing anyone from going up the elevators. Guess they were just waiting for people to come in and announce that they were up to no good to stop them. And yes, one morning, I'm pretty sure one of the guards was sleeping. - No coffee maker in the rooms. Heard a number of guests complaining about this. - Inconsistent housekeeping - seemed the linens in the bathroom kept decreasing in qty during our stay and they did not do a good job cleaning the room, inconsistently wiping down surfaces. - Reservation system that didn't confirm our online booked reservation.

Upon going to our room we found that the door would not open. We reported the situation to a security guard who went back to our room with us. After trying the door several times he discovered that the doorset was faulty and that you had to jerk the handle in order to get it to open. We then discovered that the door would not close unless you slammed it several times. He said that we should probably report the problem to someone. The next morning I did report the problem to one of the housekeepers on our floor and she stated that she had noticed it wasn\u2019t working the day before when she cleaned the room. She did call and report the problem. I also went to the front desk and reported the problem. The door was repaired by the time we returned from breakfast. We also received a follow-up call from housekeeping asking if the door had been repaired and if it was working properly. The room was good sized but older and rather tired looking. The wallpaper by the window was peeling back, the curtain was missing some of the rings and hanging down. The furnishings showed signs of wear, one of the bed spreads had a hole in it and one of the chairs had a mark where someone had tried to repair the hole in it with tape, but the tape had peeled off long ago. A shower cap from a previous guest was left hanging on the bathroom door for two days. I told the housekeeper about it while she was cleaning our room and it was gone when we returned to our room. We were awakened at 5:30 in the morning to the sound of the fire alarm (but this could happen in any hotel). It turned out to be false alarm. The elevators were efficient with very little wait time. There were time share salesmen in the common areas (as they were in several other hotels) but they were polite, offered assistance and really didn\u2019t bother anyone. The buffet at the hotel was very reasonable and the selection varied. This is a typical buffet with all the usual selection of foods along with Mexican, Italian, and Chinese food bars and a carving station. The lines can be rather long but they move quickly. Again the staff was friendly and efficient. We also went to the Tournament of Kings dinner show. It was different and fun, but one of those things were going once is enough. You eat everything with your hands as there are no eating utensils. Eating broccoli with your hands is very different. I would think that families with younger children will really enjoy this show. The show itself is not great acting, but fun. You cheer for your King as he competes in a various contests.

The cost to upgrade was well worth it, mainly for the proximity to the pool, and for the view of the pool and mountains. Actually, the first rooms they put us in on floor 17 overlooked the roof and a/c units. A call to the front desk landed us rooms on the other side of the hall with spectacular views for no additional cost. The rooms were clean and well-appointed. The beds were comfortable, and the a/c worked great for both rooms. There were no problems with construction noise or other guest noise. The employees, for the most part, were great. On the last two days we were there, the winds in Las Vegas were strong and Excalibur closed all three pools!! This was very disappointing and the front desk was lackadaisical about it, saying it was for guest safety and no compensation would be offered. We went over to the Monte Carlo pools and spent the day there. It was windy, but I didn't see that anyone's life was in danger at the Monte Carlo. We had massages at the Excalibur spa and weren't real impressed with the $60 25-minute back massages -- actually, that was the most disappointing thing about the whole trip. The best things about the trip were the great rooms with views and the uncrowded pools. The other resort pools were jampacked. One day we went to check out the Mandalay Bay pools because they are supposed to be the best. At first, the pool guy at the turnstile said \"No entry without a hotel key,\" but when my husband gave him a $20, he unabashedly said we were \"abolutely welcome in.\" It was a nice pool, complete with sand, wave pool, and lazy river, but you have to buy tubes for $23 each!!! Luckily, we met some people who loaned us theirs. The Monte Carlo, whom we didn't have to bribe for entry, charged a reasonable $10 per tube!

Personally, i dont think the hotel should allow time share people to bother their guests. We didn't eat in the hotel but would recommend the outback steak house above the coca cola shop.

If you read my profile and contributions, you will note that I am almost always satisfied with the hotels I choose. That is because I research them thoroughly and select the ones most likely to provide the experience we are looking for. The reviewer who had to move from the Excalibur to Caesar's Palace was obviously in the wrong place the first time! The two hotels are nothing alike, and for my family, that is a good thing. The Excalibur is a great place for kids. The turrets, drawbridge, and moats may be a bit cheesy, but my grandsons loved them. The Tournament of Kings dinner show was a big hit. No, it is not historically accurate, but we weren't there for a history lesson. Our grandsons did learn about jousting and the legend of King Arthur, and the beautiful horses were an attraction themselves. The dinner was good: tomato soup, a small roasted chicken, broccoli, french fries, rolls, apple turnovers, and pitchers of soda. If you book your stay on the hotel's web site, choose the promotion that includes 2 for 1 tickets to the show. Our boys absolutely loved the 4-D rides and the arcade. Look in free tourist magazines for discount coupons. We stayed on a lower floor on the side facing New York New York, and we never once heard the jackhammer or construction noise another reviewer complained about. We did hear screams from the roller coaster at NYNY, but we considered that part of the Vegas atmosphere, as we didn't go there for peace and quiet. Our room was a double queen with the widescreen TV. It was quite large and was serviced regularly while we were out during the day. The sheets were of high quality, and the towels were new. Bathroom amenities were excellent and were replenished each day. I will agree with another reviewer that the sink counter was unusually high and that the toilet paper holder was not within a child's easy reach.. Also, the room did seem a little dark, but after all, you are staying in a castle!. TV channels were limited, but we had almost no time for TV anyhow. The halls, elevators, and public areas were clean enough, maybe not to the standards of Caesar's Palace, but certainly adequate for a place with so many children and so much foot traffic. We appreciated the fact that there was a McDonalds on site, in addition to a Pizza Hut Express, Quiznos, Krispy-Kreme, and Cold Stone Creamery. Our grandsons would have little interest in the food offerings at Caesar's Palace, and I wouldn't like the price. We were tempted to buy the all-you-can-eat -all-day buffet tickets, but we didn't think our young grandsons would eat $25 worth each day, although that might be a bargain for some people. Shopping venues included souvenir shops and Everything's $10 stores. Again, if your taste runs to Armani and Gucci, for heaven's sake, don't book the Excalibur! The location at the south end of the Strip suited us perfectly. We wanted to see Bodies: The Exhibition at the Luxor, in addition to seeing the Luxor itself, which was right next door. We walked the length of the Strip, visiting every hotel along the way, seeing the light show and conservatory at the Bellagio, Cleopatra's barge at Caesar's Palace, and the volcano at the Mirage. Although we bought a monorail ticket for one day, we found it to be not very helpful. Getting to and from the monorail from the Strip was more trouble than just walking along the Strip, and the Strip was much more interesting. We considered the Deuce bus, but every bus we saw was horribly overcrowded. We just walked, which was best for us anyhow. Yes, there were obscene pictures of boobs scattered on the sidewalk and men (and one very pregnant woman) passing out invitations to Dial-a-Girl, but to me, that is no worse than the advertisements for erectile dysfunction prescriptions that now punctuate primetime TV shows.At least you can reject the offers of the touts; the Viagra ads come into your living room when you are only trying to watch the news. Certainly, the mystique of Sin City is disappearing in our more open and permissive society.The Excalibur itself had heavy security at every exterior entrance and at the entrances to the towers where the rooms were located. There was absolutely no semblance of impropriety there, at least not before midnight when we retired. Dick's Last Resort Restaurant wasn't even doing a good job of looking risque. From the outside it just seemed silly and juvenile, not obscene. Along with our stay at the Excalibur, we flew to the Grand Canyon National Park for one day and spent another at Hoover Dam. We did not swim in the pool, which seemed awfully crowded, as did all the pools we saw, especially the one at Mandalay Bay.

Directly below our window there was major constuction work going being done on the road. The noise from this was 24hrs and due to the window having no sound proofing we were kept awake all night by jack hammers and pnuematic drills.

We returned to the concierge desk in the morning to get our room switch and all the could give us was a downgraded room with no view and she said she new nothing about the partial refund, as the guy on the night desk had made no note of it. On top of this the public areas of the hotel were very dirty, especially the lifts and corridors. There was quite often trays of uncollected room service stuff left outside rooms for days. The pool area was nice yet the part with the water slide was closed off because there weren't enough life guards. The all day buffet was good value but my wife visited the rest rooms twice and on both occasions there was someone vomiting in there. I know its Vegas but if you've been drinking all night why would you go for a buffet? We checked out of the Excalibur and moved to Ceasars which was excellent in every way, the check in clerk even upgraded us for free when we ntold him about our experience down the street.

We were skeptical at first given some of the reviews and the ratings. We have fairly high standards from previous trips to Mexico, Jamacia and Hawaii. We would say that for the value this was a very nice hotel and casino. There were much fancier and glitzier hotel/casinos like Caesars, Planet Hollywood and Bellagio (to name a few) but for the price this was very nice. Rooms: Upon check-in we had originally booked a standard King size room in Tower I. We asked for an upgrade to Tower II in a widescreen room and were given it for free. (Never hurts to ask). The room was very nice on the 25th floor and had a nice view of the pools. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. It was nothing fancy or over the top, but you spend very little time in the room anyways. Casino: The casino was great because even on the weekend and later at night, you could find $5 tables without a problem. Also the dealers were very friendly at the Craps table as they taught me how to play and it paid off. The casino never seemed very busy. The drinks were expensive unless you were gambling, then they were free. We did not have any problems with Timeshare pressure as when we told them no, they left us alone. Food: We did not eat at any restraunts here, but it was nice having a Starbucks for my wife and Monster enery drinks for me. On one side note, we ate at Casa Di Amore and it was fantastic!! We also had the seafood buffet at the Rio and it was great as well. Pools: The pools were somewhat busy, but because there were so many, you could find chairs without a problem. Overall, we would definitely stay here for the money as the location is fantastic and the hotel/casino is of great value!

More importantly, the pools weren't crowded and so you enough room to float around on rafts, play catch, etc. We rented a cabana for one of the days, which was nice albeit a bit expensive at $100. The only problems with the pool area were one of the slides being closed and because many guests leave their towels on the chairs when they leave, it can be hard to find a group of lounge chairs that you know for sure are unoccupied. Pool side drink service was also good. All that said, the place is a budget hotel.

This would have been a PERFECT place to get married, although it would have been just the two of us. In hindsight, it would have been ok. Instead we are doing the same thing here and we also have Medevil times here in Toronto. The hotel is beautiful, located near the end of the strip across from the MGM Grand and Tropicana and right smack beside New York New York. We rented a car for $155 for the whole week. Parking is free at all the hotels, which is unusual but awesome. That's what happens when a hotel actually wants your business! As far as the hotel itself goes, it's great for kids and adults. They have an arcade downstairs for kids. They have everything upstairs for adults. It's cool. We checked in with \"Jeff\". He's awesome. We were friendly (at 1:30am their time) and he upgraded our room for free when I told him this was our official honeymoon before the wedding. Real sweetheart. We had a beautiful view of the 4 swimming pools and the beautiful Las Vegas mountain range every morning. I can see the Vegas strip any time. The beds were hard and we were unable to sleep the first night but we called housekeeping and had them put egg crate foam on our mattresses and then it was ok. They were awesome too. The rooms were nice, bathroom had a huge shower, no tub. Who needs a tub anyway. It was great for two to shower, which we did and enjoyed the big space to move around in. Water pressure was great, not like those dribbly showers in most hotels and we were on the 17th floor. We tipped the maid to NOT make our bed cause we don't like to pull the sheets out every night from the foot end. Nice. I'm told if you put clothes on the bed, the maid isn't allowed to make your bed. They can't touch your things. The only complaint I have about the hotel itself is that they seemed to be lacking in the ventilation department. Here in Ontario we aren't used to smoky casinos. It's a no no. They need to update their ventilation system because we found it the smokiest casino of all the hotels we went into. Other than that it was a fully self contained hotel. It even had a Starbucks, MacDonalds and plenty of other neat stores in it to shop around in. You didn't really have to leave the hotel for anything. They have the most AWESOME food deal on the strip. $25 all you can eat all day buffet. IT WAS WORTH EVERY DIME! The food was great. We never went hungry and because we had a car we could come and go as we pleased. I even bought a Lanyard and filled it with ice chips, ice cream and fruit juice. It made an awesome slushy. It was about 85-90 degrees of dry heat every day. If you tip the servers a couple of bucks they will get you extras you don't see on the buffet. My hubby loves lemon meringe pie. He mentioned it and they brought him a piece although we didn't see any out the whole week. We gave them extra tips for that. Most hotels, including this one, have escalators to take you everywhere and moving sidewalks. It's nice after walking for hours. Oh yeah, those creepy people at each entrance and all over the hotel who want to give you free stuff...... unless you have a day to waste, don't take their free stuff. They promise to only take 1-2 hours of your time \"depending on your level of interest\" and you also get a \"free lunch\". You get your \"free stuff\" alright but friends of mine ended up going and the truth was they haul you off on a a buss to a resort far away so you are stranded and dependent on them. The 1-2 hours was more like 4-6 hours. The free lunch were stale sandwiches that they couldn't stomach and the time share...... oh did I forget to mention that? The timeshare was $40 000.00 plus $700 a month maintenance fee! Eeeeek! Of course the prices get cheaper when you argue but the bottom line was still expensive and the amount of time you get to spend every year goes down. Total rip off. Just smile and tell them you're not staying past today. The hotel spa and swimming poos was like none I've ever seen. They have a pool for kids, a pool for everyone, a pool for adults only and a pool for kids and the young at heart with a water fall and waterslide. It was nice. The lounge chairs are fairly new, comfortable and we NEVER had to fight over them because there were so many pools and so many lounges. Awesome! Nobody reserves them at 7 am and when you leave you take your towel and the next person gets the chair. Awesomely simple isn't it? Every night they clean the whole deck with a mini Zambone. The pools are not very deep but refreshing in the desert, just the right temperature. Only problem is the pool closes at 6. I like to go for a midnight dip or at least late night. During the day there are lifeguards everywhere. Oh yeah, please remember you're in the hot dry desert and dont' spend a 1/2 hour in the whirlpools..... duh! Some poor unfortunate soul ended up having a stroke in the hottub and they had to fish him out and take him to the hospital. Overall I would stay here again...... most definitely. We also say Hoover Dam and the Canyon, South Rim. Don't get ripped off at the West Rim , take the 5 1/2 hour drive to the South Rim. It's worth it. I know the new bridge is at the west rim but it'll cost ya an arm and a leg to get in and out and around. They don't allow you to take pictures off that glass bridge either.

They are the friendly people in the blue blazers that act like the care about you when you walk in. If someone says the following to you: \"Where are you guys from\", or \"Is this your first time here\" when you walk in the door they are most likely timeshare people. Simply look at them and say no thank you. They know the drill and leave you alone; the key is to not stop walking. The check in desk is to the left of the main entrance when you go in the hotel, you can sight see later. Check In: There was a long line to check in, but it moved quickly. We waited maybe 10 minutes, not bad at all. The young lady that checked us in was very nice and the whole process at the desk took about 3 minutes. Room: After reading several reviews I opted for the safer bet in my opinion and booked a wide screen room. These rooms are in Tower 2. We were not disappointed. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the air conditioning worked great. The showers drained a little slow, but I have that happen at most hotels. TV was nice, but we never used it really, it\u2019s Vegas. Cleaning Staff: Our cleaning staff was awesome. Some days we didn\u2019t leave the room until after 1pm, but our room was always cleaned when we returned. At any hotel I like to leave a $5 tip on the nightstand each day before we go out. I leave a note requesting extra towels every day, cups, etc., and this has always gotten my requests filled no problems, the Excalibur was no exception. At the least I figure the tip gives them extra motivation to clean my room regardless of the time I leave. Location: This hotel is in the best location in my opinion. It is a cheap $15 + tip taxi fare from the airport or an easy drive if you rent a car. If you choose other hotels like Bally\u2019s you have to fight the strip traffic, which is horrible at best. It\u2019s a 20-25 min walk from here to the Bellagio which is in the middle of the strip. Families: If you are one of the many people that say hey, I want to take my kid to \u201cSin City\u201d this info is for you. This hotel has a several things that would appeal to kids, mainly an overpriced arcade, and a statue of Sponge Bob. *Remember this is Vegas, so Sponge Bob is roughly 15ft from a Liquor Bar, 25ft from the Gaming Tables, and depending on the time of day only 40ft from women in very little clothing dancing on a stage.

We were immediately accosted by the annoying Time share folks, after six days of this we got very good at avoiding them. First appearance of the room reminds you of the 70's, quite outdated and even though I requested non-smoking I am not convinced that is what we got but we were not disappointed overall; especially for the price and location. The room started to take on a moldy smell but we were hardly in the room so we didn't let it bother us. I will tell you that you might want to pack earplugs like we did, the air conditioner is VERY loud and you can't control loud people in the hallways. The earplugs were a lifesaver. The casino was fun and I made money there a few times. Cocktail waitresses are hard to flag down but it was like that at most casinos we visited. If you play poker like we do, never had any trouble getting drinks at the poker tables at Monte Carlo, Excalibur, Harrah's, Osheas, Venetian, etc. The Monte Carlo was by far our favorite poker room as the staff is very friendly, service is great and the bathrooms are right there. The pool which I only made it to once is very nice and does have one adult only area, although most of the folks were very newly of age I believe. I am 37 and felt quite old as the twenty somethings challenged each other to handstand competitions.....but the pool area was nice and drinks were reasonably priced. That leads to another topic - children. Why on earth would people think that Vegas is a good family vacation? I am seriously confused by this...most of the kids we saw were running without supervision, crying or yelling. Not to mention dodging drunks, smut cards advertising bill boards, gambling and go go dancers - how about Disneyworld or a cruise instead? Seriously I have children so I get the need to get away, but when I go to Vegas my teens get to hang with Grandma and when we do a family trip it is to the coast or a cruise. As far as food goes we only ate McDonalds, Baja Fresh, Krispy Kreme and Starbucks and all those were fine for a quick grab. Also the Dog and draft at the bar for $2.50 made a great mid-day snack. We ate at the Luxor buffet several times and the one at Monte Carlo and both were very good. All in all we had a wonderful time and the Excalibur was a great place to stay. The price is right and while not fancy it certainly serves it's purpose. I would stay there again.

We had a 9 hour flight so all we wanted to do on the first night was get some food and a shower then hit our beds, at about midnight we were awoken to lots of screaming and shouting from a group of noisy teenagers we asked nicely for them to keep the noise down only for the volume to increase and then doors began to slam, i am not the most tolerant of people and espically when i am woken up so i then called security and the noise decreased only for it to do up again a hour or so later this went on all night. when i went to the reception the next morning to ask to be moved i was told it would cost me $60 as this would include an upgrade i said i would pay, the receptionist went away then came back and said it would be free of charge as all the noise we had encountered the night before. This was a nice gesture on the hotel's part, the room was lovley and clean and very quiet the maid service was prompt and cannot be faulted. In Vegas you do alot of walking but this suits me as i love to be outside and there is so much to see and do, the food was great and i must say my favourite place to eat was the Harley Davidson cafe. Overall Vegas is a great holiday i loved it and cannot fault any service i recieved there i returned to the uk on Saturday the 2nd May, on Sunday 3rd May i had re booked to return. One thing that made me laugh is there was a homeless man sitting on the path with a sign that said 'Why lie i need beer' i had to give him a few dollers just for the honesty.

The coolest part was that the hot tub was tucked inside the turret, so I felt like a queen waving to my subjects from the window.

Upgraded to Widesecreen King Spa Room #14201. The spa rooms are not frequently booked, so not exposed to as much traffic as the other widescreen rooms; $70 additional per night to upgrade and well worth the $$. The list is long of resorts we have stayed on the Strip. Our favorite remains THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. However, the room and deal we received on upgrades at Exalibur proved a fantastic choice for us this go-around. The spa jacuzzi in our room was huge and mutually enjoyed by myself and my spouse. The bathroom in this upgraded room is much larger than the basic widescreen rooms, granite countertops, hair dryer, makeup mirror (all normal Vegas 4-5 resort amenities). The shower had been re-tiled and the grout was a brownish color, which at first glance was concerning as it appeared dirty. It wasn't. The room was immaculately cleaned, and I am a germophobe, so to say that is a great compliment to the housekeeping and maintenance staff, who were tipped accordingly. Our king bed was very comfortable and sheets were changed, although we were only there 2 nights. We reserved a cabana at the adult-only pool. This was the key factor in choosing Excalibur rather than THEhotel this visit, as the cabanas at Mandalay Bay are very pricey. We were charged only $80 for a cabana at Excalibur, and were allowed use of a $20 coupon provided to us at check-in, so the end cost was a mere $60 from 9am to 6pm for the cabana. Julio from Spain was our cabana boy and he did a fabulous job hosting. He checked in on us numerous times through the day and was a joy to have around. We generously tipped Julio, as well as our server, who made sure we had everything we needed at all times. We consumed many cocktails at the pool and recommend the Bahama Mama! We ordered lunch from Drenched through our server and they promptly delivered our order to our cabana. Drench provided fresh and delicious food, and total cost for lunch was under $20 for the 2 of us! We purchased some bath salts at the poolside spa to use in our room spa jacuzzi, and again prices were much lower than expected in the spa for products and services alike. The adult pool at Excalibur's pool complex of 4 separate pool areas, which were all open and used, was a great atmosphere. Good music, very attentive servers, a laid back and relaxed vibe, and not at all over crowded. The water was nice and cool, the pool and pool area very clean and well maintained. Having a cabana was icing on the cake and allowed for an enjoyable day at the pool, with a place to be shaded and lounge around in between getting wet and sun bathing. An awesome retreat with fruit basket, stocked fridge of juices and bottled water, plenty of towels, plasma big screen TV, raft for the pool, and a personal cabana host and server! Highly recommend. Excalibur can certainly be done on a budget, with fast food available in a food court upstairs and rooms on the cheap if you have budget restrictions. However, if you do splurge and spend the extra for upgrades and extravagances, you will find that with all those upgrades purchased, you will have spent less than you would at THEhotel on the room alone. My husband indicated he would not hesitate to book at Excalibur in the future, given what we got for the money we spent. If the resort as a whole was along the line of what we experienced with our upgraded room and cabana experience, Excalibur would easily be rated 4-5 star. They should update their casino and restaurants, upgrade Tower I, and add a little class to the atmosphere that may possibly draw a slightly classier base of clientele, which would be an enormous improvement. Gambling at Exalibur left a lot to be desired, as it does tend to attrack less experienced gamers because of the low table limits, which is an enormous annoyance to me. I witnessed a nasty comment and glare at a blackjack table by a player when another player hit 15 and the dealer was showing a Jack. I tried to bite my tongue, but had to point out that it was the right thing to do and there is such a thing as gambling ettiquette, which other experienced gamblers who know what they are doing expect from mutual players. Ridiculous, but not worth another breath. Gamble somewhere else - problem solved! Lots of people who probably should not have been gambling in the first place! Did not eat at any of the restaurants on site, as we had plans at other locales, with the exception of one breakfast at Sherwood Forest Cafe which was above average in price and quality. Recommend Kahunaville at TI and Tacos & Tequila Mariachi Sunday Brunch and 2 for 1 margaritas at Luxor; both visited on this trip and both exceeded expectations in food quality and atmosphere. Last, but not least, I feel the need to address the ongoing debate of bringing your kids to Vegas. Simply put - DON'T! Vegas is not an entertainment destination for children - PERIOD! People who bring their small children to Vegas need to research destinations where general theming is not targeted to adults around alcohol, gambling, sexual content, adult humor, and the fact that the majority are there to get away from kids. Nothing irritates me more than dropping $100 on a meal and having to endure crying children the entire time because their parents don't understand or care that they are BORED and TIRED and TICKED OFF because they've been in that stroller for 12 hours. It's a shame and I feel so sorry for those kids. Those parents don't even get it! If there is one thing that Vegas could improve upon, it is the fact that there is an enormous demand for adult only resorts on the strip. I don't understand why Wynn or MGM properties haven't tapped into that yet. You should at least have that option in Vegas and I think it would quickly prove to be extremely profitable. I would definitely pay more for a child-free Vegas experience.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "bazilry", "ReviewID": "UR33602616", "Content": "Great hotel on a budget, rooms a good size, clean and staff friendly.

Excalibur had it. Fantasy Faire downstairs of the lobby had carnival midway-type games and Chuck E Cheese type games, so the kids were thrilled to stop there anytime. Plus, we got a lot of buy-one-game-get-one-free coupons from the aggressive time-share hucksters upstairs. (I don't mind listening to their sales pitch for a minute or two to see what freebie I can get. However, they are all over and as pesky as flies, so some people might be very annoyed by them.) The pool area was also a HUGE hit with the kids. The pools are large. One pool had 2 waterslides and 2 waterfalls, which we all enjoyed. Another has a large shallow area for the very young kids (and adult tanners), with 2 jacuzzis right next to it. A third pool has a water cascade across one side, which you can stand in front of and get a nice massage on your neck. :) I think there was also a fourth pool thet we didn't see. It may have been an adults-only pool. Overall, the pool area was THE HIT of our stay- very family friendly. The only downside- the pool hours are only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., which mystifies me. THE ROOM: We booked the cheapest room, but at check-in, I asked for a free upgrade, and we were immediately upgraded to the flat-screen room in Tower 2, which would have run an extra 20 bucks a night, so that was awesome. I'm not terribly picky about hotel rooms, and I'd say the room was adequate. The plusses: bathroom was roomy and recently upgraded, with a huge granite counters. A/C unit also had a lagre granite countertop for extra storage. Dresser was roomy enough, TV was good, the room was fairly clean, the linens were good, housekeeping was good. Nice view of New York New York and some of the Strip. The minuses: Only a shower, no bath, and the bathroom grout was dirty, which gives me the creeps. Carpet was kind of worn, and the beds were made with only sheets and a very light blanket, no bedspreads. We had to ask for extra blankets, which housekeeping brought within half an hour. Though the room was mostly quiet, you could always sort of hear the sound of the roller-coaster next door. THE FOOD: We tried the fast-food on location- too expensive and not very good. We tried the all-day buffet one day, and weren't terribly impressed. It was just okay. The only offerings that were really tasty were the sushi and the fish. The main thing the buffet had going for it was that it was cheap. To be honest, I think the next time I stay here, I'll bring a mini-fridge and microwave, and hit the CVS or Walgreens for canned/frozen food and cereal. (Or rent a fridge, because I think they provide them for an extra fee.) The free drinks when gambling and the drinks by the pool were pretty watered down. THE SERVICE: Hit-or-miss. Check-in and check-out lines were HUGE, and it was a slow weekday. Took 30 minutes to get to the front of the check in line. Check in girl was friendly and efficient. Help desk girl was not. Cocktail waitresses were mostly friendly, with one exception. Restaurant staff was so-so. Dealers were mostly friendly and informative, though a couple had the personality of cardboard boxes. Tip- save yourself some hassle and use the self-checkout, which takes 5 minutes, rather than checking out at the desk, with its 45-minute line. INTERNET: They charge extra for in-room internet usage. Or you can go to the Krispy Kreme above the casino floor and use the free Wifi there. LOCATION: Pretty good. Free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay, which has the Shark Reef attraction. Walkways to New York New York and MGM Grand. Decent walk to Bellagio, long walk to Ceasar's, very long walk to Treasure Island. DO NOT, under any circumstances, make the mistake we made, and think you're going to walk from Excalibur to Circus Circus. You can do it, but it will take you an hour and a half in the desert heat. (In fact, Circus Circus is pretty much a dive, so not sure even the Adventuredome mades it worth the trip.) OVERALL: A good experience overall. Next time we will definitely bring/rent our own fridge/microwave because we spent most of our money on blah food.

We stayed in tower 1 in december 08 and were not disappointed.

The decor and furnishings were tastefully done. Hardly spent anytime in the room but pleasant to wake up in. The maids cleaned the room and prepared fresh towels every single day. Tower 2 is the best location for the pool, fitness suite and spa. The excalibur has 4 pools and one of them is adult only so no screaming annoying kids allowed. The hotel was advertising a $25 all day buffet so we tried it and were impressed. You get a wrist band and can eat as many times as you like. We had a huge breakfast, left the pool at lunch to revisit for a salad and fruit and a few glasses of juice and finished the day with a nice dinner.

On arrival to the hotel I checked in straight away and was upgraded to the Widescreen room on 25 Floor (at no extra cost), overlooking the pool area. The room was very clean and tidy. The hotel has been looked after very well. Also it has one of the best buffets on the strip. All you can eat, all day (07:00 - 22:00) for $25.00 each. The food is also very good. The only thing that I could not understand was why the pool was only open between 09:00 - 18:00. After this time you could not even sit outside by the bar area in the evenings. The only thing I could come up with is that they want you in the casinos. Anyway the hotel is in one of the best locations and has walkways to Luxor, MGM, New York New York. The food and drink is priced well, but like all the hotels you can expect to pay between $5.00 - $10.00 for a beer at the bar.

We picked it because my husband had stayed there before and we were traveling on a bit of a budget and he was happy enough with it before (besides, you're barely in your room anyway!) It's a decent hotel for the price, close to the action of the strip and connected to everything. We stayed in the older, more run down tower, but it was ok. There were quite a few families obviously, and there isn't much in the hotel to draw you to stay. It's very much a family oriented hotel. My biggest complaint is the people from Vacation Village and Tahiti Village who constantly bombard you with solicitations the moment you walk in the door. Before we had even checked in, we were whisked away by a rep from them and it was really unclear immediately if they were with the hotel or not, which they aren't. My advice is to head straight to check in and tell those people NO THANKS. It's really unfortunate that they are allowed to bother hotel guests like that in Excalibur and other lower priced hotels. If I was Excalibur, I would never ever let them do that, let alone give them an area in which to do it. By the end of your stay, you are so tired of being asked \"Do you want free show tickets! Are you married! Hey, are you staying here? HEY COME HERE YOU\", you are just rude to them. Anyway, the hotel was dated, but OK. The view from our room was pretty neat. Our mattress had a big unsightly red stain on it, which in Vegas could be a lot of different substances. We thought about asking for a different room but I decided I didn't care and just dealt with it. Still, they should probably replace that mattress. Ew. Other than that, everything seemed clean. The king sized bed was nice. The TV only gets like 5 watchable channels, so we watched a lot of CNN. The service was OK. The maid service seemed to be efficient when we had it. The front desk was quick and gruff. Baggage storage was OK, but everyone always seemed to awkwardly pause and stare at you for a tip. The hotel charges a \"resort fee\" which I didn't really understand. We were charged $27 and then $5 a day, and she didn't explain it very well other than to make sure we signed for our \"coupons\" which included stupid crap like $5 in free slot play and a couple of free well drinks. Oh boy. The location is OK. We ended up taking the monorail or Deuce down to the middle of the strip usually. If you have the resources to, I would probably suggest staying more in the middle, but it's not that big of a deal. I thought the monorail was ok for the times we used it (to get from Excalibur to the Sahara quickly), otherwise I liked the Deuce a lot. It's very tourist friendly, though $3 for one trip is kind of a lot so in the future I would get the 24 hr pass. Also, the high speed internet is really expensive. Krispy Kreme has free wifi. Overall, the value for what you get in this hotel makes it worth staying in if you are trying to do Vegas on a budget or save your money for experiences rather than hotel amenities. I probably won't stay here again because I hope to travel the Vegas again in the future when we're more financially stable and I want to stay in a cooler hotel, but I wouldn't tell someone to avoid it.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Okanagan Valley", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "okvalley", "ReviewID": "UR32614220", "Content": "2nd time to Las Vegas and 1st time at this hotel.

We read Trip Advisor for months before we left and this site helped us make an informed decision. Maybe this can help you. We stayed in tower 2, 26th floor, room..maybe 559? (26559)..It was a request of ours to have a pool side view so we would have easy access to pool entrance door. We did have a great view and could see where the sun was (Mostly everywhere! Just what we wanted!) and the shade was(not much except if blocked by building or a few trees early in the am) and the empty chairs were. If you are in tower 2 and above the 18th floor, you have your own set of 3 elevators. Those of us that were \"on the higher floors\" (there are 28 floors..) entered the elevators marked floor 18-28. Self explanatory. The others, floors 1-17..Our elevator was quick! No waiting for the first 18 floors to get on and off. We never waited more than a few moments. The pool itself was visited by us everyday of stay between 9 and 10 am- we typically left between 11:30 and 1:00. \"Drenched\", the pool cafe and bar, was very good. We shared a turkey club sandwich that came with our choice of waffle fries(or other options) and some fresh fruit, such as grapes and pineapple. The food was good, served quickly, ample amounts and reasonably priced. ($9.00 before tip)..we also had the Bahama Mama drink 2 days, served poolside by a waitress/runner..($9.00 as opposed to $14.00 our friends paid for same drink at Bellagio)- First day was VERY good..second one,, just good..not as slushie. Be patient with the ladies as they are taking care of 4 pools. Pools do open at 9:00 a.m..but the larger pool, first out tower 2 door, opened at 10:00? (Maybe 11:00) Read the sign..we always headed to back pool on left..adults, over age 18. (with signs and WAS ENFORCED during our stay) Several adults were politely asked to use 1 of the other 3 pools for their children, Most chose the waterslide pool. At this pool (the adult), there was a wading/walking/cooling off pool of 10 inches connected to a 3 foot pool in depth. Hot Tub was also located in this area. (There was another hottub at pool in front of this one) Most pools seemed to be at least 3 ft something.. There was top music playing. Not trashy, not full on rock or rap but mostly toe tapping up to date stuff. Lots of American Idols played, we noticed..even Kris Allen from this years show, new song, was played! Not a boring pool at all. Nice cabanas (they were offering on Thursday of our stay, a price of 60.00, as we overheard to a patron) Large flat screen TV, ceiling fan, fridge with juice and water, rataan outdoor cushioned sofa, coffee table, table and 2 chairs and sun loungers directly in front. They seemed very nice! There was also access to bathrooms, and outdoor showers. Their was also a small shop with bagged snacks, magazines, books, bathing suits, towels, hats, purses, cold drinks..just to name some, right there at pool side! I mention the pools a lot in this review, because during the summer, we wanted a nice but not overcrowded pool, but hopping too, not \"old fogey\" type stuff. For us, it was perfect! It was a nice mixed crowd, not full of kids as we have read. Young and Old alike, enjoying the sun and the water and refreshments-. (they did close at either 5 or 6, depending on day of stay) The casino had all games and slots that we needed..I even hit some for above $100.00-$200.00 on a 30 cent credit!! More than 1 time! Husband lost his shirt most days at craps, but had a good time (a least a \"shirt\" HIS size..maybe not the right size for some, apprx $100-$200 a day). Good crowd playing, he said. Pit boss asked on last night if there was anything he could for him (my husband). He requested late check out be arranged. and low and behold..it was DONE! No charge for a 3:00 check out, ($25.00 normally) and arranged for 1 day stay comped for us! We appreciated it! It was not very smokey to me..I am a non smoker, husband is a smoker in garage or outside. I thought Flamingo was worse than Excalibur anyday! Drink service for me at the slots was sorta slow to non existant a couple of nights, but at the tables..flowed easily! The casino itself does have many things to offer various aged visitors.. Downstairs is an area for kids and kids at heart, with carnival games and video games, stationary rides, the Tournament of Kings (we could see the horse stables from our room!)-- Main floor casino offers Dicks Last Resort Rest and Bar, Baha Fresh (which was great and reasonably priced).. Sherwood Forest Bar (Hotdog and draft beer for 2.50 with player card! It was good! Beer kinda tiny though, not a 16 oz), Sherwood Forest cafe- 24 hour restaurant HOWEVER, not known to us until we came back to Excalibur at 2:30 a.m. and was going to grab an early breakfast..they CLOSED at 2:00 according to the small billboard sized sign at entrance of cafe.. we ended up at McDonald's upstairs! At the entrance of each tower, just by elevators, there was a coffee, water,muffin, sandwich counter offered, (although hubby went down at 4:30 am to get a cup and they were not opened yet- again, went to McDonalds (that YES, it does have the 1.00 menu!) We stopped in the \"Lounge\" a couple of nights- bands played each night- karaoke earlier in 1 evening- good sounds from there with live bands- no charge!, Tasteful music- 1 of the female singers had auditioned for American Idol and let out the Jennifer Hudson song: And I'm Telling You, from Dream Girls..the little gal had a good set of pipes! and Yes, at the party pit (table games), near Dicks Last Resort, was a gal dancing, I am guessing starting in late afternoon..(Never saw this in midday or morning)- Was not bad, but I am pretty liberal and it IS a Las Vegas Casino and there ARE other entrances! An escalator ride to the next level placed you in the food court area, with the Italian rest, the Steakhouse, the Buffet..non of which we ate at this vist but look forward to next time. Yes, the buffet was 25.00 a person, eat all day- (Patrons wore wrist bands of different colors each day), the Italian offered 20.00 3 course meal, all you can eat salad and breadsticks, and the steakhouse a 25.00 special also..there was shopping at a convenience store, an Everything is 10.00 store, a clothing store or two with reasonable prices..and a food court, some of the ones I remember were Quiznos, Pizza Hut, a Cold Stone Creamery, I think..and of course, McDonalds! (There are other things up there, I just don't remember them all) At the front castle entrance there was a \"Pearl Factory\" store, which, last yr, my husband chose some awesome pearls and we had them mounted to necklace pendants- also, a convenience type store there too! A Game, to give a prize for guessing your weight or age..the Bar selling certain drinks with the souvenior glass, and 1-2 days we were there, a gal taking pictures at a fee, under a flowered wooden arch. Must not have been too badly priced, many were doing it! The front desk checkin, at 3:00 on a Sat was great! About 8-10 people on the line checking us..went quickly, professionally, and with no mistakes or errors. We left our bags on check out day, also No problem, tipped at least a buck per bag- was efficient and correct the first time! There was no long stays in the hallway of trays or food. There were some that were there a few hours, maybe, but were picked up soon after! and what really made our stay even more enjoyable, was our housekeeper, Elsa...I believe! She was fantastic! Pleasant, smiling, happy and can you believe this.. THANKED us personally when we saw her in hall for a tip we left her. We typically use housekeeping every other day for stays of 4 days or more..she was on it! If we left the room by 9:00 and returned by noon, it was done! Cleaned and restocked with towels, as needed. Follow the directions and place towels in shower if needed to be changed, and they were replaced! (there was an extra set under bathroom vanity behind ice bucket, if needed! The shower stall was big enough for two. Nice wall mirror, solid surface counter, makeup mirror to pull away from wall. We never had a problem with drainage, the shower head, water pressure or HOT water. Was never a problem! It was not perfect grout and tile work, but was not \"gross\" by any means- the wall papaer was older, and not in perfect condition and the 1 main thing I missed in the room, was a full length mirror! Gotta see what the shoes look like with the outfit! The safe worked great and was part of the \"5.00 a day resort fee\" we were made aware of when booking (and received 2 drink coupons, 2 fitness room day passes,and 2 midway games for \"no charge\")- I did not see fitness room, got enough walking in!! nor did I see or use the spa..but I did see the water massager in the hall on the way to pool. Sorta wish I would have tried it out! Iron and board in closet- our room offered 5 hangers, but no pant clips on them, but did have dry cleaning papers in closet available. We got pizza coupns placed under our door each day- the room service book is in room and on the TV station. Wish one of the channels had been the Weather Channel but was able to get most weather from Today show local breaks- 2 additional channels were Excalibur channels and Vegas channel. Maybe about 10 more? The room was clean- no coffee maker as in MOST ALL casino hotels on strip! Not a surprise- we packed one and took with us- a 5 cupper..ice on each floor easy to get to. King bed and bedding were fine. Table and 2 chairs, air conditoner worked just great! Window opened a crack, about 1-2 inches, just to stick your hand out and see \"How hot is it?- Dresser and night stands were good. Table lamps offered plugs in them for our phone chargers. The was an internet connection in room with instructions and cost which we did not read or use or need. I had read there was NO deadbolt on door..NOT TRUE. It is built in handle..once door is shut, turn handle UPWARD for deadlock engage! We did use radio/alarm clock/ mp3 player/charger several times...worked fine. Great Location-for us. We would take duece from in front of MGN or monorail from MGM if needed- although the walk thru MGM TO the monorail is hideous! HA! Might as well walk to Flamingo again for all the ground covered! We liked heading across the walks to NYNY or Tropicana easily- Easy walk to Hooters behind Trop. Picked up cab from Hooters to Ellis Island one day- 5.00- 6.00 bucks maybe..Free Shuttle to Hard Rock Cafe beside MGM..used that! Monorails to Luxor and Mandelay Bay free...never had a problem getting a taxi at Excalibur! Overall, we will stay again! We think for the money they charged us per night, what we are willing to pay, and the services offered at this casino/ hotel on the strip, we made a great choice for us!

The service in general is relatively poor. Our room was one of the newly renovated \"HD rooms\". However, when we entered our room, our blankets had holes in them, our pillow sheets were stained, our chairs were torn up, AND the toilet was busted. Not to mention that they only had 1 set of towels and washcloths for a room of 3 occupants. While most casinos have happy and upbeat staff members, the Excalibur's staff would barely make eye-contact with us and kept speaking to a minimum with no excitement in their tone of voice. Some things about the Casino are pretty cool. It has a few cool little souvenir shops upstairs by the food court. The food court itselfs offers a wide range of meal choices, from fast food to all you can eat buffets to steakhouses to top-level restaurants. Another cool part of the casino is the newly refurbished pool area. Relaxing at the pool is a perfect way to relax after a long night of winning big (hopefully!)! Also, for those with families, this is one of the most kid-friendly casinos on the strip. There's a snack bar right next to a big slots area so parents can play a little while still keeping an eye on their kids. There's also a huge carnival-style arcade downstairs complete with Carnival Games, Skeeball, Multiple HUGE Crane Machines, an arcade, and a 3D motion picture theatre.

Stayed in Tower 2, but met some folks staying in Tower 1 and they had a very similar room to ours, so not sure if they are slowly renovating that side as well. We paid $20 a nite for an upgrade, but after seeing their room, we would have been happy in it. The rooms were nicely upgraded, large bathroom - which is great for 3 gals. The rooms aren't exactly sound proof though, you can hear conversations being had while walking down the hall, not to mention \"other\" sounds in the hallway. We paid $65 a nite and it was perfect. We weren't expecting a $250 hotel room, we were expecting a $65 hotel room and it was well worth the price. The hotel is as smokey as everyone says it is. After going through a large majority of hotels, the only ones that don't smell of smoke are the 4stars and better. It was tolerable, but we didn't spend much time in the casino there because of the smell. The staff was very friendly all around. We loved the pool area and spent 3 days hanging out by the pool. We rented a cabana for 2 days, which just made us feel a little bit more like we were on a vacation. Good value for $55 a day, with a bar fridge, couch and a fan to keep you cool. The poolside lunch seemed a little pricey, but it was money well spent as the food was good and plenty of it. The hotel is right next to NY NY which is awesome, the dualing piano's and Irish pub are a lot of fun! We never ate at the buffet in the Excalibur, but we did take the 3minute walkway over to Luxor and ate there, which seemed a wee bit better. All in all a great trip. The pool area, although not lush and tropical, was nice with 4 pools and plenty of chairs etc. Nice rooms, with great value (those complaining were obviously expecting a 5 star hotel at 3 star prices) Would stay here again for the price, location, friendliness of staff and overall experience.

We booked an air/hotel package through Expedia, with a standard (tower 1) room. Location: At \"the other 4 corners\", Excalibur is at the heart of the Southern Strip, but still a lengthy walk from the monorail station at the back of MGM. Takes about 20 minutes to get from your room to the monorail-- and that's if you don't stop anywhere. Still, that's better than Mandalay or Luxor! Check-in: Check-in was quick and painless, and we used the \"$20 trick\" to get upgraded to a tower 2 widescreen room on the 22nd floor, with a great view of the pool. Avoid the advertised price of $20 per night; the tip works just fine. Plus, the entrance to the pool area is directly at the bottom of the tower 2 elevator; tower 1 guests have to walk a mile to get there. You can check out from your tv; any in-room charges will simply go on your credit card. They provide a drop box for keys. As for the timeshare salespeople, they're annoying as hell, but you have to remember they're just trying to earn a living. Just politely ignore them or say \"no thank you\" and they'll leave you alone. Still, they should NOT be allowed to approach guests with \"free vouchers\" just as they leave check-in, luggage in tow, and obviously visibly tired. Room: Rooms were basic and clean, and there is an electronic safe available for no extra cost-- great for storing your money/passports/etc. Very few channels available on the 42\" tv, but hey, who goes to Vegas to watch tv anyways? Although we were on a no-smoking floor, you could smell smoke through the hallways (but none in our room). A/C was cool and quiet. Pool: Pool area was large with 4 pools and lots of chairs; poolside drinks are VERY expensive ($7 for beer, $9 for cocktails). Save money and buy at the small store at the bottom of the elevator-- beer is 2/$6 and they're in plastic bottles, making them pool-friendly. Pool hours are from 9-6, however they only open 1 pool at a time, and it's usually 11:00 before all 4 pools are open. Food: Food at the poolside cafe \"Drenched\" is pricey, but very good. We didn't eat at any of the themed restaurants, most of our food was bought at various spots in the food court, with Manchu Wok being our favorite. Pizza Hut Express is also great if you're in a hurry. Casino: Large and definitely odd-shaped. Lots of low-limit table games and slots, but very poor drink service, even to good tippers. Better drink service can be found at any other casino within walking distance, and more than once we went next door to Luxor, where even penny slot players get good drink service. Other random thoughts: For location, cleanliness, amenities and price, Excalibur can't be beat. It doesn't offer the best of any one thing, but for $400 for 8 nights in a widescreen room, you won't do better anywhere else. The kid \"problem\" isn't near as bad as people make it out to be (try spending an hour at Circus Circus!), and the Party Pit dancers aren't any worse than what you see on MTV. No child will be scarred for life by this. We didn't see any of Excalibur's shows, so we can't comment on them (nothing there really appealed to us). Would we stay there again?

First, it's location. You can walk over pedestrian bridges to the New York, New York, MGM, and Tropicana, or you can take a tram (monorail type) to the Mandalay and Luxor. A total of 5 major hotels within five minutes! Secondly, it's size. The Excalibur is big, but not so big that you feel dis-oriented or lost. (Try the MGM for that!) Third: a courteous and friendly casino staff. Fourth: value; a comparison will show that the Excalibur is more competetively priced than most major hotels in Las Vegas, and yet, they provide large rooms, great bedding, and small room amenities. Fifth: the dining opportunities; steakhouses, Italian fine-dining, a great buffet, and, if you don't want to blow your inheritance on food, a food court with a McDonald's, donut and sandwich shops, etc. (The Mickey D is especially welcome when you want a cup of coffee that doesn't cost $4.) Parking is very convenient; in my case, I could see my car from my room. By comparison, it takes over 20 minutes to access your car if you stay at MGM or Ceasar's Palace. My one complaint or recommendation is that the hotel should avoid penny and nickel charges to make up for lost revenue in these economic times. An elderly parent required a refrigerator in her room for medications and was told ther was a $15 daily charge - practically 33% of what she was paying for the room! To the Excalibur's credit, they removed that charge from the bill, nevertheless, I recommend that they review their policy of handicapped and elderly clients. If travelling with children, the hotel has great eye appeal, reminiscent of Camelot, yet, once inside, adults enjoy the atmosphere and features. Shows and amusements cater to all tastes and age groups: tournaments with medieval pageantry, night club shows, male dancers, game (strippers?), game arcade. The hotel has several large swimming pools.

I had read in a review that one guest found bed bugs in the bed so we sprayed the matress and sheets before we stayed there. We did find hair on the top of the matress cover, but no sign of bed bugs. The furnishings in our \"upgrade\" wide screen room were very plain and not broken, but the adjustable height shower head would not stay where it was put.

We also had a great view of the \"castle\" at night and our hallway was pretty quiet but the walls weren't completely soundproof. The room was immaculately clean and the high level of servicing every day was very impressive. The bed and pillows were really comfortable but I was disappointed with the lack of a bath and coffee maker. Those little comforts mean a lot at the end of a long day walking around. Unfortunately our air-con was on the noisy side so we used it sparingly. Our safe was also out of order when we arrived and when we called front desk they said they would send a locksmith asap. We went out expecting it to be done when we got back but in the mean time house keeping left a message saying they have a policy not to touch the safe without someone there (even if the safe is not in use). Though I applaud this policy you would think front desk would have known this as well. In the end we couldn't be bothered calling and waiting for the locksmith. The rooms were the only quiet part of this hotel, there was absolutely no reprieve from the slot machines, music, young party crowds and cigarette smoke; you're forced to walk through it to get in and out of the hotel. What annoyed us most was having to walk through the casino floor to get to the other tower where the pool was located. The pool was pretty crowded up until 5pm but thereafter there were always chairs available.

We had 13 people for dinner they put tables together for us and we literally had no elbow room at the tables at all.....then they wouldn't let us have separate checks had to have it all on one bill... then we all had to figure the bill out at the end which was very confusing... the service took forever...they try to give you the \"dining\" experience and after long days in vegas who wants the dining experience.... my kids were also with us and he was sleeping at the table! it took us more than 2 hours to have dinner and for the prices their food isn't good! If you are taking kids because they had kid friendly stuff to do....keep in mind the only cool thing for kids is the pool and possibly tournament of kings...we didn't do it but Im sure kids would love it. the midway is nothing like the picture on the website, it is very dated lots of the games aren't open or don't work.......it is more worth it to go to circus circus to their midway it was 100% better you feel better about wasting the money...haha!

We were just looking for a relaxing vacation. The flights were perfect. As we got to the hotel there was not one bell person at the door waiting to help with luggage. As we walked to find the check-in desk the lady at the desk did'nt even welcome us, just asked for our ID's. We finally found the elevators to our room, got to our room and found that they had put us in a non-smoking room. We unpacked and went to have some lunch. As we returned and decided to shower we found that there was a glob of hair in our shower. We were very grossed out. So we went out for the evening and as we got back to the hotel and were getting ready for bed the comforters we could tell had not been fresh and clean. They were covered with yellow and brown stains.. I was ready to leave. But as we both work in hospitality we did not want to cause a big scene and that we would talk to someone about it. We were tired after a long day of traveling. The internet access in the room was an extra charge of $15 per day, and you had to pay to use the fitness facilities...The next morning we decided that we were going to try the buffet. AS we paid $25 for the both of us for breakfast.. We discovered the food to be cold and yet it was probably great if it would have been hot.. Not worth what you pay. We went to the concierge desk and asked a few questions and it took them about 20 minutes to find one thing that we asked. So we made the best of everyday and just spent our time else were on the strip. We even went to Treasure Island and saw Mystere.. (Definetly a must in VEGAS) On the 3rd day there we decided that we were going to gamble a little. As I sat there at some slots i never got asked to have a drink. I had to go up to the bar and pay for my drinks myself... Never saw a waitress for over 45 minutes... As my friend went to play at the tables the same thing, even the dealer was a little frustrated. That night we wanted to play pool and still not one waitress waited on us or even asked if we wanted drinks..(Horrible service) So we decided that we would play elsewhere. On the day that we checked out we had brought our luggage to be checked until our flight that night and the bellman that was checking our luggage was very rude. He could barely speak english and got mad and snapped at us because he had hard time spelling our name. We were told that we could get a shuttle to the airport at 8pm. When we returned to get the shuttle they said that there was not any available, they stopped at 2pm. So we ended up having to take a cab.

The Excalibur doesn't know what it wants to be. It's obviously best to be a kid-friendly casino (like Circus-Circus), but it can't let go of the idea of being cutting edge, with go-go dancers in revealing outfits dancing next to the gaming tables. This idea works at the Hard Rock Hotel, because that's its theme (and the girls were prettier). But with the family-friendly things like the jousting dinner show, the Spongebob 4-D ride, etc., it just needs to be 100% family-friendly. Instead of having go-go dancers, have maidens in flowing dresses. Have knights walking around posing for pictures. Have a huge castle-themed playground for the kids. (That's not a stretch; they have lots of McDonald-type playgrounds at other casinos in town, like the grandparent-friendly Station and Coast casinos.) Heat the pool year-round. The pool has a new water slide, so that's a good start. My daughter picked out this hotel to stay at for her first trip to town, but it quickly became forgotten, replaced by the Stratosphere, Circus Circus and the Golden Nugget.

To get to the room we had to go past Dick's Last Resort restaurant and the \"Party Pit\" both of which were not places that you would wish to expose your kids to. Dick's Last Resort had women wearing paper hats made by the wait staff with pithy sayings such as \"My breath smells like his balls\" on them, it clearly catered for Bucks/Stag parties, college kids and those there to party. The \"Party Pit\" was home to a few gaming tables and had a catwalk behind them with chicks in their underwear dancing on it. If I was there on my own I would have had no complaints, with the kids in tow it was a different matter. The casino was smoky and certainly was not a top-end establishment. I went to get coffee early one morning and came across one woman playing the slots in her pyjamas, cig in hand and necking a beer at 7am - class! The rooms were clean and quiet, we had a widescreen room, $16 per day for internet access was a bit steep, so we didn't bother. It was a pleasant room with no real views and a smart bathroom. There is no fridge or coffee making facilities forcing a trip to the (expensive) coffee stands or the food court. Pool area was adequate, cold beer and snacks were easily accesible and biled to the room, free towels on the way in too. You pay a \"resort fee\" of $19 or so a day, these little charges certainly added up. Plentiful free parking was a useful feature. I would not stay there again. It would be fine for the party crowd.

Public areas like hallways, the casino, and especially the room \u2013 all sparkling. Check-in took a little longer than I\u2019d like, but nothing unreasonable. I asked for a quiet room and was given an \u201cinside\u201d room on the 26th floor of tower 2. I didn\u2019t know what \u201cinside\u201d meant, but it turned out to be perfect because it faced the other tower and the fun castle-looking parts of the hotel.

The Excalibur is a very nice hotel for those travelers who are not interested in spending large sums of money on hotel rooms. The rooms are large, clean, and come with all the basic amenities (toiletries, a hair dryer, ironing board, etc.) but are not fancy or lavish. My main complaint with the Excalibur is the excessive presence of timeshare sellers located throughout the hotel. You are approached every time you enter or leave the tower where your room is located, when you go to the fast food restaurants or buffet on the second level, or when you approach the lobby area. My husband and I just smile and say \"No, thanks\" as we walk by, as we know they are just doing their job. However, it quickly becomes tiring. Other things to note: The renovated pool area was very nice, and there were adequate lounge chairs considering the occupancy level of the hotel. The poolside restaurant offered very generous portions at very fair prices - my husband got a footlong hotdog for $5. The buffet offers standard fare, and there is a $25 special being offered right now for an all-day pass to the buffet. The Italian restaurant and Steakhouse are also offering prix fixe menus. There is adequate parking in a garage behind the hotel, which is located closest to Tower 2 (the tower by the pool). Tower 1 is located closest to the Strip, if this makes a difference to you.

We also enjoy staying at the Excalibur because of its location and that one can walk to the nearby hotels, attractions and shops located on the strip. However, walking at night can be a bit of a task as crowds can become large due to the present construction on the strip and the dozens of peddlars handing out \"girlie\" cards to the men walking on the street - it can become rather annoying to the many families that are walking on the strip and being confronted by these people.

I have stayed at the Excalibur multiple times now and have been satisfied with what I pay for. First of all, you need to know what is going on in Vegas during your trip. Huge conventions cause a lot of chaos among customer service counters at many hotels because of the massive amount of group bookings and people wanting the five star treatment anywhere they go. If you at this hotel and are arriving on Thursday-Saturday after 12pm the waits for your room are going to be extensive at every hotel. When you book your room and choose one king or two queens, remember you are booking upon availability. With the economy the way it is, these cheaper hotels are getting more business than the expensive ones. If you are expecting a perfectly cleaned, spotless room at any of the hotels that have been in Vegas for 15+ years you are not going to get them very often. Excalibur has done a bit of remodeling with some WIDESCREEN ROOMS. They are nice and very adequate for anyone going there to have fun and party. They are pretty basic though, you are not going to get your coffee or anything special in the room. THAT IS WHY THEY ARE $40-$80 MIDWEEK AND $80 -$150 WEEKEND. They look a little more classy in the pictures than they actually are. Everything is just a little newer. If you want a decent room for a cheap price this is the way to go. Service at the Excalibur is okay.If you are respectful of the staff they will treat you the same. Housekeeping has always done a decent job of picking up the room while we were away. They will be a lot more thorough if you leave them $5 a day. You will find the occasional hooker/prostitute at the bars if you are staying here with kids. They don't make it very obvious so don't expect to see a girl with her skirt hiked up so you can see half her butt everywhere you go down there. There are a lot of younger couples and college kids that stay at this hotel also because of the cost. Don't expect a quiet nights sleep everynight. You will not get it. The food is at the bottom end of what you kind find on the strip but it is cheap. McDonald's in house very cheap $1 Menu for breakfast/lunch. There are also some other options by the food court. Good food is close thought at Mandalay Bay or MGM. They both are within 15 minutes walking distance. The location is near the South end of the strip. You are only on a street corner between Luxor and NYNY. It is a very long walk to get to the North side near the Wynn and Riviera. The casino is relatively smoky and you definitely can smell it. Don't be surprised when you get there. This casino has been in Vegas since 1990, back then it was primarily a gambling town. It is older and is not going to be remodeled on the casino level anytime soon. People that complain about this casino needing a face lift are right but it's not going to happen so don't complain about when you get back. If you are going to be out and about shopping down the strip. I recommend staying at one of the Harrah's properties: Flamingo, Paris, Bally's or Harrah's. They are all in the same price range with Paris being the most upscale. Gambling at Excalibur has always been lucky for me. The slots have a decent payout percentage and is definitely better than the highscale properties. This casino has paid for itself many times over so they are in the black no matter what. MGM owns and runs so join there Players Club because you can gamble at all of the casinos right around it to earn comps as well. The table games at excalibur range from $5 UPWARD. Beware the farther down the strip you go and the later in the day you play the minimum does go up. Many big casinos range in the $15 - $100 minimum bet limits after 4:00PM.

Given that most of your time in Vegas is probably spent in the casino/bars/pool/shops (delete as appropriate), the room was more than adequate; very clean, big comfy bed, double shower and TV. And this was just a standard room! The casino itself was a little smokey as others have mentioned but only noticeable if you spend hours on the tables. The pool was lovely and a bonus to have an adult pool without the screaming kids and with a bit of music playing to create a lively atmosphere. There is a Pleasure Pit in the casino with a some good looking dancers strutting their stuff, although nowhere near the calibre of the PussyCat Doll Lounge at Caesars or the Croupiers at Planet Hollywood! Sorry Girls! Avoid the buffet too. There are far too many other choices nearby to waste time with queues and mediocre food. Plenty of snack options upstairs and also a Krispy Kreme which has free WiFi. There's also a 'Dog and Draft' offer at the bar for a hotdog and small beer for $2.50. Bargain! My advice is stay at Excalibur, chill by the pool all day, take a few steps over to Coyote Ugly (NYNY) and the West Wing Bar at MGM for Happy hour (5-8?) before heading out on the town where the real fun begins. If you're sober enough when you get back then a few hands of BlackJack or a Bud at Dicks is a perfect finish to a Vegas day.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for the price!\u201d", "Author": "dawn011", "ReviewID": "UR28133945", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Excalibur 4/7/09-4/11/09. Loved the location. At first it was a little confusing on how to get down to the strip. But after just about a 1/2 an hour we got our bearings and it was VERY easy to get to NYNY, MGM, and down to the strip. We should have asked someone but had a lot of fun exploring. Finding the tram to get to Luxor and Mandalay Bay was every easy. However we mostly took the moving sidewalks that are all indoors. It is not a bad walk to Planet Hollywood also. We had the standard room.The room was just fine. Very clean! The carpet was ok. We had a smoking room so it had a few very small burns but it was clean. We stayed on the 2nd floor and had a view of the Luxor. It was awesome that the window opened. Only about 3 inches but the weather was cool this time of year and it helped get the smoke out of the room. The beds were very comfortable. We did have a safe in the room. While it is not a 5 star hotel it was WELL worth the price. I did see a few children. However it was not out of control. The casino was great. Lot's of penny slots and penny poker. The craps table's were HOT. We got the all day buffet only once and that was enough. Breakfast was very good but lunch and dinner was well... awful. We ordered room service one eveing and the food was good and the service was fast. The only thing we did not like is that they did not tell us that we had to set it up so we could charge to the room when we checked in, So we had to pay cash for the food. Which was fine but we would have much rather have charged it to the room. The best advice I can give you is DO NOT do one of the timeshare deal's. They offered us a show and $100 in casino credit if we did it. We were told that it would only take 1 1/2 hours... Took 2 1/2 hours the show was worthless (V at planet hollywood)and only gave us $50.

We arrived at the Excalibur mid-afternoon and found a long line to check in. It wasn't bad though as they had most of their check in desk open and they were relatively fast in checking everyone in. Our room was in Tower 1 and faced Tower 2, with no real views. It was fine as we didn't spend much time in our room looking out the window. Our room was a bit on the small side and is definately showing some serious wear and tear. The chairs were scratched up and needed some new upholstery. The beds were horrible! You could feel every spring on your back as you rolled around. The pillows weren't any better! Your head just sank through the pillows. You needed at least 2-3 for you to feel them, LOL. We also found that the A/C unit in our room was not working! But instead of the front desk moving us (they said to just wait out the repair - I was too tired to argue), they had maintenance come in and actually replace the huge unit. We couldn't even get comfortable as we had people in and out of our rooms during the repair. After the repair, the area was filthy and I had to get one of the cleaning ladies to come in and vacuum and she wasn't the most friendly person to deal with. I will say though, that the hotel is in an awesome location and was nearby all the attractions that we were interested in seeing. But I probably won't stay at the Excalibur again though. Most people come to Vegas to party and have fun, then you use your room to rest and sleep. But with the bed and pillows like we had, forget it! Pay a few bucks more and either upgrade your room (I assume that more expensive rooms have better beds) or go to another hotel.... Oh... The Excalibur does have a Midway for kids to play games and win prizes. A lot of the video games were in major disrepair though, but the Midway games were fun. Now, would I recommend the Excalibur?

Also we noticed that room service trolleys were being left out in the hallways outside peoples rooms for hours 7 hours at a time and the elevators were not hoovered very often leaving the carpets covered in bits.

Let me sum it up quickly \u2013 you get what you pay for. We got the cheapest room we could (it\u2019s what you do when the economy is bad and you would rather spend your money on fun activities for you and the fam), and while the room was clean, the view totally sucked. Be sure and check out the pic of our view (yes that puffy thing is a dead bird which was there when we checked in and there when we left and the other stuff \u2013 cigarette butts and prostitute flyers). Enough said as far as the view. On to the rest, even though the check in line was quite long, it moved rather fast for its length. I think we were checked into our room within 20 \u2013 25 minutes. There was no hard sell on an upgrade room, and I was fine with that. We were approached by timeshare people way too often though. Let\u2019s just say I needed both hands to count the number of times I was approached. My youngest, 11, really enjoyed the 4D rides downstairs in the Arcade area. She also enjoyed the games. As a parent, I didn\u2019t really enjoy paying a $1.00 for each game, but hey she needed some fun too. My oldest, 16, didn\u2019t care for the 4D ride; she said it was too childish for her. Still, when we walked across the street to the roller coaster ride at New York New York, she screamed her head off and said it was awesome (missing from the purse - $14.00, a teenager saying something is cool and thanking a parent for something \u2013 priceless). As a family, we also took in the free water show at the Bellagio (this I loved). That afternoon, the choreographed water dancing was set to Sir Elton John\u2019s \u201cYour Song\u201d, and it was simply breathtaking. I could have watched it over and over again. And finally, you can\u2019t go to Vegas without gambling. At Excalibur - My husband won at the blackjack tables, and I lost at the slots. He did win enough to cover my losses though so I did bring him back home with me. The part I didn\u2019t like about the Excalibur Casino was the stank attitude of the cocktail hags. They had no personalities and only offered you drinks if you were at a table game (I had to get my husband to get drinks for me most of the time). And even when they brought him drinks, they would stand at his side like they deserved a tip. Well when you have the look and the attitude of an old drunk who hasn\u2019t been able to find a bottle in a week, then you\u2019re certainly not going to get anything from me, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to let my hubby tip them. In between those sourpusses and the cigarette smoke which was probably even too much for a fireman\u2019s mask, the casino at the Excalibur was too much for me. For the rest of the trip, I happily lost my few bills at friendlier casinos where the cocktail servers actually seemed to like their jobs and where I could freely breathe without carrying my inhaler around. I can\u2019t tell you where to stay on your next trip to Vegas, but I can tell you that the Excalibur is not the place for me. I\u2019m going to try out the Bellagio next time.

The shower was in dire need of renovation, the grout was very dirty with mold and looked like it suffered too many quick and unskilled tile repair jobs. Beds were comfy, didn't notice too much noise from neighbors. The door kept getting jammed, needed assistance to open several times from the hotel crew and there was no internal security latch. Toiletries were nice, towels clean, a housekeeping crew always seemed to be on our floor and it was easy to receive extras just for the asking by opening the door from the friendly maids. Elevators were fast and wait wasn't very long even during rush hours. I didn't notice if they had room service or not? WiFi was offered at an overpriced premium service. I don't know if the Sbx nearby have their hotspots as they do in standalone shops. Overall Hotel-our first encounter with the front desk was miserable. Very cold and unfriendly and highly unwilling to assist us with when we arrived in the middle of the night with reservations they could not accomodate since they were full. We were turned away to find on our own accord another place to stay. The other hotels in the area were also full but even without having reservations they went the extra mile to be apologetic and in one case, called around to competitors to find a hotel room that was available. We'll remember that hotel brand on our next trip for certain! Arriving by valet we had quick bell service with great personality. Unfortunately we encountered a lost item and when dealing with the hotel staff, again we were met with unacceptable levels of concern. Not only that, when addressing the matter again (merely trying to locate the lost item) we were treated very rudely and accused of lying. It was really a nightmare and I can't imagine if there was even a worse situation how they would have treated their customers. Also beware, valet becomes full very fast at this hotel on the weekends. The navigation around the hotel/casino compared to other resorts of similar size wasn't complicated, they are easily connected with indoor walkways to Luxor and then on to Mandalay Bay, the NYNY and MGM are also very easy to reach by the short outdoor overpass. Parking overall can be a challenge here. The pools were nice, one adult pool (with not the best security to keep the rugrats from wandering in) and three other pools. One pool had waterslides (tame ones) but that was closed likely because it's early pool season in Vegas. The poolside is great for full suncatching since there are no blocking buildings to the area. No problem getting a chair at the adult pool area on the weekend, but again, this is different in high summer. Also know the Excal is a \"family friendly\" hotel (using the term loosely) so this place attracts lots of kids. Beware of the resort fee they tack on to the nightly rate as well. Dining-decent choices of food including MCD's, Sbx and KK's upstairs in the food court, if you're a fan of raunchy humor, you'll like the Dick's Last Resort bar (although too bad the hotel admin seems to take the rude attitude for real as well). Didn't try the buffet, it runs a really awesome deal right now for $25 it's an all day all U can eat and couponless 2 4 1 deals. The other mid tier hotel eateries have flat rate specials too. Vegas dining is getting pricey so if you're budget minded this seems to be a good spot to keep your stomach and your wallet near. Entertainment-right now Louie Anderson is playing and the classic Tournament of Kings dinner show. The Caveman show and Thunder Down Under strippers are also on rotation in the showrooms. No free shows but I really really REALLY liked the abundance of REAL LIVE MUSIC LOUNGES! They also were featuring beer pong and karaoke on specific nights. Lots of gambling choices, avoid the 5:6 bj. MGM is the parent company and their player's card isn't very generous, but still sign up for one anyways. The Party Pit is Party Pituful, where are the scantily clad dealers to make me not care about losing the high table minimums? They had prancing dancing girls on a catwalk but nothing spectacular for Vegas and the pit area was not the optimal spot, appears squeezed in as a last minute thought as to compete against the PCD pit and comes up very short on the glam party factor. Overall, as a Vegas Veteran in the bullseye of the Vegas marketing demographic, I can't recommend this hotel when I know there are far better choices in this category to choose. Price the following hotels as a comparison: Stratosphere, Hooters, Harrahs to name a few.

When we checked in, we were offered a free upgrade because we were staying a week. Nice I thought! Then we saw the room. :O( I wonder what our original room was supposed to be like. The room was quite small. I think our room at Circus Circus 3 years ago was larger. The nicest thing about the room was the 42 inch TV screen...not that we were there to watch TV. I think it got 24 channels, but most of the stations were advertising or junk. Internet was $14.00US per day and there were no hotspots on the hotel. We didn't get the internet. There were five pools there however, only 2 of the smaller pools were open...I guess to save money by paying a smaller number of lifeguards. The pool was only open from 10 AM to 5PM each day which was quite useless as families are usually out exploring and being tourist during those hours. There was constant blaring of loud music around the pools which was annoying to hear in our room when we did happen to be there during those hours. The bed spreads had rips in the stitching. The fan/air conditioning didn't work. The shower needed to be updated as the grout was old and it looked dirty. There were a couple of extra pillows which was nice. There were not enough hangers.

When I went out by myself or hubby went out alone, we were never hassled. The arcade was not very well run. It was supposed to open at 11:00 but both times we visited there the stairs were roped off until at least 11:10. The first time that happened, we just walked past the ropes at 11:10 as there were other people walking around down there. The next time, we took the escalator. The arcade was poorly run. Machines often broke down and we needed help getting our money back. The prizes at the prize booth were disappointing. Much of it is junk. Circus Circus' arcade is MUCH better. There's an arcade at NY NY and it looked better run as well. The Round Table Buffet was pretty good...but after several days, who can handle buffets...LOL. The best deal is the eat all day for $25.00 PP. But...that means you have to be there all day or be willing to go back and forth. We took that deal on a day that we weren't going too far from the hotel. Hubby and daughter went to the buffet just before it closed for dessert and a class of milk before bed too. Also, if you have the eat all day deal, you avoid most of the lineups...which is a bonus!!! We were trying to line up a rental car and the agent needed to get back to us. They had our phone number, room number and hubby's FIRST name but not the last name and the hotel wouldn't put the call through to us. That sucked as it delayed us getting a rental car by a day. We did like the location of the hotel. The strip is HUGE...way longer that you probably would expect. The hotel you can see from your room that is only a couple of blocks away is likely 2-3 km away. So be prepared for lots of walking! BTW...if you want a good deal on a rental car, go to Fletcher-Jones Toyota and talk to Tony. We rented a RAV 4 for $35.00/day. A smaller car was $27 or $28 but they were rented out by the time we were able to get back to the rental agent. Hubby took the bus to get the car. Take your own rental car insurance if you can cuz you'll save a lot of money. The prices for a rental car at all the other agencies were $79 to $120 day as we didn't book before arrived. (We weren't sure which days we'd need the car until we got there). IHOP near the LV Outlet Mall has free Wi-Fi...but make sure your virus protection is up to date as our Virus protection quarantined a virus as soon as we connected. There are not many free WiFi spots around Vegas...at least around the strip.

I got the Widescreen Room as they called it since it has a 42\u201d plasma in the room. As far the hotel the Excalibur is a pretty old hotel; almost 20 years old. Check in was ok, I was able to do an early go at my room with no problems. The staff was nice and courteous; no issues there. The room itself was nothing to write about as it is just a bid better than the standard room. My advice to you is not to upgrade if the price is more than $50 bucks. The bathroom was dirty and moldy with handles falling or broken on the shower screen door. The linens were dirty and ripped. I was told by a supervisor that this is an outgoing problem they had. According to her they were aware of the issue and they were working on getting more durable linens in the future. As far as having a HDTV plasma in the room with only 2 HD channels is ridiculous. Again, not worth the price they charge. The Excalibur is old stingy cigarette smelling hotel for families and middle to senior folks. It offers more affordable prices south of the strip. MGM runs this hotel as well as it sister\u2019s hotels (Mandalay & Luxor). Compared to the Mandalay which I have stayed in; the Excalibur is a dump. If money is tight but you also want a little more quality then stay in the middle (Luxor). The buffet here is probably one of the cheapest in the strip since they have a special for $25, were you can eat all day. This is probably more suitable for a family rather than a couple since you would have to make the trip back to the hotel if you want to get your money\u2019s worth. One thing though, the cigarette smell is horrible at their buffet. If you\u2019re ok with that then I guess this is for you then.

The rooms are outdated with ugly orange carpet, drapes and bedding, but who cares you do not go to stay in the room.

This hotel meets the basic needs, a bed, tv, shower ect....if your picky and looking for glam and glitz pay the money to stay else where. If your looking for deal and can make due with basics stay here. Few things about the hotel they will charge you a 5 $ a day resort fee for each day you are there this is an additional charge that is not included in any package or when you book your room. Also they do not have a fridge in the room .....we just put our pop on ice in the sink or the ice bucket. They do have a safe in the rooms or atleast the two we booked had them. Some other hints: atm fees are 4.99 everywhere. .....where comfortable shoes you will be doing alot of walking,.....take a zip up sweater or ect it may seem nice 60 degrees but the wind is something else and the casinos are cooler....take mositurizer your skin/hair will be dry for days once you come back.....drink lots of water to keep from getting dehydrated.......the double decker buses there take for every to pick you up......we got impatient and took taxis which will rip you off....they are the most convienent way to travel but they take you out of your way and cost more than you think so just be prepared to pay......eat at the food courts which every hotel has (pizza hut, mc donalds ect....) it is cheaper than always doing buffets, waitresses were so very slow to get you drinks at every casino....did not expect this because everyone talks about the free drinks....not sure if due to economy they let waitresses go but you will spend more money in a machine trying to wait for a waitress to get a drink than if you just bought the drink out right.....the machines did not pay out very well and we played in almost every one on the strip.....beware of the time share people they are in every casino when you walk in they ask if you are planning to see a show and how long you are staying what you do is say you are leaving that day and they leave you alone.....also watch out for the men/women handing out nude cards of girls you will see them they are on the strip and everyone tries to hand them to you......anyways it is fun and I hope this review helps.....ps the ppols close at 6pm which kinda sucks....but hey you can swim back home.....vegas if for gambling", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cExcalibur is the BEST\u201d", "Author": "BronsonluvsVEGAS", "ReviewID": "UR27246713", "Content": "I went to Vegas for 5 days to get away, booked my hotel online.

I ended up booking the Excalibur for about $98 per night (average price for Fri/Sat night) and got a better deal thru the www.smartervegas.com website than by booking direct with the hotel. Glad to say that everything turned out OK. We got the room we booked and it was in Tower 2 - the recently renovated tower. Rooms were adequate, not great but we were hardly there so it didn't matter if there was no coffee pot, no bath tub or the mirror was too far away from the basin blah blah blah !! Check in was fine - we waited about 5 min. Beware the timeshare sales guys that pick you out as a \"newby\" literally as you walk in the door and pretend they're helping you to check in. They take you to a small counter where they hand off to someone else who starts the hard sell. We quickly worked out what was going on (after about 5 seconds) and moved on to the real check in counter around to the left. We had breakfast at the Rainforest Cafe in the MGM - just a short walk across the bridge (kids would love it - animals come to life every so often) and spent Saturday in a hire car visiting Hoover Dam and some shopping malls. So we had plenty on and spent little time critiquing the room itself. The drinks voucher gets you very little and is limited to only 1-2 bars but service was good. Did a little gambling - the only negative was that the table service for drinks was way too slow for my liking but i found this at all the casinos, particularly the Mirage.

Oh Boy! What a splendid experience! How can someone go to Vegas and not bet their life out! We drove from LA to Las Vegas and the journey was pretty quite with deserts all around and nothing interesting to lay our eyes on than my lil baby cousin who kept up our spirits, making funny sounds :) But all that boredom was long lost the minute we entered Las Vegas! A huge billboard with flashy lights that says 'Welcome to Las Vegas' Nevada, gives you the excitement of your lives. I have toured across many places but nothing excites more than Las Vegas. It was late when we reached Excalibur, then too there were hoards of people waiting for their turns to Valet park. We were all tired and thought of rushing to our beds n drop dead! But the minute we entered the hotel, Oh Laa Laa! We all just kept looking around! There was so much to see and so much to do! It was beautifully decorated, amazingly lit and very well organised as far as attracting the gamblers was concerned! I HATE gambling but this place had something great that I wanted to know everything I should about the games played! Soon as I got my room keys, I just rushed to my room. Got a little fresh and ran down with my sister and my cousin to learn the Game - Poker! I still dont know though how it is played but I thoroughly enjoyed hearing its a Draw, its a Flush.. and what not! Late night I went back to my room and through the windows I could see a brightly lit Strip! New York New York is just across Excalibur and MGM is located diagonally. I felt like on top of the world suddenly. I slept well thinking of all that I am going to do for the next couple of days, still dreaming if I was really at Las Vegas! Excalibur is beautifully located almost at the start of the famous Strip. Early morning I could see the roll-coaster at NYNY zapping up! And could hear the excited people scream! By the morning there are happy people everywhere at Las Vegas! There are some amazing Hotels to visit! We started with roaming at the Strip! Started with parking at Planet Hollywood and having a lavish breakfast there. Then we went to Venetian, The Mirage, Paris, MGM Grand, and I couldnt move wen I saw the Romance at the Bellagio! Amazing fountains that make you feel absolutely ecastic! All these Hotels had themes within! Let me tell you Las Vegas has its own beauty! Its all about Glam, Power, Beauty and Love! Excalibur definately lives up to its meaning! A fort like building, beautiful decors within, and some cool Martinis! And the best of all its Location! Its like the head of the Strip! Las Vegas time!

The lobby and casino have seen better days. Compared to other hotels, this casino is nothing special. We never had a problem getting a drink while sitting at the machines. The moving walkway in the front is nice though after a long day of walking! There is a nice little food court/shop area upstairs that was good for breakfast or a late night snack. There is a Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Quiznos, Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, those sorts of places here. The best part about this hotel is its location.

We had the newly renovated widescreen rooms with two queens. The rooms were clean and newly renovated. The decor was modern, but basic... Housekeeping did a good job, and no issues were noted within the room, besides a battery needed in the AC/Heat controller.. Which was quickly taken care of after a call to the front desk. The location is, as described, towards the end of the strip. Mandalay Bay, and the Luxor are even further down the strip, so this isnt exactly the 'end' of the strip. We thought the location was pretty good. If you were there to explore vegas and take it all in, it was perfect. We spent alot of time at NY NY, and just venturing out. It takes a bit to get the numerous entrances, and exits down, and to navigate your walks with utmost efficiency in between casinos, etc. There seems to be 5 different skywalks, elevated sidewalks, escalators, and walkways to get to each place! One word of advice for any newbie (2 out of 4 of us were new to LV)... Things are MUCH further than they appear. If you can see the building that you are trying to get to ahead - this means NOTHING! It became a bit of a joke towards the end. The Eiffel Tower seemed like it was two blocks away.. . but it was probably a good mile plus from the Excalibur. And the stratosphere... was at least 3 miles out. The sidewalks force you to walk about double the distance sometimes, taking you up and over roads, instead of across sidewalks. I get the reasoning... (keeping traffic moving), but I thought i would mention it, as it added some time onto your walk now and then. (noteable more for reservations, etc). another thing we noticed was, the amount of people. everyone has alluded to the fact that vegas is hurting a bit... We did NOT see that. in the 5 days we were there - the sidewalks were jammed, stores were packed, and restaurants were filled. We needed resrevations for two out of the three 'nicer' restaurants we went to. The eiffel tower restaurant was EXCELLENT. a bit pricey. But the food, and service were superb. The restaurant on the ground floor of the eiffel tower - mon ami mambi (or something like that) was also really good, and a bit cheaper and more casual... but still very nice. we did a TON of walking and i THINK we saw most of the hot button attractions that most first timers would want to see. We walked a TON.. and used cabs, and the Deuce (bus). The deuce was a great value, easy to use, but slow at times - especially during rush hour. Back to the Excalibur... The casino was a bit more dated than others we saw (we must have entered into about 25+ other casinos!!!).. but it was good. It had everything you would need in my opinion, and the cocktail waitresses provided better service than i was anticpiating (except for one miserable one!)... The tables were always busy (a good sign), and the smoke level was average to fair. Being from CT, i would actually rate the air quality level in vegas casinos as being better than Connecticuts own Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun! We went to our Buffet once for dinner. And it was pretty good. no complaints, and there was more than enough food options to suit your needs. We all found something that we liked, and left stuffed... no surprises there! The Tournament of Kings show was also excellent... Dinner was provided (cornish game hens, brocolii, potatoe wedges, apple turnover, sodas)... And it was actually really good! We were surprised. It was definitely worth the price we paid (buy one, get one free). It was a blast. Much like Medieval Times, etc. The girls used the Spa at the Excalibur, and had nothing but great things to say. It was clean , efficient, and relaxing. The amount of shops, restaurants, etc in the Excalibur was also sufficient. It certainly was not an indoor mall - but had a handful of fast food restaurants, gift shops, and coffee shops. We did not eat at the formal restaurants at the Excalibur, so we can't comment on them. The pay bars on the casino floor were a bit pricey, and service was intermittent at best. I used a drink coupon (you get them on checkin), and it seemed to cost me more than if i didnt have them on one occasion... Oh well... Just say no thank you to any one in a suit and a name tag that approaches you... They are timeshare salesmen... Keep walking. Unless you want a timeshare that is. we expereinced this at a few hotels. We walked the pool area in the morning (right when the pool opened). At least one pool was heated, and the water was WARM. Not sure about he water slides, etc. That pool appeared closed. There was a small restaurant/bar at the pool, and the area had tons of private cabanas, with tv's, etc. it was an overcast day, and it was early... so only a handful of people were up there at the time. There was also a mid sized hottub at the pool area. The fitness center and spa were right off the pool area. A quick headsup - they charge you for gym usage here... But you do get a free one day fitness pass at checkin (along with a 20% off coupon for the spa, and two $5 off drink coupons)... not sure how long this coupon promo is on for.. Other points of interest - Stratoshpere - Worth the trip down... observation deck was cool, and so were the rides on the top! we lost our nerve a bit once we stepped out on the observation deck to board the tower ride... but we got it together! it was a good time. NY NY has a rollercoaster as well.. though not quite as intense, it got the job done, and gave our adrenaline levels a bit of a boost! The boys also made it to the Gun Store to fire off some full auto machine guns... We were both novices, and thought it would be fun... It was! it was pricey- but it was a great time! Dont forget to have the cab wait for you (its quick), or take down a cab #... We found oursevles walking back to the hotel... 4 miles. It was a nice easy walk though! Great weather! Cirque Du Soeil Love was EXCELLENT. None of us were huge Beatles fans or anything, but you will know the songs... Beatles or not - it was REALLY impressive. Small theater too... didnt appear to be any 'bad' seats in the house. The athleticism, choreography, and talent of these performers was incredible. I would see it again. There are SO many great places to eat... Each hotel seemed to have about 2 or 3 restaurants that were 'nice' and appeared worth trying. I could spend years in this city just eating at different places. Same goes for Clubs, if thats your thing. Made our way down to Freemont/Downtown area one day. This is 'old vegas' as many already know. It was nice to spend the day down there.. a bit different feel, and a bit more lowkey. Still a fair amount of things to do. Lots of shopping too... a long bus ride though... or at least it seemed like a long bus ride! If you check out Coyote Ugly at NY NY - be sure to get a free coupon from one of the 4 people handing things out in NY NY... its good for either free, or discounted admission.. saved our group $40 or so. (depending on what time you go). we checked it our for 20 min or so... watched them do their thing, and headed out. Its worth the stop... its probably worth staying a bit if you just turned 21! One final parting tip on LV... if you're used to hailing a cab as needed, be advised - its illegal for LV cabs to stop to pick you up. You either have to call a cab for pickup or get one at any hotel cab stop. They can't stop on the street. This is a bit different, as we venture to NYC often. Its apparently for the cab driver, and the passengers safety. We had a great and much better than anticipated time in vegas. It was definitely a better time than i ever thought it would be! The excalibur was a great hotel for the price.. You cannot beat it! I would get the widescreen room, and they were clean, and just 'felt' right. NOTHING fancy.. but definietly did the trick. Its not the nicest place on the strip - but lets you keep some of your $ for the 10,000 other things to do in LV. The location isnt central, but like i said - its still good in our opinion. Close to many things, and you're there to walk around anyways!! Again, the casino isnt new, but it was a casino.

Small compaints would be as follows: - Limited number of channels on the TV (though casinos want you to be gambling, not watching TV) - Rooms and hallways a little but musty, but not too bad. - Like many casinos, the line for the dinner buffet was ridiculous (over an hour). We passed on it and instead opted for the very pleasant and quiet Sherwood Forest Cafe (adjacent to the casino floor). - And, the breakfast buffet, though extensive, was of marginal quality - With respect to the buffets, be careful if you choose a higher room rate in return for a dining voucher (e.g., I had a choice between an $81 room, or $91 with a $25 food voucher); you may then feel obligated to use the voucher, which may mean a long wait in the buffet line unless you are able to go at a non-peak time.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHard Beds, Otherwise Okay\u201d", "Author": "iwanderafar", "ReviewID": "UR25213399", "Content": "I reserved the redone widescreen rooms because they advertised comfy \"pillow top\" mattresses.

The marble counter top in the bathroom is nice and there is plenty of seating, storage, and space to put your luggage. When we called about a light out and the safe not working they came right away and fixed everything. The rooms seem fairly clean. CONS: The bed is too hard and the linens have wrinkles in them that are so hard they'll wound you. There is no place to put your washcloth or scrubby in the bathroom and no place to put the shampoo. The bathroom is a shower only so no place to sit or shave your legs. For some reason they put the sink in about 5 inches from the front, so if you're short (I'm 5'4\") you need to lean on the cold marble to wash your face.

There was always a long line for any service, check in, check out, mail etc. My requests from reservations were not met (king bed, non smoking, next to my colleague I was traveling with) so we agreed to take two queens each to have adjacent rooms. I wish I would have taken pictures of the condition of my room to strengthen my review. There was hair all over the bathroom floor and other stains, there is also no tub but a shower stall (with a shower head with so much lime on it that it barely sprays out water.) There was actually blood and other mysterious stains on one of the beds as well as on the sheets of that bed. The other bed had more permanent type stains-like ink so I slept in that one. There are nice flat screen tv's on the wall but no HD tv- but still a nice touch. Every time the maid came into my room something happened. First time a dirty pillowcase was left on my suitcase, the next time a dirty cleaning towel was left on the floor, the third time the radio was left on very loud. I never complained about any of this to the hotel because I did not want the hassle and did not want my room moved. But when I checked out they tried to charge me a room upgrade fee that was $21/night and my colleague who was in the SAME exact room next door to me had no such charge. When I complained they reversed it but it just added to the pain of my experience at this hotel. They also do not have an airport shuttle, you had to pay $6.50 per person to get back to the airport. I advise people to hire a cab, if there is more than one person it will be cheaper and would not have stops at other hotels although \"Miss\" Diamond Bell made our trip interesting. Everything about this hotel is sub par for Vegas, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone, if I had any choice about where I stayed (our boss made the reservation and paid) I would have checked out and gone to another hotel after the first night. I would also not recommend this hotel to people with children. In the \"party pit\" several nights a week girls dance in bras and very small underwear very provocatively. This area is NOT in a bar, it is in the middle of the casino floor across from the reception area and the Sponge Bob statue meant for the kids to pose with. It was sad to watch very young little girls mimicking the dancers while their parents were in Dick's Last Resort-which actually has great drinks.

I booked via the hotel's website under their best rate guarantee and got an extremely cheap room over a v. bust weekend. TOP TIP use the website smartervegas or smartvegas dot com (can't exactly remember) which gives out the hotel promotion codes which use can then use to reduce the price at EX if you phone them up. We enjoyed our stay as we were upgraded (didn't ask) to a widescreen tower room which was very nice. Too be honest, people of our age range don't stay that long in the hotel room so it did the business as far as we were concerned. As far as location, I think it can't be beat. NY NY is right across the road which has great nightlife and MGM which is always buzzing. I don't think it really matters where you stay but the middle to south strip is the best. Gambling limits are also quite low at the EX and if you can't be bothered waiting for free drinks off the waitresses (which was quite slow), go to the bar and put $10 in the poker machine on the bar and your drinks will be free (much quicker for us anyway).

One benefit and down fall is that you have a great view of flights taking off day and night-but the sound might keep you up all night if you dont leave the fan on to damper the sound. We stayed on the twenth floor in tower 1 and the walk from car to room is exhausting after a day of walking etc. We were given two FREE drink vouchers and when we order our drinks-one liqour- we got charged an additional 8.00. For that I could have gambled then got a free drink and maybe better winnings. the ROOMS are clean and spacious-family friendly with a nice food court.

I loved the castle theme, and the ambiance. Everyone in this hotel seemed to be around my age (mid 20's), so there where lots of people to meet. But the BEST part of this hotel was the gambling. I lost a lot of money while I was in vegas, gambling at other hotels...and I made all of it back, and then some, on the slots at the excalibur and the NYNY. I love that I got a great room ina fun hotel for $40 a night....and that we had such a blast. The only thing that could be better is the security.

Trust me, leave little Billy and Sally in Missouri; you'll have more fun and so will we. 7. Timeshare Salesmen - What is unbelievable is the hotel places them right by the elevators that go to the guestrooms. 6. Hotel Setting - It seriously takes like 10 minutes to walk from your room to Las Vegas Blvd. Why can't we place the hotels closer to the street? 5. Timeshare Salesmen - You tell them that you are not interested 4 times, and they still approach you hoping the 5th time will be a charm. 4. Louie Anderson - Seriously??? 3. Timeshare Salesman - They also place them next to the front desk, this way you cannot even check in or out without running into them. 2. Five Dollar Resort Fee Per Night - This fee is basically to use the gym and phone. First, 95% of us are not using the gym on vacation and 2nd, 99% of us have cell phones. 1. Timeshare Salesman - Not only are these guys placed by the guest room elevators. Not only are these guys placed beside the check in, check out line.

This was our second trip to Vegas, and during our first trip we stayed at the Stratosphere on the very North end of the Strip. This time we decided to stay in the middle of the action, so we booked our stay at the Excalibur for $36/night for a standard non-smoking room with one king sized bed. I read the reviews and the complaints about the shabby rooms, etc., but for the amount of time we actually spend in the hotel room, it didn't influence our decision at all. Check in went very smoothly, and there was no wait at all. The front desk attendant was very friendly, and made small talk as she checked us in. The room itself was large and clean, and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was spotless, which was a big deal for me because a dirty/shabby bathroom is about the only pet peeve I have when staying at a hotel. We didn't have a room with a view facing the Strip but we didn't care, because the point is to be out on the Strip in the middle of it all instead of watching it from your hotel room! The housekeeping staff were very friendly, and we always came back to a freshly made room each afternoon. My fiance and I aren't ones to sit around the pool all day, but we did a walk through just to see what it was like. It was nice! There were cabanas poolside that people could reserve, plenty of chairs deckside, and a lot of room for children and adults alike. This hotel is not a luxury resort, so if you are expecting to be pampered or have a marble toilet I would check elsewhere. If you don't need frills and are just looking for a bargain room in a prime location to come back to at night to recharge for the next day, then this is your place! There were a lot of families with children staying at the Excalibur, mainly because it is one of the more kid-friendly choices on the Strip, if you can call Las Vegas \"kid-friendly\". They have an arcade, the Tournament of Kings Dinner Show, and the Midway, which has all sorts of little Las Vegas type souveneir shops and fast food options. So if you're looking for a place in Vegas to get away from kids for a while, this probably won't be the best option for you. We did eat at Dick's Last Resort, which is located in the Excalibur. It's a toned down version of the restaurant that is in Boston, but still not for the easily offended. The food was good though, typical pub type stuff. On a side note -this time around in Vegas we did want to see a Cirque du Soleil show, because they do have a number of different shows at a host of hotels on the Strip, and are always a hard ticket to get. Rather than go straight to the hotel box office to purchase the tickets, we decided to go to one of the half-priced ticket offices that are located on the strip. After all, half price beats full price! DON'T FALL FOR IT! What they should advertise is that you MAY get a ticket at half price, but you also may pay more than the actual box office price. Here's how it works: At the actual venue box office there are different ticket price ranges for each level of seat quality (orchestra, 1st mezzanine, 2nd mezzanine, etc). Each level has a price range in which tickets at the box office can be purchased......for example say the box office range for orchestra level tickets was $100-$200. The seats in the front of the orchestra level would be $200, and the seats in the back of the orchestra level would be $100. At the offices where the so-called half-priced tickets are sold , they'll offer all orchestra tickets at $150. You pay the money and they give you a voucher to take to the venue box office to redeem for your ticket to the show. At the box office you find that you're sitting in the back of the orchestra level. You just paid $150 for a $100 ticket at a half-priced ticket office. Not such a deal, is it? Long story short, at the half-priced ticket office my fiance and I ended up paying $80 extra to see Ka at the MGM Grand versus what the face value of the ticket when purchased at the MGM Grand box office. The show was amazing but I was definitely frustrated about getting hosed on the ticket price. Just do yourselves a favor and check the box office prices before going to the half-priced ticket office! You'll also have a say in where you sit if you purchase from the box office - they'll ask how close or far away you would like to be.

The room was a smoking room, but thanks to a previous writer I brought odor neutralizer which I sprinkled 2-3 times and then never smelled old smoke again. Walkways or trams to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand and NYNY. Tip: We had tickets to see Penn & Teller at the Rio, with 2 hours to kill we took a walk down the strip to see the Bellagio water show (every 15 minutes). When we made it there, popped across the street to the Paris, and hubby saw the sign for free van to the Rio. Saved ourselves $15 on cab fare. Cab lines can be long. When returning to the airport Sunday morning, other hotels had lines of cabs waiting to be called, but at Excalibur one appeared about every 30 seconds, I think because the drive is so short, cabbies figure why not pick up passengers on the other end of the strip where they can get a $20 or $25 ride. Breakfast buffets are about the same price regardless of the lavishness of the hotel, so may as well use breakfast for entertainment. Wonderful amount of food choices for $12 each at Excalibur, but a bit underflavored for me. Since I have to have my Eggs Benedict when I travel, one day we took the tram to Mandalay Bay for a sit-down (not buffet), which was about the same price and I was just as full. It overlooked a wonderful tropical courtyard. Temps in the 40's but sitting there in the sun looking at that view, could have been Cancun. Another day we took in the buffet at MGM Grand. About $2 more, I liked the blintzes and sausages better. Also had chef-carved meats. If you're into the TV screen-sports betting thing, the viewing seats at the Excalibur are much better than the ones at MGM, Luxor or NYNY, comfy leather ones with cup holders. If you have kids, be at the MGM Grand either 11 am or 4:30 pm on the button to see the lions come in. They rotate lions from a park and when the shift's 2 lions come in they're all curious and exploring. It's neat to have a huge male lion snuffling the glass & putting his paws there while teenage girls squeal and snap cell phone photos from a foot away.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBetter than i had expected!\u201d", "Author": "angelbabiie", "ReviewID": "UR23505862", "Content": "My rating is a 3.1/2 stars.

We had a tower room - the standard two queen/TV/shower configuration. It was perfect for me and my two kids, and all the fun you could want. There\u2019s a food court (McDonalds, Ice Cream bar, Subs, Quick Wok style Chinese, etc.) for the budget conscious, the buffet for the hungry ones, as well as other restaurants, but the best has to be Dirty Dicks restaurant downstairs near the lobby.. I took my kids there and we loved it. In Vegas, you can get a meal for three (including wine/beer) just about anywhere for $50, but the entertainment value of the people that work at \u2018Dicks\u2019 was worth double that. We ate, drank, and tipped well, and I hope it was enough. Everyone gets a hat, and they are legendary! They\u2019re made from a roll of white butchers paper with insults written on them. They look like chef hats at a distance, but when you get closer to the victim, you see the sting. A couple of days before we\u2019d been moving through the casino and passed a girl with something written on hers I had trouble explaining to my kids! They toned down theirs when we were there of course, but I daren\u2019t tell you what they wrote on mine (after the kids had gone to bed) The only downside to Dicks is its vicinity to the pole dancing area which my children found a little oppressive. Not really the sort of thing for a family holiday, but hey, Vegas is Vegas. A word about smoking. The Nevada clean air act, means that you can eat smoke-free anywhere in Vegas, although smoking is allowed in the casinos. Now I hate smoke, but didn\u2019t find any of the casinos oppressive in anyway, and the restaurants are fine for us non-smokers. America seems to be finally losing its love for tobacco, and very few people seemed to be smoking anywhere. I have to say the system there is preferable to the UK where you have to fight to get in through sad little groups of smokers freezing outside bars and restaurants everywhere. My daughter is a Sponge Bob fan, and so we went downstairs to the ride there. It\u2019s actually one of those video screen flight simulator style rides (similar to the Star Wars one at Disney) and the price structure makes it attractive to go for all three rides (Sponge Bob, a Log run and an Earthquake adventure) It was run by two harassed and overworked girls who yelled and waved at a distance while running from room to room. Their problem was some folks had bought one ride and others like us bought two or more, and we were all mixed in together so they were trying to weed out people while feeding in others. Not a satisfactory experience, and I\u2019d advise avoiding it unless you\u2019re a real addict to that sort of thing. The other thing to avoid is the rather tacky \u2018play area\u2019 It seems to be designed as somewhere to dump the kids while you hit the tables. I\u2019ve been there and done it as regards gambling so didn\u2019t need to offload my two. The whole thing is a cheap flim flam stall with various machines spitting out yards of tickets that you exchange for goods. Trouble is you need ten thousand of them to get anything worthwhile, and everything my son got broke within minutes. We ate breakfast on the last day at the Buffet. It\u2019s fine and very American, so remember whatever the advertised prices add on sales tax and gratuity and figure on at least $10 each. But of course, for that you eat as much as you want and from a huge range. The down side is you\u2019re milling around with thousands of others all looking for things that no-one can locate as the food is spread over an area the size of a tennis court. Again slightly understaffed. All in all though I thought it was a good hotel. I\u2019ve previously stayed at the Hilton, (most of my LV trips have been conventions) Bally\u2019s, and The Luxor, as well as out of town motels and I cannot fault the Excalibur with respect to any of them. It's a budget hotel and has to be seen in that context, but it exceeded my expectations. If I'm pushed to speak of a gripe it was that they closed the main pool leaving only two smaller ones for everyone. Granted we were at the end of the season, but there were still a lot of people there and the two remaining pools were crowded and to be honest, not what I would call sparkling clean.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcalibur - Loved the Roulette\u201d", "Author": "silvesy", "ReviewID": "UR23385244", "Content": "The Hotel was good.

The room was clean, had good storage, but not enough coat hangers and the king bed was great. The renovation was good in the main room and the wide screen TV a bonus. The only let down was the bathroom. It had been updated, but the wall paper was dirty and the paint job was a little hit and miss. The shower had hairs in it, which we had to remove as after a day they were still there\u2026and were not ours! The bathroom door also didn\u2019t close, but this was a minor issue. A few little points the IPod doc, is in fact a cable coming out of the alarm clock, so wont charge your IPod\u2026sound quality not that great either! The hair dryer is OK, but wired into the bathroom so you can only use it in there which is a bit of a pain. All in all our room was good, and maybe the down sides were cleaning related.

The facilities at the hotel are good, the buffet is OK, but there are so many good places to eat, don\u2019t waste your time with buffets.

Taxi ride from airport to the hotel was only 15mins and cost $15, which was cheaper than getting the shuttle bus and more convenient. Check-in was quick and easy, you have to go to the very back of the casino to check in. It does mean walking through the casino with your suitcases. What I would say is be polite to the receptionist as it can pay off. We received a room with a strip view at no extra charge. Our room overlooked the roller coaster at New York New York. Our room, 25233, in Tower 2 was very spacious, had a huge flat screen TV, 2 queen sized beds, great size bathroom with shower, no bath. The rooms were serviced every day. No tea and coffee facility but there was room service available. There is an ice machine at the end of each hall next to a soft drink vending machine.

Perhaps I'll start with the main message of this review: Would I stay at the Excalibur again or recommend it to friends? NO! Here is why. Granted some good things about the property included, we were able to check in early (arrived about noon) and we were booked into the newly renovated widescreen tv rooms which I believe was an upgrade for us. The big problem I had with this property was that there were obvious signs the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned prior to our check in. In one of the bathrooms tell tale signs of a rush clean included the fact that the toilet had not been flushed and evidence was still left in the toilet that housekeeping did not bother to clean it. Another sign of a hasty cleanup was the fact that the previous occupant had lost one her false eye lashes in the sink as it was still found adhered to the side when we went to wash our hands for the first time. EWW! For the price (as this hotel is one of the more economical on the strip) I realize I can't expect too much but basic housekeeping should be included in the price. As mentioned in other reviews one of our rooms also had mysterious stains on the curtains and outside bedding. Other problems encountered were: our shower did not drain properly, one of the sliding doors was coming off the track and and in one room the bathroom wall mirror had come off the wall and was left on the side of the counter when we arrived. I know the above review may sound like a lot of complaining but there are some points to ponder when you are choosing a place to stay. I have stayed in other Vegas hotels on the strip and enjoyed both the Monte Carlo and Luxor (in order of preference) and would stay at either again but not the Excalibur. Despite the accomodations we had another enjoyable stay in Vegas.

Not only is this property still 'kid-friendly', but the price of the room was amazing. Yes, I know it's slow in Vegas this time of year but the Excalibur was easily the cheapest of all the Strip casino properties. We had an early check-in around 1 pm Sunday afternoon with absolutely no wait. Front desk was very friendly and efficient. I had opted not to pay for the room upgrade (flat screen TV, renos, etc.) but the room we had was just fine. Great view (though not of the Strip), clean, and pretty spacious. Perhaps some of the drawbacks of these 'older' rooms, however, are the fairly low (and somewhat uncomfortable) beds, as well as a lack of an in-room safe or coffee maker. Still, given the price we were more than happy. Because it was a Sunday, in December, and during an economic downturn, the hotel/casino was extremely quiet. I have stayed here before and know that elevators don't usually show up - empty - and seconds after the button is pushed. No complaints in that department. It was interesting to note that while we were staying in mid-December, apparently the outdoor pool was still heated and open! Also, the buffet was running a 2 for 1 special until 6 pm so the price/value was very good indeed. The line up for this was maybe 45 minutes but given the savings I certainly didn't have a problem with that. The food selection and quality was really quite good.

After a nights sleep on the most uncomfortable bed, we went on about our day which really went off without a hitch we won like 400 dollars at a craps table that was nice and little did we know needed. So we stayed out till about 4:30 and then decided to head back to our hotel room and we had to get one taxi to take us to the first monorail stop which was a ways away within the first few blocks we noticed everything was blocked off literally we managed to get to the monorail stop just to realize that it closed at 3 am our fault. So we went to the nearest hotel lobby to catch a charter bus only to find out that they weren't running and very few taxis would take people to the strip because everything was blocked off they told us we would probably have to walk all 20 plus mile back to our hotel cause they were blocking off all the roads for a marathon in like an hour, some thing you thingk the hotel would tell us upon check in that road were going to be closed down. We found a taxi to take use luckily that cost us about 30 dollars only to get to out hotel just in time to for the marathon to start which was accompanied by a couple hundred if not thousand dollars of fireworks being lit off only a block away for like 20 plus minutes.

The woman who helped us got us a deal to stay in one of the jacuzzi rooms. She went out of her way to make phone calls to get us the deal. She answered all our questions and was friendly. When we walked towards our tower, we were immediately approached by the timeshare folks - they seem to scan the crowd for couples. Another reviewer suggested splitting up as you walk past them and that worked very well. Room was comfortable. My husband complained that the mattress was a little hard, but it was fine. Large bathroom with shower and plenty of counter space. Took advantage of the jacuzzi tub 4 out of the 5 days that we were there.

They told us to check in together, so our rooms would be close together. Well, they changed to a smoking room and didn't have a problem, we were told we would have to pay an extra $10 a night for our reserved non-smoking, king size bed. They would not budge, so we took a double bed room, as I figured we wouldn't be there much. Bathroom was nice, large and clean. In my brother's room, the windows were open.

They were very helpful and were able to put our group in 3 of the wide screen rooms next to each other.

One thing that I couldn't resist doing was asking for a Bloody Caesar at the bar, which is Clamato juice and Vodka (similar to a Bloody Mary). The bartenders usually don't know what I'm asking for, but the one we asked did and made a decent one. We only had one meal in the Hotel and it was the breakfast buffet, which was at best average, but definitely a lot better than we had at the Imperial Palace a while back.

After seeing the hotel/casino during prior trips to Vegas we had a good idea on what to expect -- sort of a mish-mosh of Las Vegas and Disneyworld atmospheres with a dash of glitz and glamor. The room was nice. We didn't bother updating to one of the more modern (Flatscreen TV) rooms. Aside from a stain on the carpet the room was clean and odor-free and more spacious than we anticipated. Even the bathroom was nice, although those expecting a \"suite\" or \"spa\" style bathroom will be disappointed. The ease of making it from your room to the Vegas Strip was not that great. It took on average at least a good five minutes to make it from our elevator, downstairs, through the casino and over the seemingly half-mile-long series of people movers and walkways until we could get to the foot of the bridge to the Tropicana, the bridge to NY/NY or the tram to Mandalay Bay. And that not counting the countless times we had to walk past the rude, obnoxious and unneccessary \"Would you like a free gift!?\" timeshare salespeople stations both INSIDE and outside of virtually every entrance/exit from the hotel. The Bellagio doesn't have this. MGM Grand doest have this. Caesar's doesn't have this. And you know why? Because they're all a class above the Excalibur. It's bad enough we had to endure these time-share sharks more often than the migrant Porn-etta workers who try to hand out cards/flyers along the Strip for various \"adult\" services. The abrasive and often annoying timeshare salespeople who wound many times block your path to give you a hard sales pitch would ask us every single time we passed them in the hotel if we wanted \"free gifts\" or if we were staying in the hotel or if we were planning to see any shows. Even if the same person just asked us five minutes prior. The Excalibur really needs to boot these people from their premises if they expect to get any return business. The eateries in the hotel, with the exception of \"Dick's Last Resort\" were abysmal. I know from past visits that the steakhouse and the Italian restaurant (Regale) are no better than your average Outback or Olive Garden on a good day. This time we decided to give the Buffet a go, figuring how bad could it be to mess up breakfast. Well, everything was cold. Not warm or lukewarm...COLD. You're much better off taking the tram to Mandalay Bay. I wouldn't recommend eating anywhere inside of the Excalibur except for Dick's which was pretty entertaining, had good food and good sized portions. The bars/lounges in the Excalibur casino were sub-par. The entertainment at \"The Lounge\" was about what you could expect but the service from the waitress was beyond bad. After ordering a beer and a soda for my wife and I we got our drinks about fifteen minutes later and gave the server a $3 tip. We were then ignored and visibly passed-by for the next forty five minutes. At one point the waitress actually went to every table around us taking orders then turned her back on us as she took the empty bottle from our table. I had to go to the bar to order another round and then brought it back to my own table. Not even that act got attention from the waitress. We left out of frustration and went to another casino instead. The Wedding Chapel was nice (we renewed our vows) and relatively affordable. As for entertainment in the hotel, unless you think Louie Anderson is funny or want to see half naked Australian men, there's not much there for you. Finally, I attended the Tournament of Kings dinner show back in 2003 and then again in 2005. It was the same show both times. We were advised that nothing in the show had changed even by 2008 so we passed on it this time around. It would behoove the owners of the casino and the folks behind the Tournament of Kings to maybe think about changing up the storyline a bit year after year to keep people coming to the show. Otherwise it's a one and done type of thing. The new pool was nice. Too bad it was never open. I can't understand why they would advertise this new attraction and then not allow anyone to use it. I was pleased to see an \"adult only\" pool area, which meant those who were at the hotel without children could have their own pool and sunbathing area without having to worry about screaming, splashing and everything else that comes with a \"family friendly\" pool. Check-in and check-out were easy. Maid service was great! And again, that brings me back to why I said that the Excalibur is a great place to sleep but everything else leaves a lot to be desired.

During our conversations we were told that the lost items were not the hotels responsibility and most employees have worked there for a long time so it wasn\u2019t like someone would get fired over this (Which we thought was a strange thing to say). Honestly we just want our shoes back, they were expensive, we liked them and we just bought them. We weren\u2019t looking for someone to get in trouble, we just wanted our shoes back. The only person that could have been there after we left was the housekeeper and they missed a large white box? That is unbelievable.

Check in is centrally located in the casino floor and you would have to be blind to miss it!

We can't expec t to get everything all the time, life isn't like that! Also attitude, tone and a friendly approach at the hotel check-in get you a long way, especially if checking in during the week. My partner and I checked in mid-week and i had upon reserving the room contacted the hotel via email and POLITELY ASKED if it would be possible to be allocated a room on a high floor, i recieved a response within 24 hours saying our request had been noted but could not be guaranteed. At check-in we were served by a very friendly jolly member of staff by the name of Michael, he found our reservation and noted the email we sent, he said he will see what he could find, well did he find a room or did he find a rrom, we were allocated a kingsize room on the 27th floor with a strip view, amazing! room 27217 The room was huge with pillow-top matress bed that you could have slept 4 people in comfortably, a hdtv, a huge shower stall, The only downside is the rooms do not come equipped with fridges and if you do want to hire a fridge it is a steeply priced $20 a night, even if like myself you needed a fridge for medical reasons in my case needing to keep my insulin cold. There doesn't appear to be any leway on this, however the room does have ice buckets and ice machines located on all floors.

We get to see the fountains at the Bellagio. The kids loved it. But we forgot it was Saturday night in Las Vegas, so many scantily clad ladies and drunks on the street. My son thinks everyone in Las Vegas are perverts because of all the pictures of girls. Day 5-Had a great night sleep. WE headed to circus circus and to the Adventuredome. The kids enjoyed the rides. Get the coupon in the back of all the cabs, for $5 off the bracelets. For $20 the kids rode rides for several hours. We saw the very brief clown show. We gave the kids $10 for the games, it lasted them over an hour, next time I would give less. WE grabbed a cab to the Venetian. The kids thought the lobby of the hotel was really cool. They were impressed with mall too. We did some shopping. WE saw the statues and the opera show at Saint Marks square. From there we walked to Paris Paris, which was cool. From there we went to Planet Hollywood (PH) casino. I thought it would have Hollywood stuff like the restaurants. It was cool looking, but not what I expected. Headed to the Showcase Mall, which is not a mall, but a few stores next to each other. The coke store was interesting. The kids loved the M&M store, it went on for many floors. We went and saw the lion exhibit at the MGM. It was so cool, the trainer was there. The lion walked over us while we were in the glass tunnel. Then the trainer threw meat on the window and the lion would like it off, like he was licking you. It was so cool. After this we were exhausted went back to the hotel to briefly rest. Then off to the Luxor to see Believe. We went to the Criss Angel Store. We went into try the elevators at the Luxor, they tip. You need to sneak on with someone with a room key or they won\u2019t work. From there we headed to the show. Get there early, you have to check your phone & camera and go thru metal detectors. Also I bought and printed my tickets from Ticketmaster, and I had to still go to the box-office to exchange them for their tickets. The kids loved the show. I thought it was bizarre. After the show we walked to Mandalay Bay. You can walk from Excalibur to the Luxor and to Mandalay without going outside. We went to the restaurant Aureole to see the wine steward. It was neat watching her go up and down a pulley system to get the wine. From there we headed to the shark aquarium. It was so cool. It was overpriced but it was very informative and neat. You can touch stingrays. You end at a \u201csunken ship\u201d. You are surrounded by water and the fish, sharks and sea turtles are swimming all around you. We really enjoyed it. Day 5- We headed to the Tropicana to see the Titanic exhibit. They give you a boarding pass with the information of a real passenger. Then you go thru the exhibit learning about the boat and the various passengers. There is even an \"real\" iceberg. At the end you see if your passenger survived.

All of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful throughout our stay as well and we found it easy to navigate this hotel compared with others we visited (many of which were quite easy to get lost in!). As the hotel is right at the end of the strip, you can easily work your way down visiting each of the hotels on foot and then just get a cab back at the end of the day if you\u2019re too tired to walk all the way. With the Luxor hotel, etc all so close, you can have a change of scene even without venturing too far, especially as the hotels are all linked with integral walkways and escalators. At the Excalibur there are a range of places to eat but we did have meals at other hotels too since they are all so accessible. Given that we had the convenience of the whole Las Vegas strip right on our doorstep, the price we paid was pretty satisfying. We were able to explore the other hotels without having to pay the premium for staying there ourselves. Of course, if you want the prestige and added luxury that probably comes with staying at Ceasar\u2019s Palace, Paris, Bellagio etc then I\u2019m sure you\u2019d probably get value for the extra money you\u2019d have to spend. However, staying at Excalibur is not a second rate option given the excellent rooms, service and facilities you have. I\u2019d highly recommend it for anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Las Vegas with access to all the highlights for an incredibly good price. One extra point, our trip to the grand canyon was through a coach tour company which picked us up and dropped us off right outside the hotel. A tip on this, we went on the south rim tour (widest, deepest part of the canyon, further from Vegas) but on reflection, we should probably have taken the west rim tour. The west rim is a lot closer to Vegas hence you can get there and back before 6pm plus there are more activities at the west rim and visitor attractions like the glass skywalk that hangs over the edge of the canyon.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for location and \"buzz\"\u201d", "Author": "k9david", "ReviewID": "UR20847421", "Content": "Our second time at the Excalibur and i must admit i love the place.

I went for a mother daughter week. We arrived late sunday night and Emily at front desk bumped us up to their new updated rooms in tower two. she was awesome for this. The bed was a little hard but i like extreamly soft beds. however my mom loved the bed and i know if other members of my family came would have loved them too. Ive read some people complain about the tv lacking but it was sufficent for how often you are really in the room considering there is so much to do. its basic tv stations. There is no wireless internet for the hotel. It is $12.99 for a 24 hour period of time so be prepaired if you need to use it. My laptop was picking up something wireless but i wasn't going to trust it because if you try and pick up something you will understand from the names why i didn't trust the connections. I was on the 16th floor in tower two and i didn't smell any smoke being in a none smoking room. having asthma i thought this might have been an issue considering other people said they did but i assume if u get a room thats high enough up u shouldn't have a problem. front desk asked if we wanted and upper or lower room and we choose upper and i think it was the better choice. It was a clean room, the bathroom has a big couter top. i enjoyed the shower its big but theres no bathtub so some people might be upset by this but we didn't care. we didn't gamble the whole time we were there but we managed to see a couple shows and did lots of sight seeing. so i can't really tell ya anything about the casino it self other then it being big is loud haha.. Now i saw someone Questioning Why the pool water had a salt taste... Its A Salt Water Pool..... I loved it but some wonder why and so i thought i would inform. i heard that salt water pools need less chemicals to keep clean and thus better for use. Pools were warm. but thats obviously because of the daily heat. The hot tubs were awesome. But the pool is only opened from 9am-6pm ... most the hotels are like this but some have better pool hours but not by much from what i did notice. every morning we ate at the sherwood forest cafe. it was excellent. and service was great. because it was just my mother and I so we didn't wait in line in the morning for breakfast. if there was a spot at the bar u can seat urself and service is much faster then at the tables. i think u spend maybe 30 minutes at the bar thats from arriving at your seat to finishing your breakfast.. and for the two of us it cost around $30 with ur tip. if u go into the casino theres an escalitor that goes to the second floor where there is fast food like mcdonalds (24/7 a day) pizza hut, quiznos subs, krispy kreams if u got kids this is a good place. theres couple resturants there too. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel except when we went to the tournament of the kings but thats a dinner show and so it doesn't really count. we ate dinner at the other hotels, rainforest cafe in MGM and at treasure island theres a resturant by the cirque de soile theater (resturant bar) and that place was really good i just can't remember the name. it was a weird name. Tournement of the kings is a fun show and dinner. If you have been to Midevil times then you will know the basic concept of this show. The dinner was excellent. Some people dont realise you eat with your hands and not forks and knives so if u have kids they might really like this. just bring hand sanitizer with you. some of those \"kings\"were really good looking too which is always appealing to go see just because hahaha. the hotel is about a 15 minute drive to the airport. if u have a late night flight the hotel will lock your luggage for the day. The late check out is at 3 and its an extra $40 for this option. If you want to see something really cute go to the Dolphin Exibit/Secret Garden in The Mirage. there is a brand new baby swimming around with her mother. she only about 4 weeks old right now and soo adorable M&M world is back to being 4 floors for all those who heard the top floor was closed down for a while. But all are back and full for M&M goodness. A little hint for those who have never went to vegas. If you are going to be walking the strip and need to use the restroom never go into fast food place the hotels along the strip are kept MUCH cleaner because they have to live up to the expectations of the guests but the quick stops along the way that are not owned by a hotel do not need to live up to much. i think that might be all i need to say. hope it was detailed enough for you to help u make a decision.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, GA", "Title": "\u201cTale of Two Hotels\u201d", "Author": "jsle", "ReviewID": "UR20365782", "Content": "This hotel has a split personality.

I did tip the front desk to receive a better room and was given a newly renovated, king bed with a view of the strip. Room appeared ok, big screen TV, king bed, table with a chair and another \"lazy\" boy type chair. Bathroom was pretty nice with granite counter top and large shower. Bathroom amenities were pretty sparse with the small bottle of conditioning shampoo, lotion and small soaps. A light bulb was burned out in the bathroom making it pretty dark. I called housekeeping and they said they would send someone up to replace the bulb. I unpacked and waited roughly an hour but no one showed. Sink in the bathroom did not drain very quickly either. That night I discovered the king bed had been short sheeted and the sheets moved up to where I was basically sleeping on a bare mattress...no mattress pad either - ick! Also, the A/C unit was very loud coming on and off along with a very noisy room where you could easily hear traffic and sirens during the night. The pillows were the size of postage stamps so needless to say, the next day I was tired. I did leave the maid a tip and requested she correct the sheets along with please having the light bulb in the bathroom replaced. Came back to the room that night and the light bulb was laying in the bathroom but no bulb had been placed in the socket so now I just had a light with no bulb. Bed sheets were the same as the day before.....short and uncomfortable to sleep on. I stayed at the hotel for five nights since I was working a trade show nearby and never was the light bulb replaced. I finally took a bulb out of a lamp in the bedroom so I could see in the bathroom. Sheets were never corrected....not sure why they would have king beds with not having king sheets!!! There was a glass and a beer bottle in the hallway all week until the day I left the hotel. Hotel is located ok near the south end of the strip but walkable to other hotels along with tram availability. Not sure what they are thinking with the \"go go\" girls dancing on the gaming tables in the \"party pit\" but since it is Vegas....guess anything goes.

After reading some reviews here, I had some concerns about how this would go. The concerns never materialized. Checked in on a Thursday night about 8PM. Probably a 3-4 minute wait. I was given a choice of 2 queens or a king room. Asked for a king, they offered to upgrade it to a tower 2 room, though it was a \"handicapped\" room. No extra charge was asked for. I think the only downside of that is that the bathroom sink area was smaller to accommodate wheelchairs. I have no idea why I was given Tower 2. I got the room in a package with Allegiant Air. I tried to be extra friendly upon check in, but didn't even ask for anything. Also got an ok view. I was on the 7th floor facing NYNY (north). Nice room, could have been a little cleaner, but acceptable. Certainly heard street noise at all hours, but it is Vegas, the 24 hour city, no need to get POed about that. As a newbie, I learned the Tower 1/Tower 2 thing. When looking at pictures, I see 4 \"towers\". Well Tower 1 is the east and south \"towers\". It is actually one tower as it is joined in the middle by the elevators, and connecting walkways. Tower 2 is the west and north \"towers\". I parked in the ramp to the west. It is kinda of a long walk to the front desk to check in, tho despite what some have wrote here, I thought the signage to find the registration was decent. If you park out back, and if you have never been here, I would highly recommend just walking in without your luggage to check in. Scope out the lay of the land so to speak. Overall you will walk further, but it will cutdown on the distance you need to tote your luggage because the distance to the tower elevators will be shorter. Think of check in this way-assuming you park out back. You park in Los Angeles, and Washington DC is where you check in. Your elevator will either be in Chicago (Tower 2) or New Orleans (Tower 1). So in my case, the choice would be to drag luggage from LA to DC and back to Chicago. Or walk from LA to DC, walk back to LA, then get your luggage and bring it to Chicago. I guess that is the call you need to make on your own, depending how bulky/heavy your luggage is. Speaking of elevators, when I first saw them, I thought there would be long lines to use the elevators. I was always able to get on the first car. Another nice thing is they have elevators for floors 2-17, and then for 18 and up. So the people on the higher floors don't need to stop all the way up, nice for them. I was surprised by the pleasantness of the staff at this hotel. I kinda figured I would get the surly/indifferent service worker attitude, but everybody I dealt with was pleasant. As for the time share people, I had no issue whatsoever. I saw a couple of them, and most times never even had contact with them. I think I was asked about shows twice, and I gave a quick no thanks, and that was the end of it. Went to the breakfast buffet twice. Pretty decent place for a buffet. Good selection. Very friendly staff. Went to the Tournament of Kings. I love that stuff, and it didn't disappoint. I thought the food was pretty good for a mass production delivery. The chicken was spiced nicely and was moist. Drink service was great. Couple refills on water and Pepsi, and available servers for alcohol drinks. Went to Sponge Bob 3D. Lotsa fun.

We stayed at the Imperial Palace last time, so this time we thought we would try staying somewhere new. We chose the Excalibur Hotel which is towards the airport side of the strip. Our main reasons for choosing the Excalibur were the price ( typical 3* hotel ), the updated/remodelled rooms and the pool scene. To start with, the hotel itself was quite nice. The casino is a good size and the layout is not like the mazes that most hotels offer. We were put in tower 2, which appears to be the one that is completely renovated so far. We were put in the last room of a long corridor. The walk to our room from the elevator was a pain, but there was no noise down there. In fact, speaking about noise, the room we had was so sound proof, we were both amazed. It was like no one else was staying there. In short, nice room ( if typical except for the plasma t.v.), typical lousy view ( the interior roof tops and so on ). You get a 50/50 chance of having a view. We did not arrive until 11:00pm so i assume we got last choice. We only ate at one of the true restaurants at the Excalibur. It was the Italian restaurant. To be blunt, the food was okay but the service was awful. We waited a while to be served. When our waiter showed up, he took our orders, without any chit chat or smiles, and quickly left. It would have been nice if he stayed long enough to ask for our drinks!!! Unfortunately the food did not make up for the service. Lesson learned. We chose to eat elsewhere the rest of the week. RESTAURANT TIP - Try the Cheesecake Factory at Caeser's Palace. There must be 10 pages of items, including 32 types of cheesecake for dessert. It was one of the best meals we had for under $50 and the food was great and plentiful. The pool area is what we most liked about this hotel. While the main pool was out service, ( low season, so we were told ) the other two pools were packed but there were always lots of chairs. We chose to stay at the adult's only pool all week. They have a good pool drink service, so you never have to get up. We chose to buy our own beer/coolers the night before and brought a cooler bag with us. Does it sound like we are cheap? You save money where you can in Las Vegas so you can see all of the great shows. Only complaint about the pool area, is that it needs to be maintained a little better. Some mornings when we arrived at opening ( 9:00am ), there were some things floating in the pool that should have been cleaned before guests arrived. In general, things to do at this hotel. Do rent a car and travel to the Hoover Dam and the Red Rock Canyon. You can travel to both places and be back in 6 hours. If you have the time, drive up to the Grand Canyon ( full day trip ). Our cost for the rental and gas inclusive was only $70.00. We declined the insurance as we had our own. We were given a P.T. Cruiser as a compact car. At night, check out the lounge at the Excalibur. They have good bands playing every night for free. In closing, we did enjoy our time at the Excalibur. It served it's purpose and was clean. The price was definitely right. Would we stay here again? Probably, but we like to try different hotels. If we were to visit again, we would probably go a little more upscale and stay in the heart of the strip. P.S. BEWARE THE TIMESHARE PEOPLE!!!

NO COFFEEPOT in room-had to buy at crowded McDonalds or Starbucks for $3-$4 a cup! $8 steak after 11PM at Sherwood Cafe was worth the money. Food court with McDonalds,Quiznos, Cold Stone, upstairs. Can get bus on other side of MGM($5 for 24 hr ticket) if you can't walk far, or want to check out downtown.. Excalibur is at the South end of strip, but if you like to walk, pedestrian walkways make it easy to walk down the strip and see majority of the casinos. 4 pools, only 2 open when we were there. One complaint-entire pool area only open from 9am to 6 pm! I like to read paper and drink coffee at the pool, but cannot enter until 9am, even if not swimming!", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galesburg, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cloved the castle\u201d", "Author": "preciouspongo", "ReviewID": "UR20212303", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in June.

Hidden safe was in the drawer chest. Full bathroom amenities. No coffee maker. Handy personal swing arm mirror came in handy. Problems: there is a missing towel bar on the shower door , the sliding closet doors get jammed when open fully (the slides are out of alignment) and the shower drain was very slow at first, almost filling to overflow if I hadn't cut my shower time. Maintenance did fix it after I called. Over all it was a good stay this time. The offer I received included three nights in a room with a widescreen tv, $100 free slot play, and $50 food credit for each day of my stay, but I only received $25 food credit. so I mostly ate out at other casino properties and played there more.

We had a great view of the NY NY and MGM hotels. The room definitely should qualify above a 3-star rating. The bathroom was large, and the shower was just fine. The bed was absolutely huge (CA King), and quite comfortable. Being August, the temperature outside was well into the 100's, but the AC worked wonderfully and the temperature in the room was comfortable at all times. I felt very secure in the room, as the door deadbolts by turning the handle upward. The casino was fine, didn't win, but didn't lose much either. The nice thing about the casino is the ease in navigating it. Many casinos in Vegas are huge with little signage, but I found it easy to navigate, and not too smokey. The access to Luxor and NY NY is also very convenient. My girlfriend got a Swedish massage at the spa and loved every minute of it.

The water was salty but I believe that is a necessity in Las Vegas. The food was mediocre at best. However, all the food in Las Vegas isn't that great.

This is a great hotel. It is NOT overrun with kids. I saw more kids at MGM than at the Excalibur. It has an absolutely wonderful pool area. (four different pools!) with a live band every day between 4 pm - 8 pm. A slushy alcoholic drink cost $9 by the pool. Beers were $7 (I believe). Breakfast at the Sherwood Forest Cafe was excellent and my service was NOT unusually slow - as others have mentioned. Late lunch at the buffet was also great. It's not going to win any fancy foodie awards but it is, indeed, good food. There is absolutely no reason, in my opinion, to avoid the buffet. In fact, if we had tried the buffet earlier in our trip, we would have visited the buffet more than just one time. Our room was cleaned very efficiently every day. We had more than enough space for two people. We were in a deluxe tower II room on floor 17 which was especially great because it was just a short walk from our room to the pool. We never had any issues finding two lounge chairs together by the pool and we were never down there early in the morning. The water was wonderfully refreshing. There is a small 4 foot (?) waterfall in one of the pools that had just enough pressure to release the knots in my neck. It was a very nice addition to the pool area. The largest pool has a seat ledge built in that is nice for sitting on while in the water. We spent a lot of our time enjoying this simple feature. We listened to a great band in one of the lounges on our last night there. They were awesome. The place was packed by the time we had to leave. I'm not a big gambler but I was able to enjoy 2 1/2 hours of slot play on just $20 in the Excalibur casino. I was very surprised, but happy, with that. NY NY is just a short walk away. We spent some time at the ESPN Zone. I found the cheapest mixed drinks there. I got a double shot of captain morgan with diet coke for just $8. If anyone has any questions about Excalibur, please do not hesitate to ask me. This is a great hotel. EXCELLENT value.

We normally stay down town at the Golden Nugget and had booked two additional nights there. We chose the Excalibur because according to the their website they have newly remodeled rooms with pillowtop mattresses and plasma TVs. Our room was overlooking the pool in Tower II. Yes, the rooms have been updated- granite counter tops in bathrooms (though shower was not updated) and over a/c unit. The beds DO have a pillowtop mattress but NO box springs. The mattress sits on top of a board. We all woke the first morning with a back ache. After that we made sure we did a lot of walking in the evening so that we would be so worn out we could sleep on the rock hard mattress. The buffet was horrible. Sherwood Cafe was good. Kids had fun at the pools and arcade. There is a free monorail to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. FYI- If you use the valet when checking in , the bellhop who loads your luggage onto the cart and moves it 20 feet to the holding area expects a tip and advised us that they are tipped separately from the bellhop that will eventually bring your luggage to the room. We brought this to the manager's attention when checking out. There is self parking near Tower II and we took care of our own luggage when leaving. Good location- near MGM, NY NY, Monte Carlo. We walked to the Belagio and Paris at night once it cooled down but beware there are a lot of people handing out cards advertising GIRLS. We kept trying to distract our kids so they wouldn't figure out what it was all about. Be prepared to be approached often by timeshare salespersons as that seems to be the standard in most of the hotels.

I (26) went with my boyfriend (32). We have both been to Vegas at least 6 times each and in the past we've stayed together at the Monte Carlo, MGM, Aladdin and the Mirage. From reading reviews on here I wasn't sure what to expect... seems people either think Excalibur is great or should be torn down. But I have to say, in comparison with the other hotels we've stayed at on the Strip, Excalibur was pretty great! Check-in was fairly easy... got a Widescreen room in Tower 2 on the 22nd floor - king bed, non-smoking, just as requested. Tower 2 was a great location because of it's really easy access to the pool... although, Tower 1 wasn't too far away... either way it would have been fine with us. The room was very nice, bed was super comfy, TV was nice and we had a great view. The bathroom was big and had a big shower (no tub). Lots of storage space in the room, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, and there was also an in-room safe which I think only the Widescreen rooms have. The pool area was great! I tend to pick hotels with the pool in mind so I was excited to see Excalibur's new and improved pool area. Four pools (one for adults 18+), 3 large jacuzzis, and lots of room. We never had a problem finding chairs no matter what time of day we hit the pool. Also, another good thing I noticed was there were a lot more shady spots here throughout the day than at some of the pools we've been to before. The pools were very nicely landscaped, drink service was fast and the new Drenched restaurant was really good - got some breakfast by the pool a couple times. Excalibur also has nightly pool parties with a live band from 4pm til 8pm - the pool is open from 9am-8pm daily (at least for the summer). All 4 pools were open every day we were there except for one day when one of the main pools was closed, but the pool area wasn't crowded so it didn't really matter. Food choices at the Excalibur are okay. They have a food court which is nice for a quick, cheap eat. The Sherwood Forest Cafe is open 24 hours and was very good and great for the value. We'd eaten at the buffet there on our last trip and it wasn't that great, so we skipped it this time. We also ate at Dick's Last Resort which was tons of fun... we hung out there at night one of the nights we were there and they had a really fun live band playing. Lots of drinking and dancing and very casual. The Luxor is directly connected with the Luxor, Mandalay Bay, NYNY, and MGM, so you have lots of options should you decide you want to eat elsewhere but don't want to hike down the Strip. A few things slightly annoyed me about the hotel, but in no way sullied our stay there. 1) It stinks that all the theming is being removed from so many hotels because Vegas is trying to be so \"hip.\" We stayed at the Excal. because we love the old school Vegas theming and it seems like it will soon be a thing of the past and everything will look the same. I noticed that Excalibur was trying to get more hip and sexy with the addition of Octane (a bar on the second floor) and a party pit casino section with scantily clad go-go dancers (parents may want to avoid this section). 2) I don't necessarily mind kids in Vegas, they are at every hotel and Excalibur didn't have any more kids then any of the other places we visited or have stayed at, BUT there were a LOT of ignorant parents there. Letting kids run up and down the hotel hallways screaming, kids running around the pools and going into the adults-only section, etc. It actually made me think that if you're bringing a child under the age of ten for more than one night (at any casino) you're making a huge mistake. All-in-all, we had a great time at Excalibur and I would stay here again. We got a great value on the room and airfare through US Airways, and we really enjoyed the casino, the pools, and our room. My only complaint (being a girl) is that there was no full-length mirror in our room - but hey, if that's my only complaint it couldn't have been that bad!", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central MN", "Title": "\u201cWould Stay Here Again!\u201d", "Author": "Where2nexttrip", "ReviewID": "UR19215371", "Content": "Booked a widescreen tower and was upgraded to a widescreen deluxe (a little larger) just for asking!

Reading about dirty rooms, bad window views, and rude service almost made me cancel my reservation. I booked the basic room for about $60 per night. Upon arrival at the hotel, the check-in process took no more than 5 minutes. Although I wasn't given an upgrade to those fancy-schmancy rooms, I was given a 21st floor room in Tower 1. I had to say I was scared to open the door. However, after stepping into the room I found it was clean and very spacious. The decor may not be brilliantly colored but the peach/brown theme suited well for the medieval themed hotel. The view outside my window was beautiful. The room faced the castle and New York-New York Casino. On the first night there were minor mishaps in the bathroom. After calling the housekeeping service, help arrived in no later than 6 minutes. This fact earned my respect because of how quickly they solved our problem in such a large hotel (over 3,000 rooms). My family spent some time at the arcade area downstairs. The arcade games were fun, but we would have played more games if the majority of change machines were not broken. The hotel has a 4-D theatre where you could ride and watch Spongebob, ride an extreme log around the depths of the AMazon river, or escape the claws of a T-rex. 1 movie for $9.95, 2 movies for $10.95, or all 3 for $12.95. The sales representatives didn't prove to be annoyances during our sales. I realized that they seem to target couples or families that have at least a male. Excalibur has a free tram that connects you to its sister hotels, The Mandalay Bay/ THEhotel and Luxor. Within steps away from Excalibur is New York-New York, MGM and the Tropicana hotel. Since the Excalibur is located at the southern tip of the Strip, I recommend taking the Vegas Monorail ride, which takes you anywhere in the Strip for $5 per ride. There are other deals like one day passes or 3 day passes. If you are planning to go to the Grand Canyon (which you should if you have time to spare in Vegas), DO NOT GO TO THE CONCIERGE HERE AT EXCALIBUR! They will offer you the $192+ trips, which are severely overpriced. What I did is I picked up those free magazines that you find at airports or at tourists centers and flipped through the pages. I found a bus tour company that offered tours to the Grand Canyon, complete with a small breakfast and lunch, for only $95. I went with my family and I enjoyed it. We went to the South Rim. My bus driver was funny and very informative. He showed new movies like Transformers, RV, and a few Grand Canyon documentaries that weren't boring. What I didn't like about the Excalibur was it's pool hours. They were unreasonable. For a city that booms at late hours of the night, the pool closes at 7pm. The hotel guide, that you find at your hotel room, does not show pool hours. Due to the heat at Las Vegas (which reached as high at 110 during my stay), many people choose to swim either at the early morning or at night to avoid cancerous UV rays. Here, ithe pool hours are from 9am-7pm. I wished they would have changed it. Other than that, my stay was wonderful.

As a travel agent I received a good fare on an airline and decided to take a friend with me to Vegas as I send clients all the time but had never been. First of all, we checked in LATE. It was about midnight when we got to the front desk, but the line was short and we talked with a cheerful man who upgraded us to a smoking room in tower 2 ( had booked a smoking strip view room in tower 1 ) which improved my mood considering the airline had already lost one of my bags! So, that was a positive experience with the employee's there. * Note: When the airline found my luggage they sent it to the hotel and the front desk was prompt in sending it up to my room for me. Another positive experience occurred when we were trying to figure out the best way to go outlet shopping - a nice man at the guest information desk was very helpful. The room did not even smell of smoke upon entering ( though it did shortly afterwards as my friend is a regular smoker ) and was spacious and nicely decorated. One of the lamps did not have the lightbulb screwed in completely, however this is an easy fix! One turn and... let there be light. It is a medieval themed hotel so it is a little different in decor but still nice for an inexpensive hotel. Security was usually at their desk at the entrance to the tower, though I noticed that they were there more in the evenings and at night than in the morning. I'm thinking that there's generally less trouble between 9am and noon than at other times though. The food court is very reasonably priced and convenient. The Starbucks came in handy after a few late nights. Speaking of late nights, McDonalds is open there 24 hours, but around midnight when everything else is closed the line up can get a bit long. My one complaint is housekeeping. They were prompt in the mornings, but one day we tried to sleep in and requested a 4pm or later service. They kept coming to the room and calling up to see if they could clean yet, and we kept having to repeat that we wanted it cleaned after 4pm. When they did arrive at 4 and started cleaning they yelled back and forth in Spanish, pointing around our room at our things and our bedding making us feel very uncomfortable. We requested they change all the bedding as it was our fourth day there, and they seemed upset by this. Also, they missed cleaning a cookie chunk which was there upon our arrival to the room. When they missed cleaning it up again, I called down and the girl who answered was very apologetic and offered to get it cleaned right away. I should have said yes! I just told them to get it tomorrow, and so it stayed there until we checked out as they KEPT missing it. It was partially covered by the bedside table, which might explain why. They do clean a lot of rooms in a short time and probably don't look as closely as they should. Did it ruin my stay? No. And it was likely not a regular problem there. But it begs mention anyways. The pool area is fantastic, great for kids with the slides and good for adults with the adult only pool and cabanas for rent. I must also mention that if you have a good sense of humor that isn't easily offended, Dick's Last Resort is a great time. I wouldn't go there if not ready for some friendly sarcasm from the staff though. We also had the \"tall drinks\" which are 32oz. souvenier cups that they fill with Pina Colada, Margarita, etc frozen drinks for $15. Refills are $9. And you can take them with you out on the strip easily - due to their shape, they don't really spill. The walkways between the MGM grand and New York New York were handy to see more than just our hotel easily. A constant flow of people going back and forth, and some good photo ops on them. A few bums looking for a handout, but they are quiet and unobtrusive. We explored a few hotels and this one was fairly easy to maneuver. Others were crowded or confusing. The Luxor is a maze to get to the rooms, but nice. MGM is huge and the whole thing is a massive maze! Finding the Monorail in there is hard, but worth it to get around the strip. Raoul who works the jello shooter bar Monday evenings there is great. Imperial Palace had neat \"Dealertainers\" ( celebrity look-alike dealers ) and a Billy Idol impersonator on a table but was extremely crowded, even for Vegas. Planet Hollywood is definately the \"Party Place\". New York New York was nice, and so was Treasure Island. Out of all of them Excalibur and TI were the easiest to deal with. Check out staff not as friendly as the check in, but not rude either. Please note that on top of the $1/day phone fee for local calls, they will also charge you an additional $1 for each 1 800 call. As two girls, the time share people were almost non exsistant to us. We didn't have any problem avoiding them. Overall, a pretty good experience and I would recommend this hotel to budget travellers looking for an inexpensive, fairly kid-friendly property on the strip. You could, conceivably, get everything you need just inside this resort - but what's the fun in that? Good launching pad to explore Vegas.

Overall the room was average like any regular motel. Beds were very comfy though. Be aware they charge you a daily fee for the phone whether you want it or not (bit of a scam in my opinion). I have stayed at Caesar's & the Mirage on previous trips & had a fantastic experience in both room comfort & casino facilities. The excalibur is lacking in both. This is why I would recommend if you've never been to Vegas before pick a better hotel than Excalibur. If I had stayed here first I might not have been so keen to come back at all. The class of the casino really does factor in. I know people say it's just a place to sleep but having the restaurants, bars, shows, gambling of the Mirage quite literally at your feet makes a huge difference to me. The Excalibur casino is dark & has a peculiar smell (like boiled cabbage!), the decoration is uninspiring (compare the check-in desks of Caesar's), the bars are rubbish & restaurants even worse.

We ended up driving for 15 minutes before parking in the hotel \"garage\" car park (multi-storey to us Brits) and had to drag 4 heavy suitcases for 20 minutes before we found a door into the hotel, and then another 10 minutes to find the reception area (where we queued for another 15 minutes).

The hotel corridors were full of uncollected trays and litter. This was the most expensive hotel of the trip and it was just downright rotten.

Yes as soon as we walked to the lifts we were approached by the time share people but i found a quick \"no thankyou\" and walking straight past them was most effective - however towards the end of our trip i spoke to one of the agents near the upstairs food court and basically they pick you up from the hotel give you a free breakfast or lunch give you a presentation then you get either free or half price tickets for a show - if you are there for a few days 4 hours out of your trip might be worth it, i may certainly consider it next time!!.

Ideal for families, although any elderly or diabled visitors may find the locaction a bit far from the centre of town, as the buses turn up when they feel like it and the nearest monorail station is quite a walk away inside the MGM Grand hotel. Although the staff were fairly pleasant, we didnt experience the level of customer service most of us have come to expect when visiting America. The room was very spacious, clean and well kept, houskeeping was very efficient. There is a food court on the first floor, with a Macdonalds (24hr) and other fast food retailers for pizzas, donuts, steak subs, cakes etc, providing a good choice of standard fast food fayre. There are a number of restaraunts within The Excalibur, the Sherwood Forest Cafe we found to be very good (24hrs), good service and great food fairly reasonably priced. As far as drinks go, as the average age of our party was 45 years old, we found it quite strange to be asked for our passports when ordering drinks at a couple of the bars within the hotel, but apparantley this is usual practice, so get reception to photocopy your passports for you, as you wont want to be carrying your originals around with you all the time. Beware of Dicks Bar, we paid \u00a322.00 for four pints of lager!!!!!!!! There is a policy of sarcasm towards the customers, which is supposed to be funny, but to be honest its lost on anyone apart from the Americans, we just found it quite rude! So we gave Dicks a miss after our first and only visit. The other bars are ok, with bands on each night. Its a good idea to shop around for cheaper bars outside the hotels, theres a great mexican resaurant by the M and M shop where we found our lagers for two dollars a pint. There are a couple of shows on within the hotel, the Knights of the Round Table show in the basement theatre was good, particularly for the kids, loads of audience participation, jousting knights, tumblers, jesters, knights on horseback, with a meal thrown in. If you are a first time traveller to Vegas, as we were, you may be unaware of the Tix for Tonite ticket shop located next door to the M and M shop just down the road on the strip, tickets for most of the shows on the strip can be bought here on the day of the performance for big reductions, so dont buy your show tickets direct from the hotels. As far as getting around is concerned, we tried all modes of tranport Vegas had to offer, the buses - dont bother - they turn up when they feel like it and are usually packed to the rafters., the traffic is so bad on the strip that it will take you ages to get anywhere. The monorail, which was reliable and clean but could prove expensive and the stations were quite a walk away. We decided that travelling by taxi was best for us, they are faster as they could use the backroads unlike the buses, and more cost effective, but there were four of us, this may not be the ideal if there is just two of you.

One had a broken toilet seat and cracked counter top. The other bathroom had broken tile on the floor and stains on the counter top. Both bathrooms were not very clean: hair in the shower, mild film on the shower door. Overall they were just bad. We agreed to just get through our two nights and never stay again. We chalked it up to a learning experience. One other change we noticed since our stay years ago is the presence of sales people in the main walkways of the casino/lobby area. They stop anyone that will respond and try to sell them show tickets, vacation deals, etc...It is very tacky. As for the dining options they are average Las Vegas. Just don't try to go to the food court during average meal times. You can't get near a counter to order as they are jammed packed with people. Breakfast time is especially bad. During all times there is a lack of seating and trash all over the place. Overall we will not be staying at this hotel again. Yes it is on the strip, but there are plenty of other options. Until something major happens to gut out and redo this place, just visit it as walk thru, don't stay.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat cheaper hotel on the strip\u201d", "Author": "edinm", "ReviewID": "UR18115006", "Content": "We spent a week here and had a great time. The Excalibur is about the best deal you can get on the strip. We paid the extra for an upgraded room it seemed to be worth it. The bedroom was spacious with a huge bed and flatscreen TV, we got a great view of the pools. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a giant shower and great toiletries. We heard no noise from the corridor at all. You have to pay extra for wireless access but that seems standard in Vegas. We also noticed that there are a lot less cable channels than in other places in America, again may be standard for Vegas. We ate at a couple of the restaurants, an Italian and Sherwood cafe and both were great. The pools are fantastic, lots of beds, 4 pools to choose from and a couple of slides for the kids. Waitresses come round from the bar regularly. As we were there in April it wasn't as busy as it must be later in the year so I guess sunbed availability may be less then. We didn't gamble but we took a coupld of the free lessons in the casino and they were excellent. Staff were all very helpful and our check-in/check-out experience was quick and easy though it does get very busy on Friday nights. We checked out using their kiosk, very useful. There are lots of lifts and they split the floors between them so you don't have to wait long and no need to spend all day in the lift either. It's located at the end nearest the airport, with MGM, Luxor, New York New York, Tropicana all nearby. Transport in Vegas is pretty good (buses less so) but all the same a hotel nearer the centre of the strip would be more convenient. Overall we had a great stay, no complaints. It'd be great for families, lots of kids games downstairs, family restaurants, good pools and of course the medeival theme. It's Vegas on a budget which was perfect for us, if you are prepared to pay more for more luxury then choose another hotel.

We finally ended up with my husband dropping me and the luggage at the door while he searched for a parking space somewhat nearby. One of the bellman noticed me, and offered to help me inside (it was 109 degrees!!!). He helped me in, and even went out of his way to keep an eye out for my husband. Check in was relatively uneventful and quick. We had booked the room online and had already paid 1/2 of the amount for a deposit. Our room was located on the 16th floor of tower 2. The room was clean. We had one of the rooms with a plasma TV which was nice, but my husband was disappointed in the small number of channels. We had a nice view of the strip, but noticed later on that even though the view was nice, there was the noise of the traffic, too! There were a couple of things I that I would have liked to have seen in the room: A full length mirror would be nice, as well as some sort of shelf in the shower on which to place shampoo, etc. (there is a soap dish). Also, the lighting in the room could be a lot better - it was nearly impossible for me to read my book at bedtime... We attended the Tournament of Kings show and thought that it was really good - considering the difficulty level of performing such a show. The food was surprisingly good, and the service was good, as well. Check out went smoothly for us ... we used the check out kiosk located in the lobby area near the elevators. One thing we noticed about the hotel is that there were a lot of children !

There is no coffeemaker in this room (although I didn't mind, others I was travelling with did). The room key card was fickle and it took several attempts to open the door each day. All that being said, the price is hard to beat for the quality and location of this hotel. The casino has a lot of varied slots but I thought it was a little low on tables. The sports book is big and comfortable enough. There is a small food court with fast-food restaurants and there are four or five more traditional restaurants. The Camelot Steakhouse was excellent. The Roundtable buffet food was of mediocre quality but it's hard to beat the price on the central strip ($16.99 dinner). My travel companions said that the service at the sherwood forest cafe was terrible (but food was good). The excalibur is in a good location across from the Tropicana, NY/NY, and MGM Grand, and next to the Luxor. There is a free tram that runs from the Excalibur to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay.

The other thing great about the excalibur, is Location, iths hard to find another casino&hotel right there on the Strip for that price.

There is 1 pool for adults only, and the other 3 are for adults and kids, and were not espectacular but did the job just fine. Being a fist time player in casinos, I found that you could actually win some money (change) in the slot machines, and spend a couple of hours with 1 or 2 dlls (I also stayed at the venetian and you could win at all on those slotmachines, and your dollar would evaporate in just a few minutes). Tournaments of Kings was a lot of fun (Dinner was Huge), and shouldnot be missed. The gaming area (carnival) for kids, was so-so, I guess only really small children (like mine) could find it entertaining ( I did win several plush toys). *Tip.

The Excaliber is a great little place to stay - it's clean and comfortable and centrally located on the Strip. It is a little crowded, smokey and noisy, but then again, virtually every hotel on the Strip is loud and smokey. The only downside are the \"greeters\" just inside hotel - these are folks offering you \"free show tickets\" virtually every time you walk past them. Come on now - I wasn't born yesterday. There's no such thing as a \"free show ticket\", especially in Las Vegas (not without sitting through a 90-minute demonstration about a time share).

I really liked that the McDonald's had the $1 menu so we were able to keep food cost down. We did try the Roundtable Buffet once for dinner and didn't care for it.

We didn't visit any of the sit-down formal restaurants because we come from New Orleans and can get that at home for less cost.

I would have enjoyed being able to cool down without the worry of sunburn after 5 minutes. I did enjoy the location on the strip. We were able to get to the other hotels easily and really enjoyed looking around. We aren't big gamblers but had fun giving the casino's our money on the slot machines. Actually, we came back to the room with more money than we left with each night so I can't complain. I didn't enjoy the time share people, my husband and I just split up and we weren't approached, however, we shouldn't have needed to do that. They were everywhere so I can't say that it was only an Excalibur thing. When they did catch us off guard on the strip, I just kept walking without looking back and eventually they would stop yelling and hound the next couple or family they came across. I loved being able to Valet the car and never waited more than 10 minutes to get it back even when they were busy.

I wrote a pretty negative review. So when we needed to go to Las Vegas on 7/3, the first night of the big holiday weekend, budget and location were our primary needs so we gave the Excalibur another try. Our experience was very pleasant this time., We paid $71 (total $79 with tax and $1 automatic phone charge) for an upgraded room in Tower II. Upgraded because you now get a flat widescreen tv, though if a lot of channels is important to you, you won't get them, and new marble-like countertops have been placed over what appears to be older furniture. Still, the room was clean and in good working order. We were comfortable EXCEPT for two very minor nitpicky inconveniences: 1) When we first got to the room, our hot water was only lukewarm. However, maintenance came up within 15 minutes of our call and he did agree the water was strange. Basically, he put it off to the fact the hotel was booked and water usage was high. No matter, he said he would look into it and suggested we try again in 30 minutes. We did and things were fine. 2) This room was obviously older as evidenced by the window/wall unit air conditioner, like an older motel would have. It was noisy but did not present a problem with our sleep. We did not eat in any restaurants or use the pool. For those new to Vegas, the location is perfect if you want to access many hotels without getting in your car or walking forever. You can access the MGM, New York, New York, and the Tropicana via a bridge and a tram connects you to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. As others have mentioned, this hotel does not strive to be anything other than what it was built to be-an economical, no frills place for those on a budget. If that is all you need, I think things will work out for you.

However, tip number one, check in is at 3pm, we went at 1pm and stayed in line maybe 5 minutes. I highly recommend trying to check in early. Check in is at 3pm, but most rooms are available before then. The gentelmen that checked us in was very accomidating. I asked if we could please have a room in tower 2, but he let me know that the rooms there are the deluxe rooms and that it would be a $20 a night upgrade. Knowing that I didn't really come to Vegas to stay in my hotel room, I asked him if we could atleast have a room on a higher floor. Well not only did he give us a room on the 21st floor in Tower 1 by the way, but he upgraded our room to the jaccuzi room which is all the way in the front of the castle with an amazing view of the strip!!! We were so thrilled!! We loved our jacuzzi, after a long day of walking the strip it was perfect to go relax in our jacuzzi and look out the window to the colorful Vegas Strip. So tip number two, ask if any jacuzzi rooms are available!! The room was clean and just fine. The maid never came and pulled us out of our room at the crack of dawn, we always had fresh towels and a clean room no matter what time we finally woke up and got rolling. The Excalibur also has a very decent buffet on the upper level. We ate there for lunch there for a couple of days. There is a lot to choose from, and it was very fresh. Also for two people only $30 bucks, not bad. The Excalibur also has a great players card. I highly recommend that when you check in go register for the Members Reward card. We used it there, at MGM Grand and by the fourth day that we left we earned enough for a $30 comp at the Sherwood Cafe at the Excalibur. We had a hearty breakfast with that certificate and couldn't have been happier. Here is the ONLY downfall of not only the Excalibur but most all of the Casino's, THE TIMESHARE PEOPLE!!! They are relentless, and won't give up. No matter if your checking in, strolling through or checking out they are still stalking you!!

I was also given $25.00 in food coupons, $10.00 in match play money and two complimentary spa visits (that valued at $20.00 each). We used all of these so basically the room was free - not bad for someone who doesn't gamble very much. The room was great - clean and comfy. We had two queen size beds with a flat screen tv and a nice size bathroom. We stayed in tower 2 which is very convenient to the parking lot and the pool/spa area. The hotel has 4 decent size pools. 1 is reserved for adults. One of the pools has a slide for children (and there are LOTS of children at this hotel) and a waterfall. All of them were very nice. None were over 3.5 feet deep. The casino is big. Table minimums are $10.00 but do drop to $5.00 on occasion. There is the usual food court/shopping/buffet area on the second floor. We ate at the buffet using the afore mentioned coupons. It was average by Vegas standards. The hotel has an indoor walkway to the Luxor which is next door and a sky tram (monorail) that takes you to the Luxor and Mandaley Bay (which is next door to the Luxor). It also has walkways that cross over the Las Vegas Blvd. and Tropicana Ave. which makes getting to NY NY and the Tropicana very easy.

I stayed in an \"older\" room to save money, and the bed was not plush, but everything was clean and in good order. (For a little more you can get rooms with new furnishings.) I am pleasantly surprised that such a massive hotel can offer affordable rates and still give good service (though I didn't have a lot of special requests.) Excalibur seems to be well run by people who are still trying to do a good job. Some of my family members stayed at a \"Luxury\" hotel nearby and then at Excalibur, and actually liked Excalibur better, especially for a family with kids. Overall i found it a positive, upbeat atmosphere, and I would stay here again.

We checked in around 5pm on a Monday, with no wait. The clerk who checked us in was very friendly & got all 3 rooms checked in quickly. These rooms were very nice. Everything was clean, the beds were comfy, & the towels were soft. There was plenty of hot water & pretty decent water pressure in the shower. My mom and dad\u2019s wheelchair accessible room was perfect. The roll-in shower only had a small seat that folded out of the corner, but they called & requested a regular bath seat & it was in their room when we arrived back to the rooms that evening. Contrary to what a lot of people say, the hotel does not smell bad & it is not crawling with kids. Yes, the casino was smoky. Just don\u2019t sit next to a smoker & move if one sits next to you. I can\u2019t stand cigarette smoke but I could last in the casino for 1-2 hours before my eyes really started burning. Yes, there were kids there, but the only part of the hotel were the kids might annoy somebody was in the arcade. Even at the pool, kids were not a problem. Pool \u2013 The pool area was very nice. Our only complaint was very little or no shade. We were in the pool at 12:30 on a Thursday & it was not crowded at all. There were four pools & all were open at that time. One pool is for the little ones, it was only 2.5 feet deep. There was a pool for adults only, age 18 & up. Then there were the 2 main pools, which were plenty big & well protected by numerous lifeguards. One of these pools had 2 slides & one of these slides was closed when we were there. There were also 2 big hot tubs, each holds about 20 people. We did not use poolside drink service, so I can\u2019t comment on that. There were plenty of towels available & we were able to find a few lounge chairs. The cabanas looked nice, but we didn\u2019t rent one. Restaurants \u2013 We ate the breakfast buffet once ($13) & it was pretty good with a large variety. Staff was very helpful & friendly. We also ate at the food court a few times for breakfast & lunch. Lots of options here: Pizza Hut, Quizno's, Starbuck's McDonald's, Krispy Kreme, Cold Stone Creamery. It was always crowded at the food court, no matter what time of day. Arcade \u2013 The arcade was big & had both video games & carnival type games. There were quite a few games that were out of order, but I think there were still plenty of games to play. I thought it was cute that the prizes at the carnival games were all castle/medieval themed. We saw lots of kids and adults walking around wearing Viking hats, etc. Check out \u2013 We used the express check out kiosks & they were very easy & convenient to use. Tower II Widescreen rooms \u2013 A few more comments about this: If you stay in a Tower II room, look for the parking lot behind Excal that takes you right into Tower II. It took us a few days to realize it was there & you can avoid walking all the way across the casino. If you plan on using the pool, you might want to book a Tower II room. The pool is located right outside Tower II, but people from Tower I had to walk all the way thru the casino to get to the pools. All rooms in Tower II do not have a view of the Strip. Ours had a view of the turrets of the castle. Timeshare Reps - I wasn\u2019t bothered at all by the Timeshare people; in fact it took me 3 days at Excal before I realized that the people in the navy blue suits were Timeshare Reps. Just don\u2019t make eye contact with them. If you do, a simple \u201cno thanks\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re leaving tomorrow\u201d will do the trick.

If you're hoping to do any quality gaming or enjoy the flash of upscale hotels you definitely want to skip this place. Positives: pool area renovated in 2007 has a nice atmosphere for all ages. Pool's daily happy hour from 4-8 isn't bad except for the service at Drenched pool bar. Also, the hotel is linked by walkways to New York New York, and Luxor and from these properties you can link over to MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay. Staff seemed very helpful...housekeeper was very pleasant and the lady who checked us inn was really sweet. Dick's Last Resort in the lobby is also fun. I t hought the Buffet was pretty good although others in my party thought it stunk. Negatives: Though the hotel is undergoing some renovation, many of the rooms are well-worn, dreary and in bad need of a makeover. Casino is very dark and also in need of a makeover. Gaming is HORRIBLE--if you want a $5 Blackjack table there is only ONE so you'll have to stand and wait for it for hours.

I remember staying here as a child and can't say much has changed since then. Literally, I think the carpet in the casino is still the same. The same cannot be said about the rooms though. When we checked in it was a bit chaotic and one of the front desk agents was a bit rude. She passed us on to another agent right before checking us in because her shift was ending and she wasn't polite about it at all. However this turned out to be a good thing for us. The next gal to check us in was very friendly and found us the best room she had available which was in the newly remodeled tower. Our room had a flat screen TV new beds and linens and overlooked the strip. The rooms are also quite large with tons of counter space in the bathroom. I have to say I was kind of bummed out to be staying at the Excalibur but ended up being very pleased with my accommodations. Unfortunately a downside to this experience did occur. It was the buffet. We made a bad decision to have breakfast there. Whatever you do, do not eat at this buffet it is disgusting and you can pay the same price to eat at a buffet somewhere else on the strip, or you can by a cup of coffee and pastry at Starbucks. There is also a McDonald's at the Excalibur and that would also be a much better option. I wasn't able to find one eatable thing at the buffet aside from the oatmeal.

There was an issue one day when we heard some people getting into a yelling fight a few rooms down. We were concerned because it was getting louder and louder so we called the hotel security and they came right away and told the people to quiet down or they would be removed from the hotel. We were impressed with their speed and how the handled the situation. The pool area was wonderful!! There were plenty of lounge chairs available and 2 of the 3 pools were operating. The service was a bit slow, it took the waitress about a half an hour to bring us our drink order. Most of the time I got them myself from the bar on the pooldeck.

If you are easy to please then you won't be dissapointed. Tip: Excalibur is connected to the Luxor, go to the Luxor buffet! It has way more variety and the quality of food is alot better. Also the Pyramid Cafe in the Luxor had great food and huge portions. We ate mostly at the Luxor. The casino was lots of fun. We all won some and of course lost some. One of my sisters in law won $250 on a slot machine. We went to see Carrot Top at the Luxor, it was a great show!! He is hilarious! We also went to see Elton John at Caesars Palace. He was amazing!

The only advice i would give here is: avoid the reps. They are situated at the entrances and will try to sell you shows etc. I think there's some timeshare reps too because they only targeted couples. A polite 'no thanks' will do, but gets a bit tiresome after a couple of days so walk separately when you get near them and they think you're on your own and don't approach you!

One thing check price of rooms just before you go as I think the price had gone down and we might have paid over the odds for our first 5nights but the second 3 nights we paid less as the guy upgraded us and obviously saw the price difference. The food in the Sherwood Cafe is excellent[we didnt bother with buffet as you get plenty anyway and we prefered it cooked fresh] and my husbands a vegetarian and he loved their Walnut Salad. Pools really good only downside is no shade after 11.30am so we used to get out there at 9am and sit in shade till11.30 then have lunch.The airconditioning throughout hotel was on a bit high so it always felt chilly. We thought location fine. We used the Deuce two days whilst there, its $5per person for 24hrs,hop on and off brilliant as its a long walk in the heat. The fountainsat Bellagio worth seeing, also Freemont [downtown] the old part is worth getting bus too.If you get the Deuce from the hotel cross over and walk back towards luxor as the next stop loads of people wait there. You do get fed up with the timeshare people they grab you as soon as you enter hotel with your luggage so be aware of that seems like they are being helpful when in fact they just want you to go to a presentation. Just be firm and then just say whenever they ask Oh we're checking out tomorrow that shuts them up. Also on the strip there are people handing out cards for 'women' again just ignore them and don't let it spoil your holiday. All in all a great place and a great hotel for the price.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Girard, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value! Hard Beds!\u201d", "Author": "Amber12478", "ReviewID": "UR16939682", "Content": "My husband and I decided to try out Excalibur for this trip to Las Vegas. The rep at check in was very nice and made sure the room we were booked in was what we had requested. The room was one of the upgraded ones and the decor was appropriate. The bathroom was nice - though a showerhead that is larger or more adjustable would have been nice. The TV didn't get a lot of channels, and when we decided to stay in one night, the \"MENU\" button to access Movies instead acted as a \"LAST\" button - bummer. Complaints about the room include a bed that is SO hard - our backs hurt after sleeping there. In addition, the blinds for the window leave gaps that illumniate the room the entire night. The peep hole is up really high - I, at 5'4\" had to stand on my toes to see out of it. One last comment on the room - there is a deadbold on the door - you have to lift the handle. However, for the price we paid, we were very happy with the room. The casino played host to a number of very nice dealers who were playful and professional. I was shocked at the number of fellow gamblers who don't have the decency/know how with regard to tipping the dealers - I understand not tipping if you're not winning, but when you win hundreds or thousands of dollars at the table, at least tip your dealer! The restaurants at Excalibur are adequate. During this trip, we ate at Sherwood Forest four times and the buffet once. SF was great for the price and during one meal we had a waitress, Jennie, who was the best at customer service! The buffet has gone seriously down hill in the past few years. One huge complaint about Excalibur is the fact that they rent out space to so many Grandview timeshare hawks. As though it isn't bad enough that you can't get to the hotel from NYNY or Trop because they're at the entrance, they're also inside the hotel at the entrance and at the top of the ramp to go to Tower II (likely at Tower I as well - we didn't check). I just want to go on vacation and NOT be annoyed by these people! Everytime we returned to our hotel from anywhere we just split up and met back at the elevators because we just didn't want to be bothered! What a hassle! Vegas itself was surprising. We've spent the last few first weeks in June there and were surprised by the number of visitors during this trip. It is plain to see that the economy has taken a few blows when you can walk freely down the Las Vegas strip sidewalk (or watch the traffic actually move) on a Thursday night with plenty of room between. Nice for vacationing, though. Finally, watch for the local phone charge at Excalibur. If I had to do our trip over again, I would have refused it at the start and then went up stairs and removed the stupid phone from the jack and returned it to the front desk. This charge is a scam and although we paid it, Excalibur has lost a future guest because of it.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomery, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cWedding and Honeymoon Suite\u201d", "Author": "kspencer", "ReviewID": "UR16858106", "Content": "My husband and I were married in Excalibur's Canterberry Wedding Chapel.

The flight went quite smoothly. We arrived in Las Vegas at about 11:20am. A1 Limosine was waiting by Baggage Claim. There were 9 of us all together. We took the Limo to the Excalibur. They let us out right in front of the entrance closest to the Registration desk. Registration went quite smoothly. Our room was ready, we had a remodeled room in Towere II (with the widescreen TVs)....Tower II is not that close to registration. So we trekked through the casino with our luggage and went up to our room (14254). When we walked in the room it was extremely clean and laid out well. They don't have many TV stations, and the shower doesn't have any space for razors, shaving cream, etc. All they have is a place for a bar of soap. The room and the bathroom were spacious and clean....we were very pleased. We gambled at the Excalibur most of the day...the dealers were nice, the pit bosses nice, but I was a bit upset when I asked for a comp for dinner and the pit boss said I had to go to the card desk. Pit bosses cant give them anymore. We had a small meal at the Sherwood Cafe....I didn't care for it that much. I had the chicken tenders (easy, uh)...not real good, but the steak I had later in the week was delicious. I can't go day by day....to be honest, its all a blur, and I'm not a big drinker, but we went everywhere....so I'll do it this way...and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. Hotel - Excalibur The hotel was wonderful....we saw a few children, but nothing out of the ordinary. The time share people were bothersome, but I simply ignored them and kept walkin. Check-in was simple and I used the electronic Check-out by Tower II. I didn't like that they charged a $1 a day for phone usage, and I never picked up the phone. Not many TV stations...but when do you have time to watch TV. Casinos - We went everywhere...(Excalibur, MGM, Bellagio, Flamingo, Imperial Palace, NY/NY, Circuscircus, Rio, Palm, Gold Coast, Riviera, Golden Nugget, Fremont, Binions, Planet Hollywood, Luxor, Ballys and Paris)...I think that's it. The best dealers was by far...Ballys....they are so nice and so inviting. I was losing, but had a ball with the dealers. Excalibur was good too. Best luck was at MGM....I had a nice run at Crazy 4 poker. Riviera was the quietest I had ever seen. I mean they really are going to have to make some changes to bring people in.....it was \"going out of business\" quiet. That's sad, because I really like the atmosphere at Riviera. Shopping - I didn't do any. Food - I only enjoyed the steak at Sherwood Cafe (Excalibur). The breakfast buffet at the Excalibur was delicious and not too pricey. I also loved the food court at the Excalibur. We also had dinner at Emeril's in MGM...FANTASTIC!!!!. I had the seared sea scallops and they melted in my mouth....its pricey, extremely PRICEY....but well worth it. Well I guess that's about it....I simply loved my vacation. We are going back in January 09. We are going to Hawaii for my job and then will stop back through Vegas for 3 nights....I haven't decided where we'll stay.... The Excalibur was great, I simply loved it and for those heading to this hotel...if your in the remodeled rooms, I think you'll like it too. Any questions?

The water temperature was a little cold which was odd considering the 90 degree temperatures but maybe they keep it that way. There was ample space for everyone, even in the hot-tub. The casino was still smoky but as usual the slots were loose. Dick's Last Resort had great drinks and always carried a festive atmosphere. The connection to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay is always an added bonus. The quick eats available on the second level - Quiznos, Pizza Hut, McDonald's, Krispy Kreme and Starbucks are also a plus.

I also write lots of reviews and have to say this is the most harsh review I'll write thus far. I checked in on a Sunday night and was assigned a room in Tower II which is the nicer one as it has been updated more recently. The room itself was nicely done. 42\" plasma TV, nice furniture, etc. I just noticed an oily stain on one of the bed spreads. Good thing there were 2 beds and I only needed 1. The first thing I noticed was that there was NO dead bolt on the door and no security latch. Very strange, but I thought I'm in a casino where security has to be top notch. I checked in around 7pm quickly went to eat and then went to bed at 11pm as I was there for a conference and had to be up at 6am. At 1:30am someone barges into my room and completely startles me. Heart racing I end up yelling and the guy just said \"sorry\" and exits the room. One of the scariest moments of my life. I tried to call the front desk, but it took 20 min of constant ringing before someone even answered the phone. They tried to tell me that they knew about someone coming into my room and it was their fault as they were checking for \"unoccupied\" rooms and the guy must have went to the wrong room #. CHECKING for EMPTY ROOMS ON a SUNDAY NIGHT 1:30AM?!?!! They just told me to dead bolt the door which I told them was non-existent and he just sounded surprised there's no dead bolt. So all I got was an apology and I couldn't get back to sleep which completely ruins my first day of the conference. Next morning I go down to reception and complain to the person who is wearing the \"supervisor\" name tag. She just acted all surprised and just apologized. No offer to make things right. I couldn't care if they offered me a free night or free buffet since my company was expensing everything, but they could have at least offered. I did learn that you CAN dead bolt the door. All you have to do is turn the door handle up. I found this out as I was telling a co-worker my story and he told me what to do. He said there's a sticker on the back of his door in the older rooms of Tower I. Definitely no instructions in my room. So that event ruined my week since I just didn't feel safe in this hotel and had no faith in the management as I really think they sent someone to break into my room with full knowledge of what was happening. I can't understand why they would check for empty rooms at 1:30am. I even had the \"Privacy Please\" sign on the door. On other aspects of the hotel. Internet is wired not wireless and cost is $12.99/24h. Bathroom has a shower only and no tub in case that matters to you. The sink and counter are higher up which is good for taller people, but bad for shorter people. Pool area is very nice with 3 pools. One of those is designated for adults only.

My niece's purse and her boyfriend's wallet were taken and the thieves left them on the hallway after taking all the cash and credit cards. We had called security and they were rude. As we told them what happened, they pointed out the items that the thieves could have taken that were not taken. One of the security guys was humming while we were filling out the report. The management called our room later on and mentioned that security reported that there were 6 people stayin in the room when it was only registered for 4. There was actually only one extra person but she only happened to stay there one night. The lady on the phone demanded that the extra person leaves. It was like kicking us while we're down. Therefore, we decided that we no longer felt safe staying in the hotel another night and not particularly in that room. When we checked out, the lady who assisted us was a trainee and needed a supervisor / manager to approve the process. The manager did not even bother to look at us and acknowledge us. Good customer service is acknowledging your customers regardless of their experience with the hotel and hopefully the customers will consider coming back. But after the incident and the attitude we experienced from the workers, I don't think I will ever recommend this hotel to anyone I know. Another thing is that the doors don't have 2nd locks. You'll have to rely on the door shutting by itself and the only way to get in from the outside is through the card key. When we called for police report, the cop who came to assist us was surprised to see that the door didn't have a 2nd lock and she was concerned about that.

It is important to note from the outset that there were very large conventions in town that weekend that boosted the nightly rates, especially on Sunday night. The Excalibur was not one of my top picks to say the least, but I booked the room in advance through the hotel website, which gives a fairly good discount if you do so at least 30 days in advance. All of the MGM properties offer this, but it is non-refundable. The rate was $675 total for four nights. A bit rich for my blood, but it was the best deal we could get considering the weekend. We stayed in one of the newly-renovated rooms in Tower II. The room was as I expected based on other reviews. The furnishings were rather new, with a nice TV, safe, and other bells and whistles. The beds were quite firm. Too firm for my tastes, but not terrible. The bathroom was quite nice, although there is no bathtub. I never take baths anyway, especially in a hotel. The shower is quite large. There are indeed timeshare people all over the place downstairs. I'm glad that I was prepared for this, and they are very easy to spot. If you ignore them (I used the pretend-they're-not there method), it's really not a problem. The truth is that we saw these people in several other hotel/casinos, so it is unfair to say that Excalibur is the only place with these people. A local told me that they are desperate to sell these things b/c of the current market, so maybe there is some truth to that. The casino is nothing special, but this is true for most MGM/Mirage properties. The Luxor, Excalibur, and New York New York are all really more of the same. It is nice when in Vegas to stay at a casino that is fun to hang out in. After all, it is like your home-base. The Excalibur isn't particularly fun to hang out in, but it is close to other casinos. You can get to the MGM, NY NY, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Trop, and Hooters quite easily, the latter of which is a good spot for low-limit gaming. The Casino is very blah. You won't fine a low limit game (less than $10) unless you are there early in the morning. Even then your chances are slim. They have the full assortment of gaming though, and it is not any different then the other strip casinos for the most part. Very little video poker if you are into that. The hotel staff is friendly and efficient. Housecleaning did not come on Saturday. I did tip them the first day ,and they jazzed up the place a bit, which is nice. The elevators are great considering the size of the hotel - very fast and not usually too crowded. For a hotel of over 4000 rooms, this is a big plus. The cab line was never too bad, even on Sunday afternoon. Cabs to the Wynn run about 16 dollars, over 20 to downtown. They have valet parking, but my advise is to use the self-park, as it is very close to the building. I imagine that there is a wait for the valet. The food course is quite convenient - Krispy Cream has decent coffee, along with McDonald's and Starbucks. The buffet is just a little better than a college cafeteria, but it is only about 12 bucks, which can hit the spot at least one morning. I was worried that since this was more of a \"family\" establishment that there would be kids everywhere. This really wasn't the case. I saw children, but no more than at places like the MGM. Don't bring your kids to Vegas - seriously. The new pool is pretty nice, but there was a heat-wave last weekend and the temp was over 100 most days. This is not pool weather for me, so we skipped that. I checked it out though, and it is better than some other strip pools. Overall, if you are left with few reasonable choices (as we were), consider staying at the Excalibur. Given the choice, however, I would choose the Flamingo for a similar price-range. The location is better, and its an all-around better establishment. The five point scale here is a bit restricting, and on a ten point scale I'd give it a 7. Very suitable by my standards. Again, there are better places to stay, but you should not fear the Excalibur.

The meals were nice- if a little disorganised at the round table buffet- its good value for money for breakfast and dinner, but it was badly orgainised in terms of seating people and general staffing- we went to the MGM Grand hotel for one dinner buffet meal which was much better organised but was more expensive. One thing to be aware of is this hotel is right at one end of thestrip so if you are wanting to visit the other hotels , you need to allow yourself plenty of time to either walk or take the shuttle bus down the strip- its a good few miles from one end to the other and each hotel takes a long time to walk round as they are all huge! but its worth seeing them all.

I did not find any of the employees that worked at these places to be overly friendly AT ALL. Anytime we went there to eat they acted as though our presence and our order were a MAJOR inconvenience! The Excalibur is fairly close to New York, New York, MGM Grand, the Luxor, and Mandaly Bay but keep in mind EVERYTHING on the strip looks closer than it actually is! There is a train that goes between the Excalibur, the Luxor, and Manadaly Bay and it's free. \"The Deuce\" bus is a good alternative if you do not want to walk the entire strip. We bought a 24 hour pass but the night we rode there was a 25 minute delay (it's allegedly supposed to come every 10 minutes or so) which resulted in an EXTREMELY crowded bus and very angry people who could not get on because the bus was full. We rode for 3 stops and then got off because it was getting just a little bit too claustrophobic for my liking. We gave our pass to a couple that was staying at the hotel. There is also a train you can take but it travels on the other side of the strip and you miss out on the sights. The pool area was alright - I liked that there was an area for adults only (18+). On that note, I found there to be A LOT of young children at this hotel - from newborns to young kids. Even thought there were signs everywhere stating that it was against Nevada law for children to be on the casino floor they were EVERYWHERE. I don't think Vegas is really kid friendly town so I was shocked to see as many children as I did. Overall - our stay was good, ordering room service was good (except for the night that we ordered a well done cheeseburger and it arrived medium well but they were quick and friendly in rectifying the situation). I had to call guest services for a local number because we didn't have a phone book in our room, within 5 minutes there was a knock at our door and an employee handed over a phone book for us, we got a call about 10 minutes later to make sure that we received our phone book. And off topic from the hotel stay - if you're going to Vegas you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO go a Cirque Du Soliel show. We saw the show \"KA\" which played at the MGM and it was incredible. Words cannot even begin to describe how awesome and amazing this show is!! So in closing I would say that the Excalibur is a 'get what you pay for' kind of place. If you're looking for a hotel on the strip that isn't overly expensive than this is the place to stay.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Treatment at Excalibur\u201d", "Author": "Guinness5", "ReviewID": "UR15990210", "Content": "I stayed at Excalibur May 5 through 9, 2008 with a girlfriend. Our stay for the most part was nothing but wonderful. We chose to get a remodeled room in Tower 2 and it was well worth it. Everything in the room was new. I liked having the walk-in shower with the sliding glass doors, granite countertop and flat panel TV. There were 2 things that were not right when we entered our room. The first was the greasy forehead marks covering the window making it difficult to appreciate the view of New York New York. The second was the toilet seat that was so loose I was afraid of what might happen. Our call to maintenance was promptly answered. Within 5 minutes someone was in our room with a bucket of soapy water and a squeegee cleaning the window inside and outside. Before he left another person came to tighten the toilet seat. Five minutes after they both left we received a phone call wanting to know if everything was taken care of. I've never had such great service for issues like that. Walking around the hotel we noticed security, maintenence and remodelling people all around. All were courteous and alert. We spent a fair amount of time at the pool. There were 4 pools. One was not in use (although full of water). Another was 18 and over only. All the pools were too shallow for our liking and only one was long enough to do something resembling a lap in. Plenty of lounge chairs and life guards. One pool had slides going into it but these were never working during our stay. They told us they were only available for weekends. Why? There was food available at a small restaurant and bar with outdoor and indoor seating near the pool. There was also a waitress taking drink orders around the pool but this service was VERY slow. I never felt as if this area was truly up and running. The Spa is very nice. It is split by gender.

The remodeled widescreen room with two queen beds was very comfortable, with everything feeling new and modern. The bathroom was large with nice counters and a very big shower but no tub. They typically gave three towels each day and the basic soap / shampoo / lotion. The widescreen TV was nice and big but not many actual channels (maybe ten?) besides hotel / vegas info type ones and none of them were in HD. I would've liked at least one channel like disney for the kids but oh well, we are in Vegas. The food at the breakfast buffet was very good, but the dinner buffet was a disappointment.

The upgraded rooms are just okay. If you choose an upgrated room, expect a half-way decent hotel room, basically. Don't expect anything fancy. Basically, they're a just a step (or maybe a half-step) above a Holiday Inn. The room looked like it had been renovated, but done very cheaply. It also looked like the bathroom was only partially renovated - the shower and bathroom flooring looked old and didn't match the style of the rest of the room. Not a big deal. It was annoying that the shower didn't have any shelves, so we had to put our shampoo, etc. on the shower floor. Probably the most annoying thing was the fact that the the television reception went in and out (not that I spent my time in Vegas watching tv, but I did try to do that a little just to relax after a long day of sightseeing, etc.). The person I was staying with commented that her back hurt after sleeping on her bed, but my back was fine. There were a few other minor things that weren't that nice - like that each bed only had 2 pillows, our nightstand was missing its drawer pull and there was no hotel information book in the room, such as you usually have in hotel rooms. None of this really bothered me, but just made me feel that I wasn't staying in the lap of luxury. Some of my travel companions stayed in the non-upgraded rooms and they had some problems. I didn't visit their room, but heard that it was very old and not very nice. Also, apparently there was some kind of leak in their bathroom upon check-in and water was all over the floor. So, I would not stay in a non-upgraded room unless all you want/expect is a place to crash. I've seen several reviews mentioning timeshare people. This concerned me a lot. I pretty much had to stay at this hotel because this was where my companions were staying, and I was concerned about being constantly bothered by these people. I was never approached by timeshare people, and I never even noticed any. I am thinking that the timeshare people must approach families (I was traveling with a group of women). I did not use the spa, but after visiting the spa lobby, I would avoid it. I went down to inquire about getting pedicure. There were 5 girls behind the desk, only two of whom were working (and I think that one of them was a new girl being trained). Right when I walked in, one of the girls (Leah) was on the phone and was apparently frustrated by something and was cursing (the \"F\" word). I thought this was extremely unprofessional, and took away from any relaxing setting that you would want at a spa. Pedicures aren't offered at the spa - those are at the salon elsewhere in the hotel. The pedicure cost $55. I made an appointment and arrived on time, and was told to sit and wait. I waited for 10 minutes when the nail tech realized that I was there. Apparently, no one told her that I was there. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I was in a bit of a hurry, and it was just not very professional. The pedicure was just average, and not worth $55 -- though another woman at the salon commented that it was one of the best that she'd ever had. I'm not sure why she thought it was so great. In any event, I've heard that the spa at Mandalay is really good and you don't need to be a guest there to use it (it might cost you a few extra dollars though). Some random suggestions about Vegas after this, my first trip there -- --Do not go to Fremont Street unless you want to dance in the street and listen to live music (by cover bands), or if you have some kind of historical interest in seeing the old casinos. It is an hour bus ride to get there and there is nothing to see there. The Fremont Street Experience is simply a large videoscreen that shows videos of dancing (clothed) girls, like you might see in an MTV music video. There are also some lovely video screens advertising strip clubs that show women taking their tops off (with a censor bar covering them). I was told that there were shops there -- these are simply souvenier shops that are everywhere in Vegas. The casinos are VERY smokey there also. There are many other, better things to do in Vegas. --Wear your most comfortable shoes, as you'll do LOTS of walking. Things are much further away than they appear. --Take a cab back to the airport. You can reserve a spot on a shuttle for $6/person, but they come extremely early (they were going to send my shuttle at 4 a.m. and my flight was at 6:50 a.m.).

Went with another friend to attend a wedding and picked this hotel because other wedding guests were also staying here as the price was not too expensive. I found a great price through US Airways Vacations with my flight and hotel together. I arrived late (11pm) and it was really awesome to fly into vegas at night so you could see the strip and all the bright lights! At check-in there was NO line at this time of night and I figured there were no good rooms left because it was so late. I booked the lowest category room possible. I asked if there were any rooms left with any kind of view of the strip and she said no but we upgraded you to a room in tower 2 for no extra charge! I knew that would be a new plasma TV room so I was pleased. My room was great, floor 21 and I had a nice view between the towers over to the Luxor which looks neat at night. Big enough bathroom with a big shower, no tub, large granite countertop. Big TV but honestly i never even turned it on! This room was perfect for good sleeping, absolutely no noise at night, it was probably one of the quietest rooms I've ever had! The bed was really hard so I called housekeeping and requested a mattress topper(egg crate type of cushion). They promptly put one on both beds the next day and it made for much better comfort! The room was sufficiently cleaned each day. I really liked the selection fast-food type of restuarant stuff on the second floor, starbucks, quiznos, mcdonalds, crispy cream---YUM. I did eat at the Sherwood forest cafe and enjoyed it greatly. As a single person I skipped the long line and they were happy to seat just me right away! I even played blackjack for the first time ever! what fun, very good service with the free drinks too. As single girls we were NEVER approached by the timeshare people. PLUS, i tried to never make eye contact with them either, if you just don't look at them and ignore them as you walk by it shouldn't be a problem. I do think they prey on married couples and families. I never had a chance to check out the pools. As single girls we also LOVED Dick's Last Resort for our nightly entertainment! That place is a hoot! We met some really fun people and had a blast. The band played perfect music for dancing, beware of the employee near the bathroom area! This hotel is located at the end of the strip but it is attached to NY NY, Luxor, Tropicana, Mandalay Bay and MGM... Tons of stuff to do, there is even a bus stop right out front. The bus is cheap, $5.00 for a 24 hour pass but it will drive you crazy it's so slow! but, if you are not in a hurry no big deal! I did find the woman at the concierge desk to be slightly rude, she wasn't even very busy! Check-out, again, no line, no unexpected charges. I had checked my luggage in with the bell-desk in the morning as I had a very late flight that day and had no problems with retrieving it. Took a great tour to hoover dam and the grand canyon west rim on the day i left. Highly recommended if you have an extra day! Overall the complaints you will hear in this section, if you ask me, are from those who simply expect more than what this hotel has to offer. Do your research and you'll know this is not a 5 star hotel or casino. You will find rude people all over Las Vegas. Bed bugs, lost luggage, bad food, problems with the front desk, long lines at check-in if you arrive at a popular time, you will occasional find these problems at EVERY hotel, even the nice ones. This place for me was well worth the price and I would definately recommend it. Would I stay here again, probably not since it was my first trip to vegas and I like trying new places.

We booked our vacation with Allegiant Air for a GREAT price, so we were willing to make a few exceptions in the accomodations. Overall- the trip was fun and the Excalibur was average. I might stay there again, but I definetely prefer to stay somewhere located more central on the Strip. When we booked the vacation, we requested non-smoking king rooms. I also called to confirm this request. We checked in around 3:00 p.m. on a Thursday and there were no king beds available- so we had two queens. We checked in at a later time from our friends, so we did not want to upgrade to the newer tower as our room was to be across from theirs. We were offered to move to king bed rooms the next day, but we didn't feel like repacking/moving. The older rooms are just that- old. They were okay- and once you realize that you are just there to crash and shower- they are fine. They were clean, fairly roomy for two adults, and have nice big bathroom counters, and a big shower. It was a bit underwhelming, but fine overall for just sleeping. Other than that, check-in/out went smooth. The casino is fine- I would have preferred some newer slot machines that are offered at newer casinos- but still fun and has decent drink service. The timeshare reps are very bothersome. You can not walk anywhere without being offered a \"free show/dinner/etc.\" It is okay if you just ignore them, but it gets old fast! The same can be said about the stripper cards being passed out on the strip! If you had children there, that would be a definite problem for me! The pool seemed nice, but we decided not to use it. We were in the other tower and it seemed like too much effort to get ready, then parade through the casino to the other tower to get to \"relax.\" We checked it out and two of the pools were closed and it was very busy- no available chairs to be seen. But it seemed like a fun pool atmosphere. As for the restaurants, we ate at the buffet which was pretty good. We also ate the $7.99 steak special at the Sherwood Cafe which was pretty decent for a $7 steak dinner. My hubby had a hamburger and fries which were great. The food court has alot of choices for quick, fast food as well. We did enjoy some Coldstone Creamery one afternoon- yum! They also have decent shops and a walkway to the Luxor and tram to the Mandalay Bay which is nice. Overall, the Excalibur could use some updates for sure, but it is a fun area of the Strip and was a good deal for the cheap pricetag. It is a good choice for those traveling with kids or people that want a reasonable hotel room on the Strip.

The internet booking offered great Sun-Thurs rates, with a $20 upgrade option to a fully renovated, quiet room with a granite bathroom, new furniture and bedding, thick towels and very comfortable beds. There was an in-room safe, but no fridge or mini bar. My daughter loved the iHome clock radio, and my son loved the 42' plasma TV. There were 4 swimming pools, but the pool with the waterfall and the slides were only open on the weekend. The arcade was a bit tired, but they loved the virtual rides. The only dining that we did at Excalibur was the \u201cTournament of Kings\u201d Medieval dinner jousting show. The dinner was a plain roasted chicken & tomato soup (there was no tomato soup in medieval times- Columbus hadn\u2019t discovered America yet...) But the show had a lot of action and every seat was a good view. The hotel has a tram to the Luxor Hotel & Mandalay Bay Hotel, and a walkway to NY NY & MGM. So we had access to hundreds of restaurants, bars and activities without ever touching the street. If you want an excellent burger, be sure to go to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay. Wolfgang Puck\u2019s Trattoria Del Lupo was a disappointment-great service but way overpriced for what was offered. For the same price, Mesa Grill (Ceasar\u2019s) was a far better meal, or have an amazing meal at Daniel Boulud Brasserie (Wynn) or Aureole (Mandalay Bay). The buffet at the Rio Hotel was far better than the buffet at Treasure Island. You can get 2 for 1 tickets to the NY NY roller coaster if you visit the Adventuredome at Circus Circus at the end of the strip. The MGM lions were fun, we enjoyed the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. Beautiful flower show at Bellagio, but high winds canceled the Bellagio Fountains & The Sirens show outside of Treasure Island. The Penn & Teller show (Rio) was a riot, and they meet the fans after the show. But from Vegas, you can now get a quick trip to the Hoover Dam & Grand Canyon.

You can look around or take the tour, but don\u2019t spend too much time. Continue another 1hr 30 min to Grand Canyon West . $20 to park, and continuous busses take you to spots around the reservation. ***Watch out for AZ speed traps outside the reservation; they look for out of state plates and give you a ticket for 5 miles over the speed limit- those vultures even followed us for 20 minutes on our way home, but we knew better. AZ cars whizzed passed us, but they nabbed every CA & NV plate*** The Glass Bridge/Skywalk was incredible. You look through the glass floor to a mile down. And there was a spot that jets into the canyon, where you could climb and be in the \"center\" of this incredible cravat.

The first night was excellent since I immediately won enough money to pay for all four nights of the hotel plus some shows, etc. This was brilliant. However, if only I had a crystal ball, I probably would have stayed somewhere else. That night, we ate at the Sherwood Cafe and it was the worst food ever. It was not fresh and the pancakes were hard as rocks. We each got a hot chocolate that wasn't even stirred. We ended up not eating it and refused to pay. We were shocked that they got security over when we told them that the food was horrible and that we would not be eating it. Now, I could see them refusing to take it off the bill if we ate it but, we were very dissapointed in it. And, I assure you that money wasn't an issue since I had just won a jackpot. Even security was a little miffed that they got them over there. They ended up comping us. That was nice since we didn't even eat the crap. The upgraded rooms were at best mediocre and I'm not sure if $20 more a night is worth it. However, I would have hated to have seen the older rooms. Our view was of the towers and luxor; however, in order to have a view, we had to rig the blinds everyday because they did not work. We basically had to tie them up as high as we could. When you looked out the window, you could tell that others did the same thing. For upgraded rooms this was horrible. Maid service was not the best. The rooms were not dusted and the beds were made horribly. On the last day, I noticed some sticky scum on the blanket which really grossed me out that I had been sleeping under them. On my last night there, we decided to go off the strip for breakfast. When the valet drove up my Lexus, it was covered with tree sap, twigs and bird droppings. I asked if it was parked under a tree and the valet said that it was. So much for valeting your car....I could have parked it under a tree myself if that's what I wanted. I was livid and asked to speak with management. Management agreed that they had a problem with the sap and would take care of this before I woke up in the morning. Around 10:00am, I got a call from the Valet stating that I would have to go get the car washed myself and that they would reimburse me. Well, since it was almost check out time, they said that they would give us a 3pm check out time. So, off to the car wash. I had it detailed hours before I arrived in Vegas and they told me that it would have to be waxed again to get the sap off. So, I paid for the minimum to get it off. Two hours later, they were finished and we drove back to the Exacalibur. So much for two hours being wasted but, I was happy the SAP was off my car. So, the staff took care of it as planned and reimbursed me $35.00. Before we left to get the car wash, I was told that I had enough points on my card to get 2 free buffets. I asked the Manager, who reimbursed me for the car wash, how I get the buffets. She told me to charge it to my room and when I came down to check out, it would be taken care of. Well, we went and had our buffets and came down to check out. Well, at check out, they tried charging me for the buffets. Again, I was very upset since I had wasted my morning getting the car washed and now they were saying that I owed over $30 for the buffet. I asked for the Manager and she said, \"Well, we paid for your car wash and we gave you a late check out.\" (wasn't this nice of her to do this for us especially since neither were our fault.) I said, \"You know, I was told that the buffet would be taken care of too...what about my time.\" Thirty minutes later, after I started getting a little pissy with them, they finally comped our buffet.

When we arrived at around 7pm I asked at check in if we could have a room in Tower 2, the young lady looked at the computer screen and said that would be fine; she didn't ask for any further money so we were very pleased about this. Our room was on the 10th floor and had a view of the towers - it was just like the many pictures on the website, I particularly liked the amount of counter space in the bathroom and the hair dryer was quite powerful for a hotel one. It was good to have a safe and there was plenty of storage. Our a/c stopped working one evening and I rang down, 20 minutes later 2 maintenance men came up and sorted it out for us. The hotel is family friendly - as advertised - which is what we wanted. I didn't think it was particularly smokey. The Sherwood Forest Cafe was good and we ate there one night as they were serving steak specials for $7.99 - which were very good, they also had a good kids menu. We also ate at the buffet, which was cheap and cheerful with friendly chefs on the cavery station. The salad counter was good and well stocked but for a little extra we much preferred the Luxor buffet - which has a better range of food and is higher quality, it also has a dessert station to die for! We went to The Tournament of Kings Show one evening and were seated in the Spanish section with a very loud school/collage? party, so we got fully involved in all the cheering and booing and had a great time. The food is also good and plentiful considering it is mass produced. We spent a few hours in the swimming pool and had a fun time playing monsters and princesses with our kids. One pool was closed which we were initiallly disappointed by, but once we started playing we still had a great time. I don't know what they put in the pool but it ruined my and my husbands swimwear - it sort of ate away at the elastic in them - luckily we didn't notice until we were back in the room and I don't really care now if anyone else did! We were constantly hassled by timeshare staff but just said no thanks / not interested etc and that was that! No problem really. One evening was quite funny - I had taken the kids up at about 10pm using my husbands room key as I'd not taken my bag with me. He stayed downstairs to play BlackJack. When he tried to return he was not allowed by security as he didn't have a room key. They asked him the room number but he said 10214 instead of 10240 and when they rang up (luckily) noone was there. He asked someone to come up so I could verify who he was but they refused. In the end, after a lot of questions and answers at check in they issued a new key. So I will say that security is very good at the hotel!! Location is good and I don't know what all the fuss about walking the strip is about. Ok it was late March and we couldn't have coped in the summer heat but one day we walked across to the MGM and then all the way to the Venetian, we got a taxi to the Stratosphere to go up the tower and do the rides then walked back to Circus Circus then got a taxi back. Taxis are cheap. Las Vegas is great fun, the kids loved it (That will pick up some bad comments for me!) and we will go back and would stay at the Excalibur again.

The staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful... check-in and check-out went very smoothly.

I considered the Imperial Palace but decided on something a little more modern. We got a \"Widescreen\" room on the seventh floor. Room was very clean, a little small but not that bad. Housekeeping was good except for one day. I normally like rooms up high but it was certainly nice to not have to wait for the elevator ! I found the staff alright. Not great but not bad at all. Check in was very smooth and girl at the desk was helpful. Now, let's comment on other people's complaints: I've noticed a few people complain about the poor channel selection and all I can say is sure, but why on earth are you sitting in a room watching TV ? I also noticed a few complaints about the \"dark\" decor. Uh - medieval theme, right ? I liked it. A nice change to the other overly bright hotels. As for the constant barrage of sales people trying to push \"free\" vouchers, shows, timeshares, whatever. YES, I agree completely. This is rubbish and totally unwanted. As soon as I walked in I got caught off guard and one of them actually got me over to the desk before I realized what was going on. I hate being rude to people, but the best way I dealt with them was to completely ignore them and keep walking. Or if you want to have a little fun, some of them will walk up to you with their hand out and say \"Hi, how are you doing today ?\" I found a great answer was to shake that hand and say \"Well, I had some really bad diarrhea earlier but I'm doing alright now !\" But back to the issue, let's face it - just about everywhere you go on the strip you will run into these people and a lot of them are extremely nasty. It's part of the Vegas experience. As for the complaints about too many children in the hotel - I noticed quite a few children in all the hotels. Probably the most I've seen in 12 years I've been going to Vegas. Now for my one and only complaint about the Excalibur: If you get a room next to the elevator and are a light sleeper, go back and ask for another room. The A/C drowned out most of the noise but you can hear the machinery running all night. It wasn't terrible (or I would have asked for another room) but I can see it being bad for some people. So all in all, not a bad deal for the money.

Not the case this time... As I have stated in my other reviews, we are raising a 9 year old grandson. He wanted to see Las Vegas. My husband and I have been there several times and we knew that there were lots of things for him to enjoy (Hoover Dam, the Fremont laser show, the top of the Stratosphere, the Eiffel Tower, M &M World, the Bellagio fountains, the Habitat at the Flamingo, etc..). We also assumed that the Excalibur is family friendly. After all, there is the Fantasy Faire game room, the dinner show where you eat with your hands, the 4 pools, the whole castle themed thing... So we booked 2 rooms last December (3 months ago) for his March spring break. We reserved-and paid a deposit for-2 non smoking rooms with a wide screen TV and a view of the strip. We wanted non smoking as my sister and my grandson both have some problems when exposed to a large amount of smoke. Our flight did not arrive until 10 pm. When we checked in, we were told that all the non smoking rooms were gone. I said that I reserved these rooms 3 months prior. His reply was, \"it does not matter how far out you booked your rooms. It is first come-first served.\" He told us that if we stopped back at the desk after 12 noon the next day, we could get our requested rooms. He also said that the hotel staff would help us move our belongings to our new rooms. It was really late by that time, and we felt as though we had no other option. We got to our 2 smoking rooms on the smoking floor. Not all of the key cards worked, so we had to make another trip downstairs to get new key cards. The view from both rooms was the roof of the casino below. All we could see was the red and blue turret towers. No view of the strip at all. We waited till noon the next day and asked to be moved to the rooms that I had requested months ago. We were told that they had 2 non smoking rooms ready and I asked if they both had views of the strip. I was told \"yes\". We were told that we had just enough time to go back to our current rooms and get our suitcases out of the rooms as our key cards would momentarily be deactivated to our 2 current rooms. There was no mention of assistance from the hotel staff to help move us. We hurried as quickly as humanly possible to our current rooms. Guess what, folks? The key cards to the rooms that our belongings were in had already been deactivated! We were furious! We were on our way back downstairs to talk to-who -knows- who in order to get into our rooms so we could get our things out. We spotted a hotel staff member on our floor. We explained our situation and pleaded with him/her to let us into our rooms. This person kept telling us to go back downstairs and talk to supervision until he/she saw the desperation in our faces. We were let in only if we promised not to tell as he/she was afraid of being fired! Fired? This is the only person since our arrival that was willing to go above and beyond and they were afraid of getting fired? How sad...We offered him/her some cash for saving us, but it was refused. What an awesome employee to help us out even when it meant their job was on the line.... We finally get in to our non smoking rooms only to discover that only one of the rooms had a strip view. The other still had a view of the casino roof and the red and blue turret towers. Only now with this view you could also see old hotel room furniture stored in an area on the roof and also a \"punching bag\" that had been hung-for staff use, I guess...Yeah, nice view. Shame on the staff member that just plain lied when stating that both non smoking rooms had views of the strip. We were so tired of taking that long walk back in order to get what we asked for that we just gave up and took the rooms. But wait, it gets even better..We spent some time at the pool and wanted drinks from the bar. The line at the bar kept getting longer and longer. The bartender was refusing to wait on anyone. Instead, he was gathering up bottles and wiping down the bar area for closing time. It was still a good while before the bar was to close for the evening. The line kept increasing and he just kept ignoring the customers. Finally another customer became very upset and told the bartender that his job was to wait on customers as long as there was one in front of him. I could not agree more. The gathering of beer bottles, mixers, and liquors can wait until the customers have all been taken care of or until after the bar closes-not before. Finally another bartender came out, but he was not much more motivated than the other one. We actually heard one of the bartenders say, \"There are ticked off people here today. But I really and truly do not care.\" Yep, that was obvious,buddy. I am a former night club owner and I would have fired any bartender that had that attitude. And as for the bar/restaurant inside known as \"Dick's Last Resort\"-that place needs to be moved away from the path that leads to the rooms. As we walked by the place with our grandson (and there were a large number of other children on spring break walking by there as well) there was a young inebriated man and woman in the midst of an obscene and truly embarrassing act. I realize that it was also spring break for college students as well, but for Pete's sake, clean it up, Excalibur!! If you really see nothing wrong with what was happening in there, then please put up a wall so the rest of don't have to watch what bordered on \"porn!\" Family friendly hotel? I think not...... After our initial experience, we felt that we could just not spend our hard-earned money in the Excalibur restaurants, gift shops casino, etc.. So we spent it elsewhere on the strip. We felt as though \"we really mattered\" to the staff everywhere we went except the Excalibur. Customer service is what it is all about and my personal opinion is that this hotel just doesn't understand that. Even our 9 year old grandson picked up on the fact that the service was not all that it should be. I know that this \"vent\" won't make a difference to the hotel management, but I want the TripAdvisor readers to know about our experience. Will we visit Vegas again? Yes, indeed! Will we stay at Excalibur again?

The towels and sheets are changed regularly and it provides a quiet place to get your head down. The only gripe I had was with the hotel staff on arrival. We had requested a non smoking room and on arrival they stated they only had smoking rooms left. In order to get a non smoking room we had to pay to upgrade to a room with a view of the strip which was only about \u00a310 per night, but not the point. Agreed to do it eventually after a row with the manager however we were so tired we couldnt be bothered with it. The pool area has no brolleys or shade so is not suitable for young children, I think this is to encourage people to stay inside and gamble. The breakfast is fantastic and after paying a standard amount you can eat what you want, which is basically what happens at all hotel restaurants breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I feel bad for the families that ended up here on package tours with their young children (it must have been really weird for them to have their 10 year olds hanging out at the pool while 22 year olds got drunk a couple feet away). I have nothing against college students, but at 30, I'd rather not be in the middle of their spring break. The theme is the most played out theme on the Strip. Maybe they could update it, kinda like Treasure Island did by updating their theme from kid friendly pirates to sexy partygirl pirates... they could go for a sexy princess theme... or maybe they should just implode the place... or change the sign to Motel 6. The room was, in a word, gross. And in two words: gross and weird. The medieval stuff looks like it is from a flea market. Honestly, the only people I can manage this place appealling to are renaissance fair dorks or college kids that are just looking for a crash pad on the strip. The bed was noticeably sunken, I was scared to walk barefooted on the carpet (though I did see one 20 year old drunk guy walking barefoot through the casino), and I wished I would have had shower shoes for the bathroom.

Tower 1 requires you to walk through the casino to get to the pool. Speaking of the pool, the new area is now open and is VERY nice!!

From the bellmen to housekeeping, everyone was very accomodating and timely. Upon arrival (a Sunday) there was a little bit of a line at the Registration Desk but in no time we were on our way to the room on the 25th floor of the old tower. The \"view\" room was very clean, beds were comfortable as were the pillows. We stayed in the older tower but it was very nice and clean. The room design is of course themed according to the Excalibur which gives a dated appearance but I felt that went right along with the theme of the hotel. Housekeeping was very timely when calling for extra towels, etc. Our room did not have a refrigerator so we ordered one which was immediately brought to the room. The service was very good. The view room faced the other towers and revealed a partial view of the strip but this was not important for me as I didn't spend much time in the room anyway. I also, despite some reviews of the food, went to the buffet at this hotel as well and found the food and service to be very good as well. I had lots of seafood but the buffet offered quite a variety of food. I found the buffet staff to be very accomodating and friendly as well. Of course I had forgotten about the tour traps at these hotels and was approached to take a \"tour\" in exchange for free or reduced price show tickets, cruises, etc. on several occasions but that was no bother. After they saw me several times they stopped asking and a polite no thanks moved them on to the next tourist. The casino was busy but not extremely so. I like slots and found them to be fun and quite a variety (especially when you're winning!). I did see the Tournament of Kings show which was great. The showmanship was excellent. The food had a very good taste but caused me a little bit of stomach problem. No eating utensels required as the meal consisted of Cornish hen, broccoli, oven roasted potatoes, bread and unlimited soda/pop. There was a cookie type desert (I really don't know what it was) but it was not very tasty at all. At the end of the show we got to meet some of the actors and they posed for pictures with us.

The buffet is realitively cheap but the food is average at best. This hotel is perfect if you are just looking for a cheap place to rest your head that is central to everything on the strip.

I am in Vegas on business and attending a show at the Sands Expo center. It was a last minute booking so I had to take what I could get. I was disapointed that some of the hotels I have stayed at in the past where booked but that was my own fault. I booked the Excalibur and then decided to read the reviews. I will admit that some made this place sound like the worst hotel out there. I am in one the old rooms and while they look a bit drabby they seem to be very clean. They do have only a shower but I happen to think it's better than taking a shower in a bath tub but thats my opinion. The best thing I could say about this hotel is that it's clean but badly in need of a facelift. The saying \"You get what you pay for\" really applies here. I am not normally the type of person to judge people but I just can't help myself. The Las Vegas NASCAR race was yesterday and I can't even begin to tell you what some of the people here are like. There are drunks all over the place and they are loud and annoying. I have seen a couple of small fights for stupid reasons, I have seen a semi naked drunk woman getting ice in her panties and bra, I have seen more people without teeth than I have seen in a lifetime, and the rude comments to other women and cocktail waitresses was very uncalled for. To be honest there are so many rednecks here I was looking for Jeff Foxworthy. Ok, another problem many others wrote and I have to agree is the time share people. You can't walk in and out of this hotel without someone running over to you asking if you want free tickets to a show. I am smart enough to know that nothing is free and I usually smile and say no thank you however a couple where downright rude. I had a guy this afternoon actually say to me \"Well, then have a lousy day\" when I walked by him and said no thank you. I guess he was offended that I didn't give him some of my time. You know the hotels are making money off these deals but you wonder if they really realize that they are doing more harm than good annoying their guests. I spoke with many guests and all where just as angry. I didn't find the food bad as others suggested in fact I thought it was pretty good and the prices where decent. Someone wrote that it had a McDonalds like that was a bad thing but when your running out in the morning their breakfast is fast, cheap and not all that bad. Overall this hotel is very average and attracts below average guests because it's cheap. Expect a louder crowd and not the friendliest of people. I personally would not stay here again but I didn't want to this time either. I will say that in a pinch if I had to stay here again I wouldn't think it was the end of the world.

We stayed at the Excalibur in mid Feburary and found it fantastic and one of the best hotels we stayed in on our holiday - much, much better than best westerns or comfort inns that some people like to compare this hotel to. My children were completely overwhelmed at the magnitude of the place. Granted, we were in the recently refurbished tower 2, but we could not fault anything about this hotel from the time we entered to to the time we left. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and our room was clean and large enough to accommodate the 4 of us comfortably for 3 nights. I especially liked the huge bathroom. The sherwood forest cafe serve a lovely breakfast, better than the all you can eat buffet. the food court was also very convenient. I also loved the shops within the hotel. the kids used the pool that was open and it was large and clean with a lifeguard on duty. It would be great to go back when all the pools were open. Las vegas itself was fantastic, especially at night when the strip really comes alive. You don't have to spend lots of money whilst there either. As we were travelling with children in tow, the casinos were out of the question. We took in Circ de Soliel's Mystere one night and the other nights we walked the strip; taking in the fountains at the Bellagio, watching the pirates outside of Treasure Island and having a gondala ride at the Venetian, as well as shopping, shopping and more shopping. We also did a tour of the Grand Canyon by car. However as first time travellers to the GC I would not recommend this mode of travel. Although more expensive, a bus tour or aerial tour would be money better spent. The guy we toured with in his mini van gave no commentry on anything on the way (hoover dam, route 66 etc..) and when we got to the southern rim of the GC all we did was walk around a path for about a mile, caught a shuttle back and drove back to Las Vegas - all up an 8 hour trip.

The food court was fast, convenient, and relatively cheap by Vegas standards. We found Sherwood Forest to be slow, but the food was good, diner style food. The service at both could have been better. Sherwood Forest was really slow even though it wasn't really crowded when we were there, and the girl at Pizza Hut Express was just unpleasant. Also, the timeshare people that everyone seems to complain about are annoying, I can certainly agree with that. But they seem to be everywhere on the Strip, certainly at all the MGM casinos (which are about half of them on the Strip). Pretty much every time you go by them, they will approach you, but it's easy to shrug them off once you pass them a few times, especially if you're under 25, not married, don't have credit cards, etc. It's the same as passing the Grand Canyon tour solicitors, or the people passing out the porn cards.

If you have the time you really must do the \u2018Tournament of Kings\u2019 show. Buy your tickets at one of the half price ticket booths on the strip or at the Fashion Show mall. The show was typical Vegas, lots of theatrics, smoke and lights but was so much fun. The meal was medieval style and was yummy and pretty healthy (Cornish game hen, potato wedges, broccoli, roll, soup and desert). The show is great and is very interactive with the audience. We were seated in the \u201cIreland\u2019 section and even got a photo with King Patrick when it was all over. We didn\u2019t try any of the restaurant safe for Krispy Kreme and McDonalds for quick bites. I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews about the Round Table Buffet, we hit up the buffet at Treasure Island and it was just divine. The Excalibur is great, treat yourself and book a renovated room and have tons of fun.

We stayed at the Excalibur hotel on the strip, a typical Las Vegas hotel, huge room with views of the airport, the Luxor and Mandalay Bay hotels, cheap and brilliant buffet meals and lots to look at. Probably as a result of the eating culture in the States a high proportion of women and many men look as if they have to be winched through their bedroom window by the Fire Brigade each morning. A trend that is crossing the pond is the need to ride around in an electric buggy because the rider is far to fat to walk under their own steam! All of the hotels are about the same really with a foyer/casino bigger than a football pitch and in the city nothing closes so a game of roulette at 4am with a cocktail waitress providing the drinks is a cure for jet lag! This will be our sixth visit and apart from more building, not much has changed, walking down the strip one has to run the gauntlet of dwarf Hispanics flicking cards on their hands before shoving them at you. The cards advertise strip clubs and prostitutes; I don\u2019t know why the authorities allow them. That\u2019s about it though; the city is safe with little in the way of trouble it costs a lot to stay there but only through the enjoyment of a flutter in the casino. Last Tuesday we went horse riding in the Red Rock canyon, re-living the days of the cowboys on a 2 hour ride up the hills, no nice soft grass to ride on, all rough ground and climbing. Then it is back for a walk down the strip. Next door is New York New York with a scary roller coaster on the roof, opposite the MGM Grand well known for its concerts and main attractions. The expensive Bellagio with its massive water feature, over the road Paris with a near life size Eiffel tower and then The Venetian canals meandering through the hotel with gondolas and singing gondoliers. The Planet Hollywood hotel, originally the Aladdin, we stayed there twice soon after it opened, further down is another hotel that we stayed at, The Imperial Palace one of our favourites, a favourite because it houses probably the biggest classic car museum around and with a difference as almost all of the cars are unique \u2013 and for sale. Each hotel has a unique feature and as the strip gives way to more free land before the next hotel, one day this will all be hotels and casinos but now after passing a new shopping mall there is a gap before Circus Circus, one of the cheaper hotels. More shopping centres and the big Stratosphere towers above the ground with roller coaster and other rides on the top. Then we are \u2018Downtown\u2019 and for those planning a romantic Las Vegas wedding it\u2019s fair to point out that the chapels in the main are situated in this area with the strip joints, porn shops and rampant tackiness! Chapels with names like \u2018Th wee Kirk o\u2019er the heather,\u2019 \u2018Drive thro marriages\u2019 and \u2018The little white chapel\u2019 stand alongside cheap motels, porn book shops and clubs. The whole area is seedy. Not that being married by an overweight crooning Elvis Presley isn\u2019t anyway! Pass through this area on one of the regular and reasonably priced double decker buses called \u2018The Deuce\u2019 and you reach Fremont with its enclosed area containing casinos with names like The Golden Nugget.\u2019 Above is a huge curved ceiling that at night provides a light show with booming music, another place well worth a visit.

I booked a spa room for my wife's birthday directly from the company's website and had a printed confirmation specifying that I had prepaid for the spa room. When I arrived at 3:00, the lady at the front desk, \"Kelly,\" stated that there were no rooms available until 6:00 and she can't check me in. I showed her my printed confirmation with a check-in time of 3:00, and she immediately changed her story, stating that she could put me into a \"renovated standard\" room right away. I said, \"No thanks, we'll wait until the spa room is ready.\" Kelly replied that there were no spa rooms available that night. I reiterated that I had already paid for a spa room for that night. Then she informed me that I had been essentially downgraded and that the hotel was oversold for the night. Kelly also stated that the Excalibur website specifically mentions that your room type is not guaranteed. When I returned home, I walked through the reservation process on the Excalibur website and found no wording to that effect. Although, I was charged a lower rate ($161 for a regular room instead of $208 for the spa room, which meant they had to credit me because I had already pre-paid the $208), I really felt cheated by the experience. If I wanted just a regular room, I could have stayed downtown for half the price, but I wanted the spa room for my wife's birthday. I called the manager on duty who said the \"best he could do\" was to allow a late check-out which he claimed to be a $40 value. Two hours later, a recorded broadcast message on the voicemail to all guests offered a late check-out the next day for $25. Yet again, the employees are contradicting themselves and changing their story. Sadly, the ethical behavior of the Excalibur employees was downright shameful.

As hotels can get expensive very quickly when there's a trade fair on in Las Vegas (sometimes the price difference between a \"slow\" date and a popular one can be up to 1000%, so if you're flexible, plan your stay wisely!), I opted for the Excalibur as it offered reasonable value for money. After reading the reviews on this site and generally browsing the internet, I booked a \"Widescreen Room\", which means it's one of the recently renovated rooms at the Hotel. My room was number 25202, which means it was in Tower II, 25th floor, at the far end of the corridor, with no view of the Strip (I saw parts of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay buildings instead). The location was ok, although I must say that due to the room being situated at the far end of the corridor, it was always quite a long walk from the elevators and ice machine, which I therefore only bothered to use once (the ice machine, not the elevators). The room was immaculately clean (big plus!) and furnished with a very comfortable king size bed (two nightstands), a comfy armchair and a big dresser. There was also a small table with a 3 or 4 chairs in a little alcove (which was, alas, windowless). And yes, there was an enormous widescreen TV on the wall above the dresser. The bathroom was spacious and modern and also very clean. A small closet for clothes was built into one wall and that contained an ironing board and - for some reasons - two irons. Not that I'm complaining, but why two irons? Do people in Vegas go in for competitive or synchronous ironing on a regular basis? My first impression of the room was excellent and I did enjoy my stay. Still, here are a few things I noticed that could be improved: - High-speed internet access is offered for ca. $12 per 24 hours. The cable for this is extendable to around 2ft and is located on top of the dresser. If you want to use this, you cannot place your laptop anywhere else but on top of the dresser. The chairs in the room, however, are too low to make sitting at the high dresser comfortable. Also, you'll have to spread your legs wide because otherwise they have nowhere to go. Suggestion: Make the cable long enough (or provide an extra outlet) to reach the room's table, where people who need to work can actually sit comfortably. - There were a few freely accessible electrical outlets in the room, none close enough to the dresser to work with a laptop situated there. I had to use the one behind the dresser to plug my laptop in, which was a bit awkward and uncomfortable. - The lights in the room (one on each bedstand, one floor lamp, one hanging above the table in the alcove, one on the ceiling near the door) all had to be operated separately by a switch located on the lamp itself (except the one by the door). This means when you had them on and wanted to leave the room (or go to sleep) you always needed to walk to every single lamp to switch them off awkwardly with a flimsy little switch. Suggestion: wire them up to switches next to the bed and a central one near the door. - I had requested a non-smoking room, but I could faintly (but clearly) smell stale smoke in there and there was an ashtray in one of the drawers. The window could only be opened about 2 inches, no doubt for safety reasons. - The hotel provides shampoo, lotion, shower gel and soap in the bathroom. Whenever I opened the bar of soap to wash my hands and left it next to the sink, it was taken away by the maid and replaced with a new, wrapped one the next day. Seems like an awful waste. Only once did the maid leave the used bar AND put a new one there, which I would have preferred every day. - The humungous TV is nice, but was only capable of showing poor analogue-quality free network TV stations (around 8 or 10 of them), with seemingly nothing but news, teleshopping and commercials on all the time. All that with the strangely distorted picture you get when watching 4:3 content on a 16:9 screen. The only alternative is the hotel's pay-tv option, but who wants to pay almost the price of a cinema ticket to view an in-room movie? Suggestion: Get cable. ;-) Even though this is quite an extensive list, I must say that I did enjoy my stay and would probably stay at the Excalibur again, maybe trying to get a room with something that could be used as a desk (or bring an ethernet extension cord) next time. The atmosphere in the hotel is nice and relaxed and the guests are relatively \"normal\" people. I spent some time in more expensive hotels there and I wouldn't have wanted to swap the crowd with e.g. the Venetian clientele who were a lot more pretentious. Also, on the casino floor the table minimums were affordable ($5 for most games) and the dealers friendly (with a few grumpy exceptions). Peggy for example was a lovely lady who had no problem explaining some rules to a novice like me and was always friendly and accessible during the game. Check in and -out were swift and efficient, as was the Valet service in front of the main entrance. I didn't try any of the restaurants on the property (except for a sandwich in the food court) or any of the Hotel's attractions, so I cannot comment on them.

This hotel will have you feeling as though you've stepped into the fairy tales of your childhood. From the moment you cross the threshold from the outside world to the charmed existence of life in the hotel you will find that you have truly been charmed and are leading a somewhat enchanted existence. Not only is there the magnificent casino to enjoy, there is also the wonderful pool, links golf, the castle walk for your shopping pleasure, and the midway where you can play all kinds of fun and exciting arcade and carnival games. Perhaps one of the most memorable and impressive of offerings is the Tournament of Kings dinner show. This show is offered nightly at 6:00 and 8:30 and you will eat in the manner of those in medieval times, without utensils while watching the evil wizard Mordred as he invades the evening festivities. This show is quite enjoyable and relies heavily upon audience participation. Dining in the hotel and casino can be quite the adventure without the assistance of horses and actors as there are several dining options including the Roundtable Buffet, The Steakhouse at Camelot, Regale Italian Eatery, Sherwood Forest Caf\u00e9, and how could we forget Sir Galahad's Pub and Prime Rib House? If you're looking for the fairytale wedding of your dreams, then Excalibur has the package for you. You can even elect to rent medieval costumes in which to get married.

Wedding packages vary in price from around $400 plus $55 for the cost of the minister to around $1575 plus the cost of the minister. These are all rather basic packages and do not include extras such as costume rentals, extra poses for the wedding photos, or video and candle services.

Our room at Excalibur was the \"standard\" room, not the refurbished one, which would have cost a lot more. We did however pay extra for a front room with a view. Our traveling companions stayed across the hall (no view of the strip), but they were happy with their room also. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. We didn't spend much time in our rooms. I mean, you don't go to Las Vegas to hang out in your room all day. I have only two minor complaints. 1. There was no tub. 2. The maids knock, unlock the door, and say \"housekeeping\" and walk in simultaneously. I got angry at the lady who nearly walked in me while I was getting dressed. She walked in on our friends across the hall too. To keep these people out keep the \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door at all times or lock the secondary lock on the door. Otherwise, the room and service from the HOTEL were great. We were even able to check in early at no extra cost. But, down in the casino and all the other casinos, there are these really obnoxious and pushy people who stand at the entrances and harass you in an attempt to get you to visit a time share place down the road. These hucksters are everywhere and you can't avoid them. You can, however, have fun with them. Since they don't know how to back off then you say \"no thanks,\" I tried other devices. One thing that's fun is to accuse them of hitting on you, then while they are trying to figure out what to say next, walk around them. My favorite line was \"Dude, I'm not interested, and can't you see that I am with my WIFE? Geez, go flirt with someone else.\" My other was \"Ma'am, I am happily married so you can take that nonsense somewhere else.\" Many said, \"Hey buddy, I can save you money on Vegas shows.\" To that, I responded, \"Sorry, I insist on paying full price for everything.\" But, there were times when I just got too tired to rebuff them politely, and I had to just yell \"GO AWAY!\" FOOD: The buffet at the Excalibur is really good. They have everything, but to save money, eat a late big breakfast because breakfast buffet is cheaper and then get dinner at the Sherwood Cafe. Between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., Sherwood Cafe serve a pretty good $7 steak. Just get the steak because a soda costs at least $2. Every casino has some special dish at a certain time of the day. You can save money by getting only the special and ordering water to drink. Most places have a cheap steak they sell. And, ask the locals where they eat. Locals usually suggest off-the-strip casino restaurants. BOOZE: If you're gambling, drinks are free, but tip your waitress a dollar. Otherwise, drinks are expensive if you're not gambling. To save money, get a bottle of liquor and some soda from the big store down the street and mix your own drinks in your room. Don't buy a bottle of liquor at the small hotel stores. It's mucho expensive. PARKING One more suggestion about Las Vegas -- put your car in Valet Parking whenever possible. All the good parking at the older casinos has been replaced with Valet Parking and all the free parking is way in the back. The parking at the newer casinos is even farther away. You most likely will have a few extra dollars on you when you visit the city so budget in $30 for tips for the valets. IT'S WORTH IT. I tipped according to how far they take the car and how far away the free parking is. At Circus Circus, valet parking is right out front so I tipped $2. At Caesar's Palace, I tipped $5. The next time we go, we will probably get some day passes for the tram. EXCALIBUR ENTERTAINMENT: We went to the Tournament of Kings Dinner Show in the basement. Our friends wanted to see it so they went on a time share tour. More on the tour later on. The show was really cheesy, but children would love it. It was very family friendly, but probably not appropriate for children under age 7 because of the simulated killing. But, even after each knight is \"killed,\" he jumps right back up ready to fight some more. FOOD AT THE SHOW: Dinner was tomato soup, game hen with french fries and broccoli served with a soda. Desert was apple turnovers. If you ask they will bring you silverware. Otherwise, you're supposed to eat with your hands. We opted for the silverware. BOOZE WITH MEAL: You can get beer or mixed drinks also, but anything other than the included sodas are really expensive. I think my martini was $9.50. NOTE ABOUT TIME SHARE TOUR: Our friends hated it, and they felt threatened by the people who were pressuring them the buy. But, if you're interested, our friends held out so long that the price dropped from around $40,000 with a $200 maintenance fee down to $6000 with a $48 maintenance fee. Think about it, if they are asking for $40,000 for a week, they are in essence trying to sell a condo for $2 million, and you're probably not going to ever get a $2 million room.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cExcalibur is OK\u201d", "Author": "GypsySueDenver", "ReviewID": "UR11691726", "Content": "We stayed here as part of a package we got through Southwest Airlines.

The non-smoking rooms are clean and even the 'non-view' rooms have a great view of the Nevada/Arizona mountains. The worst aspects? They don't keep your reservation, and their customer service. We had booked a fairly cheap package over the phone with Expedia and requested a non-smoking room (one of us have bad allergies). When we checked in, we were told that all of the non-smoking rooms were filled and we would have to sleep in a smoking room and transfer to a non-smoking room the next day. To try and sweeten it up, they upgraded us to a Deluxe Room for the night (the difference between the Standard and the Deluxe? A two person couch). Once we entered the room, it was clear that we could not stay there. In the half-hour it took for us to be transferred to another (smoking) room, the toilet had ran an average of fifteen times. The second room was worse, with a heavy hang of freshener in the air and a view of a wall (our previous view was of a spotlight). The front-desk for the hotel was very short with us, and not at all accommodating. Unlike other (fairly affordable) hotels where I've been in where they freak out if you don't have enough towels, the Front Desk took on the attitude of 'Well, there's nothing you can do about it so deal with it.' instead of 'How can we make it better?' and told us to come back to them after 12pm the next day. After calling Expedia to try and rectify the mistake, they tried to pin it on us saying we made no specification on whether or not we wanted a smoking or non-smoking room -- except our e-mailed itinerary said specifically 'Non-Smoking.' We were only in Vegas for two full days, and having to come back from breakfast to pack up and change rooms was very inconvenient on our time to sightsee. However, the second room had a great view of the Nevada mountains, was VERY clean and nice. The lady who helped us change rooms was apologetic and accommodating, even putting us on the 24th floor (we requested a room above the 5th floor for security concerns -- someone in the casino was screaming at our door since our room was in Tower 1 and the first room off the Casino floor). In short, we would probably stay at the Excalibur again. It's a no-frills type of hotel, where you stay if you know you're not going to be spending a lot of time in the room. The rooms are plain, the entertainment is fairly comical, but they do offer free lessons in the casino.

After reading several posts, I was somewhat cautious about staying at this hotel. KIDS ARE NOT A PROBLEM HERE! I had read that in many other posts, but when I was in Vegas, of course school was in, kids were not a problem. The major problem were all of the property pushers that will not leave you alone! I was stopped and/or bothered 5 times before I could even get to the elevator to my room! I did the upgrade to the new rooms with the plasma TV and was pleasantly surprised by how comfy and nice they are for the price. My first morning at this hotel; however, changed my mind rather quickly. After a long day of traveling, I looked forward to sleeping in a bit. Yeah, right. At 7:00am we were awakened by drilling, hammering and sawing. When we called down to complain, we were told that the construction was taking place on the 14 floor. It sounded like it was all around us! After a bit of complaining, we were given another room on the 22nd floor. Not that big of a deal, but moving was rather a pain. No offer of an upgrade or anything for our trouble. Overall I was happy with staying at this hotel, but be ready for some minor conflicts.

The excalibur theme doesn't quite work - in fact even back in the 90's when I first visited it looked tacky. Dick's bar recently opened is a bit full on and with it serving food to a whacky theme you get a lot of kids but it tries to be more raunchy with past patrons bras hanging from the bar - so you just leave the place confused as to whether it is trying to be a party bar for 20-30 year olds or a TGI Friday - avoid!. There is a lounge bar that when compared to things like Heart bar at planet hollywood or in fact any of the strip casino's bars is awful.

After finding a $138 round trip fare on Delta from Atlanta (not a typo), I arrived at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday. Below is a list of positive and negative aspects of the hotel for your reading pleasure. I will start with the negatives: 1. The front desk staff, while not rude, are certainly not pleasant. These folks really need some customer service training. It seems like they just know that their hotel is inferior and act the part. The manager Harley was nice though when I called to his attention the unacceptable rooms (see below). 2. Rooms are completely shabby and border on unacceptable. For instance, rock hard beds where the spring of the mattress is placed ever so nicely on your back. Also, the mold around the shower is just gross. It really reminds me of my college dorm room except there was no wierdo roommate at the Excalibur. I wonder what happened to him? 3. The hotel wants to charge you an additional $20/night to upgrade to a \"renovated\" room with a pillow top mattress and flat screen t.v. How about you just upgrade the guest for free if the room is available? The guest will be happy, gamble in your casino, and probably lose the $40 within about ten seconds at the blackjack table. 4. I was trying to take a brief nap after a game of poker and I was awoken by people swearing at each other outside my room. I opened the door and it was several housekeepers. I guess I would be mad too if I had to try to clean those rooms. 5. Annoying timeshare sales people hassle you as soon as you enter and leave the casino. If you have been to Vegas before you know what I mean. I suggest telling them you are late for your flight home. If that does not work, start following them around and asking them a bunch of questions about their personal life. Now for some positives: 1. Closest hotel on the strip to In and Out Burger. You must go - you must. 2. Very reasonably priced for a hotel on the strip with a good location - I paid $106 for a Saturday night and $46 for a Sunday night. For those prices, I really cannot complain too much. 3. Manager was nice and addressed my concerns about the room - put me in a somewhat nicer room which was closer to Holiday Inn quality than a Motel 6. 4. Krispy Kreme donuts and Starbucks on site. It is actually the cheapest cup of Starbucks coffee in Vegas hotels which I found -$2.60 a cup ($3.20 at Planet Hollywood). 5. Easy tram ride to Mandalay Bay. Go to Mix Bar at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay for the best view of Vegas 61 stories high. Get there before 10:00 p.m. and avoid paying at $30 cover. All in all, if you just want a place to sleep for a few hours and are not looking to impress anyone, this may be the hotel for you. If you want a better place to stay for a bit more money, I would suggest Paris, Luxor or Mirage. If you want further Vegas tips, please send me a message!

Previous complaints were regarding the unrenovated rooms in Tower 1 -- not a problem. The rooms are average; beds were reasonably comfy, pillows were soft, sheets clean and refreshed daily if desired. The bathroom was clean and bright and the shower was powerful enough (no tub for foot soaking after a long day of walking) and the carpet was reasonably clean. The hair blower was weak and the whole system fell right off the wall. We deliberately chose a low floor so we could have the option of taking the stairs if the elevators were extra busy but there was never a need to use the stairs. Security at the elevators was hit and miss; sometimes you needed to show your key, and other times not. The view from our room was definitely lacking but we were prepared for that by choosing a low floor. As others have mentioned, the buffet on the second floor was unappealing. Everything looked nicely presented but it all was very bland. For $12, you can likely have a better lunch/brunch elsewhere. Some reviewers talked about children all over the place. There is a children's arcade in the lower level of the hotel where I imagine you would find lots of children. I saw only a handful of children in the casino! Timeshare staff was another thing I did not look forward to but they seemed to be invisible. Perhaps because we were two women, we were ignored -- worked for me! Smoke in the casino is an issue for lots of people. I am a reformed smoker and did not find it overly offensive. The Hard Rock Casino had a worse problem than the Excalibur for smoke, I found. It goes without saying that you\u2019re gonna smell smoky anywhere in Vegas! Finding your way around the hotel is a bit of a problem but signs are plentiful and the internet kiosk at the concierge desk allows you to view a hotel map free of charge. (That kiosk is a poor excuse for internet access and charges an initial rate of $5 which allows 20 minutes of internet surfing. Each printed page uses $1 worth of your time. In other words, printing your boarding pass(es) costs $5.) Getting out and about and finding your way across the street is also little confusing and my feet suffered. But getting out and walking the strip is the best way to view Vegas! Take comfy shoes. The bus system on the strip is good -- $2 a ride or $5 for unlimited 24 hours use. The bus is, however, very slow negotiating the traffic on the strip. Of course, taxis are everywhere. A trip to the Premium Outlet Mall north of the strip was a $17 taxi fare from the hotel. The airport was about the same. The shuttle bus from the airport was $6 per person. We spent our last day in Vegas at the spa and pool area. It was unseasonably hot for mid-November and we soaked up the sun before returning to a Canada winter. I looked for a review mentioning the spa before leaving home but I could not find one. It was okay but not luxurious and prices were nearly comparable to home for all the services such as massages, wraps, facials, etc. The pool area was cement and unremarkable but new construction hints at a more contemporary area. Construction noise was minimal. I was told, however, that a room in Tower 2 overlooking the new pool area starts hearing construction noise at 5:30 AM! In summary, the hotel is definitely not as luxurious as many of the others but neither does it cost as much. As the old saying goes\u2026.. you get what you pay for.

On arrival at the hotel we did notice that the casino smelled a little bit strange \u2013 kind of musty overlaid with carpet freshener, but it was by no means awful and we got used to it quickly. We arrived at about 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was no queue for check-in. Throughout our stay, I never noticed any large queues, even though there were several conventions that week. We got our requested rooms (smoking) in a very short time. They put us on the same floor, just a few doors apart, which was great for us. We were happy with our standard rooms. The queen sized beds were definitely large enough for two people to share and the rooms themselves were bigger than we expected. The bathrooms were big too, with a lot of counter space for toiletries and a large mirror. They were well lit and very clean. The shower cubicle was huge, at least twice the size of a normal one. No baths, which wasn\u2019t a problem for us. There was no ledge in the shower for shampoo etc. which was a bit awkward but again not a major problem. All in all, we were very happy with our accommodation. The only gambling we did in the Excalibur was on the penny slots, but these seemed \u201cloose\u201d enough and we all made small wins throughout our stay. The exception was on the last night when one of our party won $160 on a five dollar roulette table, so that was a good finish. Cocktail service was okay \u2013 not great but not awful either. We ate twice at the Sherwood Forest caf\u00e9, once for lunch and once a very early breakfast (4.30am). The five dollar specials are good \u2013 I would recommend the breakfast. Getting seated was a bit slow, especially as the restaurant wasn\u2019t full, but service was efficient once we ordered. We ate at the buffet twice also, both times for breakfast. Food was good and worth the $11.99. There was a good variety and everything we got was hot and fresh. We also ate in the Italian restaurant in the hotel which was fine too. Nothing spectacular (wine list was quite bad) but not expensive and it was fine for our purposes. All in all it was a very enjoyable stay.

I simply asked for this at the time of check-in and the front desk easily accommodated us without any issue. As for check-in everything went very smooth. We arrived in Vegas at just after 12:00pm. By the time we made it to the hotel (took a shuttle from the airport) it was about 1:00pm. Even though official check-in isn't until 3:00pm they had no problem allowing us into the room early without charging us for an early check-in. And, again, the upgrade for an extra $20 per night was easily done\u2026and worth it! The room itself was very nice. Brand new bed that was very comfortable to sleep in. The furniture in the room was brand new and the 42\" plasma hanging on the wall was very nice...not that we did much television watching. The bathroom was completely new. Marble countertops with a full sized shower (not a bathtub/shower combo). The room smelled brand new like we were the first to stay in it. The casino itself is still very dated. Not near as modern as the others, but it is still very family oriented. We didn't do much gambling here so I can't comment on how the drink service was. The few times we sat at the slots we were always asked if we wanted drinks so I guess I can't complain. The location is great. This is probably the most redeeming quality of the Excalibur. Nearly every major casino/hotel is within walking distance. I can't say enough about the location. Saved us a ton of money on cab fare this year. The food is on par with what you might expect from a buffet. We ate the at the buffet twice. Once for breakfast and one for a late dinner. Both times we were satisfied with what we got. If your concerned with getting a good buffet I would suggest taking the free tram over to The Luxor. We did this once and were very impressed with it. You will pay quite a bit more, but the food was worth it. My only major hang up with this hotel is all of the timeshare people. I\u2019m sure the Excalibur has some type of deal with the timeshare companies to allow them in the hotel, but I felt as if I was running a gauntlet every time we went to the hotel room.

It got very tiresome very quickly. Saying \u201cNo\u201d to timeshare reps just became apart of our daily routine, unfortunately.

I've read complaints about people getting queen beds instead of king, smoking rooms instead of non-smoking and other problems. I didn't want to be another one to complain. Here's how I got what I wanted: I booked my room through \"last minute getaways\" on the AAA site. With their booking system it's impossible to specify your room selection so I went to the Excalibur website. There's an online Kings Express check-in there. A week before the vacation, I picked a non-smoking room with a king-size bed and a view of the strip. I also emailed stating my requests. Around noon on the day of the flight to Las Vegas, I called the King's Express helpline: 1(800)753-9773. The rep was very polite and helpful. I told her that I was concerned about getting the requested room because my boyfriend and I weren't arriving until after 9pm. She said, \"No problem, just make sure to give us a call if there's a delay.\" She also assured me that it was a really nice room on the 22nd floor. As Murphy's Law would have it, the out-going flight was delayed. I called the phone number I mentioned above and the rep said Excalibur would hold my room until 3am. I certainly hoped I wouldn't get it that late. I finally got on the plane, but after an hour of taxiing around the airport it returned to the gate because of mechanical problems (The airline was Ted by United and I'm not going to fly them again until they get the kinks worked out, it's a much longer story than I describe here and more happened on the return flight too). Eventually the whole flight got canceled, but I was able to get the another flight out. My boyfriend and I arrived at Excalibur well after midnight. The express check-in kiosks were down (which they seemed to be for the entire trip whenever we walked by reception). The line moved quickly to deal with the clerk though. The clerk was efficient (but I wouldn't call her overly friendly or rude). We went up to our room and walked out the elevator. The entire floor was designated non-smoking. Our room had absolutely no smoke smell. I opened the drapes and was met by a stunning view of the Luxor (I added a photo, trust me, it was huge and much more impressive in person). We stayed in Tower 1. It seems that the rooms with odd numbers from around 22105-22119 would probably have the same spectacular view. I could also open the window a little bit to get fresh air. It was very quiet and a haven after being on the busy strip. The carpet was clean (not sticky or dirty at all). My boyfriend and I were starving so we ate at the Sherwood Forest Cafe. There's a $5 special from 5pm-5am, but you have to eat in the cafe which can be a pain because the waiters are slow. Some are a bit surly and obviously don't enjoy their job, but others are very nice. For $5 you can get a great cheeseburger, a steak or a huge breakfast. Even take-out is slow in this place. Allow yourself extra time if you eat here. Everything else at Excalibur was fast and efficient except the cafe. As for the room, the king-size bed was comfortable and this wasn't one of the remodeled rooms. All the lights worked. The phone didn't so I let the front desk know the next day and it was replaced within an hour. They also waived the $1 a day phone fee. The TV worked fine and there's an express check-out service that you can do from the TV. There's some art with a medieval flavor like a knight giving a lady flowers. The only thing missing was a bathtub. I really needs a place to soak after walking around Vegas, but the shower was huge. Housekeeping was very friendly, but a bit questionable. The first day, everything was replaced and clean (there's a card in the bathroom that says to put dirty towels on the floor and to place the card on your pillow if you want new linens). The second time we had housekeeping, the shower mat disappeared and we found an empty pillow case on the chair. If you sleep in, prepare yourself to get a call from housekeeping. They'll call in the afternoon to ask if you need the them. They don't call early though. We got a call around 3 pm and at noon. Make sure to get a room on the upper floors. The lower floors have a monorail that goes past them. Also, you may have a view of a concrete wall. The first floor was missing a drink, vending machine and the machine on the second floor didn't work either. The vending machine drinks were less expensive than the same drinks sold at the stores on the ground level, so we frequented them. The casino was extremely smoky; just walking through there my clothes would reek. The only time it wasn't too smoky was at 2am on a Monday. Hint: If you need fresh air and you're on the strip, be sure to visit the animal habitat at The Flamingo. It's huge, free and very relaxing. The wild birds are beautiful and plentiful too. One of the best things about Excalibur is its location. There's a small, shopping area above the casino that has a Starbuck's, Krispy Kreme and a couple other chains. There's a walkway to the Luxor which also connects to Mandalay Bay. On the other side of Excalibur you can walk a bridge to NYNY or the MGM Grand. I visited the game arcade at both Excalibur and Luxor. The one at Excalibur is definitely aimed at little kids under 10. If you're feeling nostalgic, The Luxor had better games (there's a Simpson's Pinball Game and an F-Zero console). I really enjoyed my stay at Excalibur. It can be a great experience, but you have to make sure to ask for what you want.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExpected More!!!\u201d", "Author": "Washy10", "ReviewID": "UR10253568", "Content": "Decided to stay here as my daughter 4years old wanted to stay in a castle, the staff were very friendly and helpful and check in and out very easy, the only real complaint was house keeping we decided to upgrade our room for an extra $20.00 a night to have a room with the same views only 2 floors higher and a flat screen TV had had bad reception, the room was dirty stuff left all over the floor from the previous guests, dirty cups left in the draws that hadn't been checked, we asked for extra pillows and towels the first night we arrived and it took 3 DAYS to get them, with that all said they did not charge us for the room upgrade which was nice and on about day 4 they cleaned the room properly.

My husband and I decided to pay an extra $30 a night for an upgrade to a remodelled room which we thought was well worth the extra money. We had an in room safety deposit box (which we much prefer rather than having to go down to reception all the time) and we had a lovely view of the NYNY and MGM hotels.The room was clean and towels were changed everyday and toiletries were replaced when needed.There was no bath but that didn't bother us as we prefer a shower anyway and it was a good powerful shower.

We ate most mornings in the snack bar (Little John's i think) which was fine.A bowl of cereal and some toast was just enough to set us up for the day. We also ate at Robin Hood a few times but we felt that it wasn't as nice there as when we've been on other visits. It was convenient if you don't want to go too far for food but we think the Pyramid Cafe in the Luxor is much nicer (huge portions there). Sometimes we just had a snack from the food court which is very convenient. I had a small sub from Quizno's one day and it was gorgeous.We didn't bother with Dick's Last Resort as it's not really our kind of place but it always seemed to be busy (we weren't impressed when we saw a couple trying to get in there with a baby that only looked a few weeks old). I enjoyed playing the slot machines (only the 2cent ones) and there were always cocktail waitresses around so we didn't have any problems getting a drink. A lot of people say that the hotel is full of kids,it's old, dated etc well we didn't see any more children there than at any other hotel in Vegas and yes it is an older property but it's only somewhere to sleep so for us it was perfect (including the location).We will definitely stay there next time we go back to Vegas.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cGreat family hotel and recommend if on a budget\u201d", "Author": "Natz76", "ReviewID": "UR10105992", "Content": "We had stayed for two nights at the luxurious Mandalay Bay (see other review) but as we were in Vegas for 5 nights, wanted to make sure we did as much as possible so moved hotels for the other 3 nights. We chose the Excalibur for price and location and it was excellent. The decor was dated and needs an overhaul but who cares? The Camelot theme was great, families especially would appreciate. We stayed in Tower 2 which is very convenient for the pool area. The rooms were a decent size and very clean, we had a double bed which was comfy. The bathrooms were basic, no bath but large shower and very clean. The pool area was nice, lots of sun loungers available but the music they play is very loud so try and position yourself on the left side of the pool where there's a temp fence as they're building another pool area next door. There's no speakers on the temp fence so you can listen to your ipod in peace! The hotel is massive and we made use of the free monorail to Mandalay bay and Luxor. Food - we only ate at the buffet restaurant, can highly recommend the lunch/dinner buffets there with a full range of salads, roast dinners, pasta & Italian, Mexican and Chinese food. Lots of puddings too and of course unlimited drinks (as everywhere in Vegas). We had breakfast at the Robin Hood cafe which was excellent, there's a bit of a queue but if you are a small party and ask to sit at the counter rather than wait for a table you bounce the queue!. Hotel is in a great location with a walk way to New York New York (a fantastic hotel - check out the Big Apple bar and the excellent Chinese restaurant there). Would recommend Excalibur for the price. Only downside was the annoying timeshare sellers who accost you as soon as you walk in the door.

Nothing fancy but then we use the room for sleeping only. Each visit has found at least one lightbulb out in the room and it is usually on my side of the bed. This year we upgraded and got the jacuzzi suite - the extra cost to upgrade definitely wasn't worth it. Enjoying the jacuzzi at the end of a day is great but for what the cost of the upgrade was we could have just gone to the spa instead and saved a ton of money. This room is the same as any other room with a view in the decor dept. - just had a jacuzzi in the corner and you're not able to see out anywhere except into your room due to the location - we were hoping that at least we could look over the strip while enjoying the tub but a peak at the turret was the best we could do. Next time I'll just take a regular room and save money. We rented a car which is the only way to get around and enjoy the sites and other hotels. The valet service at the Excalibur is excellent - so friendly and quick. We experienced valets at a couple of the other hotels that we visited and the Excalibur definitely had the best valets. We played the tables and slots but found only a couple of dealers that we really liked - we had a hard time understanding most of them and they weren't the friendliest of people-standoffish. But we really did enjoy the couple of dealers that were so friendly and helpful. Wish they were all like that. Overall, if you're looking for a value priced hotel the Excalibur is good for this.

I probably would have been on the safe side and booked a room at Bally's if we'd been staying for a weekend or more. Since we were only staying one night and just needed a bed and place to shower/get ready/keep our clothes, the Excalibur was cheaper than Bally's or the Imperial Palace, but a step up from the Sahara/Stratosphere/Circus Circus (which were way cheap but also had horrible reviews and were too far down the strip). I wasn't disappointed in anything about Excalibur, in fact I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to stay there. It ended up being a great choice. We did call-ahead check in and our keys were waiting in a self-check in kiosk to the side of the line to check in with the staff (which wasn\u2019t horribly long, btw, at 3:00 on a Friday). We got a room in Tower 1 (though we hadn't requested a tower room), and it was non-smoking with 2 queen beds just as we had requested when my friend booked the room on the hotel's website. We called the hotel before we booked to compare rates and ensure that we didn't have to do anything special to get the 2 beds, and that's when they told us about the check in over the phone and gave us a number to call. When we called to check in, they just asked about what time we'd be arriving (we called at noon, said we would arrive about 2:30), and how many beds we wanted. Checking out was just as simple, all we did was drop our keys in a box not far from elevator to the tower. Everyone should do this, it's a breeze! The only interaction we had with the reservations staff was over the phone, and it was always professional. I don't know if our room had been renovated or not, though it was nothing fancy, it was nice enough and clean, with plenty of space, enough for two couples. The hotel itself is a little generic but the rooms didn't seem run-down, nothing was worn out. I read complaints that the bathroom was small, but I didn't think so. The stand-up shower could have fit two people, and the sink/counter had enough room for all of us to set our stuff out. Free TV channels, an iron and ironing board, small table, good lighting in the bathroom and a second mirror above the dresser. The bed was comfortable, but I did bring my own pillows. I suppose the a/c unit might be considered loud by some people. I\u2019m one of those who absolutely can\u2019t sleep in dead silence and always has to have a fan, so I was extremely relieved and happy that I could set it to \u201cfan only\u201d for noise. No coffee maker in the room would be the only thing lacking, I guess. But there are two Starbucks in the casino, and a McDonald's, or you might be able to get coffee from a cocktail waitress, if you're on that tight of a budget! The purpose of the visit wasn't to hang out in the room, of course, the couple we were with didn't even end up sleeping. The Excalibur was perfect because it's convenient to most places, so each person could go back to the room when they were ready. Excalibur is connected to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, and there is a bridge to New York New York, where they have several food places. It\u2019s at the very south end of the Strip, but we still walked and gambled at the Casino Royale, Harrah's, and the Flamingo. We passed by the Imperial Palace and just looking at the entrance to the parking garage, I was glad we didn't stay there. It faces the strip and people trying to pull in had to wait for an endless stream of pedestrians on the sidewalk, it looked very risky. Valet at the Excalibur was simple as could be, they were very nice as well. When we realized we forgot our cel phone in the car about 20 minutes after arriving, they asked what it looked like, where it was in the car, asked me to point out my keys, and went and got the phone for us, in less than five minutes. Same ease with check out, too. We wanted to stay for a bit after check out to watch football and gamble some more. They pulled the car up so we could put our bags in (I didn't trust the bag storage, no particular reason, I'm just a cautious person with my things), and re-parked the car. All it takes is a few dollars for tips. We stayed on a Friday and checked out on a Saturday. The casino seemed a little busier as we were leaving, but I think if you do the self-check in/out thing, you'll be fine. Don't be afraid of the bad reviews, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the Excalibur if all you want is a simple room at a decent price.

I wanted to stay at the Imperial Palace, where I had stayed before (I want a hotel on the Strip, where the action is, which doesn't cost a lot), but couldn't get it. Instead, I stayed at the Excalibur. It's south of the main action, but you can walk or take the bus. In Las Vegas, there are a lot of beggers, as opposed to New York. Should have some lose bills on hand. These people have a hard life. The Excalibur rooms are quite nice, and one feature above the Imperial Palace is that they check who you are before you go up the elevators. Makes you feel safe. They don't do that at the Imperial. When I visit Las Vegas again, it's a toss-up between Excalibur or Imperial. I'd rather spend my money on shows than just a place to sleep. I think the Buffet at Excalibur is better than Imperial, but I last visited the Imperial in 2004. For taste, the best buffet is at Paris. Costs more, but worth it.

This is a family-type hotel, slightly run down and DEFINITELY aimed at people who are willing to accept second best. You know it, the minute you walk in the front door. It does offer good value for money ( for a hotel on the strip) but I would recommend spending a few more dollars and booking into a better hotel. However if you are young, or travelling with young children, (and you believe that the dangers of passive smoking are greatly exaggerated ) then this just might be the ideal hotel for you. Because from the minute you check in, you are breathing other people's cigarette smoke. Apparently it is legal ( almost obligatory) to smoke cigarettes in casinos, and the whole of the ground floor is, of course, one big casino. The very walls seem to be ingrained with 20 years worth of cigarette smoke. I was surprised to see people with children- even babies- walking through this at all hours. One of the dubious attractions of this casino ( through which you must pass every day) is, apparently , a noisy bar called \"Dick's last resort\" where people are encouraged to whoop, holler and ( for reasons unclear) wear paper hats . This is a very noisy bar and the floor is covered with torn up paper. I never did find out why. This bar was full of people who in the UK we would describe as \"chavs\", -and fair play to them. But the American version is much noisier . Okay, here's what happened. 24 hours before we left the UK I phoned the hotel and confirmed the booking- a double widescreen non smoking room in tower 2. We arrived at 11 pm to be told by a very flustered clerk - whose english wasn't too good- that allegedly our room was NOT available and we would have to go into an unrefurbished \"smoking\" room for 2 nights. Personally, I think he was trying to extort cash ( a bung?) from us. But after travelling for 24 hours I couldn't be bothered with his nonsense so we stayed in an unrefurbished room for the first 2 nights of start of the holiday. The toilet was flushing continually and we phoned for the repair man. He stopped it but it started again the next time we used it. That night the toilet overflowed and the sewage ran out into the room, soaking the carpet. It turned out it was the toilet NEXT DOOR which was blocked. Also the next day, I heard a gurgling noise from the bathroom sink and I discovered the sink had ysteriously filled itself with delightful brown, cigarette- scented water. Also from next door, allegedly. The toilet extract didn't work and - most worrying of all- the window could be slid FULLY OPEN which isn't so clever when you are on the 14th floor. Admittedly the refurbished rooms are much better. They are of an acceptable standard. And if you enjoy waking to the sound of ambulances and grey haired old men on harley davidsons, remember to choose a room at the FRONT of the hotel. I would highly recommend that you ONLY stay in the refurbished rooms, even if it means paying a bribe for the priviledge. The Excalibur is an innovative hotelier. They allow new guests to check into rooms which are still uncleaned and with unmade beds from the previous occupants. I saw on three separate occasions , people at the reception complaining about this. There are quite a few different places where you can eat in this hotel. The most popular is a buffet where you can eat \"as much as you want\" but there are also some nice restaurants with friendly staff. In fact the staff are, in general, very pleasant to deal with. I have read suggestions on here that the negative reviews are being posted by rival hotels. I am a real person from the UK and if you want to know any more about the excalibur, feel free to email me.

The security guards present by the 1st floor elevators were extremely pleasant and made us feel quite safe inspite of the huge influx of college students on break. The kid friendly amusement area in the basement level is patheically old and dirty. So dirty it's scarey. With so many college aged (mostly drunk) kids present, the casino catered to them no end. Bleachers were set up so they could watch and wager on the NCAA basketball games and when they chose to take chairs away from slot machines in the casino no one stopped them. They were scarey. The facility itself is outdated and dirty inspite of continual cleaning, smokey and generally not worth 1 penny of what we spent there. In the past we have stayed at hotel/casinos near midstrip and been much,much happier in every way eventhough spending more $$$-$$$$.

Some background: my husband and I came to Las Vegas for the wedding of my brother and to renew our vows at the Canterbury Wedding chapel which is inside the hotel itself. The chapel should be excluded from most of the negative parts of this review, as they treated us very well, and both my brother's wedding and our ceremony were very nice. We received the chapel rate for our stay (Saturday-Tuesday) because of the ceremonies. When we arrived on Saturday and got the keys to our first room we went upstairs only to find the beds were unmade, there were wet towels on the floor in the bathroom and the TV was on. I hope that whoever was actually in that room wasn't planning on coming back, as their keys would no longer work. I went back to the front desk and got keys to the second room. This one had a charming view of a brick wall and a porta-potty, a hole in the alcove wall and the carpet was ripped in several places. ANOTHER trip down to the front desk was required. It should be noted that we paid extra for a view of the strip, which is an upgrade. When I went to the desk the third time I was told that I would have to pay for a view (even though I had). I explained that the rate we paid was for a view room, and finally got keys to a suitable room on the 23rd floor of Tower 1. We didn't get the single king we wanted though. We enjoyed our time in the hotel, and purchased some souveniers from some of the vendors. Our ceremony was beautiful and we had dinner afterwards in the Camelot steakhouse which was excellent!!! We didn't enjoy eating at the buffet for Monday morning breakfast. It was expensive ($11/person), crowded, badly set up and noisy. We used the salon for some of the women in the wedding party and it, too, is incredibly overpriced. $55 for a wash and blow dry that looked pretty average. Again, my brother's wedding was very nice at the chapel, and the dinner at Ragale was to DIE FOR!! Excellent food in every way for all the guests. After dinner, my husband and I decided that we wanted to stay in town for another day to be with my family. I called the front desk to find out what the stay-over rate would be and was put on hold for 5 full minutes before a snippy front desk clerk told me that it would be $136 and that the chapel rate would no longer apply. Keep in mind that our ceremony was $395, my brother's was $650, the check in the salon was $400, our dinner after our ceremony was $100, the check at Regale was $1700, and all told our party probably lost about $1000 gambling in the Excalibur casino. I was asking to stay over on a Tuesday night in late September and was asking for a rate that was only $50 less. I called and spoke to a manager who told the the best they could do was $101. Needless to say, we're not staying over. My family was one of the first to stay at the Excalibur when it was built in 1991. Back then, the staff was friendly, the attractions fun, the accomdations comfortable, and the amenities reasonably priced. Now, there's surly front desk people, rock hard beds, doors that don't stay shut without the deadbolt, overpriced services and no effort on ANYONE's part to make a stay pleasant. I'm certain that it's possible to enjoy one's stay at Excaliber, but if people do, it's in spite of the hotel rather than because of it.

My husband even tipped the guy. When we got to our room, it didn't appear to be upgraded at all and the view was of an air conditioning unit on the roof.

Playing at least $10 at the bar in video poker keeps you with as many drinks as often as you want. And the bartenders are very nice, and great to chat with. And then there is everything else. Booked an upgraded king sized room and ended up with 2 queens. Okay, fine. I suppose it's \"busy\" on a Sunday night... But the room was not only unclean (shower not clean, tables sticky, etc), but there was VOMIT all over the room. On doors, ceilings (yes, it was on the ceiling), walls, stained on bedspreads... everywhere. Yet when we called to ask for a change-- They didn't seem too thrilled to send us to a clean room. When we finally got to another room, we noticed our \"nonsmoking\" room reeked of cigarettes, had a broken lamp, was steaming hot, and no soap (we never got soap in our room the entire stay. Thank goodness we brought our own products). But since we were tired, aggrivated, and unwilling to move again we opened the window for some \"fresh\" air and tried to air it out. Thank goodness for the Downey Wrinkle release spray and some scented candles... it's the only thing that made the room stink bearable. And then there was the AC-- It never kept a constant temprature. Just on freezing cold and full blast directed towards the bed (brrrr) or off and hot as... But wait, there's more! I dared to walk around the room without socks! And as a reward I got punctured with what I thought might be broken glass. But no... it was only somebody else's nail clippings. Gross, huh? From check-in to check-out, I was astounded by the lack of compassion and customer service skills demonstrated by everybody from the bell staff (who never once showed up to help with baggage) to maids, to security, to cocktail waitresses, on up to the supervisor I spoke to (had to wait an extra 20 minutes while checking out to speak to her). You know, when I mentioned the fingernail clippings, she said that it happened all the time and then chastized me when I told her I cleaned up the mess instead of leaving it there for them to \"document.\" For my trouble they offered to comp me breakfast (this was after I mentioned I was on my way to the airport). Wow, thanks. I would have preferred that things be clean and I be treated with respect. I guess what bothered me the most was that I actually stayed here a month ago (during the weekend when the hotel appeared to be twice as busy) and my experience during that time was completely different. In fact, when they heard I was going to be back a couple weeks later, they told me that they would make sure my next stay would be great and they would give me upgrades and food comps, and to just remind them and my next check-in. Of course, that never happend (during my check in this time the guy asked me three times if I had stayed there before, and then told me that I would have to pay for the upgrades that I had been promised for free before). I have the feeling that I lucked out the first time and that makes me sad, because I wanted to give the place a chance. Like I said in the title-- There are so many hotels and hotel rooms in Las Vegas, that it would be a waste to spend your money here.

I honestly think you could just stay in the hotel for a week and never get bored! Of course, there is nothing like this hotel in Australia (the look of it, the theme, decor... everything!) so we were totally blown away from the start. I will try and keep an order to the info I review the hotel on. Ok, check-in. Check in was fast and easy and we only needed to give them a $5 deposit for the phone. The lady who checked us in was really nice and also gave us a map of the hotel. Finding our way to our room was interesting (the place was huge!) even with a map, but staff were helpful and pointed us in the right direction. When we reached the room we were very pleased with the size of it. We had 2 Double beds, a very big bathroom, table with 2 chairs and plenty of room for our stuff. The room has a great theme, people say it's outdated, but I loved it... I thought it added to the theme of the hotel. We also were lucky enough to have a view of the NY NY rollercoaster across the road. The room had air-conditioning, pay TV and a nice assortment of toiletries provided. There is obviously, heaps of gaming machines although we didn't really play in the casino. If you go downstairs you will find \"Fantasy Fare\" where there is lots of kids skill games etc and also the Tournament of Knights dinner show. Up a level from the casino is the food court where they have Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Krispy Kreme donuts (OH MY GOD!!! SO GOOD!) Starbucks, Cold Stone Ice-Creamery and more. There is also the Excalibur buffet (very reasonably priced!) The Thunder From Downunder showroom, Octane bar and a moving walkway to the Luxor hotel. The buffet we had at Excalibur was really good, heaps of selection and reasonably priced. We also saw the Thunder From Down Under show which was hilarious to say the least. On the casino level there is a place called \"Dick's Last Resort\" which is a great place to eat/drink. They have HUGE $14 drinks here in a souvenir cup (see my photos) and yummy food as well. There is also a snack bar called \"Little Johns'\" for if you get the munchies. As I mentioned before, there is a moving walkway to the Luxor hotel, so it is easy to explore this hotel too. There is also a walkway to the NY NY hotel and from there, another walkway to MGM Grand. From MGM Grand you can get the Deuce bus ($5 for a day pass) which stops at all of the hotels on the strip as well as downtown. On the food court level there are lots of shops, Excalibur themed souvenirs, LV stuff and a $10 boutique with lots of handbags and jewellery. I was very impressed with the service of Lost & Found at the Excalibur too. When I arrived into San Francisco airport I realised I had left my digital camera in the room at Excalibur. I called the hotel and they located the camera. As I didn't have credit card details available I had to call Excalibur when I got back to Australia. The lady then took my credit card details and the camera arrived at my house in Brisbane one week later, very securely packed and protected. I loved this hotel and would definately consider staying there again if I get to head back to Vegas one day. I would definately reccomend it to anyone heading to Vegas for a short or long stay.

The air conditioner is still the noisey kind although kept the room cool. The blanket, was a thin piece of material and no extra expense was spent on the bedding or the comforter.

They had little black hairs all over the bed, which only continued into the bathroom. Ugh. I couldn't take my shoes off, even in the shower. The casino staff was hit or miss.

These dealers can really make or break your experience. Unfortunately, many of the Excalibur dealers break it. I'm so disappointed with this experience.

The hotel is very clean and check in and out was swift. We had a tower 2 room, which had 2 queen beds, TV with basic US channels, a small dining table and 2 chairs. The bathroom had a twin shower with single basin and a noisy extractor fan (which can be separately turned off). Ice and cold drinks are on every floor located to the other side of the elevators. Despite being on floor 12 the lifts were incredibly swift. We ate in the Camelot Steakhouse, it was very nice but over priced in my mind. We had the breakfast buffet, which was good value for money. There was also a wide range of other outlets (McD, Quizinos, Krispy Kreme) but make sure you pay a trip to Cold Stone Icre Creams - boy amazing. Now to the downsides about Excalibur. The pool extension is not yet complete and is not only an eyesore but very noisy and a dusty. Pool drinks are overpriced and the sun loungers are packed in closer than sardines. Other things to do - well Lake Mead Cruise and Hoover Dam tour is amazing for $75 though despite what the tour company tells you is a 8.30 til 5pm day tour. We also flew to Grand Canyon South - which was awesome. We loved New York New York - especially the Guiness in Nine Fine Irish Men and the Daily meal specials in America (Salad, rib eye stea, potato and veg $15) - well worth it. We also went the the Factory Outlet South - $15 in a taxi and we bought Nike trainers for $19, Timberland shoes for $38 etc amazing savings. Though watch excess luggage on the way home they charge $16 per kilo and are ruthless. The monorail at MGM Grand is cheap at $9 for a 24hr pass and saves walking. If you are flying via Airtours dont bank on eating plenty - take some snacks as the meals are terrible (1 meal and 1 snack outbound). Timeshare touts are in the hotel - as the hotel is marketing its own property. We were got on our arrival by the staff starting a converation about where we were from and offering us a gift. Go if you wish, but be prepared for very hard sell. Also barter with the staff when they offer you things as you can up them from their standard offer. We went - beware we were there 4 hours!!

They were very accommodating to my party. They called a week before our check in date (Aug 3-5) to see who was in our party and to put us all on the same floor. Since we were using their wedding chapel, we were allowed to check in the VIP area. It wasn't necessary though, family in line at regular check in were done when I was. Which was good since we were all checking in about an hour early. 5 minutes tops. My father had knee surgery and needed a room closer to the elevator, they happily obliged and even upgraded him for free to a view of New York, New York and it's roller coaster. Rooms were clean and as described only two complaints. 1) My room door stuck a lot. It was the hardest door to open, I had to put my weight against the door every time I opened it and 2) their is a ceiling lamp above the table and chairs that is WAY too low. EVERYONE that sat in the chair under the lamp, hit their head when they were getting up (it was like this in all the new rooms). There was supposed to be security in front of the elevators to the rooms but a majority of the time, no one was there. When someone was there, they didn't check keys. Not a big problem to me because I had family and friends staying somewhere else that were often coming to our rooms. There were two pools, one had a slide. Personally, I find the \"open\" policy of drinking and smoking in the pool disgusting. The pool was packed with people lining the sides of it doing such activities, which resulted in their trash floating around the pool. The pool hours were 8 AM - 8PM, Vegas is hot 24 hours during the summer. It's not even dark when they closed the pool, most hotels I've stayed at stay open until 10 or 11 PM. The buffet was bland and a waste of money. The food court had a lot of options (McDonalds, Quizno's, Krispy Kreme, Cold Stones, etc) and that was great for a quick food break. Didn't try any of the other restaurants. The chapel was gorgeous and performed a wonderful ceremony. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a real ceremony on a budget in Vegas not a cheesy one.

The staff were all very accommodating, and any problems (for example, we had a loose toilet seat) were fixed promptly. We were on an American Airlines package, and we upgraded to one of the new rooms with the 42\" TV for an additional $20 per night. My wife actually upgraded over the phone before we left. The check-in line was long, but moved quickly, and they had our upgrade set when we checked in. The room was very nice - my only complaint was that there is no coffee in the room! (My wife reminded me I have complained about this at every hotel I've visited in Vegas - I'm usually there for meetings.) There was a coffee stand at the bottom of the elevators, so it was available but it was not cheap. There was also a $$tarbucks and a Krispy-Kreme in the hotel for other coffee options. I had to double up on pillows because they were very soft. That solved the problem, so I never bothered to call and see if firmer pillows were available. The food court has a McDonalds which seems to be the only place in Vegas that does not gouge tourists - the prices seemed about the same as a \"real\" McDonalds. Skip the buffet - it was not very good. It actually met my expectations which were very low. My wife was not impressed. There are better ways to spend your food money. Room service is outrageous, but it is 24/7. When a grilled cheese sandwich with fries is over $10, you're in a danger zone. We had a grilled cheese, nachos, an apple cobbler with ice cream and two ice teas and it was a $42 bill. It was two in the morning, so that's almost (but still not) forgivable. I would consider it highway robbery, but the Strip is not a highway. The prime rib in Sir Galahad's Pub was very tasty and the wait staff there was very good, as well. We ended up in the Pub because the main restaurant was closed the evening we went. There are a lot of families (including people pushing strollers around) there, although that probably has more to do with the rates than the castle theme. I do not understand why anyone would think bringing children to Vegas makes any sense at all, but that is more a general issue than a problem with the hotel. There are children out and about, but for the most part, they are under control. They're not supposed to be in the casino (I think) but you will see them, so if you're really allergic to kids, you probably want to go somewhere else, although, again, it's a city issue (from an old marketing campaign), not a hotel issue. I do think you will go broke with your children unless you just eat in the food court all the time, which is where you see a lot of families. Some of the patrons do look like they're using gambling as an investment program, so if you want to hob-knob with the upper crust, this is not the place. I'm not sure there really is such a place in Vegas anymore. The hotel is a bit smoky (probably not too much more than other casinos) - I didn't notice it as much while walking around, but I did notice it in my clothes when I was changing at night. My wife is a reformed smoker and she complained about it in a couple of areas - especially the Sports Book and Keno area. I would stay here again. The package rates were good, the room was more than acceptable, and I liked the casino. My wife said she would go somewhere else, but it's more because she simply wants to stay in a different place (we visited ten casinos for meals or shows during our stay, so we saw a lot of variety) than because of problems with the hotel.", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel in a great location on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "krystennicole", "ReviewID": "UR8247435", "Content": "Stayed at Excalibur for a girls only weekend. 4 Friends shared a room at the New York New York but I wanted my own room close to the New York New York but that was cheaper. Excalibur was perfect because its just a short walk across the bridge to meet my friends. When I got to the hotel the lines were kind of long for check in so I used their handy check-in kiosk. Worked out great and I don't understand why no one else was using it because I got a room right away. Room was on the 3rd level in Tower II. Room was very clean. I did not get a very good view but I did not mind since sometimes strip views can be very noisy. I wasn't planning to spend much time in my room anyways. One great thing about Tower II is that you are close to their inexpensive food area. So right after I got to my room, I ran down and ordered a sandwich and brought it to my room to eat. Otherwise Excalibur is a large hotel to walk through-so its nice having something handy close by. Room decor was outdated but I didn't mind. It was very clean and the carpet was very clean which is shocking to find in cheaper hotels. Beds were comfortable and they provided extra pillows. Room is quite large and had a table and two chairs to eat at. Chairs were in need of replacement though. Ordered room service once and the food was very good and friendly bell guy. A little pricy but to be expected in Vegas. Ate a meal at the 24/7 Sherwood Forest Cafe and had good food and service.

They could have stayed at the Excalibur for the same amount but gotten two rooms so they wouldn't of had to share beds and one bathroom.

Arrived at 3.00pm through check in within 5-10 minutes, there are lots of self check in stations, but no one was using them. Reception staff were fine. Paid extra $20 to upgrade to Tower 2. Rooms were fantastic, I can\u2019t see how people complain about rooms in Tower 2, they are all new, you even get that new carpet smell when you step out of the elevator. The hotel is a bit smoky, but so are a lot of places, until the 21 century catches up with Vegas and they ban smoking in casinos, it\u2019s a fact you will encounter smoky places. Timeshare is not an issue, just shake your head or say no and they leave you alone, if you travel in Asia the timeshare people follow you down the road and grab your arm! Again this is not the only place that has timeshare people. New pool is a long way from being finished, but the other pools are open the one at the back attracts most of the kids, easy to get a sun lounger up to about 10.30, after that not impossible but a bit of juggling would be required. Didn\u2019t eat at any of the restaurants, however they were packed, so I can\u2019t see there being too much wrong with them. Went down to the Food Court for Starbucks and Krispy Kreeme (can\u2019t get them at home) most days, you need to be there by 8.30 or the queues are very long. Dicks Last Resort had recently opened in the hotel, this was a great place to eat and drink, very convenient to have one on the way out or in the hotel, and the Frozen Margaritas were good to take back to the room while you got changed. As stated in may other reviews the location is perfect, if you want to stay local you have Luxor, Mandalay Bay, NYNY and MGM all a few minutes walk (or tram). This was my 3rd trip to Vegas and 3rd different hotel, if I am lucky enough to get back again, it will be the Excalibur for me, I think it\u2019s a great balance between cost and services with all the advantages of the location.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cNice for the Price!\u201d", "Author": "MrHendu", "ReviewID": "UR8216273", "Content": "We (2 couples) booked our trip through Alaska Air Vacations.

The rooms were nice and we enjoyed the pool for a couple hours each day of our stay. The pool area was about halfway through a remodel but two large pools were open and distractions from the work were mininmal. We played blackjack, craps and slots and found the service to be comparable to other casinos. The only minor hiccup was one night our room key was not working and the front desk was not very helpful at the time.

Firstly can I say that I am Irish and it was my first time in America so everything excited me. I had already been to New York and San Fran but Vegas was number one... Absolutely loved it. From getting off the plane to getting back on it again I had the best time of my life. The Excalibur was perfect for me and my friends cause it was so so reasonable and we didn't have loads of money to splash around but I must say it was excellent. On the first day we visited the Spa which was beautiful and you felt more like you were in some far off exotic island rather that right in the middle of the hussle and bustle of Las Vegas. That showed me you really could have any kind of holiday you wanted here. Our room was large and clean. Nothing spectacular but you just have to look out the window and you get all that. I loved the poker in our hotel. At first I was nervous thinking at would be really serious but it wasn't. Well I'm sure you could find a serious game but not if you weren't up for it. The free drink was great,.....I know your thinking how irish am I.... but it was nice to be waited on while you sat around playing cards... Also the choice of food was great, anything you want basically at any time... Loved that! I can't even begin to explain it all but i'm trying to. What I really loved about our hotel is that it was right next to New York New York which is such a cool place with the best Pub i'v ever been to \" The Times Square Bar \" Best live music you could imagine. I'll sum up really with this, No one can tell you about how amazing Las Vegas is, you have to go there and see it all for your self. Otherwise your missing out big Time.

Yes, the price was \"cheaper\" than some hotels but as they say, you get what you pay for!. Our room didnt look like the floors had been vacuumed, and the \"view\" was primarily the airport unless I leaned against wall to see up strip. When I pay extra for a \"view room\" I expect to see the strip as advertised. We were never once asked how our stay was. We ordered room service twice as our feet were dead from the walking. Food was great, service was great...delivery was slow. Dont expect to see your food for at least an hour after ordering. our first room service cart sat outside room for 16 hrs before being picked up. The second time it sat in the hall for 36 hours and I feel the only reason it was picked up was we complained to security that it was crazy and a health hazard that there were six food carts in the hall that had been there for almost 36 hours. Dont know if staff was afraid of the 13th floor or what...and yes they have a floor #13. Also would not recommend gambling there as the children underfoot are ridiculous. Also seems the staff is either rude or doesnt speak english well. If you are wanting your \"free\" drinks while gambling play the tables as the cocktail people will fly past the slots. Would recommend the Tournament of Kings it was about the only good thing there. I dont know what Royalty they are talking about when they say you will get treated royally. If any royalty got treated like us they wouldve thrown the whole lot in the dungeons and forgot about them. Our \"king size\" bed was closer to a queen and practically sat on the floor. The mattress was so bad we had springs in our back the whole time. And as for the players club, dont bother unless you have a \"real credit card\", Since we used our Visa \"debit\" we were on cash only basis and the players club didnt get us comps. Also TV was fuzzy, and the high speed internet they advertise costs 10.99 a day and doesnt even work half the time and no refunds on if it doesnt work.

I didn't have a big problem waiting since we had the other two rooms, we just put our luggage in one of the rooms and began enjoying ourselves.

When I told the person at the front desk what I had previously been quoted he shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know why anyone quoted a time as they had until 5pm to have the rooms ready (normal check-in time is 3pm). So we went back to one of the rooms that we did have that adjoined the room that I would be checking into. At no time during that hour did we ever see housekeeping anywhere in the vicinity. At 5pm I returned to registration and was finally allowed to check-in. Upon opening the door to the room I found out why they wouldn't let me check in. The room, which was supposed to be non-smoking, smelled of cigarette smoke. We opened the window as far as we could and opened the doors but even by the following day it still smelled horribly. I should have complained but I simply bought a bottle of Febreeze which took care of the smell (although it required several applications). The upgrades were a definite improvement over the old rooms. Even the hallways on the upgraded floors were given a facelift. All and all though we weren't in the rooms much anyway.

Heard bad things about the timeshare people, but they do not hassle you as they do in Europe where they chase you down the street!! Just say no thanks and they leave you alone. Even though there is renovation at the pool we did not find it a problem and there are so many lifeguards we didnt worry about the our kids in the pool when we were relaxing. Dont forget to check out the \"Cheesecake Factory\" in Ceasers Palace. Excellent food and reasonably priced. A must is Mystere, Cirque De Soleil at TI, what a great show! If you have a chance go and take a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon, it was amazing. We went with Maverick Tours and we could not fault them!! Amazing!!

So just ask for a renovated room in Tower 2. I had a view of the freeway and pool (pretty small from the 24th floor). The entire floor was non-smoking, so no evidence of tobacco was found in the hallways or the room. The carpets and furnishings actually LOOKED new. The room itself had 4 lamps plus an overhead light in the hall. The flat screen TV was fine (no High Definition, though) and I never used the wired Internet access ($11.95 /night). The room was spacious with two well-padded chairs, a table and a long narrow dresser desktop under the TV. The individual digital temperature and fan-controlled air conditioning unit will fill any specific requirements. The bathroom had plenty of extra towels, shower stall only (but quite large) and was well lit with included hair dryer, magnifying mirror and the three shampoo/conditioner/lotion liquids (small containers). Note that there is a 'mandatory' one dollar phone charge per day for local calls, even if you never make any. I mean, whom do you know in Vegas anyway? The charge doesn't even include '411' directory assistance calls. Why can't they just add it to the room rate? Such are the vagarities of Vegas. Excalibur has games and souvenirs for kids, and there were lots of them (kids and souvenirs). The place is big enough, however, that their presence was only felt while I was navigating around the casino floor. As mentioned by other reviewers, the timeshare salespeople were hovering around the front and side entrances but it's easy to ignore them or go in the back entrance. If someone says to you \"Would you like a free show ticket?\", run away very quickly. Security was non-existent in our wing for all 4 days. Across from our entrance, the other side was manned constantly. I have no idea what the reason was -- a manpower shortage? There was a definite tobacco smell in the casino and the entire first floor, since smoking is allowed in the casino. The table minimums are lower than most of the strip hotels ($10 vs. $15 for BJ and Craps). The Video Poker was a poor 7-5, but most of the strip had this; I saw no better payoffs in the 4 casinos I visited. I never ate there, but in addition to the ubiquitous buffet, there were lots of fast food restaurants as well as upscale ones. In general, I feel that this hotel, though dated, is a great buy for the money, especially if you can grab a renovated room.

They moved us to a new set of rooms (we had 2 for our family) and there was also hair in those beds. My daughter called our travel agent back in Texas to see if we could be moved to another hotel but it would have cost us each approximately $400 per family to move and that was not feasible. We then demanded to talk to someone higher up and got the Assistant Manager of the hotel. Everything was going smoothly until she told me that she was afraid to put us in another room because we would probably find something wrong with that room too, she would just rather try and fix the problem. After all was said and done, we were moved to the \"newly remodeled\" rooms that faced the pool area. There was still some hair in the bathroom but by that time (we had been going through this for about 3 1/2 hours) I just got a washrag and washed the hair down the sink.

My stay at the Excalibur has been by far the worst. When first entering the Casino you are accosted by third party vendors to talk to them about a \"free gift.\" This of course is your typical Vegas \"free offer\" you don't need to spend you time with, and one would expect to find in Vegas. However I would not expect a casino to allow this to take place inside their hotel, it's more annoying than a telemarketer, especially when you' have your hands full with bags trying to make it to your room. This however is minor but reflects the managements focus on customer service. When we arrived in the room I went to use the bathroom only to find first the shower door hanging off by a broken hinge and most disturbingly that the previous guests had clogged up the toilet with foulness which I will not begin to describe here. Of course this meant that housekeeping either did not clean the toilet, did not call to have it fixed, or had created the \"mess\" themselves. Suffice to say I felt inclined to use the casino bathrooms after the one in our room was not fixed three hours and two calls after arriving at the hotel. I finally made a third call three hours after the first then went out for the evening in the hopes that when I returned it would be fixed. When I arrived back exhausted 8 hours later at 5 in the morning I found the bathroom in the same condition I left it. Pissed off but to exhausted to do anything about it at that hour I went to sleep. When I woke up a couple hours later I called again. After waiting a little while and having a need for the bathroom I decided that since I had to go downstairs to use one anyway I might as well have a discussion with management. On my way out \u201cengineering\u201d finally showed up, said it would take a while to fix, and that it was on record that I had called. My discussion with the assistant manager consisted of her telling me that they only had a record of one call, and that they had gone to the wrong room, 5221 instead of 15221. She seemed to blame me for not staying in my room until they got there and fixed the problem even after three calls. Here was the end result after talking to the assistant manager and calling the manager with no response. 1. Paying about $80 dollars for the first night (1/2 off, who cares) for a room without a functioning bathroom. 2. Having to pack all our stuff up move to another room, without the view I had specifically paid extra for and paying full price for the second night. This was their solution. Do not stay at the Excalibur\u2026 ever. P.S.

This being said, for people who are trying spend their money elsewhere other than on their room (which we spent time in to shower, sleep for a few, dress, drink and get out) this place will accommodate you to the fullest. We stayed in Tower II section of the hotel, and from what I was told, they were superior to that of the first tower. Our rooms were clean, staff was courteous and accommodating and the flat screen TV was great watching the NBA playoffs. After reading the reviews on trip advisor we were initially weary and went in expecting the worse. When I opened the door to the room, I was pleasantly surprised. I can say that there was a sigh of relief because I am used to staying in rated hotels whenever I travel on business or with my girl, and the Tower II rooms did not fail me. My party members were all in their mid to late 20\u2019s, so we spent all day walking the strip, talking to people and checking other hotels and casinos. It\u2019s situated in a great spot and the 5* hotels and restaurants are a hop, skip and a jump away.

We arrived at the hotel around 2pm and the checkin line was pretty long but it moved rather quickly. I had booked a view room through their website. When we got up to the counter my husband told the girl it was our anniversary and asked if we could be upgraded to one of the new widescreen rooms.

Comparing the 2 rooms/towers, it was basically staying at 2 separate properties. Saying that they need to get Tower 1 refurbished is a huge understatement. My Tower 2 room was nice, but not 5 star. It was well renovated with new furnishings including: carpets, marble/granite bathroom counter, curtains, wall decor, bedspread, pillows, lighting, widescreen TV, furniture. It looked and felt new, and clean, and that was pleasing. The look is 'similar' to the 'modern' look of, for example, THE Hotel at Mandalay. It's definitely not that level, but it is going that direction if that is the look they're trying for. I got improved sundries in the Tower 2 room versus basic small bars of soap in the Tower 1 room. The Tower 2 decor was a clear move away from the 'Medieval' theme that is prevalent in Tower 1. I think if Tower 1 was not so dilapidated, and the Medieval theme a bit more tasteful than schlocky, the Medieval theme would have been fun. There was always security checking for room keys from anyone entering Tower 2. On many occasions, no security was present checking for room keys at the entrance to Tower 1. Read into that what you want. The Excalibur is located on a great corner on the Strip, close (realistic walking distance) to other major Vegas resorts like the MGM Grand, NY-NY, Luxor, etc. Just because you can see something on the horizon, doesn't mean you should claim it's within walking distance. There was a convention or 2 in town that week, and it's unbelievable what rates were being charged for the Tower 1 room (almost $300). At that price the Tower 1 room is a very bad value. Given my unscientific experience of other Vegas rooms on the Strip over the last 2 years, I wouldn't pay more than $50/night (weekday rate) for a Tower 1 room. The Tower 2 rooms were more of course, but were no bargain either during this period. I would stay again at Excalibur if I could get the refurbished room for a good price.

My problems: 1) Nice refurb but the A/C is extremely loud - no matter how nice the room is, it doesn't matter when you're waking up everytime the [----] A/C turns on. 2) Noise - noise from the pool comes right up Tower II (newly upgraded) as long as the facility is open. Come to find out, the quality of music at the pool was pretty bad - how about more speakers and less volume, guys. We were on the TOP FLOOR. 3) Plasma TV with FEW channels, POOR reception, and slow channel-changing times. 4) NO COFFEE? You have to be kidding me. Super 8 gives you coffee. Oh, that's right. 2 Starbucks and a bunch of coffee kiosks line the casino. Nickle and diming customers is NOT my idea of good service. We won't be staying here again. For the price, you can do better. Use Priceline or Hotwire. Positives: 1) McDonald's open late? 2) $5 BJ tables 3) Linkage to Mandalay Bay and Luxor 4) You get to stay in a castle. The above negatives were dealbreakers for us. Less granite in the bathroom and paying more attention to detail (the A/C issue, for example, or the uselessness of putting in massive TVs that don't even function well) would significantly improve the new tower.

The first thing I noticed when I walked into the casino was the smoke. Being from New Jersey, where smoking is banned practically everywhere, this was an unpleasant surprise. (The reason I bring this up is that the newer hotels must have better ventilation systems because the smoke is not as prominent.) The second thing I noticed was the dated decor. If that's something that you think is very important, you'd be better off at Paris or Bellagio. Fortunately the smell did not permeate my non-smoking floor and I wasn't upset with the '70s vibe. I stayed in a no-frills room with a shower stall in Tower 1. I did have a nice view of Luxor's pyramid and Mandalay Bay. My friends were in Tower 2 and their room was refurbished with a flat-screen HD TV, granite countertop, new bed/linen and a crisper, more updated look. My understanding was the updated room cost $20 extra per night. Since I stayed 5 nights and wasn't in my room all that much, I stuck with the cheaper accommodations. Excalibur is definitely cheaper than many of the other hotels on the strip. However, its location isn't ideal. It's at the beginning of the strip, and most of the action is more in the middle - closer to Paris, Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, etc. The hotels are next to one another, but it's a very, very long walk, especially if you poke around inside each hotel, too. Vegas does have a tram service that runs between certain hotels, but I never saw many people using it. Taxi drivers, on the other hand, make out like bandits. The average cost for a one-way ride from Excalibur to Paris, etc., was $6-$8. A trip out to the Hilton, where the Star Trek Experience is located, cost us about $13. My advice?

I believe I had the most wonderful bed you could have inside a hotel.. Other than my own bed, this was the most comfortable bed I have yet to sleep on in my life.. The buffet was great, along with the staff. I did find it VERY HARD to hit on the machines though.. Didn't win a cent... I wasn't expecting to become a big winner though.. We saw Some Thunder From Down Under while at out hotel too, and it was amazing.. Loved it, and would recommed it along with this hotel for anyone.. Well, I wouldn't recommend the men to go watch the show lol... I only went in a few of the hotels, but took pictures of many of them... I went inside of The Luxor, The Mandalay Bay, New York, New York, MGM Grand, & The Tropicana.. MGM was an experience, but I loved The Mandalay Bay, and Ny, Ny.... I hope i've been of some help by posting this trip report. Please don't pay attention to these bad reviews.. They must have just lost really, really bad.. I did the same, but I still enjoyed my Vegas Experience.. This was my first, but not my last trip to Las Vegas... The Duece Buses are the Best.. They are big double decker buses, and you'll see bus stops around the hotels.. Only $5 bucks for a 24 hour pass.. The Excalibur is the bus on the South Side of the stip, along with all hotels on that same side.. The other side is the North Strip Bus, and they also have a Fremont St. Bus too... Well worth the money.. You go to the bus stop, and pay when you board the bus... I didn't get to see the Fountains or Volcoano do to VERY HIGH WINDS.. We were in Tower 1 on the 13th floor with a view of MGM Grand & Tropicana Hotels... When you go to the elevators to Tower 1, the elevators on the left go up to the 18th floor, and the elevators on the right go from 18th floor and up.. I figured i'd post this, cause I took the wrong elevator lol.. Free drinks in the Casino... If you plan on tipping, which I usually do, I wouldn't recommend tipping for a soda.. They are all ice with very little pop.. Water comes in small bottles, beer in regular bottles, and mixed drink in small glasses.. All of those are worth tipping, but not the soda in a glass... Inside the hotel, up on second level is the buffet place, thunder down under, several food chain resturants including mcdonalds, shops, etc.. Also, on this level, they have a walkway with rolling sidewalks to The Luxor... From this hotel, they also have a FREE TRAM SERVICE.. You can take this to The Luxor & Mandalay Bay.. Over across the streee at MGM Grand, you can purchase monrail passes, but I find the bus much better, and much cheaper!!! Enjoy The Excalibur, because I sure did... We booked the Grand Canyon tour, and it was awesome.. A must do for anyone... It is called The Grand Canyon South Rim Tour.. It only cost us $72 bucks each..

After staying at the Luxor last year and reading some negative reviews on here I was a bit dubious about our stay here but we coulndn't pass up such a good offer. Before we arrived in Vegas I actually emailed Excal and enquired about an upgrade to our room, the lady who emailed me and corresponded with me was most helpful and courteous. We upgraded to a Widescreen View room for an extra $35 per night. Arrived by taxi to Excal on April 25th around 3pm, we didn't bother checking our luggage with the bellboys as we only had 1 case each and I knew it would take a while for us to receive it in the room. The check in line was short and moved fast. The woman who checked us in was quiet but polite and confirmed with us that we had requested an upgraded room (good start). we were allocated Tower 2 22nd floor, room 31. Made our way through the casino to the lifts, getting accosted by timeshare touts on the way! (We had experienced them in 2006 so we knew to wave them off immediately) This was to be the first of many attempts of these people to try and get us \"free show tickets\". Three or four times a day we would have to pass them by to get to our room and they were a bit of a pain! Room was lovely, glad we upgraded. View of NY NY, side on to MGM and some of the strip. Huge shower in bathroom and nice large marble dresser area around the sink. Hairdryer was ok, not great (allow extra time girls for drying your hair!) Iron and ironing board and fair size wardrobe. Loads of drawer space and safe in cupboard. 40\" Philips lcd television mounted on wall. Huge kingsize bed (I say huge because in the UK a kingsize bed is nowhere close to this big!) Very comfortable mattress and pillows, we slept like logs the whole stay. Air conditioning was good, bit noisy but we didn't use it during the night as it was cooler weather during our stay. Maid kept the room very clean the whole time with fresh towels and bedding every day. We never saw any problems with room service trolleys being left in the hallways, although there were sometimes dirty glasses left in the lifts all day. The only trouble we encountered was in the early hours of Saturday morning after the Mayweather fight about 5am screaming shouting and arguing in the hallway, knocking on our door, girls crying... this went on for about 30 mins, quite annoying but this could happen in any hotel I guess. We played a bit in Excal, just on slots though so not sure what dealers are like, all looked friendly enough and there was always lots of tables having fun at all times of the day, especially at craps. We won a $500 about 1 hour after arriving here on VP so were happy with that. We did not get a chance to try out the pool, I hear that the original pool is open while they renovate a new pool are close by so there could be some noise/construction. We tried the breakfast buffet 3 times, it is ok, we found it hard to find much that we liked. In the UK it's not normal to eat chinese sweet and sour chicken for breakfast! Or fried chicken and country gravy! (Still not sure what that it!) I like to eat Eggs Benedict when I am in USA but at the buffet it was always cold, not nice. Champagne brunch on Sunday was nice, there is a huge range of salad stuff as well as breakfast items and a carvery table. We ate also at Sir Galahad pub one evening, I ordered a salad to start which was lovely but huge and I could not finish, my boyfriend had prawn cocktail.. now this looked lovely but the sauce was very spicy, he thought it would be thousand island like we use in UK but it wasn't and he thought the prawns would be like king prawns but they were more like langoustines, pretty big and chewy. Main course I had salmon, was very nice, boyfriend had roast beef which was 3 huge fairly thick slices with yorkshire pudding etc, he could not finish it all, said the meat was delicious though. We saw 2 guys at the table nest to us getting served the prime rib or sirloins... they were massive, about 3 inches thick and about 5 inches long, glad we didn't order that, we would have had no chance!! Bartenders were friendly and always asked us if we wanted another when we were playing VP at the bar, of course we always tipped too. I like the Excal because of the short walk through to the Luxor and Mandalay and it's good transport links. Bus stop for Deuce across the road and Monorail just 15 mins away at MGM. As for the kids things... yes there was a few kids there, never had a problem with them though, I suppose it depends what time of year you go.

I've been to Las Vegas a dozen times, but this was the first time I've stayed at Excalibur. I've always thought the Stratosphere was the best value on the strip, but the location of Excalibur is definitely better than Stratosphere. I booked my room through Southwest Vacations and the room rate averaged out to be around $127/night. This was for a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was very happy to find a decent place for that price. Check-in went smoothly. I arrived around 2pm and didn't have to wait in line at all. The desk agent, Soy, was very helpful in finding me a outer-facing room. The only one available was on the second floor. The view turned out to be not bad. My room faced the Luxor pyramid, but bright up-lighting outside kind of ruined the view at night. Oh well. My room was in tower 1, which is not the remodelled tower. But my room was spacious and very clean. The bed was comfortable and pillows were great. The only complaint about the room was that the air conditioner was VERY loud. And there was a lot of mechanical noise in general, but probably because I was on the second floor. The hallways always had some trash on the carpet, but no bad smells or anything too gross. The casino was actually pretty nice. If you haven't been to Excalibur in a while, it has gotten a lot better. There's still the castle theme everywhere, but they have made an effort to make it a little more classy. The casino was quite crowded over the weekend. Drink service was very good. Table limits start at $5/min. Plenty of slot choices. I did see a lot of people with kids, but mostly just passing through. I didn't eat at the Excalibur, but I did like that there were several Starbucks conveniently located around the place. There are coffee stands at the bottoms of the tower elevators, but if you don't want to wait 10-15 minutes just go up to the food court on the second floor and there's never any line at the Starbucks or Krispy Kreme.

The lady at the check-in desk was quite nice and helpful. We stayed on the 23rd floor in Tower 1. The room was nice; plenty of room, comfortable beds, etc. The bathroom was very spacious however it is also the subject of my one complaint. The bathroom had an odor to it. It wasn't strong and it wasn't awful, just a strange smell. Also the towels smelled like smoke. Other than that the room was fine. No problems with the maid service. We didn't have any problems with noise from the hallways like some previous reviewers stated. The casino was a little smokey, but it's a casino. What do you expect? Also the time share folks weren't bad. After we told the first guy we weren't interested, they left us alone for the rest of the trip. We ate once at the Sherwood Cafe. It's similar to an IHOP or Waffle House. The food wasn't bad and the prices were reasonable. While there we saw a manager bending over backwards trying to satisfy a woman who it appeared just like to hear herself complain. He really seemed to go above and beyond what should've been necessary and never once got the slightest bit upset with this crazy woman.

Otherwise is was a great room. The valet service was the WORST I have ever seen. Instead of the valet's TAKING cars out to park them and bringing up new cars, the valet's would go 2-3 to a car and then maybe see one come back with a car. Every valet in Vegas (and I've used NYNY, Paris, TI, Mirage, Cesaers, Tropicana and Stardust) run to get cars, not just stroll to the parking lot. This to me is a very bad point for the hotel.

The pool towels are shower towels but you can take 2 per person and that is enough to cover the chairs.

The pool staff could work a little harder at keeping the pool cleaned out from the construction stuff, was really in need of good vacuum job, but that is a management issue.

Everything in the room looked nice, the furnishings did not look worn, and everything worked fine. If you want something contemporary, look into a newer (and pricier) hotel. My only complaint is the time share people that try to snare you for their sales speil with the promise of free show or dinner tickets. They are in most of the other hotels as well. Keep Walking!!!

When I asked a friend to recommend a hotel our family with 2 younger children would enjoy she mentioned this one so I looked up the number and called. I was trying to ask the person on the reservation line about the room and facilities, but she was just interested in getting my credit card number. After we met with my in-laws we went downstairs to the arcade with the kids. Almost none of the games that needed a staff member were open. The games cost a fortune and did got give tickets to redeem for prizes. I asked an employee where the pool was and he told me which direction to go in. Along the way I asked another employee just to double check, she too pointed which way to go. It wasn't until I arrived at an empty concrete hole that I found out the pool was not in service. Needless to say the kids were not happy after the lack-luster trip to the arcade, a trip to the pool was just what they were waiting for. The next morning I expressed my unhappines with a staff member at the front desk. She pretty much told me I was lying about not being informed that the pool was being serviced. She went on and on about every member of the staff being aware of the situation. I was expecting some sort of appolgy or offer of a service, which never happend. She assured me she would speak to the person that made our reservation...but she didn't bother to ask my name or room number so I have a feeling that didn't happen. I asked for the service manager's name and number and called him. I explained the situation and he agreed to give me half off the first night stay. I was slightly satisfied.

We paid for an upgraded view and received a decent room with a great view, however, we had a small problem with the room that took over half our trip to get resolved, and the Excalibur staff were, overall, not pleasant to work with. The room was nice, not outstanding, the casino was pretty easy to navigate with a decent selection of games (missing some of our favorite), and the restaurants were average to slightly above average. Not our best, not our worst Las Vegas experience. If you want a little more details, here you go... We received an email offer from Excalibur that coincided with our annual trip to Las Vegas (I travel with a group from 4-12 people each year to a trade show, and I decide where we stay). Most in our group had not stayed at the Exclaibur, so I decided to stay there. I had an option to \"upgrade\" my view, so I did at a little more expense. We checked in without problem into Tower II, on a high floor. Our room was newly renovated, so everything was new. We had a nice sized flat-screen TV, the bathroom was decent, however it does not have a bathtub, only a shower. The bed was actually quite nice. However, our small window had a shade that was broken, making it impossible to look out the window. We immediately notified housekeeping and maintenance, receiving assurance that the problem would be quickly remedied. This turned out to be a much bigger problem than it should have been. It wasn't until the 3rd day (of our 4 night stay), that they finally fixed the problem. During that time, we made around 8 calls, and several trips to the front desk. With a few exceptions, we were treated as a nuisance, not a valued guest. Our only offer was to be moved to a (much) inferior room with no compensation. One desk person even claimed that we did not deserve a room with a view, despite the fact that I had paid more to be upgraded to a \"view\" room. We are not usually complainers, and will tolerate most things, but not being able to see the view in a room with a view bothered us. If you are a \"I'm only sleeping in the room, who cares about the view\" person, this won't make any sense to you, however, we really enjoy the view of Vegas and the surrounding hills, so it mattered to us. Being treated like pests was not something we were used to, and has left a bad taste in our mouth for the Excalibur. If you are still considering the Excalibur, we can give you this further information. -The buffet is a reasonable value. It is one of the lower price (not cheap) buffets, and gives decent value for the money, but it is not a \"special\" Las Vegas buffet. -The Italian restaurant in the hotel offered a very good meal, with disinterested service, the price was reasonable, the atmosphere was subdued and realxing. -The spa was in a renovation area, and was absolutely disappointing. However, the massage therapist was competent, and after the renovation, things may be quite a bit nicer. -The renovated rooms were nice. The rooms in Tower I (that we saw) were a little run-down, but not bad. Be aware, if you get a room without a view, it is really a bad view, like a concrete wall or other rooms. Conversely, some of the views (like ours of New York-New York, the strip and Red Rock Canyon off in the distance, compare favorably to some of the better views anywhere (we've seen) on the strip. -The casino is not the confusing mess that some of them are. The dealers at most tables were more friendly than many, particularly after we stayed at the tables for quite a while. Some even greeted us when we passed them the next day(s), which is nice. Of course, some of our group played all through the night, which probably helped. I personally like playing multi-hand video poker, and the Excalibur had the worst selection of these games of any casino have ever been in, I had to walk over to the Luxor to find a better selection. -Following up the last point, Excalibur is very convenient to Luxor (indoor walkways) and NY-NY (outdoor walkway over the street), plus MGM and Tropicana across the street. Therer is a shuttle (somewhere) to Mandalay Bay as well, although we never used it. we were pleased with the overall location of the hotel on the strip. -We had a room safe, our companions didn't, so check with the hotel if that is important to you. -Although we did not see the \"Tournament of Kings\" show this time, we have seen it on two previous trips. If you have seen \"Cable Guy\", then you know what to expect. We enjoyed ourselves both times (once with kids, once with another 2 couples), but the food is not really that good, and don't go thirsty because both times the server was gone for long periods of time, and they have a schedule to move you on out (I wanted another beer!). There are better shows, but this one is certainly different than the others. Overall, for the price we paid, Exclaibur was an excellent value. If their people were better at customer service, we would have rated it higher. I am in the customer service business, which means I not only know how customers should be treated, I also know how much I hate the \"whiners\" and people out to score \"freebies\" for every little problem. So we try extremely hard not to whine, and to treat everyone like friends. However, the Excalibur staff, for the most part, made us feel bad for bringing up our problems, and did almost nothing to make us feel better during the process. We were given the classic \"run around\", and they did everything they could to make us lose our cool (which we didn't). The cost to them is a dissatisfied guest who is not afraid to let others know how we feel. Final recommendation, there are better casinos and better hotels. After the way we were treated, I cannot recommend Excalibur, unless you are getting a great deal, or are being comped. I can't imagine taking my group back here with all of the other choices available.", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cRight on the strip, but don't expect the Ritz\u201d", "Author": "Carline", "ReviewID": "UR7161837", "Content": "The adage 'you get what you pay for here' applies here.

And smoke filled casinos is everywhere in Vegas even in Bellagio. So if you don't smoke get ready to be a little smoked out!! Overall it was a fun trip and the Excalibur did not disappoint.

The photos I had seen prior to the trip looked exciting and promising. When I enter hotel rooms for the first time I am either excited or disappointed - unfortunately the second was to be the case. Although the room (and bathroom) were large the decor in the bedroom was dark and dated and colourless (colorless for American readers). My first thought was - oh the maid hasn't finished making the beds as there was no cover on them and the white sheets weren't exactly flat (they looked like they havent been ironed), I then found out that this was the case, there are NO covers for the beds which to me made the room look unfinished! Another thing I wasn't happy about was the fact that there was no room safe!! - surely nowadays this should be as standard, especially in a location where people probably take more money (and valuables) than anywhere else, or is this a ploy to make you spend it all a lot faster in the hotel casino! The bathroom also looked a little dated and (excuse the pun - British people will understand this bit) Bog standard! The funniest thing I found was when one of the security guards who sits near the lifts for the towers was fast asleep!!! not very good for security there! I didnt know whether to wake him to show my card or just go, so I just went! The casino area itself was nice, the eateries there were expensive (I guess that would be the case anyway).

The Excalibur is located towards the end of the newer and nicer part of Las Vegas, which I liked because the opposite end or older part of Vegas looks seedy and shady. Considering its location, the Excalibur\u2019s price was pretty good compared to other hotels on the strip. Our room was quiet (besides the sirens coming from the strip at night), it was clean, and both the room and bathroom were spacious. We didn\u2019t have any problems with the timeshare people because we said not interested and kept walking. I liked the security at the elevators and the wide variety of restaurants. The pool looked nice but during the two days we were in Vegas it was too cold to go in (even with it being the end of May). I had never been to Las Vegas before but I think it is absolutely not a family place. If you like partying, gambling, drinking, and smoking then it\u2019s the perfect place for you. If you don\u2019t like those things, because I don\u2019t, then expect not to have the greatest time. Traffic going up and down the strip is terrible no matter what time it is, so I recommend taking some form of public transportation. The shows in Vegas were pretty cool and every restaurant I ate at was great. If you are going to go anywhere (show or restaurant) I would suggest you call first, you evidently need a reservation everywhere. We made the mistake of going all the way down to the Stratosphere to have a late lunch/early dinner just to be told that we needed a reservation to eat there.

We checked in at about midday on a Wednesday; there was no queue and we were up in our room within about ten minutes. The woman who checked us in was absolutely lovely-I imagined that with it being such a large hotel, the staff wouldn't be too interested in all of their guests, but it really did seem like they were making an effort to be friendly whenever we went to the front desk or safety deposit office. As for the room-we were on the 16th floor of Tower One, and were really pleased with it. True, it wasn't the most modern of rooms, but we found absolutely nothing to complain about. Both the main room and bathroom were a good size, it was very clean (with very prompt maid service every day), and very comfortable. We stayed in six hotels throughout our holiday, and this was definately our favourite room. We also had a fantastic view of the Tropicana and MGM Grand, which we were very happy with. We did have the occasional problem with noise: one night we were woken up by a couple arguing outside our door, which was a little annoying, but I don't really expect such a large hotel to stay serenely quiet all the time, so wasn't hugely bothered by it. The hotel/casino is in a good location on the Strip, with Mandalay Bay and Luxor linked by a Monorail and moving walkways, and casinos like NY-NY and MGM Grand just a two minute walk away. The casino itself is not one of the most modern or nicest on the Strip but this doesn't really matter, because there are so many other options around to spend your time. We ate at the Roundtable Buffet once; we knew it wasn't supposed to be brilliant, but we were rather tired on our first day and it was more out of convenience than anything else. We actually didn't find it to be too bad-it had enough to fill us up and wasn't too expensive. We also ate at the Sherwood Forest Cafe for breakfast, and thought it was fine-good service, and decent food. The food court was also really handy. Excalibur may not have the fanciest restaurants on the Strip, but it certainly has enough decent places to stop you from going hungry. We booked a helicoper flight to the Grand Canyon with the tour desk, and everything was handled quickly and easily, with really friendly service-again, no complaints at all. On first arriving, we were immediately hunted down by the timeshare people, who proceeded to take up about fifteen minutes talking to us; our immediate thoughts was that they would drive us crazy during our stay! However, we escaped that time, and were never caught out again. From then on, we either walked quickly past with a 'sorry', or simply told them it was our last day in Vegas. They are a bit of a pain, and we did find ourselves bothered by them more in this hotel than when visiting others, but as long as you don't let yourself be caught out, they aren't a major problem. Considering the price we paid was so much cheaper than the majority of other Strip hotels, we were over the moon with our experience at the Excalibur. If we were to return to Vegas on a bigger budget, we would most likely choose a different hotel simply to widen our experience a bit. However, we would have no problems with returning to the Excalibur, and absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a friendly, cheap, comfortable and clean Strip hotel.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cVery realistic: Smelly and grotty like the Medieval times\u201d", "Author": "pungpui", "ReviewID": "UR6745756", "Content": "This 4000+ room hotel and casino was finished in 1990 and especially in comparison to the never ending development of new casino\u2019s in Vegas, it is certainly showing signs of offering less superior accommodations and facilities to its younger brothers. Part of the massive MGM Mirage group in Vegas, I believe this has to be the worst property of the lot. The pictures show a colourful castle-themed resort where I expected much more theme than actually offered. There is simply no distinction between hotel and casino in this place. All entries into the building lead straight into the casino, with the registration area on one side. To access either of the 2 towers of rooms, they are located at opposite ends of the casino, so it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see people with children walking through the casino area with heavy baggage! What on earth is that about? There is absolutely no personality with the hotel staff at all. With 4000 rooms to check in a day, check-in staff are like passport control people at the airport: looks like they permanently lost control of their face muscles and is locked in \u2018boredom\u2019 position. The only staff who actually do talk to you are those annoying show ticket salesmen who literally drag you off what your are doing and try to get you to attend a seminar. You MUST be careful in Vegas about this, especially at any MGM Mirage casino. It looks like they are offering a concierge style service, but all they want you to do is attend a seminar by offering cheap show tickets afterwards. Even on the strip, there are stalls saying \u2018Las Vegas Information\u2019, but they are really just the same time-share salesmen trying to get you to invest. Common first questions to draw you in are \u2018Where are you from?\u2019, or they try and shake your hand. Just keep walking, it\u2019s awful. Just as annoying as those people who flick hooker cards at you while walking on the strip. The entire hotel, from head to toe is done in a medieval castle-style theme, and that is the same as the rooms offered. There are 2 types of general rooms offered: normal and deluxe. The only different is deluxe has a little more floor space for a couch, but is limited to the 1st 7 floors (so any hopes of a good view of the strip are gone). We opted for the more expensive deluxe, and found it to be a little too realistically medieval! Room felt too dark, the design of the bed spreads and curtains was just yuck to a stage where you don\u2019t really want to lie on the bed, and the furniture is very minimal. The 2 chairs and table look like they are going to collapse, and there is no central air-conditioning. Each room has its own unit which is attached under the window, so if it\u2019s on, it blows the curtains upwards. It\u2019s also incredibly noisy and distracting when sleeptime. The bathroom is huge, however, but completely lacks in colour. There is only one massive shower (no tub), and there is a small fan which looks like it had cheaply been added after the room was completed \u2013 the power was too low and it was completely useless as the mirrors fogged up during showers anyway. Towels smelt old and felt thin (ie used for a long time). The hallway is similarly medieval: dark and smells damp. I did, however, like the fact that entry into the hotel tower required you to show your room card to the guard outside the lifts, so we felt a little more secure. Location is very good for south of the strip, with very frequent monorail/trams to Mandalay Bay and Luxor, and foot bridges to New York New York and Tropicana, themselves foot-bridge linked to MGM Grand. However most of the newer, more exciting casino\u2019s are emerging at the northern end of the strip such as Caesar\u2019s, Wynn, Venetian, the new Trump hotel being built, Bellagio. These are quite a walking distance away. Also note that any tours booked or airport transfers will have pick up and drop off at the back of the hotel (the Rotunda), complete opposite side to the main taxi, hotel check-in area. Why this occurs is beyond me, makes transferring hectic, especially if you\u2019ve just arrived and don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. Overall, I don\u2019t think I would recommend this casino to anyone at all. I did read in a newsletter that 1000 of the 4000 rooms are being renovated at the moment, as is the pool area, but that still wouldn\u2019t change the old feel and incredibly poor layout of the casino and registration areas downstairs.

We were slightly annoyed that once we checked in we were immediately jumped on by the timeshare people, trying to book us on a trip to view the latest wonder of the world accomodation in exchange for show tickets. We declined the offer, but this happened on a few occasions during the 3 night stay, in the end we just told them we'd already turned down the offer previously. Lifts to our block were very easy to find, unlike some other properties on the strip (hello NYNY) and after a lenghty walk down the corridor we came to our room. The room was marvellous. Very very big, much bigger than the standard rooms in both the Luxor and the NYNY and obviously with a medieval theme. Plenty of space for bags etc, a great chest of drawers/televison cabinet and table and chairs in the corner. There was also a nice relaxing soft chair in the room as well. Bathroom wasn't quite up to the standard of the rest of the room, it was still large but had been slightly neglected. It wasn't dirty by any means, but there were a few tiles cracked etc, nothing major to worry about, and exactly how long do you spend in the bathroom in Vegas?

We simply couldn't go to the buffet for three days because it was so busy and long lineups( not only there-at Rio, we had waited over an hour for a seafood buffet just to get in a line up and we gave up).

The Excalibur's self check-in machine is a little slow and confusing but it did give me my keycard eventually (and it was still faster than waiting in line for a live person). One thing I really liked is that the Excalibur has a tiny convenience store by the elevator lobby for each tower, as well as a larger convenience store in the second floor mall.

Our experience started off with walking into our room and finding that our toilet had been used and not flushed, either from the previous guest or the housekeeping staff, we didn't really care which. This of course brings up the question of the room being cleaned as a check out room or as a stay over room. Finding a dirty toilet questions the cleanliness of the entire room. We called down immediately and after having to explain that 'no it is not ok to just flush it and use it' we were moved to another room. The room we were moved into was the same size etc and though the furniture was pretty beaten up (and this was an upgraded room that I paid extra for) we were ok. Then one evening the bathroom light went out. We called to housekeeping who contacted engineering who sent someone up. He started to tear everything apart saying that it wasn't just the bulb but that the whole thing needed replacing and he would need parts. We said that was fine as we were going out and that we needed to use the bath room to freshen up before we went. The maintenance man said he would go and get the parts and come back and fix it. When we arrived back in our hotel room at 1 AM we walked in to find that nothing had been touched and pieces of the light fixture was all over the counter and floor, just as he left it. We called down to find out what had happened and why our light was still not working. They once again sent up a maintenance man, a different one of course because the other was now off shift. He walked into the room and started out by asking 'who took the light apart?', I am guessing he assumed we knew who they have on staff since he didn't. After telling him that we hadn't done it he then said \"well the Front Desk shouldn't have checked you into this room'. After telling him that we had already been in the room for 4 days by this point, the game of 20 questions finally ended. He went down to the maintenance area to get parts and when he came back explained that on the work order it stated that we 'threw' the other guy out and that is why he never came back. Saying that we needed to use the washroom while he was getting parts to fix it is apparently 'throwing' him out of the room. Finally after maintenance man number 2 going downstairs two more times to get the correct parts our light was finally fixed at roughly 2:45AM. During this time I went to the Front Desk to complain and the front desk supervisor said that she wouldn't charge us for the upgrade, a whole $10.00 a night. I am in the hotel industry and I tend to be more understanding because I know that sometimes things happen, this however went beyond just bad service. So between our room adventures, the restaurant being highly over priced for the quality you get, watching people sitting at slot machines with their children sitting beside them (in strollers as well) which is against the law in Nevada, and people taking photographs in the gaming area (which is also against the law apparently) we will never recommend this hotel to anyone.

I was wrong. Upon arrival around 6:30 pm, we were told that there were no non-smoking rooms available, only smoking rooms with king beds. Even if we had gone ahead and took a smoking room (which I had no interest in doing), we still needed 2 beds, because our 2 children were with us. The staff made no attempt to accommodate us. I guess she thought we could all squeeze into one bed. She only repeated that there was nothing available. Finally, after about 20 minutes of us just standing there, she finally decided to talk to a manager. After 5 minutes, she came back and said that she and the manager had \"found\" a nonsmoking room with double beds. I had paid extra for a strip view, but my view was of the Tropicana hotel, entirely, nothing else. The beds were pretty uncomfortable and the shower had quite a bit of mildew. The temperature dipped into the 30s at night, and the first night we discovered the heating unit was not working, so they ended up replacing the entire unit. I also didn't care for the buffet setup, having to fix your plate before you find a seat. We stayed at the Excalibur with our children about 3 years ago. We didn't complain then because we paid a very cheap price and for the money, we could live with it. However, this time, the price was not much lower than some of the other hotels on the strip, so I expected better.

I would Never have gotten into that jacuzzi it was so yucky....the jacuzzi had this rug cover and it was all fraying ...it was so scary...

We discovered a fantastic room rate online for Excalibur and decided to spend Thanksgiving week there. Previously I stayed at the Flamingo, but I was not yet 21 so my experience is limited. However, I don't remember the Flamingo being quite as bad as the Excalibur. For starters, as you walk through the doors you are instantly knocked back with a backdraft of old carpet and cigarette smoke. The tar and smokey haze literally permeated the entire complex. I realize that there are a lot of smokers in Vegas, but it seems like the Excalibur has never even installed a proper ventilation system, let alone maintained one. We confirmed this by walking through most of the other casinos -- we didn't have a single problem with cigarettes elsewhere. As for the hotel itself, it reminded me of any Best Western in the middle of nowhere: nothing to write home about. The lighting was poor, the carpets looked 16 years old, the bathroom fixtures were dated and leaky, and the bed was stiff. The air conditioning unit was so loud that we just turned it off and opened the window; too bad they only let you open the window about 2 inches. We reserved a king bed 2 months in advance, but when we arrived they told us all they had were two queens. Luckily we were able to trade to a king room the next night.

The restaurants feel straight out of a suburban strip mall: uninspired and overpriced. The buffet felt like a cow stable and the food was awful. The 24-hour cafe, Sherwood Cafe, wasn't bad but $10 for a croissant and fruit? Are you joking? As for the casino, the aformentioned cigarette smoke was too much to bear. Also, the Excalibur staff were quite aggressive in pushing their timesharing scams and pounced on us nearly every time we walked from our room to the casino floor. One plus was that the cocktail waitresses were very attentive and friendly. The shows? Unless you like watching a Medieval Times ripoff or a male stripper show, you won't like the Excalibur. They apparently booked the washed up Louie Anderson but he was gone when we arrived; there are much better comedians in Vegas anyway. All in all, I felt bad for my wife. I'd built up Vegas to be a wonderful place, which it still is, but the Excalibur was a let down.

Although a number of people have complained about children I didn\u2019t find them too much of a problem.

The second floor of the hotel has a variety of quick and easy dining options, including a Quizno's sub shop, a fast food joint (McDonalds, I think), and Krispy Kreme donuts and Coldstone Ice Cream for treats.

We booked the first 2 days at the Excalibur through there official webpage due it looked like a cool place to stay. Well we landed into the airport and cabbed over which wasn't far at all. We paid about $15 bucks with tip which is the same as a shuttle and quicker. We made our way into the lobby after turning down a gentleman at the door offering us to take our bags to our room. We turned him down due to we have never been to Vegas and didn't want to get robbed and we didn't have a room yet. Its very true about the huge line for check in which looked like a hour long wait guranteed but we headed over to the auto check in and using the credit card that was used to book the room we pulled up our reservation and had 3 keys printed off. Took a couple of minutes and we headed to our room. The hotal has 2 towers at each end and different set of elavators to get to said rooms based on the room numbers. So be sure to read your instructions so you don't take the wrong elvator just to come back down and wait again. The hotel is so huge and the elavators were slow so being only on the thrid floor we just took the stairs to save time. Room and bathroom was pretty clean and roomy because we were 3 guys and we had an air mattress. We had 2 double beds and the air mattress I brought so we can share the beds evenly. Works out well and can save you a bundle on room rates. The view from the room sucked as we looked right at a wall due to being so low to the ground on the thrid floor. Heard alot about the timeshare reps but you learn were they set up shop and they target couples so don't hold hands or be arm and arm if you go with a boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife and just keep walking by them if you don't want to be bothered. The food was very good after eating at the Round Table buffet twice. We had breakfast and dinner in the 2 days we stayed. Prices were decent for a buffet and it did offer something for everyone. Chinese to Mexican and even quality deserts with unlimited drink such as milk, juice, soda etc. Ate once at the Sherwood cafe(24hrs) and it was tasty for about $10 bucks to eat. Food court is nice with Mcdonalds, Quiznos, Krispy Kreme(24hrs) etc which is good if your looking for some fatty goodness. Luxor which is conected through the moving walkway has a food court as well for other good fast food. Overall a good hotal with plenty to see and do. I would have given this place a 5 but they did have some problems. Arcade in the basement is big and nice but most of the games are broken. Head to the Luxor for better arcade which can be accessed through a moving walkway near the food court area. All of the hotel smelled of cigarette smoke but thats Vegas for you. The guy who took my bag to load the cab after we were leaving damaged it jamming it into the car and I didn't notice till after we left and to late to process a complaint. I would stay again if I was in Vegas again.

Before you go to all the fancy hotels like the Bellagio, Luxor, etc., go to the Excalibur first and check-in. This hotel does not have the super fancy \"blinged\" out lobby like all the others do, so don't be disappointed, but it has no bearing on the hotel itself. There are self-serve check-in computers that work great, takes no time at all and avoids you having to wait in line. I booked online at the hotel website and got a decent deal. It was over Columbus Day long weekend (Thanksgiving here in Canada), so Sunday was a bit more expensive (120 USD) and the two other days were 81 USD, so not bad overall. In addition, there was a promotion that gave us $10 off the buffet, 2 match plays, and an entry to the spa (we didn't use it). The hotel is older than the surrounding ones so it shows a bit of wear, but not really too bad. It's also medieval themed, so if you wonder why the hotel is darker and why the rooms are darker, that's why. It seems a bit smokier smelling than the other hotels, again, it's older and likely has set in over the years. The room we had was non-smoking and had two queen beds. Large room, clean, smelled smoke-free, bathroom very clean with shower only (who bathes in hotels anyways? Yuck.) Beds could be a bit more desired though. GREAT location for the price. Tram connects to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. You can take the trolley to the Las Vegas Outlet Mall for $2 a person. The buffet is one of the better ones around and not that expensive ($14.50 for dinner). The Luxor's buffet is $20 and has nicer ambience, a little bit better food, but each has its plus and minuses. Regardless, food was very good. There's security at each tower entrance and you have to show your room key (nice bonus), and there's also time-share people coming right at you all the time. No different than a lot of other hotels and along the strip. Just ignore them and you'll be fine. Overall I would stay here again. Previous reviews have metnioned poor service and unfriendly staff. Never ran into any of that, most were more than willing to help. To get to the hotel you can take a shuttle from the airport that'll cost you about $10 return.

So anyway, here is review from a \u201cnormal\u201d person, which should help other \u201cnormal\u201d people when deciding whether or not to make this a location to stay in. The Excalibur is a very large hotel/casino. It is quite clean, has been kept up well over the years. Check in and out was quick, with no issues. There are two nice pools (One was closed during our stay) with an outside food and beverage area (The food was below standard, but the drinks were very good). The d\u00e9cor of the Excalibur could definitely use some help, but as I said, it was kept up well. On the second floor there is a food court area with a McDonalds, sandwich/pizza shop, etc. (The line is very long in the am at Mc\u2019ds). Security is posted at all entrances to the hotel tower elevators, and your room key must be shown to the guard to proceed. The Spa area seemed very nice and professional (We did not use the spa, but did wander through), and the gym/workout area was actually large and well equipped. The hallways to the rooms were dimly lit, and the d\u00e9cor was dated. The rooms were of a good size, very clean, and fine for staying in if your not going to be in them for anything but sleeping (This was all we needed it for, so it was ok), but had to be the oldest looking hotel room I have ever stayed in. The room looked like we had just stepped back in time to 1982 (I was surprised there was no shag carpet). The bed was not the best, but not the worst. We actually walked into the room and noticed no comforter on the bed. I made a call, and was informed that they were \u201cgoing through a remodel\u201d and the new comforters were not in yet, but \u201cwe triple sheeted the bed for you\u201d, ok, that was a first. We did not eat at the restaurants or buffet because of the other reviews (The buffets at MGM, Rio, and the Luxor were very good). Here is one piece of advice for anyone who does not want to fall into the time-share scams: AVOID THE PAIN IN THE BUTT PEOPLE IN THE BLUE SUITS AT VARIOUS BOOTHS THROUGHOUT THE EXCALIBUR!!!!! These people are hardcore pains, they bother you every time you walk by them; \u201cNewlyweds?, Where are you from?, Want free show tickets?, etc., etc\u2026. We were ready to kill them by the last day.. So, all in all, if you\u2019re looking for a clean, decent place to stay, with a good location on the strip I recommend Excalibur. We stayed here because it was reviewed ok, and it was one of the cheaper choices in the package we purchased (It was the best choice of the locations offered in the package, at a value price). I have stayed at Ballys, Paris, and TI in LV before, and would definitely stay at all of them again, but would not return to the Excalibur unless there was a really good deal.

Odd that the next day we saw them delivering comforters to the room next door. The rooms were ugly as heck and did not have a tub only a large shower. I was fighting a cold and could have used a nice hot bath. They were fairly clean, but VERY unimpressive considering the locale and price of this hotel. They did not offer the opportunity to upgrade although I'd heard they had plenty of rooms available. At the Luxor they upgraded us to a Suite for free w/out even asking. Here I asked and they said NO. Oddly the tables in the casino were beat up and old. It may be an odd thing to complain about, but it was junky. The people were friendly and I highly recommend the Champagne Brunch Buffett. It was excellent. Overall it wasn't bad, but I just expected a little more glitz for the being on the Strip.

Don't expect special treatment. I've stayed in cheaper that were better. Try the Las Vegas Hilton. It was much better. I went in summer and there were kids everywhere. So if you have kids, it's probably a good value for you. But singles and couples w/o kids will not have a good time. No nightlife to speak of and very few bars, all open to the casino floor. No lounges to just chill out in. The buffet was the worst I've ever had in my many trips to Las Vegas. But it was inexpensive compared to most. I stayed because I was with a friend that suggested it since she had a players club card and we did get the 1st night free due to her points. So it's hard to say no to a free night. But I won't stay there again. The pool was sub par. No umbrellas or shade if you wanted it. And it was teeming with kids. Drinks at the pool were expensive except for the bucket of beer. If you don't drink beer, watch your wallet! Staff was generally friendly. We did have some problems with check in. They didn't want to give us the free night. And then they called the next day and said my friend's credit card was declined and we needed to make other arrangements to pay for the second night. My friend called her credit card company and they said there was no problem with the card. She tried to pay again and yet again the card was declined. We went to the ATM and pulled out cash off the credit card. There didn't seem to be a problem at all. And I have to say the staff member helping us was not nice and seemed to think we were deadbeats, and treated us as such. The 24 hr coffee shop restaurant was great. The wait staff was wonderful, especially the late shift. We had one waiter in particular we loved. He treated us great! Food was pretty good for the value. I prefer coffee shop restaurants to the buffets because the food is usually better and I can't eat my money's worth at the all you can eat places. The room was so so. The whole place needs some updating. And the non smoking floor stunk of smoke, including our room. Maids were friendly and room was clean except for the shower/tub. I found a hair. And you know what kind I'm talking about! It was on the wall of the shower. YUCK!!!!!!! One other small thing, the elevators were sweltering. Everyone complained about them. A suggestion would be to add some a/c. Didn't try the more expensive restaurants, so can't give an opinion. The hotel/casino layout was bizarre. Check in is miles away from the two hotel towers and you can easily get lost. All in all just a slightly below average place. Try it if you're on a budget with kids.

You smelled the cigarette smoke from the minute you walk in the door until you get onto the elevator. We found that some of the other casino's were not as bad. I would not recommend the casino if you are very sensitive to cigarette smoke. We were very frustrated by the timeshare people as well. They would attack you no matter what hotel/casino you were in, not just the Excalibur. They are even out on the street. They would not only ask you how long you were staying, but some would ask if you wanted free tickets. They are dressed in suits and look like the hotel staff. Some are very aggressive and will get in your face. You almost have to get rude to them. The Sherwood Forest Cafe was very good. The Roundtable Buffet was great for breakfast. There are lots of choices! There are many buffets that are approx. 50-75 feet long. Plus there are different buffets for Chinese, Mexican, and desserts. The breakfast buffet during the week is only $10.99 and if you leave hungry, if is your own fault. There are plenty of taxi's available from the Excalibur. The taxi from the airport to the Excalibur was around $16.00 not including tip. The taxi' drivers were very nice and helpful even though there may have been a slight language barrier. We were able to catch the shuttle to the airport after our stay was over. The shuttle was $5.50 per person. You may store your luggage at the bell hop area if you have arrived before check in or need to check out long before your flight out. This was free. I would suggest tipping though.

The room was great, nice bathroom with marble and a steamer in the shower and plenty of room. The beds were super comfortable. The room felt clean and smelled good. I agree with what other reviewers have said about the timeshare hawks. It is really inappropriate and uncomfortable. Although I was not approached because I was with my friends and not my wife, I did see them confronting most of the couples and baby boomer generation folks that walked by them. Your best bet is to put a mean look on your face like you just lost a bunch of money and look straight ahead as you walk past them. You will know it's them because they all say the same thing \"how long are you staying here?\" I think it is too bad that Excalibur allows this garbage, they must think their guests are primarily idiots who will actually buy timeshares (as that is a qualifier for purchasing).

No longer are the days of $5.00 buffets or a buck a beer (or free beer for that matter). I wasn't impressed with any of the sights there, it's over extravegant, and excessive to the extreme. As for the hotel, I stayed there in 1996 and it was okay then, now it's run down and in dire need of a reno. Our room was clean and quiet, but the pool area was dirty as well as the casino and restaurants. I actually saw a cockroach at the McDonald's (2nd floor) on the wall....Yikes! Another reason the stay wasn't all that pleasant was the constant bombardment by salesman for some stupid timeshare / casino deal. Everytime you came in or out of the casino, they jumped all over you. We found out that every hotel on the strip has this new deal now. It's a real pain. Another thing about the Excalibur is the constant humming of helicopters that fly between New York New York and Excalibur. It starts at 8:30 am sharp to 2:00 am. If you're outside, it's horrible.

Our mid-afternoon check-in was a breeze - there was no line at the desk. While not the most luxurious accomodations we have had, the room was adequate and comfortable. We were on the 19th floor and had a view of the airport, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. While it had no tub, the bathroom was large as was the shower. The beds were comfortable -- the only issue we had with the room was that there was no truly \"comfortable\" chair to sit in. We liked the fact that we had to show our room key every time we approached the elevators - great security. Regarding the elevators, the middle elevator (upper floors) in Tower 1 performed inconsistently. Several times it would not leave the main level, and the doors would open, close, open, etc. We patronlzed the food court a few times, as well as the Regale Italian restaurant (excellent) and the buffet and Sherwood Forest(good). Other dining options were conveniently located at New York New York and MGM Grand. The Timeshare Hawks were always lurking when we entered the hotel. A good strategy for avoiding them is to give the appearance of not being a family or couple, whom they seem to only approach. However a \"no thanks\" and wave of the hand works equally well. Our son liked the Midway Arcade - it was the best one of all of the hotels we visited. The casino was large, but not overwhelmingly so. Although immense in size, it is relatively easy to find your way around the property. This is evidenced by the fact that my directionally-challenged wife quickly learned how to get around in the hotel. The pool area was fine - we only visited it once, on a Friday afternoon, and had no problem finding a group of 3 empty chairs. We used the valet parking service almost every time. Once we returned to the hotel in the evening and were greeted with a \"valet full\" sign. It took us a while to find a parking place, and then it was somewhat of a walk to the building. The next night we were greeted with the same sign, but we were accomodated anyway. In all, the valet service was efficient and the attendants were courteous. Our reservations were made initially through the hotel's website. However I received a promotional email from the property a week before our arrival which quoted lower rates. I phoned the reservation desk and was quickly accomodated with the lower rates. Are there more economical properties in Las Vegas? Probably. Are there more luxiourious ones? Definitely.

The reviews on this site lead you to believe you will find a run down hotel. I did not feel this was the case at all. It is themed like a castle and that is exactly what it looks like. I spent time gambling in the casino and did find it to be smoky in places, but no more than any other hotel we walked through. I wish something would be done about this issue overall. I don't feel I should have to breathe second hand smoke and it should be banned in all public places including casinos. We enjoyed the fast food restaurant choices on the second level of the hotel (especially Krispy Kremes). The prices in Las Vegas are high and so it was a nice change to be able to find a cheap meal. We also spent a great deal of time in the arcade/carnival portion of the hotel for children. We had three children with us and they enjoyed the time spent. My only complaint of this hotel is here. Many of the machines were either broken down or ate our money. The children still had fun here. Once again smoking was allowed even on this level and they even provided ashtrays on this level, yuck! The early registration was great and the walkways to Luxor and Mandalay Bay were great. We were able to cross the street to get onto the Deuce Bus and used that the entire time we were there to travel up and down the strip. It is a convient walk to the New York from the bridge at the Excalibur. If you want a great value don't hesitate to stay here.", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay At The Excalibur!!!\u201d", "Author": "NtrDm2004", "ReviewID": "UR5424256", "Content": "We stayed here in June 2006 for our honeymoon and it was absolutely awful!

The ice bucket was flimsy plastic, so the milk on put on ice to have with my cereal in the morning was sitting in a bucket of water. I did find out from a fellow student that you can rent a fridge for an additional $20 per night. As I was taking a redeye, I called the front desk on my last day and requested a late checkout. The person told me that would be fine, and it would $25. When I looked at my bill, they had charged me $40.

This is the first time I've written a review, and the reason I'm doing it is I was extremely disappointed in just about everything about this hotel.

The Hotel: There are many places to eat within the hotel, we tried the Round table buffet for breakfast which had great choice of foods and was very nice, we also tried Sherwoods cafe which again was nice to eat at, we also went to the Ragele restraunt wich was a good itialian and proved popular as it was busy every nite. Although the Hotel offers a good variety of diffrent places to eat going out of the hotel to eat was sometimes cheaper. The pool was very nice, there were 2 pools available and one had 2 slides wich was great for kids. we prefered the other pool with no slides as it was quieter and more relaxing.

Returning sometime that evening, the scent was overpowering as soon as we opened the door. We made a call to the front desk, explaining the situation. They agreed to send someone up. In about 15-20 minutes, a man came up to our room with a spray to get rid of smoke smell. As soon as he came in, he realized that this odor was simply not smoke! He left to find someone else. We got a call, and they offered to move us to another room that evening. We did and had no trouble with the new room.

I read that someone else had been stuck in one of these elevators as well. After noticing that the elevator I was stuck in was still powered off and doors propped open on the eight floor two days after the incident occurred, I really began to wonder abou the safety of the elevators in general. I also noticed that one of the lighted buttons on the \"down\" button did not light, and that in one elevator cab, the \"Door Closed\" button had been replaced with a bolt and washer... substandard maintenance? You be your own judge, but having worked in the elvator business before, I am unsure why anything but a proper repair would be made to something as critical as an elevator, and the owners of this hotel ought to check this out. Overall I would recommend the Excalibur to anyone who has kids, as the kids were plentiful at the pool, midway, etc. It is also not a bad location to stay if you intend to plat at any of the adjacent casinos (Luxor, Mandalay Bay, NY NY, MGM).

One of the best pluses was the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job during our stay, our standard double queen room was kept very clean and tidy. This hotel is on the low end when compared to the newer upscale casinos on the south Strip, but it is probably the most family-friendly affordable property in Las Vegas. The rooms are newer and much nicer than Circus Circus, you may regret falling prey to their cheap specials. There is a small midway with carnival games on the lower level of Excalibur, along with a 2-screen ridefilm theater. Bring a small electric travel cooler if staying with children, it is an additional $20 a day to rent a refrigerator for the standard and deluxe rooms. Only hotel guests have access to the pool area, which reduces the crowds that you find at some of the other casino pools on the Strip that are used as crosswalks much of the time. We were staying with our 7 month-old infant, and the pool was a good feature of the hotel, although they really need some shaded structures - there are no patio coverings or large shade trees around the pool whatsoever, only bright desert sun. There is a large 3 ft. pool area hidden behind the bar and snack stand, I would have missed it if I did not go looking for it, it has no signage to direct you, but it is a nice large area to find. The tropical slide was closed for long-term repair while we were there. Being a family friendly hotel, in addition to their usual signature upscale restaurants they offer a food court with Quiznos, Krispy Kreme, Pizza Hut Express, and of course McDonalds where a Sausage & Egg McMuffin is only $1. We chose to have our breakfasts in the Sherwood Forest Cafe restaurant, very fresh and lots of variety, breakfast was around $8-$11 a person. Skip the \"new\" Round Table Buffet - it was dried-out and generic, not fresh and over-priced poor quality despite being the cheapest on the Strip, you get what you pay for. For a few dollars more I would treat the family to the buffets at either Rio (the largest), Treasure Island or Mirage for an excelent family friendly Las Vegas buffet experience for the prices you are going to spend anyway ($20-$25 per adult is an average buffet in Las Vegas). The buffet at Rio was very family friendly and worth the wait in line. They have something for everyone and also many items you do not expect, very fresh and great variety.

Please note though if you're going to be in Vegas- only make it a 2 day or 3 day trip max. You can do everything in Vegas over a weekend and if you stay longer you'll get bored- there's only soo much you can gamble.

The receptionist commented what you don't have reservations? Even though we passed 10 signs that said, \"No Armor, No Reservations, No Problem\" that's why we decided to stay there. But I let it go because I was so excited to do the Tournament of Kings Dinner Show. When we got in line and waited our turn, the guy said, \"tonight is a black out night\". There is no show on Tuesday nights but no advertisement for that. So at this point I was truly beginning to feel we should have gone to Circus Circus.

We were on the third floor in Tower II and we had quite a lot of noise at night when people were coming back to their rooms. One morning at 4.00 a.m. we had an American girl screaming and crying on the corridor saying she was not going to University and she wanted to go home and this was certainly not the only night we had a problem with noise!!! I do not know why Americans have to be so loud and noisy when they are returning to their rooms - I think they think that if they are up in the early hours of the morning then everybody else is but when you are getting up at 5.30 a.m. to go on a trip it is certainly no joke!!!!! We were not too hassled by the timeshare people we just told them sternly, no we were not interested and they left us alone. Everybody was helpful and pleasant at the hotel and after reading other reviews was pleasantly surprised that we did not have a long wait to either book in or book out - only waited about 5 minutes both times. We never really ate at the hotel - we had breakfast at Caesars Palace at the Stage Deli, New York when we were not on trips and ate at different hotels for dinner. We went downtown on the Deuce bus which only cost $2 each way for each person but be prepared for it to take about 1 hour to get there and about 45 minutes to get back because of traffic. If you get chance go and see Mama Mia at the Mandalay Bay and Celine Dion at Caesars Palace. They are both brilliant shows and well worth the money. We also went on trips to Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, Grand Canyon West Rim and Death Valley. All very good and enjoyed each one especially the Bryce Canyon trip. There is also a trip with My Travel to Laughlin which costed $2.50 per person. You get a free buffet dinner which tasted very nice and we went up the Colorodo River on a boat trip and went to an outlet shopping centre which was quite nice. It was nice to get out of Las Vegas to a much quieter place for the day. Also would recommend the free shuttle bus to the Rio from Harrahs. The carnival floats in the Masquerade Village were very good. They come out all lit up and there is music and dancers and the floats go across the ceiling - we enjoyed our evening there. All in all we enjoyed our stay at the Excalibur.

I thought about cancelling my reservation, but instead opted for a room upgrade to a King Spa suite. A couple of days before my trip, I saw that the internet rates had dropped to lower than my reservation rate. I called and asked if I could get the lower rate for the night that had not sold out yet. The serviceperson said yes on that, but turned down my request for lowering the other nights, because they were sold out and \"out of the system\" I was fine with that. She then put me on hold and came back and said her supervisor agreed to lower the rate on my entire stay. How's that for service??? Express check in was easy at the kiosk. The room was as pleasantly clean and the bedspread an linens seemed clean and fresh. The towels were not real thick, though. My hamburger and fries and my wife's meatball sub at the Sherwood Forest cafe was tasty and served fast and friendly. Our one dinner at the Roundtable Buffet was OK for a buffet. Try the prime rib if you go. In the food court, Quizno's, Manchu Wok, Krispy Kreme and McDonald's all offered good food for a nice price. We spent alot of time at the casino...the dealers were nice and the atmosphere was fun. I compared it to alot of other casinos on the strip it was quite adequate and a nice atmosphere in comparison. Get the \"one club\" card and show it so you can get comps. We are not high rollers and just a few hours a day on the tables earned us a $100 comp. A lot of big spenders never bothered to use a card. Yes, the casino was smoky, but we loved the non-smoking table areas. Many of you may like that as well. The pool area was fun (HOT) and packed each day by 10:30 am, so get there earlier for a chair. Overall, the experience I had was enjoyable. The staff were mostly helpful and friendly and seemed happy we were there.

This hotel is a nice place to stay in Las Vegas if you are looking for a clean room at a great location. We were on the 18th floor in tower one and it was great because there is an express elevator that goes straight to the 18th floor and above. If you want a non-smoking room, request the 18th floor. The room was clean, although the sheets had a small tear on one bed, and I found a hair or two on the floor in the bathroom when we arrived. The shower was fine, although one of the mornings, the water was warm at best even though I had it turned to the hottest setting possible. The other three mornings, we had plenty of hot water. The room was surprisingly quiet. We left the fan on high while we slept and heard very little hall noise. The pool area was fairly crowded, but our daughter really enjoyed the shallow pool and rafts you can rent. She also enjoyed playing the midway games downstairs. I agree with many other reviews that the timeshare people are very annoying. They hang out by the entrance and both towers and are quite aggressive. Unfortunately, many other hotels have the same problems. They were even worse when we stayed at the Flamingo, and on this trip, we were also bothered a few times at the Forum Shops at Caesar's. We tried the express check-in and the machine worked, but the key cards it gave us did not work very well. The next day we had to go to the front desk and get new keys, but they were very friendly and gave us some discount coupons for the midway downstairs. We ate two meals in the hotel. The buffet was nothing special and fairly expensive. On the other hand, we had dinner at the Camelot Room Steak House. While it was expensive (dinners $25.00-$40.00), both the food and the service were exceptional. I recommend the Excalibur for families and budget travelers.

I can't say it would be that quick the closer it got to the weekend. Come earlier in the week if you are going to visit. The room was your typical hotel room...nothing special but hey you are not going to Vegas to stay inside your room all day. We had the \"Deluxe\" room with a King size bed. There is plenty of room in this size, don't know about the other sizes. This hotel is one of the older \"mega\" hotels on the strip and the amenities show it. I personally did not like the casino. It was very smoky and the service to get a drink while gambling is nearly impossible to get. We ate at the Sherwood cafe the first night and the food was pretty good and did have reasonably priced food. The slot machines at this casino are not the best for paying out either. Compared to the pricing (room/food/drinks) of the rest of the mega hotels this doesn't rate too badly. As for the air quality and amenities, this hotel ranks on the bottom for me. Other Hotels / The Strip The casino's that I liked the best were Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay and New York New York. They are much newer, their drink service while gambling is very good and you can actually breathe inside the casinos! One thing I noticed about Vegas and the Strip is that all hotels are geared to keep the guests in the casino and not in the restaurants or rooms. We tried many restaurants at many hotels and none of them place a bathroom inside the restaurant. They force you to go out into the casino to use one....convinently located next to slot machines. I can say that pretty much every bathroom I entered was clean....a surprise with the amount of people going through them. Bring your pocket book if you are going to eat / drink / sleep on the strip. Nothing on the Strip is cheap! Old Vegas The last night (saturday) we went to the old Vegas (Freemont St). Now this is what Las Vegas is supposed to be like! Eat / drink / and gamble like they want you there. Drinks were very cheap, the service was right there when you needed something and the casinos seem to pay out more often than the Strip. The covered street is also cool to see. Shows start at 8PM and run until 11PM on the hour....and are free. Everyone we were with had a blast that night.....can't say that about other nights on The Strip. Overall I would leave it. I wanted to see Vegas and the mega hotels and now that is a place a can check off the list. Seeing the mega hotels is worth it and there are plenty of things to see that cost next to nothing and/or are free. I am not one that likes to be in smoky areas and a majority of the places on The Strip are very smoky. As a non-smoker, I feel like I am going through nicotine withdrawals today. If you are going to see a show, eat or go out to the clubs.....bring a lot of money, it is not cheap on The Strip! I've spent a lot less money on vacations elsewhere in the states and outside of the states and had a lot more fun. Oh yeah, one last thing....as you are on vacation spend the money like you are on vacation. We rented a Porsche from Dream Car Rentals and drove out to the Hoover Dam on the back roads.

For anyone on a budget, look no further than this Hotel. Everything about it is cheap, cheerful and great value for money. The rooms are enourmous (especially with just a King bed in) and everything you want is there. The room was meticulously cleaned everyday and the toiletries restocked when needed. The bathroom was bigger than the \"double\" room, we stayed in, in New York the previous week, which shows the size of this place. Access to the two towers is from the casino, so you are not having to walk huge distances to your accomodation. If you are lucky enough to get into Tower 2, there is even an all night coffee bar right next to it (gets a bit busy in the morning). The food is also great. We usually plumped for the Buffet breakfast for 11 dollars each. After \"pigging\" out, we didnt need anything else until evening, really great value for money. The other buffets (lunch and dinner) are just as good with a fantastic selection. We had dinner in \"The Steakhouse at Camelot\" for our Wedding Anniversary. Whilst a lot more expensive, the food was cooked perfectly and again excellent value for money. Excaliburs location is superb, being central to 7 other casinos (dont bother with Hooters, a big disappointment). The new Duece bus, literally stops outside, so is great to getting to any part of the strip or downtown and for $5 for 24 hours, hop on/off is excellent value for money. Unfortunately, the Vegas curse has struck the Excalibur. Whilst it is the the busiest, livelest and most fun place to be of the three group hotels in that area (Luxor and Mandalay Bay been the others, which quite frankly were dead most nights), the money men have decided, that \"cheap, cheerful and fun\" is not for them and are closing it at the end of the year and tearing it down. The downside (as mentioned in another review) is that Vegas has become the Timeshare capital of the world. EVERY Hotel/Casino is offering lucrative goodies of free shows, holidays etc to get you to go to the timeshare presentations. What they dont tell you when you get snarred, is that it is Timeshare. You only find this out when you get the free, complimentry bus. BE WARNED, the 2 to 3 hour, no obligation, presentation, turns into a 4 to 5 hour interegation and extreme pressure to sign. Although at the end of it all, we did get the promised goodies, even though we didnt sign. If you have to go to one show in Vegas, go to Mama Mia, its brilliant.

I arranged the trip thru Southwest Airlines Vacations, so the room was basically free. Even so, we were pleased with our stay. Our room was a basic hotel room with a good king-size bed, and a nice sized bathroom. No frills, but no complaints. The service from the hotel staff was very good, especially the baggage handlers. They were cheerful, and efficient. Tipping before they move the bags may have something to do with that. We checked in at noon, but we only had a few rooms to choose from. If a view from your room is important, don't bother trying to check in early. We ate at 4 different buffets. I'm known for eating anything and usually don't complain. My impressions are as follows: Roundtable Buffet for dinner (Excalibur) - terrible; you pile food on a plate before you're seated. How stupid is that? Limited choices and very mediocre food. Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - great; get a Total Rewards card first and get 2 $5 off coupons. We got there at 10:30, paid the breakfast rate and ate brunch. That way you can have bacon, sausage AND prime rib! We ate here twice for breakfast. Village Seafood Buffet (Rio) - hated it; it's like calling the hogs to eat. If you don't eat 25 little crawfish-sized lobster tails, it's a waste of money. To eat the lobster, you've got to stand in lines waiting for a fresh pan full. If there's more than 5 people ahead of you, you get the dregs, and it ain't pretty. Other than the lobster, this buffet is mediocre. In my opinion, it's the biggest tourist trap in Vegas. That's saying something. The Buffet (Bellagio) - Great: again, got there at 10:30 and chose from breakfast and lunch buffets. The food and ambience doesn't match the rest of this resort/casino. The only reason I rated it great is because I had 3 Filet Mignon and Havarti on crusty sourdough sandwiches. My favorite meat, favorite cheese and favorite bread in one place.

This was my second stay there in the last year. Our first trip out we asked for any available upgrades (of course hoping for a freebie). They said they could upgrade us from a standard to a deluxe for an additional $10/night. We agreed, thinking that we were really going to be getting a better room. We were disappointed. We had a room on the 3rd floor, tower 2. Our view out the window was of a BIG TREE. And there was a sign hanging on the window, \"please do not open the windows, due to moths flying in\". But, we weren't staying at Ex. for the view or any \"luxurious\" features of the hotel. The deluxe room is slightly larger, with a small sofa in it. Our second trip out there we decided to save our extra $10/night and get the standard (and the standard room was comped for all 3 nights of this trip!!). The room is exactly like the deluxe, just a few feet shorter without a sofa. On this trip we had tower 1, 12th floor, room 34 (pretty close to elevator - Less walking! Yay!) Both trips we were very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel rooms. There is no bath tub at this hotel, but the shower water pressure is WONDERFUL. And we really appreciated the big vanity in the bathroom this last trip (2 women with lots of makeup/hair stuff). If you want something beyond \"basic\" this may not be your place to stay. We never spend much time in the room besides sleeping and getting ready to leave, so it was perfect for us. I have a pillow-top mattress at home, so I was concerned about how I'd sleep there. But I've always slept hard here. And we've played at the casino and are usually very generously comped (and we're by no means high or even medium rollers). And we've received plenty of free room offers in the mail. I would recommend this hotel to people who want to save some money on accomodations on the strip, however shop around first and if a better deal comes up on a better hotel - take it. We're returning in February, we have 2 nights comped at Ex and the other nights were supposed to be casino rate.

The manager informed me that they run into these issues - ants, water bugs and roaches during the winter b/c it's cold outside and warm inside. It was the most pathetic answer I could have ever heard. I told him how appalled I was and asked what he was going to do... all he offered me was another room and either a free breakfast or a late check out. The next day (it was already 4 am on day 2 so I was stuck), I immediately checked out and moved over to MGM's West Wing - which was sooo much better. All I ask for in a hotel is cleanliness and good customer service. Neither were provided. *hint - if you do stay and want to contact the front desk or anything, dial the operator to connect you. If you call the front desk (for example) \"directly\", you will have to listen to 3 minutes of pre-recording before you are actually connected.

My boyfriend and I went there for our 3 year anniversary. It was his first time there and I have been there many of times and have stayed in hotels like Treasure Island and The Hard Rock. Both are awesome hotels but can be a little pricy. Knowing that it was his first time I knew that we were NOT going to be in our room for more then just a quick sleep and a shower. So we did not want to spend a lot of money on the hotel room. We wanted to spend more time on things like a spa day (Spa Mandalay, at Mandalay bay AMAZING!) and a show (Rita Rudner, HILARIOUS!). So back to the review of the room. The hotel has had a recent \"make over\" and still has a mideval theme and is not anywhere close to luxurious!! Our room was on the 18 floor with a strip view, and the bathroom was clean and recently remodeled, the beds are rock hard so unless you pass out drunk from the yard long margaritas :) you will NOT have the best night sleep. That is the only real thing I had a problem with the hotel, was the beds. Check in was fast and friendly, The pool is HUGE with a water slide. OH, do not, REPEAT DO NOT eat at the buffet at the excalibur, NASTY...NASTY!! If you have seen Vegas Vacation... You will have an mental idea what it is like.

After checking in at 2am, we were too exhausted to argue and slept in a cramped, past it's prime full sized bed.

After seeing so many different rooms, I can tell you that the regular rooms at Excalibur are dreary, out dated, and not the cleanest I have seen. The amenities such as soap and shampoo are cheap in the regular rooms (not so in the suite). Rooms of this calibar can be had for much less at different hotels on and off the strip. I have seen deals on Hotwire and Expedia for the newer hotels (Venetian, Bellagio, MGM, etc.) for just a little more per nite than we paid. The buffet was HORRIBLE; overpriced, dried out, bland and cheap food. The cafe was decent, reasonably (not great) priced. Room service was AWFUL; cold, expensive, incomplete, and served by a rude waiter. Order a pizza instead. The food court was ok, I especially enjoyed the Krispy Kreme factory, the one saving grace of a dismally over rated, over priced hotel.

This is a great resource for first-timers like me in a strange city (and Vegas is one of the strangest!). My wife used to manage hotels and I used to work in hotels, so I feel confident in this opinion: the Excalibur Hotel and Casino is to the Las Vegas Strip what any economy hotel is to the average city. You get everything you need (hair dryers in the rooms - irons too!), but not a whole lot else. First off, the good points. the Excalibur has excellent access to the south end of the strip: bridges to the New York, New York and MGM Grand; Trams to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay; easy walking distance to the Monte Carlo. I never saw less than six taxis lined up outside the hotel, so access to any casino or hotspot is no problem. The view I had from the 16th floor of tower 2 was outstanding - I was eye level with the roller coaster next door! Once I got past security to my tower (never was a problem), I rarely met anyone in the hallways. Things were very quiet in the hotel - even though I was told the hotel itself was over 90% capacity on the saturday night I stayed there. The \"Tournament Of Kings\" show was worth the admission. I sat next to a 4 year old boy who lived and died with every joust and fight. His reactions will be one of the highlights of my trip. He got into the show, and his excitement was contagious. Secondly, I take exception to a few other reviews on this board. I did not find the casino filled with any more smoke than any other casino I was in. I agree the hallways were darker than average hotels, but not so dark that I felt uncomfortable in them. I noticed the hallways in the Luxor were darker. I also agree that the hotel could use some refinishing, but overall the facility is in good shape. Finally, there's always some things that need improvement. The dinner buffet at the Excalibur was passable, but I felt it wasn't worth the price I paid for it. The lunch buffet at the Luxor had the same problem. The overall flow of the casino needs improvement. I always found the Excalibur casino to be the most congested, most crowded and loudest casino on the strip. In their defense, the Freemont Street casinos were louder and more crowded. In fact, after the first day of our trip, we never gambled in the casino, but walked through it to other casinos. Overall, if you want to be pampered and treated to every amenity while in Vegas, this is not your hotel. I'm sure other hotels will offer more of what you want, but you will need to pay more for it. If you want a clean, comfortable place to stay with amazing access to the strip - this is your hotel. The next time we're in Vegas, we'll definately consider staying at the Excalibur.", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMagic and funny !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4024459", "Content": "A good place for the family.

The Excalibur is a perfectly fine place to stay and it would be considered great if it was your only choice.

That being said, the best things about Excalibur are the low room rates and its great location. You can easily walk to Luxor, MB, NYNY, MGM, Showcase Mall, and we even hoofed it up Las Vegas Blvd all the way to Caesar's, passing Alladin, Paris and Bellagio on the way. (Had to take a taxi back!) Expect to do a lot of walking so wear comfy shoes. We arrived in LV the day after Labor Day. There were almost no kids except our own 10 year old. There was no line at the check-in counter! We got a great room ($69.95) on the 26th floor of Tower 2 with a great view of NYNY and its roller coaster (barely heard it). Tower 2 is your best bet especially if you want to use the pools a lot. You simply take the elevator down, cross the hall, go down a corridor and out to the pool. No hike in your bathing suit through the casino! There is also a convenience store and coffee shop just steps from the elevator. The room was clean. The bathroom too. It was however stark. Just the basics and no extras except for some mini toiletries, an ice bucket w/plastic cups, and iron/board and hairdryer. No fridge, no morning paper, no coffee pot. Towels are thin but plentiful. Pillows are small and spongy. We left $10.00 and a note for the maid to bring us 2 more pillows and an extra blanket. We met her after coming back from breakfast and she cheerfully provided both. She even left us extra towels. Nothing in the room was broken or smelled funny. Nothing leaked, squeaked or rattled. The a/c was a little loud when it kicked on but that was it. The halls were chilly but clean and dimly lit, yes, but that's part of the medieval theme. No trays were seen left out and elevators were speedy. Tip: Soda machine near elevator has bottled water a whole dollar cheaper than shops downstairs. The casino itself is huge. The ceiling is low and it feels very confusing . Signs are around to help you find your way through the maze. The arcade is downstairs. It seemed kind of dingy and it smelled musty from the fountain. Our child loved it anyway but claimed that NYNY had the best arcade. There are lots of places to eat in the hotel, but beware, everything costs almost double what you'd expect to pay at home. We had dinner at the Regale which had great Italian food. We saw free entertainment at the Court Jester's stage which our child enjoyed. We saw the Tournament of Kings Show. Having read reviews of this, we already knew about the food and that you don't get silverware. Well, I can tell you, the food is horrible and the show isn't much better. We were incredibly disappointed. Not only that but we had front row seats and one of the kings rode around the arena with such force that his horse kicked up dirt onto the table and three people got it in their food, their drinks and in their laps! They demanded their money back but they didn't get it. About 15 minutes later, the waiter showed up with spaghetti and meatballs! So if you must go to this show, don't sit in the front row. Overall we had a great time in Las Vegas. Our main objective was just to see the city. We had never been there and it was our anniversary so we wanted to go somewhere special. Although we brought our 10 year old who found it all so very exciting, I will say that Las Vegas (and the Excalibur in particular) may appear to have child oriented things (magicians, roller coasters, arcades, lion habitats, shark tanks, etc) it is not a good place to bring kids. It's a playground for adults. Go alone. Leave the kids at home and take them to Orlando instead.

I could give some many examples but I think one will suffice: the bathroom rug doesn't match the cotton towels (as in any cheap motel) and therefore it isn't fresh-washed. It's made of nylon and they must change once every 6 months only - because it was full of body hair from previous guests. So ...you can have the picture.

Stayed at the Excalibur for the 2nd time in 3 years. Family of 5, with kids 13, 10 and 6. The hotel is very kid-friendly. Our kids (and the aprx 5000 other kids that were there the week we visited!) loved the pool, the arcade, and all the medieval themed decorations (lots of good photo-ops). Also, the food court was a huge hit; all the big-chain favorites: McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut, Krispie Kream, etc. Despite the legendary rumours of cheap Vegas foods, there were no deals at the Food Court. Expect to pay about 25% over what you'd pay \"back home\". Besides the food-court, there are several sit-down restaurants in the hotel. We ate at a steak-house (Camelot), and I was shocked at how good the experience was...service was attentive, food was perfectly prepared, and the atmosphere was fairly peaceful, given the craziness of the mass humanity just outside the doors. I was also a bit shocked at the bill; about $150 for dinner for two, with a few drinks. Safety and security seemed adequate. Given the size of the hotel (5000 rooms), and the sprawling lay-out of the casino, it's a bit easy to get disoriented, but it never feels over-whelming. Just pause, take a deep breath, look around, and you'll eventually find where you're going. The casino offers all the usual games, and does have some very low limits, on a few of the tables. Of course, as the crowd grows (say, 10 or so at night), the minimums start rising. Still, a pretty good place, if you're a low-roller, like us. Staff was generally friendly and helpful, although we did encounter a few dealers who looked like they would rather be anywhere else, than dealing us cards. Even as they were sucking away our money hand-after-hand, some of them couldn't crack a smile. On the other hand, there were many who were very engaging (as they sucked up our money). Check-in was uneventful, but we arrived very late (1:00 a.m.). Given the time, they were unable to accommodate our request for connecting non-smoking rooms. For the 1st night, we had smoking rooms, then switched to non-smoking, with a fabulous view, up on the 17th floor. On other days, it looked like you needed to be Job, in order to check-in without having a melt-down. Check-out via the kiosk was very easy. Rooms were adequate. Nothing fancy (not even a tub, if you consider that a frill; just shower stalls), but for the time we spent there, perfectly adequate. There is an element of you get what you pay for... Vegas itself seems to be undergoing a transformation. After many years of hard work to promote itself as more \"family friendly\", I think the accountants have taken over the casinos...elaborate, free family shows, with expensive props don't generate revenue; gamblers generate money. Compared with our visit 3 years ago, it seemed every casino had scaled-back the free productions. There is still a lot to see in Vegas on the cheap, but it's noticeably down-sized in scope and scale, compared to a few years ago. Still, just walking up and down the strip is a lot of fun. Watch-out for those summertime temperatures, however...we saw highs of almost 120F, with night time lows of about 98F(!). One night, we were walking around at 10:00 at night, and it was 108F! Well, at least it's a dry heat... The pools were a great relief from the heat, and all the kids really seemed to enjoy the slides. Note that, although adults are certainly ALLOWED in the pool, there were just as certainly not many of them actually IN the pool. All in all, I can heartily recommend the Excalibur for families, or for those who are economizing on their accommodation costs in Vegas. This is not the right hotel for everyone (please stay away if the sight of swarms of children having fun makes you ill, or if your primary purpose in Vegas is to gamble in a high stakes environment), but for what it is, it is fine. Please note that although on the strip, the Excalibur is almost at one end. It's a fair hike to middle strip, and to walk to the other end (Stratosphere) would be out of the question for some families. Cabs, Monorails and buses are all readily available.

The interior is also decorated to a castle theme, it is over the top but after all it is Vegas. The room we had was very spacious for the four of us. Two large comfortable beds, two chairs, table, large television and plenty of storage, again all done in a tasteful castle theme. The bathroom was large with huge walk in shower cubicle. The room was immaculate on arrival and kept that way by the daily maid service. Towels were changed daily, as were sheets if required. The air conditioning was good, a little noisy but most are.The only real problem we had,was that our keycard failed to work a few times in the first few days. However, it was sorted promptly. Security was very good, keys were checked before access to the lifts to the rooms. The corridors were clean and again lighting was in the castle theme, but unlike previous reviews suggested, it was not too dark. We were in Tower two, fourth floor, the view was not great but we did not pay for a room with a view. It did have it's advantages, however, to a room on a higher floor. It was much quicker in the lifts not having to stop at lots of floors. Tower two is also in my opinion the better tower as access to the pool is easy. The other Tower means a trek across the casino floor when in need of a cooling off. The pools were brilliant, one has two slides for the children and two waterfalls, the other is larger but less fun. There were always plenty of lifeguards on duty. My favourite part of the pool complex was the hot tub jacuzzi. Seating about 30, it was like sitting in a hot bath with powerful bubble jets at back and leg level. What a great way to ease those aching muscles after walking the strip. Not to be missed! There were plenty of food choices in the Excalibur. The buffet for breakfast and dinner was good, although, you can eat too much. The food court was excellent for the children and adults, with McDonald's, Quizno's, Pizza Hut, cold stone ice-cream, Krispy Kremes and Manchu Wok. Service, food and cleanliness were all excellent. We did not have chance to try all the fine restaurants but they looked excellent. The shops were good offering a large selection of reasonably priced gifts.

Tip: best price is to go to the official Excalibur website and reserve your room online. I looked at the other sites and they were all higher. Your credit card will be charged for the first day as a deposit, however. Also, the Pyramid Cafe in the Luxor next door is a very reasonably priced place to eat if you want a change of pace.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3729262", "Content": "After reading some reviews of this hotel I wasn't impressed - it put me off before I had even got there and we were staying for two weeks, but upon arriving the staff were friendly enough and the room was clean and tidy the maid came everyday - clean towels, sheets that kind of thing, all in all I thought the hotel was good value for what we paid and would go back again.

All 5 kids range in between 5-10 years of age. We chose Excalibur since my mom and sister had stayed there before with the kids last year and they really enjoyed it. I thought it would easier to post a highs and lows review. Highs: The pool is awesome. Plenty of lifeguards and the two slides were huge hits with the kids. The snack bar was very convenient with great items, like a wonderful Fruit plate with grapes, melons and kiwi. My boys loved the chili cheese fries. We rented a float while there and that added to the fun. The hours are 8am-8pm, which was very convenient. We went to the pool 4 out of our 6 days there and never had trouble finding at least 3 chairs together. There is also quite a bit of shade on the slide side. We never played on what we called the \"adult\" side, since the slides were so fun. The arcade was great fun and the kids won so many stuffed animals, including a huge pony. After some touring around town, we found the Excalibur's arcade prices better at $1 a game vs. NY NY and we won more easily at Excalibur. Great photo opportunities throughout the hotel for the kids with knights and dragons. This was very exciting to them. Location of the hotel was the best for sightseeing. We were able to tour NY NY, MGM with the M&M factory nearby, the Tropicana's Titanic tour and then back to the Excalibur all by taking the walkways above the strip. Much safer feeling overall. We loved the easy walkway to the Luxor also. What a great hotel. My oldest son, especially loved the pyramid and all the Egyptian touches. The food court was very convenient and had a good selection with McDonald's, Pizza Hut, a coffee cafe, cold stone ice-cream and the best, still hot Crispy Creme donuts. Connecting rooms and tower II location to the pool. We were on the 4th floor with a great view of the NY NY rollercoaster, too bad the kids were too small to ride it. Plus, $12.50 a person is a bit ridiculous. The guards were very diligent about being sure no one got on the elevators without showing a key. We loved having connecting rooms for the kids to enjoy each other more and have the convenience of one adult babysitting while the others went downstairs for gambling. Lows: Checking in was very stressful due to the hotel having a different rate than what I was quoted. I had booked all three rooms so I had all the confirmations and rates written out. They were charging us about $75 more per room for the week, but after about 30 minutes of going back and forth with the manager, it was resolved. I just thought it was a waste of energy and a bad start to visit. The buffet was absolutely terrible for lunch. A complete waste of money. Comments: I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas, including my favorite the Venetian and all of them are smoky. Just a fact, folks. Excalibur was not any smokier than any others. My clothes and hair always smell like smoke in Vegas, it's not the hotel's problem. We apparently had record breaking temperatures on Tues. 7/19, but it didn't bother any of us. We were in the pool from 10am-4pm, then napped and headed out for dinner. It's the desert, make the most of it. By the way, not one of us had any sunburn since we used 35 plus and reapplied every hour and half or so. The babysitting center at Kid's Tyme at the Orleans was great. The kids loved it. The three adults ate at the Steakhouse, which was fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone. Nice casino to gamble in too.

Valet parking took almost 45 minutes from when we first arrived at the hotel. The hotel check-in line resembled an airport line.....it made the post office lines seem like nothing! Unfortunately, Excalibur reward club members were not given a priority line and had to stand in the cattle line. Luckily I spotted self-service check-in machines, where I was able to collect my keys and coupons with little effort and only a 20 min. wait (I did have to go back to the lobby to obtain an additional key though). I stayed in Tower 1 on the 17th floor. Quite a trek from the lobby, dodging slot machines and smoking gamblers. Apparently Excalibur keeps their rates down by skimping on the air in the elevators (there is none), making it a long trip up to the 17th floor. The trip back down from the 17th floor to the casino resulted in no less than 6 stops down in a hot, crowded space, picking up people from lower floors. Our room was a about as far away from the pool as you could get...so we opted not to use it. Cruising through the casino bikini-clad did not appeal to me. Our room was low budget. The thread barren sheets and towels were stained, the pillows flat as pancakes. The bathroom rug was just plain sad. The bathroom was large but lacked a tub. No coffee machine, frig, or safe. There was a large spider web hanging from the ceiling onto the lamp above the table. The maid walked in on my son the first day because there was not a privacy sign (I left a note for one and more towels....each day I had to ask for more towels). I got up early to avoid the line at the breakfast buffet...however, even arriving 20 min. before they opened did not help (there were about 20 people ahead of me). One phrase for the $9.99 breakfast buffet.....\"Save your money!\"...that is unless you like powdered eggs and very poor quality food. For $2 more, you can eat at the Rio and have a totally awesome quality breakfast! Warning: do not leave any belongings behind. An hour after checking out and on the freeway, we called the hotel regarding $60 worth of memory cards left in the bedside drawer. Several days later, we called the hotel again and they were never found. The hotel did not find our loss important enough to send someone up to the room immediately. The best thing about the place was the casino. The slots were great as well as the tables. The dinner show with horses and sword fighting was really awesome. I would go back to the casino and the show...my 13 year old son loved it! The food at the show was mediocre. I paid aprox. $110 for one night and $65 for my other two nights.

This made the week more comfortable for us knowing that our blanket, pillows & sheets were clean. Plus we brought our cooler to store water & drinks. The rooms Renaissance decor wasn't over done. The bathroom had oversized showers with sliding doors. Which was very nice in my opinion. Not one to like shower curtains sticking to me when showering. Sinks were wide, and lots of space to sit things. The only thing bad about our room, was the air conditioner was so noisey it would wake the dead.

My only complaint about the room was that it was only on the 3rd floor, so we didn't get much of a view (we were facing NYNY) I would have thought the Deluxe rooms would have been on higher floors with decent views, but it wasn't a problem, as we only slept there! During our stay we ate at breakfast at the Sherwood Forest cafe, the food and service here was good, obviously not award winning, but it doesn't claim to be. We had an evening meal at the Steakhouse at Camelot and Sir Galahads Prime Rob, both of which were lovely meals with exceptional service. We also ate at the Regale Italian restaurant, the food here was lovely, but I don't know if we went on a bad night, as the service wasn't up to much. The food court comes in handy for the odd snack when you're peckish, there are a number of places here from McDonalds to Manchu Wok. The location of the Excalibur is fantastic with walkways to the Luxor and NYNY. And the monorail stops at the MGM, across the road. We found the monorail the best way to get around. We used the number 301 bus a couple of times, but this is a LONG journey, it stops at pratically every hotel along the strip and every man and his dog gets on at each stop.

It was all we could do to run in and out to New York New York just to get away. I thought there were laws about children being on the casino floor, but apparently not. There was no enjoying the casino in this hotel, not even Keno, because it felt like a day care with kids running around and babies parked nearby at Keno while parents played games etc. One even changed her baby right there in the Keno area! Disgusting! The room was pleasant, it didn't smell moldy or musty, but the water pressure in our room was abysmal. The shower felt like a tinkle, it took forever to rinse out my hair and the toilet; well let's just say that when it takes literally 5 flushes to take care of #1, we ended up trekking down to the casino floor restrooms because none of us wanted to have issues. It was quite an inconvenience! 2 pillows for 2 double beds and 4 people was also rough. Having to use the comforter as a pillow was a trial, but at least the A/C worked, although we would have preferred that the maid not shut it OFF every time she came to take care of the room! We kicked it down a bit the next day, came back and the room was stifling again, so instead of relaxing in our room, we had to crank the A/C and trek down to the casino floor to let the room cool off. We didn't even attempt the pool or hot tub, the amount of kids there made it not even worth the effort; I can't see how it would have been relaxing at all. All night long we had to listen to kids playing WWF in the room(s) above us and thundering up and down the halls at all hours. The bars were kind of shady, too.

The Casino was huge, lively and fun, although it reeked of smoke. We received a coupon at checkin for a two for one buffet dinner and found that to be a good value.

I booked the room on Excalibur's website and paid around $45 per night with some freebies thrown into the deal. I found the hotel to be nicely decorated, although it is a basic, standard room. I was pleasantly surprised that even at that low rate I had a nice view of the pool from my room on the 11th floor of Tower 2. The maid service was thorough and efficient and the room was always kept very clean. I didn't go to Las Vegas to spend my days in my hotel room, and, therefore, Excalibur was fine for my needs. It's a budget-to-moderate hotel, basic and standard, no frills. I didn't care for the pool scene at all. Crowded, noisy, not at all relaxing. If you are looking for a good value and plan on spending the bulk of your time and money on entertainment, gambling, various restaurants, and sites in and around Las Vegas, you might give Excalibur a try. Its low rates will give you the extra money to do just that. However, if you are looking for a hotel room that is luxurious, I doubt that Excalibur will fit the bill for you. I wouldn't recommend it at all for those who are eager to experience a pleasant pool scene either. Be honest and realistic about what you want out of a hotel room. If you want real luxury, try Bellagio, Venetian, or the new Wynn. If luxury isn't first and foremost, think about Excalibur.

Just hope it is not too long or too boring. Tuesday April 5th Early morning flight \"way too early!\" Had to leave home at 4:15 am. We arrived in Vegas at 8:33 am from Texas, bought a round trip Bell Trans shuttle ticket. We will never do that again. See why later in this report. Went to the Excalibur, where they could not have been nicer. We had VIP registration, so the process took all of 5 minutes. However, because we arrived at such an early hour our room was not ready. They told us to come back in a few hours. We put our luggage on hold until a room was ready. we went to the Luxor for breakfast. They have a scrumptious breakfast. As far as I am concerned, the Luxor has the best breakfast on the strip. Came back at 10:30 and our luggage had been brought to our room. The room faced the Luxor, so we had a pleasant view of the pyramid and sphinx. We played the slots, roamed around the south end of the strip. Then decided to go to the Rivera to see Splash, which was quite entertaining. Especially if you like dancing to the 80's music. The ice skaters were incredible. We made the unfortunate choice of having dinner at the Rivera buffet. The cold food was hot; the hot food was cold, and none of the main dishes very appetizing. The prime rib was dry and tasteless, the salad wilted, and sweets have seen better days and were stale. We ate dinner at 6:30 pm, therefore, I expected the food to be fresh. After Splash, we gambled at the Rivera and I actually won $35.00. We joined their slot club, they give you $10.00 free & you can use any slot machine at the Rivera, not just special slots that you never win on. In fact, this is how I won my $35.00. Then we went to slots are fun. I won another $15.00 nothing big but at least not a loss. Husband lost money. Went over to Circus Circus, just to see what was going on. Took the metro bus back to the Excalibur. I love riding the bus; you meet such nice people from all over the world. Gambled a little more, I came out $23 ahead for night. Husband lost... A little about the Excalibur. The staff was terrific. Everyone was extremely helpful and cordial. As I said, our room faced the Luxor. There was a strange phenomenon occurring, it was \"moth\" season. There were notes on the windows to keep them closed. Well, if anyone has seen the pyramid, you know there is a big spotlight on the top. There were millions of moths caught up in the light. It was so out of the ordinary that the local TV news broadcasted the occurrence. I took pictures, but all you can see is a huge white line going into the sky. Our room was exceptionally clean, no dust, bed was comfy, and bathroom immaculate. No bathtubs, but I take a shower anyway. It is true that the hallways are dark, but that is all tied into the medieval theme. The one thing I do appreciate is that there is a guard at each of the room entrances. You must show your room card to get in. I was easy to remember, because I had my arm in a cast, but the guards verified my card every time I went up to the room. Wednesday April 6th - After breakfast at the Luxor, we decided to rent a car and drive out to the Valley of Fire. The Valley of Fire State Park is located in the Mojave Desert approximately 50 miles from LV. The park has amazing rock formations that are 150 million years old. The red rock and sand are beautiful. You follow the 15-mile sightseeing trail. There is a $6.00 park entrance fee. Take your camera; some of the Valley is breathtaking. We took the long way back approximately 75 miles riding along Lake Mead, although you couldn't see the lake most of the time, but the desert was beautiful. The desert flowers were all in bloom. I have photos if anyone is interested. We went to Hoover Dam, which is the largest reservoir in the U.S. The dam was not open; I did not find it very picturesque. Went back to the strip for dinner at the Excalibur. We enjoyed this dinner, the prime rib was perfect, shrimp pealed and ice cold, and ribs were tender. The buffet had many choices. Lots of veggies for salad, Mexican and Asian food also. The desserts were wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the carrot cake and custard filled pastries. We went to see the Freemont Street Experience downtown. It was o.k. Lots of noise and big crowds. We played the slots at Binions, which is small, dreary and dark, and at the Golden Nugget, which is huge and beautiful. Hint, if you drive to downtown, park in Golden Nugget's garage. Get your ticket validated, by the cashier cage and the first 3 hours of parking is free. We both lost on the slots downtown. Went back to the Excalibur. I won $20, husband lost again. We called it a night. Thursday- April 7th Ate breakfast at the Excalibur. I would not recommend having breakfast there. Eggs & waffles were cold. They did not have a buffet with many choices. We are not accustomed to paying $10.00 each, [although it was comped.] for cereal, coffee and fruit. Oh, and the morning coffee was dreadful, very weak. The dinner coffee was strong, I guess they wanted to keep everyone wide eyed and bushy tailed for gambling through he night. I learned how to play craps. There is an 11:00 am class everyday. Confusing but fun. I took a walk to Tickets 2night. The strip was very crowded Unfortunately, they did not have any shows available that we wanted to see. Therefore, I walked down to the Harley store, where there is another Tickets 4tonight. They had some different shows, but I did not buy any tickets. I think I was too tired from our excursion the day before. The weather was perfect. 68 at night to mid 70's during the day. Walked over to the Bellagio, roamed around the shops, although I did not buy anything. My husband has a hard time walking long distances, so he did not walk the strip with me. When I got back to the Excalibur, we strolled over to N.Y, N.Y. Husband finally won. He bought some shirts at the Harley shop, with the money he won. I bought a shirt at the NY experience shop. That shop has cute stuff, reasonably priced. Every time we go to Vegas I buy something there. Friday April 8th - last day. Had breakfast at the Luxor, Yum! I played the penny slots at Luxor & won $20.00 several times, playing 10 rows at a time. A 10 cent machine. I did not play the picture games; I played the bars and 7's. Husband really had horrible luck this trip. He lost again. At noon, I called Bell Trans, on my cell phone, to make our reservations for 5:00 pm to the airport. They had me on hold 32 minutes. When I mentioned it to the dispatcher, she was rude. We checked out and put our luggage on hold, played the slots. I actually came out $57.00 ahead. Husband lost his ----. Overall, we had a good time. Our room and all meals within the Mandalay group were comped. The drinks at all the hotels have improved, they now serve frozen drinks, Pina Colladas, Margarita's etc. but the wait time for drinks has not improved Unless you are playing a table games. Waited for Bell Trans from 4:15 - 5:00. No transportation. Gray Line came by several times. Called Bell Trans and was put on hold again for 22 minutes this time. When dispatcher finally took the call, she was nasty. Told me I must have missed the bus! Then said I'll send another but \"you better be out there this time!\" I will never take Bell Trans again! When the shuttle bus came, I mentioned this to the driver; he said he was never called to pick us up. And right then and there reported the dispatcher to his supervisor for rudeness. At the airport, I was thoroughly checked because of the cast on my arm, which I did not mind because it is a safety issue. We took America West, which had a stop in Phoenix. The first plane was small and uncomfortable, only 4 seats across. The second roomy. However, when we landed we found out that they lost my husbands luggage, but knew where it was. They were supposed to deliver the luggage on Saturday morning. If you want to know the ordeal of getting his luggage, e-mail me deemaxx95@yahoo.com You won\u2019t believe what happened.

The place is huge with thousand of tables and you never wait and it's very clean, everywhere inside the hotel. Would I go back there? Yes, but for money reason only as I don't think Excalibur deserve to charge more than 100$ a night for being an average hotel.

Room service was a lil slow but very great. Halls were full of used towers and dishes making the appearence very 'ghetto'. The pool was so very long but dont why do they have lifeguards? If your 3 feet or less you may need it...so dont expect to get any swimming in. Go to another hotel. Eating? Well the buffets where good, again to many kids. They had the basic food places. And the upscale spots were average and in no way 'impressive'. Again go to another hotel. And if your asking me..waht about such and such...my answer is go to another hotel. Oh and go to another hotel. Now again if you want to stay cheap, bring all your 14 offsprings and eat whatever, then dont go to another hotel. Stay here. Or if you just want a cheap room to drink & gamble...stay here. Or if you want a cheap room and dont really plan on staying in it because you want to go spend all your time at a better hotel gambling and drinking then stay here.

There was no bath tub and they have a sign stating that the Excalibur is into conservation of the towels so that they will only replace any towels that were found on the floor. So in the future, if you need to get a new towel set, throw them on the floor after your shower. I would recommend the hotel if anybody is low on cash and will not spend any time at the hotel.

Firstly, we got a fabulous deal through Expedia - amazingly cheap for a 4 star, however, when we decided we would like to stay an extra night we were informed we would get a 'special, preferenece rate'. As it turned out, it was quite a bit more expensive than we'd originally paid. Suffice to say we didn't bother. FIRST ADVICE - Book all the nights you need before you go. Secondly, we decided not to eat in the buffet as we wanted table service, so we decided to eat in Sir Gallahads. The restaurant is nicely done out and the service is good. I was, however, very disappointed with the food. The price was above average and what I recieved was a very rubbery piece of chicken with what I SWEAR was SMASH (instant mashed potatoes).

I will say that based on some of the reviews, this hotel was a little better than expected. They do, however, need new mattresses. The room was OK. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pool was alright. They actually have 2 different pools. The deepest part is only 3.5 ft. which was a little disappointing for our 11 year old, but he made do. It is a very nice setting with several waterfalls. We had no problem getting chairs regardless of what time we went. The arcade was one of the better ones we visited. They had plenty of different kinds of games and most of them worked. We visited the Roundtable Buffet for breakfast and it was great, we were actually there right around 11:00 AM and they changed over to lunch and there were no problems with your being able to get whichever you wanted. I highly recommend the Tournament of Kings, we had front row seats in the center and the food was good. I mean as good as chicken, broccoli and steak fries can be. The show is interactive in the sense that they bring the crowd into the story, it really was fun. As to the overall value of the Excalibur, the price was right, however, the hotel is beginning to be a little run down. Considering how much time you actually spend in your room it still was probably a better value than some. When we return to Vegas, we will probably stay some where else, just because.

Before we arrived in vegas, I had read some poor reviews but ended up booking and staying here anyways. My mistake. Upon arriving at the hotel we waited in line for approx. 30 minutes to check in, I did notice the Kings Window(express check in) moved quick, but couldn't figure out how to prearrange that. I called the Hotel and waited on hold for 20 minutes without ever speaking to a real operator. The girl at the desk was nice and we declined a room with a view, didn't pay the extra 10 bucks. Our room was in tower 2 on the 22 floor and looked directly at tower 1(poor view) although we could see abit of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The room itself was terrible. I am not usually one to complain, however, Upon entering the room we were shocked at how musky and old it smelled, hard to explain, but it reeked of dog and old carpet smell. the bathroom was large, but just had a shower. the Air Conditioning unit was the biggest problem. It worked fine other than the fact it was extremely loud, couldn't fall asleep while it was running, and it didnt have climate control. By the end of the 2nd day morning my nose started to bleed because it was so dry and the air was in dire need of moisture/humidity. The cleaning ladies did a decent job, i feel sorry for them that they have to work in those wretched smelly rooms all their lives. 2 of the mornings we woke up and left our room to find beer bottles in the hallways and elevators. The staff did seem friendly and they did have a security check in at the bottom of each tower and only allowed hotel guests up the elevators. We ate at a few a places in the hotel over the 4 days; Sherwood Forrest cafe was decently priced and offered large portions 24/7, the buffet wasn't exactly the greatest for 18 dollars a plate. The McDonalds/Pizza Hut/Quizinos etc on the 2nd floor was overpriced but quick service. Too many kids in the hotel(yes it is a family hotel, but in my opinion Vegas is not for kids). Not much to do/see in the excalibur itself other than the castle games floor(for kids). Sports book at the Excalibur was brutal, they didn't offer prop bets like the other REAL Sports Book casinos, and the odds were never as good as NYNY or MGM, i compared these closely. Slots were pretty tight for us, never played the tables, didn' like the general atmosphere because of all the small children and to get anywhere in the casino you have to go directly through all the tables and slots. Pool was nice and fitness center/spa was great! Brand new and clean, lots of new equipment. Tram to Luxor and Mandalay bay was nice however those hotels didnt have much to offer either. The Excalibur is a good place to stay if you like looking at children hanging around smokey casinos until the wee hours of the morning. It is too far south on the strip and is a good 45 to 1 hour walk or 12 dollar cab ride to Strip central. If you want to cheap out in vegas stay at the Flamingo, Ballys or Imperial palace.

The hallways are lit with lanterns to give you the feel of midevil times. The Buffet was wonderful; breakfast was better than dinner, but too bad they didn't have an omlete making station (but prime rib, yum!). The food court was convenient. The walkway to Luxor was time saving. Our room, tower 1, had a beautiful view down to the Eiffel Tower of Paris; and we didn't even ask for a view. They had a great variety of games in the casino, and their players club had some good comps. The pool area was beautiful, but I agree with the reviews about the lounge chairs. They need to buy about 100 more chairs. It is murder trying to find somewhere to sit. You have to walk all around the pool and stake people out that look like they are leaving. When they know the hotel is at capacity, they should definately increase staff and things like pool chairs.

We now know what previous reviews stated about the noises in the plumbing and we are not talking about your typical shower running or toilet flushing. There was actually sounds that the pipes made. Looks like the pipes are in need of servicing. FYI, there is only a shower no tub, but the shower is big. The security guards at each entrance to the elevators, to go to the rooms, was made you feel secure. The buffet looked good, but was bland.

We did not attend the Tournament of Kings as we had done that before, but if you attend I am sure you will like it. However, don't expect a lavish dinner.

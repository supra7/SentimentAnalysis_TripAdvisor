Booked directly from the hotel, no issues with check-in. Staff were friendly and courteous. The room: we stayed in unit 164, an upgraded unit with ocean views from the main level patio. Room was generally in good shape except for a few things, and was well situated close to the second or lower tiered pool, giving me that all-important direct ocean view from the patio area. Otherwise, the room was pretty unremarkable. No wireless in the room, however, the internet cable was long enough to reach our laptop on the patio. Our room had a queen bed in the bedroom, and a double and single pullout (we noticed some people with 6 people or more in rooms). The resort: The best thing about this resort is not the rooms but the location. Situated directly on the ocean, with two large pools and a hot tub (we used this lots even though its Maui), we were close to some great snorkling on a cove just a 3 minute walk away, and only 1 minute by foot to a beautiful sandy beach. It was handy having the Gazebo Restaurant on location as well (best breakfast ever), however, be prepared to wait in line as much as 15 minutes. For us with our kids, we were really happy to see many other younger couples with kids all over the place, and were able to let our kids run around in the big open grassy area where we could watch them and the whales in the ocean from our patio. If you are looking for quiet and relaxing, this isnt the place for you (try Napili Point next door). During the days the pools were full of kids, and they were running around everywhere. There was definately a younger feel to this resort which we liked, and just sitting by the pool you could chat someone up easy enough. The resort also has a great lounging spot right up by the ocean where alot of people would sit and watch the whales and the surf. Maintenance and groudskeeping were very good, and the grills were always cleaned and well maintained. Although we never had any issues, were heard some people complain about the lack of parking. Food at the other restaurant on the resort was average, however, prices were fairly good. When reading reviews about this resort, alot of people complained about all the kids, or, kids under 5 being in the hot tub. There were certainly alot of energetic kids running around (mine included), and people seemed to disregard the kids under 5 in the hot tub rule. In summary, though the rooms were nothing special in my opinion, we had a great time and would certainly come back. The resort was very friendly, and optimally situated in my opinion. I thought prices were a little high for a one bedroom though, larger 2-bedroom units are available at other resorts if you look around a bit, however, this resort is well located, which is important too. Do in Maui: highly recommend the Road to Hana (stop at the Lava Tubes, the Black Sands beach (jump in the hidden pools down the path to the right), and The Seven Sacred Pools) , a Luau, renting a convertible, visiting Front Street in Lahaina, going whale watching, snorkling Molikini, trying a Mai Tai, visit the aquarium in Ma'alea (spelling?) visiting the blowholes north of Napili, taking a surfing lesson, and visiting Fleming Beach (be careful in the big waves). Check out Bubba Gump's on Front Street in Lahaina, also, the two storey burger place next to it (cant remember name). Be sure to get a seat upstairs for the live music.

It is a short walk to Napili Bay which doesn't have a good beach for lounging, but it is good for swimming. Kapalua Bay is 5 minutes drive North and is great for families and snorkeling! The Outrigger is 5 minutes drive from Napili plaza and market- but buy all your groceries at Costco close to airport when you arrive, otherwise you will be blown away by cost! One downside of this location is there are NO sidewalks around resorts, so going out for a morning stroll or after dinner is a bit dangerous- definitely not good for walking the stroller or with small children. THE RESORT: The grounds of this condo resort are very well manicured, with two pools and a jacuzzi. We stayed in Garden View Condo unit #134. So this review reflects just that condo, all are owned separately and can be varying quality. Even though it was close to the onsite restaurant, it was still very quiet. I can imagine the units closest to the Gazebo (nearest the ocean) could be a little noisy in the morning as that restaurant always had a line starting at 7 am! It was updated and modern, King size bed, flat screen TV, granite counter tops in kitchenette and bathroom, large closet in bathroom. As two people we were very comfortable in this space. The kitchenette was well equip with full size refrigerator which was great for us because we cooked almost all of our meals in condo., blender, toaster, etc. Except the two pans are TERRIBLE (too small and definitely not none stick anymore), no tupperwear present for packing lunches, so buy some or bring sandwich bags and freezer bags for food and left over storage. I would recommend this to a friend! But next time we will stay more south and in a better walking environment.

At night, I don't think I've experienced a more quiet location-it is very mellow and laid back and it seems most folks return to the resort in the early evening, so few car noises were heard. It appears that the Gazebo wholesale deliveries are in the afternoon to avoid both the restaurant crowds and disturbing guests on that side of the resort. The one bedroom condo, managed by Outrigger, was clean, well furnished and well equipped for a long stay. The new restaurant, Cafe Au Lait, is average and a bit pricey, but a real plus for tired travelers at the end of the day. This is an excellent resort for many reasons. I have to say that I find the concerns about treatment of 'children in the hot tub' overstated, as this is the policy in all the resorts I've ever known.

Second, the lower pool is not heated, so it is basically useless. The upper pool is nice, however, if you have kids, be prepared for some serious stares from the older people. Also - KIDS NOT ALLOWED IN HOT TUB!!! Very disapointing, as Napili is more windy than the rest of Maui, and it is nice for the kids to warm up.

The next surprise was the lack of air conditioning. I sleep better in a cool room, so hours after I wanted to retire, it had cooled enough that I could eventually fall asleep. Due to the lack of a/c, the ground floor sliding glass door had to remain open to get the maximum airflow. That did not encourage a deep, sound sleep. Nor did the click, click, click of the ceiling fan in the bedroom. As to privacy, forget it. I am now sitting near the middle of the living room and looking into ten other living rooms, on two floors. Abouth thirty yards away, the older couple on their lanai (patio) look through our living room, kitchen, hallway to the bathroom, and into our bedroom.

We found this Napili Shores condo complex at Napili Bay with a studio with ocean and garden view at second floor just steps from the sand beach and turtle bay. It was very clean with a maid service each 3 days, and with fully equipped kitchen. Free parking is just behind your building. This resort is located on Napili Bay, which has very nice snorkeling and a group of giant turtles that come out every morning on the rocks to the left of the sand beach. Awesome to watch! Gazebo Restaurant is on a property, but we did not try it. There are few places not far from the resort that we would recommend: 1) Turn left from the resort's gate, and drive 12 minutes, there is a great snorkeling at Kapalua Bay. You should walk through a private forest to get on a rock beach. 2) on the hill right side of this Bay is surfers area. That was interesting to watch surfers in a windy day; there is a plenty of place for the parking, just turn left on a hill from the road 3) Drive further, there is a Blown Hole place, you find out it by a small sign on your left just along the road. There is a quite walk down to the water, approx 20 minutes, but the view of Blown Hole is deserved it! 4) Keep driving to the next attraction - Kahakuloa Head. Be aware that HWY 30 after Blown Hole area is became extremely narrow, pretty scary to drive on, and better turn around if you are not assured in your driving skills. Kaheliki Highway is not in a good maintenance conditions. We would not recommend keep driving next behind the Blown Hole area for the beginners. Overall, that was awesome! Few tips: that place is a bit far from the major attractions like Road to Hana, Haliakala volcano, etc hence you should be leaving approx one hour earlier than from all other places on Maui. To drive to Haliakala summit took us about 3.5 hours with a few short stops for the photos. Because this place at a bottom of a small volcano, the rainy days in average are more than on the south, Kihei. Sand beach is beautiful and safety. Hiking trails are from the beach leads you along the west shore Resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s garden, pools, hot tab, BBQ areas are all absolutely amazing!

They seemed to love the place: the pools, the rocks, the beach nearby, being with their families. This is a nice, reasonably priced center for fun. Pros: Room is lovely and spacious. Kitchen comes with enough quality stuff to throw a dinner party for a half dozen people. These weren't pots and pans from Goodwill; this was stuff you'd use to cook and serve at your second home. Sizeable bathroom area. Great views. Lovely grounds with plants in bloom. Napili Bay is just a wonderful beach, with snorkeling and swimming and all the good stuff you want in a sandy beach. We usually visit the Big Island, which has rockier beaches, so we loved this aspect. Assuming you have a car, and since this is Hawaii and you have common sense, you will, there's a market nearby and some good restaurants like China Boat not far away. Cons: 1. The lack of air conditioning sucks. I don't know that it's a big deal if you have kids as the rooms are still tolerable at worst in August. Now if you're a couple ... If you plan to do ... um, what couples do ... you better have a couple that likes to do it in the morning when things are still cool, let's put it that way. You can get a nice cross breeze going but that's with the windows all wide open, so the couple also better be on the quiet side, if you know what I mean. 2. The windows wide open means you get a lot of noise, from the pools, recreation areas, or people walking the parking lot. Maui is a lot windier than the Big Island, I learned, and sometimes the cross breeze means you get the whistling of wind in the rooms. We go on dives and sleep a bit in the afternoon, but we got by. 3. You do need a car, but this is Hawaii so that makes sense. I'd stay here again in a minute though if I found a comparable place with air conditioning, I'd give it a try too.

I send a LOT of clients over to Maui, but I have never had anyone stay at this Outrigger property before. I wanted to try something different and a little more 'off the grid' for our honeymoon, and I have heard good things about the Napili area. My husband and I just got back from our honeymoon in Maui at the Outrigger Napili Shores (July 25-31). Words and pictures will never be able to describe how beautiful everything was. We were SO pleased with our accommodations at the Outrigger Napili Shores. We were in a garden view studio (the cheapest room), and it was everything we could have asked for. Nice interior decor, kitchen, bathroom, etc. Fully stocked with all the dishes we needed and a fridge. There is no air conditioner at this resort, however, we NEVER missed not having it. There are screened porches and balconies for every room, we just left ours open the entire trip. The resort has a great breakfast/lunch place called the Gazebo that is WONDERFUL (try the POG). There is a place open Tuesday-Saturday for dinner on site that was also very good and we ate at two nights. There are two very nice pools on site (if that's your thing, we always swam at the beach though). Also, you can sit in the patio area and see the most beautiful sunsets. You look out towards the west and it sets right over Molokai. Napili bay itself is absolutely beautiful. In front of the resort is a reef where sea turtles and other marine life hang out at (great snorkel spot also, try Boss Frog's in Napili Marketplace a few blocks away for cheap rentals). The sandy bay is adjacent to the reef and perfect for swimming and just hanging out. Attractions worth doing while in Maui that we did: 1) Pride of Maui Molokini and Turtle Town snorkel cruise (more expensive than others, but very nice lunch and drinks included! The staff was absolutely wonderful and very friendly). Also drop by the Maui Aquarium in Maalaea after the cruise for a neat experience, it's in the same parking lot as the harbor. 2) Twin Falls on the Road to Hana (First stop on the highway, we were told if you can only do part of the road, do Twin Falls). Wear your swimsuit so you can swim at the falls! Pack a lunch and visit Haleakela in the same day. 3) Haleakela (We drove from Twin falls on a little highway that hooked up to Haleakela highway and did the crater on the same day, worked out VERY well. Be prepared to bring long pants and a jacket because it was very cold and windy when we went, but still worth the drive). 4) Merriman's restaurant in Kapalua (Walking distance from the Outrigger Napili Shores, very expensive, but TOTALLY worth the money. You need reservations! All the locals said this place was better than Mama's Fish House). I will definitely recommend this property to individuals who are looking to be a little outside of town (only a 15 minute drive to Lahaina) and feel a little more secluded. Perfect if you just want something simple and a little more remote feeling than a high-rise property. Beautiful scenery, great food, great excursions! The property itself prices VERY well compared to some other units in the Lahaina area, so you have plenty leftover for great meals and day-trips.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful views, poor service.\u201d", "Author": "Redwinelvr", "ReviewID": "UR115731655", "Content": "We recently took a family trip to Napili Shores.

It doesn't matter at all that the shores is not DIRECTLY on the beach.

We initially tried Napili Bay and didn't see any but there were soo many at Napili Point, they were really beautiful to see. * The resort it general is just very laid back. You can't help but relax. Cons: * No bar at the pool. I'm not sure why the Gazebo isn't licensed. We felt this was the one thing missing. It would be so nice if you could have a cocktail and even order some snacks while you are relaxing there. * Not a great deal of eateries within walking distance. There is the Gazebo restaurant on site open for breakfast and lunch and the Cafe O Lei on site, open for dinner. There is also the Seahouse restaurant at the nearby Napili Kai (great happy hour), but other than that I don't think there is anywhere else that would be walking distance. But I suppose that is what the kitchen facilities are for! We were tossing up between staying here and the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. There is definately more \"going on\" in Kaanapali as all the resorts are all next to each other right along the beach. It really just depends what you think would suit you better. I'm glad we chose Napili Bay instead because I liked that it was more secluded. We had a hire car so still visited Kaanapali (10 min drive). The bus is only $2 return if you don't have a car and it stops right out front of the Napili shores. *** Lastly, Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the dinners we had at the Cafe O Lei restaurant.

There's usually a huge line up so give them a call 10 minutes ahead and you can just pick up your food and eat it on your balcony (or where you like, of course). Our room was very tidy. Although the hotel is on the older side, everything is kept updated and clean. We stayed in an ocean front room which is perfect if you don't mind the sound of the waves (we didn't, we loved it!!!). I think it's great that the rooms don't have A/C. Thus you're \"forced\" to keep the windows open and you hear the ocean all the time. Non-ocean front rooms are probably rather garden view than ocean view so treat yourself with an ocean front room - it's so worth it. We loved to sit on the balcony, have breakfast and see the humpback whales swimming by (or breaching!). The staff is very friendly. Of course, our baby (5 months) was always welcome :) Also, we liked the fact that housekeeping is only every three days. It made it much more relaxed as we wanted to stay out of the sun during noon with our baby and so it was always a good idea to take a nap in the room and not being interrupted by housekeeping. Also, the dinner restaurant is quite good. We went there the last night and the seafood is great. Also the dessert (upside-down pineapple cake) is worth mentioning! Yummy!!! Long story short: An excellent hotel for people looking for a relaxed vacation. We'll definitely come back and we can recommend it to everyone!", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing and close to fun\u201d", "Author": "zafaglass", "ReviewID": "UR97534433", "Content": "My wife and I just got back a few hours ago from Outrigger and already miss it. It is a relaxing atmosphere, pretty quiet overall but close enough to places like Lahaina or Kaanapali if you want some nightlife and Hawaiian culture (ie luaus and the like). It is right on Napili Bay which is nice. Some days there were great waves for playing in and other days were very calm in the water which allowed for some great snorkeling. The beach is nice and sandy, but those aren't hard to come by in Maui. During the winter months, when the whales come around the area for mating and giving birth, you literally can see them all over the place from this area. The best times to see them were in the morning and around 5 pm or so. Nothing better than waking up in the morning, getting some of their tasty free coffee and whale watching before hitting up the days fun in the sun. The Gazebo, which is a breakfast/lunch place right on the property has some seriously amazing pancakes and the fried rice is unbelievable, not only in size but in quantity too. We only ate there once, but highly recommend it. The only downside is that there is a pretty long line every single morning. Unless you want to wait for 30 minutes or more for a meal, just call ahead, place your order, and your food is ready in 10 minutes. There are tables right next to the restaurant so it's not like you are losing the great view. If you are looking to partake in some activities I highly recommend going to the Expedia Concierge in the lobby. Eden helped us out and planned a helicopter trip and a whale watching expedition (although we couldn't go on the whale boat because my wife is 6 months pregnant and the limit is 3 months). She was great and very helpful. Other than that, I recommend Maui Tacos in Lahaina, it's very good. Also Kimo's and Moose McGillicudy's for those that have never been in the area. Oh yea, and the Sea House which is at Napili Kai (right across the beach) has awesome pupu's and cocktails.

Also the road next to hotel has no pedestrian pathway, and unless you have a rental car at your disposal at all times the road itself is not pedestrian friendly (it's downright dangerous to walk due to razor sharp curves and no pedestrian walkway). Hotel itself is very quiet so don't expect any night life. There is not much to see or do on the property itself. It does not have a gym, which would be a nice addition. It does not have air conditioning but there was plenty of trade winds that kept us cool during our stay. Hotel has two pools which were clean and well kept.

We did get a decent night's sleep on it though but coming from a Tempur-Pedic back home it's hard to compare anything to that. There are two swimming pools on the property (one with a hot tub) but we never used either one so I can't comment on that. We had no problem with parking around the resort (Napili Shores doesn't charge extra for parking like some other Resorts). The Gazebo Restaurant down by the ocean is open for Breakfast / Lunch from 7:30am-2pm and people from all around the area line up early for their food. The only issue you may have concerning parking is if you leave and come back during Breakfast Hours. Speaking of the Gazebo Restaurant, you can avoid the long wait in line if you stay here at Napili Shores. Just phone in you're order after 8am, walk down and pick it up, come back to you're room and watch everyone else stand in line while you're eating a very good Breakfast. The Maui Grill (also on the property) has a nice Dinner selection and opens at 4:30pm. We ate here on our first and last night on the Island. \"People Noise\" was never an issue for us. You will get people (non residents of Napili Shores) heading down to the Gazebo for Breakfast starting around 7am but they were for the most part respectful of the \"quiet hours\" posted around the grounds. Which leads me to my next point. Napili Shores does appeal to and draws many families with small Children (some unruly and noisy). If for some reason this bothers you or you're in the market for absolute peace and quiet you may want to look elsewhere. There is no sandy Beach in front of Napili Shores. My wife and I did enjoy walking out on the rocky shoreline and watching the small sea life that live in the small pools of the rocky shoreline. There is a nice sandy beach to the right of Napili shores that one can very easily walk to and enjoy a day in the sun. Like most of the Hawaiian Islands we've been to, it does occasionally rain but it's usually brief and a warm rain at that. Don't let it disrupt you're activities. Overall, we had a wonderful stay here at Napili shores and would return when / if we return to Maui. I highly recommend it.

This was before they remodeled. The grounds.. GORGEOUS. Everything was clean and just amazing. My mom booked a room at the Westin for one night because they had a really nice pool and water slide. We checked in and an hour later we checked out and got our money back. We went straight back to Napili shores for the rest of the vacation. The staff is amazing and so welcoming, everything is clean, the kitchen the beds were COMFORTABLE. I loved waking up to the birds and you can hear the ocean. Another thing i thought was very unique is the Gazebo. I really thought it was cool how popular it was. Plus they make the best breakfast ever.

This welcome set the tone for our visit. This is a very family-oriented place, there were a lot of families out on the grounds and at the pool which was to our liking. There were two pools (one of them had a hot tub) and Napili beach is right there. Not far away is Kapalua where there is another beautiful beach. The condo itself was very clean and updated.

If I had to give the cons about staying here that may be a problem for others but not for us I would say: 1) there's no a/c and if it was really hot or there wasn't much of a breeze it could be uncomfortable 2) if you want to stay at a place where you have a lot of privacy, this place might not suit you because as I said there were lots families with younger and older kids that spent a lot of time outside on the grounds (eg. playing ball, hanging out at the pool or on their lanai) 3) I wouldn't consider this a central location on the island. It is very close to Kanapali and Lahaina and it doesn't take long to get to these two areas, but for example if you want to go to South Maui it would take longer since you are all the way up north of Lahaina especially since the traffic can be bad. When we were staying there, there was road construction so it took a little while to get around.

My husband & I have lived on Maui for almost 10 years now & have stayed at numerous condos & hotels on the island. We took some time off work & stayed at Napili Shores for 2 nights. Rooms were nice and clean but had no ac and less than efficient fans. Their was little to no interaction with the staff, they never seem to be around. So windows are usually kept open so breezes can come through which brings all the noises of outside right inside. There were too many screaming kids at any time of the day...early morning, mid-day, when you are trying to take a nap & wee into later hours. That really killed the romance factor. Relaxing by the pool (and there are 2 pools) was also impossible as there were children taking up the entire pool, screeching & parents in their own worlds ignoring them. And this is why we tried to pick a \"quiet, couples atmosphere\" type of condo. The Gazebo restaurant is FANTASTIC & the highlight of staying there other than Napili Bay Beach which is lovely. Long wait line, but that's what happens when both tourists & locals know a great deal on a wonderful breakfast or lunch. If you want to eat in your room or lanai, call ahead and take your food to go.....avoid the lines! Nobody seems to remember that! HOWEVER the other restaurant that serves dinner on the property was one of the worst experiences we've ever had on Maui. There were only 4 tables of diners when we arrived. We were not greeted for about 10 minutes when we walked in. There appeared to be 1 VERY GRUMPY waitress handling all tables who didn't even acknowledge us. When we were finally seated she threw menus at us, offered no explainations of specials or options. Waited another 15 minutes for drinks while looking at the terrible menu selection & rip-off prices.

I am so happy I chose this place. It is small (100 units) and right on top of the ocean. There are a number of reasons why this place was so awesome.... 1. The beaches were not crowded and were clean. We were only steps away from the beach and with our ocean view room we could go to sleep hearing the waves and wake up to hearing the waves. 2. It's a little off the beaten path which is appealing to me. The downside to this is that we would have to drive a bit more to get to the main destinations, but what the heck if the condo is so good. 3. For those of you with kids, they have shuffleboard, croquet, and a huge checkerboard set (the coconut shells are the checkers pieces). We never turned on the tv once (i assume there was one in the room). 4. I wanted to stay in a condo so that I would be able to contain some of the costs of going to Maui by having a good chunk of our meals at the condo or having a decent setup so that I could make lunches to take with us. all the amenities were in the condo - just had to buy the food! 5. There are a few showers to wash the sand off so as to minimize the sand going into the condo. 6. The grounds with the koi pond and beautiful vegetation made it so restful. 7. They provided the kids with an activities bag and me with a pineapple which I thought was pretty cool. The biggest downsides: parking was sometimes not avaiable right by the condo and there isn't any A/C. For us, being from Phoenix, it wasn't an issue, but this could be a concern for some people.

We booked unit 201 in building A, which is Ocean Front - as close to the water as you can probably get anywhere, and closest to the beach path. I think that building A and second floor would have to be the best location in Napili Shores. We booked through the owner through their website found in an internet search. The unit had been remodeled and had a very modern feel to it - I loved the decorations, not your typical beach stuff. We had everything we needed for the kitchen and bathroom and for trips to the beach. Shower was small and the bathroom tended to get hot/stuffy, but the rest of the condo was kept cool with the breeze so long as windows open. It's a studio with a king bed, perfect for our honeymoon. Building A does not get traffic in front of it, but being on the second floor made it completely private. We fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the waves and the blue ocean was the first thing we saw when we woke up. The grounds were very nice and added added to the charm of the stay. The front pool felt cool, the heated pool in garden area felt better, but we spent all of our time at the beach and exploring the island. We watched most of our sunsets from Napili Bay, and it was one of our favorite places to be on the island!

Let me start with the pro's. The location is very quiet and secluded. While there are other condo's adjacent to the complex, all are only 2 or 3 stories tall and Napili Beach really feels like your own private beach - away from the masses that visit Kaanapali. The exterior of the condo is unimpressive when you pull up in the car. In fact you might even begin to have second thoughts but I have to tell you the rooms are very nice for the money. Well appointed, large, and clean. We didn't use the pool area (I'll get to that in a second) but we took advantage of the BBQ's which were in spectacular working order and clean - in fact they looked almost brand new. The property is a like a sleepy condo away from the noise - a perfect spot if you're looking to get away and really perfect for older couples or families with children. Cons: While the location was on the leeward side it was very windy. We asked a few locals about it because I've been up a Kapalua a couple of times and not experienced so much wind. They informed us that it's often windy in that area. So windy in fact that if you lay in the sand you'll get a free sandblasting. Same thing happened to us in Kaanapali so I'm guessing that perhaps we were there on a particularly windy week. We got around it by driving down to Waliea each day....the weather was AWESOME down there. No wind at all and we realized that when Napili is cloudy it's often crystal clear in Wailea. Almost every day when driving back from Wailea you'd be in the sun until you got past Kanaapali...then you'd hit the wind and clouds. Again, maybe we were just unlucky? Something you may want to think about. A second downside (which isn't a big deal for us but may be for you) is there are no nearby restaurants. We did walk up to Merriams on our last night - a new restaurant in Kapalua which was really nice but other than that you're left to traveling in to Lahaina town. Oh, and on that note, traffic on the West side has increased significantly since I was in Maui last; just another thing to keep in mind. If you cook your own food this isn't a problem. But another word of caution. Take the time to use the Safeway in Lahaina and avoid the local markets - including the Star Market. They are VERY expensive. Safeway is at least tolerable. As far as the property itself goes, overall I'd give it a \"C\". The rooms are really nice and clean but the property is a bit dated and the grounds, while well kept, are very simple as is the pool areas which because of the wind we didn't use. The beach looks fantastic and we even saw the famed Sea Turtles. Snorkeling looks to be great, but again we spent all our time in Wailea due to the winds. Overall I think this is a good property for older couples or families with children but if you're looking for a little action this is probably a \"pass\" for you. Good value for the money, good \"private like\" beach area (if you get lucky with the weather), but a bit dated, and maybe too low key for some.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cQuite area north of the island\u201d", "Author": "Caro07", "ReviewID": "UR28247339", "Content": "For those who are allergic to skyscrapers by the sea, this is the place. The resort is composed of 2-story buildings centered around a pool or facing the ocean. We had a garden view studio with a large and private balcony. We enjoyed having breakfast there with the smell of trees in bloom. The flowers were at arms reach. The full kitchen was very usefull as the breakfast was quite expensive. We would stop at a nearby grocery store on our way back to the hotel at night to enjoy dinner on the balcony too. There are a few gaz BBQ you can use at no charge near the pool area. Avoid the free ''welcome breakfast'', it's a tourist trap. We left after 5 minutes, just couldn't stand the sales pitch. The grounds were impeccable and maintained daily. The central pool is very warm and it is great to go for a swim and stare at the stars after a long day sightseeing. The resort has it's own beach, which may be a bit exposed compared to nearby bays. There were however see turtles in the breakers off the point. My best recommendation would be to jump in the car and drive to nearby Honolua bay. It is a rocky beach that you'll reach after a 5 minute walk in the forest, not suitable for children to play or to sunbathe but the snorkeling is exceptionnal. Go there early, tour boats start dropping their passengers in the water around 1030h and it can get crowded. Yes people actually pay to snorkel there. You'll be glad you drove 5minutes early in the morning and had the place to yourself and your new turtle friends (just don't touch them their protected). The bay is home to a large array of fishes and we found the turtles on the right hand side of the bay about half-way out to sea. The previous beach on highway 30 is more suited to family fun, it is nice and sandy and accessible by a long set of stairs. There was some rip current (nothing major but keep an eye on small kids). The best part! All beaches are free and public. Just park on the side of the road and walk. The late check out is worth it if you are leaving on an evening flight, as most beaches are ''wild'' I didn't see much showers to freshen up before getting on the plane. This hotel is a little north of most points of interest, but the extra drive is worth it to avoid crowds and tourists. You can almost feel like a local. Would go back again. Oh yes, you'll want to sleep with the shutters open to get a nice breeze going through the night, just don't be surprised to wake up very early every day, the birds are quite vocal and the trees just an arms length away! For those who golf, there is a world class golf course just a few miles north of the hotel. At about 130$ a night with the airline employee rate, this place is excellent value for money. Especially considering unlimited internet access and how impeccable everything is. Oh yes, one small disappointment. We had to fax some important documents internationnaly while at the hotel, I believe the charge would have been of about $35US for a 4 page fax (ok you're supposed to be on vacation but things do happen).

The beach was just a short walk (5 minutes) to the right and 5 minutes to the left was a cove full of sea turtles that may for great snorkeling.

Previous reviews had mentioned great snorkelling at the nearby beaches with plenty of turtles etc and this was the clincher for us (and proved to be true). To be honest first impressions upon arrival were not fantastic as it seemed a lot older than expected and a little dated. However this feeling did not last and as soon as we had settled into our studio apartment we began to relax and soak up the charm. The interior of the apartment was fairly modern with stone bench tops etc. The staff were very helpful and always seemed willing to help in providing advice during our stay. We ended up booking a couple of trips through the resident expedia staff member who was also very helpful and we would definitely recommend attending her presentation on your first day there - she offered good advice whether booking trips or not. We also really liked the horseshoe lay out of the place and in general there seemed to be a very social and friendly vibe, whether it was longer term time share owners or first timers such as ourselves. The central pool/spa seemed to be a bit of a hub for this. The Gazebo Restaurant seemed to be very popular for residents and visitors alike and the only thing I could attribute this to is it's ocean views. We didn't eat there but the menu looked average and the coffee looked horrid. However for coffee fans there was one of the best coffee shops we have had in the USA in the near by Napili Shopping Plaza (can't remember the name but it was in the same complex as the Taco Shop, Boss Frog Snorkel hire etc). It offered well made espresso coffee and a wide range of tasty treats. If you've got a hire car the location is fine - we were only a ten minute drive to Lahaina (where we ate most of the time) and most of the rest of the island was fairly accessible. Based on our short itinerary I think we would have been driving heaps no matter where we stayed. Given the great local conveniences such as the local beach, nearby coffee shop, friendly vibe and proximity to Lahaina, I would highly recommend Napili Shores.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay for families\u201d", "Author": "BMW902", "ReviewID": "UR23233666", "Content": "We stayed 7 days with our 4 year old daughter in August.

I could have spent day after day on our lanai, just meditating on the sound of the ocean, wishing the sunsets would never end, watching early morning paddle-boarders and people traversing the tide pools. There is a small strip of grass leading down to the rocky tide pools (divided by a chain link fence, but didn't at all detract from the view), which were so much fun to explore. I much preferred our location to the properties to the north. Because we weren't directly on the beach (only a 2 minute walk away), it was much quieter and the traffic wasn't nearly as busy.

The interior was very nicely updated with full-size appliances and a full stock of kitchen utensils. The only thing that detracts from the appearance of this property is the outsides of the buildings look dated, but they are certainly not run down. Pros: Snorkelling off of beach (just to the right of hotel and shared with other properties). Swam with a sea turtle! Very nice barbecue grills (4 on property cleaned daily by staff or use the provided brush if you don't get there first). Hot tub and heated pool (unfortunately the heated pool and hot tub are on the opposite end of the property from the ocean). I did not swim in the pool near the ocean, but I believe it is not heated. Provided beach/pool towels on check-in (soft and neutral brown). Cons: Most things are a bit of a drive. About 15 minutes to Lahaina (Front Street area). 50-60 minutes to OGG airport. 35 to 45 minutes to main tourist harbour. Notes: There are grocery stores nearby, but they are pricey. May be better to shop in Kahului on your way from airport (expecially if you are a COSTCO member). If you fly into the main airport (OGG) don't be tempted to take the apparently shorter road around the north-west end of the island. It's shorter distance-wise, but is single lane in many locations and will probably take around 2 hours versus around 50-60 minutes heading south and then back north along the west side of the island. The north-west drive is a nice sunrise drive if you have the time and your passengers aren't prone to motion sickness. There is a nice blowhole and a quaint small town along the north route. Gazebo restaurant is great, but only open until 2PM. You can walk to a restaurant at another hotel down the beach, but we didn't try. No evening bar on property. No air conditioning in room.

The room was nice inside, but there were 2 problems: first, the room overlooked one of the pools, resulting in a lot of noise; and second, the room faced away from Napili Bay. That meant that the nice cool sea breeze couldn't come in, and the un-airconditioned room was too warm for us. We upgraded to a second-floor oceanview room, and what a difference! Apart from the stunning view, the room always got a nice cool breeze and was very comfortable. We were almost cold at night!

I chose this hotel because I had read the beach waters in front were rich with Honu (The Hawaiian Green Sea Turtle). The first thing I noticed after we left the airport (OGG) was that this hotel was quite a long drive away. It is located a few miles north of the more popular & crowded resort area of Kaanapali Beach. When we pulled into the hotel it wasn't any fancy resort and the main restaurant seemed to be closed down. Once we were in our rooms though we were very happy. Our room was very large and had a full kitchen so we purchased some breakfast foods at a nearby market and ate in our room every morning. The room did not have AC but there was a nice breeze off the ocean and we never felt too hot. You can see a neighboring island (Lana'i I believe) from the hotel grounds and the sunset off the west shore was spectacular. There is a rocky beach directly in front of hotel, that if you can navigate across the rocks, has perfect snorkeling waters that are filled with Honu. About 50 yards to the right is a more traditional sandy beach shared with other neighboring hotels that is perfect to lounge, swim, and snorkel. Please enjoy the turtles here, but do not pet them or try to hold onto them. They are very large and you should do your best to stay clear of them as the waves come crashing in as their weight might knock you over! But they are amazing to watch & photograph. If that's your thing, I highly recommend this hotel. There is a small breakfast/lunch only restaurant near one of the pools but we did not eat there - it always seemed to have a crowd and I'd heard good things about it. This hotel was less expensive than many others, but still not the cheapest. We had a rental car and spent little time here but it was perfect for what we were looking for. I would say the main negative was that it was far away from everything kind of. It doesn't even really seem to be in Lahaina at all, although with most Hawaiian islands, things like this don't seem important. If you don't mind being away from the hustle & bustle of busier resort areas, I would definitely recommend. But you will need a rental car to see the rest of the island!

To keep the rooms full, Napili Shores is renting rooms to traveling construction workers. They fill the rooms with 4 or more workers -- probably to save money. The unfortunate part is that they start drinking when they get off work and hang out on the stairs. They go to bed early - 9 pm -- but wake up to head off to work around 5 am and are very noisey and creud. Surprisingly, this problem recurred 3 times.

The Shores is an older condo development, very well kept up, that offers the most significant amenities without layers of extras, and at a more reasonable cost. We observed that it attracts a horde of repeat guests and that many of the condo owners themselves spend a good part of the year in residence. The units are a mix of one-bedroom and studios with balconies, arranged in two-story buildings that mostly face an immaculately maintained central courtyard (see picture). The buildings closest to the ocean are canted to provide ocean views. The courtyard has two pools and a Jacuzzi, plus a fish pond and very attractive landscaping. At the seaside end of the courtyard the beachfront is rocky, but a short connecting path leads to a nice sandy beach immediately adjacent. There is an ocean-front gazebo restaurant that serves breakfast & lunch (with a line forming each morning for 7:00AM breakfast!) and a full restaurant-bar at the street end that is open for lunch & dinner (see pictures). Food was quite good and prices reasonable by Hawaii standards.

Unfortunately, the rectangular box construction amplifies external noise, most annoyingly the nighttime parking lot comings & goings.

I would recommend the sunset dinner cruise and hike of the rain forest. The hike includes a pickup right in the hotel lobby. The only downside is that our bedroom was next to the parking lot and you can hear ppl coming and going and hear landscapers cutting trees.", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay on Maui\u201d", "Author": "kmward", "ReviewID": "UR10084290", "Content": "We have stayed at Napili Shores 3 out of the last 4 years for our family vacation.

Disappointed with the location. Napili is known as one of the cloudiest/wettest parts of the island and when you are travelling from Scotland in January, it's nice to have a bit of sunshine! Ate in the restaurant (Fish & Poi) on a couple of occasions. Food was to a good standard although the first time we ate there we received our main course while we were still eating the starter! Even though the guy noticed this, he just dumped them on the table and took off! We didn't have a hired car but eventually hired one for 2 days. Nearest restaurants at Napili Plaza are 15 minutes walk away and Lahaina is 15 minutes drive away. Most of the snorkelling trips/whale watching depart from other parts of the island and do not pick up from Napili which was why we hired the car. Also the trips are much cheaper booking in Lahaina than direct. The trip to Hana does pick up from the hotel and is worthwhile doing. Very knowledgeable guide who was born and bred in Maui - also very unusual as everybody else seems to be from every other part of the States. Would have preferred staying in Lahaina with plenty choices of restaurants and bars. Outrigger was a little too quiet for our liking. No atmosphere in the bar (it's tiny) and also closed on a Monday night! Would recommend for familiies and older people (lots of them). We are mid 40s (no kids) but like a bit of an atmosphere and good choice of restaurants. Saying that, we can't fault the rooms or the grounds which were immaculate. Didn't have a problem with the rooms being cleaned every 3 days. Most of these condos are privately owned therefore I imagine the owners wouldn't want interrupted daily. Just makes you more independent. One slight complaint is that when the maid did come (we had just finished our breakfast and had not done the dishes), she placed our dishes in the dishwasher and put it on for an hour! Bearing in mind there were only two of us - with two cereal bowls and two glasses, it was a tad wasteful! If you are staying at the Outrigger the staff are friendly and helpful.

The accomodation was first class, we paid a wee bit more to get an ocean front view and it was well worth it - it was amazing to watch, see and hear the waves crashing in all the time. We got a one bedroom apartment - which had a king size bed, and which had 2 single beds in the living room - plenty of room for 2 adults & 2 children.

The restaurant in the hotel was really good, as were lots of others in the vicinity. A wander round to the next bay to go swimming with the turtles is a must - rent some snokelling gear from Snorkel Bob's along the road from the hotel - the hotel reception will give you directions. It was incredible. You can go on lots of (expensive) organised trips by boat to also go snorkelling with the variety of wildlife that is around the island, however this was incredible and just off the shore, and you can stay for as long as you want. Another recommendation was to buy a CD of the road trip to Hana rather than go on a formal trip. This allowed you to spend more time where it interested you and skip quickly by the area that weren't quite as interesting for you. It really gives very good information about the area and tells you when to switch it on and off as you pass by various landmarks - we would have missed a lot of really interesting things if we did not have it as a lot is off the main road and not in sight. If you do go on this trip one bit of warning remember you are in a tropical rain forrest, with lots of mossies and other nasty biting insects if you walk in the trees - take the repellant with you if you.

Very good value for the $$. We used to live down the road in Kahana, and I would often go snorkeling in Honokeana Cove (to the left of the Outrigger) to see the green sea turtles who hang out there. On this trip I wanted my kids (ages 8 & 11) to enjoy this unique Maui experience, since they were too young to do so when we lived there. Our first morning we went down to the cove, and within 30 seconds we were in snorkel heaven. They later joked that the cove was like \"Turtle Soup.\" If you want to snorkel with turtles and see lots of marine life up close, the Napili Outrigger puts you within a few hundred yards of the best snorkel spot on Maui. Believe me, no boat trip can ever beat it (I've been on them all), so save your money for other pleasures. We paid $190/night, booked directly with Outrigger. Check-in was fast -- got our towels, key cards, and headed to our room. The upstairs units are best, as the high ceilings really help keep the place cool, plus you don't have anyone creaking around above you or walking right past your lanai. Two daybeds in the living room for our 2 kids, a seperate bedroom in the back towards the parking lot, sparse but quaint island decor, and ceiling fans (no AC). Fully-loaded kitchen with new toaster, coffeemaker, dishwasher, refrigerator, all the utensils and dishes/glasses you need, includiing BBQ stuff. All very clean. Big shower, hairdryer provided. Plan to make use of the broom in the closet as you'll be tracking in sand, and regular maid service is only every 3rd day (if you want it every day just call and it's no extra charge). I brought ear plugs as I am sensitive to noise, turned out to be a good idea due to proximity of parking lot to master bedroom. Car alarms, the bane of modern existence, would go off at night - not the hotel's fault. People in general were very considerate of the quiet hours, we found -- but if there's a baby in the next room, or you're unlucky enough to lodge next to the \"Loud Family from Hell\" (there's always one in every hotel) you're going to hear it. Definitely try Fish & Poi one night, or for lunch - it's reasonably priced, and the food is very fresh and very good. They have a daily happy hour from 4-5pm with reduced-price drinks and pupus. The Gazebo is still as good as I remember, not worth waiting in line for every morning, though. Try the Coffee Store in Napili Marketplace up the road (they have very good quiche, smoothies, and gourmet pastries). Another must-try is the Honokowai Okazuya / Deli down the lower H (lower Honoapiilani Road) in Honokowai - the Lemon Caper Mahi Mahi is fabulous.

I requested a 2nd floor room but upon arrival, the only room available was on the 1st floor. We were moved two days later. Several rooms are under construction (all furniture removed, painting, etc.) Quiet hours are from 10pm until 8am. However, we tried to have dinner one evening at the resort but several young girls decided that they wanted to sing in the courtyard. It does have a nice echo but think bad american idol. When this happened on a 2nd early evening (7pm to 9pm) I called management and they said they could only do something about this after 10pm. It was Memorial Day weekend and there were a lot of families with children. We stayed in buildings B and G. The children chased each other, climbed some small trees, played in the yard in front of other people's rooms, and knocked over a lamp post. This was all tolerated because it did not occur during quiet hours. A family of mostly adults decided 7am was the best time to have breakfast on their lanai and were very loud. Expect noise and crying babies. It is not a resort to sleep past 7am and not a romantic place to have a quiet dinner with your husband. Or perhaps we just had an unlucky week from the sound of other reviews. We did notice at 2pm it was very quiet. The rooms were clean and well stocked with the kitchen essentials; however, the pans were not non-stick. You need to buy all the basics (cooking spray, paper products, aluminum foil, seasonings, etc.) It was not as convenient as we expected. We only needed to use these items once or twice for the week. It was warm without air conditioning. We both have bad allergies and found it very difficult without AC. It would also have been nice to block the noise from outside. You can not seal your room because there is a screen next to the sliding doors that has wooden slats that you can close but does not block out the noise. If you do try to seal your room as much as possible, then you are hot and humid. It was a huge drawback for us. I think it might have been cool from 1 am to 4 am. The Gazebo closed for 3 days for repairs/cleaning. We stood in line at 7am for a 7:30am opening. There were 5 people in front of us at 7am but they were just the ones holding the spot in line for the rest of their families. By 7:30, there were 12 people in front of us. But luckily, with only 14 tables and we only needed a table for 2, we were the 2nd to last group to be seated for the 1st seating. It was a good meal but not worth the trouble and aggravation. However, the Fish and Poi restaurant was excellent. We ordered take out and it was worth it. The rooms were clean and most of the staff members friendly. Other guests were not as friendly as we find in the Caribbean. Also, there is no outdoor bar. I should have realized this before but every resort in the Caribbean has at least one bar staffed during the day and early evening. It would have been nice to have a Mai Tai to watch the sunset. We had to buy alcohol and make drinks ourselves. If you are going to Maui to visit beaches, stay in South Maui. The beaches there are long, flat, uncrowded, and the weather is warmer. A waiter at Tommy Bahama's told us that South Maui is the desert and West Maui is green and lush. It did rain most mornings in Napili. The Gazebo provides large umbrellas for guests waiting in the rain. Napili beach is OK but not the best Maui has to offer. The cove to the left of the Napili Point resort had the best snorkeling and the most turtles we saw. The Road to Hana was a good trip to see the different waterfalls. We were exhausted by the end and drove all the way around. The road is bumpy and unpaved and you cannot drive more than 10 mph for over 30 miles. So it takes a long time. A park ranger at Ohe'o Gulch told us that the driving time would be the same if we turned around and went back or kept going. We are glad that we drove all the way around because the scenery was worth the trip. We started the day at 8:30 am and it took until nearly 7pm to get back to the beginning and then another hour to get back to West Maui. For $200/night, Napili Shores was an okay place to stay. I wish I booked the Outrigger at Wailea. We liked South Maui and the rooms there have AC. It would have been worth the extra money to us but the reviews led me to believe that West Maui would have the peace and quiet that we were looking for in our Maui vacation. Maui Revealed was a necessity but I bought it after I booked Napili Shores.

We had a good time. The room was very clean and nice, the resort is just to the left of Napili Bay (as you look out towards the ocean). Food: The gazebo restaurant is nice for lunch and breakfast with a good view. The banana macadamia nut pancakes were definitely good, however from all the rave reviews I expected more. I had the same pancakes in Kihei at a little diner in a strip mall (can't remember the name) that were just as good. There is a line every morning. So if you don't feel like waiting in line, walk up the beach to the North. At the other end of the bay is another resort with a nice restaurant which is also on the beach, and not crowded. Breakfast was reasonable ($8-10 each roughly) considering it's a resort. There is also Maui Tacos and Napili Market in the Napili Plaza, which come in handy being so close by. Maui Tacos is like a Roberto's Mexican Food. They have pictures of many famous people on the walls that have visited the place, so that was cool to see. We also ate at Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina for the view (food wasn't bad either, just not a huge selection as you can guess by the name), as well as Subway (trying to stay on a budget). We ate out at Hula Grill in the Whaler's Village in Kaanapali one night. It was expensive but the view was spectacular and the food and mixed drinks (banana mac) were very good. You can see some pics of the sunset in the attached photos. Activities: We didn't do any tours, we just went to various beaches and snorkeled. Napili Bay was ok, however a couple days the waves were a little rough and it made the visibility bad for snorkling. However it most likely was like this in other beaches facing the same direction. We had the best snorkling experience in Wailea Beach. It's a public beach in between expensive resorts (the Four Seasons being one of them). Get there early or on a weekday to get a parking spot, otherwise you're out of luck. At the south end of the beach are some rocks. It looks like nothing is there. However a boat or 2 offshore from them should be your first clue. As you get out there past the rocks, there's quite a bit of coral and fish. We didn't get a chance to try Kapalua Bay (next time!). We did do the road to Hana, we went early to avoid the traffic. It worked. It's a nice ride, however bring your mosquito repellant if you want to get out and hike up around some of the waterfalls! I also got bit a couple of times sitting outside our room at the resort, which was a bummer, we couldn't really eat outside our room like we wanted to (another excuse to go eat out at the beach restaurant though ;). Once you've done the road to Hana, you don't really need to do it again. It's a long drive, and there's nothing really there! I had more fun snorkling =). Shopping: Favorite shopping was in Lahaina. Whaler's Village in Kaanapali is nice but a little expensive. Lahaina Cannery Mall is a small mall with some interesting shops, as well as a food court with greek, chinese, etc food. Flight: We took Aloha Airlines, straight flight from San Diego. It was great, no complaints. Overall: Positive experience at Outrigger, the staff were nice, I would recommend this hotel. I will probably not stay here again, only because I want to try Kaanapali this time (it was always sunny there it seemed) or Kihei, someplace closer to the great snorkling we found in Wailea.

The Outrigger Shores is only a 15 minute drive to Lahaina and walking distance to many other resorts and shops. Our unit was very clean and spacious (I highly recommend the one bedroom unit over a studio & get the 2nd floor). The one drawback we found was no air conditioning. Unfortunately, the trade winds were not blowing most of our 12 days, so it was very hot. Even with the fans at full speed & with all the windows open, it was still uncomfortable for sleeping. Having your windows open means you deal with car alarms going off, luggage being wheeled across the parking lot (the rooms back on the parking lot), talking and cat fights! We didn't get one decent night sleep the whole time. Bring your earplugs and expect to be uncomfortable sleeping! That was our only complaint. The units themselves are equipped with everything you need and the grounds are spectacular. We never had a problem getting a bbq & ate dinner on our lanai every night.

There is a beachfront restaurant, the Gazebo, which serves lunch and a restaurant in the front complex building of the resort, the Fish and Poi, which serves dinner and lunch. The Gazebo is known for its Macademia nut pancakes and there are line-ups for breakfast beginning at 7:30 am. The resort has access to the crescent shape beach around Napili Bay. The beach is clean and composed of golden sand while the bay offers calm waters due to the presence of a coral reef. The coral reef offers terrific snorkeling opportunities. I went on snorkeling trips to Molokini, Lanai and Napili Bay and found the variety and frequency of ocean and reef life greater in Napili Bay. Snorkel Bob's, a snorkel gear shop located down the road from the Napili Shores resort, rents snorkel gear on a daily or weekly basis. Daily rentals range from $ 5 - 9.00. The resort offers a daily beach towel service, a condo cleaning service every third day and has an on site laundry. There are also 5 gas barbeques where you can grill your dinner or lunch.

The location is quiet and convenient, easy to find. We enjoyed a second floor ocean view studio unit, which was equipped with a full kitchen. With a market located at the turnoff of the main road (1/4 mile from the resort) we enjoyed home cooked meals nearly every nite, saving a bundle for other activities. The kitchen WAS fully equipped with pots 'n pans, full set of dishes, glasses and coffee cups for like 6 or 8 people, all cooking utensils, can openers, and they even supplied clean kitchen towels and paper towels. A clean microwave and four burner stove/oven and a full sized fridge (with ice maker) made things so convenient. We stayed in unit 213. Our lanai had a clear view of Molokai across the channel. The sitting/viewing area to sit and watch surf (turtles and whales too!) was kept clean and had plenty of chairs. There are several barbeques at each of the two pools, which were cleaned every morning by the attentive staff (no lie, I sat and watched them do so while sipping my kona every morning!). At the lower pool you will find the Gazebo Restaurant, and surprisingly when locals asked us where we were staying, they would immediately recognize the resort as the location of the Gazebo! Great pancakes! One thing to note, unless you ask, there is maid service only every 3rd day. When we realized it though, we asked for towel service daily and they were happy to accomodate. Plumaria trees decorate the grounds, as well as other lush vegitation, all kept up daily by the gardening staff. In short, we're planning our next visit for next December, may take our kids next time.

If you are a light sleeper like me, you may want to opt for a Gardenview room instead, or at least bring your earplugs. Even the second night my wife complained about the sound and she's a heavy sleeper, but the view and the patio were worth it. Definitely a nice little place to stay, very close to everything.

They also have a nice restaurant adjacent to the lobby, but we haven't eaten there. The oceanfront Gazebo restaurant serves delicious breakfasts and lunches. Their macadamia nut pancakes are a must! The line that forms there each morning is a good indication of how good their food is. (The line moves fairly fast -- just bring a cup of coffee to sip on as you enjoy a poolside and oceanfront view.) The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. There is a giant checker-board and shuffle board. There are two pools; one in the garden area (with a jacuzzi) and one oceanfront (next to The Gazebo). There are well-kept BBQS and picnic tables near both pools. The units we've stayed in have always been neat, clean and accommodating. Both studio units and the one-bedroom units have fully equipped kitchens. There is a good-sized grocery store in the Napili Plaza only a couple of miles away. Keep in mind that the garden units' bedroom windows face out toward the two (side) parking lots, so it can be a little noisy if people are coming and going before you arise. The two oceanfront buildings are studio units, only. Building \"A\" is rated A1 with it's view of the ocean AND beautiful Napili Bay. Speaking of Napili Bay -- this is another reason we stay here time after time! It is a short walk out the side gate and down a palm-tree lined sidewalk to the beach. The crescent beach is the perfect place for just about any beach activity...whether you want to just plunk down in the sand under a palm tree, go boogie boarding or body surfing, float on an air mattress in the 'softer' waves (toward Napili Kai Beach Club), or snorkel. You may never want to leave the 'neighborhood' -- but if you do, DEFINITELY save a day or two to stay right here! Napili Shores has a rocky shorefront with gorgeous sunsets over Molokai. It is perfect for kids (of any age) to go exploring in the morning during low tide. Off to the right of this rocky shoreline is the pure white sand of Napili Bay. If you walk around to the left side, you will find Honokeana Cove, which is a wonderful little snorkeling spot. The coral heads are beautiful and the tropical fish AND sea turtles are plentiful! The only drawback is getting in and out of the bay, which can be tricky. We call Napili Shores our 'home away from home' and would go back there in a heartbeat!

The Napili Shores is no different. My wife and I just returned from a week stay there for our first anniversary, having been married on the beach up the road at Kapalua (which was WAY out of our price range). With lots of good reviews about the Napili Shores, we made our reservations. The resort is tucked away in a nice area that is very much NOT upscale, overrun or busy. It's more of a community/suburb type area that just happens to have obscure resorts all along the oceanfront. The staff was friendly (though our dealings were exclusively checking in and checking out), and we really didn't notice them throughout our day. The grounds are maintained on a daily basis, pools were Always clear and clean appearing ~ the hot tub looked cloudy once (early morning, they may have just finished putting chemicals in). Room service is every 3 days, though you can request more often if you like. I felt that the kitchen appointments were fair to good, but I'm a cook and used to a well appointed kitchen so take this with a grain of salt. As you no doubt know, there is no AC in the rooms, just 1 ceiling fan. With the windows open over the front door, in the bathroom (same wall), and the window and door open on the lanai, there is often a good breeze ~ but it gets hot in the afternoons and 2 evenings it was Very uncomfortably warm. Note that I come from a home that never had AC or even ceiling fans and I currently live in the desert ~ I'm used to heat.... but the humidity made it just a little bit unpleasant. Thankfully a dip in the pool or a quick shower was enough to get comfortable again. I felt the bed was WELL above average in our unit (228). Some people have complained about the noise that drifts in from the lanai, and to be honest, I only ever heard birds (they actually woke us up at about 5:30am every morning). Kids were only a problem when their parents weren't being Parents and allowed them to create havoc ~ this wasn't often, but certainly kept us out of the pool on several occasions. We ate at the Gazebo one morning early on, and were disappointed (lots of high remarks here had our hopes up). I've easily made similar pancakes when in a rush and just whipping them up, and far better when taking my time. We skipped Fish and Poi (the restaurant/bar) in favor of other offerings on the island that we knew were high quality. Note that the VAST MAJORITY of rooms are garden view, a few are ocean view, and a handful are ocean front (there are ZERO beach-front rooms). Make absolutely certain you know what you're renting.... I spoke with a few folks staying that were disappointed with the view. There can be a large variance in $$ between the rooms too (ocean front was twice the amount as our garden view when we booked back in February). Napili beach is rather nice, not a 'premier' beach (visit Kapulua, less than a mile up the road, to get an idea of the difference), but nice. It was never crowded when we were there, but the water is sort of choppy and rough for beginner snorkelers. Actually, as far as snorkeling is concerned, I didn't much care for Napili itself... there was a fair amount of fish, but the coral was limited. On the other hand, follow the path that leads in front of the resort (ocean side), up in front of the condos next door and visit the next cove over, and there is a lot more coral and several sea turtles (a couple of them are Quite large).

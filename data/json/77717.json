I will repeat other reviewers....funny smell in room and the carpet would have been nice when it was new!! along time ago!! Keep your shoes on! The cleaner keeps the bathrooms spotless however it must be a different cleaner for the bedrooms!! Dust is quite thick on the carpet around the edges and under the bed and tables!! bare wire for telephone lead also under bed. Thick dust clogging up aircon. Horrible marks on back of curtains and same mark inside lamps with thick dust on light bulbs. They have a stand for your case which has elastic straps across to support it however two were broken, they should just take it away it is useless!!

The Ramada Wilshire Center had no vacancies, but we drove a little bit and stumbled upon Dunes Inn. The location was great for us, relatively close to the Wiltern Theater (not walking distance though), and the mostly residential neighborhood--Hancock Park--was quiet and safe. (By safe, I mean, the only entrance is manned by a watchful clerk; there are no vagrants around; nearby are expensive condos, houses, and a few churches; and I would feel comfortable walking around the block, though the streets are quite dark.) The bed was comfortable, but not luxurious. The tv worked fine. Best of all, the bathroom must have been recently renovated, because it was impeccably clean with a nice granite countertop and new tilework. There was a refrigerator, a pool in the atrium, wifi, and a few rooms with a small kitchen, but we didn't use these and can't comment. Since we didn't pay full price, the room was a really great deal. Parking was free and greatly appreciated; since the neighborhood is not within walking distance of restaurants, night life, etc., you'd want to visit with a car. As a side note, some nearby places to visit by car: charming Larchmont Village, Koreatown, Griffith Park & Observatory, Downtown/Japantown, and LACMA. To summarize, Dunes Inn Wilshire is like a Travelodge but with a fancier, cleaner bathroom, and we'd definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luzern", "Title": "\u201cNot very good ...\u201d", "Author": "Anygisi", "ReviewID": "UR61868957", "Content": "The nightshift did Not Know Anything about our Reservation.

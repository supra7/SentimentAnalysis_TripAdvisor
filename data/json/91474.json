The rooms were a little old, but clean. They have a full kitchen with stove with an oven, microwave, (I think dishwasher, I didn't use it so I don't recall), coffee maker and a full fridge. Plates and utensils are also provided. I had a king size and there was also a fold out and a single matching chair. I had to move the desk around so that I could watch the flat screen tv. Funny thing was in the assisted shower, there is no place to put your soap or shampoo, so I had to fold up a towel on the back hand rail and place them on there. Minor issue. The only qualm I had with this facility is the parking. Since it appears to be a long stay facility, people park their trailers etc taking up much space and so they tell you to park across the street in this office park parking lot. It is not a busy street and it's not far, but it is an inconvenience. There is a Steak and Shake within walking distance and a Bob Evans maybe less than a half mile away on the other side of the freeway. Also a gas station/mini mart within walking distance.

Allison was wonderful. Angela on the night shift was outstanding as well. The only staff issue was the unfriendly, unhelpful, and downright unpleasant woman that I interacted with on the morning of my departure. The first room had an overwhelmingly strong odor of dog urine. Allison happily moved us to a different suite next door. The suite was large, comfortable, clean, well laid out. The disposal did not work overly well and failed completely late the last evening. Free in room wi-fi, 2 computers, and a printer in the lobby are a plus. My daughter and her friend utilized the pool each evening. The pool area is small, but adequate. Laundry room on site is a benefit, although the room could have been cleaner.

First, a word about going there late at night. If you're coming from the north on I-65 and you exit at 71st St, the road is dark and forested for the first bit, making it hard to see. I recommend that from southbound 65, you take 865 East to 465 South, then exit at 71st St. Second, it's easy to drive right past the hotel without seeing it. From either 65 or 465, head east on 71st and go past a McDonald's, a gas station, and a two-story red brick office building; then turn left onto the side street, go about 50 feet, and turn left into the hotel lot. The property was quite nice. The kitchenette had a small range with four burners and an actual oven. If you're heating a frozen pizza, you're set. It also had a dishwasher. Three cheers. The bed was comfy, and everything in the bathroom was fine. The only beef I had was with the placement of the TV. Because the room had a sofa-bed and matching side chair, the TV could not be seen from the bed. I like watching TV in bed and turning it off with the remote. Not being able to do that was inconvenient, but not a huge deal. The breakfast consisted of several types of cold cereal. Not my cup of tea, but better than nothing. There was one safety problem. I stayed in the south building, the one closer to 71st street. On the staircase to the east, at the top of either the second or third floor, the carpeting and rubber edging at the top step were askew, making it easy to trip. Except for the staircase problem, I thought the property was fine, and I got it for $54 including tax through Priceline, better than a room at another suite-style hotel, Extended StayAmerica in Buffalo Grove, IL, that I had gotten for the same price about a month earlier.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWould not stay here again\u201d", "Author": "olliel02", "ReviewID": "UR110723489", "Content": "Very dissapointed with this Marriott property.

It needs updating and repairs (broken lamps, damaged doors, chipping paint, etc.) BUT for $79 for one night, it was okay. The area is convenient, but noisy!

It's a really good value (especially for Marriott Reward members: only 7500 points for a free room). The rooms are bigger than typical hotel rooms, with a small kitchen. It was nice to have a fridge! Our room wasn't really so much of a suite as a big room with a kitchen, but a larger room is always nice. The bed was comfy (I like a softer bed). Unlike at least one other review, we found it to be very quiet! There were a LOT of kids this weekend, and we didn't hear a thing. The breakfast was minimal; but they had some breakfast, which was also nice. I didn't expect there to be anything at all. There is a nearby Starbucks (on the other side of the interstate) and if you go one exit north (86th st), you can find anything you are looking for. Wireless internet worked great. It can be tough to find, since it's a little off the interstate and the sign is small and in a weird location. The only negative is that it could use some freshening up - maybe not quite to a remodel level. Nothing too bad - a good cleaning and painting would make it look new again.

It wasn't a deal breaker because it wasn't something I really used. The refrigerator and everything else was great. I will say, the thing I hate with most hotels is that their pillows are too soft. You need like three of them to feel comfortable, lol. Anyway, the staff was very nice and they provide continental breakfast.

Indianapolis was our \"destination\" after 3 long days of car traveling. We are seasoned travelers and usually really enjoy staying at Marriott's. My husband called a couple of weeks in advance to make sure we would have some basics.... if the hotel didn't have them, we were going to lug them along. These included a playpen for our baby and some extra pillows for me (who was very pregnant), and making sure we would have double beds. (One for us, one for our 2 older kids). The person on the phone said that there would be no problems with our requests and we didn't need to reserve anything offically, however, my husband likes to cover all the bases. With things\"reserved\" we thought we were covered. Rolling in at 1AM we found that they had given our playpen to someone else- and in fact the two they had were being used even though we had one \"reserved\". Also it took an hour to get the extra pillows and my husband had to ask for bedding for the sofa sleeper. Not something one likes to do at 1AM after lugging up to your room. The staff was not particularly helpful or even nice. Even though we had room for 4 (a bed and a queen sofa sleeper) the service in the kitchen area was only for 3 people. The bedding had been starched to be extra scratchy, and although it claimed to have a full kitchen (table too) There was a table, but only 1 chair. We ended up having to sleep our 1 yr old on the floor which made it hard at naptimes, and they said they could only spare a couple of pillows and one blanket. This was a convenient location, however there was a Hampton Inn for the same priace down the street.

I have found on both occassions the staff to be friendly and helpful with suggestions for dinning and such. However, the management evidently is signifiantly lacking. After checking into the hotel I found the room to be very poorly cleaned. The tolet was dirty, coat hangers still haning on doors and just overall below the Marriott brand quality. I know some people compain of the section of the city the hotel is located. There are many unsavory businesses and possible inappropriate activity. However, I have found if you stay to yourself and don't go out unless you are driving or taking a taxie it is not too dangerous. The sleep qualaity of the hotel was poor, with an obviously worn mattress and form pillows. Two pillows was just too much to sleep on, but one was not enough-very uncomfortable. The rooms seems to be quiet and there is a pool and exercise room. I wanted to print my boardig pass in the bussiness center, but the computers were excessively slow. This hotel is supposed to provide a free breakfast for guest and the sign is up clearly stating that breakfast starts at 6:00 AM. However, when I went down at 7:00 AM, they were still not open. Several guest came expressed frustration, beacuse they had to leave to get to the airport, and breakfast was still not available. A man came out fromt he kitchen and announced that they were running late and he was not sure when breakfast would be available. The did finally put out some cold foods and milk. The sad part is that there are few options for hotels in this area. I think all of the hotel in this area are more of the lower brands so the selection is somewhat limited. Memphis is not really that big of a city and I think next time I am here I will just stay in one of the hotels further away.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Florida", "Title": "\u201cdirty\u201d", "Author": "Susan D", "ReviewID": "UR123808903", "Content": "I flew into memphis on business for the 1st time, thinking the courtyard was a good choice for the 1st night.

Room: My room had a parking lot view and was a little smaller than most Courtyards. Very nice bed and TV. Mini fridge, coffee, and full plug-in hairdryer (nice). There was a couch and table and a work desk. I got a strong WI-fi signal and that was free. I was in 159 and got the Medtronic rate - I mention this because I actually had to prove that I was there for them. It saved me $45 per night. Bathroom: strong shower, separate room from sink. Again a little small it fine for one person. All very clean. Gym: let's call it a room with a treadmill, elliptical, a bench and tweets of dumbbells (15 & 20). Whirpool is inside next to gym - windows to gym & business area. Pool is outside and pretty nice - closes at 11pm. Business area had about 5 computers and was open in the lobby. Breakfast: good buffet, several hot and cold voices, eggs, sausage and gravy, waffles, cereal, fruit, etc. Service there was awesome - they GET business travel and were super quick.

The hotel is located in an office park comlpex near the Memphis airport. Not a whole lot nearby in terms of retaurants, etc, so if you stay here you will need a car. Pretty muchyour standard courtyard hotel--our room had 2 queen beds (reasonably comfortable), a large flat screen tv, the standard desk, and lounge chair. The bathroom was basically clean, but there were a few small places where mildew had built up. I stepped into the shower the night we checked in, and had a lot of problems controlling the water temperature and pressure---something was wrong, and really struggled with the shower know to turn off the water. Called the front desk and asked them to send someone up to take a look--they said it would have to wait til tomorow, but asked if I wanted a new room; I stayed where I was give the late hour, and the next day when I returned in the afternoon, they had fixed hte shower--so pretty decent service---no complaints how it was handled. Upin checking in, the front desk staff was ok---professional but hardly friendly. Biggest complint was the noise--lots of noise coming frm the A/C--maybe the loudest I have heard in a hotel. In addition, there are constant flights taking off and landing at MEM (FedEX I guess) all through the night---you can most definitely heare the planes as they arrive and depart. Does not make for a soothing nights sleep. I also used the hotel's exercise facilties twice--very limited in terms of equipment--two bikes, one treadmill, and some free weights.

I love all brands of marriotts' because of their cleanliness and awesome customer service. Although this particular location wasn't on par with the rest of the other properties I've stayed at. I've been here one other time before and got a room on the interior side that faces the courtyard/pool area. That time was actually pleasant and I didn't have any noise complaints as some people have mentioned. This last time I stayed, we got a room facing the freeway which was somewhat a pain cause at night you could hear the crickets and traffic NON STOP unless the AC was on which drowned out the sound. Once in a while I'd hear the planes fly over too but it wasn't something that made the stay unbearable. On the 2nd day or so, I was going to put some water in the mini fridge when I noticed something on the floor and next thing you know, it was a dead cricket right in front of the fridge. I then proceeded to try and call the front desk but for some reason, both phones in our room weren't working for like 10-15 min. I was already upset that I found a dead bug and I didnt even want to try and look around the room to discover more surprises. Eventually the phones worked and I asked the front desk if they could have someone from housekeeping come vacuum around the room but since it was early evening, the housekeeping staff already left for the day which is understandable but she didn't even bother to say that she'd have someone come and take care of it. Her excuse as to why that dead cricket was there was \" I'm sorry mam, but it probably flew in when you opened the door\". First of all, I didn't even open the sliding door to go outside and how could it just fly in when the room entrance is inside the hotel? She eventually sent someone 10 minutes later after speaking to her but just the way she handled it was unacceptable, especially for marriotts' standard. Those are my main complaints.

Anyway, the hotel shuttle picked me up and the driver was very polite and explained how to get back to the airport in the morning via the complimentary shuttle. Memphis can be a somewhat shady area but this hotel was safely located in a professional office park. Check-in was quick and easy. The front desk woman was very professional. Although I do agree with others that the elevator location is bit bizzare. If you'd imagine the furthest point from the front desk... that's where it is. Odd.. but whatever. The rooms were very nice. The decorating in the room was very warm and inviting with nice woods/colors. The beds were very comfortable with nice linens... probably the same used with other Mariott properties. King Rooms had nice pull out couch. The bathroom was extremely clean with a sink outside the bath/toilet area. There was a nice desk for my laptop. One bad thing is there isn't wireless internet outside lobby... but it is free in-room via ethernet cord. Slept well, checked out the next morning, and then back to the airport via timely shuttle. Free coffee in the lobby in the AM as well as free computer use in lobby. Overall great staff, great room, great shuttle, great property, great price. I highly recommend.

First off arrived at 1345 hrs on a Thurs aft after flying all night , and was told to come back later as housekeeping was in a conference. For an airport hotel, inexcuseable, I suspect there had to be at least one room made up and ready in the place given housekeeping had to have been at work since early morning. If they are not cleaning the vacated rooms first they need to start doing so. Second, I had arranged to have two deliveries made just prior to my arrival, and alerted the hotel to this fact. They found one box right away, but could not find the the other, which FED EX had delivered the day before. This went on for two days until someone finally looked in another spot and found it. Third, my room was on the back of the building and the interstate one parking lot away was a little noisy, though it did quiet down somewhat at night. Get a room facing the interior court if possible. On the afternoon of the third of three night day, my key card no longer worked so I went down to the front desk to inquire what was wrong. They rebooted it, and confirmed that I was not checking out until Sun am. At 0330 hrs Sun morning someone else checked into my room while I was asleep on top of the bed( I do not wear PJs). I do not know who was more upset, me or the poor lady who walked in on me. Women travelling alone would not be impressed if a strange man walked into their room, and I as a male feel exactly the same way about nocturnal strangers of either sex entering my room unexpectedly. I suppose I should have double locked the door, and will in the future, but obviously some incompetant had punched into their computer that the room was unoccupied and thus available for the night. It took me until 0600 to get back to sleep as I was somewhat stressed.

We needed a clean hotel, near the airport, with a certain level of comfort to guarantee a good night's rest. Coming from an almost 24 hour flight, we were very tired with our 9 luggage in tow. I had tried to check our luggage from Asia all the way to Paducah, our final destination, but tighter airport security would not allow this so it meant my family of 5 plus 1 nanny had to check out our 9 luggage in Memphis and recheck them the next day for our onward flight. This trip was to visit relatives so 5 of the 9 luggage were for Christmas presents. :) We booked the Courtyard Inn located at 1780 Nonconnah Boulevard in Memphis and were very happy with the choice. First, the free roundtrip airport shuttle was a big help. The driver was in fact very accomodating and even offered to make a second trip for our luggage since they had brought the smaller van not anticipating the number of luggage we had. When we got to the hotel, the front desk staff offered to keep our luggage in their office. They explained that this is not a full service hotel so they did not have a concierge. Despite this, the staff went out of their way to make our stay very comfortable. When I asked for nearby restaurants, they provided info and even gave me a menu of several restaurants who could deliver. We could not have been more pleased learning that we could have food delivered to our hotel as we were too tired to even think of going out. The free internet was a big help as I was able to do online check in and print out our boarding passes for our flight the next day. The rooms were very clean and had everything we needed for an overnight stay. If you want to see photos, visit the marriot website and look for Courtyard Memphis Airport. The rooms and facilities are exactly as they look in the website photos. On our return trip to the airport, they used the bigger shuttle to accomodate all our luggage. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

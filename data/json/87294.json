When we first walked in the door, we couldn't even see the grass! Now that's ocean front. The sound of the waves crashing was so powerful... just amazing! It was loud at times but we found it strangely soothing as well and it sure helped to drown out any other 'noise' happening on the grounds or in other units... so it was perfect. The first morning we were there, we saw whales playing halfway between us an Molokai. Just stunning and so exciting. The ever changing surf and mood of the ocean, the way the sky looked, it was always so enticing. Papakea offers true comforts of home. With a full kitchen and washer and dryer in-suite, and the sofa was a sofa bed so it worked out well that we each had a bed to sleep in. It was SO clean and so nicely decorated.

Essentially stating the review was inaccurate, the managers response is tooled to make the problems had at the resort simply a matter of misunderstanding or worse, false claims. I too, stayed at the Papakea and I feel compelled to write a review, especially after reading the manager's responses. I would have given the resort a 3 star, however the failings of the management staff pull my overall experience down a notch. My condo was also pretty run down. No granite and stainless steel kitchen for me either. 80's formica. Nothing like the photos. NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS. We were also told the managers would be gone for 2 days and they were unreachable. In addition, were were told that if they switched us, they would have to switch a lot of other reservations of those coming in after us to accommodate. As if that is a good reason. Basically, it is luck of the draw. Don't count on getting a room change at a busy time of year. Sure, maybe they can upgrade you if there is no one else there, but not at high season, baby. Everyone we met who had a nice place there had booked through the owners. I would only go that route in the future. It is easy to walk the compound at night and see in to the other condos--we did and saw just as many nice condos as beater condos. Another safety note: we were also at the Papkea when the power went out. There were no exit signs or emergency lights lit anywhere on the property. Indeed, there are light FIXTURES in the stairs, but they do not light up when the power is out. Outdoor hallways and stairs (the only kind on the property) were so dark you could not see a hand in front of your face. If indeed the management staff is available via phone, then I would guess they have trained their staff to \"broken record\", or \"deal\" with guests with complaints until they go away. I don't think we were told the manager was unavailable for 2 days because the desk staff wanted to rankle me. I think they have a directive. Another note: I would never go to the place in the hotter months of the year. The aircon unit in our condo was a single window/wall unit in the living room, a long way from the bedroom. It was noisy and did not blow cool air. Because we were happy to have fresh ocean air, we kept the place open all hours. It never got hotter than 84 while we were there and the breezes were great. But if you are the type who needs AC all the time, you'd be really bummed to have to live with that AC solution. Pros: Nice clean pools with rules like \"no running, spitting of water, blowing of noses, no jumping in, no loud game playing, no ball throwing, no snorkeling ( yes, really--the security guy comes around regularly to enforce the rules and we found the no snorkeling a bit harsh, however germ aware)...\" Beautiful ocean is right there. Not expensive, and it would have been even cheaper had we booked with an owner directly. Super friendly cleaning staff. Cons: Out of date condo is a strong possibility for you. It was reality for us. No hope to move to better unit. Unavailable management.

We also got really tired of the security guards constantly telling the kids to not do things at the pool. According to them they are hired by the HOA to enforce the rules.

I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to people traveling Without children or families with toddlers. If you are traveling with older children beware of the rules regarding their play. The security guards are not rude, but they are relentless in their hounding of the kids at the pools. The HOA needs to be aware they are chasing families away with some of their rules.

We had a 3rd floor condo with an 'oceanview'. We paid $2900 for the flight, condo, and rental car departing from Toronto. CONDO- Was beautiful, spacious, clean and well equipped. It included laundry, dishwasher (unlimited detergent), standard size fridge and any other utensils or pots/pans you would ever need. It included a large lanai with a breakfast table and a sun chair. The main room was nicely furnished. The bedroom was great, comfortable mattress, sufficient sheets which they changed every other day. They also changed our bathroom towels daily, as well as swept the floors. The washroom included a single shower with a fantastic shower head. You will never complain about the pressure or water temperature. The soaps/shampoos were quickly replaced when low. Please note they do not include toothpaste and they only include a 1 load package of laundry detergent. After that you have to pay $1 for every additional one (which they will bring to your room) or you can purchase for 75 cents at the nearby ABC stores (walking distance). They provide each room with 4 pool towels which they launder upon request. They also replenish your Kona coffee everyday! The condo was quiet and we were never disturbed by surrounding noise. I should note they do have elevators for those who want a higher level, however, are physically unable to climb stairs. RESORT- Was almost at full capacity when we were there. Space was never an issue and the parking was convenient. The staff were pleasant and we never had any issue. The first day we had a nice orientation compliments of Expedia. I encourage you not to skip it. Free breakfast pickings and they raffle a free trip. It is not a timeshare and there is no pressure for anything. We never used the pool or hot tub but they appeared nice and many guests seemed more than satisfied as they would swim until very late at night. The resort is ocean front, however, swimming is not recommended directly out front. There is plenty of grass and sun chairs to use along the rock wall. If you want a sandy beach, walk to the resort next door and you will find a sandy beach that stretches for miles. You will also find other resort restaurants along the way. There is an easily accessible boardwalk that will take you the entire way along. The beach was great for swimming and snorkeling! Some days the waves would be plenty, other days not at all. Despite being close, this area was one of our favourites on the island. The resort was landscaped beautifully, there were never any issues of theft (in room or vehicles) and there were no bugs that we seen. We loved the location of the resort after visiting the busy and crowded South end of the island. It was convenient to travel and close to everything you wanted. Lahaina town was a favourite for dinner time, a 10 minute drive South from the resort or a cheap cab ride. Also there is no restaurant or fitness facility directly on the resort. There are fitness classes available. The restaurant meant nothing as there were plenty all around us. ISLAND- Maui wowee! We loved Maui (although the rugged Kauai still remains a favourite). There are so many things to do and travel is convenient. We traveled the entire island during our 10 days including a ferry trip to Lanai for a day. Its hard to list only a few things we loved... We watched the sunrise from the volcano summit one morning, woke up at 3am and drove up to the summit (there is a guy that sells coffee in a booth half way, it gets a bit chilly!) We were cognizant of the weather, ensuring it was going to be a clear night/morning for best view (although many of the clouds are below 10,000 ft and dont matter). We were shocked at how busy it was, park rangers assist in getting everyone parked at the top. You do pay a small park entrance fee per vehicle on your way in (cash appreciated). Bring a blanket. We also hiked after the sunrise, it was magnificent, almost like you're on another planet. Bring lots of water, food, and a comfortable jacket. Hana highway - AWESOME! We had a jeep and did the entire thing (it gets rough to the South). If you are not a skilled or patient driver, go very early in the morning or do a bus tour. We stopped many times along the way, swam in waterfalls, bought banana bread, pictures galore. It was incredible (especially if you pursue the South roads where many do not travel). The South roads loop you around the the main highways eventually. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH GAS IN YOUR VEHICLE. I'd also warn people not to get a late start or you will be stuck on the roads at night, which could be a disaster. The North part of the island was also beautiful. We would often see dolphins swimming and the beaches were nice. If we seen clouds coming in on the North we would just head South to extend our beach day. FERRY TO LANAI - The ferry trip we purchased online before we left. It was a package that included an off road jeep for the day. Budget rentals will give you a map for you to navigate the rough roads and hang out on untouched beaches. There is hardly anything on this island so do your research and be prepared for food and come with any other necessities you may want. It was a great time discovering the sights and shore line. LAHAINA TOWN - We went here every night for dinner trying a new restaurant each time. Famous Daves was our favourite! Lots of shops to walk through while you are walking off your dinner. Lastly the weather was great on Maui! and the people were nice. If you have any questions feel free to send me a message.

Overall it was OK, but ultimately I felt like I did not get what was advertised on their website. Be warned that many of the condos look NOTHING like the photos on the Aston website. Those are all deluxe corner units. The one we got didn't have as many windows and the kitchen was totally USED UP -- looked like it was last updated in the 1970s. At the advice of many other TripAdvisor reviewers, I'd asked for a \"renovated\" unit. When we checked in at the front desk, the woman said we had indeed been placed in a renovated unit. But that was clearly not the case once we finally got to our room. The next morning, I went down to the front desk and asked if we could switch to an actual renovated unit. There was a VERY rude and defensive blonde woman there who said they were sold out and there was nothing she could do -- and when I asked to speak to a manager, she said the managers were all \"in meetings\" for the next two days and that I could try checking with them on Wednesday -- already almost halfway through my vacation. This was the week before Christmas -- supposedly one of the busiest times for Hawaii -- and the managers are all \"in meetings\" and unavailable, even by phone, for two full business days???? That seems pretty ridiculous. On Christmas Eve, there was a power outage (I think much of the area was affected, not just the Papakea). However, they have NO BACKUP LIGHTS ANYWHERE. It was literally pitch black throughout the entire facility, including all the stairwells. My husband happened to be over at the main building and actually fell into some of the landscaping trying to make his way back to the condo. I can't imagine the fire marshall would be OK with the fact that there is no emergency backup lighting at all. This is a huge condo development, with several buildings, all of which are four stories. OK -- I do have some positive things to say. They have two pools, which are kind of small but totally fine. We always were able to find a chaise lounge to sit on. There are lots of families and \"regulars\" there and it had a nice community vibe about it. The condo itself was pretty clean (although the floors were all really sticky when we arrived ... we cleaned them ourselves and then it was ok). If you go to this complex, I highly recommend using vrbo instead of booking directly with Aston. If we'd done that, we could have saved a bundle of money. Also then you would be able to see photos of the exact unit you'll be in, and know whether you'd be in a totally outdated, used-up unit or not. I see the benefit of booking directly with the resort to be that if you have an issue with your room, you can switch, but since that wasn't gonna happen, I wish I would have booked directly from an owner. I could have stayed in a comparable unit if I'd booked through vrbo for about half the price I paid booking directly through Aston.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay at Papakea\u201d", "Author": "maxum2311", "ReviewID": "UR122494260", "Content": "This is my first review of Papakea, however my wife and I have stayed there 10 times over the past 3 years.

It was spotless when we checked in and in the end that is truly what really matters the most in my opinion. Maui is a beautiful place and at the end of the day it's about the island anyway.

There are pros and cons to the resort so I wondered whether to give it three or four stars. No, the beach isn't swim-worthy but a big part of coming to Maui is trying all the different beaches so we had no problem with this point. Pros: Lovely property, not crazy busy and friendly staff. The grounds crew were fantastic (what a huge job), the pools were great, the barbecue facilities great. We had no problems with bugs, and everything in our condo worked (although a very slow dryer!). Would we stay here again...definitely but I would be a bit wary about our requests - maybe speak to Dave (the hotel manager). He was the one who convinced me to book here given his upbeat and honest responses to many of the reviews of this property. Cons: I guess just two complaints. We booked in March 2011 and requested a ground-floor unit, called monthly to confirm we still had our request recorded and...got the fourth floor. The next day we requested a move and got the second floor. Our in-laws requested to be moved also from their third floor to ground level but at that point, they ended up in a different building. Oh well. Because we stayed for three weeks, we were on the extended rate which meant weekly housekeeping. Funny enough, I spoke to a couple other people who were staying as long as us but received daily housekeeping?!? Our weekly housekeeping was every 7-8 days (not weekly) and pretty basic.

The lanai was huge with the ocean right in front (since this does not have a beach directly in front, the ocean was very close). The sound of the crashing waves was amazing. Sunset from the lanai was sublime. We ended up spending a lot of time in the lanai (nice lounger and chairs in lanai). The grounds of the resort was excellent. Pools were good, which we did not end up using much. The mini golf was a nice add-in. DVD rental was a nice feature too. The beach started right next door which great.

The condo we stayed in was managed by Maui dreams, and all our contact with them was fantastic. To note; Maui dreams offered to book our rental car for us claiming that they get cars much cheaper due to a corporate discount. We found their price to actually be about $100 more for the week than if we just booked it on orbitz or the like. We did book our car through Maui dreams (they use Alamo) ad when we called Alamo they just gave us the online rate. So don't fret if you've already booked through them, just call o get te best rate. Now off that tangent, the condo was magnificent. Beautiful lanai with an ocean view. Large bedrooms. One with king bed, other with double and twin bed, and loft with queen and two twins. No central ac, only one window unit and fans. The beach was a little disappointing. I had read on here that there was no beach, when u called Maui dream I questioned about this and I was assured that there was a beach. There is not one right in front if the condos. You have to walk to either end of the hotel property, which is easy. But we pretty much did not spend any time there. We went down to kaanapali, and up to napili, all distances too far to walk. The condos pool is really nice and clean, watch out for the gate, it closes fast and bites backs of heels! The first morning they offer you a free continental breakfast, which is pretty much a trap to get you to listen to the \"local expedia expert\" tell you that you need to do all these tours that are very expensive in order to see Maui the right way. It was somewhat beneficial to see geography of the island and local beaches, but unless your question has to do with Vito hung one if his trips, Troy, was not interested in helping. Ie finding a surf lession etc. This may differ person to person, but that was our experience. We did no paid tours of the Island and had a great time. We went to Haleakala in the middle of the day, spectacular! Actually people say sunset us better than sunrise! You can't bike from the top, only from the visitors center wich is so far down anyways you miss most of the views. Back to papakea. Our condo had putters in the closet for te golf course. But you had to rent tennis rackets and shuffleboard stuff ad they were like $8 an hour. Seemed too expensive to me.

The unit was newly renovated with granite countertops and a beautiful new kitchen and bathroom. The closet was stocked with beach toys, chairs, snorkel gear to use and books to read. There was also a washer and dryer in the unit. Each evening everyone would gather in the front of the resort which is where we were for the nightly event of sunset. The sunsets were the most beautiful I have ever seen and everyone gathered with cameras and tripods to capture it. The resort is within walking distance or a short drive from a local grocery store and not far at all from the shops of Whalers Village. You would need to drive to Whalers Village. The beach is rocky in front of the Papakea and you can only go out when the tide is out but just next door at the neighboring resort there is a sandy beach that you can use. The Papakea is an older resort but is still very well maintained and very clean. It was quiet here with nice pools that were also clean. There were also grills to use and it seemed like a friendly neighborhood community in the evenings with everyone out grilling or playing mini golf on their small area. Some people even own their condos and live there year round. While staying at the Papakea we drove down to the Sheraton and snorkeled off the beach at Black Rock. This was the best free snorkeling!

He ruined quite a few moments while we were sitting on the lanai. Also couldn't sleep with the sliding door open because the smell of smoke filled our room when he went for his evening smoke. We told the front desk several times, even doing some investigative work ourselves to find out who was smoking. The front desk said they would send security, but the problem persisted. Only until we checked out did they admit that it was probably an owner who was smoking and they can't do anything about it. To put this into perspective, when we arrived at the resort just after midnight, one of the things the security guard felt it necessary to tell us whas the absolute no-smoking policy on the resort.

Check-in was fairly easy although we did have to wait until slightly after 3pm to be able to get into our room. The unit we stayed in had a newly renovated bathroom and kitchen which were very nicely done. The things which could have used updating were the carpet, bedroom decor and A/C to make it superb, but overall we enjoyed our stay. The single A/C unit in the living room would struggle to cool the bedroom, but we made do as there was ceiling fan and floor fan available, plus it's not like it gets really hot, but someone who likes their room freezing might complain. There was an Flat panel TV in the living room and bedroom. Housekeeping is available everyday if needed. The grounds are very nice, with two pools. Although we were told only one (Lanai) was heated, both pools were comfortable and were well used by the guests but never too crowded. If you are here to lie on the beach at your resort this is not place for you as of now. Due to numerous factors (tsunami and extra high tides due to moon being closer to Earth this year), the beach completely disappears at high tide. You can walk down to your left on the beach across the little bridge to the beach at the Aston Kaanapali Shores. We were fine using lounge chairs on the grass above the beach. A previous reviewer said something about it being a sewer drainage point being right beside the hotel, but it appears actually be a stream bed that is only active when heavy rain water flows down from the West Maui mountains from the Honokowai reservoir. We snorkeled right out of the hotel in clear water - saw many fish even a couple of turtles. There are BBQ grills available near the pool for those who want to grill out. The location is pretty good although as one reviewer noted this is really in Honokowai rather than in Kaanapali. There is a shopping center right across the road with several restaurants and a large grocery store. It is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Lahaina. The free high speed internet worked fairly well with many connections available, but strength could be better, and at peak usage times it could be pretty slow. Full kitchen allowed us to cook several meals here rather than always eating out which can be expensive in Hawaii. If you stay in the units (x01 or x08) at the end of the building you will get extra light in the until as you will have side window. From the outside it's hard to tell which units are Aston vs. personal units but most looked pretty good. All in we really enjoyed our stay. This is probably the our preferred Aston resort of the ones we saw on Maui - quieter and less crowded than Kaanapali Shores, the Whaler or Mahana (which were all nice), with a better location and more up to date than some of the others we saw (Banyan, Lu and Kaanapali Villas). All in all I would say this definitely met our needs while in Maui. We checked out many beaches (Old Airport has nice park and Kaanapali Bay is nice but can get crowded), did the Haleakala sunrise (a must but not sure would do bike ride again). road to Hana, Trilogy Molokini snorkel trip (very good), Surfing Goat Dairy (yummy) plus much more.

The one and only downfall of this resort not condo but resort is that you have to walk at least 10-20 mins to get to a nice stretch of beach. I mean the beach is right there but you still have to walk a little to avoid the rocks and make it to a better part of the beach. Just something to think about if you are into staying at the beach all day long. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it though. The owner of this condo was friendly and very accommodating and reasonable as well.

The unit (D 401) that we rented was privately owned. We did not plan ahead too much, so getting a sort-of-2 br unit for the price we paid (225/ni incl tax and cleaning) was very difficult. Price quote from Papakea directly was much higher, but the unit was probably nicer. The rental company was easy to deal with, but Misty was not entirely honest. When I asked if the resort is on a sandy swim beach, the answer was that it's on the end of Kaanapali Beach. Well, Kaanapali beach gets smaller and smaller until the ocean comes right up to the sea wall, right at Papakea (which ironically means 'white sands'). There is also a storm drain outlet right next to Papakea, so swimming in the ocean there was not appealing. You can walk to Kaanapali, but it takes about 15 minutes before you get to a quality beach that is wide enough. She also said that you can walk the entire length of Kaanapali beach (2 mi) on a paved trail. Not true. You have some beach, some sea walls, some paved paths and some trespassing. The grounds at Papakea are very nice and clean. Beautifully manicured gardens, pretty plants, koi ponds (beware the sound of frogs at night if this bothers you), shuffleboard, putting, 2 pools with hot tubs and grills. The pools are COLD, even the \"heated\" pool was too cold for us to dip in. The staff is adequate but not overly friendly or helpful. Don't bother showing up a second before 4pm if you rent from Maui Dreams Come True. They will not lt you in early even if the condo is ready (per the rental co's rules). People staying there were retirees and families, so it was quiet at night. It was REALLY windy when we were there, and seemed to be windier at Papakea than other areas on that part of Maui. The gusting palms made for really poor sleep. The buildings are made of concrete, so you don't hear the people next door. The location of Papakea in my opinion was bad. Everything says it's on Kaanapali, but it's really Honokowai. It depends on what you want. I wanted to be on a swim beach, so Napili would have been the best with a toddler. There is a grocery store across the street from Papakea, some stores, and a beach park a 5 min walk away that is protected for small children with an ok playground. Don't bother with the \"Farmer's Market\" it's just stuff from the grocery store put on tables in the parking lot. If you want to go to a bar, there's one at the resort next door (I wouldn't stay there either - the place was so crowded, the pool looked like people soup). The unit was almost adequate. Washer/dryer was convenient. There is a window AC unit that we didn't use that's blocked by the entertainment stand. The place is really tired and needs a fresh coat of paint and new furniture. The bed in the loft is horrible. The bathroom needs to be gutted. The kitchen was supplied with the bare minimum. Not enough pots and pans to cook a meal for 4 adults and poor supply of utensils, servingware and bowls. No baggies, foil, tupperware, etc. Only enough detergent, paper towels and TP to start off with. No blowdryer. Enough towels for 4 people only (unit can sleep 7 which I do not recommend).

Our stay was from Dec 11-20 and we were then heading to Honolulu/Waikiki and then Kauai (staying at the Outrigger Kiahuna Plantation - See my other review on this). Now that I have something to compare this condo with to another one in Hawaii, this condo by far was MUCH better in terms of the feel and atmosphere of living accommodations, especially because I was travelling with a 10-month old baby. CAVEAT...each unit and what they provide will differ as these are individually owned. So my review can only speak to this specific unit. To fully see the island, must rent a car. We rented through dollar and I kept checking every few weeks for the best price. I just kept rebooking every few weeks and eventually the rate went down over $100 from when I initially booked. GOOD THINGS: - location location location: walking distance to a park for kids, farmer's market, grocery store (ABC Store, Times Grocery), take-out food (DO TRY THE L&L HAWAIIAN BBQ!). - 5-minute drive to the Safeway grocery store and small mall. Across the street from Safeway is a small strip mall with about 20 stores (Boarders, Foot Locker). There are free hula shows on certain nights. - free WiFi (although it runs very very slow - putting green (which was fantastic for baby to crawl on the soft grass) - gas bbq's (we used them 3 times) - the grounds are in excellent condition and well-kept, koi ponds clean. UNIT SPECIFIC - we were on the ground floor very close to the pool and ocean. With a baby (and stroller), it was key to be on the ground floor. It was nice to just walk out on our lanai (porch) and head to the pool or beach from the lanai - pack n' play available in the unit (I don't think all units have this and you may have to pay to rent one or just buy one at the store). - the kitchen was fully stocked (unlike at the Outrigger). You truly feel at home with the appliances and kitchen utensils. Sandwich bags, foil, salt/pepper/spices, coffee filters etc...all provided - keyless entry (punch in a code affixed to the door) ONLY COMPLAINTS: - front desk only available until 11pm. Although we didn't have any problems, we were informed that we had to check in to get a parking pass and we arrived after 11pm. Not a big issue - parking was hard to find in our building area (\"K\") if you arrived late in the evening (but we were there in high season so we understood. THINGS TO DO/SEE: - Drove to Kapalua (DT Fleming Park), we watched the surfers and checked out the golf courses (apparently you can go on a free tour of the course) - Baby Beach (off of Front Street, very calm waters for babies/kids) and Big Beach (gorgeous - waves are rough) - Molokini Tour - we saw whales, sea turtles and a rare monk seal along the way! - Drove to Keihi and Wailea and checked out their beaches, shopped at the malls (Shops at Wailea) and walked along the grounds of the Marriott and Grand Wailea - If you go to Whalers Village, if you spend $15 then your parking in the parking garage is free", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGet the oceanfront room!

We had booked and one bedroom ocean front room with a King bed. We headed over to our room in building A unit 307, the view was wonderful and that was pretty much it. The unit was very small, and the kitchen and bathroom had been renovated. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly sure when the cleaning crew had last been to our room as the kitchen needed to be wiped down and surfaces certainly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind cleaning but not the day I arrive, before I can put our things away. The bathroom was very small but thankfully it was clean. The king bed that we thought we would be sleeping in was really a full. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how it can be booked as a king and we get a full. Realizing that the unit might be a bit small for our family I called down to the front desk to check availability on a larger 2 bedroom unit and was informed the property was completely booked. While on the phone my oldest son starts to open the pullout bed. When you hear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mom can you come here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you know something is up! Yes it was, in the middle of the bed were brown droppings. I put said droppings in a tissue and on our way out to meet friends and have dinner stop by front desk. I must have been tired because the gal at the front desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even seem fazed, she was apologetic but not shocked or surprised. She immediately called housekeeping to change the linens and we headed out to dinner. After picking up a few things in Lahaina for breakfast we get settled for the night. As my kids are getting ready for bed I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reading through the information the front desk gave us and come across a pamphlet about the feral cats on the property\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I should have clued in at that point we might have mice or rats but tired I put it out of my mind and went to bed. As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m falling asleep my husband comes in and says there are more droppings in the carpet around where pull out is. I mumble I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll look again in the morning and try and get some rest. Upon waking I head into the kitchen to make some coffee and investigate around the pull out bed. I look on top of the fridge and some pull apart bread we had bought at Foodland for breakfast had been nibbled. At first I thought one of my family members may have tried it. Nope no one had touched it since I put it on the fridge\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.after some investigating behind around the pullout I look behind and the first picture is what we found. No denying that there were mice or rats running around in our room during the night! My husband immediately got on the phone with the front desk and Expedia. As we were packing up and leaving we see the notices on the door about the routine pest spraying in the units. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really go on vacation so that I can have my family subjected to pesticides! We were supposed to stay at the Papakea resort for 8 nights and instead headed over to the Westin Villas. The only real positive that I can say about the property other than the view is that George at the front desk was very helpful. Called to make sure that we were able to find another place to stay and helpful in getting a refund through Expedia. After looking at the negative review on trip advisor and seeing another guest with a mousetrap in the room I was more surprised by the indignation of the General Manager who said this in November; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The statements regarding a mouse are absurd we have not had a report of a mouse or rat since I have been here three years. We maintain a constant pest control spraying program with a licensed pest control company. We have one ferral cat per acre, 11 total and there are no mice anywhere to be found. That is an insult to the entire property.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I think they may need a few more cats, and certainly around building A and let guests know that when you plan your quarterly pest control spraying so they could make other arrangements if they are bothered by such things!", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Temecula, CA", "Title": "\u201cNeeds an Update - Highly Overpriced\u201d", "Author": "Meadowlark1959", "ReviewID": "UR90490749", "Content": "The units in this complex are individually owned, but managed by Aston.

The units themsevlves had excellent views (F Building) and exceptional beach access - literally walk across the 50 or so feet of lawn and there was the ocean. However, both of our units were in desparate need of a complete overhaul and update, including the furniture (think 1980's pastel pinks and greens). The walls were disgustingly dirtly, there was evidence of extreme, but poor patching jobs in the door jams, walls, etc. The kitchens were dated, but well appointed with necessary equipment for cooking light meals for families, and of course, the necessary washer and dryer. I would suggest this resort for families with young kids (they are everywhere!) as the kids could not do much damage to the already dilapidated condition of the units. Also, be aware that some of the units have air conditioning and some do not. This is not a problem during the day, however, when you close up the units at night for sleeping, the musty, stagnant smell of the unit is very irritating and makes a comfortable sleep nearly impossible. Our unit owner placed an irrtating fan (airplane engine noise) in the bedroom and a barely functioning ceiling fan - no help there. The bathrooms contained a single person 3x3 shower stall and one bangs his/her arms on the walls when one attempts to wash hair or body. Very uncomfortable for those who exceed 5'9 feet in height. The bedrooms are in the rear of the unit along the pathway that unites each of the units. The noise from passersby is extremely irritating. Due to the type of windows (slated glass panes) - there is no solution for this problem.

We had read the staff at the check-in desk was not particularly friendly or helpful to those renting condos from private owners, but we did not find that to be true. They were kind and helpful. There were a few things that could use an ungrade or minor repairs, but this unit was perfect. It was a joy to sit on the lanai in the morning, drink coffee, and watch the ocean and the kids in the pool at the same time. Everything we needed was in this very clean condo, it had its own keyless entry, the A/C worked wonderfully, and the beds were super comfortable. The grounds at the Papkea are kept superbly and it was only a short two minute walk to the beach. Eveything you need is within a short distance from the condo such as: ABC or ITimes store on the main road, snorkel rental next to ABC, farmers market, and a short drive north to Napili for most excellent snorkeling with turtles). If you want to venture a little farther, it was only a tad bit further drive to Lahaina were you could do all the touristy stuff and find do better prices for groceries at Safeway at the Old Cannery Mall. My only suggestion about the grounds is: if you want to use the barbeque be sure to get one early. They fill up fast so plan ahead if want to get one at dinnertime.

I have not been here since 10 years ago, I really loved it then. My husband and I came here on our honeymoon, our family has a timeshare with VI. I have to say I was a little underwhelmed after coming back here, since visiting Pono Kai in Kauai which is similar but bigger and nicer. We had a first floor garden suite in the D building, it was easy to get in and out of, but the walls are pretty thin and it's very noisy with people checking in and out all hours even 11 pm and later. The bedroom is right beside the main walkway that goes to the main office. I wouldn't want to be in this building on the main floor again. We came in July which in case you did not know is fruit fly season all summer. So the entire main floors and our hotel room was swarming with fruit flies before we even checked our stuff in. There were dead flies all over the floors and clinging to the windows. I complained at the front desk and was told they couldn't do anything about it. About 4 or 5 days into our stay someone came to spray while we were gone and magically the fruit flies had dissappeared. I do not know if this was because we complained or was standard. The flies blow in from the pineapple plantation and are all over Kaanapali Beach, all the hotels have this problem it seems in the summer. The hotel had pretty much everything we needed, except for a bathtub. I forgot how much I HATED these tiny showers. Every VI place seems to have a bathtub so this really kills the overall appeal to Papakea. The bathrooms are pretty small. The bedroom had a really comfortable bed and really good pillows. Better than other places we stayed for similar rooms, so this was nice since there were a few let downs in other areas. The washer and dryer were pretty old as well, not as good as we were expecting. The grounds are very pretty, you have shuffleboard or mini put available, but the grounds are rather small. There is a nice sized pool and hot tub which is larger than most of the surrounding hotels. There are about 5 barbecues available at the pool area. There is no sauna or gym which was disappointing since other VI resorts have this as well. Every other one seemed to have a sauna. The beach is really non existent here you have to walk down to the other hotels to walk along the beach and enjoy it. We found the guests to be pretty noisy here. For 2 nights there was a couple screaming like we were in a trailer park, threatening eachother, shreaking like the women was being chased or abused. She was shouting so everyone could be a witness. This went on for a good while, maybe up to an hour. Finally security found them and got them to shut up, but the next night they were screaming again. The buildings are all really close together so I'm sure everyone had heard this. I think next time we will want an ocean view because the islands of Lanai and Molokai are very beautiful to look at. We were not bothered by the activity desk at all, which was nice, a previous VI resort had a huge problem with this. On a plus this was the ONLY VI resort in Hawaii that we had free wireless internet. It was not that fast, but it was free. Other places we paid $7 to $10 a day, for our 10 day stays. I would also hope that this place gets a reno and some updating because the lighting is very very dim and poor and the place looks much better on the outside than the inside.

Everything about the place makes it worth it, Whales almost every morning were seen, Rainbows -double rainbows, were often showing up to greet and say goodbye. The STAFF is One of the Best I have ever seen, One thing I would like to set staright when booking this property, The Condo's are individually owned and rooms just cannot be changed once booked. Know what you are getting- ocean front is ocean front here with patio's to walk out onto. The condos' have everything you need from internet to washers dryers, pots pans, ect. One of the best things is being able to walk to everything so close-right behind the rsort is ABC stores like walgreens, dvd's, surf needs, farmers market for fresh food- fish market for fresh fish daily, Java jazz for entertainment nightly, and Great FOOD,,,so no drinking and driving, Just wlak to whatever you need... Front street not to far of a drive say 5 mins,,,,I was highly impressed with my oceanview room and location of this propetrty and would come back again and again, It has two ppols, you can walk to a bigger beach very easy. The sunset melts into the water and oceanview rooms are really worth it-even partial- just see it, It had all the comforts og home, I am a travel agent for 20 years and I watch for everything. Feel free to contact me for an upgrade and pleasant surprise in your room upon arrival. I LOVED IT !!! Take advantage of the expedia breakfast- you will get good prices and information from the reps and best seating for events, They buy blocked space and know alot about the island.

Key points: 1) if we were basing this review off of our first room (J305) then every rating would have been terrible. Everything in the room was original 1983, including the carpets which were truly filthy. There were dead bugs in the sunshine ceiling over a very dingy kitchen, grime all over the floor, dirty hand prints on the dishwasher...to name a few. After traveling for close to 10 hours with small children, arriving at such a place almost made me cry. The ocean view was also non-existent unless you stood on one corner of the balcony. 2) The next morning the staff at Papakea assured us that they had a nicer room for us that we would be moved into by 2 pm. We packed up our luggage and went for a really nice breakfast next door before heading out to Lahaina for the morning. When we returned to the hotel we were given room K205 which was in fact, beautiful. There was tile throughout the main areas, a lovely kitchen and updated bathrooms. I could even see the waves crashing on the beach from the kitchen area. 3) As many people have noted, the grounds are beautiful and the staff friendly. They had an Easter egg hunt Easter morning which I thought was nice. I really struggle as to whether I can recommend this hotel to a friend. I find that traveling with small children can be stressful enough without worrying about what sort of room you're going to end up in.

No where on their site they list as this is privetly owne condominium, so all rooms are completely diffrent. and it basically a luck of draw to what you get, regarlesss of how much you paid. but lesson learned. I should have come to trip advisor before i booked. My fault. and i accept that. with that in mind, here are the pros and cons of this hotel. PROS + amazing view of North Kanapali Shore (but only from OCEAN FRONT balcony. any other room do get blocked + location, near by restaurants and easy access to highway. + neat and clean grounds CONS + No way of knowing what you will get + They dont look at your reservation details (Since we were travelling with 15 months old daughter who loves to run and be chased, we asked for room that is not on the ground floor - we asked specifically anywhere but ground floor. - they gave us F103 - Absolutley on ground floor - I told front desk to move me, and she gave me A305, if it were available, why in first place they would stick you in to ground floor? + PARKING is a huge problem. there are no assigned parking - so everybody parks near the entrance to the beach, regardless if you are staying in that building or not. you can never get parking near your building. + We asked for CRIB. When we got in to the room. No CRIB. we called and asked. Front Desk said they will send it out. 1.5 hrs later (seriously, 1.5 hrs ) we called again, and they said they will send it out. another 1/2 hour later called again. and they said they were on their way. 20 minutes later maintannce person (Vincent - nice and polite guy actually ) shows up with pack n play. its dirty but in functional state, fine. we are okay with it, untill we found there is no mattress. so i asked the guy to get a mattress. finally we got a mattress. and sheet. the point i am trying to make is it is always a hassle with front desk. +SERVICE (Specifically Maid Service) Does not exists. I was told there is daily maid service when i checked in. later i found out that there is actually no maid serivice. all they do is replace towels and make bed. they dont clean floor, (our floor were not carpeted) +ROOM itself : Our room was not updated. it means it still had 1970 decor. to be fair, i must said it had all the stuff we needed but not in best condition. dishwasher was loud and inaffective, washer and dryer were also very loud. if you have young children you know it matters. furniture was uncofortable and outdated. bedsheet had odor and bed was not really confortable. AC was behind the 23 inch box tv. the best part of the room was the view. (we saw raibow, whales,and sunset right out of the balcony, i will surely add pictures later) +Bathroom. - Bathroom was clean but no tub. also cold water from shower. We could not get hot water. if you turn all the way to \"HOT\" side you get luke warm water. We had to grab water from the sink in beach toys to give bath for our daughter. radicoulous. front desk could not help. + Concierge/Activity Desk. - I tried get information about places to visit, best times, weather, stroller access etc. but in turn they keep getting me to buy activities. and never gave me those information, and handed me the map. they are not really concierge or not intrested in helping you plan out your day, or tip for the first timers they are only there to sell you an activities. that's pretty much sums it all up. - When i asked about Haleakala national park upon chekcking in, the concierge (Didnt get his name,) scared me about rain and sky and aske me rather join them in to free breakfast where they \"inform\" you about maui and places of intrest --- turn out to be all the activities you can purchase. so in summary dont trust them. last day room did not get either cleaned or towel service. we called and called and called 3 times and then they sent towels. In summary, I would not stay here again, the biggest thing that bugs me is all rooms are completely diffrent, although you paying the same or more, you have no say in it. they way the advertized is \"each rooms have unique decor\" i think that is completely mis-representation. If my room have shower but no tub, non-carpet floors, outdated furniture, broken dishwasher, old tv, AC Behind the TV, no hot water in shower - but room next to me have been updatd recently and do not have all these issues, how is that fair? to me, worst thing about papakea is there is no minimum standard of the room.so basically you should nto expect anything if you choose to stay here. If it was just me and my wife and this was absolutey cheapter then any other place on same area. Yes go ahead, and draw your luck. you may actually get updated room. and then dont have any expectation from maid service, front desk, concierge, parking, and dont believe them in any of their litreature and you will be perfectly fine. Front desk do not care, as it is ultimately owners' problem. Owners don't care as they never have any interaction with their guest. and agencies like costco do not care as they are just the middleman. it is amazing as actually no one is responsible for anything except you becuase you selected them. This is really really up to your luck. Either you paid really great price, or you got lucky. i am sure i am forgetting something, but i think this is enough info for you to make decision.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joseph, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPapakea D308 is great!\u201d", "Author": "bellasadierubie", "ReviewID": "UR59824127", "Content": "My husband and stayed in this condo from March 7 - 14, 2010.

All one bedroom units are 450 sq ft which is very small and none have bath tubs, only showers and queen size beds. The only air conditioning the units have is a window unit near the slider and depending on the layout of your unit this may be behind the TV. We are in our 50's and we are almost the youngest folks here. No kids and no activities at all. It is very quite. I am not complaining but some would not like the atmosphere. 2 pools, both very small and when everyone wants to go to the pool they become crowded early in the day. Housekeeping has left pillows on our bed without pillowcases on them. It is windy today with lights blinking. We just realized that our unit has no flashlights or candles.

The resort is located about 10 mins north of Lahaina and is situated close to a grocery store, some restaurants and shopping which is ideal when you are staying in a condo. The positives about the Aston Papakea first... the grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The pools and pool areas are well managed and cleaned every morning. The BBQ stations are very handy to use and easily accessable. We didn't get housekeeping every day but they did come around to see if we needed more towels or toliet paper every second day or so. We stayed here with extended family and we had a one bedroom unit on the 2nd floor (Bldg J, 202) and we had a fabulous view of the pool and the ocean. The kitchen was recently renovated and was great, the living room was all tiled and clean. We had a small icky TV for the first 2 days, then on the 3rd day a brand new flat screen showed up. The bedroom was small but okay, however the bed needs to be changed out. We hate sleeping on a mattress where you roll into the middle of it all the time. The rest of our family had booked a 2 bedroom unit since they have 3 teenagers (5 total), but the Aston Papakea screwed up the reservation and had them in a 1 bedroom. The resort was fully booked so they couldn't move them. The resort did absolutely nothing to accommodate them even though they admitted it was their mistake. They could have at least offered a discount, or free meals or excursions. Imagine 5 people living in a small 1 bedroom unit for a whole week. Plus their fridge broke down and they had to bring in a 2nd fridge for a few days until the other one was repaired. Not a nice way to spend a week of holidays. For this reason we would probably not go back to the Aston Papakea. Other resorts would have done something and we knew there were still some 2 bedroom units available throughout the week. The other problem is the lack of beach. There is none, even when the tide is out. You have to walk a bit to get to a nice one. The ocean is rough in front of the resort and down the beach. Be very careful when swimming or snorkelling, while we were there 3 people had drown. Never turn your back on the ocean. Overall, our trip to Maui was fantastic and our stay was okay.

The condos have one window AC unit. I would anticipate it not being able to cool the whole condo well at all, especially the back room. The windows in the rooms don't seal up well so they let what cool air does reach the bedrooms out and let lots of noise in. If you do stay here, make sure you're room is not near the elevator because you will hear everything! Also request a room that doesn't have the bedrooms facing the road as you will hear road noise. This resort is full of families, so if you don't want to listen to screaming kids dive bombing into the pools you might want to go elsewhere.

We stepped out to the patio the first morning and saw a stunning view of Molokai, and humpback whales breaching right off the coast. My kids, 12 and 8, loved Papakea. The beach in front is below a sea wall and is a very small strip of sand. However, because of the row of rocks/coral off the beach a few yards, it was a great place for them to swim. They still had the wave action, but it was buffered by the coral further out. They also had a great time snorkeling along the calmer side of the coral/rocks. The pools are unheated, but the hot tubs are perfect after a swim in the ocean. It is a quiet complex, with quite a few older people, who did not seem to mind my children being around. Our unit was not updated, which was okay with me, since I really like being close to the water more so than updated countertops. But many of the units can be rented directly from owners, and these units tend to be updated. Papakea is close to Kaanapali and Lahaina. It also borders a really great sandy beach, if you want to walk just a few minutes down toward Kaanapali.

It was perfect on the first floor. We would just walk out to the lounge chairs everyday or go for a walk along the beaches. This was our first time with a condo and it was a great experience. We ate breakfast every day on the patio & watched the sunrise. At night we'd open the windows to hear the beach waves crashing. I think I'm still on Island time lol! Yes, there is a seawall in front of the property, which wasn't a problem at all. If we wanted the sandy beaches, we only had to walk to the properties next door. We were informed that any beach in Hawaii is open to the public, the hotels do block off or limit anyone to be on them. We had a breakfast orientation with Expedia, and Chip was very helpful with our bookings. I definitely recommend the zipline with Piiholo Zipline. It was our first time & the guys were great!! Our room had full accommodations and plenty of closet storage for our luggage. I bought a bag of Kona coffee & realized the next morning I had mistakenly gotten the whole bean instead of grounds. Thank gosh our room had a coffee grinder, what a relief for a coffee lover! Anything I came across, we found in the room. The staff was very friendly as well. ABC store is within walking distance & we made plenty of trips. There are markets in the area, but I recommend Safeway for the best prices. Ask the cashier for the rewards card if you don't have one, they'll give you an app on the spot & you'll save alot more. Downtown Lahaina is about 10 minutes away. It's great for some nightlife & late night shopping. You can park behind the Maui Theatre shopping center for $4 for the entire night. Don't get stuck paying a high rate per hour. Plus, most restaurants will validate, giving you a 2hr time span. Overall, we paid a great price for our stay and I'm extremely happy we decided to stay here.

Again, my wife was in the dark on this trip and had no idea what to expect. When we walked into our room (1 bedroom oceanfront), her jaw dropped. It was well appointed and beautifully decorated with an oceanfront lanai. She looked at me and said \"it's perfect\" (coming from my lovely bride, that means a lot). The whole property from the grounds to the pool is immaculate. The thing that impressed us the most was the serenity. Granted, we were there during the off season, but it was peaceful. We never heard the people in the pool or heard music blaring - it was serene. The staff was always courteous and helpful with a smile on their faces. All of the rooms have a kitchen, so we stopped at the Costco outside of the Kahului airport to stock up on our adult beverages and food. We only left the resort to snorkel (check out airport beach in Ka'anapali a 15 minute walk or 4 minute drive). The Boss Frogs just down the street was a good place to rent snorkel gear and get tips on where the snorkeling hotspots are.

All I can say is wow, I wish I had done this years ago! We stayed in a beautiful 3 bedroom unit, K404, that was exactly as pictured on VRBO and the owner's web site. The condo was completely remodeled, with a great kitchen and 2 bathrooms. It has an awesome view and we enjoyed many of our meals outside on the lanai looking at the ocean and, after the sun went down, enjoying the glow of the tiki torches around the pool. We saved a lot of money by cooking many of our own meals, which was easy because the condo's kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need and there is a Star market right across the street. Most nights, we picked up meat or fish and threw it on one of the poolside barbecue grills. The younger members of our group thoroughly enjoyed Papakea's pools, shuffleboard and tennis courts and putting greens, when they weren't down at the beach. The beach directly in front of Papakea is somewhat narrow (great for little kids), but there is a wonderful boogie-boarding beach right next door and snorkeling just a little farther down, about a 5 minute walk. The adults enjoyed just lounging on the beachfront lawn, reading and enjoying the view. If you're there between November and April, make sure to bring some binoculars and watch the whales in the channel between Maui and Molokai! At the end of the day, we retired to the condo, played games and watched TV. There is a TV in every room and a couple of DVD players, so everyone was happy. And when we were ready for bed, we hopped into some of the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced in a vacation rental.

The pictures of the condo looked great and after a quick email exchange with Janet Brashen, the owner, we decided to rent direct with her. Janet was very easy to work with, all the rental information was very timely, and the per night cost was reasonable for oceanfront. The condo must have been recently renovated with granite countertops in the kitchen and downstairs bathrooms and an all-tile floor. It also had an airconditioning unit in the living area and the master bedroom, which was a nice addition. There were a total of three bedrooms. The master bedroom was gorgeous. It had a king-size four poster bed, expansive views of the ocean and its own en-suite bathroom with double sinks/shower. The downstairs bedroom had a double bed and access to the hallway bathroom. The upstairs loft had two twin beds and its own bathroom. Having three bathrooms was a nice feature with six people. The living room, dining and kitchen area was nicely furnished and very comfortable. The best part of the condo was the oceanfront lanai with doors that opened almost to the width of the living room. We had great dinners out on the lanai, and spent every morning gazing at Molokai and the ocean. My sisters and I concluded that the reason it was such an appealing view was because of the way the palm trees and Molokai framed the ocean. We loved the resort amenities as well as the condo. We took advantage of the grills that rimmed the perimeter of the pools and grilled several dinners at the condo. We also played putt-putt every night while getting the food ready. The adults' favorite activity was to take a glass of wine out, lounge in a beach chair on grass strip fronting the ocean and watch the sun set. We have some beautiful pictures from those evenings. Our boys loved the pool and the hot tub. The other great thing about Papakea was that it was convenient to a couple of small restaurants, grocery store, ABC store, wellness center for massages and snorkel rental. So here's some tips if you decide to stay on Maui and/or at Papakea: 1. Stock up on food stuffs and alcohol at Costco - it's very close to the airport. 2. Da Kitchen in Kahului is a great restaurant with excellent food. We had lunch there after shopping at Costco and ate the leftovers for dinner. We found out about it from the Costco ladies. We were quite bummed to find out it was not open on Sunday when coming back from our Hana Highway jaunt. 3. Annie's is a little hole in the wall snorkel place in front of Papakea that had good snorkel gear at reasonable prices. Check with the Expedia tour booking guide at Papakea to get a discount coupon. 4. Okayazuya & Deli is a great place to get excellent takeout and their salmon and mahimahi dinners were superb. 5. Paragon Sailing Charters was a fun time. We did a Molokini snorkel cruise with them and really enjoyed sailing on the catamaran on the way back. 6. The Old Lahaina Luau is worth going to if you have never been to a luau, but I think if you been to one, once is enough. 7. Haleakala crater hiking is challenging but fun. We are still laughing about how insane we were to hike Haleakala and drive Hana Highway (only 14 miles of it) in the same day. 8. We had great fun snorkeling around the buoys that are about 100 feet south of the condo. I even saw a moray eel (quite scary looking!) 9. West Maui Wellness Center was convenient to Papakea and offered a nice lomi-lomi massage. 10. Surf lessons at Goofy Foot Surf School were ok, but if you want to ride a lot of waves, it would pay to hire a private instructor. 11, The ABC store in front of Papakea had the best souvenirs and t-shirts for reasonable prices - we went there almost everyday for something. Maui was my favorite island of the three that we visited in Hawaii (Oahu and Kauai being the other two). I think a large part of the reason was the great condo.

One of the great things about the Papakea is that is is at the end of the north Kaanapli beach, so you don't have all the distractions from your view, but the desired amenities of restaurants and beach are literally next door with Kaanapali Shores and Kaanapali Beach Club. Even the Whalers Village and Lahaina itself are easy drives. We rented from an individual and the unit was very updated.

I had read reviews on this site and knew to look for a recently remodeled unit and this one was gorgeous. Everything was in pristine shape and beautifully appointed, and most importantly to me....perfectly clean!! You are right on the ocean and have great views from almost anywhere in the house except the back bedroom, which my sisters liked since it was quiet and a little removed from the hub bub. The kitchen is totally modern and well stocked, we loved making up Mai Tais and cooking Hawaiian meals to enjoy with the view from the lanai. The bathrooms were unbelievable, beautifully custom made cabinetry and glass enclosures that remind you of ocean waves. Just lovely. The only sound you heard the whole time was the sound of the ocean, which we all loved. Once in a while the sounds of the pool area would drift over and we all thought \"thank goodness we don't have a room near the pool!\" I imagine it could get a little annoying if you were subjected to that for extended periods! We used the pool/hot tub in the evening when all the kids had gone and it was very nice. The grounds are very nice and well maintained. We didn't use much of them since we had the ocean at our front door and didn't need anything else! There is a nice lawn directly in front of the condo with palm trees for shade if wanted and lounge chairs to catch some rays in, with a narrow beach just past a sea wall. The beach is very pretty but you can't really swim there unless you have some beach shoes because there's a lot of coral and rocks. But very nice wading pools develop at low tide for kids to search for shells and for adults to just hang out in. I actually did some snorkeling there but it was a little dicey walking out on the slippery rocks and all. If you walk south (make a left when you hit the beach) you will find plenty of spots to swim without the rocks....and you can walk or run all the way down to Black Rock if you want. If you go north the beach will disappear pretty quickly. But you've got the best of both worlds, you're close to Black Rock and the famous, glitzy Ka'anapali Beach strip and yet you're a little set apart so you don't have all the congestion (and the higher prices!) to deal with. We never heard any traffic from our condo, only the ocean. There's a great Farmer's Market that's open a few days a week right down the road where you can get fresh local produce, try the Maui sweet corn! Yum! And there are plenty of cute little shops close to the condo plus a place to rent snorkel gear. We did most of our shopping within 5 minutes of the condo! We didn't use the office much but everyone was very friendly and accommodating. There is a one time morning breakfast given in a gazebo close by the condo where Expedia gives a little talk about Maui and then offers you tours etc to go on. You can pick whatever day you want to do it....we ended up going on our 4th day there. The talk was informative but I didn't stick around for any of the activity info since I had read my books (and this site) and knew what I wanted to do already. All in all I enjoyed the Papakea in general and LOVED our condo there and can't rave enough about it.

The location is very convenient to Lahaina (only about 5 minutes' drive) for additional shopping and dining options.We booked a Road to Hana tour through the Expedia concierge and enjoyed it very much. The only negatives were relatively minor. The floors could have been cleaned better and more often. They were only mopped once at our request during our 5 days there. Housekeeping services were inconsistent--e.g,. wastebaskets were emptied some days and not others (bathroom wastebasket was never emptied our whole stay!), pillow from sofa bed was stowed in different closets each day, etc. The AC unit is in the living room, not the bedroom, which means the bedroom will always be slightly warmer than the rest of the unit. This was not a problem for my parents, who don't like the AC too cold, but someone who prefers cooler sleeping conditions might want to use the sofa bed in the living room instead.

I rented the unit direct from the owner on a \"vacation rental by owner\" site and saved a LOT. Contact me if you want their info. The Papakea property is fantastic! It's very well-manicured and parking is free (that is a rarity). All buildings have elevators and parking was easy to find at all hours. There are two pools and it was never a problem to get a lounge chair. There are about 5 or 6 gas grills at each pool and they're in high demand around dinner time. The two large cabanas are free to \"rent\", with just a security deposit. Great if you have a large group. The lobby and garden staff were very friendly and helpful. The property has a lot of free perks for their guests, like water-aerobics classes, yoga classes, and putting contests on the property's putting green. There is an Expedia desk in the lobby and on your first morning, they invite you to a free breakfast. The breakfast is just some Costco pastries and the seminar lasts about an hour. It was pretty informative and they gave away a ticket for a dinner cruise (for one person, which was a little shady, but, I guess it works for them) and a bus trip to Hana. I won the Hana trip and went. It was great! You can walk to the grocery store across the street. In the same shopping center are also a dive shop for your snorkel rentals, and a very popular coffee house (Java Jazz).There is no on-site restaurant, but there is one at the resort next door, and a few in the grocery store shopping center across the street. There is also a Farmer's Market a few days a week, about a 1/4 mile down the street. Make sure to go! You'll find a few things that you can't find on the mainland. I recommend this property for anyone looking for a great time at a lower price. You'll save money cooking your own meals a few times on your trip and the units are condos.

This management group never returned any of our calls. I would not recommend using this group as our experience was apparently a common one:according to staff at this resort, this group always refuses to return calls when there is a problem. One unit, C-305, was somewhat updated, but carpets were stained, pillows were like pancakes, mattresses were poor and linens were unmatched, worn and poor quality. The other unit, L-107, was badly in need of an update and had stained carpets and similar mattresses and linens. We will not stay at this resort again, and will not recommend it to anyone we know after this horrible experience and after the disrespectful way that we were treated.

We had a one bedroom ocean-front unit in building F. The property is lovely, well maintained and is easily accessible to the Ka'anapali Beach area. It appears as though all of the units have some amount of ocean view from the balcony. They have 3 buildings that are ocean front (balconies face directly to the ocean). In addition, the property is only about a 15 minute drive from the Front street area of Lahaina (the area with lots of shops and restaurants). It is also very close to a strip mall with a 24 hour grocery store. Upon checking in to our unit, we had a number of small issues that were rather irritating. The key maker wasn't working, so security had to let us in our room whenever we left. In addition, the stove wasn't working properly (burners wouldn't heat up), the toaster was broken, the dishware door was broken, the shower wouldn't drain, etc. Thankfully, the management and maintenance staff were more than willing to do whatever it took to improve our stay. They even offered us our choice of two other units (however we chose to stay in our original). The management quickly fixed or replaced all of the appliances that weren't working, along with the shower drain. They also gave us a discounted rate on our unit. The decor of the unit was a bit outdated. Mostly it was in need of a coat of paint. The walls were banged up from where luggage and/or furniture had been moved in and out. However, it had a lovely tile floor throughout and the ocean front view simply could not be beat. We were on the 3rd floor of building F which is directly on the ocean with views of the northern end of Ka'anapali beach, the islands of Lanai & Molokai and the northern shores towards Napili. We had a gorgeous view of the sun setting over Lanai each night and woke up to sun lighting the green mountains of Molokai. The two pools and jacuzzis where well maintained. The property has a sea wall instead of a beach, but it is in walking distance (less than 5 minutes) to the northern end of Ka'anapali beach. They also provide stairs with sea shore access during low tide. There were also tons of lawn chairs for sun bathing near the sea wall. For experienced snorkelers, there is a lovely reef about 100 yards off the sea wall. Getting out there can be tricky depending upon the tide, but we were able to follow the shoreline down and see many tropical fish and eels.

My daughter and I arrived as we were celebrating her graduation. We were in bldg B which had an excellent view of the garden and the ocean. We spent our time outdoors much of our stay, so with that respect, we loved the grounds of the Papakea, wide open, green and floral. We walked the beach past other condos and agreed that we much prefer the smaller resort to large, highrise ones with massive parking areas and very little grounds to enjoy. Our room was a 1 bedroom and though it was plenty of space for the two of us, it defitely had the 70's look and feel to it. Overall it was clean with the exception of some very small speckles of mold over the shower (mini tub) and when the sunlight cast through the sliding doors, you could see the wall of glass had quite a bit of dust accumulated. We weren't aware of any maid service until we found our bed made by the 3rd or 4th day. I was a bit surprised that there was no dish soap for the kitchen sink, only dishwasher. We purchased a small bottle from the ABC market and left it for the next guest. However, when I saw housekeeping cleaning out the condo across from us, I had the feeling they take anything left in the condo. We enjoyed our meals on the lanai, and enjoyed the yoga classes by the ocean. The host meeting regarding trips was worth it and made it easy to pick and choose what we wanted to do. I would highly suggest the Road to Hana trip (our favorite) and we took a day hike -waterfall trip too (enjoyed). We had great tour guides on both. We highly recommend the Pacific whale foundation Eco tours - though not too impressed with molokini, we loved the turtle town portion; overall an enjoyable trip. The Hyatt Luau was okay, but not worth the money. As you can see, we spent most of our time outdoors, and it was nice to return to the Papakea in the evenings to relax.

The pool area was fun and I would recommended getting their and relaxing before the children arrive! The pool security is really strict on the no floaties or beach balls in the pool.

I found the room to be clean and roomy. Our room was a one bedroom with a full kitchen and a stacked washer and dryer. Our children slept in the bedroom so we could fall asleep to the sound of the ocean (on the sofa bed). The sofa bed was pretty uncomfortable... but fortunately we were tired enough at the end of each day to be able to sleep on it! The room was clean. We did have an issue with ants in the kitchen. That was taken care of after we notified the hotel staff. I learned that Resortquest is one of four management companies for the investment units in Papakea. Resortquest as a whole has certain standards that must be met for the units they manage. Since Resortquest manages the largest percentage of units at Papakea, they run the front desk for all the units at this resort. This may explain some comments by others regarding their experiance at this resort. I don't know this for sure... but perhaps they were staying in a unit that was not being managed by Resortquest. Though Papakea does not have a kids camp on-site, you can sign your kids up at the Resortquest resort next door. Also, I noticed that there were tennis courts on the property.

Everything was spotless and I was impressed by how well stocked the kitchen was with cook ware, dishes, electric appliances, etc. Yes, our building was under construction during our stay, but to be honest, we were only aware of it when we went outside and saw the contractors working. I think more noise was created when the garbage trucks came in to empty the big dumpsters. When I vacation with my children, I tend to look for something a little funky as opposed to really fancy and this definately fit the bill.

When researching hotels, I was slightly disappointed that Papakea did not have a beach in front of it, but this ended up being one of my favorite things about the hotel. When standing inside our room and looking out the window, it actually looked like we were on the water (see photo). The building itself is about 30 feet from the sea wall- if there were a beach there the building would be much further back and we would have seen/heard the people at the beach. There is a nice beach a short (2 minute) walk away. The room itself was small but looked nice. We had a kitchen with fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher (pots/plates/silverware included). If you are considering getting an ocean front room, request building F. The ocean front building next to us had two units being remodeled - construction noise would definitely take away from a relaxing Hawaiian vacation. Your first morning at Papakea you are invited to a free breakfast where you get a lot of information on activities to do- if you don't have your trip planned out, I would go to this to get some ideas. I didn't take the time to figure out if their prices were good- but it was convenient to not have to book things myself. Black Rock beach is a short drive away (park in the parking garage at Whaler's village - go to ABC store and buy $17 underwater camera and have your parking validated). From Whaler's village it's about a ten minute walk to Black Rock beach with amazing snorkeling. We rented our snorkeling gear from the shop right next to the Papakea- you can go through the gate in the parking lot and the store is loated to your right - $5 for the day- store opens at 9am. To get back through the gate you need your room card. Beach towels are available but you have to check them out at the front desk. If you want to access the internet, you have to walk to the hotel next door- the office is located behind the restaurant- it costs $.20/minute and seemed to be dial-up. I only have a few negative things to say about our experience. The housekeepers seemed to do a good job, but for some reason the bottoms of our feet were always black after walking around the room (there is no carpet). When we were checking out, we were told we owed a much higher price than we were expecting. We booked with a 4th night free deal and they had not given us our free night.

There were many areas in which either the facilities did not live up to the promises made, or the staff simply did not do an adequate job. First, we paid extra for an ocean-view condo. What we actually got was a condo from which we could not see the ocean at all, unless we went out to a far corner of the balcony from which we could catch a glimse of the ocean. Both bedrooms actually faced the parking lot, with the added benefit of listening to cars coming in and out all night. When we requested a different room which might actually have fulfilled their promise, we were told there were no other rooms available, and since we had paid for the accommodation in advance, were stuck with what they gave us. The condo was very poorly maintained, with the paint literally peeling off the walls and rust everywhere. One morning we woke to find the carpet soaked as the line feeding the icemaker was evidently leaking. The last weekend we were there was the capper to our experience. Apparently the resort rented a condo to a group having a party, directly below our condo. At 2:30 in the morning, they had a large group of people talking and smoking directly beneath the windows of our bedrooms. When the group refused to quiet down after several requests, I went to the office who said they would take care of it. However, the noise and the smoking went on until after 4:00. My warning to others is that price and value do not always go hand-in-hand.

The check-in process was rough but this was not Papakea's fault. We were booked through a company called Vacations International who completely screwed up our reservation. But I am not giving a review of them but, rather, the resort itself. Suffice it to say, because of Vacations International's mess up, we had to be put in a \"Resort Quest\" room until a Vacation International (V.I.) room became available at the Papakea. However, because of this, we had an excellent opportunity to see how the resort is run by Resort Quest vs. V.I. How a room is furnished including the type of deck furniture that comes with it, the type of toiletries and bath towels, and whether or not you get maid service has everything to do with the company that owns the unit. The Resort Quest unit was very nice. It had carpeting throughout the unit which was unusual but welcome. The furnishings were basic \"beach decor\". Kitchen appliances were a little outdated but no big deal. The toiletries were above average and the towels were thick and fluffy. It had daily maid service. And the unit was very spacious. Two T.V.s and one DVD player. Patio. A/C. Washer & Dryer. All in all, a lovely unit. The only complaint I had about this unit was that it was on the ground floor and in my opinion, any unit on the ground floor lacks privacy. The only other thing about Resort Quest rooms is that they charge a hefty fee to make any phone calls from the unit, even local calls! However, this wasn't a problem in our case, because we just used our cell phones. Also, if you are a Resort Quest guest, you can avail yourself of the concierge and he/she will make any reservations for you, so you don't ever need to make a local call. When we were finally moved into our \"real\" room (a Vacation International-owned room), it, too, was nice but not as nice as the Resort Quest unit. We had an ocean view one bedroom so we had the privacy I require. The view was incredible and, frankly, I wouldn't want an ocean front room. It's a lot more interesting when you can see the ponds and palm trees with the ocean in the near distance. No carpeting in this unit. No daily maid service. The toiletries were very basic and I didn't use them. And the towels were rough and \"scratchy\" compared to the RQ towels. There is no A/C in any V.I. unit. Surprisingly, the appliances were better than the Resort Quest appliances but only marginally. There was a washer & dryer in this unit, too, so I assume every unit at the Papakea comes equipped with a washer & dryer which is very nice. It also had a DVD player and two T.V.s. Overall, the room was pretty decent and if I hadn't seen the Resort Quest room, I wouldn't have known there was anything better at the resort. The one plus of staying in a V.I. room is that local calls are free. But big deal. We had our cell phones. I don't believe, however, you can use the concierge if you are a V.I. guest. And any maintenance or maid issues must be dealt with via phone call to an off-site office. Basically, if your unit is owned by anyone other than Resort Quest, the management on-site at the Papakea wants nothing to do with you. (On-site management is Resort Quest only.) The grounds themselves were superb. Two putting greens. Two swimming pools. Chaise lounges dot the lawn right by the ocean which offers a great view and they are never crowded. When I looked at other resorts in the area, they are all high-rise and the grounds are limited compared to the size of Papakea's grounds. All in all, it's a very low-key resort that caters to families. My only complaint is that there is no restaurant on the premises. However, you can walk one or two resorts down and find restaurants. Besides that, we always go grocery shopping during the first day of any trip and stock our unit for the week so we are not \"restaurant dependent.\" Tiki torches are lit throughout the property each night. And there are huge koi ponds just loaded with fish. Very idyllic setting. We definitely intend to return to the Papakea but will make sure we book a Resort Quest room next time. I was told during check out that oftentimes, V.I. guests who are staying for 3 weeks are made to switch their room two or three times. The whole point of staying in a condo. is to make it as much like home as possible including being able to unpack your stuff. Anyway, Resort Quest is on top of their game and since they own 70% of the units at the Papakea, you can't go wrong booking through them plus they offer a discount for staying multiple nights.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNicest place to stay on Maui\u201d", "Author": "jaybirds", "ReviewID": "UR6918479", "Content": "We stayed at the Papakea for a week in February, 2007 and just loved it.

It was the perfect location for us. We rented a car, and we didn't have any problem with parking during our stay--we have a disabled tag, and we always were able to park close to our condo. Our condo was appointed in a typical time-share way (I think this was an owner/timeshare unit)--nothing was extraordinary, but everything was clean and well maintained. We had a one bedroom unit with full kitchen with a view of the courtyard (and a bit of the ocean beyond) from our lanai--oceanview property. We took the recommendation from another reviewer (04/05) and stayed in a room in the F building. We had no problems with bugs, including roaches. The grounds are quiet at night, the beach is nearby (note that at high tide the beach is no more) and most importantly for us, the property is across the street from a grocery store and a few restaurants. We could walk to the store, grab some food items, and make our own breakfast/lunch. We spent most of our time in Lahaina, so it really worked out well. The staff was friendly and the concierge was knowledgable and helped us book tickets to all the events/activities we wanted to see. This property is not an all-inclusive resort, and I wouldn't select it if I wanted a high-flying, romantic vacation, but this property was perfect for us to spend a week in Maui.

I was weary of the hotel due to the reviews on this website, but it was one of the best that they offered, and I was keeping my fingers crossed that we got one of the nicer condos. Apparently, no amount of finger crossing could help me on this trip. My boyfriend and I were hoping for a romantic, week-long vacation in Maui. When we arrived at the Papakea on September 6, they gave us a partial ocean view room on the second floor. I admit that I have high standards, but I don't think I am wrong in the fact that I was immediately disappointed with the property. It only got worse when we got to our room. The bathroom was pretty gnarly, the couch cushions on the futon were stained AND ripped, and the room was just overall dirty. I was excited to have a kitchen for the week, but I knew immediately that I would not be using the kitchen in this condo. Anyway, the worse part was the bed...it couldn't have been bigger than a double!! I can't believe they gave us a room, knowing that there were two of us, with a double bed. I called downstairs to tell them about the mistake and request a room change, and of course, they were \"completely booked\". They said that they could get us a roll-away (for an extra charge, of course), but that there was nothing else they could do. Yes, that was exactly what I was picturing for our romantic Hawaiian getaway...to sleep in different beds! He claimed that they did not have anything less than a queen sized bed, but I have pictures to prove it. My boyfriend, an average-sized 24 year old, basically took up the entire bed. So I ask what the damage would be if we cancelled our reservation and they said that they would charge us for one night. I then called Hawaiian and they booked us at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel (which I LOVED and highly recommend) for an extra $900 (in addition to the first night paid at the Papakea). Needless to say, I was disappointed that we were not better accommodated and were penalized for a mistake that was not our fault, but I was not willing to fight the charges and gladly got the heck off that property. We were only there for about 20 minutes, thank GOD!!

Three tips: the ResortQuest Kaanapali is next door and has a restaurant (The Beach Club) that runs coupons in the Maui This Week travel guide. Also, the small restaurant across the street is called Soup Nutz and we had a delicious, not ridiculously-priced meal there.

We wanted a smaller location and not a big high rise hotel. We also wanted a condo for more of the \"home away from home\" feeling and something that was on the beach and would still be within 10 minutes drive of Lahaina was important. It seemed like this a good spot, however, I was really concerned with the room we might end up with due to some of the comments found on the web. I booked in January and paid for an upgraded ocean view room. Once you get there you may notice that almost all of the units have some sort of ocean view. Anyhow, to appease my concerns on the room, I called Expedia a month before we arrived and they said that the rooms should all be similar to what is represented on their web page. They also recommended that I call Papakea and convey my concerns to them. I did this and was told by the women who answered the phone that the last week of March is their off season and that moving would not be a problem if I was not happy with our unit. I thought - okay - I'm not going to stress on anything before I'm even there and just let it go. Fast forward about a month....we were there the last week of March when the unusally heavy rains were making national news and Kauai had serious flooding problems. Maui was much better off, but we still had a fair share of rain. When we arrived at Papakea it was the night of a horrible storm - even the locals were talking about how intense it was the next day. Poor visability (driving 2 mph under the street sign and we still couldn't read it due to the rain!) made finding the resort a real challenge so it was 1:00 a.m. by the time we arrived. Upon check-in I mentioned that I had concerns over the condition of the room (which I had yet to see) as I had read about the differences in the units. The older man working the desk said that they were FULL and that this was always a very busy time of year (so somebody lied to me) but if I wasn't happy with the room to let him know and that he would relay the situation to the morning manager. At that point, I didn't care, I just wanted a bed to crawl into. The first unit they gave us was E302, really close to the water, but OLD, OLD, OLD. Nothing had been done to the place and it was NOT what was shown in the expedia web-site. Sent the hubby back to the night desk clerk to inform him that the room is not what we expected and we will need the manager in the morning. Woke up, sun is shining, the room still is not satisfactory even though the rest of the family said it was okay. I go to discuss the situation with the extremely helpful young male manager. He didn't hesitate to offer another room, gave me the key and said check it out before we move all of our stuff and to just let him know if want to keep looking at other units. The first alternate unit, C-209, was great!!! CLEAN, new upgrades, flat screen TV, lots of dresser storage...in fact, it is so much better that even the family admits I was right to move when they see it!!! I thanked the manager and happily moved over to the new spot, which is not as close to the ocean, but the ocean view is still great. It kind of sounds like a downer until now, but really, it still wasn't all that bad. It was just very memorable - we still laugh about it. Everything there (well, anywhere) depends on your attitude. The locals and the tourists are all very friendly as long as you start out being nice to them. Papakea was perfect as the units are only four story buildings. The grounds are as beautiful as any we others we visited. My husband and our boys (ages 14 & 17) loved hanging out on the putting green and by the pools. It was close to Lahaina. The B-B-Q pits were really handy and you could always meet friendly folks that were also grilling their dinner. The beach wasn't much, but due to the rains and the large amount of sediment in the water (which we were told can be more attractive to sharks) we didn't go in the ocean much. When you look into other rooms, which is easy to do at night, you get a good feel from how different the unit styles are.

If you are looking for a beautiful, reasonably priced, 1 bedroom/1 bathroom condo then I highly recommend D202. My one complaint would be that there really isnt a great beach at the Papakea. This problem was easily fixed by taking the 1 dollar shuttle from the Embassy (less than a blocks walk from Papakea) to Whalers Village, which is the location of the beautiful Kaanapali Beach as well as shopping and a few restaruants (loved Leilanis). Kaanapali Beach was great to swim at, relax on the beach, and Black Rock (in front of the Sheraton Hotel) provided some great off shore snorkeling. The concierge at the Papakea was extremely helpful in booking activities (we booked the Royal Lahaina Luau through the conceirge and got seats in the very front), etc. There is also a Star Market right across the street that is open from 5am-2am that has all your grocery needs, which helps cut back on money spent on food. All in all, it was a fabulous vacation and the Papakea was a great place to stay. Oh, and one last tip, I highly recommend renting a car or using airport shuttle service and the Maui Transit for transportation, as taxi rides are extremely expensive.

It had all new appliances in the kitchen, a washer and dyer, a nice patio set on the lanai and most importantly it had an absolutely beautiful ocean view.

We slept with the doors and windows shut and air conditioner off and it didn't get stuffy until about 7am but when we woke up we opened the huge sliding glass door and the room immediately aired out. Another reason we loved Papakea was because on our second day there we were pleasantly surprised by a bottle of Champagne and a card welcoming us and congratulating us on our marriage.

I had mixed feelings about the property and the unit itself. I booked it through a private owner on [--].It is a 2br/2ba unit. The owner was terrific to deal with, but I must admit the unit itself left something to be desired. The carpet appeared very dirty, as was the couch in the living room. The kitchen area was nice, with nice cabinets and adequately stocked. It had all the necessary appliances and they were in good shape. The furniture in both bedrooms was very basic. The towels were a real mish mash and all had a very strange smell to them. I had to wash them before we could use them.There were beach toys and boogie boards in the unit for your use. The view from the condo was terrific, though. You can see the ocean from the lanai and had a full view too. The unit was located right in front of the elevator, which was a plus and a minus. Plus for ease of use(but the stairs were close by and faster to use), minus in that you hear the ding of the elevator as it goes up and down all day and night. There was a safe in the unit, but no key for it. The ceiling fan in the master bedroom was very dirty and made very loud clacking noises on anything but low speed. The property grounds were very well manicured. They really don't have much of a beach area and what they do have is kind of icky in both sand and water. The pool area is nice, but the water in the pool was always cloudy and that concerned me. The hot tub was nice, though and the water in it sparkled. They keep chaise lounges near the ocean to lie in. They have a number of BBQ grills near the pool to use. They also have a putt-putt course and shuffleboard. My biggest complaint about Papakea is the noise level. The walls in these units are VERY thin. We could hear our neighbors using the toilet! You can imagine what other kind of sounds we heard. Also, the windows in the bedrooms of all units are horizontal slats at the top of the wall. The air conditioner is in the living room, so in order to help keep it cool, you have to open those slatted windows, because the air conditioner doesn't really reach well into the bedrooms. But opening the windows allows every outside sound in. The walkway is right outside the bedrooms, so you hear people talking as they walk by, doors slamming and such. The buildings are laid out in such a way that the sound echoes throughout. Also, they have huge plantings of trees in the \"courtyard\" area between the buildings and there are tons of birds that like to start singing VERY early. Twice during our stay we heard crying children at night and it was clear they were not near us. The layout and thin walls just makes the sound carry. I heard other people that were staying in different buildings talking about it too. Would I stay here again? Probably not.

I understand some units are more worn than others, since they are privately owned it's basically up to the owner to make the decisions regarding the unit. We found the maid service and personnel wonderful. The key is treating people with respect and being appreciative if there is something they can do. Though it is not a deluxe property by any means, it is adequate and provides relief from having to run out for meals all the time. Stock up on food and liquor and enjoy the beauty and warmth of Hawaii.

I called four days before our arrival to make sure we had two bedrooms with two queen beds, as their were two couples staying in the condo. I was assured that the room would be ready for us.

The room we were moved to only had air conditioning in the living room, the bathrooms were like saunas. These units seem to be seperately owned, and ours was in need of extensive repairs. Also, the tile floors were filthy. The toaster didn't work and you almost needed to be a rocket scientist to open the kitchen cabinets. It is posted around the complex that quiet time is from 10:00 pm to 7:00 am. We were told the TV was too loud at 11:00 pm, but every morning from 5:00 am on the maintenance workers were out with their squeeky carts and talking loud.

I had read several reviews like this one before we booked, and they had it from 'Awful' to 'Fabulous'. I would lean to the fabulous side, but not too far.

If you are used to the Ritz-Carleton level of service, then you will be less than happy at the Papakea. Our daily maid service quality depended on who the maid actually was. Unfortunately the excellent maid was ours for only two of the ten days we were there. We were on the 2nd floor. Having been there now, I would have preferred the 3rd or 4th, and never the 1st. The 1st is ground level. As I walked to the pool I could, and did, look into the various units to see how they were outfitted. Not much privacy, as I was often looking at people looking at me. The grounds were kept immaculate, with fallen leaves and debris cleaned up daily. The pools were beautiful, the hot tubs hot. There is not much of a beach, especially at high tide, but I considered that a plus, since I could sit next to the sea wall, and therefore next to the sea. There was a full beach we could use a couple of minutes walk away. The front desk was very helpful with any questions. The negatives: We had several friends in other facilities and I found it annoying that I had to pay $1 for every local call. The air conditioning consists of a window unit in the living room by the balcony, not much good for the bedroom. We tried it for the first night, then opened all the windows in the place on the second and subsequent nights, and slept much better. Fortunately October begins Maui's winter season, so the humidity was not high. The Aston Papakea was an excellent value for the money. You don't get the Ritz, but you don't pay the Ritz prices either.

The beach in front of the Papkea is narrow, but the snorkeling is great there. Our family felt it was better than either Black Rock or Molokini both of which we visited. So you can just step outside and do some quick snorkeling. And you can get to wider beaches by just walking a short distance south. Lots of lounge chairs on the grass bordering the beach. Papakea has a great concierge--very helpful. Be warned that they push the Expedia stuff since they are an Expedia member, but you do get discounts. Skip the luau at the Royal Laina unless you have lots of kids who can go for free. The submarine ride was great as was the Warren & Annabelle show in Lahaina. Skip the Aloha Mixed Plate restaurant in Lahaina. Rude servers and refusal to give separate checks to our large group of 3 families. Vino in Kapalua is wonderful--and very reasonable.

The stairs were narrow and steep to the loft and it wouldn't work for our situation. Two of us are somewhat disabled so we went back to the front desk to arrange for switching to another room. The manager immediately jumped in realizing our problem and assigned us two separate units, A104 and A106 on the first floor of the same building. You couldn't have asked for nicer accomodations. Ocean front and all of the amenities of the larger single unit. One of the units was a one bedroom and the other was a studio unit, both with fully equiped kitchens. Our units had been upgraded by the individual owners and needed very little. The Papakea is convenient to local shopping with the Star Market across from the entrance and the complex was quiet at night. It's not a luxury resort, but it appears to be well maintained, nicely appointed and met our needs. I would recommend the Papakea Beach Resort to others. The beach is small, but enough to walk along. Those who want to jump in the salty ocean would have no problem with little interference of rocks. Those that want larger beaches to lie on can find them a short distance from this resort. If you're looking for a medium to upper grade condo this is the place. If you want high luxury book somewhere else. The pictures in the adds gives you an idea of what the units look like and are probably pretty to true to form.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Incline Village, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Jam530", "ReviewID": "UR3522489", "Content": "I have read the other reviews.

The tile floor was not very clean when we checked-in, there were spots on floor that needed wiping and some traces of sand. And of course they never cleaned the floor the whole time we were there. That didn't bother us as much, since we were also tracking sand and dirt inside whenever we came in and we don't walk barefoot. What we found very annoying and frustrating is that for 8 out of the 10 nights we were there, we had to call for extra towels all the time, especially annoying when you come back to the unit late at night.

There were many covered cars and boats in the lot which appeared to be in temporary storage for owners - relocating those could free up daily spots.

Have you every returned to a place that was a great experience and been disappointed that the second trip didn't live up to the memories of the first ? When we decided to return to Hawaii there was no question in our minds that we wanted to go back to the Papakea. What we didn't know was if we would be disappointed. We weren't. We booked an oceanfront room (L-301) thru Maui Resort Management and we found the room very exceptable. Sunsets, whales breaching and the sound of the ocean coming ashore all make this a very special place. So special that I even called a co-worker back home to gloat and let him hear the ocean. Room L-301 is located on the 3rd floor at the outside edge of the resort next to the canal. This was a great location because it tended to be quieter (not that noise is a problem) and the side window of the living area gave us a beautiful nightly view of the sun setting. When I booked the room Maui Resort Management e-mailed me pictures of the room so I knew exactly what I was walking into. I found this a great comfort so I could avoid the dreaded, SUPRISE! One really neat thing we tried this year was Zip-lining through Skyline EcoAdventures. This was a real neat experience that had the boys asking if we could go again.

The property grounds are gorgeous and are well kept up. The condos are neat and clean. This condo is located on the ocean where there isn't really a beach. I have never found that to be a problem, because there are many other beaches in Maui that I go to for snorkeling, swimming, etc. Papakea never feels overly crowded either, at other hotels there are many people sitting at the pool and lounge chairs galore around the property, that it is almost difficult to walk. There are grills by the pool, so you could grill out if you wanted. There is a grocery store basically across the street from the condo; the prices are a little high. Both times that I have been to Papakea, I have stayed in an ocean view room. My sister has stayed in the oceanfront. We both agreed that we like the ocean view because you can see the gorgeous grounds and also the ocean. She liked the oceanfront because all you can see is the ocean, but for cost she prefers the ocean view. I feel that the staff at Papakea is very accommodating. We made our reservations a year in advance because we would need two rooms. Because all the condos are personally owned, they never know which rooms will be available and when. We wanted to have our rooms in the same unit. However they couldn't put us both in the type of room we had reserved, so they upgraded one of the rooms to keep us in the same unit. We also had a problem with the toilet one night and someone was at our door within 5 minutes to fix it. There are cats located on the property, but they don't bother anyone. They are there to keep down on rodents and are fed by the resort. So they are not bothering people for food. The only negative that I can think of is that it isn't located near shopping and restaurants. So you need to drive around 5 minutes to get to them.

We went across the street to the Star market and bought groceries and cooked breakfast there and by the pool they have many BBQ's for your use we went and got Steaks from the Star Market and had a BBQ one night by the pool it was very relaxing. There is also an ABC store in front and we bought many gifts and items from there I would definetely stay here again we went to the Hyatt just to check it out and the Hyatt is a four star hotel but it was so crowded you could not find anywhere to lay by the pool or the water so we just looked around and left right away I liked the Papakea because there was not many people and we always had seats by the pool and by the water it was great . The only thing is if you are looking for a resturant there is not one at the Papakea but we did walk next door to the Kannapali Shores and we had breakfast there one morning, they also serve lunch and dinner. And there was a lot of rocks out in the Ocean in front of the hotel so the kids did do a lot of snorkeling saw many great fish but they did have to wear water shoes because the rocks were rough and there really is no sandy beach to lay on but they do have a nice grass area and I really liked that.

First time in Maui. Maui is great if you prefer rest and relaxation and tours of naturally occuring sites such as waterfalls.

Great if you have rented a car. I am not sure what the cost of a taxi would be each way. The grounds are nice but the beach is very narrow. At high tide the water comes right up to the retaining wall leaving very little or no beach. One is better off at another condo and/or hotel if a large or wide beach is wanted. At high tide, the only option is the resort's two pools. You have the option of eating in or out here. If one eats in then you can walk across the road to a supermarket or several fast food restaurants. There is also the option of calling Pizza Hut or the like. Most of the better restaurants are in Lahaina requiring you to drive or call a taxi. One more thing. Although the resort indicates that it has air conditioning, the only one is in the living room. However, the air is essentially blocked by the sofa and does not extend to the bedroom. In the bedroom there is no air conditioning. Only a ceiling fan which does not do it. When the day and/or evening temperatures are in the 70's or 80's with humidity the lack of air conditioning in the bedroom requires one to stay or sleep in the living room.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherwood, OR", "Title": "\u201cPoor customer service\u201d", "Author": "Tiffanylynnsanders", "ReviewID": "UR2785812", "Content": "We stayed at the Papakea about 5 years ago.

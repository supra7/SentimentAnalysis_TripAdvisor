The Howard Johnson Inn - Dallas on the LBJ Freeway (Abrams Road) was the worst motel I have ever seen in my life. First of all--when we got there, the exterminator was there--asking the desk lady if they had any cockroaches and crickets that day, and she replied nope, not today! I am sorry, but what am I, someone needing a place to stay, supposed to think when I hear this? I immediately got a refund, which I still had to pay for one night, since I did not cancel my reservation in time, and we went to the Budget Suites just down the street. The Budget Suites on Forrest Lane was an excellent place to stay. They had nice rooms, which were like apartments, and friendly staff. The rates were not much more than the Cockroach Motel I had planned to stay at in the first place. So my advice....if you want to stay in that area...go to Budget Suites--you will not regret it!", "Date": "Jan 13, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR758251511", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d98678-r12934499-Howard_Johnson_Inn_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "98678", "Price": "$50"}}

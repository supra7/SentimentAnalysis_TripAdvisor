The safe in the room got locked by my little girl and we didn't know the code to unlock it and we called the front desk and she came up to unlock it for us at 10:30 at night which I thought was very nice of her. The elevators were tiny, but fast. They had a awesome breakfast which was included in the hotel price which was very good with lots of variety eggs, sausage, toast, waffles, cereals and more.

My aunt did call the hotel more than once to confirm that we could in fact park the trailer in their lot. We also went into the lobby upon arrival to confirm again that this would be ok. The girl (I believe her name was Angela) said yes, we could park the trailer there. The lot is gated and there are no pull through parking spots (a detail that no one seemed to find relevant when my aunt called). It took my father over an hour to pull in and get situated in a way that he took the minimal amount of spots, could pull out and other guests could pull in. As we were maneuvering this, the connection for his lights from his truck to the trailer was ripped apart. We got situated and left to see New Orleans. When we came back to check into the second room, a new desk clerk was there and she said the manager stated the trailer needed to be moved. We asked to speak to the manager. The manager said that no one would have said that it would be OK to park the trailer there. While she might not have approved this, other hotel staff did in fact approve this. Rather than owning up to a mistake that her staff made, and letting us park there for three week days when there were no events going on, she insisted that the trailer be removed at 7pm in the evening with no lights. My father was obviously upset about the situation and the manager acted as if he were out of line and escalated the situation by raising her voice to him and acting as if she had been threatened. Not once did we get an apology for their mistake. Needless to say, we did get the trailer out of their lot, to make room for the manager and her staff to park. They did in fact help make phone calls to a local RV park, where we would have gone in the first place, had we not been told that it would be OK to park the trailer at this hotel. That is the only amount of credit that I can give to this manager. And she did it because I stated to her that because my father was upset and he had no lights, there was a good chance that there would be an accident. I was extremely disappointed in the way that the manager handled the situation. Things could have worked out much differently. Yes, the employees DO park in the lot on the hotel property, per the manager when she replied to my aunt; this is because it is not busy season. There is a lot a block or so away, and if you are a guest and you have the clearance, you can park there and walk to your hotel. My recommendation to this hotel would be to send managers through some customer service classes and not to allow them to park in hotel guest parking.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deer Park, Texas", "Title": "\u201cguest NOT number 1 priority\u201d", "Author": "Helen G", "ReviewID": "UR129935665", "Content": "Appear to want to ditch 3rd party guest, when they can get more from walk ins.

No I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have proof of what was actually said, but why else would I call the hotel direct? I was basically called a liar in front of my family and other hotel guests. During our conversation to resolve this issue, several other guests had arrived to inquire about walk in rates. They were told near double what we had paid. At that point it appeared Best Western was trying to get us out so they could double the revenue for our rooms. We did end up moving trailer to another location and did get a refund for 1 room.

The internet worked great. The continental breakfast was one of the best - eggs! It was always clean and nicely stocked. The days were humid and hot and each afternoon when we arrived back at the hotel there was lemonade and tea waiting on us in the lobby. Then cookies as a snack too!

Value. Especially during Mardi Gras, when this area is near parade routes, but even at other times, this hotel is more expensive than the Best Western St. Christopher (on the edge of the French Quarter). I think the biggest difference between the two is the location that you prefer. I don't want to pay more to stay in the Garden District, but I could think of people who would. Rooms. These are a little smaller than normal and don't have work desks or in-room safes. My room faced the parking lot behind the hotel and was fairly quiet. On previous visits I didn't have a problem with noise either. I love the room decor which is bright and contemporary. It looks better than most BWs I've visited. Also, there is an extra sink next to the closet space near the door, which works well when there are multiple people in a room. Location. It is on St. Charles with a streetcar stop almost in front of the hotel. St. Charles and its nearby areas have more good restaurants than the French Quarter IMO and the streetcar is an incredibly efficient way of getting to them. Also, the French Quarter is not walking distance from the hotel, but the streetcar takes you to Canal Street, which is the border of the Quarter. The hotel is also quite close to Loyola and Tulane Universities as well as Audubon Park/Zoo. This particular area of St. Charles is residential. It should be noted that part of the hotel is built on top of a restaurant, Superior Grill. This is convenient, but it enhances the possibility for noise. It hasn't bothered me, but I've never been in a room directly over it. Cleanliness. The room was reasonably clean. I was there for a half-marathon and spent more time than normal in the bathroom to ice my legs. I noticed that the bathroom wasn't exactly spotless, but it wasn't anything you'd notice unless you spent 30-45 minutes in there looking around. Service. The front desk staff struck me as nice, but in a couple of cases simply weren't able to accommodate me. I arrived around 3:15PM and my room was not ready. Since the hotel was fully booked, they couldn't give me another room. I waited in the lobby for a little more than an hour and two calls by the clerk to the housekeeper and my room still wasn't ready. The clerk agreed to hold my bag while I went next door to Superior Grill to eat dinner. I returned about 6:30PM and my room was ready. I was not the only person waiting for a room. (Throughout my stay, I noticed that housekeeping seemed to occur late in the day, about 1-4 PM. It wasn't difficult to notice because the housekeeper on our floor blasted music in the rooms she was cleaning.) Second, I asked the front desk for some information about street closures occurring that weekend and they weren't aware of them. It's a relatively minor issue, but there were multiple people asking and they never got answers. Sleep Quality. My room was quiet and the bed relatively decent. Notes.

The hotel sits above a restaurant that emits a putrid smell into the rooms/hotel. We had to change rooms due to clogged toilet, then after my family was alseep, the toilet in the 2nd room clogged up! I had to go down to the lobby restroom in the middle of the night. Halls are dimly lit and closed in and somewhat \"creepy\", especially in the middle of night by yourself. After using the lobby restroom, I told the staff member about our 2nd room having a clogged toilet. She made me feel as if it was our fault and said something like \"well, this will be our 3rd room and you're going to have to move your family\". I told her my family was asleep and all I needed was a key to another room close by for bathroom use, and proceeded to explain that whether I move my family or not, it would still mean a 3rd room so why would I need to move my sleeping family? She then told me she would have to charge me for that 3rd room! I immediately asked her to call her mgr. and she did get on the phone, but to the maintenance staff who told her to give me a key to another room. Then finally I got into the 3rd room where I slept so I could be near the bathroom because I had an upset stomach. This room overlooked the roof, and I heard loud talking in the middle of the night and looked out the window and saw plumbers on the roof cleaning out some type of plumbing pipes with gloves! Disgusting! It was a terrible experience and wish we would have moved over to the Hamptom Inn next door at the first sign of trouble.

Both of my rooms were clean and comfortable, and had been remodeled fairly recently. Ditto for the bathrooms, which were clean and attractive. (The carpeting in the hallways, however, is due for a shampoo or a change-out.) A word of caution about room location: I stayed at this hotel almost 30 years ago, and knew that a room over the adjacent restaurant (now called the Superior Grill) would be noisy, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. And to ensure a quiet room, I opted out of a view of St. Charles Avenue -- with a view of St. Charles, you'll be listening to the street cars rumble by for most of every 24-hour period. I ask for a room that isn't over the restaurant and that looks out over the hotel's small private and gated parking lot.

The room itself appeared to have been renovated in the last year or two, and was clean, had adequate work space and storage in the furniture and comfortable linens on the bed. The beds are doubles, but since the rooms are big, it would have been nice if they had put in queens. The major problem was that our room faced a rooftop full of HVAC equipment which apparently included the exhaust system from the kitchen of the adjacent restaurant. The room continually smelled like a smoky, greasy grill. It was overwhelming each time we entered from the hall. My clothes still smelled like that when I returned home, and everything I took had to be laundered to remove the smell. Aside from the annoyance of the smell, I can't imagine that it is healthy to breathe whatever is causing the odor. When I asked the staff, I received a variety of responses from \"no one's ever mentioned it\" to \"all the rooms facing that way smell bad\". You can pay extra to reserve a room facing St. Charles, so perhaps that would avoid the odor problem. (They did offer to let me move to another room, but could not promise it would not have the same bad smell. Since I was hurrying to get to an all-day meeting, I declined.) My only other concern is the size of the parking lot. We were lucky enough to get a gate opener, which I was told would insure a space in the lot in the back, and there was always space. However, the lot does not appear to have as many spaces as the hotel has rooms, and the alternate parking is a garage in the next block. There is no obvious place to load or unload, other than at curbside, if you don't get a spot in the parking lot. That could be a problem for someone with lots of luggage.

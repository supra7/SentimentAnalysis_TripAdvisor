It states it is by the airport but in fact it is a 10 minute drive away so don't be fooled.

Room had a fridge, stove, microwave, and all the amenities that one would need for a night or even a few days. A costco is right across the street and a few other restaurants scattered around it for breakfast. The value was incredible for the room that we received.

What's important to me is an inexpensive clean room. The fact that they have a fridge, stovetop, microwave & dishwasher are, in my mind, a big plus. These places were designed for people who are staying for an extended time usually doing some temporary work in the area. You're likely to find a lot of tradespeople, salespeople and folks that have sold a home and are waiting to move into a new one. I've also met a number of retirees travelling on a budget. For these groups this place is a perfect fit. Most of the complaints that I've read about ESA seem to be from people who have unreasonable expectations. These are not resort destinations like a Marriot or a Hilton. I like to think of them as a \"workingman's hotel.\" I stayed here last night before driving down to Tucson. I chose it for it's proximity to the airport. My room was extremely well laid out and clean. There was a sofabed & a queensize, a cathode TV (not a flatscreen) with a remote that needed a battery. (isn't that always the case with hotels?) The two kitchenette chairs were obviously new, but the sofabed was worn & a little threadbare. No problem, I turned one of the cushions over and it looked fine. In general, the room suted my needs just fine. following are what I consider the good and the not-so-good about this, and the entire chain of ExtendedStay America, hotel: The Good - Great water pressure and hot water in the shower. There is nothing worse then a morning shower that feels like it's coming from a garden hose on the \"sprinkler\" setting. Proximity to the airport - less then a 15 minute drive. Very clean Well laid out kitchen. Where improvements could be made: The bed. This is my biggest complaint with all the ExtendedStay America Hotels that I have stayed in. The bed is hard. Not firm, hard. Rock hard. Guys, please upgrade your mattresses. That would certainly raise you at least a star in the reviews. The shower curtain. Most hotels have gone to the type of curtain rod that semicircles the shower curtain out of the tub. Not here. Since this was a business trip I traveled without my wife. But I almost thought that she was in the shower with me the way the shower curtain kept wanting to wrap itself around me.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perrysburg, OH", "Title": "\u201cTerrific value, clean and convenient\u201d", "Author": "flyermontana", "ReviewID": "UR119881527", "Content": "I've stayed at ESAs before that were pretty dismal.

We were finally given our room key and sent along only to find the manager running around in our room spraying air freshner like a crazy person and the maid still trying to vacuum. We stood there like morons waiting with our bags in hand as the manager said \" oh did you want to come in here?\" even though she had called down to the office to send us up. We got into our room only to find the ac not working on a 105 degree day. When we called the front desk the girl argued with us about our interpretation of a broken ac. We were placed in a new room that was just as stinky and disgusting and the ac was more like a fan, which just doesn't cut it.

It is near the rental car facility and the airport. I saw modest but clean houses in the area along with a Costco and Sears across the street - not quite the slums as some saw it. The outside was clean and quiet. It is not located in a 'hotel row' area. It is not a Deluxe Extended Stay so there is no Continental breakfast. There is a small kitchen with microwave, 2 burner stove and full size fridge. Yes the room could use a fresh coat of paint and the bed a new bedspread but it was clean. Everything worked included the A/C. Concerning Tripadvisor reviewers: be advised that we are 'cup is half full or half empty' types. Regardless of the number of stars a hotel has there are those who go out of their way to find fault. If you cannot handle a modest hotel that is probably ready for a remodel but basically does the job in providing a clean place to sleep then for the money this is a good deal. If you want a nice new hotel surrounded by other nice new hotels then be prepared to pay 2x-3x the price.

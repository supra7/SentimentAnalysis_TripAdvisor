The rooms were filthy and the area is unsafe. There were too choices for the heat ... full blast and off. Since it was cold outside, I opted for full blast, which resulted in a room temperature of about 92 degrees. There are dozens of cats roaming the exterior of the property, along with food dishes, etc. -- presumably to address a rodent problem (I did not see any rodents). The front desk is safely behind bulletproof glass and, depending on the time of night, a retractable steel curtain. That will give you an idea of how safe you are in your room with large plate glass window and flimsy door lock. I slept maybe 2-3 hours per night -- maybe -- with lights on the whole time. We did not return, needless to say. If it had not been for the fact that I was a brand new employee, I would have refused to stay there.

After reading some we went to the front desk and shared what we found so they could see what their guests were writing about their experiences. We got a new room and 20% off the bill.

From that point on, we were awoken by the slamming door of the room next store every 30 minutes or so. We can only imagine this was due to 'frequent guests' visiting the room next occupied by prostitutes. We hoped that this was only and issue for the first night of our stay and remained hopeful that the second night would be better. However the same happened the next night, and it was worse.

The Redsox were playing Orioles that weekend and everything was booked up. However, even the Bostonians stayed away from this place. It looked like the motel from the Psycho and Halloween movies. Loaded with transients, the city must put the homeless up there. Anyhow, I am not against that, but when I take my grandkids to visit someplace for the weekend, I don't want to deal with that. The room smelled, was small and cramped. Besides the transients living there, it appears they hire some of them to staff the place as well. Worse the motel charged us as well as Hotels.com and we had to fight like hell to get it all sorted out. We got there late in the evening so had to stay for the night, but pulled out at sunrise. Lessons to take away, 1. check out the reviews, 2. don't use Hotels.com, they have bad customer service and I always find the hotel motel cheaper by using the hotel's own website.

There were people drinking out in the parking lot and I also believe that there were drugs deals going down. I called the front desk to report these things.

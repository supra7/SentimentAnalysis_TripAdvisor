Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations! Star, who worked in reservations, greeted us with warmth and kindness every day and went above and beyond with any need that we had. Whether it was suggesting a restaurant, helping us with the transportation system routes, giving us a room with a great view... she made us feel at home. Jason, who I believe works in guest services, is a wonderful addition to your staff! He went out of his way for us, making sure our dining experience in the evening went smoothly. I believe they were short-handed, and he was helping out in the dining room.I would like to add that dinner is free, Monday through Thursday, with free beer and wine as well. He also took us to a room on the top floor that we wanted to take a look at for our next stay there in June. His attentiveness to any of our needs was well appreciated. Another name I would like to mention is Roger, who I believe to be the manager of the hotel. He was friendlier than any manager I have met in quite some time and my husband and I travel quite a bit. He helped us print our boarding passes on our check out day, and then directed us to where we could leave our luggage with the bellhops, since our flight was not until 7:30 p.m., and gave us a late check out. That way, we could enjoy our day downtown without having to have our luggage with us. Once again, thanks to all the staff at Homewood Suites!

I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11\" tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet. On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast!

We pulled up to the front of the building where we were greeted by hotel staff who helped us unload and valet parked our car in a nearby garage. Being a hotel in the midst of downtown, the ground floor is not much more than elevators that take you up to the main lobby on the 6th Floor. The room we stayed in was on the 12th floor and had a nice view of downtown. The room itself was a nice suite. Although not brand new, the room was clean and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable to sleep on. It may have been the best sleep I've ever got at a hotel. The kitchen area of the room was one of the highlights with enough kitchenware for the average traveler to prepare their own meals if they desired. The cleaning staff did an excellent job straightening up after us each day. The hotel offered free breakfast and the offering was great. The breakfast eggs were fantastic. If you're adding in meal costs, this was a huge plus with getting delicious, hot breakfasts cooked for us each day. They do offer a diner M-F each night but with being in a great restaurant city like Chicago, we splurged for eating out (By the way, I highly recommend the Big Bowl Thai restaurant nearby. Everything is fresh and was the best restaurant we ate at. Ginos East and Al's Beef were ok. Heaven on Seven was good too.) The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. We made a few special requests which they were prompt in service. Location in downtown Chicago couldn't be better. You're two short blocks from Michigan Ave (Magnificant Mile) with tons of restaurants nearby within walking distance. Leave your car in the lot and take the bus where you want to go. Bus routes can take you easily to the museums, united center, willis (Sears) tower, the loop, just about any place downtown. It's the cheapest way to travel downtown and other passengers are average people. Without question I would stay at this hotel again.

On the plus side, the location is great, the rooms are spacious and clean, the beds are comfortable, most of the staff is friendly and helpful, check in was done promptly. On the downside the hotel smells old and smoky, breakfast is suitable for non-fussy children only. Additionally, I booked the $10.00 Parking Suite deal which was my deciding factor on this hotel and noticed my final bill had the full charge. At the end of an extremely discouraging conversation, the charges were removed from the bill. The one thing that struck me odd about the conversation is that the front desk staff stated she had this same conversation with many people before me about the applicability of this deal. So my outstanding question is that if you know it is not clearly marked as applicable in certain situations why don't you fix it and then you wont have any conversations in the future because it's clear. So my tip for those of you booking this deal are as follows: When you see the rate options available to you if the Parking Suite deal does not come up it will not apply to you. This applies even if the Corporate code populates in your confirmation.

For the price, this hotel far exceeded our expectations. No, it's not the Ritz-Carlton, and there's sometimes a bit of a wait for the elevator, but $130 a night for a suite downtown including parking, two meals/day, and taxes? We got a great deal! First I'd like to say that all of the employees we came across were pleasant and friendly. Opening doors, greeting you when they see you, etc. I guess that's just common courtesy, but it's rare these days, I feel like half the places I go to eat, shop, etc, the employees act disinterested and sometimes annoyed. (How dare I come into your establishment and spend money!?!) That was not the case at Homewood Suites. It is obvious that the staff there has been trained to make you feel comfortable and \"at home\". In 6 days we didn't run into one curt, aloof, or even less-than-pleasant employee. That's saying a lot!! The room itself isn't that large for a suite, but it's definitely larger than a standard hotel room. This isn't one of those \"suites\" that has a sitting/sleeping area all in one like a studio apartment. The bedroom and living room/kitchen are two separate rooms. You can shut the door in the bedroom and not hear much from the living room. This was great for us because we traveled with my 2 y/o son who still naps. The pull-out sofa, like most, is not very comfortable. We didn't really use it (just tried it once for a nap), but I would not want to be sleeping there for five nights. Again, this is not uncommon for a sleeper sofa. I don't think a comfortable one exists. The bed, on the other hand, was very comfortable. Having the small kitchen area was great. As far as amenities, the pool and fitness center are both located on the 19th floor. The pool is very nice and doesn't have a deep end. No hot tub. The fitness center has two treadmills, two recumbent bikes, an elliptical, and a few weight machines and a bench. My husband was up there every morning and never had a problem getting a treadmill, but I did think the fitness center was a little small for the size of the hotel. I wonder if when it's busy, the gym gets really crowded? The hotel was def. not at capacity when we were there. The breakfast is far better than most continental breakfasts. They serve real eggs, unlike the Hampton Inn :) The quality of dinner varied by night, but it was definitely much better than I expected. We went down all but one night for dinner - the beef brisket was excellent, the ravioli/pasta night was pretty bad, most everything else was in between. The only bad thing I can say about the hotel, as has been mentioned in previous reviews, is the wait time for the elevators. When we visited (Jan 8-13) the hotel was fairly empty, or so it seemed. Still, I had to wait a minute or two for an elevator about every other time I used it. Not a big deal, but it did make me wonder how long the average wait is during the summer when they are busy.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Homewood Suites - Chicago!\u201d", "Author": "seekingsun4", "ReviewID": "UR123232158", "Content": "We stayed at the Homewood Suites - Chicago from January 13-15, 2012.

We got a suite that had a sofa with a separate bedroom, two tvs (one in front of the sofa, one in the bedroom), a small dining table, a kitchen with an oven, a fridge. We had free breakfast (the usual fare but good enough) and free weekday dinners (yes, dinner, but nothing great and it would be a shame not to try the many great restaurants in the area). Free coffee in the lobby and free wifi all over the hotel (including the rooms). And let's not forget the location. It is in the heart of downtown Chicago.

It was quiet for the first 10 days before Christmas. Then Christmas through January 1st was busy. Today it's back to being a slow going, chill place. So, be mindful of when you go and take what is said about things like that.into consideration. Breakfast (and dinner) will also be very busy during these times. With that said, this is a great place to stay. A couple minutes from the Mag Mile, and a bit further and you're at Navy Pier. Some of the other attractions (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, etc) are technically within walking distance, but it's probably best to buy a 3-day transportation pass to get to those. The breakfast can tend to become old quickly, if you stay for an extended period of time. (We've been here 19 nights as of tonight, leaving in the AM to go back home.) They swap up a few things like the meat on the bar. Can be bacon, sausage patty, or sausage link. Change up the second batch of eggs at times as well, and maybe once in a while one of the three cereals. But having breakfast really saved us a lot of money. The big selling point for us was the free wifi and kitchen. The free wifi requires you sign in once a day, so no biggie there. The kitchen is awesome for being away from home so long. No oven, so can limit you a bit. But the stove top and all is nice, as well as a dishwasher so you don't have to worry about washing dishes while here. Toaster also included as is a coffee maker and some other small amenities. The staff here is amazingly helpful. Able to help us find things in area as well as provide change for the washer/dryer. The staff at the door are always a nice group, welcoming you back and all. There are some minor inconveniences we've encountered while here that I should note. I read in another review that the drain in the tub is slow. This is true. We've also had water issues. Not pressure issues, but our water being cool to luke warm. They had someone come up while we were out during the day to look at it, but it still didn't seem to help much. This issue seemed to crop up right around Christmas, so I'm not sure if it was just being a busy in general issue or what. Considering it's winter, warm to hot water for showers is a bit important. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again and would make this my go to hotel. Price versus what you get AND location? This is a great place to stay.

We have stayed at a variety of hotels near/on Michigan Avenue and this place is the best value overall. Honestly, I don't know why they do not charge more for this hotel (anybody from Hilton reading this...pay no attention to that comment :-) ). The first time we stayed here was Thanksgiving weekend of 2009 and found it very comfortable and priced very reasonably. The second time was this year (2011), again for Thanksgiving weekend. The Homewood Suites has a great breakfast buffet that never seemed to be out of anything even with the large crowd of families staying there for Thanksgiving weekend shopping and family get-togethers. Thanksgiving afternoon and evening was a special treat with a full traditional Thanksgiving buffet meal for guests...free! We had reservations at a nearby restaurant but canceled those and decided to try the buffet instead and we were pleasantly surprised. Granted, the food wasn't anything over the top, but was really quite good and they had wine and beer too. We really enjoyed the food and the opportunity to just chill out and have some family time over dinner. During a normal week (Sun-Thurs I believe) they have a dinner buffet for guests that caters to the business travelers. As for the rooms, we had a suite that consisted of a living room area and kitchenette with a table and chairs that could be used for eating meals which would be great for families with children, but since we were there on \"Black Friday\" for shopping, the table got used for a spot to put all of the shopping bags. The sofa opened up into a sleeper and the separate bedroom had a king sized bed. The bathroom was adequate and we had good water pressure in the shower even though we were on the 18th floor. The place was very clean and each day the suite was cleaned and made up by early to mid afternoon. No matter what hotel you stay at in downtown Chicago, everybody always complains about how much it costs to park your car. Yes, the going rate is usually $42 to $50+ per night but you kind of just have to accept that fact...unless you can snag the Homewood Suites deal that includes parking for $10! When you check the rates for the various rooms, make sure to look for the $10 parking suite deals. It truly is just $10 for parking over the price of the room. I think we paid $149.00 per night and that included parking, breakfast (full buffet, not just rolls and cereal), and Thanksgiving dinner! If you have ever stayed in downtown Chicago you know that is a great deal. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and always greeted you upon entering or leaving. The food staff were equally helpful and were always checking to make sure we had everything we needed from the buffet. As with any of the hotels during busy times, the wait for the elevator can get a little long, but that really only happened once or twice and the wait was much less that at the really big high-rise hotels on the Mag Mile. The location is great and only blocks away from Michigan Ave and a short walk to State Street and the Loop area. We recommended this place to friends and they were not disappointed.

So why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! We decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. It turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children.

Good breakfast and, on week days, complementary dinner snakes. 6. \"Pizza Uno\", by far the best pizza we ever ate (and we've been to Italy....) is just around the corner.

It's a busy place but they are very relaxed, something I have not noticed in other hotels. A lot of people have alluded to how \"busy\" the hotel is with families. We were there in late September and the hotel was full, but the it was noisy or full of kids. Mostly an adult population at this time of year.

Nice room with a kitchenette, two televisions (one in the bedroom, other in the living room), free wifi, and a very nice bathroom. The only thing that was not newlyl renovated in the room was the bathroom tile, which looked a little tired, but was completely fine. Everything else was new and tastefully done. As for parking...I parked at the open-air lot one short block away (corner of Rush and Illinois). It's very convenient to the hotel and costs $35 per 24 hours. Warning: If you are late to claim your car, the first 1/2 hour (after 24 hrs) costs $10...so make sure you note the time you left car (on the ticket) and make sure you pay at the kiosk before your 24 hours is up. I got there 10 minutes \"late\" and paid an extra $10 for those 10 minutes!

The price was right for a great location and suite style hotel. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from Nordstrom's, two blocks from a red line El-station and Michigan Ave, and a straight mile from Navy Pier. The hotel staff was all very friendly. The \"Suite Start\" breakfast was very crowded both mornings we ate there, but there was a wide selection of the usual hotel breakfast foods, both hot and cold. The breakfast staff was courteous and quickly took away dirty dishes to turn the tables. There was always hot coffee available in the lobby, which we found more convenient than brewing a small pot in our room. Our room was a standard 1-Bedroom King Homewood Suites room (I think I stayed in one in Baltimore that looked very similar). It wasn't large, but it was functional and comfortable. The downside of our stay there were the elevators. There are only two elevators to service a 30-story building. The lobby is on the sixth floor so you can't do or go anywhere without riding in an elevator, which would have been fine if both of them were working. One of the elevators was down most of the time we were there though. We had to wait at the street level entrance, in a long line of other guests, for almost a \u00c2\u00bd hour one day before we could get on an elevator. I felt like the bellmen could have offered to let guests ride on the service elevator, but they didn't. Then instead of waiting for the elevator to go up to the pool we decided to take the stairs. The stairwell was filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. The pool is a little goofy too. It is like a big stainless steel tub. There are no stairs to get in, just ladders, so there is really no good place for little kids to play.

It is all relative. Being in the room right near the pool on the top floor was not a terribly pleasing experience, as I was constantly subjected to the yells and cries of children consumed with delight as they charged to the pool with their parents; these joyful children and their parents could be heard clearly and explicitly from the hallway. Yes, it occurred to me early on to change my room; however, given the arduous experience that checking in was (and I heard the front desk repeatedly explain to other guests that there were no other rooms available), I decided to just stay in the room. Some reasons why include that the room was clean. The bed was quite comfortable. The room itself and its view were pleasing. Then again I was not in Chicago to admire the Trump Tower from my hotel window. Again, it's all relative. Now, let's talk about the piece that was most unpleasing--the check in. I admit to having gotten there early (around 11:30 a.m.), but \"my room\" was, according to the front desk, not yet available and would not be guaranteed until 4 p.m., but I was offered to drop my luggage off with the bellmen and to call back around 2 p.m. to check if my room was available. So, off we went to wander about the city, which was fine, but not ideal since I had hoped to get in before 1 p.m. to get settled before taking the 3 p.m. architectural boat tour, for which I had already bought tickets. I do realize though that the rules are the rules and that the fine print does say that rooms are guaranteed until 4 p.m. As anside, I was told that upon my return I would be able to pick up my luggage from the bellmen and that they would have the keys to my room (I had already done the paperwork during my initial attempt to check in). Well, it didn't quite transpire as promised. Upon our return, we were directed to go back to the front desk to get our keys (the long was extremely long and occupied with some unhappy campers who evidently were encountering some problems. In all fairness, it was Labor Day weekend and quite busy). On a positive note, the bellmen did bring our luggage up to our room and everything was intact. The bellmen were always friendly, the front desk staff not terribly so. At any rate, the breakfast was fine. The location of the hotel was outstanding. It is a fine place for families given the suite model. Was the experience bad? No, maybe if I had had another room away from children stampeding towards the pool, I would have had a different impression. But I can't know that.

My king sized bed suite became my home for the 6 nights. I loved having the kitchen with a coffee maker, burners, toaster, full size fridge and freezer, full size microwave, plus a living room, along with the bedroom and nice bathroom. I was on the 19th floor at the end of a hall in the corner and my suite was very, very quiet. The view of the city was really beautiful, especially at night. Even though I was on the same floor as the gym and the pool, I was on the other end and the only thing I ever heard was the occasional comings and goings of the people in the one suite across the hall from me, and that was only if I was in my kitchen or living room - the bedroom was totally insulated from any hallway or other side of the wall noise. The hotel was loaded with families, but my suite still was quiet and private - it felt more like an apartment than a hotel. The breakfasts were wonderful - I mostly enjoyed the yogurts, breads and fresh fruits (twice there were huge fresh blackberries, along with daily blueberries, melon, pineapple, apples, bananas), but there were also hot choices, cereals etc. as well. I chose to take my food up to my suite each morning, but seating was mostly not a problem. The \"welcome home\" meals were mostly geared towards families and kids, but you can't beat the free wine and beer! I also took that up to my room. It is all you can eat and drink and they are happy to provide as many take-out containers as requested. The maid service was also excellent - I never saw them, but each day I came back from sightseeing to the usual made bed and cleaned bathroom, along with kitchen dishes washed in the dishwasher, kitchen garbage taken out and all kitchen counters wiped. There is a Trader Joe's about 2 blocks away, so I kept a small supply of snacks and seltzer in the fridge and cabinets.

Fortunately they had take out containers which we would fill and take up to our room. We took advantage of the evening reception only once, but it was wonderful. They served pulled barbecue pork sandwiches with green beans. The menu posted on our refrigerator listed other quite substantial meals. On Monday through Thursday one could easily dine at the hotel. However, when you are in Chicago with all of those good restaurants within easy walking distance . . . . Some restaurants that weren't too far from the hotel that have been our favorites include, Star of Siam, Giordanos, Ed Deboviks. Shopping is also quite close as is an el station. They have a wonderful fitness center. You can work out on an elliptical machine, a treadmill, a bicycle or with weights while looking from the sixteenth floor onto the Chicago skyline. The pool is located next to the fitness center. The staff was always extremely friendly, welcoming us back each time we returned to the hotel. The only difficulty we had was when we made reservations. My husband called when he saw some great rates but was reluctant to prepurchase the package until we had finalized our plans.

The sofabed was acceptable - noticeably not as comfy as the bed, but passable. The rooms were well cleaned each day and the housekeeping staff was not pushy about getting in on their schedule. While the room comes equipped with a small kitchen, most times we found ourselves going out or enjoying the food downstairs. The breakfast changes daily and has plenty of excellent selections. Monday - Thursday, there is a manager's reception that includes a full meal. This isn't quite at the same standards as breakfast, but was still good. There is a 24-hour snack and sundry shop next to the reception desk. Trader Joe's grocery is also just two blocks north on Ontario. The kids wanted a pool, and they have one on the top floor that was open until 11pm. No problems with hygiene there and no overwhelming chlorine smell either. The pool deck has brilliant views of the city. The exercise room has a bike, elliptical, and treadmill, plus one upper body machine and some hand weights. The hotel is a short block and a half from Michigan Ave which has all the trendy shops, including an Apple store. My family had no problem walking up to the Water Tower Place (a high rise mall) or walking back with their packages.

We also highly recommend the boat tour \"River and Lake\" which includes going through the Lock from the river into Lake Michigan.

Went to Northbridge Mall across the street and came back 45 minutes later and our room was ready! The front desk called right away to confirm that we wanted a pack 'n play and apologized it wasn't there and one was brought up right away. I didn't even have to call first! The first night I hadn't had a chance to get milk for my 2-year-old's bottle so I called down to the front desk to see if they sold it in the little convenience store. I was encouraged to come down to the kitchen and they'd provide me with some pints for her bottle free of charge- so sweet! :) Same thing with ice when we went to check out- our ice maker hadn't been working and we never realized it b/c we didn't use it the whole time we were there. One call to the front desk for ice and a huge bag of it was brought up right away to our door. Service was outstanding. Maid service was also top notch- each day our room was perfectly clean, beds made and bathroom spotless. Much appreciated with 2 little ones everywhere all over the room.

When we got there I realized that it was not the room type I had booked and called the front desk to switch rooms. They didn't have one available yet so we decided to go have lunch and walk around a bit. My husband realized that he had left our pack of bottled Pepsi's in the fridge in the room. We got back to the hotel and picked up the keys to the new room, all of our luggage was neatly laid out by the bell guys. After we checked out the room and oohed and ahhed over the space, large kitchen, views, etc. we decided to go to the beach. When we returned the pepsi's that we had left in the other room were in our fridge, I would definitely consider that taking care of the small details! That really impressed us. Connie, the breakfast waitress was fabulous, greeting us every morning as we walked in for the wonderful breakfast buffet. We also had the opportunity to talk to Vanessa who was making rounds at the dinner tables ensuring that everyone was having a great stay. She made sure to ask the kids their favorite parts of the city and she was very easy to talk to. The front desk staff was extremely helpful throughout our trip whenever we had questions about which buses to take, the best route to get somewhere, and they were able to accomodate us when we asked for a late checkout. My husband cannot stop talking about the valet guys! He LOVED them! Everyday after I went to work, he and the girls would head out to see the city and apparently they made very good friends with the valets. They were greeted every morning, afternoon and evening when going in and out of the hotel. They were also extremely helpful with directions and suggestions. One night we were heading to Navy Pier and were planning on taking the bus, but the valet guy stopped us and told us about the free trolley stop right next to the hotel that went to Navy Pier. They just felt like family. The maid service was also fantastic, and they did all of our dishes and re-made the sofabed every day when they came to clean the room. I just was amazed that they did the dishes for us. The breakfast was very good and fulfilling, each day consisting of some kind of eggs and meat (sausage, bacon), and always oatmeal, bagels, toast, fruit and yogurt. There was also an endless supply of different types of coffee and usually you could find some flavored creamers stashed in the creamer bin... a nice touch. The dinner was also completely adequate, each day featuring a different theme such as Mexican, Italian, Deli, etc. along with the complimentary beer and wine (but I'm not much of a drinker). The pool on the 19th floor was very nice with 180 degrees of city views out of floor to ceiling windows. There were also restrooms at the pool that included showers which seemed very convenient, and a towel rack full of towels so you didn't have to worry about using the towels from your room. I just can't stress enough how wonderful our stay was. We have never been taken such good care of anywhere we have ever stayed.

The only negatives I had about the hotel had to do with our bathroom. There is no entrance from the main space so I had to walk through the bedroom where my son was sleeping to get to the bathroom. The tub didn't drain well, the light flickered and the tub needs those safety traction stickers on the bottom. My child slipped in the shower.

All service was extremely friendly and accomodating, our room was nice and roomy (separate area for the living room/kitchen and bedroom/bathroom) and had a spectacular view of the city!

The bell/valet staff is super-friendly and helpful, even though they're seemingly always busy! Our biggest concern with this hotel is the lack of elevators. There are only two public elevators and during peak periods the wait can get a bit long (though it always seems like forever it's probably only minutes). This is a very minor point but when you're waiting with an impatient toddler it can seem like forever. :-) Additionally, our room was warm but we were told that the AC couldn't be turned on because the overall hotel either provides heat or cool but not both and the outside air temp was less than the cut-off for AC (and yes, we had Engineering come to look at our room's HVAC unit). Luckily, they flipped the building-wide switch to allow us to turn on the AC before it got really hot outside, but it was noticeably cooler in the halls and a bit uncomfortable for sleeping before that. I might recommend changing that policy to allow people to turn AC on sooner... the rooms heat up quickly and accumulate heat from floors below. Our recent stay was on the 12th floor and our room was showing a few signs of age/heavy use with the carpet being a bit worn and frayed, so it might be getting near time to refresh some bits. The cleaning staff is great and the room looked and felt clean. We will definitely stay here again.

Cons: 1) Timing of housekeeping staff 2) Temperature controls in room 3) Room could use a bit of TLC; peeling wallpaper, etc. 4) Pack N' Play was promised but not delivered 5) Valet parking $42./day with in-out privileges, but we literally never got the car out while we were were; there should be a lower price if you don't intend to use your car ** We have visited Chicago 5-6 times prior to this trip. This was the first trip with our two boys (ages almost 4, and almost 1). The hotel was perfect for them. They boys slept in the main room, in the pull-out couch and our Pack N' Play (we reserved one with the hotel, and the front desk person at check-in indicated it was or would be in the room, but it wasn't there; we had brought our own from home, because I kind of figured there would be a problem with this). The location was absolutely perfect for walking to most attractions, including Millenium Park, Navy Pier, shopping on Michigan Ave., etc. We took the #146 bus to Shedd Aquarium with ease. The pool is more than sufficient for splashing about with the boys. Not too big, but big enough. At its busiest, there were maybe 10-12 people in the pool, and it wasn't bad as everyone was courteous. If there had been more people, and/or the ones in the pool had been unruly, it would have been bad. But it wasn't. it was great! The breakfast was a very nice addition, allowed us to save time and money by eating at the hotel before venturing out each day. Plenty of seating, high chairs, variety of foods for both parents and adults, etc. ** When we arrived at check-in, the room was very warm, which was a surprise, as it was only about 50 degrees outside on May 27th. Jonah with Bell services noticed the temperature, checked the vent and indicated that they had had to switch back and forth between heat and AC because of the big temperature fluctuations. We tried a variety of combinations, between opening the windows, turning the AC on and off, etc., but couldn't get the temp quite right. Also, it was strange to me that the AC control was in the main room, and we'd have to \"sneak\" in there in the evening from the master bedroom, trying to adjust the controls while not waking up our kids. The issue with the portable crib wasn't a big deal, and I'm sure they'd have brought one if we'd reminded them, but since I specifically called to add same to our reservation, and then at check-in the staff reiterated that one would be in the room and wasn't, that was kind of annoying. We stayed 3 nights. On the first full day, after the first night, we returned from a day of sightseeing about 3:15pm and the room hadn't been cleaned. Not a big deal, but we put the kids down for a nap and about 4 housekeeping came knocking. We got fresh towels and asked if they could come back later, and that wasn't an option. The following full day, they came and cleaned between about 4:45-5:30pm, which I thought was pretty late, but it is a big hotel. Also not a huge deal, just struck me as a bit unusual. The room was cleaned very well when it was cleaned. The room itself was overall nice. Some peeling wallpaper and cracks. Just a bit unsightly, nothing more. The bedding was nice. The kitchen is well-appointed with some cookware, place settings for 4, etc. Enough that if you were inclined to save money by cooking some lunches and/or dinners, you certainly could do so. We even had a garbage disposal and dishwasher, along with two-burner stove, microwave and full-size refrigerator with freezer. ** Overall, we would definitely return, mainly because of the location, 2-room kid-friendly suites, friendly customer service, and free breakfast.

We paid $199 per night for the first 5 nights, and $279 for the last 2 nights. By my calculations we still saved money (there are hotels that sleep 5 to a room for less per night) because of the buffet breakfast every morning and the evening buffet Mon thru Thurs. Breakfasts had scrambled cheesy eggs every day, and some mornings included french toast & bacon, or potatoes, biscuits & gravy. There were always two or three kinds of fruit, oatmeal packets, 3 cereals including fruit loops, breads like bagels or muffins, yogurt, cottage cheese, juices, tea, coffee. The weekday M-Th dinners included a main dish like meatballs, hotdogs, brisket, or baked potato with toppings. Sides varied with combos of mac n cheese, soup, chips and salsa, macaroni salad, potato salad, green salad, green beans, broccoli, mashed potatoes, and more. I thought the weekday meal would be minimal, but it included so many choices and you could return and get more from the nicely organized buffet. Evening beverages included serve yourself wine carafes and beer. At busy times, you wait at the entry and a staff person seats you. At other times, you seat yourself. We only had to wait for a table once and only for a few minutes. It is a large carpeted room with nice, substantial upholstered chairs and plenty of tables that seat 2-6. Let me tell you, with 5 of us, even with 3 of us on the small side (me, plus my youngest who are 7th grade twin boys) every meal at a restaurant was about $100, so these meals saved us a lot. Our room faced the back, looking over roofs, but with views of skyscrapers beyond. We had no problem with too much traffic noise, even with open windows - so glad for the fresh air. There is always a bit of noise in a huge city - to be expected. The bedroom had a window, two double beds, a tv set on a chest of drawers, a full size closet, and a wide-counter sink with mirror and the entry to the super spacious bathroom. The living area, separated from the bedroom with a door you could close, had another window and another flat screen tv, a double-size sleeper sofa and upholstered chair, a small table with two wood chairs, and a kitchen stocked with 4 serving sets (haha! good thing all 5 of us didn't eat all at once). It was great to bring back leftovers from our restaurant meals, store them in the fridge, and buy extra groceries, and eat them for lunch or our Friday night dinner before departing the next day. More savings! Coffee and tea are provided with a coffee maker in the room, too. Pros: LOCATION! Set just 2 blocks from the red line which we rode multiple times each day, and Michigan Ave. with its bus lines and things to do. Close by is also Pizzeria Uno and Big Bowl thai/chinese and Weber Grill and we enjoyed all these restaurants. SERVICE and CLEANLINESS: The staff are wonderful, friendly, and the room, lobby, buffet, pool, were always so clean. POOL - my kids swam twice and said the water could be just a tad warmer, but the warmth of the room helped. Cons: The sofa sleeper mattress was thin and felt wiry. And, there was a door to the next room, so someone could have adjoining rooms. It was safely bolted, however we could easily hear all the neighbors' voices which was a little distracting. We would be watching tv and it sounded like we had guests. I couldn't always hear the actual words they were saying, and thankfully this only happened 2 of the nights so either just those people were louder or the other 5 nights the room was empty. Also, thankfully, all was quiet after 10pm. And, there is no fan in the bathroom. The room's spaciousness meant the good distance from the bathroom door to the bed, where someone might be reading or watching tv, helped, but we made sure to have the tv on if someone was *ahem* using the bathroom, in order to minimize embarrassment. We used two laptops with the free wireless connection. It was slower in the evening when I suppose so many guests were online at once. One of our computers performed better than the other with the connection. The business center, with free printing of our boarding passes, was great.

April 9 2011 We were able to secure a great AAA rate.(135) Location is perfect. We flew into Midway and took public transportation into downtown. Very easy and cheap. Checked in early as we had e-checked in the night before. Picked a corner room away from the elevators. The first few days we were in the hotel it was sold out and there were quite a few families with young children. It wasn't a problem for us. Any over flow was taken care of quickly at breakfast and elevator waits were minimal due to management allowing folks to use the freight elevator. As for previous posters who bemoaned the \"running out of food\", the only thing that ran out during our visit was the waffle mix on Wed. (Waffles are every other day) Guests seem to think it's ok for each of their children (regardless of the age) to make a waffle and then eat a bite and not eat the rest. The waste was amazing. We saw people take BOWLS of sausage. This is certainly not managements fault. Later in the week there were sport teams in the hotel and nothing ran out. I noticed people coming down after breakfast hours and still being allowed to sit and eat and everyone was gracious about it. For a tourist the location is great. We were close to the red line and numerous bus lines, and walking distance to many, many sights. And with a teenage daughter how perfect to hit the stores each evening. We didn't walk a lot as the weather was gloomy and got to know public transportation quite well. The front desk folks were able to get us to the correct buses, find me enjoyable jogging paths, and direct us to short cuts over to Michigan Ave. The employees were fantastic. I have to say EVERYONE we encountered in Chicago was so pleasant, and helpful. Kudo's to the City of Chicago. The evening snacks vary and can be dinner depending on your likes. We didn't have \"dinner\" but did stop in one night and had some food before we headed out to the Art Museum. Our room was clean, clean, clean. We had a problem with one TV and it was fixed within hours. The housekeeping staff were pleasant and after asking just once for extra conditioner (a couple of long hair girls) they always provided a few extra each day. The only thing missing for us was an in room safe. We travel often with a lap top and would have to deal with it. The wireless was strong and complimentary. The workout room had just 3 pieces of equipment but only one or 2 folks were using it at any given time. The pool was quite busy but no noise traveled out of the pool area. Would I recommend this hotel. YES ( well if you are a couple you might want to find another hotel with breakfast if you are trying to \"get away\" from your own kids.) But even with all the families it was not a mad house in any capacity. The kids were very well behaved and having a great time.

We still are returning to this fantastic hotel and recommending it to our friends for many reasons. 1. Location: Right off the Mag Mile, short walk to Watertower Place, 1 mi straight down Grand to Navy Pier, short walk to the theater district. This time we took the 151 bus from in front of the Amtrak station at Union Station right to Ohio & Mich Ave (2 short blocks from the hotel). We also took the Red line 1 block from the hotel right to Wrigley Field. (Addison stops 1 block from the stadium) There is a large Jewel/Osco store 1 block away. You are in the middle of many wonderful restaurants and 1 block from the ESPN Zone. 2. Value: Beautiful, full breakfast every morning with long hours. We were served several types of fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, coffee/teas, milk, juices, breakfast meat, scrambled eggs, 2 kinds of potates, and waffles or french toast. Great variety and quality of food. On Sun-Thurs nights they serve a buffet dinner where we found plenty to fill us up. The main dishes for the 3 nights we stayed were, stuffed green peppers, beef pepper steak, and chicken cacciatore. The sides were a soup, bread, a hot vegetable, 3 salads, and rice or pasta. Drinks were ice tea, water, lemonade, beer and wine. The desserts were cake, cookies and brownies (1 dessert/night). There were hot drinks available all day long which were a big help since Chicago was showing her rainy and cold side during our visit. 3. Rooms: We stayed in the King suite with a pull-out couch, 2 flat-screened TV's, full kitchen and large bath. Very nice sitting area. In the past we have stayed in the larger rooms with 2 beds with a pull-out couch. We have also made use of the cots they have available. The bedding was very nice on the King and the bed extremely comfortable. All this makes the Homewood Suites very comfortable for those of us traveling with kids. Our room was very quiet and was ready for us even though we arrived shortly after noon. 4. Staff: Very friendly, helpful desk personnel who made an effort to have our rooms next to each other without us asking. Doormen were very personable and welcoming. The maids also went out of their way to help us with small issues that arose. The dining personnel were particularly helpful and attentive. Everyone had a smile and made us feel welcome. 5. Pool: One of the few hotels in Chicago with a pool and this one is on the top floor with magnificent views of the city. Those with kids know the importance of having a pool. 6. Business Center: We did not bring a computer, so having 3 computers with a printer for our use 24 hours a day helped us keep in contact with work and friends while away. We also were able to use them for travel plans and maps since we don't have a smart phone. There is free internet (wired and wireless) access throughout the hotel and rooms. We visit Chicago regularly and have stayed at several of the hotels, but we still return to the Homewood Suites for all of the above reasons.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cTwo for two, even more outstanding the second time\u201d", "Author": "hamptondragon", "ReviewID": "UR104432204", "Content": "Stayed here once last year for a meeting and since it is family friendly I brought mine with me. Liked it so much that we came back for a leisure visit during spring break. As with all Homewood Suites, the free dinner M-Th and free breakfast each day saved a lot of $$. The parking fee is a downer, but such is life in downtown Chicago (too bad they can't waive it for reward stays, wish they would). We were on the 19th floor and had a great downtown view. The food is good and priced right, the suite was clean, spacious, and the hotel is very family friendly. I LOVE the fact they let one take extra food back to one's room, even have containers with which to do so. Some hotels whine about taking extra food away (may feel it drives up costs) but that is one thing that gets our business--we can take some food and eat it for lunch later in the day at one of the many sites in Chicago, which is exactly what we did. Business center is OK (though had an issue with reading one of the programs I needed), fitness center is great (and for the workout gurus one gets free access to the Conrad fitness center across the street which is even better). The pool is very nice, esp being on the top floor. With such a large hotel it is crowded every night, but that is OK. My young kids liked playing with the other young kids in the pool. The staff are friendly. The walls are thick and guests don't disturb each other even if some guests are loud. Couple of minor issues--there is no hot tub, that is a bummer. Rooms do not have direct thermostats, only temperature regulators where one can only set a few values. It was March in Chicago (i.e. still cold) but our room was so hot that we still had to open the windows to cool off. That worked OK, but at other times in the year that could be an issue. Elevators (only two of them for 14 floors including the ground floor) can be a bit of a wait, but not usually too bad. These are minor issues.

It was also nice to have a kitchenette in the suite although we really didn't need it because there are two many great places to eat in Chicago. One deciding factor for us was the hot breakfast served every morning adjacent to the lobby. It was very nice with a good selection of food, not just your basic continental breakfast. They also have a hot dinner on Monday - Thursday but it didn't impress us. Hard to stay in for dinner though as I mentioned earlier. The pool on the top floor was nice and it had a great view of the city. I also used the work out facility each morning, its small but functional if there's not more than 3 people working out.

The location is close to everything on North Michigan (it's right across from Nordstrom's) and the Art Institute and Millenium Park are walkable in good weather. And now for the tale of what made this hotel truly outstanding. My room was right across from the elevator, so after shopping and before meeting everyone else for lunch, I rushed back to the hotel to drop off two shopping bags. I got off the elevator and the door to my room was open for housekeeping, so I reached in and put the bags on the table, telling the housekeeper,\"I'm just going to drop these off.\" Then I left to join my friends for lunch. When we all returned to our rooms, the bags were missing. The manager was immediately responsive and within only a few minutes he had begun an in-house investigation, offered to make right all losses, and had talked with the head of housekeeping, the housekeeper for our room, and all of us. This was done in the most positive, professional, and pleasant way and we all felt as if--whatever the outcome--things were going to be ok. And they were. Because I had started talking to a fellow elevator passenger, ridden PAST my 11th floor room, and gotten off on the 19th floor. The room in which I left my shopping bags was indeed the room across from the elevator--just on the wrong floor. The housekeeper who had been cleaning the 19th floor room had turned in the bags and they were returned to me later in the day. Whew and oh, gosh, was I embarrassed. The calm positive reactions of everyone at the hotel and the quick supportive responses of everyone involved exhibited a level of professionalism and efficiency that can be hard to find.

When I woke up at 3am to use the bathroom I could hear the elevators outside and I could actually hear the person above me relieving himself. Awkward. I would suggest requesting a room away from the elevators. The building was obviously dated, judging by the faucet and other fixtures in the bathroom being very loose and/or coming out of the wall and the style and condition of the furniture. It has central air, which was great, but if you're used to sleeping with a fan at night bring one with you. There is no in-room safe and no mini-bar. HOWEVER, the location was amazing. Right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. It was wonderful to go out to dinner and shopping then walk right back to our hotel. There was security at the door which made us feel good. Inside, the staff was so friendly. We were on the 11th floor and the view was amazing. The room had a separate living space/kitchen from the bedroom which was lovely and great for families. We didn't use the full kitchen, but plan to when we go back with our kids. There was a flat screen TV in each room and big, picture windows so we had a great view of the city. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The bedding was much MUCH softer than your average hotel bedding. I was impressed with that. The breakfast the next morning was very good, for hotel food.

Our room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and most importantly the suite was equipped with everything we needed for a weekend stay.

I could hardly hear any noise in the room besides an occasional siren (That is expected). Our suite had cups, plates and utensils ready for our use. The location of the hotel was also ideal.....we went shopping and out to dinner with a minimal walking time. For kids try the Rainforest cafe (2 blocks away). For the price, I do not think we could have found a better hotel if I spent 3 days looking. Another excellent feature was the breakfast. We saved a bunch of money eating at the hotel and the food was very good with many options. Finally, the staff.

It has a pool but no hot tub. There is an exercise room with 2 treadmills, weights, recumbent bike, and some sort of elliptical type thing. The pool is hit or miss on crowding. On Fri at 8PM there was no one there but us, but on Sun at 1030AM it was too crowded for my daughter to want to swim. On Sun at 1140AM it was empty. It goes from 3 feet to 4.5 feet. The room has a living room/kitchen with table seating for 2. There is a 2 burner stove, good size microwave, almost full size fridge, coffeemaker, and 2 slice toaster. There is a separate bedroom with king bed and a full bath off of that. I did notice some little imperfections (toilet paper holder slightly bent, luggage rack looks a little worn), but in general the room is clean and in good repair. There is a breakfast buffet (7-10 on weekends and 630-930 on weekdays). So far they have had eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, corned beef hash, grits, fruit, toast/bagels to toast, and tea/coffee/juice/milk. They have takeout containers so you can take breakfast back to the room. Tip for this, I brought down one of those plastic bags you get from the store and it was really helpful for carrying the food back. Usually I end up juggling the containers and drinks and everything in the elevator. The elevators were really crowded on Sun AM, but otherwise have not been bad. You enter on the 1st floor (there is valet parking which I think was about $40-50/day, but it was included in our room rate so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember exactly). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure there are in and out privileges, but we are not driving again until we check out. There are several restaurants within a block or so of the hotel, and Nordstroms is right across Grand Ave (the other entrance to the Nordstroms Mall is on Michigan Ave). We walked to Navy Pier and it took about 30 min or so (not rushing and running into the parade on Michigan making us have to backtrack). We took the bus up to Water Tower Place, but it was certainly walkable, we just felt like taking the bus. The staff has been pleasant. The guy who parked our car has called me by name every time we have come back to the hotel (just saying hi). In fact last night when we came in he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi Mrs X\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (using my last initial) which was a little disconcerting, but did not offend me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if that familiarity would offend others or not. There are a lot of families with kids staying here, but they have been generally well behaved and well supervised. Several times my daughter went to the pool and it was empty except for her, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen often in hotels we stay at. We did have a slight problem on checkout. On the receipt they put under the door for express checkout they charged me for parking, which was supposed to be included in my rate. However, when I took it down to the desk and told them they immediately changed it with no argument and apologized, so I certainly can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold it against them.

My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved the pool on the top floor which is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows and has a great view of the city, especially when swimming at night. The beds were very comfortable, the only negative was that I heard several sirens during the night that woke me once or twice, but hey, you are in downtown Chicago. The location was excellent. To get to Michigan ave we simply walked across the street to Nordstroms and cut through the North Bridge mall to bring us right out to Michigan Ave. You can also walk one block and take the steps up to Michigan ave as well. It was so easy to go back and forth and do what we wanted but go relax and get warm whenever we needed to. They had movies you could rent to watch on the living room TV. Pricey (most were $12.99) but all newer releases or some still in theaters. You could also rent games to play and the controllers are already connected to the television. There is a PF Chang Chinese restaurant across the street which we enjoyed for dinner that night, excellent food!!

We had requested a quiet room with a good view of the city, and Jennifer happily accommodated us. We were extremely happy with our beautiful view of the Wrigley Tower clock and the Trump Tower; day or night, the view was great! Our suite was very nice. It was clean and inviting. For a four-night stay, it was advantageous to have a sitting area with kitchen in addition to the bedroom. The kitchen was handy for storing and reheating leftovers from oversized restaurant meals. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom has the sink and closet area outside the tub and toilet area which is very convenient for two people preparing for the day at the same time. Other reviewers had mentioned how the hotel staff goes out of its way to take care of the guests. This is so true! Everyone, from the breakfast and front desk staff to the guy mopping the floor, were so friendly. Since we had a late afternoon departure flight, the hotel was happy to give us late check-out. We were able to go on a fabulous Wendella tour of the river and lake that morning without having to deal with our luggage. Our Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Monday stay provided us with 5 complimentary meals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dinner on Thursday and breakfast every morning. The meals provided variety and tasty nourishment, and they saved us both time and money. After hours of travel on Thursday, it was convenient to be able to enjoy the late afternoon exploring Michigan Avenue and then crash at the hotel with a good dinner. Each day got a good start with a hot, fresh breakfast before heading out to the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities. Different offerings were available each morning. The location was great! Since we are avid walkers, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go with the exception of the Museum of Science and Industry (we took the #10 weekend bus). Public transportation is not hard to figure out. I had gotten directions for using the train from Midway to the Roosevelt station and then transferring (free) to the Red Line subway to the Grand Avenue stop just 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks from the hotel. The CTA personnel at Midway was so helpful that he made sure to clarify our directions. We had a similar experience with CTA personnel at the Grand Ave. station for our return trip to the airport. The hotel business center has 3 computers which seems adequate. Only one evening did I have to wait for a computer to become available. The only problem I encountered for the entire stay was in printing our boarding passes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only one pc has the proper print alignment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the other 2 chop off the first letter on the left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might be important for getting through airport security. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the front desk would have assisted me with this problem, but another guest in the business center knew which pc would send the proper printing to the printer. The fitness room and swimming pool looked good, but we never used them. We tended to get all the activity we needed walking around the city all day. I did notice that other hotel guests used them.

I had a 5 day business meeting at a downtown Chicago hotel but this hotel was cheaper and I am an Hhonors gold member. Additionally, this hotel was the same price whether I brought my wife and kids or just myself so, as Chicago is within driving distance of where I live, this hotel got my business and my family got to come. Being family friendly was a huge plus. Also interesting to meet some patrons who had been staying in the hotel weeks or months. I agree with most of what has been said about this hotel. The staff are nice during the meals and at the front desk. My toddler doesn't like elevators (he got used to them during this 5+ night stay) and they saw him crying and they gave him a toy rubber duck with \"Chicago\" on it and a cubs hat on the duck. Nice touch that he liked. Apparently people don't look too closely at websites as all Homewood Suites (HWS) have free breakfast every morning and a free dinner M-H (some patrons are surprised by this). Yes, as with all downtown Chicago hotels parking is ridiculously overpriced but such is life in that location. This hotel has standard HWS amenities including the free meals, hot chocolate at night, DVD players in rooms and such. The lobby on the 1st floor and 6th floor are rather underwhelming as is the place where one drops off their car, but this is not an issue in my mind. I love the breakfast and the ability to take extra food upstairs and store it in the fridge, something Embassy Suites often won't let you do and should. Those with kids will understand the beauty in this. The views of downtown Chicago in the midst of the skyscrapers are excellent, as is the view from the pool. Loved it up there. The pool is OK, nice size but no real shallow area for kids about 2-3. For some reason, there was some sand that came out of the water jets in the pool, and that was odd. I think this HWS should have a hot tub, but oh well (i.e. there is no hot tub). The hotel insulation is very good as I couldn't hear noise in adjacent rooms and the loud downtown Chicago noise was nicely muted when the windows were closed. The bed is nice, liked the pillows and I found the hide-a-bed sofa comfortable. The hotel could use a shuttle as the trolley rarely runs after mid September but the hotel is near the red line of the L and is near some great downtown attractions and restaurants. The breakfast food is very good, although I think they should have waffles (or possibly french toast or pancakes) every morning. They seemed to like to serve biscuits and gravy at this hotel. Dinner is simple (great for kids) and there is a menu so you know what will be served each night. Fitness center is adequate, but one gets access to the better center at the nearby Conrad. As with any HWS, there is no onsite restaurant, but there is a snack shop and of course nearby places to eat at times when the hotel is not serving free meals. Internet is free and is of reasonable speed. Yes, there are only two elevators but I never waited more than 30 seconds. A few minor negatives. I asked for a top or near top floor, a few days in advance, and they didn't commit to one. Doubt it is that tough with notice to reserve a top floor room for a gold member, but such is life. I did get a 14th floor room and the pool is on the 19th floor. The pool area could use a hot tub. Figure out the sand issue with the pool. Have some fruit (like bananas or apples as most Hamptons and HWS do) or snacks out after 7:00 like more other HWS do (hot chocolate isn't quite enough). Bathroom is a bit small. However, these are minor. Overall, bigtime thumbs up and I hope to come back. I had a great time in Chicago, as did my family. Thank you HWS downtown Chicago.

The bathroom is huge, but the toilet and bathtub/shower are in one room and the sink is outside with the bedroom which can be a little noisy to use at night - especially when you are sharing.

Our interaction was mostly with the Concierge/bell men who were very charming, helpful and friendly in particular Amir. I applaude the hotel for recruiting such personnel. The Homewood Suites offers a breakfast daily and dinner from M-F. The breakfast and dinner were average as far as selection and taste, lacked creativity and flavour, but gracious enough from the hotel to offer for free. It helps a lot if you have kids with you and if you are traveling on a budget. I highly recommend gettng rid of the carnation plant, it gives the room a very cheap look, could very well be replacebale by something more modern.

I would agree wholeheartedly. Location is excellent. Included breakfast is excellent. The rooms are excellent - having the suite allows you to close the door and let the kids go to bed without having to sit in the dark. Full fridge, microwave dishwasher, sink, table so you can easily keep milk/food for the week or just get takeout and eat in the room when you can't face another night of waiting for a table with hungry kids. The valet/concierge staff was the best I've ever experienced. They were all extremely nice and helpful, it was the same crew every day so we felt comfortable with them and most importantly, they very friendly to kids. Especially a man named Adbul - he remembered our kids (4 and 6) every time we came in or out and joked around with them, which made them feel very special. Room was clean and well maintained. To be honest and objective, the first day we were there there was a hair on one of the towels which freaked my wife out, but I didn't think it was a huge deal and it didn't happen again. We had to call for extra towels every night instead of them just leaving them for us when they cleaned the room, but they always brought them up right away. But these are minor points - overall excellent. The pool is on the 19th floor with big windows with city view. The kids were excited but with the sunshine it felt like a sauna so we didn't spend time there. But it was as nice as any hotel pool I've seen. Read the comments about the fact that they only have 2 elevators which caused some people delays, but I have to say we didn't experience that at all - the elevators always came right away even during peak times. Shuttle to Navy Pier drops you off right in front of the hotel. We walked into Phil Stefani's Italian restaurant around the corner and while it was a higher end restaurant, they welcomed us with our kids in our shorts and we had a great meal. The hotel is right across from a hotel with great shopping. Highly recommend the Lego Store. We went to the Legoland play center in Schaumburg the next day (highly recommend) and you can buy tickets at the store in the mall for a great discount. Saved us $28.

We checked out the downtown area and visited Millennium Park, the Art Museaum, and many other places. The bellhops were always a great place to get information about the popular bars and hang-out places in the area. This area is also very close to public transportation should you need to go a bit further than walking distance. The rooms were nice. Although you could tell that not everything was brand new, it was all in very good shape. The beds were super comfy and the suite we stayed in had a full kitchenette including microwave, fridge with freezer, some cooking utensils, etc. There was a tv in the bedroom and one in the living room type area off the kitchenette. The bathroom did not have much in the way of counter space, but it was fine and served it's purpose. The view from our particular room was not the greatest, but that was okay as we had other options for taking in the view of the city skyline by visiting the pool on the upper level or just off of the lobby during breakfast and happy hour times. They also have a checklist on the fridge where you can have the staff pick up a few items from the market for you that they bring to your room. I believe there is a small fee for this, but am not positive as we did not use this service. The beautiful pool was located on the 19th floor and afforded a fantastic view of the skyline, especially at night. There was usually nobody or just a few people in the pool when we visited and it was nice and relaxing - very clean and well maintained. There was also a small fitness center right off of this that we did not get the chance to use. This hotel serves a full buffet style breakfast that was positively delicous with something for everyone's taste. They also serve a happy hour \"snack\" and drinks during the week, which was more of a meal than a snack with unlimited wine and beer in addition to the \"snack.\" There was more than enough included with this to count as a full meal. We stayed for happy hour twice and could not believe the set-up they provided (see pics). There is also a business center that I had used to map out some places for us to visit while here and a small gift shop type of area that had a few misc. items for sale.

It was clean, comfortable, accommodating, had a 2 room plus kitchen feature, fold-down couch, a great complementary breakfast, good value, the perfect location a block down from the train access and across from Nordstroms, near great restaurants like Rock Bottom, Joe's for crab, Cosis for casual lunch, the Weber Grill for steak and burger dinner, Quortinos for wedding dinner, Buccas on cattycorner for Italian dinner, (most of these were within a block) and Starbucks for morning coffee which was 2 1/2 blocks away, although the hotel supplied it for free in the lobby all day. Heather, the manager, was so warm and welcoming. The bellman located a 30 passenger kind of private bus for our family to do a 90 minute tour of Chicago and take us to the waterfront for a family picture and on to my brother's apartment. Connie, in the breakfast room, greeted me every morning with a big smile and even noticed when I was away a day. The food was plentiful, tasty, replenished quickly and our dishes cleared away. Outstanding service--I've worked in a restaurant so was impressed with how the buffet was managed. Enjoyed the casual sandwich dinner available the first night we were there. The bed was so comfortable, with great pillows. The maids were great, and worked with our schedules and needs. There was an equally comfortable lobby area where we could sit, chat and congregate as a family. Loved the kitchen feature in the rooms. Homewood Suites totally exceeded my expectations--it's not luxury, but it's all you need and actually had features that were more important to us than poshness and glitz such as location, accessibility, the breakfast, friendliness of staff, welcoming comfort and affordability so you have money for activities and fit different families budgets. Our family likes mass transit--by taking the train which was one block away to O'Hare we avoided all the O'Hare traffic and the train fare was $2.25 a person compared to $15-20 per person on a shuttle. We figured the train was quicker than taxi/shuttle as the traffic was slowed up due to the holiday weekend and our train was moving faster than the traffic when we passed it. All of my siblings were pleased with Homewood Suites as well.

We arrived at early at 2:00, but our 1-bedroom king suite on the 17th floor was ready. The room itself was quite nice and very clean. There was a small kitchen, work table, living area with couch and flat-screen TV, a tiny separate bedroom with king bed, and a small bathroom adjacent to the bedroom with a vanity separate from the WC. We had a nice view of the Trump Building and were able to see a sliver of the river between other buildings. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was very quiet. Free WiFi! A daily buffet breakfast was included in the rate. I think it is a bit better than Hampton Inn, and has the standards including a few hot items, juice, coffee, nicely cut fresh melon, cereals, and pastries. All in all, this hotel is very respectable and a great value. Good service. At $259/night, it was among the least expensive of the convention hotels, despite being an excellent 3* property in a good location.

I chose to stay here (and not at the conference hotel which is a 10 minute walk) because my family and I have stayed here before and had a great experience.

We just spent a week in Chicago for a vacation travelling with two kids, one of whom is just a toddler. This hotel met our needs perfectly as it is in a very central location: Just a block from the metro Red Line and a few blocks (cutting through the mall across the street) to the Magnificent Mile and all the bus lines available. We avoided the $42/day valet fee and just used those funds and the car rental funds to pay for our airport shuttle and transit passes. We came out well ahead that way. This hotel also comes with a microwave, stovetop, toaster and full refrigerator. It also comes with a daily breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage/bacon, cut and whole fruits, bagels, etc. And on Monday through Thursday they provide what they call a light meal from 5pm-7pm. This was something simple like make your own fajitas one night or pasta marinara another night. As another reviewer commented, it is free and if you don't care for it, simply head out and get something else. The hotel is literally within a block of multiple restaurants including PF Changs, Buca di Beppo, ESPN Sports Zone, Pizzeria Uno, a food court in the Nordstrom mall across the street (which oddly seemed to shut down around 6pm) and a bunch of fairly high end looking steak houses and other restaurants. If you want to use the kitchen facilities in the room there was an Osco Jewel affiliated full grocery store a block and a half away to the west. The staff was extremely helpful. They front desk staff were always extremely helpful and took note that we were a family and catered their advice to us based on this. I was surprised when I mentioned food allergy concerns and they whipped out a list of restaurants in the area that would be preferred. They also gave us great tips on using public transportation in the area and simply navigating Downtown. The hotel itself is a bit old but seemed to fit in to the area as Chicago is an old city. There were some quirks about the room such as the dishwasher not draining fully or the doors to the bedroom being a little off center but nothing we could not live with. Interestingly, the hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the rooms continue all the way up to the 19th floor. We never figured out what occupied floors 1-5. The 19th floor also housed the swimming pool and small fitness center. The swimming pool had a fairly panoramic view of the northwest and southwest ends of the hotel. We intentionally chose a corner room on the opposite end (southeast corner) which had views of the Trump Tower and Hancock Building. There are many other tall buildings in Downtown so do not expect a great skyline view but it was still great for the kids to look our at day or night.

In addition, the staff is very, very friendly and seems to keep up with the guests needs. Here are the drawbacks we found traveling with three of our children, 1) the lobby is almost non-existant so you are confined to your room when in the hotel, which is a small hotel. 2) Possibly because it was spring break for some, the hotel was crowded with families and small children. This makes breakfast troublesome and the elevators very slow and packed with strollers. 3) The food is kid-friendly but not what adults might like (frozen pizza) and the breakfast is the same everyday. There is box wine and draft beer for happy hour. On day three, we couldn't eat another scrambled egg with cheese or danish from a box. The cereal was all stale everyday and seemed to be a value brand of frosted flakes, froot loops. 4) The rooms are not as spacious as they appear online. They do have a nice set up with the kitchen but most of it seems like overkill. A dishwasher... there are only four plates in the cupboard so who needs to run an entire dishwasher? 5) It's just not a tall enough hotel to have a good view from windows. We were told we would have a lovely view of the tribune building but we just saw a parking garage out the window. Normally, not an issue but there is nowhere else to go in the hotel to hang out. We have stayed at the embassy suites in dwntn. Chicago and the hotel is much nicer in terms of space and breakfast. If this hotel had great rates, it would be worth it. But in my opinion, if you take the time to get away with your family, other hotels in Chicago have a much nicer appeal for about the same money. In all, this hotel screams value from the interior so if the rates are a value too and you are looking to save some money on a clean room, go for it. But if you like something comparable to a Marriott, Westin, or even one of the finer Chicago hotels, you will not like this choice.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "CrissyB", "ReviewID": "UR61085130", "Content": "We visited the Homewood Suites for a three day weekend trip to Chicago.

The room worked out perfect. Was a little tight to fit all our many baby related items but was just what we were looking for with accomodations. The daily breakfast provided was an added bonus which we thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel location was great. Centrally located in the downtown area. Easy to walk to surrounding areas as well as easily accessible to buses, taxis, subway, whatever means of travel you want. :) The main reason I felt it necessary to provide a review of the hotel was the staff. They were just fabulous! So friendly, helpful and thoughful. The bellmen staff was particulary wonderful, always welcoming us back, asking how our day was and providing assistance when needed. The front desk staff was also very helpful answering questions.

The breakfast buffet was what you would expect , with enough variety for people to find something to start their day off with! I have read from people that they weren't overly impressed with the evening buffet, and though It wasn't the best selling point of the hotel, I definately wouldnt rate the hotel lower for this reason as to be honest, the fact that it is even offered in the first place is an added bonus as I have never been to a hotel before that offers this! It is one of those things that is there - if you like it, then that's great, but if you dont, then you go elsewhere for dinner and you're not really at a loss as you wouldn't have it at any thoer hotel anyway - so no loss either way! In addition, i loved the fact that it wasn't a problem if you wanted to take your breakfast/dinner up to your room. this wouldnt really be acceptable in most hotels and you might get some funny looks, but perfectly acceptable here :-) Location of Homewood Suites was brilliant. Most tourist attractions were easily reachable either by walking, or just a short distance away on a bus or the CTA. I was a bit worried about safety, being a girl on my own, in a city i didn't really know, but I felt surprisingly fine, and the staff were great with advice on any concerns i had. I am usually quite a difficult guest to please but I couldn't have been more pleased with my stay at this hotel - full marks - plus they have the most amazing pillows and gave me the best sleep i have had in ages!

The room was very clean and the kitchenette worked out great for us. While we didn't do any cooking, it was great having the refrig and microwave. They even supplied us free microwave popcorn. Every morning and every evening Mon-Thurs they have an area with food set up. The breakfasts always had some kind of eggs, meat, cereals and breads. For dinners, you could definitely make it your meal, but because Chicago is known for great restaurants, so it was nice to get a \"snack\" and then go out for dinner later. There was always plenty of food and they even had styrofoam containers to use to take up snacks to your room if you didn't want to eat in their dining area. One of the biggest perks staying at this hotel was free Internet in the rooms. We brought our lap top so we can research restaurants and sites we wanted to visit. The location is great, just 1 block from the subway system and 1 block from Michigan Avenue, very close to the river. It was a hike to Navy Pier, but we did it, though we took a taxi back! The only complaints I could give was parking our car was expensive, but the valet team was so courteous as was the entire hotel staff. And parking in Chicago is expensive everywhere. This place was no more expensive than other hotels we stayed at in the past. Also, our shower didn't have a way to keep water from going all over the bathroom floor so you needed to pay attention.

This hotel is fantastic. You see all those positive reviews on this site? Believe them because you cannot get a much better value for the money than with this hotel. Or maybe you can, but I'll make it easy for you and say that you won't. For starters, this hotel is perfectly located to just about everything. While this may seem like a bold statement, it really isn't. If the place you're trying to go to is not physically near, a mode of public transportation is very near for you to utilize to help you get to your destination. The Red Line subway is literally one block west of the hotel and can be used as your means of getting to and from O'Hare International Airport after utilizing the Blue Line. If the bus is more your thing, the stops are near here as well. What is also very near is the fantastic Magnificent Mile shopping district. You won't be in the hustle and bustle of this district with this hotel, but it'll be close enough for you to reach without using a bus, train, or taxi. The hotel itself if admittedly humble, but this works to its advantage. It's almost as if it is a hidden gem amongst the rest of the hotels that have huge signs begging for your attention. When you walk inside and go to the 6th floor front desk, you're greeted by a very knowledgeable and helpful staff that make the check in process way too easy. Before that you are always greeted by the very friendly doormen on the 1st floor who not only hold the door open for you, but will also give you tips on where to eat or what form of public transportation to take for a given destination. But back to the front desk, from the moment we said \"hello\" we were literally checked in in less than a minute. From the check in process you of course proceed to your room and with our particular room we had a view that was nothing short of stunning. My advice is to ask for a high floor if you are not afraid of heights because that will give you the best view possible. Along with the great view, we had a great room. Clean, spacious, homey, and the big thing...complete with a kitchen! The sofa bed was at first suspect feeling, but once I actually slept on it overnight I did not want to get up from it the following morning. The bathrooms are well lit and appropriately appointed with enough towels and soaps and all the stuff you would expect to see in there. The room is relatively quiet and not much outside noise comes in to cause a disturbance. Lastly, the food. The breakfast and the 'light meal' in the evening were well above average and should satisfy even the most critical of good food. The selection for both of these meals is wide enough given that they are included at no extra cost. The staff who are there when it is time for you to eat are extremely courteous and are always ready to assist you. Seriously, I can go on and on about this hotel, but the time has come for you to stop reading this and book your trip to Chicago with your hotel choice being this one.

The maid service (the only name I recall is Norma, which was the name on the cart) was top notch! They even aired out the room for us. Everyone was friendly, including the other guests. There was a lot of friendly chatter in the elevators. Here's what makes this hotel such a gem: It is unpretentious and down-home, like Chicago itself, but still attractive with more than a dash of style. People feel comfortable here. And the people who stay here run the gamut of types: Business people, couples, families. The location is excellent: The area is full of shops and restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets. We shopped at Nordstroms, Water Tower Place, up and down North Michigan and loved the Apple store there. One more word about the location: It is relatively safe, and teems with life from early morning until after midnight. Chicago is a very friendly city, and everyone who works in a frontline job must have taken a guest relations course. Somebody is doing something right here! By the way, nothing wrong with the parking fee here. It was actually less than we expected. You're in a city, for heaven's sake.

Chapter One: The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. The room was nice and clean as well. I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North. Very easy (one block) walk from the subway (Red line). The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. Not just muffins and coffee. You can have a complete breakfast here if you want. And, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. Chapter Two: The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival. The rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. When the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. I immediately called the hotel. They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. I did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .All done? NO. One week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. When I explained the error, I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told \"That's not my problem. I can't help you\". . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount. Excuse ME? Now, I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. After a few left messages, I get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . One week later, still no credit. So, I call the general manager again. Oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, I am told. So, please give it another week. Another week passes, still no credit. So another call to the manager. I am told now that the credit HAS been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our \"agreement\" for the credit, just to appease me. Another week passes. Still, not seeing that credit that was \"definitely processed\" a week ago. Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago. I told him I will be arriving, and at this point, I want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there. Remember, we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved. I arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was NEVER available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. The only person I spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. He was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of \"you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'\". . . WHAT???? Today, my trip is over, and I have flown back home. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT!!! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point.

The hotel has a room service arrangement with P.F. Chang's, and is within walking distance of a lot of nice restaurants.

We had 6 suites reserved at the prepay rate of $129.00 each for the weekend of August 28-30. The front desk was happy to give wedding goodie and snack bags, which I made up at home, to each member of our group as they checked in. When we detected a faint cigarette smell in our room when we first arrived, the front desk was prompt in moving us to a different room. They even gave us the largest suite avaiable on our floor, so that we would have a larger gathering place for our entire party of 13 people. Then, Rose, at the front desk, asked if we would like to have our whole party on the same floor. This was great since some were elderly and there were children, also. Some of the many extras the staff helped us with: bringing extra chairs to our suite, fetching items for the wedding from our valet-parked cars, rounding up mini-van taxis for our large group twice, bringing us extra towels and ice within minutes of calling for them. The hotel was sold out for the weekend, so the breakfast room was crowded and they had an overflow room opened, but they never ran low on food. On Saturday, they had a broken water pipe in the kitchen, so there was no hot food, but they were sincerely apologetic. There was a wait for an elevator at busy times, but we never waited more than a few minutes. They could have given a little more thought to which families got which size rooms. A couple using a crib were given one of the smallest rooms on the floor, which made it very tight in the room, while our single, senior citizen great-grandma got a corner unit with windows on 2 sides and a very large, uncrowded living area.

But, the location is worth it, it's a block from the Loop train (underground at State and Grand). And, you can walk everywhere in Chicago from this hotel, which is nice on a wonderful summer weekend. The suite is arranged with a kitcen, dining table for 2, a sleeper sofa and chair is one room, and a king size bed and the bath in the other room. The bathroom sink is separate from the toilet and shower, which is convenient. The kitchen has a dishwasher, serveware, coffee maker and toaster, plus a microwave and a 2 burner stove. And it has granite countertops, a nice touch. This hotel is thrilling all of the little ones, and fitness freaks. The 19th floor has a very nice pool,, 4 feet deep and long enough to do some laps.

There are lots of towels and tables and chairs for parents to relax, looking out over the city to the west. The fitness center has nice free weights, heavy balls and treadmills. If you prefer, there is a complimentaty pass to the health club Crunch next door. The full breakfast is a full breakfast - sausage and biscuits, corned beef, bacon, scrambled eggs, pastries, french toast, cereals, yogurt and cottage cheese, fresh fruit, toasted breads, coffee, tea, juices. They serve the breakfast in a dining hall that is crowded at peak times, so you can pack a box from the breakfast buffet and take it back to your room. No dinky cups, either...everything is full sized, and they keep replenishing the buffet until closing time. Outside the hotel, Nordstroms across the street has great sales, and you can walk inside through a mall to get to Michigan Avenue 2 blocks to the east - convenient on a rainy day. Restaurants in the area offer every kind of food. We tried Shaw's Crab House and Rockit and were very pleased. Be sure to try Ina's on W. Randolph for breakfast, too. Also not to miss in the area are Millennium Park - what a fun place for kids - and the beaches along Lake Michigan. We tried a street fair to the north and had a nice walk after having lunch there.

There is a gym inhouse, but you can use the Crunch gym next door (same building) that is much bigger and has everything. The entrance is not much to look at; just an elevator to the sixth floor where reception is. But the bellman was friendly and the reception desk was efficient and very friendly. It does cost a lot to park here (I think $42/night so don't bring a car). There is a small store next to reception, open 24/7. Free wired and wireless internet in the room. Only minor complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin so if the neighbor raises his voice I can hear it. Also, I can hear water running next door.

The downtown trolley stop is right around the corner, and we also got a cab easily one night. There are tons of restaurants nearby. The original deep dish pizza place, Pizzeria Uno, is on one corner , the ESPN Sports Zone restaurant is on another, and the Weber Grill restaurant around the block, to name a few. There was also a good brewery nearby for drinks. The suite was quite spacious with a full kitchen and a large bathroom. There was a TV in both the sitting area and the bedroom. We were on the 19th floor at the end of the hall and never heard anyone else, so it was quite restful. The building has one of the fastest elevators I've ever ridden on! There is a heated pool (no hot tub!) and small fitness room on the 19th floor, and guests can also use a fitness club that is next door. We went to the fitness club one of the days we were there and enjoyed the expanded equipment they had. Our room had complimentary wireless, and we had no problems with the internet connection. The complimentary breakfast was typical of the hot breakfast buffets with eggs, meat, waffles, fruit, etc., but I thought there were a few touches that made it above the standard. The fruit was all fresh, including fresh pineapple, and there were real dishes and silverware, not plastic. There were two attendants who kept everything stocked and cleared our tables. The dining area was large and comfortable. We were there for one night of the Manager's Special (weeknights, 5 - 7pm) and were shocked at how much food was served. It was really enough for a meal, not the light snacks we expected. We noticed several people doing carryouts to eat in their room, which was easy to do with the full kitchen and refrigerator. We had friendly and polite service from everyone we encountered the entire time, from the valets, to the front desk, to the dining area attendants, and cleaning staff. It seemed like there were just a lot of special touches, like bowls of snacks sitting out when we checked in (tired and hungry) and the complimentary daily newspaper. We got the suite for $119, which was an amazing value for downtown Chicago and the amenities it had. The only downside that others have commented on is the parking costs ($38). However, it was pretty comparable to the costs for parking at other downtown hotels, and it was nice to know that our car was safe in a covered lot.

We booked using Hilton points and called ahead for early check in. Arrived about 1:30 and the room was ready; there was free pink lemonade and snack mix in the lobby along with hot drinks. The front staff was very friendly and efficient. The lemoade was gone in the evening but there was a small store behind reception where you could but drinks, snacks, and souvenirs. Our room was on the 15th floor facing south with a great view of the downtown buildings including the beautiful new 90 story Trump Tower and the back of the Wrigley Building. We're long time Chicago area dwellers so it was nice to see the new addition to the skyline, especialy at night. The living room of the suite had a small kitchenette with a table and two chairs, a sofa bed, and an easy chair. The kitchen was simply but adequately stocked for cooking/dining ; the sofa bed felt \"springy\" but our 20 year old son seemed to sleep fine. The living room had a flat panel TV; the bedroom an older CRT. The entire suite had interesting art of Chicago architecture. The bedroom was a little small (you had to close the dresser drawer to get around the end of the bed) but nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. There was a single sink across from the closet and the toilet/bath in a separate room. It would have been nice to be able to get to the bathroom directly from the living room but they did fit a lot into a small space. The breakfast buffet the next morning was crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table, but the food was good. The waffle maker had the longest line so that held up the meal. Everything else was being constantly refilled. Overall it was a step up from Hampton but not as good as Embassy Suites. Oddly enough we could smell the 6th floor buffet in the hall on the 15th floor. We picked this hotel because of its rating, and the proximity to Lawry's, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop. The location was perfect; we strolled N Mich Ave a for an hour after checking in, walked the two blocks to Lawry's (GREAT Thanksgiving meal), and the next morning walked to see the <Macy's> windows in the Loop (nothing like the old Marshall Field windows).", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for toddlers, lots of comps, great location!\u201d", "Author": "Kid74", "ReviewID": "UR22220978", "Content": "Great place for kids! First, this place was a great value. We booked the park n play package, which included parking ($38) for $139 so it was basically $100 a night for a one bedroom suite. Especially given the location (right in the middle of downtown with great access to all the attractions) we thought this was an amazing deal. The room isn't huge, but was large enough for our family of four (1 and 3 year old) and it's always nice to have a separate room to put the kids! The other great perk to the stay was the free breakfast and dinner on weekdays. We thought the meals would be simple snack type fare, but it turned out to be full meals! The convenience of rolling out of bed and getting a hot breakfast downstairs was great. I figure we saved about twice the cost of the hotel just in food. As others have mentioned, the location is perfect. We took the free trolley right outside the hotel to Navy Pier to visit the Children's Museum. We also had less than a five minute ride to the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium. We didn't make it to Millenium Park, but that was close by as well. The shopping was also great. The Nordstrom's/Mall is directly across the street and Michigan ave is less than one block away.

The location is great--just a block or two from Michigan Avenue with lots of shopping and restaurants. The main entrance of the hotel faces Nordstrom which is located in North Bridge Mall. Lots of great shopping there and the Nordstrom even has a full-service spa. One of the ladies who was with us had a manicure there and was quite pleased with it. You enter the hotel at the Grand Avenue entrance (there is a valet there) and take the elevator to the 6th floor lobby to check in. The valet personnel and staff at the lobby desk were friendly and professional. Parking is a bit steep: $38/night, but you are in the heart of downtown Chicago..... There is a rooftop pool which we didn't have time to use because we were so busy doing other things, but if you have your heart on soaking in a hot tub, this will not be the place for you.... Breakfast both mornings we were there was quite ample: scrambled eggs, sausage, french toast, bagels and muffins, juice, coffee, biscuits and gravy--lots of choices and all good. Also loved the hot water/coffee station in the lobby with decaf and regular coffee and lots of teas plus hot chocolate packets to make your own and carry to your room! Make sure you head down to Ghirardelli's Chocolate Store where you can get coffee/hot chocolate drinks, of course their signature chocolate candies and even ice cream sundaes and other dessert treats to die for. We also took a horse and carriage ride (35 minutes) around Lakeshore drive and the general downtown area. It was a bit chilly when we went, but we had our Ghirardelli hot beverages, plus the carriage had blankets to put on our laps. Filene's basement, home of great bargains, is next door to Ghirardelli's as is a Borders Book Store. Ate dinner one night at the Grand Lux Cafe. Very, very good. It's owned by the same company that does The Cheesecake Factory. I had a peach bellini to drink and chicken lettuce wraps which was a large portion and I couldn't even finish....desserts are amazing: try the chocolate molten cake or the warm rustic apple pie. Lots of dessert choices--go on their website and check it out. They don't take reservations, so if you go for dinner, try and get there about 4:30. We had a 15 minute wait on a Saturday night and were glad we got in. During our dinner, the lobby area swelled with people waiting for a table...If you get there later than 5:00 pm, expect to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour. Hotel rooms have a nice kitchen area/dining room table--a bit on the small side, but we were on the 11th floor and had a corner room with nice views of the downtown area. Living area had a sofa that turned into a bed. Two of us shared the king-sized bed, and then we ordered a roll-away for the extra person in our party. Nice flat screen tv in the livingroom.....room wasn't ready when our party arrived and check-in staff gave us a bottle of wine to compensate for the wait. Everything was clean and having a refrigerator and all of the usual kitchen utensils (especially wine glasses!) and stove/microwave came in handy when we wanted to heat something up or store it for the next day in the fridge. I would definitely stay here again--it was a bit pricey--aside from the parking, we paid about $280 for our room, but this was a girl's weekend and was a splurge for us.

Pros: The location of this hotel was great for our travel purposes - it was an easy walk to the Navy Pier, up Mag. Mile, to American Girl Place, to the Hancock building and to Gino's East pizza. There is a Nordstrom right across the street from the hotel. We did take a cab to the Field Museum and Art Institute. The suite was clean, beds comfortable, and the carpeting new. The decor was nice. We had a fantastic view of the Hancock building from our room. We appreciated the large fridge. The breakfast (included with the room) was very good - much better than others we've had at other Homewood Suites. The indoor pool was recently refurbished and sparkling clean. The pool is located on the 19th floor (top floor) of the hotel and the city views are amazing - a unique swimming experience! We had the pool all to ourselves, but it is small and could get crowded... Cons: Housekeeping! Our room was not made up until after 4:00 p.m. each day, and we had to call and ask for housekeeping each day. Very annoying! Our other con for this hotel is that there is just a small single sink/vanity area in the bathroom - we prefer the double sinks at Embassy Suites. It could get a little crowded each morning as we all tried to get ready for the day. Also, there is no hot tub in the pool area - that would have been nice to relax in after all of the walking around we did each day.

Only one sink and mirror & no extra shelves to put toiletries. This can be less than ideal if the bath will be shared. It would have also been nice to have a few extra washcloths & hand towels-we kept running out. There are an abundance of interesting restaurants and shopping areas nearby (Nordstrom & Bloomingdales), as well as a movie theater. We especially enjoyed the Melting Pot (fondue) & Big Bowl (Asian)restaurants. We were able to walk to our sightseeing boat tour departure point at the Michigan avenue bridge. Also walked to Macy's. We took the free shuttle right outside the hotel to the Navy Pier as it looked like a bit of a walk.(the shuttle can get very crowded on weekends) On the morning of our departure we received very prompt & pleasant service from the bellman who retrieved our luggage & held a taxi for us.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Etobicoke, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!

We did not eat dinner at the hotel (if you aren't on a strict budget, I cannot see eating at the hotel when Chicago has so many great restaurants), but it was full every night. We did help ourselves to beer and wine, which we brough back to our room for an early evening break. -Location - A fairly quiet street, only 1 block from Mag Mile, and right in between Rush and Wabash.

So on the one hand they have wifi and internet in the rooms, and an enthusiastic full-service business-savvy front desk; on the other hand, they have a mini-market that has basic cooking staples, and they have a *coin laundry* (try finding that in a Marriott Courtyard!). During my stay, they managed to cater to both groups quite well. My only minor complaint was about breakfast -- yeah it's complimentary, and they have a lot of staff on hand to try to make it run smoothly.

Breakfast buffet had a large variety of choices to suit everyone. We did not care for the liquid scrambled cheese eggs (too dry and rubbery) and bacon, but everything else was great. We had malt waffles every day! Biscuits are hot and tender. Fresh whole fruit or cut up fruit is a plus, as is skim milk and yogurt. I would personally suggest trying the great restaurants that Chicago has to offer rather than the free dinner buffet (Mon-Thursday), but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a budget or have a large family to feed, etc. you might want to give it a try.

My price per night fluctuated from @189.00 to start, up to 312.00 by the end of my stay-of course I would have liked to have the cheaper price the whole stay. I would stay here again (if the price was right) and would recommend it.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cancun", "Title": "\u201cThe right choose\u201d", "Author": "ShrimpBucket", "ReviewID": "UR15906429", "Content": "Amazing location, Very close from the Hampton inn and the Hilton Garden Inn (downtown), so don\u00c2\u00b4t lose time, like i did, comparing locations, they are all great. You can have a 1 minute walk to the delicious, pricey, Joe's Stone Crab or a Sushi place with outstanding food quality and a forgettable name; if you walk to the other side you'll find P.F. Chang's. If you can walk more than a minute you will have numerous options. If working out is a must for you, as a homewood guest you can acces the \"crunch\" gym right next door. It's a really big place with lots of fine equipment, a paradise for the ones who need a gym. If you like running, it takes only a 2 minute jog to the track beside the lake where you can rent bikes or skates or just run. We walked to the stores, restaurants, theater (Jersey boys! a must!), Opera, Navy Pier, etc. If needed a taxi would cost 5-7 dollars. The room is nice, according to the price, with some details on the wallpaper and a small leak when rained (in a corner far away from the bed and sitting area, so we didn\u00c2\u00b4t mind) the room is not big but roomy and the view was perfetc!. Breakfast included is very good: fruit, kryspy kremes, eggs, cereals, breads, yoghur, etc. The staff at front desk are extremely corteous and helpful, they always gave us the best directions, tips and assistance. I will never go back to the other expensive hotels, this my hotel at Chicago from now on.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cOur home in Chicago\u201d", "Author": "dbolt", "ReviewID": "UR15641849", "Content": "We had a conference at the nearby Marriott and thankfully could not get a room there, since it would have been $3-400 a night there. We found Homewood Suites, which is literaly next door. From our room, we could look into the rooms at the Marriott. Boy are we glad we found this place. We paid $189 a night for 7 nights. If you stay 7 nights, it is considered \"extended stay\" and it is cheaper-probably cheaper total than if you stay 4-5 nights. Their pricing is a tad bit confusing because most room types have different rates on different nights, so just make sure you know what you average room rate is before thinking you got a great deal for all nights. Location: It is one block off Mag Mile, and across street from Nordstrom, PF Changs, Pizzeria Uno, Bloomingdales, ESPNzone etc. GREAT location within walking distance of anything on Michigan Ave. or the Loop. In the room they have menus from various eateries that will deliver. Rannallis is great for pretty basic italian fare and salads. They are fast and only charge $2.50 delivery. Public areas: The staff is very friendly. You take elevator to floor 6 for lobby, shop, and dining room..... Almost the best part is the breakfast, which is probably the best complimentary brekfasts I have had a hotel ever. Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, panckaes, french toast or fresh waffles, cereal, donuts, bread bagels fruit, yogurt, juice hot drinks. It got a little monotonous after 7 days, but the higher end-hotels don't even have this nice a breakfast for $$. NOR do the ritzey places have a buffett dinner. It is Mon-Thursday and is basic, but they have themes. Spagetti and meatballs, hamburger, pizza, Philly Cheese steak, chinese, etc. Usually some steamed veggies, small salad bar, hot entree and usually some kind of vegetarian option like mac/cheese, potatoes. Beer and Wine and soft drinks. Cake and pudding for dessert. Very passable, especially if you think that yo are saving $40 on dinner or more. We ate there 2 night out of 7. You can take the food to-go up to your room as well. Room: we had a corner room. All the \"_04\" rooms are on the southeast corner which affords a view from the Hancock Tower to the Trump Tower and Wrigley Building in the middle. We loved it. You walk in and it has an almost full kitchen (no oven) with fridge, 2-burner cooktop, microwave, sink, dishwasher and dishes for about 4 people. Then there is a living area with dining table/desk, two dining chairs, an easy chair, couch, coffee table and tv. The bedroom has a confy king bed with pelty of pillows and clean duvet cover, tv and standard bathroom. You can close the bedroom door and the couch folds out. You have to go thru the bedroom to get to the bathroom. The dcor is urban, with warm colors and some ncie bw photos of Chicago architecture. There is free wireless and ethernet cable internet in the room, which worked great. They also have a business center on floor 6 with printers, and conference table etc, so you can print out boarding pass etc. All the expensive hotel charge $10 a dayand that is if you can get it to work properly. Overall, we were REALLY pleased with the quality AND value. These days you are lucky to get one of thsoe in a hotel, but to get both-wow, that says a lot. It makes you wonder how Hilton is able to do it, and makes you wonder how much profit these swankier palces make on just a simple room and no extras at all and still charge twice as much. We will be back to this place and will look for more of these Homewood Suites elsewhere.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood location and very nice\u201d", "Author": "KappyMe", "ReviewID": "UR14848268", "Content": "This hotel is very good in general. Good for families like us as rooms are spacious. Good value as breakfast and light dinner (Mon-Thurs) included. Location is great for the Magnificent mile. Main advise is not to trust the staff to help you with any transport. Staff at check-in (6th floor) are unware of information on getting around so refer you to the staff on the ground floor. I needed to get to another town, the staff booked me a terrible taxi with a man with a broken arm at an exhorbitant rate (I think he was related or something). The guy didn't know the route and didn't hang around for the return as previously agreed as he reckons he got an emergency call from the hospital who wanted to see him .... I didn't think hospitals were that responsive!!! I was told by the guy who sorted this out that limos would charge $300 each way. In the end I had to get a limo for the return which cost me $80 ... way cheaper than what the taxi driver charged me.

It cost $179 per night plus parking. We checked in an hour early and were given upon request a corner room on the top floor. The indoor pool was on the same floor. My wife and two daughters, ages 8 & 10 enjoyed the pool and the convenience of walking down the hall to go swimming. There is a free breakfast buffet and at 5:00 p.m., wine, beer and a light dinner during the week. The location was great and we had a 15 minute walk to the American Girl Store. The concierge/bellman, Rod, was very helpful and got as a discount for the river cruise which was also a short walk from the hotel. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.

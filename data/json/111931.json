Bring a picnic, or walk one block to get to downtown Calistoga and buy a picnic lunch and bring it back (there is even a winetasting place within a block). They allow you to bring food and drinks (alcoholic too!) to enjoy at the tables that surround the pools. This place is not only great, but kid-friendly. There is a large gazeboed hot tub which is adults only, but they have a kids warm pool under a waterfall, and the lanes pool and other hot pool are open to kids (they even allow flotation devices).

But that also has advantages, because windows open and everything is handy. There are good lamps and the right amount of furniture. I like comfort and function above the ultra frou frou look. The kitchen is really useable also, but if one were staying longer, it might be nice to bring a blender or toaster. There are so many good restaurants, who wants to cook full meals? However, the ground floor rooms look out on a very nice patio area with picnic tables and grills. Many people barbeque here. They also have handy bike racks, but you have to bring your own bike. They can be rented on the main street. This is another great thing about the spa, it is one block from the main street of Calistoga and from a lovely bike path. The service could be better. I asked for late check-out of 12:00 and I called at 8:30 a.m. The desk person said all the late checkouts had been given out. ???? Calling the night before they say to call in the a.m. I noticed a huge number of people leaving early, so it seemed to me they are not being accommodating. Furthermore, the check in time is at 3 p.m. I wish we could get a law passed that specifies a hotel, spa or motel must give a customer 24 hours of time. As it stands, the check-in is at 3 and the check out is at 11:00. We went at the height of the season so expected to pay a good price, but this spa keeps raising their rates, so that it was really approaching $200 per night for 2 of us and a 12 year old. They have 3 pools and a large very hot pool that I never use. I like a pool around 90 degrees and only the kiddy pool is this temperature. Pools are 104, 100, and 80 respectively. The 80 degree pool is very comfortable when it is really hot, which it was in the afternoon. But for me in the a.m. and p.m. when the temperature outside dropped to maybe 60, the 80 degree pool is too cold. But the 100 degree pool is too hot to swim..

The gym facility is completely outdated. The mud bath was great but the one hour massage left much to be desired (not worth $100 by a long shot). My husband burned his foot in the steam room and when he mentioned it to staff, they said \"Yeah, that's happened to a couple of people\". Well, if that's happened to more than one person, they should fix it, no? Dr. Wilkenson's across the street has a similar mud bath treatment and a much much better massage. The pools were very enjoyable but at times kind of crowded. Room service is marginal. They just do your bed and change the towels. They did not do our dishes (the few that there were) nor did they really clean the shower. The day we were leaving there was no hot water (although we did get a small discount for this). I think the best thing about this place are the pools and the fact that they are kid friendly. However, for $200 a night, which is what it comes out to be with all the taxes and tourist fees, it is completely not worth it. If the rooms were around $120-150, then yes, I might consider coming back. Speaking of which, I though the rooms would be around $150 a night but because it was a holiday week (a few days before and New Year's eve), it turned out to be much more expensive. They really should advertise holiday prices on their website so that people know what they are going to pay. The total bill was a bit of a surprise and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Last Labor Day, we stayed here for three nights, and this time, just for two. It's hard to describe this hotel, and though there are things to complain about, we were totally blissed out the whole time we were there. Part of it was the lovely hot weather and all the festivities going on for the Fourth in Calistoga, an adorable town that we love more every time we visit. The hotel is perfectly located for exploring the main street and a 10 or 15-minute walk to the county fairgrounds where we went to a magical old-fashioned carnival. But back to the hotel--the rooms are very dated, and the beds a bit hard and yes the pillows are flat and they're aren't enough of them. They don't provide wine glasses (it's Napa Valley, hello), and they are stingy with pool towels. You can never use the grills because other guests claim them at 8am by putting bags of charcoal on them and basically claiming entire areas. Granted, we've only stayed here on major holiday weekends--it can't be this bad all the time. We were irked by many little things, but the pools, the landscaping, the general ambiance of the place, makes us feel right at home, and we love watching our daughter go back and forth between the kiddie pool and the big pool like she owns the place. We had to fight to get a table (the guests there have an annoying tendency to completely take over every available chair and lounger for the whole day, even if they don't show up until 2 or 3pm, and that was frustrating, but still, we always found a spot, and loved going back and forth to the room, to the hot pools at night, to town for breakfast. We could even see the fireworks from the parking lot. So, with all of these annoyances why do i love this place so much? I can't really say--but we are already planning to go back. If you have kids, it's a great place, the best in town, because it's family-friendly. Don't expect pampering or really nice rooms.

People need to realize that what they call a \"spa\" - the scented everything, the soft lighting, the expensve \"custom\" products... those are just add-ons to the basics - mineral water, massage, mudbath... That's what you'll find here. Mineral water - three pools' worth (and a baby pool) - massage (very good ones), and mudbaths (don't come to Calistoga and not have a mudbath!). Staying here, you have all day access to all the pools, so you can nap and soak and nap and soak. Very nice. Rooms are pretty basic, but have TV and internet. Could use a few more pillows, and mattresses are pretty unspectacular - quite firm. Since the rooms are kitchenettes, you can also make your own breakfast and lunch and whatever and save a bundle. I've been coming to Calistoga and staying here a couple times a year for probably 20 years or more. I always schedule at least one mudbath and a massage. I have learned the best time is during the week, check in on a Monday and check out on a Thursday or Friday. Look around on a crowded weekend and you'll see every \"rule\" being violated, from \"no cell phones in pool area\" to \"no children under 14 in the hot pool\" to \"barbecues for hotel guests only\". So if you're coming to relax, don't come on a weekend. Too many doting parents ignoring their kids' obnoxious behaviors; people up late and having wine-soaked, maudlin discussions on the patios that waft into your open windows. During the week, esp. off season, it's mellow. After the public hours end (around 9p, I think), it's wonderful to go take some wine down to the pools and look at the stars. There's a great grocery across the street, and plenty of good restaurants on the main drag or nearby. Lots of Russians and other eastern europeans around during the week - which can be interesting, they're usually pretty nice and fun to talk with. Again, it's nothing fancy, offers the basics, a nice staff... you can visit day spas in town for more upscale products and atmosphere, but I think you're missing what Calistoga - beautiful, down-to-earth, funky, time-warped Calistoga - is all about.

We stayed during the noisy construction. Now...it takes a minimum of 2 months to get a reservation. The staff is not particularly friendly and you get the feeling that your business does not matter. We come because of the pools only. The only room worth staying in is the suite above the office, if you can get it. They don't allow children there however. To simply come and lay by the pool has gone from, $6.00 a day to 35.00. Can you believe that? I guess they want to discourage the day visitors but, living as close as I do, I would often come up for the day. The cost is now prohibitive even if affordable. It's a matter of principle. Anyway, enjoy the pools...tolerate the rest. Indian Springs has really upped the experience there. You might want to give it a try.

I agree generally with the reviews I see here, but I rate the place higher than most reviewers. Here's why: Yes, it lacks the glitzyness normally associated with Napa Valley lodgings. The decor, while not offensive, is nothing special. But I think that's the charm of the place--it's friendly and homey, not pretentious and snooty. Our room was very clean, with a nice kitchenette and a great, large shower in the bathroom (two shower heads). The rooms face the inner courtyard which is pocked with little alcoves containing picnic tables and barbecues. The combination of kitchenette inside and pools and barbecue outside provides a family-friendly oasis in the Napa Valley. Unlike other NV lodgings, you could stay here and save a lot on food by preparing many meals yourself. Many restaurants and a grocery store are steps away. Pools were great in the evening. All employees we encountered were friendly. One quirk: Even though it was chilly outside, the room got quite hot, and we had to run the air conditioner. No problem, really, but we felt funny running the A/C in the winter.

The Rooms are quite large- each has a kitchen with small dining table. The bathrooms are clean and also quite large. There are plates, knives, and etc. in the kitchen as well.

It was a short walk to downtown and Pikes Place. Our kids liked it so much they didn't want to leave. Most hotels are sterile, but this hotel was very homey. We felt comfortable from the start. The staff was very pleasant, the breakfast worked out great for us and we really enjoyed having Cafe Ladro right at the end of our hallway. We took a number of walks up the hill to see great views, enjoy a wonderful bakery and relax with a beer. Having a partial kitchen and dining area helped as Metropolitan Market is just down the street. Other hotels gave us the runaround because there were 5 of us staying in a room, not the Marqeen! Even with 5 people we had plenty of room and didn't feel as though we were stepping on one another. The downsides....our view was a mural on a brick wall, no airport shuttle (or shuttle of any kind) and occasionally sound from the front desk area would carry to our room at night. Overall though, this is an excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it.

I picked this hotel because it was close to a restaurant across the street that I wanted to try -Toulouse Petit Kitchen & Lounge - and it had great ratings on the Trip Advisor.

The hotel was an apartment house converted into hotel suites. With three floors (no elevator) and a grand double stairway, it felt like an intimate European hotel. The staff was very gracious and gave us a room on the third floor overlooking the street. Our room was actually a suite with a bedroom, a sitting room with sofa and chair, an entry hall, full kitchen and several closets. The bathroom was large and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable. The floors were hardwood with rugs and tile in the kitchen and bath. It was comfortable, clean, cozy and inviting.

The lobby reminded me of the Titanic with all of its grandeur. The chandliers and wood work are incredible. The continental breakffst was sufficient as we usually ate too much the evening before. The Mexican resturant across the street and the Dueling Piano bar around the corner are both a must to experience. The king size bed was very comfortable and we found the maid service was good, with only a bit of a language barrier.

It is just up the hill a few blocks from the Space Needle and if you walk through the park you pass through the old grounds of the Worlds Fair of 1962 called Seattle Center with the International Fountain & the entrance to the Monorail which goes 1 1/2 miles to downtown to Nordstroms and other transportation such as the last stop of the metro which comes from the airport and buses. You can use the bus system to get to the Boeing Museum of Flight that is out by the SeaTac airport. It is also walkable to go down the hill to the Waterfront, Pikes Place Market, and the original Starbucks which is across the street from the market. There is a store that makes its own cheese, a number of bakeries, and fruit stands on the way down the hill. We left from one of the piers on the Clipper to Victoria to stay a few days. The Hotel is an experience in that you go back in time to an earlier day. It has quite a history. Don't expect it to be modern, but do expect comfort, cleanliness, quietness, and privacy. We did stay long enough to use the kitchen facilities but it would have been convenient. The sitting room was small but comfortable & we spent time there planning our trip, using our computer to make reservations and finding information. The lobby and staircase are gorgeous and the desk help and bellhop were cheerful, friendly, helpful and informative. They can give you directions! Yes, there is no elevator but the stairs aren't that bad and they helped us carry the suitcases up. The breakfast is basic but just fine. The lady helping to set it up was very friendly. We took a couple of granola bars for the road after having morning coffee and tea. You could have bagels, oatmeal, toast, fruit, etc. There is a coffee shop/bakery next door that has more if you want it. The Mexican restaurant across the street is excellent and not overpriced. It's a \"hoppin' place\" on the weekends because of the bar attached and there was a line to get in. Probably quieter during the week.

AAI recommended The Marqueen - and they were right. A great marble slab stoop leads into this quaint 1900 era establishment. Looking around, you'd almost expect gas lighting to illuminate its curtained hallways. No Marriott cookie cutter, sterile environment here. Immerse yourself in Old town Seattle. large rooms with wooden floors, sound-proof double pane windows and kitchenettes - (fridge, sink, coffee aker and small seating area). The one immersion I could do without is the lack of elevator. However, if you are traveling light & spry of step, the grand staircase is fun to bounce up and down. A nice happy hour with wine and cheese will get you in the mood to relax and socialize in this great little Queen Anne hotel. And the chilled water urn in the lobby on the sideboard is a welcome relief after arriving and checking in. Within the hotel itself is a great coffee shop (Cafe Ladro), no over roasted beans here, they open at 5am, so it made life easier since we like to rise early & get rolling. On the other side of the building is a spa that we didn't have time to make it into, but it got good reviews and smelled divine. Across the street from the Marqueen are several interesting dining choices. Pesco's (Mexican - w/ sloooooooow indifferent service) & Toulouse Petit (Creole). They are owned by the same people yet are as different as salt & peppa. Our favorite was Toulouse Petit & I recommend its HUGE french toast & evening tasting menus. The Space Needle & City Center are an easy walk from this lovely hotel.The staff is very helpful & can recommend fun places to visit and ways to get around as you tour around the area.

Great location, too--half hour walk from major shopping, Pike Place Market, etc. About 15 minutes from the Science Center and Space Needle. Lots of good food and grocery stores near Queen Ann ave as well. Hmm. What else did I like? Housekeeping was great, service was great--coffee at Cafe Ladro was bold and delicious. My complaints are minimal, but here they are: Transparent curtains let in quite a bit of morning light (not good if you like to sleep in), and the shower had terrible pressure (but hey, I still got clean!). On my third night, water began dripping from the ceiling, too. There are notices in the bathrooms that say an overflowing tub will cause drippage in the room below, so I think the people above might have taken a splashey bath or something. It wasn't a big deal, they offered to put us in another room but the water soon stopped dripping. Not a big deal. Overall, very delightful stay at the Marqueen.

Yes, the hotel is old, but that hasn't caused us any problems. Rooms are quite large by hotel standards, and prices are lower than most hotels in Seattle. This is an independant hotel where they have done a nice job in restoration of a very old building. No, it's not \"restored to 1900s grandeur\" (nor do they claim that) but it's completely comfortable and definitely not visually sterile like most hotels today. Our room had a very comfortable bed and a much less comfortable sofabed ( but all sofabeds are). Decor was older style but fully maintained - in other words older furniture but in great shape. They've done alot with crown molding but the modern walls in the rooms (ie. textured wallboard) look a bit out of place in parts. The bathrooms are perfectly OK. Ours has a long tub (much longer than most hotel tubs). I normally shower but took the opportunity for two nice soaks in the tub - becuase I can. Hotel service has been friendly and good. They serve a continental breakfast that could be a little more variety. There is free wifi, which works well but was not super-fast. Biggest negative - the floors squeak. And I mean WOW do they squeak. Our floor is hardwood with area rugs, and each step could wake the dead, or at least your sleeping companions. Important - many earlier reviewers complained about the street noise. The hotel claimed they were installing noise-abatement windows in street-facing rooms. Verdict: the hotel did as claimed, and the windows work great. We face the street and see the traffic but hear almost nothing. Other reviewers have pointed out that there is no elevator. One reviewer even complained that \"the last thing you want to do after a day of walking is climb 5 flights of stairs\". That complaint is a little unfair as this hotel has only 3 floors, hence 2 flights of stairs. It's really a non-issue. The location is awesome - with lots of great restaurants just steps away. Don't underestimate the value of this in a city where parking is difficult and expesnive. The hotel does charge $25 a day for valet parking with unlimited in/out but in 3 nights we always found free street parking nearby (but I think we lucked out a bit on that).

However the valet-bell man was quick to move our luggage up and down the stairs as needed. The wireless internet worked well most of the time and there are numerous outlets throughout the rooms. The temperature was easy to set and quick to adjust. Our rooms had kitchens with in-room coffee, refrigerators, sinks, microwaves and tables. Water pressure was reasonable and the shower-bathtub faucets, easy to work. Every few days, the hotel hosts a late afternoon wine and hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeurves reception that includes some very tasty local foods. The continental breakfast is limited, but satisfactory - consisting of yogurt, orange juice, various breads, apples and coffee. There are a number of restaurants, coffee shops and a large grocery store within a short walking distance of the hotel. The front desk staff is very helpful, but the housekeeping service is not thorough or consistent. Our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room was not made up until very late in the afternoons, conflicting with the time they wanted to dress for evening activities.

The hotel is located at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, a lively commercial and nightspot area. The building itself has a lot of potential. It was built around the turn of the 20th century, and is loaded with \"Old World Charm\", as they say. The owners have tried - rightly - to capitalize on this heritage, with historic photos on the wall, and Victorian-style potted palms and plants in oversized urns. There are lovely oriental carpets and the rooms are large- - they are really \"single\" apartments (size-wise they are between a one bedroom and a studio). So what's the problem? There are a few, actually. We noted that the management has TRIED to capitalize on the historic nature of the building, but they have come up a bit short. To wit: The aforementioned potted plants? Fake. The oriental carpets (and the rest of the carpeting, for that matter) were tired and dingy. Not filthy, but dowdy. The red carpet (a nice touch) on the marble steps at the main entrance was marred by two crushed cork-tipped cigarette butts on the night we arrived. These details belie a standard of cleanliness and care that is noticeably below par. The place aims to be your glamorous old aunt but actually comes off a bit dowdy. The old girl needs a good scrubbing and some TLC. Then there is the matter of service. We have stayed at the Marqueen three times, and the service has been uneven. Sometimes very good, but more often simply lackadaisical, and occasionally surly. (Open note to management: An establishment that employs a \"doorman\" should instruct that person to OPEN THE DOOR for people as they approach, and not merely watch as patrons struggle to do so on their own). One gets the impression that these problems -- irritating though they may be -- are not insurmountable.

Although some of the review was mentioning about noise, we thought having a spacious comfortable room was important. When we arrived, there were one couple before us, and they were asked if they prefer quiet room. They took the quiet room on 3rd floor. When we were checking in, the front desk person did not ask our preference... I just let it go, and took the room she gave us. Which turned out to be the direct across the noisy bar on 2nd floor room 204. It wasn't very noisy when we checked in around 4 pm. It was Wed. The noise from the bar started around 9 pm and ended around 2:30 am. Even though the window was shut, it could still hear the screaming guys and gals smoking outside the bar. I believe the hotel knew the noise problem from the bar, because there were set of ear plugs in the snack basket for the guest. We had to use ear plugs for the night. It was still weekday, I could not imagine how noisy the weekend will be!!! Next morning we changed to quiet room on 3rd floor facing backside of the building. Rest of the stay was wonderful. It is a funny thing... although we had loud noise problem, I still think staying at this hotel gave us sense of living in seattle. And we loved it. Maybe because the hotel is kind like an apartment, you feel like living there. Having a kitchen and dining area was very nice. It was very nice to have separate living area with sofa and coffee table. One more thing... if you have a car, parking around the hotel will be tough! There are a lot of restriction for street parking. You should expect to pay $20 per day for valet parking at hotel. You will be able to take car in and out through out the day. but you also pay tip to valet parker. When I went to downtown to meet my husband, I walked to monorail just about 10 min nice walk from the hotel. Once you take monorail, it only takes 2 min to get to Westlake Shopping Center which is the center of downtown. If you decided to stay at MarQueen, avoid room on 2nd floor facing the street. If you want to have quiet room, ask for 3rd floor facing the back side of the building. You will have a little bit of the space needle in view from the window.

After talking with almost every other hotel in seattle, the Marqueen had the best rates for the rooms/amenities (they also run a stay 3 nights, get the 4th free- check out their website for these deals!), excellent location and were amazingly easy to work with. They offered us a small block of rooms without needing a guaranteed %, and being a detail fanatic, I went back and forth with the guest service manager MANY times and he was always super nice. They also left us a bottle of champagne in our room the night of our wedding! Very thoughtful. The rooms are like small apartments- the pictures posted by previous guests are very accurate and we also stayed in room 202 (has a nice view out the front of the hotel onto 1st?). They have a small kitchenette, built in dining space, huge bedroom and a small sitting room. We used 202 as the brides getting ready room, and it housed all the people and comer/goers without ever feeling crammed. The marqueen itself is an older building with great architecture and light, so we also took our 'first sight' pictures here before we headed off to the wedding as bride/groom. What I like most about hotels, once they have the basics down (large room, clean, internet, etc) is the service. And with a bellman to help you the second your car pulls up, and who opens/closes the front doors for you every time you arrive, and the front desk who were very nice... the marqueen adds the extra touch you're looking for! Esp during your wedding weekend. Other details: - Only drawback (for some, but I didnt think so) is that they dont serve breakfast. But you have a kitchenette or Pesos across the street has very yummy breakfasts! - Very close to multiple restaurants on lower queen anne, 2 large grocery stores, a Kits Camera (which came in handy), dry cleaners, Kinkos and 2 starbucks- all within a 4 block radius of the marqueen. - Super clean rooms and the maids were really good about not disturbing all our wedding stuff, yet still organizing the room during service. - They have a downtown shuttle which was awesome (fyi- the marriott on lake union doesnt have a shuttle- we had some guests staying there and overall, were disappointed). - Parking was easy, although we valeted with the hotel most of the time for minimally more. - FREE internet, which also worked well/fast! Hooray. * I didnt notice an elevator for older guests or handicapped, although there might have been one. But they do have rooms on the first floor. Overall, 5 stars and we highly recommend the Marqueen! Enjoy. (I havnt added our own pics, as room 202 was already posted by another reviewer, and we were quite messy in our room!

Positives: As noted by other reviewers, the room was large, including a kitchenette, large sleeping area, walk-in closet and average sized bathroom. The service was excellent: attentive and efficient. And, the hotel itself is in a good location, with lots of restaurants nearby, and it is just a couple of blocks to attractions like the Space Needle, Key Arena, and others. Negatives: Again as noted by other reviewers, the place smells. A musty, stale, smell hangs over the lobby, and exists throughout the hotel. The lobby itself has a run-down look, as did my room. Threadbare rugs on floors, worn hardwood, all the polish off the bathtub, bathroom floor tile in desperate need of re-grouting, worn doorhandles, creaky floors....the list goes on. I get that the motif is going for a jazz age atmosphere, but I've been in hotels that manage character without looking, feeling, and smelling worn. Warnings: A couple of things didn't bother me, but might put off other travellers. First, there's no elevator (the hotel has only 3 floors). Second, my room at the front of the hotel was subject to a good deal of street noise: the street outside seems a busy thoroughfare for cars, and the restaurants/night spots seemed to spit out handfuls of loud (but not rowdy) crowds each night. Not overbearing noise, but noticeable. Booking through Expedia cost me about $160/night.

Photos of early Seattle and its leaders line the hallways. Some of the floors are creaky, but to me that just adds to the ambiance of an old hotel. The room we stayed in had a small kitchen and living room area, and could have been someone's apartment in years past. -LOCATION PART 1: You are within walking distance to Key Arena. You don't have to fight traffic going home from a Sonics game or a concert. You can go to the Space Needle and eat at some pretty decent restaurants in the area. -LOCATION PART 2: Kerry Park. This is close to the hotel, and the best site in town for photographing the Emerald City. When you see the postcards of Seattle, this is where many of those shots are taken. It's on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill, located at the corner of 2nd Avenue W. and W. Highland Drive. -PRICE: For Seattle, the price is a bargain.

The Inn at Queen Anne is the sister hotel of the MarQueen Hotel. Even though we had booked our room five months in advance, upon arrival we were told that they did not have a room for us but advised they had booked us into the MarQueen around the corner. The MarQueen is an old style hotel. There was very limited parking out front but we were lucky enough to get a park whilst we unloaded our bags. Fortunately for us, we were taking the car back to the rental depot so didn't have to worry about parking. The room we were given was large with a separate kitchen and lounge. The kitchen had a microwave and fridge. There was a large TV with all the usual channels. Everything was really good until we turned off the TV to go to bed. It was then that we heard the noise from the music and the people across the road at a restaurant/club. The noise got progressively louder. We rang the desk to find out how long it goes for and were advised 2.00 am. They offered to ring the establishment if we wanted (couldn't imagine that working) or we could use the ear plugs in the 'honour bar' (at a cost - I think it was $1). The fact that they had ear plugs available made me think that this is a regular occurrence. We certainly were not forewarned by the staff. Just as we were told, the noise continued until just after 2.00 am. Breakfast was not provided at this hotel. As you can imagine, we were not overjoyed at initially being turned away from the hotel we booked, only to be sent to another hotel ( allegedly a higher rating) where we were kept awake until 2.00 am. Considering the stuff ups, I was concerned we may have been charged the higher rate at the MarQueen, than our initial hotel, so I enquired at the desk.

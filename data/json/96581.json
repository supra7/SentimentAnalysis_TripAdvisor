This property is old and looks it; Marriott simply needs to scrap it and build a new one. There is no shortage of nice hotels in the Branson area and I\u2019m not sure how this one competes other than by patrons that use their hotel rewards like me. At approx. $160 per night you can do much better. The carpet, walls, interior all scream to be replaced. The breakfast area is almost like a hallway and lines were long both mornings. The rooms do have newer HD flat screens and appliances (at least the one I stayed in did), but the rest of the property reminds me of an old lake lodge. The thing that makes this place tolerable is the wonderful staff that they have working there! Everyone from Neill, the General Manager, to the kitchen staff were incredibly helpful, sincere, and just all around nice!!

We stay at Marriott Residence Inn frequently, and this one is NOTHING like the rest! We stayed at the Residence Inn in Springfield for a night and it's just as we've come to expect....clean, beautiful, great breakfast including many healthy options, professional and friendly staff. The Branson location feels very old with \"almost\" remodeled rooms (furniture is still oak laminate and the tub/shower/lighting in bathroom seemed really old, but the walls and kitchen and bedding are nice, other than terrible pillows...bring your own!). The front desk area is full of clutter and cheap laminate cabinets and the front desk staff uniforms look more like outdated and falling apart housekeeping shirts. Come on people...buy some polo shirts or something, time to update. The dining area is OK. Plain, but OK. The housekeeping was good, typical of most Residence Inns. The pool is so much smaller than photos made it appear, and the tile and grout is in need of replacing, the pool area is very old and feels like a large laundry room. This was disappointing as our kids love to swim in hotel pools and even they said it was \"yucky\". The breakfast was cheap food and there were no healthy options. I was shocked that the only yogurt they offered was \"trix\" yogurt that was full of sugar and hot pink/neon yellow. The only fruit (other than canned fruit cocktail) were granny smith apples, no melon or bananas like other properties. Other properties also offer adult yogurt and granola, but not this one. Oh, and no hot chocolate packets or flavored coffee creamer either, just half and half. The breakfast staff person was VERY cranky every morning and we even heard other guests talking about how she woke up on the wrong side of the bed. The biscuits and gravy and the waffles are the only redeeming food at the breakfast, but they waste so many plastic cups by filling them with batter and putting lids on, only to be thrown away. Other properties have a batter dispenser and a cup to fill over and over so there is no waste. Other than being a very cheesy, outdated (other than previously mentioned updates) rendition of Marriott residence Inn, the very most shocking part of our stay was having our breakfast interrupted every single morning by people trying to sell us show tickets. I'm not kidding, they come right to your table as you're eating and try to sell you tickets, and it's a very hard sell! One was a magician selling his own show, another was a guy selling some morning show and we said no thanks and he said the kids would love it and started acting out part of the show but our youngest just looked scared of this weird guy and our teenager said \"Awkward!\" After he left. I can't believe this is allowed to go on, and I'll be letting the corporate offices know that nobody wants to be solicited. I doubt corporate even knows, the property managers probably just get a kickback on sales. It's just so Tacky. Anyhow, I rarely write reviews , and I think this may be my first on Yelp, but we were so disappointed and I wanted to warn other loyal MRI guests that this property is NOTHNG like you would expect. Everyone should do themselves a favor and stay at the Springfield location a half hour north. The extra drive into town will be well worth it for the upgrade in hotel experience.

I didn't have either the biscuits, gravy, waffles, cereal, yogurt, or muffins but did have a donut. It IS free however and offers something other than just a donut and juice for breakfast! I did find that our housekeeper fudged on vacuuming as my husband had eaten something with crushed almonds on it and some got on the carpet and when we came back to the room and the room had been cleaned the nuts were still in the same place on the floor, but I can certainly bend over and pick up a few nuts. They also have cheap plastic shower curtain liners that get mildewed on the bottom and no one had cleaned the one in our bathroom. Our housekeeper did provide daily extra towels for us, was always very pleasant, and overall the room was clean everyday. All in all, we will definitely stay here again and again.

Our experience was great then, so we opted for our 2010 return visit (now with two near-teenagers and a grandmother in tow) to the same location. We weren't disappointed. My experience with Residence Inn properties has been varied over the years, but this facility was wonderful. We were able to book a two-bedroom suite capable of hosting five with kitchenette for $189/night barely two weeks before our arrival. Our room was clean, with fresh linens on the bed (you can't always assume that these days, even on a new check-in) and extra towels and pillows available per our reservation request. The only downside was that the fold-out sofabed was not large enough to accommodate both kids, necessitating a rollaway bed rental at an additional $15/night. That was the only disappointment in a room rated to sleep 6, but couldn't possibly do so in practical terms (and that's why the room rating is only 4/5). We were able to meet our assigned housekeeper, who went out of our way to meet our requests for towels, sheets, and other sundries. The location of this Residence Inn is on the east side of Wildwood Drive, perhaps a quarter-mile away from Branson's \"main drag' (W 76 Country Blvd). Its central location is absolutely ideal for access to any of the area's main attractions. Although we didn't avail ourselves of it this trip, a public golf course is directly across the street, and clubs can be rented via the hotel's front desk. The only negatives during our stay were problematic keycard readers that made guest-only entry access a bit trying at times; as many as three keycards were needed to open the door. The keycard reader on the door to the room was slightly less troublesome; its possible the device that imprints the code on the keycards could be at issue. Additionally, the free breakfast buffet offered each morning was only marginal; the sausage patties looked strange, as if they'd been boiled, and the biscuits were microwaved - yet the scrambled eggs were good. The evening snack bar was a pleasant surprise with a variety of \"snack-style\" suppers available. For its consistency and prime location, we'd heartily recommend this Residence Inn and would return.

The indoor heated swimming pool was a little small. It felt crowded with 6 people in it. There's also a hot tub. It was all still very nice! The rooms have a living room with couch and love seat, full kitchen w/ table, and a separate bedroom with full bath. Both the living room and bedroom had large TVs in them.

We stayed at the Residence Inn. The place was nice. Delux Breakfast every morning and late afternoon early evening they had a light meal Monday thru Thursday. The only complaint we had was the swimming pool. The water was cold--about 55 degrees. We complained to the maintenance men, and they said the water was 83 degrees and 103 in the hot tub. After complaining to the manager the next day, the temperature was raised the following day. Unfortunately both my wife and I got sick from the cold pool and could not use the pool facilities when the temperature was corrected, and even though we went to shows, we could not enjoy ourselved entirely because of being sick. The shows are great, clean and funny. We did the dinner train on Saturday and had a great time. We shared a table with a very nice couple from Texas. They were RVing, possibly my next vacation. This was the highlight of our visit. The entire train ride and meal were excellent. On Sunday we did the show boat on Table Rock Lake. The dinner again was excellent, the show great and the paddle wheel boat on the lake calming and scenic. They also have a new shopping area on the river front in down town Branson. Beautiful, especially at night with the changing lights and friendly people. Shows, great meals, nice clean place to stay, and people friendly enough to just sit and talk to, what a difference from the Northeast.

The entire 3rd floor smelled like smoke even though it was nonsmoking. The rooms are very dated and old looking. If I had to speculate, I would say that the rooms have not been updated since the 80's. They were however clean, except the mold hanging from the vent in the bathroom! The kids were disappointed they could not hook up Gamecube or DVD to t.v. because it was so old it did not have the imputs for newer devices! We were looking forward to using the hotel pool, but when the kids seen how small it was, they did not want to use it. I am not kidding, it was the smallest pool I have ever seen. It was the size of the \"kiddie\" pool at most places. The mattresses left me very sore. The kids complained that they could feel the springs in the sofa bed. We travel a lot and this was the worst hotel we have stayed at in years.

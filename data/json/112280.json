We really wanted to be close to the beach, boardwalk, bike rentals, restaurants and nightlife and were had that at the Surfer. The staff were excellent - including Carlos the driver who can be found in the lobby most days :) We didn't rent a car, as this part of our trip was mostly intended to be at the beach, along the boardwalk and surfing - when we did want to venture off the beach area, we used Carlos. Best best place for breakfast is north along the boardwalk about 0.5mile to Kona's at the base of Crystal Pier - usually a line up, but good inexpensive food. Best place to rent bikes is right across from Kona's. Check-in staff provided lots of good tips and some discounts at various restaurants - Fat Fish was a great recommendation with the best fish taco's!

First off, it is in a great location and does have some nice views. The beds are very nice and the updates are pretty nice. Pool is well kept and was never crowded. However...Although our room was quite large, it had a spectacular view of the roof above the restaurant as well as it's air conditioning unit and giant exhaust fan that looked like it had survived many wars. So what am I saying? Make sure when you make a reservation that you specify to be away from the street/restaurant side. Very, very noisy and ugly unless you look around/past the roof. Especially in the morning when the delivery trucks show up. Also, since our room was on the end by the stairs, we had no front side window, like most other rooms, to get any kind of cross draft to cool the room down. Luckily they provide a fan that moved a little air but more importantly, drowned out much of the street noise. It did, however, help all of the stale cigarette smoke from all of the other guests, flow in. Good god! It felt like we were the only ones not smoking on the balconies or around the hotel. I was going to say something but since the employees were headed out for a smoke too, I thought better than to bother them. Another very important note. It is never a good sign when one of the cleaning staff warns you to smell the towels first to make sure they have been properly cleaned. She knew we had kids and , \"did not want them to get sick.\" Not good. It became a joke with us to \"name that stain\" on the towels. Many had one kind or another. They also could never seem to quite get the quantity correct. Oh, and lets not forget the tiny \"cave\" shower with the shower head at chest level, and I 'm only 5' 9\". Or that they did not clean or change out the coffee mugs. We did not have cereal in the room, but we stepped on some:) All in all, a fair hotel at best.

Checking in was a chore, and when we got into the room, there was no power cord for the alarm clock. Not a big deal, but I went down to the lobby to ask for one. I never got one. They were helpful in giving directions for the local busses (to get to downtown San Diego) though. We had to get the bus, as the carpark was so packed, it would've been a major gamble to take the car out of it (already having paid $12 for a pass) and risk not getting back in. Our room had no air con, and instead had a portable fan (marked \"301\", obviously in the wrong room - I wonder if the people in 301 had nothing?) which was actually OK. The TV hardly had any channels on, and there was no hairdryer. They did arrange the towels like a little man, with black stickers for eyes though (see photo...) It's worth mentioning, the stairs up to the rooms are pretty grim and seemed to be suffering from some sort of leak when i was there, which combined with the fact that there was barely any lighting made them fairly lethal.

Believe me, there aren't many hotels in San Diego that are like that!! Let me try to explain the room locations, as some have commented about this. The hotel is L-shaped. Any room 2nd floor or above has an ocean view -- if your room is in the lower digits (e.g. 301, 405, 207 -- up to 09), you'll be looking straight out from your room/patio to the ocean.; in rooms ending in 11-15 you will find the ocean 90 degrees to your right from your patio. I think that there are one or two corner rooms with NO beach view at all - avoid them if possible.. The very low numbered rooms (esp. 01-02) DO look out over a restaurant roof (esp. the third floor), but those are really nice rooms, and you still have a great corner view of the beach, boardwalk, etc..! The rooms themselves are very nice 3-star accommodations; fairly roomy, always clean, and with a small refrigerator. Our rooms had a nce flat screen TV (with working remote), and an excellent shower. The pool and bar-b-que areas are also nicely maintained. Maybe the best part about The Surfer is that it's affordable; believe me, you won't find another hotel in S.D. that's rght on the beach (with a pool and ocean views) in this price range - and, as other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel's location is not only on the beach, but in an area with plenty of restaurant (and bar) options. What I REALLY don't understand are those reviewers who have complained about the desk staff. To me they all seem friendly, fun, knowledgable, and eager to help -- and they all speak excllent English (I have no idea where the compaint about \"non-English speaking staff\" came from - unless he was referring to the maids.) When my car wouldn't start, one of the staff gave me a jump with his own car and jumper cables! If you can't get along with this staff, YOU have a problem!! A few restaurant suggestions within easy walking distance: World Famous -- ask for a table on the boardwalk window and enjoy geat people watching. Very reaonable prices for breakfast and lunch. Good bar as well. The Eggery -- Excellent breakfast place, but no view at all! Nick's at the Beach -- Nice neighborhood restaurant. Upstairs bar. P.B.

You have to pay for parking, which I thought was higher then the rest of the parking places. The pool was cooler than I expected and always had ducks swimming in it, so I chose not to use. The view from the balcony was okay, I was on the third floor, I overlooked the roof top of the restaurant, and it wasn't pretty. Definitely ask for the 4th floor. The vents for the restaurant were directed at our room, so we constantly had the grill smoke and exhaust coming at us....at times it got overwhelming, especially early in the morning for the breakfast crowd. The ice vending machine was out of the way, and to use the door to this and the pool and the beach you had to use an access code, not the room key card, which I kept forgetting the number code.

Don't be fooled - with the exception of a paint job, some new Ikea furniture and paintings from Target, this is the same place as before. My girlfriend dreaded taking a shower at this hotel.

The best part of the rooms is not what is inside, but what is available just outside. At night we slept with our sliding glass door to the balcony open and fell asleep to the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. Luv it! Of course, there are a few fall backs to the place. The rooms are not very big, but they serve their purpose. The rooms have been updated in style, although one can tell it is still an older building. Also, one thing I was shocked by was the fact that all of the rooms have exterior entrances. It is not a Hotel where the only access is from the inside only, it is a Motel with outside entrances.

I went this hotel based on the glowing Trip Advisor reviews. The difference between what I'd read about the place and what I found in reality was huge. The place was basically a tacky motel, albeit in a great location. The room, which faced the dumpster on an alley, was mediocre with bare, dingy walls. The beds were sort of gussied up, which helped a bit. The bathroom was ridiculous. It was tiny, with no tub and the tiniest little shower stall that made showering a truly unpleasant experience. Worse yet, the bathroom door was warped and did not close. Didn't even come close to closing. Given how much we paid for the room, I was pretty shocked at how tacky it was. I have never before paid so much for so little, and I've done my share of traveling. The walls were thin. This is a big problem when one's 11-year-old starts asking why she's hearing moaning and rhythmic thuds on the other side of the wall. Enough said about that...

I wanted to find a place on a beach for the first night, then we would move downtown for the second. I looked at a lot of options but hotels in San Diego tend to be very expensive. Priceline wasn't a good choice as there was no way to guarantee we'd actually be on the beach. Tripadvisor can be a wonderful resource in situations like this. I was at the end of my rope, almost ready to just give up on the idea of staying on the beach, when I decided to start from the top and work my way down the list, seeing if anything might work on our budget. I was a little nervous about booking this place; it seemed sort of odd. And it is odd -- in a decidedly good way. You get the sense that someone purchased what must have been a fairly shady motel on the beach and dumped an incredible volume of money and effort into making it something quirky and fun, without sacrificing quality or cleanliness. We booked a standard king room and requested a high floor with an ocean view. Not all views in this hotel are created equal. There are four floors and you really need to be on the top two to get a good view. But the view... WOW. From our balcony, we had an unobstructed panoramic view of the waves rolling in from the Pacific and a decent view of the actual beach itself. We watched the people of San Diego strolling by, walking dogs, surfing... plus the bonus of watching one of the best sunsets ever from our balcony. The rooms have been thoroughly renovated. Sinks feature granite countertops, rooms have brand new beds. Everything is decorated in this quirky, kitschy style. It really works. Wireless Internet access is available for $7.95 for 24 hours (SBC Freedomlink) and has a strong signal. There is also an $8 mandatory daily parking charge (up from $6 effective January 1) for access to the lot next to the hotel. Every booking site I checked had the same rate for this hotel, except one Southern California based travel agency whose website offered a 10% prepayment discount. We effectively got the parking for free by booking through them. You should be able to find the site if you search hard enough. Some reviewers have complained about particular features of their rooms. It seems that each room has unique furnishings. I would recommend calling ahead to let them know exactly what you need. They are very accommodating! Other reviewers have complained about noise on the weekends. We stayed on a Tuesday night and had absolutely no issues but I would believe it could be noisy on the weekends. The whole area is probably very noisy. It's quite popular. You might want to request a room at the end of the hall if noise might be a concern for you. One of the recent renovations has been to add custom fabricated privacy dividers between each room. It's still possible, because of the L-shape of the hotel, to see across the courtyard into other rooms, but the safety concern of shared balconies is no longer an issue. The place is not yet perfect. Some of the fixtures should be changed out. The elevator could use a little TLC. These deficiencies can be easily overlooked when you realize the value of the room quality, view, and attention from the outstanding staff compared to how little you're paying. They also make up each room with their signature \"towel bunny\", a sculpture made from artfully folded towels who welcomes you to the hotel.

The bathroom was clean and worked well. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and concerned. Parking was easy, but had an additional cost. I think we paid like... $36 for the week. There were many other advantages to being in this casual a hotel environment (for example, we stored our bikes in the room). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay during the week, but Friday night there was horribly loud partying in the room directly above us, until about 4 AM. It sounded like they were continuously rearranging the furniture, punctuated by occasional audible explosions of beer bottles being tripped over. At one point, I heard another guest yelling across the courtyard at them to shut up. The next morning, I spoke with the manager. To the hotel's credit, he gave me a discount for the night, and assured me it would not be allowed to happen again that night. He was genuinely upset that this had happened. Although the manager did what he could to remedy the problem, in the end we decided to go to a different hotel later that morning.

My husband and I are pretty laid back people so we're not that hard to please. We chose this hotel because of the reviews on this site. Initially we had a room on the fourth floor with a nice view. One big problem is with the balconies...there is no divider between the rooms so it's like one big open deck with no privacy. We had many people walking past our sliding door because they wanted to see the view at the end. If you want any light in the room in the daytime you need to have the curtain open, so people were able to peer in as they walked by. Also, there is no air conditioning so it gets fairly hot in the rooms. At night we would open our door to get some air in and leave the screen door closed. Well one night around midnight we were watching tv in bed and I heard our screen door open (it had no lock) as a big hairy arm reached into our room to push the curtain aside. I screamed and my husband jumped up to see who was coming into our room. A man was walking along the balconies and must have \"misplaced\" his room and muttered \"oops, wrong room\". Nice consolation for having my heart jump out of my chest! The rooms themselves are quite nice and the beds are comfortable. Although we had a king suite, it isn't all that large, and the bathrooms have absolutely no counter space. There were hairs on almost all our towels, but everything else seemed clean enough....that is until we noticed some kind of bedbugs in our room. We asked to be moved immediately, so with no apology and rude staff, we ended up with a room on the second floor (with barely any view) because the hotel was busy. The next morning we were awoken at 7am sharp with the sound of jackhammers underneath us. They were renovating the first floor...this went on every morning for the rest of our trip.

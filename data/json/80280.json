First of all, when you drive into this \"Inn\", it looks like a cheap motel. The parking area is poorly laid out and non-hotel guests are clearly taking up most spots (they don't ask for car info upon check in... we could have parked five cars and no one would have noticed). When you walk to your room, the concrete looks worn and the walls are not clean. When you get in, the room looks nice enough but oh no... the lighting is terrible, the shower is too short (and I am only 5'5\"), and the hair dryer was a rusted fire-hazard. On the shower thing again, my head was about two inches taller than the shower (see photos for this). Ah, and there was no shampoo or soap when we came in. We had to go request it. When it came time for the continental breakfast, there were only sweet pastries, waffles, sugary cereals available. There was nothing without sugar (wait, there was plain, cheap looking toast). No bagels, no hard boiled eggs, and no healthy cereal options. The juice was out of a metal machine which gives only watered down orange juice. Next, the milk. The containers to keep the milk cold were uncovered (they were in metal, insulated containers as are seen in coffee shops). Yes, uncovered so not insulated and open to the elements. Their fridge was available for anyone to get into and there were 6 gallons of milk, all expiring tomorrow (Saturday). Hmm... I wonder what milk they will be serving on Monday? The elevators are too small, clunky, loud, and slow. The one cart available for luggage is filthy and falling apart. Oh and the coffee was just awful tasting. Lastly, while my colleagues were out at meetings I decided to at least lounge by the pool to relax (after spending the night stressed about the disgusting hotel and morning unfulfilled by a terrible breakfast) until meeting for lunch. No such luck. They have a worker painting around the edges of the un-drained pool. Oh and if you have an iPad, don't bother trying to connect to their wifi.

Some of them were worse than the others. But this time I just had to write a review because I want to let others know about our experience. The receptionist at this hotel seemed to have mood swings so one moment she was very nice and helpful and the next she was rude and unfriendly. She was probably acting nice when the managers were around. We stayed at this hotel for one night. We made a reservation over the phone and when we arrived we asked the receptionist if we can see the room before we take it and she rudely replied: \"We don't do that.\" I wanted to see the room to make sure that the streets and the highway surrounding it were not too loud for me to sleep. But now we had to stay there or else we would be charged a cancellation fee. And if she nicely explained this to us, we would understand. Two other women waited to talk to her and she was also kind of rude to them. The room turned out to be nice and the cars were suprisingly not too loud. The room was clean and everything seemed fine, but it was not as nice as the rooms on the photographs. In the morning, at like 9:02 AM we called to see until what time breakfast was served, and the same girl answered and said: \"Until now.\" So we searched for their hotel directory and found out that it was served until 10 AM. We went downstairs and she seemed like she didn't want to deal with us, but she was being friendly to some other customers. So I complained that she told us that the breakfast was over, but it was still being served, and she just said something like: \"Well ... go eat it, you can eat it now.\" I would completely understand if she nicely said: \"I am sorry, but the breakfast is over at 9.\" And even if she made a mistake, she could have at least apologised. So I wrote a letter describing what happened with the receptionist and sent it to the manager of the hotel. I hope that he received it. As I said, hotel receptionists should make guests feel welcome. Their job is to handle guests' requests during their stay.

The hotel is very nicely kept up, freshly painted on the outside. The lobby is very clean. In fact, in my experience, the entire hotel was CLEAN, CLEAN CLEAN. The room was a little shabby, but as I said, very clean. My requirements for the hotel that we chose were: 1. Had to be CLEAN. 2. No mold. 3. No funny smells. And I was not disappointed in my requirements, although there were some funny smells when you ran the bathroom fan. If you ran it for any length of time, the bathroom smelled like smoke because we were on the corner and there were two smoking rooms on either side of us. Sort of a weird way to do non-smoking rooms, but whatever. The microwave did not work well. There was no rotating plate and I was afraid to use it. The sheets were clean, the blanket was pilled, and the bedspread had cigarrette holes in it, but they were very clean. The carpet was a little . . .odd . . . it felt funny under my feet, but it could be because it was old and the carpet pad had flattened out a lot. The air conditioner was very effective and very quiet. Didn't see any sign of mold, cockroaches or other vermin. In fact . . I know I keep saying this . .but everything was very very clean. The only glitch we encountered was that one day our room was not cleaned. When I called about this, I was informed that because we were staying for an entire week, they only cleaned your hotel room once. When I said, \"But they've cleaned it the last four days in a row,\" basically that was a bonus. If this policy is true, then I definitely would not stay in a place where they won't make your bed and keep it CLEAN no matter how long you stay there. But I asked them nicely to clean it the next day, and they did, and that was the last day we stayed there so it worked out. Everyone was very nice and accommodating, the staff is excellent. Because we booked early and were AAA members we got an excellent price: $593 for a seven-night stay. And yes that included taxes. We felt very safe in the room and the area. The room did start to get a little oppressive towards the end of our stay, because it was shabby, but the kids really enjoyed the cable TV during the evenings. We'd run around and wear ourselves out during the day, then come home and sleep, get up and fix breakfast and run out the door in the morning for a day of fun.

From the outside the place looked decent enough, with a smallish pool that seemed clean and pleasant. The lobby was nothing great but still decent. Then I asked where the restroom was and was given a key and told it was up two floors on the elevator. My daughter and I took the ride while my husband checked in. As soon as I stepped into the elevator I noticed the horrible smell. It reminded me of old musty apartments where people had a bunch of animals or something....not good. Then we get to the bathroom and unlock it only to find more nasty smell. Like I said it was a mixture of old yuck and animals and smoke. I hoped that this wasn't going to be the case with our room but boy was I wrong. On our walk to the room you couldn't escape the horrible smell, it was truly overwhelming. Sure enough once we walked into our room it got worse. It was the same smell with a TON of some sort of citrus cleaner over it. It actually burned our eyes and throat. At first glance the room looked okay but as I turned on more lights I wasn't impressed. The nightstands were literally covered in cigerette burns. All the furniture was marked up with black marks and dents and burns. Then I pulled back the bedspread and the sheets looked dirty and the bedspread and sheets both had a bunch of cigarette burns. Now the sheets weren't wrinkly or anything so they probably were clean but boy were they nasty looking. Onto the kitchen area I went. The microwave and stove and fridge were all okay and seemed fairly clean. The cabinets and counters were just old and icky looking. Like I said I am used to staying in places like days inn but this was just not what one would expect. It reminded me so much of really nasty apartments I looked at when I was younger! The bathroom wasn't nice by any means either, it wasn't the worst I've seen though. I guess I'd give it about a four out of ten. Maybe I could've handled this place if I were only staying for one night, but then I wouldn't need a place with a kitchen if I were only staying one night. We were to be there six nights but I knew right away that there was absolutely no way I was staying there that long. For one thing I didn't want to bring my clothes in and end up having all of our stuff stink. So for the first time in all my life we left in search of other lodging. We wanted to check out right then but it was the friday of memorial weekend and we were afraid we wouldn't find anything else. Luckily we did about 2 hours later. When we checked out the clerk didn't act suprised at all that we were leaving all ready (I'm assuming this sort of thing might happen a lot here). Then she told my husband she'd only charge him sixteen something dollars which was great. So overall I would definately say DO NOT stay at this place. I did notice however that as we were leaving the place was literally filling up with people. I just wanted to warn them all not to do it!!!! I guess to sum it up all I can say is that the place smelled like an old stinky bar with lots of dogs and it looked just as bad. All in all if it wasn't for the horrid smell I might've tried to stick it out but all together it was just not worth spending our vacation being grossed out by our hotel room.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDays Inn MV is in a great location!\u201d", "Author": "lydiafoster", "ReviewID": "UR3882501", "Content": "After reading about roaches and mold, I was a bit afraid, but found myself pleasantly surprised.

On the plus side, the kitchen (microwave, oven, fridge, sink) added a lot of convenience to our trip. The hotel grounds are quite beautiful, and very well kept, and the service was excellent.

The front desk worker was rude when I went in to correct the issue. It took 4-5 days for the money issue to be corrected, which affected my vacation spending. The bathroom ceiling above the toilet was leaking in our room, as well (room # 128). They stated that coffee makers would be available upon request, when one was requested, they said they had none available, but would send one up eventually. They never did. They also never informed us that there was a coffee maker available in the front lobby if we wanted to use that one. We opened our door to accept a delivery, to find police officers a few doors down, dealing with someone, and they began to look us over for no reason. That same room was also getting loud visitors whom repeatedly came around banging on the persons door and causing a scene, yelling about calling the cops. We asked the front desk worker about getting a taxi to the nearest Denny's, and were sent 4-5 miles out of our way, to find that there was another establishment much closer than that one had been. Maid service was very inconsiderate and ill-timed. We decided to extend our stay at the last minute, the front desk worker tried to charge $10 extra from the originally quoted rate. On the last night we paid for, he told us in a very rude tone that there were no more nights available after that night, and that the rates would change anyway. He also would not agree to give us the reciept we had requested, after we asked him numerous times for one. He said it would be 2 pages, and when we said that was fine, we wanted it anyway, he said that it \"wasn't necessary\" and refused it flat out. On one of the nights we attempted to pay for an additional nights stay there, the front desk worker refused to make change, therefore sending us to walk roughly 2 miles up the road after midnight, to the nearest gas station, only to find it closed, as well as every other store in the area. After the first night of our stay, HBO was scrambled on the TV and did not come back for the entire time we stayed there. The continental breakfast was not what we expected, the coffee was cheap, the pastries tasted days old. The whole experience ruined our vacation, the front desk workers were unfriendly and inconsiderate. We were very, very unhappy with our experience with the hotel.

The imminent threat of cockroach parties in the rooms and quicksand like sticky carpets that rob you of your socks had us ready to bail on our reservation. So like the sane reasonable people we try to be, we set up a contingency plan and proceeded forth to meet our doom. We arrived late, about 12:30 am. The doors to the lobby were locked and the person behind the glass doors instructed us to make our way around the night registration window in the underground parking lot. The service at the window was prompt, friendly and filled with the information we needed to find parking and our room quite easily. The facility itself was clean and seemed to be in good condition. As we walked to our second floor room we passed the well manicured pool area. While it was too chilly to consider swimming the pool was in good condition and the hot tub was steaming away ready for any who dare to dip. So now, the moment of truth. I slide the card key into its designated door slot and when the green light tells me it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time we slowly slide the door open to see\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

It was a clean large room with a king sized bed, a full kitchen, large bathroom, sleeper sofa, 27\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV, free HBO and a remote that was not nailed to the night stand. The carpets were clean, the room did not smell bad, and there were no roaches. It was a nice room. While I would not bring my Girlfriend there to propose or anything it is certainly a place I would stay again. We paid $41 a day and every penny of it was well spent. It was a good room, close to everything if you know your way around or have a map. The only thing I though was seriously deficient was the so called continental breakfast.

It's apparently been \"re-flagged\" (industry-speak for a change of chain, or lack of chain/independent) from another brand, and the makeover attempts were less than successful. A number of rooms are suites of the extended-stay variety, and the property seems to atttract a number of work crews on jobs in the area. The pool areas are pretty decent. Access to rooms is awkward, unless you're fortunate enough to snatch one of the handful of parking spaces under the motel's first floor, which has direct access to an elevator. Otherwise, you must climb stairs, or else traipse around to the ground-level parking entrance to get to the elevator. Rooms were clean, fairly roomy and generally in good repair, but still had that cheap look about them. Local phone calls cost 40 cents, plus a nickel for every minute over 15, so Internet access can cost; high speed Internet access is only in the lobby through a kiosk. The weeknight price is good, with welcome-center coupon books offering a $49 rate for one bed; two beds was ten bucks more. Desk staff was friendly. Location is pretty good, with major attractions about 10 minutes away; new San Diego Trolley extension, open in early 2005, is just across I-8.

We had a great room rate of $55.oo per night, however we had reserved that rate for a 2 queen bed suite and what we got was a king suite with a sofa bed.(which should have been cheaper). Kind of a pain to pull the sofa bed out every night for our kid to sleep in, not to mention it blocked off the path to the bathroom. I was extremely disappointed to find that there was not a coffemaker in the room, nor did they have one available. It did have a full kitchen which was great for TV dinners, although we had to go buy paper plates, etc. The room itself was dirty. The maid had vacumned near the entrance but not rest of the room, so you could see white papers on the dark carpet. Which brings me to the worst part, the carpet and tile floors in the kitchen and bathroom. Talk about filthy. The carpet is a dark color so you couldn't see the dirt but you could feel the stickiness if you were barefoot. It was so gross! The tile flooring was also sick and I ended up getting extra towels so I could use them as rugs on the floors so my shoes would quit sticking. On day 2, the maid again did not vacumn the entire room, only near the entrance. Also on day 2, The toliet began having problems flushing and by day 3 you could not flush it at all. The maid did not speak english so no luck getting a plunger. The Jacuzzi was cold, only about 85 degrees. When we checked out we were charged 40 cents for a local call, which we did not make. At the time the call was placed, we were at Sea World, so apparently the maid made the call while she should have been vacumning. Also, no fan in the bathroom, so when you took a shower, the steam buildup was awful, leaving everyting wet in the whole place, which only made the floor stickiness worse. The room was cheap, however, next time I'll pay $80.00 to stay at Travelodge or similar, I'll have a clean room, with good service and I will have a coffemaker in my roofridge anyway. It was really a dump, but it was cheap. I really think it was overpriced for how dirty it was...my feet turned black after one walk across the carpet. That was just the worst.

It was the halfway point of where we were coming from and where we were going, so we were all pretty exhausted and annoyed with one another by the time we arrived to the hotel (which was a little difficult to get to, being right off of a crazy busy multiple lane, seriously congested freeway with exits on both sides of the freeway *which is strange coming from a place that only has exits on one side*). When we checked in, the girl at the desk seemed a bit bored with the mundane details of her job (i.e. typing my surname into the computer and giving me the hotel key). She barely spoke English, which generally I didn't mind but I had a few questions I needed answering, and she was having a lot of trouble understanding me and vice versa. We got to our room, and was surprised by how clean, sizable, and comfy it was. The beds were stacked with the fluffiest, most delightful pillows, the beds were shockingly well put together, clean, and the sheets were soft. The bathroom was spotless (which is rare in a budget hotel), and everything was in fine working order. The free continental breakfast was surprisingly delicious, there were a ton of options, and everything seemed quite fresh and tasty. All in all, as stated in the title, you get what you pay for, and some little pleasant surprises. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's not a hotel snob looking for a decently priced hotel that's clean and comfy.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westminster colorado", "Title": "\u201cMassive amounts of maintenance needed and a good cleaning!\u201d", "Author": "clarence172000", "ReviewID": "UR89268194", "Content": "This hotel was cheap and the breakfast was ok (I'm not very discriminatory on any food any where).

I was, however surprised at the nice breakfast they provided - scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes, waffles, etc. The waffle machine was out of mix, so my husband had to go to the hotel's kitchen to find someone to help. He said the staff was just sitting around in the kitchen doing nothing. When someone did finally come out to refill the machine, my husband had to ask him to empty the trash, which was overflowing. There was a group there having breakfast together (they had their own breakfast buffet) and there were no signs to let regular patrons know that that buffet belonged to the group. You can imagine my embarassment when I ventured over to see if the other buffet had bacon and was told that I was intruding on the group's meeting! Also, as my husband and I ate breakfast, we had to listen to the group as they held their meeting (with a portable speaker/microphone).

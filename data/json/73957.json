I will start out by saying my arrival into Phoenix was rocky with my 2 day old iphone being stolen...but i put all feelings aside and enjoyed my phone free vacation! Checking in was a breeze, no lines, great service, we received complimentary bottled water as well as our room preferences. The resort is laid out in several buildings that are disconnected and have seperate parking lots but you can definetly walk from one end to another in 5 minutes! We drove around to find our building which has its own grand lobby and beautiful patio and pool area with swim up bar and waiter service. I was in the north pointe building in a 3rd floor room facing the pool, yes it is loud in the evenings when people are at the pool but with the TV on i could not hear a thing! and my balcony faced a quiet courtyard area with the sounds of a calming fountain! The king suite was very spacious with a large seperate living room with pull out couch and a seperate bathroom and sink area, large flat screen tvs with lots of channels, clean bathroom and floors. I inspected it vigorously as i have a crawling baby. The best part was the french doors that seperated all 3 spaces from each other so you could be in the living room without disturbing anyone in bathroom or bedroom. The fridge wasnt cooling properly and my precious milk spoiled, i called up to the lobby at almost 11pm and they sent someone with a new fridge in less than 5 minutes! Same with towels, i requested 6 extra towels and i received it right away! The food at the north pointe pool was much much better than the waterpark, we ordered almost every item off both menus so this is an accurate representation. We ate at Rico's at the breakfast buffett most mornings, no lines, great service, delicious food, the croissants were to die for! One morning i had a spa appointment and grabbed food to go at the \"starbucks\" cafe and although my muffins were delicious it was ridiculously expensive $30 for 2 muffins, 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 bottles of juice! You are better off spending $32 for 2 adults to eat in the buffett! By the way kids 3 and under eat free! The waterpark food i hated but they made the mixed drinks very strong and good! We walked to Aunt Chiladas and had great service...i wont comment on the food cause i am from texas and anything besides tex-mex just doesnt taste good to me...i shoulda known better. Waterpark was amazing...its not a waterpark per say just a collection of a large pool with waterfall area, baby pool, large slide pool, medium sized pool with basketball and volleyball and lazy river. There was also mini golf to the side, you pay one time $5 to play or a $2 per day resort fee for unlimited play. All the pools have towels! There is also a playground and if they are not in session they will allow you to bring your kids inside camp coyote and play in a room full of toys, disney movies playing on the large screen, a puppet theater...perfect for the under 4 yr old kids who could not otherwise attend camp and wake up early and get hot in the playground. There is also a public park by Aunt Chiladas you can walk to and play at. The spa was amazing, i had the best massage and wonderful service there as well! The concierge was very helpful in booking spa appointments, tours to sedona and grand canyon, discounts at rawhide for the kids. Location was great, chinese restaurant that delivers quickly across the street as well as a sports bar type restaurant, there is also a bank of america bank and atm across from the lobby down the street minute drive there is a walgreens and fast food restaurants the airport was 9.2 miles away, 15 minute drive Scottsdale was 12 miles away Rawhide was 25 minute drive One day was rainy and cold so we drove about 8 minutes out to Jamba playland an indoor carnival for kids which was also amazing and so fun for them with cheap carnival food for us to keep our mouths busy with. If you force me to have one complaint, it would be...the wifi is terrible...dont bother paying for it cause it did not work...go down to the lobby and wifi is free there or you can use the business center computers. I asked for a refund of my wifi charge and it was given to me no questions asked. I was there for 4 days and i would have stayed for 2 more if the airlines didnt have change fees, it was so much fun, perfect for me and my family, perfect location", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGood for the Kids\u201d", "Author": "Pixtonian", "ReviewID": "UR128190702", "Content": "I was in Arizona for school but my family and kids came down and went to the resort.

From start to finish our stay was just perfect. The staff at this resort could not have been more accomodating or professional. We stayed in a 1 bedroom/Queen bed suite which fit our family of 5 comfortably. The layout of the rooms allowed enough space for all of us to move around, while still allowing everyone their \"personal space.\" The resort pools were clean and inviting and were open late every evening, which is a nice change from other hotels that I have stayed at. The waterpark was small, but had enough pools/slides to entertain my children (ages 2, 10 and 12) for all the 6 days that we were there. The only problem I found was that there were not enough chairs in the River Ranch to accomodate all of the guests. If you did not wait in line at 8am to save your chairs, then you pretty much were out of luck finding one. One day I decided to go the the park at 8:45am to find some chairs. I found 1 chair at this time with no towels or belongings on it. I asked EVERYONE in the surrounding area if that 1 chair was available. A nice gentleman and his wife said \"No ....Nobody has that chair. It is free for you to take.\" Well, I decided to go back to the room and get my 3 children to come back to the waterpark with me so that we could all share that ONE chair. When we arrived...2 year old in tow....A nasty woman popped up out of her chair and yelled that we \"Took her chair.\" When I tried explaining that nothing was on the chair, she proceeded to tell me that she came at 8am to reserve 5 chairs and that that chair was HERS! I am just grateful to the kind woman from afar who saw what was happening and intervened. This woman tried to comfort me and did state \"I know how ugly it can get out here.\" I did not want my anger to get the best of me, so I decided to be the better person and walk away from the situation. It may have ruined a few hours of my day, but I wasn't going to let it ruin my stay. I called management about it, and they were extremely understanding and supportive. As far as the restaurants available, I felt that there were a variety of choices at the resort. We ate at the cabana and the Hole in the Wall restaurant most days, and were very satisfied with the selection and quality of the food. They also have room service available, and if you wanted a quick breakfast/coffee in the morning there is a Starbucks located in the gift shop. This area opens up at 6am. One morning my 2 year old was crying that he wanted \"milk\". At 5 am I walked out to the lobby to see if the gift shop was open. It was closed, but a nice gentleman (?maintanance worker) went out of his way to find me a cup of milk. Again, the staff could not have been nicer. On Easter morning, we had a local florist make Easter baskets for our children and the hotel had the Easter bunny come to our door to pass them out to my children. What a great touch! I thank the concierge for the recommendation of the florist and Easter basket idea. Even as we were leaving and several items could not be packed into our luggage, the concierge sent someone from shipping (Brad) to take care of the items and ship them to our home within minutes of our departure. We will again be visiting family in the area next year, and will definitely be staying here again!!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City", "Title": "\u201cNickel and Dime Resort\u201d", "Author": "Matt M", "ReviewID": "UR127996304", "Content": "Things have certainly changed at this place in the last year! This was our return visit to the Hilton Squaw Peak for 2012 Spring Break. Our trip started out with the front desk botching our room selection. Once that was resolved, we parked our car near the South Pointe tower entrance so that we could use a luggage cart, as there were four in our party for a five day stay. We then noticed that the two luggage carts were locked with cables to one of the pillars. Seriously? When asked if we could use one, we were told by a staffer, \"No, we don't use use those anymore because guests left them everywhere\". I was a little stunned to say the least. Nevertheless, we all got our excercise hoofing our luggage up to the third floor. We chose this method after waiting forever for the aniquated elevator. The second day was met with more disappointment. Both my wife and I have strong family ties to the area, and a few adult members of our family were coming over for a visit. We asked the front desk if they could sit with us poolside while my children were using the pool. They said of course, for a $15 per person fee! I explained they wouldn't be using the pool, and that they were only coming to visit with us, but that didn't seem to matter. The idiot at the front desk actually told me that \"they are like Disneyland, and that you pay regardless of whether or not you use the facility\". I thought the comparison to Disneyland was absurd and extremely unprofessional, and was completely out of line. Since both my wife and I are from the Phoenix area, we made good use of our time and knew some of the other activities that made the time there tolerable. The waterpark area is great for the kids, but as others have stated in there reviews, lounge chairs and fast service is hard to come by!! As a frequent Hilton guest, I was extremly disappointed with this stay, and hope this was just a bad, one-off experience. A change in management would do this resort very well. Not worthy of the 4-star rating in my eyes and the last time we will stay here.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sicklerville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cJust Ok\u201d", "Author": "fligster", "ReviewID": "UR127981246", "Content": "My wife, son (7) and I stayed at the Hilton for 4 nights over Easter weekend. We arrived around 3:30 and check-in was quick. They give you your room information and then you have to see the someone else to provide directions to your room, which is strange. Our room was in the main building on the second floor. The room was a 1 bed room suite and was an ok size. There was a sofa bed, coffee table, chair, tv stand, desk and little counter area in the living room. There was a mini refrigerator and there was a safe in the cabinet under the television. The living room was a little cramped when you had the sofa bed out. The bathroom was split between a room with the sink and another small room with the toilet and tub. These rooms were on either side of the entry to the bedroom. There were 2 sets of doors so you could close the doors between the bedroom and the bathroom or the living room and the bathroom or both. There was a small balcony with 2 small chairs and a little table. We only used this area to spray on sunscreen. The air conditioner was always running but the room never got really cool, and the air never shut off. There are pools at each building area, but also the River Ranch area where they have the larger pools, lazy river, slide, grille etc. This area was nice, but definitely did not have enough chairs or space for the people at the hotel. If you went down after 9:30 in the morning, you couldn't find a chair to sit on. The lazy river is large for a hotel pool, but was too lazy. It didn't seem to move at all. My son did like the pool and slide. One good feature of the hotel was the Coyote Camp, where you could have your kids go for half day or full day camp. There is an extra charge, but my son enjoyed it. They made crafts, went swimming and learned about the desert and the area. All of the staff there were extremely friendly and helpful. One disappointment was the \"nature walk\" which actually took place in the parking lot. Areas of the hotel are spread out over the property, which is ok except they do not have the property designed well for walking amongst the areas. You have to do a lot of walking through parking lots without sidewalks and walkways. There is a small gift shop with a Starbucks in the lobby.

After all the glowing reviews here, I probably had unrealistic expectations about this resort, but came away fairly disappointed, and can't really see coming back. The property is pretty and fairly well maintained, although clearly some of the buildings are older. The rooms were reasonably well updated, and the high-end toiletries were a nice touch. The fitness center was excellent - I am usually disappointed with resort fitness centers and this one is one of the best I have seen. There is some confusing information about whether they charge for it or not - they told us we had free access as Hilton Honors members, but they didn't seem to be charging anyone. The first source of disappointment was the waterpark - the main pool is much smaller than it appears in the photos on the website, and even with the other smaller pools, the pool areas are simply not big enough to accomodate the number of guests during peak periods - and forget about trying to get a chair if you are not waiting at the gates when the waterpark opens. That being said, the kids still enjoyed the pools. A second pool-related issue is that the waterpark closes at 8 PM, but the smaller courtyard pool is open until 11 PM. If you get a room overlooking this pool and do not want to hear people shrieking in the pool until 11 PM, I recommend asking for a different room. I wish we had. The food situation is what put us over the edge of not wanting to return. A resort this size should have more restaurant options with a greater variety of choices than is available. The poolside options are fine - burgers, etc. The service poolside ranged from extremely helpful and attentive to barely acknowledging our presence when we went to the bar for drinks. Sit down restuarants were terrible. Hole in The Wall, which they described as their signature restaurant offered more burgers and such, plus chili and barbeque options, which may have been reasonably tasty if they had been served hot. There is another sit down restaurant on the property which sounded like it might have more high end / healthy options. After wandering around for 20 minutes trying to find it with the confusing signs, we discovered that it was closed on Sunday, leaving the only dinner options on property more burgers and barbeque, which we found unacceptable.

There is a small coffee and baked goods store inside the lobby which is handy (see below). Parking is free but can be hard to find a spot at night. The negatives: Its location is not ideal i.e. nothing around it. The layout is sprawling with two larger buildings and a bunch of villas/townhouses. To get to the Ranch you have to trek across a parking. So depending on which building you are in, that could be an issue especially with small kids in tow. The appearance of the buildings, from the old depressing yellow color to the exterior corridors: does not feel like a true resort. Maybe a personal preference, but it just did not look like what I would expect from a Hilton resort. The lobby was very plain vanilla and not very inviting. Overall, the place looked like a very upscale Holiday Inn but not a Hilton.. The first night, we asked for extra bath towels which after 90 minutes and three phone calls, we never got and gave up. They charge for internet per device. Not an issue if you have a 3G type phone.. But charge for internet per device?? Really cheap... Morning wake up was with unavoidable noise of other kids running around in the outside halls; gardeners' leaf blower machines; and large trucks (garbage? deliver?) The main restaurant is in a detached building and about 100 yards from the main lobby, requiring walking thru a parking lot again. Not a big deal for us but would have been if the kids were smaller and it was hot or raining outside. Not a proper setup at all. As mentioned, there is nothing around the hotel so you have to either eat there or drive somewhere..

The King Studios are a bedroom of the casita that is blocked off when the whole casita is not booked. They do indeed have a king bed. Unfortunately, the bed takes up almost the whole room. You have about 4 feet of space on each side of the bed and at the foot of the bed. And then there is a wall-mounted flat screen TV. However, if it was placed at the end of the bed like they are in most hotel rooms, you would smack into it getting up to use the bathroom in the dark as it protrudes from the wall. Instead, it is on one side of the bed. Great for those times you want to spoon your honey while catching Sportscenter! A major portion of the tiny closet was being used to store an old and out-of-service mini-bar, the carpet was old, worn, and needed to be replaced, and the shower spit out large globs of water that could put your eye out if you are not cautious. I\u2019ll have to say the bathroom was spacious. It also had a great view of the neighbor\u2019s patio. We first discovered this when we first walked into the room and a small boy was peering through to see who his new neighbors were. The next day we peeked out to see grown-ups sunbathing about 15 feet from our commode. What a great way to encourage people to meet and get to know their fellow vacationers! There was also a mystery door in our studio. It appeared to lead onto the above mentioned patio, but it was locked from the other side. It turned out to be an interior stairwell directly into the downstairs of the casita in which another family was occupying. This was confirmed by the noises of children at play traveling up the stairwell, through the door, and into our studio. Despite getting a steal of a deal (with tax over $200 per night), immediately upon arriving to our room we decided we would spend a few extra bucks in order to have room enough to bring our luggage in with us. However, the front desk unsympathetically told us they were sold out, but we could check back on Friday (it was Wednesday when we arrived) to see if something opened up. I refrained from showering and using the bathroom without the shade down (maybe we would be moved to another room at our neighbors request?) and we instead checked out a few days early and went to another resort. When we left early, the front desk rep again was not too concerned about our experience. We requested that we be given some sort of break on our bill, and he reluctantly took off 30% off of one night. Nice, but hardly enough to make up for our disappointment and inconvenience.

Fortunately Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak fit the bill perfectly. First, the location. You are 20 mins from the airport (take the 24th street exit instead of the 44th street exit when you leave), you are tucked back against the beautiful Squaw Peak which provides some awesome views and hiking for any visitors wanting to experience Arizona. You are also in a nice part of town; along the bottom side of Squaw Peak and right side is Paradise Valley and you are only 20-25 mins from Scottsdale / Old-Scottsdale if you want to do a day of window shopping and eating at great places (or head to Fashion Square mall). I can't express the convenience of this location enough; you will need a car, but you have access to everything you came to see (Have kids? Want to go to the Zoo? 20 mins!) within 20-30mins away. Ok, now about the property... The Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak has been at that location for a *long* time, 20+ years. It was built as an oasis into the side of the mountain with a big sprawling property, a giant meandering pool. A lazy river. A mini golf course. Tennis courts. Basketball. A small mock \"Old West\" town for kids to play in... it is just a huge/fun property that sprawls out in every direction. You have rooms in the main lobby then you have Casitas and larger living arrangements on the outskirts of the property. Everything is easily walkable. While some aspects of the hotel rooms have been upgraded (like the bathrooms and bedding) other aspects of the rooms definitely still feel the same as they were in the 80s. We had a really nice big suite with a huge living/sitting/social area and the table was straight out of an 80s movie with all the wear and tear you would expect for 20 years of sitting in a hotel room. I think Hilton made the decision to incrementally upgrade the property by redoing all the bathrooms (the most important) then the bedding areas and then slowly doing touch-ups on the lesser details in the rooms like the older couches or tables. Honestly though, everything was clean and comfortable so it didn't bother any of us (and I tend to like nicer things). A few of the families got one of the big 2-story casitas on the property so we got to spend time inside those as well; they were comfortable and clean (Again the bathrooms and bedrooms were new; flat screen TVs, new beds, new counters, etc.) and the living room felt a *hair* older but again, not a big deal at all. Everything was clean, there were no issues with feeling the couches were \"Gross\" or anything like that. The kitchenette was a small/typical kitchenette which worked perfectly for those families; full fridge was a boon for left-overs and microwave was great for the kids for late night popcorn parties. The weather in December (if you haven't been in AZ before) is a gift from the heavens and is why people winter here; warm sun on your face with a nice dry 60-70 degree breeze is heaven; we ate outdoors at the restaurant on the property and were very happy with our food and the ambiance out on the patio was beautiful. TIP: Visiting this property in the off season (December) is awesome. It is like having a small-town theme park to yourself. The help told us that in the summer (the on-season) it gets SO PACKED that you are shoulder-to-shoulder outside at the pool/mini-golf/lazy-river area which honestly sounded so horrible to me I would have checked out and left had we been there in the summer. Keep that in mind; one of the reasons we all had such an awesome time is because we went in the dead of December (2nd week of Dec) and had most of the place to ourselves and our huge family.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima, Per\u00fa", "Title": "\u201cNice water park\u201d", "Author": "CarlaRJ", "ReviewID": "UR126833056", "Content": "Is a big and nice hotel with beauty desert and mountain landscape.

However, this ended up being for the better, as the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort exceeded my expectations in many areas. First off, this resort is designed with the \"old-school\" layout in mind - a sprawling property requiring the use of many a golf cart by hotel staff members. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this, but if you're expecting to walk in the lobby, hop on an elevator, and walk 50' to your room, you may be slightly disappointed. My suite was located in the \"North Pointe\" area, which was a considerable distance from the lobby, restaurant, and fitness center. However, this wasn't an issue for me. The suite itself included a living room area in front (with a sofa, chairs, desk, and flatscreen HD TV) and a bedroom area in the rear (with two queen-sized beds, nightstand, walk-in closet with ample space, yet another flatscreen HD TV). The living room and bedroom were separated by the bathroom in the middle. The bathroom was 'split,' with the toilet and shower located separately from the sink/mirror/counter area. The room was very nice, with plenty of space to spread out. The beds were comfortable and clean, and the bathroom was adequate. I did not visit the water park area of the resort, but I did make it to the fitness center. By hotel standards it was quite large, with plenty of treadmills, free weights, and machines. I would definitely recommend this property, not only to families looking for a kid-friendly resort, but to business travelers alike.

Both times we have stayed in a King Suite in the main building. This is a very large resort with many room options including casitas for larger families or groups. It is a bit of a walk to things...restaurants, pool, etc. It's really not much of a problem since the grounds are beautiful and there is something to see around every corner. The room layout was nice. Living area with pullout sofa. Bathroom itself was small but the sink area was separate so that opened things up a bit. There is a door between the bathroom area and the living room area as well as a door between the bedroom and the bathroom area which is nice for privacy and noise reduction. There is a main pool area and then pools by the buildings.The \"small\" pool in our area was a nice size with jacuzzi. We didn't have time to use the pool but lots of guests did. The pools are all heated. The main pool is amazing and very family friendly. They have \"Dive-In\" movies by the pool for kids and families on Friday evenings. Nice touch for the kids. There is a wonderful fire pit in the pool area. However it gets very crowded so getting a seat is tough at times. The Hole in the Wall Restaurant is in the pool area. Good, friendly service but food left quite a bit to be desired. Rico's American Grille is open for breakfast. Breakfast buffet was average..service a bit slow. There is also a gift store with a starbucks inside which served breakfast to go. It was always extremely crowded but offered quite a bit of variety if you didn't mind the wait. All that being said, this is a nice resort but there were a few things that were a bit annoying. Wifi...as Hilton Honors Diamond members we receive free Wifi. The Wifi signal was HORRIBLE. Again this was a large property and I'm guessing the demand for wifi was very high. There were times that we couldn't even log onto the wifi or stay connected if we were able to get on. It was faster to just use the 3G on my phone to look things up if I needed internet. If you have to pay the fee for the Wifi there I would definitely think twice about it. It was annoying enough when it was free, I can't imagine how annoying it would be it I had to pay a charge for it per day! Phone service.....I have a Sprint phone. My husband has a Sprint personal phone and a Verizon business phone. Our Sprint phones had very little or no signal the entire time. When I was in the bedroom area...the phone was roaming. Moving to the front living area brought a bar of service. 3G was off and on....mostly off. My husband's Verizon phone had a good signal and he didn't have any issues with the 3G wireless card from Verizon that he has for his laptop. Just something to keep in mind if you have a Sprint phone! Noise level.....as with any hotel that offers suites, it draws families. Add the fact that this particular hotel has a wonderful pool area and it was spring break when we were there and it draws families and large groups. It was just my husband and I on this trip so for us it seemed really loud. The small pool was in the middle of the suites and was always busy. The main pool closes at 8:00 PM and people move to the small pools which are open till 11:00 PM. The sound really carries between the buildings. We were able to close the doors between the bathroom area and the living area and block most of it out but it was noticeable. When we arrived, they were having a birthday party just outside the lobby area and you couldn't even hear to check in. It was a weekend and the noise level went down once Sunday evening came so maybe it was just the weekend, spring break, lots of kids, all of the above that worked together to make it extremely loud.

The \"water park\" was really just multiple pools with various activities in them (waterfall, volleyball net, etc), there was one water slide and a lazy river (which was so lazy the kids wanted out). There was a nice eating area/bar with a ton of variety but very overpriced ($8.75 for a bloody mary in a 12oz plastic cup). The package included dinner at one of the restaurants. They lost our reservation but quickly arranged for us to be seated anyway. To our surprise the dinner was a buffet, which was not mentioned in the advertisement. It wouldn't have been bad execpt there were not a ton of child-friendly options. Me and my husband had the steak (yes, served on a buffet) which was terrible. They had some activities going on in one room of the hotel which was I assume the remainder of what they offered for their New Years celebration but we did not attend, at this point we were happy to go back to our room and watch movies. But when we got back to our room we noticed very loud music coming from behind our room. We couldn't see well enough to know what all the commotion was from but we thought it was part of the festivities that would end at 10 (according to the package deal). At 1:00a.m., when it still hadn't stopped I called the front desk to see if there was anything that could be done about this. They said they would notify security and couldn't even tell me what was going on there. Nothing was done and the music didn't stop until after 2:00a.m.! Turned out we were right next to a ballroom with a New Years party of their own going on. Needless to say, we got the worst night's sleep ever at a hotel. We got up early and left as soon as we could. We chose this place because they advertised a nice, low-key, family oriented New Years special that made it so our family could be together and we weren't out too late. What it became was a negative New Years memory. The hotel should have kept the families together and away from the obnxious parties going on around the hotel. We will not consider this hotel in the future during a holiday weekend, maybe not ever. Rooms were spacious suites with private patios or balconies which would have been wonderful if not for the blaring music. The room was clean but obviously an older hotel. Grounds kept nicely.

This was where our conference was taking place. When we first arrived, the hotel was remodeling their front entrance. We drove around for a while trying to find the \"temp\" main entrance, with no direction as to where it was. Rooms were nice, and clean. We were located in the North Tower. The room that we had was quite big. For a family I could assume it would be comfortable. We just had to MUCH room. Our room was on the top floor. No views. Our patio was overcome by a local tree. Which was fine by us. It kept us from looking at the parking lot. This place has a HUGE parking lot. You can get lost so be aware! The only problem I had with specific service (maids) was he/she would always leave all the lights on after they left. Also, there was no specific service for recycling. I did ask at the front desk about that, and they told me that I could go to their trash area which was behind the hotel on the South side and dump it there. They wouldn't even take it for us! When I found out that the movies on the TV that were provided by the hotel were $15.99 a piece I freaked out. Not very affordable. When I had first arrived I had scheduled a couples massage for my husband and I. When we checked in at the spa they told us that there couples massage was in completely different rooms. To which I replied, \"Then it's not a couples massage\". The massages actually turned out wonderful. I did mention to them that couldn't advertise a couples massage as such. They didn't really seem to take notice. I also received a mani/pedi in a different area of the salon and much to my dismay there was no one in the salon. No one. Just me and the nail tech. It was kind of lame. There was no art work on the walls, no music playing, no TV in the background. It was strange. The nail tech herself was a delight, but the place was just lacking in personality. The Business Center was a sham. I went in to check some email and print out a boarding pass. You had to pay to print it and you also had to pay to surf the interent. It was outrageous. I think it was like $3.00 a min. Not to mention they only had 2 computers and 10 min I was in there they kept asking me to get up and switch to the other computer cause they couldn't get the other computer to print. It was a nightmare. I felt so bad for the guy that was working there. He was trying to help me, had another woman yell at him cause she was upset about the boarding pass, a gentleman asking him why his computer wouldn't print..not to mention 2 phone calls that he had to take cause they were \"tech\" calls. It was pretty bad. So, last but not least the \"Waterpark\". They advertise on their website that they have 2 1/2 acres of pools and that is the truth. The pools, in my mind was really the reason to book a stay here. There was a \"kiddie\" pool, 1 main pool (which was quite large and has a waterfall), a \"sports\" pool, a water slide and a lazy river. I never entered the kiddie pool, and by the looks of it, neither did anyone else. The main pool was really cool. That was where I spent most of my time. They do have wait staff that are supposed to serve you out around the pool, however no one ever came to me, I had to seek them out and order something. The \"sports\" pool is a little smaller then the main pool. It's a little more subdued. They also have the \"lazy river\". Which was so lazy.. that you literally had to walk your inner-tube in the river to actually move. It wasn't really fun. I didn't try out the water slide. I had been told when entering the park that the slide was turned off, but if I decided I wanted to slide all I had to do was ask and they would turn it on. Weird. There was a hottub as well. The fitness area which was connected to the spa/salon also had it's own pool for working out. I went to that pool twice. It was nice because there were no children in it. Now, each section of the hotel the North and South tower had their own pools in the center of the building. Outdoors. My husband reminded me that there were these pools also, if I would like to try them. The one night I decided to try one out, I found between 50-60 people all sitting at tables around the pool having a catered dinner staring at me in my suit. There were no signs saying the pool was closed for an event or messages on our phones from the front desk. That was annoying. So, be aware before you head down to one of those pools for a night swim. By the way, because I had made an appointment at the spa for the massages and mani/pedi, I received phone messages all week from them stating their daily specials. So, beware!! If you are thinking about staying here for the waterpark, DO IT! It was a blast. If you are wanting a romantic/warm place to stay.

This is the first scathing review I have ever given. I hope I never have to give another. First I should say that I am a local and I have been to this resort several times. I even stayed there in a Casita on my wedding night a year ago and had a great time. The Casitas are dated but nice, the pool area and lazy river is great, and we had a great breakfast buffet in the morning. The resort itself is worth staying at. That being said, I went today with a few girlfriends for a spa day (we do this every few months) and had what was without a doubt the most miserable spa experience I have ever had. The spa itself is exceptionally small and there is nothing luxurious about it. I would consider myself somewhat of an expert regarding the local resort spas, and this one just lacked all the niceties of the others. The room where you wait for your service only has four small chairs for example, while every other spa I've ever been to had a large room with luxurious couches and pillows, etc. I wouldn't have bothered to complain about this in an online forum if it were not for the HORRIBLE massage I received. My massage therapist was really high energy; almost manic like, not calm and pleasant the way a massage therapist should be. I have expensive extensions in my hair and asked her not to massage my scalp. She laughed and told me she was going to touch my scalp anyway. I was totally dumbfounded and did not know how to respond. I spent the massage totally tense, especially when she was working my neck and shoulders in fear she was going to put her oily hands into my scalp and ruin my extensions. (She never did thank goodness, but she did have to ask me to relax my shoulders at one point because I was just so tense.) This woman had the worst \"touch\" I have ever experienced. She barely put her hands on me, very lightly caressing me but not massaging me at all. I considered asking her to go deeper (she never asked me how I liked the pressure) but she had what felt like warts on the inside of one of her palms that were scratching me as she touched me so I honestly couldn't stand the thought of her touching me any harder. The whole experience was so miserable. If felt awful, I was disgusted by whatever was on her hands and I almost asked her to stop twice because it was just so unpleasant. I managed to endure the whole thing only because of my fear of upsetting her. (I should mention that I did have a great facial a few hours later by a different lady who was awesome.) When I went to pay I was told there was a mandatory 18.00 tip per service. I had managed to not complain up to this point, but the fact that I had to suffer through the hour and pay for it at all was the most I could do, adding a totally undeserved \"mandatory\" tip was just more than I could manage. I shared my experience with the very young man at the desk who was totally ill-equipped to handle a customer service complaint. \"Well it wasn't supposed to be a deep tissue massage\" he said, not rudely, but just immaturely. I informed him that I have never had a deep tissue massage but have enjoyed dozens of Swedish type massages and I have never walked out significantly more tense and stressed than when I walked in. Clearly frazzled, he asked me if I would just please pay the required tip and he would have his manager call me. It was apparent that he was totally flustered and not trained to handle a complaint. I didn't want to give the kid a hard time so I just paid it and left. We shall see if I get a call from the spa manager but I don't know what they can do now to resolve the situation after they already charged me and required me to pay a large, very undeserved tip. Basically, this is an older but nice resort with some desirable attributes, but the spa is just absolutely horrible. Do not visit this spa for any reason. There are so many wonderful, pampering, luxurious spa resorts in the valley where you can get a fabulous massage AND fabulous service; there is just no reason to suffer at the Pointe Squaw Peak.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely Stay\u201d", "Author": "elledub", "ReviewID": "UR119278706", "Content": "I have to admit I was a bit nervous booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews.

Ingredients and selection are top-grade! *Complete refurbishment of the resort is nearly complete. The property upgrade was planned well as to be virtually transparent to the guests. *True HD television: so many hotels provide updated TV's while still feeding those sets with outdated (cheaper) analog signals. Pointe Hilton provides a wide variety of HD channel selections. *The in-house Audio/Visual team will help you pull off a successful meeting without a hitch!

Cons: *Limited restaurant selections off-property within walking distance. Grocery stores and services are close by, however. (about 1/2 mile) *Slow elevators: luckily, it's only a three-story complex. *Tap water was \"murky\" smelling and tasting. This is mostly the fault of the local water utility, but I hope Squaw Peaks Hilton would address this issue. Be sure and drink bottled water, IMHO. *Confusing to navigate on-site. It's a large property, and the North building is identical to the South Building. Be sure and get a map! *Luggage carts are locked up, forcing you to call for a bell-captain. Sometimes I just want to do it myself! *Annoying voice mail SPAM advertising: We would arrive back to our sleeping rooms to see the message light lit, just to find out the message was an advertisement for the Spa services! we have never experienced this in any hotel anywhere in the world.

The limited property maps are so faded that even with \"readers\" it was unreadable! Additionally - the service at check in terrible. First they didn't give a map of the property. When asked for one, they marked the wrong building and location of the room. (Which is why I know the property maps on the premise are unreadable since I was totally lost). Upon going back to the lobby they still could not tell me where my room was - even the concierge. Ask for a room above the ground floor.

As Hilton Honors Gold members we were upgraded to a Casita room and at first we were amazed at this room that was more like an apartment. Very quickly our amazement turned to disappointment. When we got to the room it was hot so we looked at the thermostat and saw it was actually on and was set to 72\u00b0. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided that they didn't turn it on early enough before we got there to cool off this huge room and turned down the thermostat a little more. I also noticed a slight cigarette smell when we walked in but nobody else in my group smelled it. I put it off as coming from the 3 extinguished cigarettes at our front door in the sand. Wasn't this supposed to be a non-smoking room? There was an upstairs bedroom but there was no place to put our huge suitcase. We ended up putting it on the landing at the top of the stairs on the luggage rack. There's a lot of drawers and cabinets to put your clothes in but I wasn't about to unpack our suitcase for a two night stay. No complaints about the upstairs bathroom which was huge, nor the kitchenette which included almost a full sized fridge and a sink. The dining and living areas were also huge, with plenty of room for us to spread out. Upstairs there was a balcony with an umbrella table and chairs and lounge chairs, must be nice when it's cooler but we weren't going to sit out there in 114\u00b0 temps. Coming in from the balcony I saw a cup by the door and found it was a cup full of smoked cigarettes in water, yuck. Again, wasn't this supposed to be a non-smoking room? Even the pool disappointed my children. They like to swim and frolic along in the lazy river but were told they HAD to be floating along in tubes, which got old for them very quickly. What is the reason for this rule? The lazy river at the Hilton near Disney World doesn't have that requirement, so I know it's not a safety issue. That scratched their fun. That evening, the room just didn't seem to get very cool. Even though we now had the thermostat set to 50\u00b0, it still felt like 90. It got a little cooler in the middle of the night while we were sleeping, so we just thought that if left on all day the next day, it would finally get comfortable. No. The next night it was even hotter! Even after a cool shower, nobody could fall asleep until about 3am, when it started cooling down.

The rooms face outside courtyard and/or pool areas, which can be a bit noisy at night, depending on which room you stay in. Didn't see much garbage within the hotel grounds itself. Had a really nice massage at the spa. The spa area itself is really nice, clean and updated. If you decide on staying at this resort, check out the daily specials at the spa! Now, onto the Hole In The Wall River Ranch waterslide/lazy river/main pool...I was very disappointed with the lack of cleanliness with this pool area. You could see the dirty \"bath-tub ring\" on the waterslide, which grossed me out. Most of the chairs were dirty and the pool area itself, was dirty. Our family had fun at the pools, no doubt, but, you just have to look past the filth. We just ran straight to shower after our time with pool area. Have to say, the Lazy River was relaxing and appeared a bit more clean. Next time we stay, I'd really like to check out a casita, which might make the stay a bit more comfortable with less noise.

In fact, from you room you can walk into the park by following streets, paths, and an equestrian underpass to get to the other side of the highway, but it's nicer to drive the 10 minutes to get into the main vehicle entry to the park, as it's quieter and you are more surrounded by the local desert.

Because of my HHonors status, I was upgraded to a Casita (like a private Villa/condo). I was so impressed with the room and resort that I flew my wife in the next day. Upon arrival, she was immediately greeted by Billy, the doorman/concierge. He took her to the casita via golf cart and then offered to take her on a tour of the resort. She thoroughly enjoyed the tour! The resort has many beautifully landscaped pools. The fitness center is well-equipped with high-end equipment. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the spa treatments she received by Bobbi and Holly. Everyone was so friendly throughout the whole resort. We spoke about the friendliness we experienced and determined the employees much really enjoy working there because they are always happy and willing to go the extra mile to help. We ate at Rico's for breakfast, which had a full buffet. Tim was our server, and gave us alot of good advice about Phoenix and the surrounding area. For the evening, we had in-room dining, and the the food was exquisite and delivery was prompt. My wife LOVED the cobb salad. River Ranch is an entertainment area of the resort. It features a large pool with a sports area (volleyball) and waterfall, lazy river, winding water slide, and a more secluded area around the back. Every day there are activities planned. In the morning, there is a stand outside the River Ranch area that features continental breakfast type food and drinks. Outside our casita, we had a really nice lap pool that also includes a whirlpool. There is also a putt putt golf area and nearby hiking. The Squaw Peak has such beautiful landscaping everywhere! There are a couple of small shops as well.

But, traveling with a small child I felt the available water activities and the 2-room suites would be best. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing spa or adult weekend, this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for great poolside service and fancy drinks with umbrellas, find another resort. As a Hilton Diamond Member, I am used to a level of service that this hotel does not offer. In fact, you will not receive anything special for being a loyal Hilton customer. So, Diamond members, do not look for a nice sit-down continental breakfast as it is not offered. Our two choices are to stand in line in the gift shop for dry cereal, and even drier donuts and coffee. Or, the other option is to pay for breakfast at the noisy and unorganized Rico's restaurant on-site. ROOMS: Our two-story king bed casita was very nice. It was clean and comfortable. I liked that we could park in covered parking right at the casita. The bed was comfortable and clean. The kitchenette, fridge, etc. were new and well-kept. Very nice room. Not five-star but nice. SERVICE: Checking in, we were greeted and received well. Quick service to our room. The restaurants and poolside service was terrible. None of the staff seemed interested in helping. Too bad because the hotel misses out on a lot of revenue from bar/alcohol sales. RESTAURANTS: Food was mediocre but prices were okay. Again, service was slow both before and after ordering. THE RIVER RANCH: This, and the other pools, are the hotel's saving grace. Our two-year-old had a blast. She loved the lazy river and the waterfalls. The pools were beautiful. They seemed manicured and the surroundings were also nice. Very nice. One complaint I read was that hotel guests were reserving poolside chairs and not sitting in them. We also noticed this but is something you must deal with at a large resort. Overall the resort is just okay. It depends on what you want out of your stay.

My kids loved the burgers at The Hole in The Wall, but my husband and I found the menu to be limited and pricey. The brunch at Rico's was great- especially because we had vouchers, but otherwise the menu also seemed a bit pricey and not very kid friendly. We loved Gallagher's which is a pub, walking distance from the resort- good food, reasonable price and the kids were happy. I heard the Italian Restaurant near by was excellent, but we didn't get to try it. We also got Take-Out a couple of nights to cut down on cost. David gave us menu's from the Conceirge desk. I highly recommend the Arizona Hummer Tour (www.azhummertours.com) Scott was our tour guide and he was fantastic! It was an experience my family will remember forever and well worth the price!

It's an old hotel in decent condition but completely lacking in style. The ceilings are popcorn, the furniture is a little worn, the \"balcony\" was concrete block...in fact, the whole place is just heavy concrete painted in bright colors. It feels like a huge motel. Our room was a hike from the lobby and parking lot. Everything is very disjointed. The pools are not anything to rave about and not even anything worth mentioning unless you've never been to another resort in your life. Near our room there was a \"sun deck\" that consisted of some bare lounge chairs facing a concrete wall on 3 sides. It was the most unappealing sun deck I've ever seen and it became kind of a punch line for the weekend. Again, I don't want my review to be too negative because there is nothing wrong with the hotel per se...it's just old and tired. It lacks any kind of style, vibe or energy. All the staff we encountered were OK. In my opinion, if you're a family from the mid west and you're on a tight budget and want some sun, this is a good option. If you want something new, interesting, \"resort-ish\", or with energy, either spend a bit more for the big resorts or spend less and just book a budget hotel near a big resort and get a day-pass.

The hotel is dated but has been well maintained and nice plantings on the grounds. I would call it quite nice - not fabulous - but nice. We enjoyed relaxing by the pool - the only annoying part was people putting out their towels to save their chairs by 7am and not showing up until late morning - but I guess that is resort mentality. The hotel has a pool for each of their two larger buildings which is nice because it was small enough to feel quaint, yet large enough to not feel too crowded. The \"water park\" is more of a water play area and has a nice lazy river, one slide, and a pool area - we felt it was geared for smaller kids so only used the lazy river and then headed back to our building's pool. With all the younger kids at the water play area, it kept the pool area quieter. As a runner, I found the hotel had two nice options for anywhere from a 3-6 mile run. About 1/2 mile from the hotel is a trail that runs along a canal and there are other runners and bikers so you don't feel alone. The other option I found was also 1/2 mile away, the Dreaming Downs park area with a nice path or even trail running. It is nice to find a place where you are not stuck running on the sidewalk beside traffic! The rooms were spacious and quiet. I liked having the toilet/shower separate from the sink area. You can also close off the bedroom and living room areas from the sink which is nice if there is an early riser. Overall we enjoyed our stay, the only negatives for our family was the crowded feeling by the pool area and people \"claiming\" their spots - but I imagine this might not be a issue if you stay during a non-peak time - and the other is the hotel not providing recycling containers by the poolside or in the rooms - you just throw everything away.

What we got was a gorgeous resort with the amenities, and service I associate with a more expensive price tag. We were able to do some incredible things (jeep tour, trip to sedona and grand canyon) because we weren't broke from the hotel cost. The physical site is aesthetically pleasing and well maintained with courtyards, fountains, tasteful art and decor with a sense of place. You can see beautiful squaw peak from the river ranch!!! Don't miss the lazy river at sunset--wow! The pictures don't do it justice! One caveat is that although I believe the whole resort is wheel-chair accessible, bare in mind that the various facilities ( river ranch, spa, camp, restaurants) are quite spread out from the suites and casitas. My family was fine with it, but I could imagine that anyone unable to walk a few city blocks would need to ask the staff for particular rooms or golf cart transportation to facilities. I'm sure they would be helpful! The service was outstanding. We got prompt service every time we needed anything: ketchup, extra towels, etc. Of note: Dave, the concierge, was upbeat and extremely helpful with all of our sight-seeing. He even upgraded us at no charge to a \"pure room\" when he heard that one of our children had allergies. The room was a two room suite with 2 queens and a pull out sofa with a balcony. The beds were delicious and the air did feel very fresh--not sure if it was the \"pure\" room, the dry desert air or both. The river-ranch was a blast and my kids really enjoyed a morning at cayote camp. Jane, the director is professional, loving and creative. In just 3 hours my kids brought home fired-clay bowties, decorated cowboy bandanas and excitement about what they learned about the desert flora and fauna. I wish they could have gone more--they got so much out of it. I had the good fortune of receiving a phenomenal deep-tissue massage at the Tocosierra Spa on site. I considered going to one of the fancy local spas, but decided to go here for convenience.

The back of the resort features all the water actitivities (lazy river, water slide, pools), as well as a \"Western\" village.

The hotel is not in the main resort area around Scottsdale. It is a large property in West Phoenix. The property is well kept--great large pool area and smaller pool areas around the property. The property borders on a nice neighborhood and just a few blocks away are easy hiking trails. The front desk staff overall was great as was the male concierge (the female concierge was not as helpful--didn't appear to know much) We stayed in a Casita--a one bedroom bi-level with a efficiency kitchen and a small living room/dining room. The furniture was fine if slightly dated. The kitchen, however, had nothing. No utensils, no glasses (except two water glasses you would find in a hotel room) and a couple of styrofoam plates and plastic silverware. There wasn't even a bottle opener and it took forever to get one. So unless you were driving to the resort or willing to go out and buy kitchen supplies, other than having a refrigerator there was no advantage to having the kitchen. Both restaurants were mediocore to poor. Breakfast was particularly bad. There are a lot better choices close by including for breakfast. The bad news was the last day. We had not checked out--only left the room--and came back to find that almost everything had been taken out of the kitchen. It was very clear we hadn't left. An angry call to the front desk and housekeeping eventually led to the removed items being located, but by then we were late to the airport. To top it off, because of the volume of checkouts we were told that receipts weren't printing. After a relaxing three days it was a hurried, stressful departure. We were promised by the front desk manager that we would get it by e-mail by the end of the day. We also understood there would be some adjustment to the bill. Five days later I contacted the front desk manager because we still had not received a receipt. When it finally arrived there was no adjustment. A further contact to the front desk manager went unanswered. I finally wrote to the general manager and had a quick response; apology, and more than adequate adjustment to the bill. Had we not had the final day experience I would easily have given this hotel a \"4.\" Assuming that what happened to us was a fluke I would still recommend the hotel--particularly if you have kids.

Sadly, our beloved Oregon Ducks lost to Auburn by a field goal... but you can't win everything, I suppose. We stayed in a two-room king bed suite, which was great, as it had two large 40-ish inch flat-screen TVs (one in the bedroom, and one in the living room area). I had brought my laptop and an HDMI cable, and I was able to watch videos directly from my laptop. There's a fee for Internet use, though, so I didn't stream Netflix or anything. We ran into one snag with check in. I had booked the Winter Escapes package that was being offered by Hilton, which includes breakfast vouchers each morning and a $50 resort credit. In full disclosure, I booked it at pre-paid rate on Hotels.com, but I checked my confirmation email to make sure that was indeed what I was to receive. After I checked in and got back to the room, I realized that I had not received the breakfast vouchers. I called the front desk and the woman who answered didn't seem to know what I was talking about. I told her that I had booked the Winter Escapes package and that my confirmation from Hotels.com clearly stated that it included the above perks. I even checked on Hilton's Web site before we left Oregon to make sure the package was legit... sure enough, I found it (with this hotel listed) here: http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/promotions/hi_winter/index.jhtml?cid=OM,HH,WinterEscape,Specials The employee said, \"I'll go ahead and do it,' which was nice... but, I'd rather have heard, \"Oh, yes, you're right... we have it right here.\" Same outcome... but I don't like the idea that I booked something, had a confirmation of it... only to be told, \"Well, we'll go ahead and do it\" as though I was being done a favor. I did appreciate that I didn't have to press the issue, but I would have preferred that it was just done right in the hotel's system in the first place. Oh well. It all ended well. And the breakfast at Rico's Grill (which was still listed by it's old name -- Lantana Grill -- on the breakfast voucher AND a wall map in the lobby, causing some confusion on our part... please fix this, Pointe Hilton!) was quite good. The voucher was good for the breakfast buffet or $16.95 from the regular menu. We tried the buffet the first day, and it was quite good, and included a made-to-order omelet station, pastries, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc. The next day, we ordered off the menu, and again... the food was really good. The temperature was around 65 F when we were there, but nice and sunny. This is pretty balmy in January when you're from the Pacific NW and used to rain and overcast skies in the winter. So, we headed over to the River Ranch water park for some fun in the lazy river. This particular lazy river is rather *LAZY*... in that there is not a lot of water pressure (at least not when we were there). But, we still had a fun time because we had the park *almost* to ourselves, as this was definitely an off-season for the hotel. There are several pools, a hot tub, a mini-golf course (which we didn't try), and lots of fun things. I'd love to see it in the summer time. The hotel itself also has a few pools and hot tubs, which would be great for those who don't want to walk over to the River Ranch. Parking was free and easy. We were able to park less than a minute's walk from our room each time without hassle. Wi-fi is free in the lobby, but not accessible from most (if any) rooms. Since wired Internet access was like $12 a day, I just used my phone while we were there, except for once when I brought my laptop into the lobby to access a company server for work. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel. It was in a nice area, close to Piestewa Peak for a lovely hike... there's a 24-hour Wal-Greens down the street next to a grocery store... and lots of great restaurants in the Phoenix area (My advice: head to North Phoenix for some Chino Bandido.

I walked thru a residential area and \"guessed\" a lot to get to the tunnel that goes under the freeway and up the mountain. I eventually found my way by asking a nearby apartment manager where I was suppose to go. The trail was nice and pretty easy, passed a few people walking their dogs.

The restaurants, bars, gift shops, coffee, etc was pricey but there are a lot of fun places to eat in the area so you don't have to eat there. \"The Hole in the Wall\" restaurant manager, Tammy, did assure us there would be gluten free options for Thanksgiving which was very nice. We went to the spa at the Intercontinental Hotel nearby, I think it is called Joy Spa. I have been to many spas and nothing tops this. After your massage there is a \"whisper room\" you can go to and lay in the most comfortable beds and relax without any noise and drink tea or sleep, etc. It is great to be able to relax after a massage and not have to get up and go back to real life. You pay more for the services there but it includes the spa which has dry and wet saunas, terrace pool, etc. Treat yourself to this place. It is coed too so the guys can go.

Altough its been consitently wonderful, the management has recently raised the bar. The resort has mastered the delicate balance between a world class resort, highlighting all the expected ammenities seasoned travler would expect from a five star resort providing a respite from the grind of frequent travel and the reward of treating my children and wife to the luxury of a destination resort offering service and fun. The Pointe Squaw Peak highlights all the postive attributes of the Valley of the Sun. Nestled on the western slope of Squaw Peak, the afternoon sun showcases the meticulus native landscape with palms and catus, , the faux western town, the waterfall and fountains of cascading water put us in another world. It was as if we were on a moive set of showcasing the absolute best of the west. Outside our room was a semi-private pool and jacuzzi so my kids were able to enjoy the relaxing water in the evening hours. The Hole in the Wall resturant served 1st class food and western service. The staff at the River Ranch provided activities such as a water slide race and hula hoop contests, as well as a movie shown at dusk on a big scren brought in for the event. The tennis courts were in great shape, and the minuture golf was fun as always. The tempurature during our stay was chilly \u2013 (even for us cold hardened Coloradians), so we really appreciated the management kicking up the heat on the pools. There is no better value to treat a family with children of all ages or a couple looking for a get away. Some families plan their vacation with a hotel as a base and make side trips to attractions. For the price of a hotel room, the Pointe Squaw Peak gives you the total package \u2013 large comfortable rooms and plenty for the adults and kids to do on property. Highly recommend this resort hotel. PS \u2013 I recommend the hike up Squaw Peak. It\u2019s a relativly sturdy hike, 1.3 miles up (45 min hike) and only 2 miles from the property. This was our ninth consecutive stay at the Squaw Peak Hilton during the Thanksgiving holiday. I grew up in Tempe and my family has since moved to Gilbert. We celebrate Thanksgiving at my brother\u2019s house \u2013 quite a party with 30+ family members! My wife and kids so enjoy the hybrid of vacation at the resort and family time in the east valley. This trip, I noticed a different attitude on property. The Hole in the Wall menu and staff was better; the River Ranch was better, the property looked sharp. Ricco\u2019s was an improvement over Lantana Grill. The room was clean and the hospitality staff very attentive and courteous.

Lazy river was good and...well...really lazy. Sometimes it took some time to make it all the way around. Boys loved the slide and they had kids games at pool, a water slide race, etc. Poolside drinks were expensive I thought, but where aren't they. Staff was great for what interaction we had. My wife brought her own blowdryer and popped the breaker. Called the front desk since we had no lights and expected to sit there for an hour, but the maintenance guy was there in less than 5 minutes. If you are staying here, try out Jeff and Mike at AZ Hummer Tours. It was the highlight of our trip and they are great guys and a wonderful company. Casitas were recently done and had nice granite tops and a 4 top table, desk, 2 leather couches and flat screen TVs. Lots of pillows and we slept well. Wife got a pedicure treatment special at the spa for $50 and got manicure and margarita special for $15 on 1st night. She liked the spa and commented that the manicure lasted an entire week with no issue (don't know that that comment means, but she was happy). Great place and we will be going back next summer.

It was 115 degrees while we were there so the lazy river and the hotel pools were really warm, but the main pool at the River Ranch was cooled. Like some other reviews said, the water park was seriously lacking when it came to daily upkeep. Cups and towels left all over weren\u2019t picked up until the end of the day, some not even then. Rules weren\u2019t enforced as far as, \u201cNo swimming in the lazy river. Stay in your tube\u201d. If you wanted to float around in your tube, you were constantly being blocked or pushed out of the way by people not in tubes, but just playing around in the river. Nothing was ever said to anyone about it, and it was slightly annoying at first, but seeing how they didn\u2019t enforce that rule, I didn\u2019t feel bad breaking the rule about bringing in your own food and drinks. Food and drinks at the poolside restaurants and bar were way too pricey. The rest of the hotel was fine, clean rooms and nice staff. The refrigerator froze everything and we couldn\u2019t find an adjustment to lower the temp., and didn\u2019t bother to ask anyone how to do it. We never ate at any of the hotel restaurants. There are tons of places to eat close by. If you like sushi, try Moto Sushi about a mile up the road. During the week get there between 3 and 5 for happy hour. The only down side of Moto\u2019s was loud angry music. There is a McDonald\u2019s up the road for a cheap breakfast, and a grocery store to stock up on stuff for your stay. The WIFI is $12 per day, but we were able to find a signal and hook up without having to pay for subscribing. It was a weak signal and was hit and miss, but we used it to find some restaurants that we wanted to try. If you absolutely need to have internet, you may want to pay, but try it first and see what kind of signal you get. All in all, not a bad place to stay in Phoenix especially if you have kids. Maybe Hilton will work on maintaining the water park a little better. While we were there it looked like it was all kids working in there and they didn\u2019t really care enough to work hard.

After unpacking we went to the pools and were amazed at the choices we had. There was a general pool that was huge which branched off to a water slide where life guards were in attendance at the top and bottom. From there there was a kiddie area that I had a hard time keeping my 9 and 11 year out of, Next we found the lazy river which was perfect for my husband and son and of course me. When we were looking for activity they had a sports pool & miniature golf. If we were hungry or thirsty the pool bar had everything you could want ( I totally recommend the homemade salsa.) If we wanted something more relaxing the Lantana Grill offered salads and sandwiches & they also went out of there way to please my picky kids. My favorite pool is the one that was framed by our room where the kids could play & we could watch them from the convenience of our deck. Can it get better? They also offer coyote camp where the kids learned about the desert made crafts & just had fun. They also had a spa where my 10 yr old got an ice cream pedicure.

I have been staying at the Pointe hotels since I was a child. My mother had her wedding reception dinner here nearly 30 years ago. It's not the nicest resort in town, but it's usually a good value and always fun for all. That being said, 7/8/2010 will be the last stay for any of my family at either of the Pointe resorts. First of all, I booked a two bedroom casita in March and prepaid for it so it would be a reduced rate. It ended up being $20 less then the actual rate but oh well! At least I had the security of knowing I had the room. Living in Arizona, summer birthdays are not always easy- it's so hot. It has been our tradition to celebrate my birthday and now my daughters birthday at the Pointe Resorts. The staff has always been accomodating to guests and making us feel special. Yesterday was Cassidys 2nd birthday. We booked the casita specifically so we would have room for both grandmas to stay and a little room for some family and friends to enjoy Cassidys birthday. When we arrived- my pre-booked casita was not available. They told me I had only booked the queen one. I found the confirmation and they realized they were in err. \"Ok, that's indeed what you booked, but We don't have one available right now. They are cleaning the downstairs portion of the casita but you may enter thru the king entrance and we will let you know when it's ready.\" Well, at least I have the room right? So we decide to do this. When we unloaded all of our belongings and entered the open portion of the casita, it was cramped to say the least. But at least it was cool. But there were 6 of us with some other family on the way. I asked the maid to put my cake in the fridge downstairs. I got a glimpse of the downstairs portion and was in shock. Someone had a major party on there the night before- like furniture overturned, bottles everywhere, sticky floors- an absolute disaster. No way would these two poor maids get this cleaned up by 5. I vaguely remember the front desk guy saying the guests who were there had a late checkout. Yea, I see why;) We call the desk and to my surprise, we were moved- to a 2-bedroom casita right across the way! But why not in the first place? Before we'd unloaded our things, etc. But the front desk did say they would help up carry our things across the car port. And that we were closer to the pool! Wow! Super nice bell boy came and helped us out. We were settled by 5:30- but that hour and a half of unsettlement for my daughter was not good. If you have or have had a two year old you know what I mean;) When my husband called the desk this AM- we wanted a late checkout and maybe just an apology,he was given the run around by a very rude manager. They didn't do late checkouts(HMMMM) Did we want to stay another night in a suite room for $69? LOL at that(they had a coupon for next stay in a suite room for $79.) The guys acting like we want the whole thing comped which at the time I didn't .I did. I got on the phone and told him the same story I've just told and he laughed at me several times and mocked me when I said I am a service manager at a large corporation and I usually don't complain. He mocked me about having children. His tone of voice was sarcastic. He was absolutely awful. He said that the GM was too busy to help us and wouldn't be available to talk. They also charged us for phone calls when we had paid for the value pack. Including the long distance one when I asked him for the corporate #. And do they not have a 1-800#? I didn't expect much, but I don't expect to be laughed at. I don't expect for everyone to go above and beyond the way I would in a case like this, but rudeness is unacceptable I see in reviews on here and Yelp that they have service/maintenence issues.

Through it all, the staff was friendly and accommodating. More towels were brought up within minutes of us calling for them. We booked the hotel for $127/night, which included a full breakfast buffet at Lantana Grill - which was a nice little bonus. Now on to the River Ranch - this waterpark area made my 11 year old son declare \"This is my favorite hotel ever!!\" We were there during the week - so not too crowded or too crazy. The pool was clean, and they loved the waterslide and poolside games for the kids. For $2.25 total (not per person) our family played unlimited mini golf - it also included use of the tennis courts & fitness center, but we didn't use those. That was a great deal. The mini golf course wasn't super fancy, but clean and well kept. One more thing that was great - on our way out, we stopped to take a picture of us by the fountain behind the lobby in South Pointe. I accidently left my purse on a lounge chair. I realized it 5 minutes after we drove away. In a panic, I called the front desk, and one of the employees ran right out for me and found it still sitting there. He brought it to the front desk & we drove back quickly to get it. Little things like that really made me happy about the resort. My only suggestions would be - the rooms are a little dark. They're not outdated, but just a little dark. The smaller pool within the South Pointe area was filled with left over towels from the night before the next morning. Nothing had been cleaned up. My kids would have loved it if the River Ranch was open later than 8pm. We also noticed large groups of older teens wandering around without adults present. We didn't have any kind of problems at all or feel threatened, but were reluctant to send our kids out anywhere by themselves - even just to get ice. Overall, we loved the hotel and found the little things that we would change not bothersome enough to complain about them. I have stayed at the Phoenician with my husband's work (won't pay for it myself :), and the Pointe HIlton is not that type of place. If you're expecting superb luxury, this is not the place.

We barely got our small car between the cars. The place was a zoo. We saw peole drive in, use the pools and than get in their cars and leave. They had no control over the place at all. It had to be the most horrible experience with a so called luxury resort we had ever had. I had planned on spending some time at their spa but decided against it. IF it was anything like the rest of the place there was no way I was spending my money there. The only plus was that the rooms were clean.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "Machaveli1", "ReviewID": "UR69577941", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here while she was at a conference downtown.

It is well located for the airport but in a quiet part of the city. Our room was a standard - but in the US this means greater value than UK hotels. We had a \"living room\" with television, fridge and coffee maker, bathroom area with toilet and shower separate to the sink area, bedroom with television and a balcony which overlooked a car parking area but we were not at all bothered by noise. The bed was a king size and was extremely comfortable with excellent pillows. The air conditioning was extremely efficient and despite this being June with outside temperates of around 110 degrees F the room was always comfortable. Our stay was during the US school holidays and the hotel was quite busy, particularly over the weekend but we did not find this a problem. Being visitors from the UK and particularly on our first few days before our \"time clock\" had adjusted, we were getting up quite early so sometimes had the pool in our block to ourselves. The lazy river and pool complex located at the back of the hotel were at times busy but on our last evening we had the lazy river to ourselves as families had presumably gone off to have dinner and it was very peaceful and relaxing. However, it has to be said that at times the pool areas were very busy and noisy so you need to choose your time to go and early mornings or late evenings were the times, if you wished to have a peaceful dip. As part of our deal we had breakfast vouchers and used these in the hotel restaurant (Lantina Grille) for the buffet breakfast which was adequate. There is a supermarket a couple of blocks down from the hotel and we bought water and soft drinks there which we kept in the fridge of our room so we always had a cool drink and I had taken tea bags so we used the coffee maker to heat the water and brewed tea this way. How English of us - but it was great to have a cup of tea in the mornings. The hotel was in a good spot for getting to restaurants and shopping areas and it only took around 20 - 25 mins (depending on traffic) to get to Scottsdale shopping and restaurants.

(Previously in Fairmont so used to a good one) The hotel only cost us around \u00a360 per night with a Trailfinders reservation and we were delighted with it - we even had breakfast vouchers. The apartment is good with a living room, fridge, coffee maker, but no safe and on old box TV which will be replaced soon they said. The bedroom is a good size but bathroom is tight. Plenty of onsite close parking. There are pools for each block as well as the water park which is great. Only annoying thing is the tendency to close off part of the best area at weekends for private parties and at weekends the numerous kids who run riot as their parents allow it. The grounds are great and all is nice and clean so no complaints. As experienced Hilton users, we tend to ignore their restaurants but I have the best tip ever here. Across the road is a pub restaurant called Gallachers where you can feel right at home. The extensive menu is great, food quality is brilliant, and the costs are reasonable. The service here is great with all the girls doing a great friendly job and in particular I compliment the manager Ben Lira who wants to know you and treats all his customers really well. This is often the Scottsdale way where people have a great sense of customer relations. You would hardly know Gallachers is there because it looks like an office but is is the best kept secret which needs a flashing sign. Another good one is the Olive Garden on Cactus Road Anyway, back to the Hilton where we decided to stay on for an extra couple of days at a room rate of $109. The hotel is very worthy of a visit particularly for families and for couples, weekdays are best. If you need to use the internet, they charge in the room but just go to the business centre where you can use the computers for free.

All in all, a very nice property with good value for the money. Obviously, being June in Phoenix with the average temperature over 100 degrees, not high season, although it seemed like there were a fair amount of people staying there. The rooms were nice, we had a basic suite with a living area and separate bedroom. The bedroom was a bit small but room enough with the LR area for us to spread out. Clean and pretty quiet. We paid $149/night which included $50/day in resort dining certificates. I looked at other options in Phx/Scottsdale for the same time and the Hilton was the best price for what we wanted to do. From an activity standpoint, the water park is pretty comprehensive. There are 2 decent size pools, each with a volleyball net. One pool has a waterfall which was kind of cool. The other was designated the \"Sports Pool\" and also had a basketball hoop. The lazy river was just fine as it was a perfect current for just lazing in a tube and floating along, I don't think it was designed with high speed rafting in mind. It did get somewhat crowded and there were always kids going by but that's who the resort caters to. The water slide left a lot to be desired, not very long and certainly not very steep (the first half of your ride you were just trying to get going). The putt-putt course was pretty boring if you compare it to miniature golf only properties but fun nonetheless and we weren't charged extra. Food was good. Lantana Grill was the only full service restaurant open while we were there (Hole in the Wall was closed for renovation which we didn't discover until we walked up to the door - no mention on the website which would have been nice). We ate all 3 meals there during our stay and all were excellent. We ordered lunch one day by the pool and it was OK - prices seemed high for what we got, especially the drinks but we did have our coupons. We played golf twice at the Tapatio Cliffs property (sister Hilton resort 10 minutes away) and it was a nice course, not too crowded and inexpensive (June in Phoenix). I saw on other reviews that the internet charge was out of line. I didn't have a laptop but agree that free internet seems to be the norm today. I did look into the business center when I wanted to go online to find out about a local attraction and they wanted something like $3/minute for internet access which was ridiculous. You can print boarding passes for free there though. Other than that, I think the resort is a great family getaway at a reasonable price.

The hotel is over 30 years old, but other than a few things it was hard to notice...I am not sure where the $20 million in upgrades were spent, as this is the first time I had stayed there. We decided to not rent a car on this trip, so took a cab from the airport and it was a short 15 minute drive directly north that cost about $34 there and flat fee $30 back. The staff at the Hilton were very accomodating from the moment we arrived, handling all our bags and taking us by electric car to our casita. Our room was two levels and had a kitchen area right in the entrance area, a large dining room and family room. Upstairs were a pair of queen beds and a fairly large tiled patio. On the hottest days, the patio surface was so hot that you must wear shoes or burn your feet. We loved the curtains in the upstairs area as they let us sleep in as late as we wanted, it made our room very dark. The casita that we were in had a terribly uncomfortable pullout queen bed downstairs, but two lush queen beds upstairs. Every time our next door neighbour took a shower the noise downstairs from the piping was loud, and there was not great sound proofing between rooms. The kitchen was not as expected. It contained a coffee maker, microwave and fridge/freezer. There was nothing as far as cutlery, plates, or dishes of any kind...making it very difficult to prepare anything. The fridge was old, the freezer area had a broken plastic door and barely kept the ice cream we purchased frozen. There was no toaster and we had to ask for a bottle opener. My wife decided to go out and purchase some food for lunches/breakfast and the bell hop (Reuben) was fantastic, driving her there in the hotel van (about 5 minutes away was a Fresh and Easy) and picking her up again in 20-30 minutes when she was finished...he drove her back to our casita and even helped her unpack the food. I had to go out to the local Basha's and purchase some mustard and dish washing detergent. It was about a 10 minute walk to both Basha's and Walgreen's. Also a short walk away was a great Italian restaurant (we had dinner there, great service and food), a Chinese restaurant, Gallagher's (a sports bar), Aunt Chilada's (mexican) and a pizza place. The main purpose for our stay was to entertain two boys, 7 and 4, that is why we selected this property. The hotel had lots of smaller pools in quiet areas, and an amazing water complex. This water complex kept our boys busy from early in the day until 5pm every day. They played basketball, mini golf, floated around the lazy river and played in lots of pools. There were lots of other children there of all ages and on the weekend there was quite a contingent of teenagers as well. We met a couple from Phoenix who had come there for a relaxing/romantic weekend to celebrate an anniversary, but that is not the way I would spend my anniversary. I think this hotel caters to kids and teenagers perfectly, but after 8pm when the pool area shuts down, the hotel becomes a bit of a ghost town. The hotel has started to charge for mini gold by instituting a $2.25 daily per room fee for using the mini golf, fitness center and a few other things. The lazy river is very lazy and it was hot, so it was a good way to stay cool. The hotel was totally packed on Saturday and Sunday and fairly quiet the other days, but at no time did we have any lineups. We also found chairs and loungers at all times of the day in contrast to some other reviews saying that people lined up at 8am and that there were never any chairs to sit on. The waterslide was good, but our 4 yr old missed being able to ride on it by about one inch in height. We did not bring a laptop, but the hotel did charge for high-speed internet (what a ripoff) and the business centre was well equipped but charged a steep fee for use. We dined at the Hole in the Wall restaurant for our first lunch and it was good but not outstanding. We dined at Lantana Grill for dinner twice and breakfast once. The breakfast was excellent, and the dinners were good....both dinners the place was almost deserted, one night because they had a free hoe-down (food included with your hotel stay). We also had dinner at Aunt Chiladas one night, it was busy and food was plentiful and affordable. We had a blown fuse incident one night, but the maintenance staff showed up very quickly and had it fixed just as fast. Every time we came across the staff they were always smiling and saying hello. We ordered a slush drink for the boys at Slim Pickins (poolside cafe), and were a little shocked to pay $6.50 ($7.50 after tip). Overall we loved the place and would go back again. It is great for families, and we saw many families there with parents and grandparents and groups of families too. Teens would love it there too, many of them in the lazy river, and sunning and chatting with friends and checking out the bikinis/bathing suits.

We wanted 2 full beds instead of a king bed, after one call the room was changed in 5 minutes and the staff moved all our bags and our refrig. was replaced after it broke within minutes of a phone call. The suite with 2 beds was plenty roomy for us, we had a sitting area for watching tv and eating snacks and also a balcony with table/chairs. However, if you want to do anything off of the resort you will need to drive, as there is nothing within walking distance. Scottsdale is a twenty miunte drive away, and is clean and fun, with pleny of shopping, art galleries, and places to eat, Some of the Phoenix neighborhoods close to the resort are questionable,", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cNice Resort, small room...\u201d", "Author": "rfgolfer", "ReviewID": "UR61918296", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak during spring break with our small children. The resort is beautiful with eye-catching moutain views. The main pool was nice and it had a fun waterslide and a seemingly endless lazy river. There is plenty to do at the resort during the day. If you are looking for anything to do at night, you will have to leave the grounds. The pool closed every night at 8 PM (the hours are probably seasonal). This pretty much turned the resort into a ghost town at 8 PM. The room itself was pretty small. We had a standard suite which consisted of a sitting area with a sofa bed, bathroom, and bedroom. The space between the foot of the bed and the dresser was very small which made it seem like there was no room to even walk through the bedroom. The golf course is located at the sister facility (Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort) which is also in Phoenix. It was only about a 10 minute drive to get to the other resort. The course was nice and challenging. While we played golf, we put our little ones in the day camp offered at Squaw Peak. The staff was wonderful and the kids really enjoyed the camp. We were apprehensive because we have never utilized a camp at a hotel before. If you have similar feelings about doing this, put your mind at ease, the counselors there were great and trustworthy. As for the value, I cannot comment on the price of the room. We used Hilton Honors points for our stay so the room was free. All of the incidental costs that you incur during a stay like this (dining, snacks, etc.) seemed to be in line with a resort like this. Overall, I would say this was a nice place to stay and I would recommend it. Just be aware that the rooms are not spacious and the resort at this time of year, shuts down at around 8 PM.

We'd arrive around 11 with no chairs available until about 4 but it was fine as we were in the water or golfing anyhow. We did go to the small pool by our Casita a couple times where there were chairs and no one else there. Very quiet if the Ranch is too busy for you. The staff was so friendly and helpful, we kept commenting about how nice they all were. We had lunch everyday at the pool and were really happy with the food. Actually better than the last time we were there. They had a movie night at the pool on Friday night that was fun for kids. Also a Family Fiesta night that had crafts, etc by the Coyote Camp. We stayed in a Casita for the first time and really liked it. Very quiet with the condo feel instead of a hotel room. It was very clean, we have no complaints. Dinner one night at the Hole in the wall restaurant by the pool. Just ok. Walked down to Aunt Chiladas which is consistently decent. We did get a ride from the hotel van which is really convenient just for a tip to the grocery store near by ( food is cheap in Phoenix, and grocery stores sell hard liquor that was also less), we had dinner one night at the Phoenix Grille which was delicious with great service, also pizza that was awesome at Spinatos.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany NY", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed Returning Guests...This Place Used to Be Much Better!\u201d", "Author": "GoingtoPhoenix", "ReviewID": "UR61346925", "Content": "I certainly agree with many of the reviews below about the disapointment to our stay. We were here for 6 nights during Easter Week as well, and it was a mad house!! We have been coming for Spring Break to Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for about 6 years, and it used to be terrific. That's why we keep coming back. Not this time! In order to get a lounge chair at the pool, you had to go down and get in line 45 minutes before it opened at 8 am. Then if you wanted to get morning coffee in the coffee shop, you got into another 30 minute line. Just forget about trying to get into the restaurants. Parking was next to impossible sometimes. The entire resort seemed to be understaffed, over-occupied and just in a state of complete chaos. (Although the front desk was always manned pretty well and friendly.) They advertise that they are \"newly remodeled\". Well, take it from folks that have been coming here for years...the rooms were not as spacious or clean as they used to be. They weren't horrible...they just used to be a lot better. They certainly are not up to par with what one expects from a Hilton resort. They remind me more of the quality you get at a Red Roof Inn. The bed we had was uneven, so we felt as though we were going to roll off to the right all night. That took some getting used to. The room next to us had a family of 8 people + a dog packed into it. The dog barked so much we ahd to call the front desk and have security sent. Overall, this was not the relaxing vacation we expected. It is now only an \"OK\" resort, and a bit like Disney where everything requires you to get in a line. We love visiting the Phoenix area in the Spring from our cold Upstate NY home, but our family discussed it, and we don't think we will be returning to the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak next year.

The hotel is located about 20 mins from phx Sky Harbour airport. Check in was very smooth and quick, staff very friendly. We stayed in a queen bed suite 2306 which was very clean and very comfortable. The living room area had a double pull out sofa bed which was very comfortable, then you walked through to the bathroom and a seperate wash basin area. The Queen bed was fab. The belcony overlooked a courtyard which held a wedding during our stay. the room had an empty fridge, a coffee machine (tea/coffee topped up daily) also 2 tvs which was handy The front of the room overlooked 1 of the smaller pools but it was 3/4ft-6ft and a little deep for my son. The Lazy river..... it was about a 5/10 min walk and if you did not queue up to get in from around 0730 then the chances of getting a sun lounger were very slim!! i was amazed to see a long queue at 0740 one morning. I had no problems taking in drinks and snacks, my son has lots of allergies so always take my own things. Food on the site was expensive and the portions were not huge. $3 for a small box cereal, $3 for 4 thin slices of bacon, \u00a36 for an ice cream $4 for pancakes and they were the cheap items. soft drinks were \u00a33 each. crazy golf was free and was fun. The lazy river was nice to go around but when it was busy it was busy!!! We hired a car from ALamo which was a lifesaver. we went shopping, to get food etc and did 345 miles in 8 days. there is a walgreens and bashers about a 5 min DRIVE from the hotel which sells everything from food to drinks/pharmacy/swimming stuff etc. there is also a subway /nail bar /mcdonalds. went to fashion square to the mall there but it was expensive so i found a good outlet mall called ARIZONA MILLS its about 25 min drive. The concierge team in the hotel are great and full of knowledge, wherever you want to go they wiull know about it and have directions for you, trust me the team are the best i have met. Also visited a cowboy themed restaurant rustlers rooste, sawdust on the floors cowboy band playing, huge ribs rattle snake is a must steaks etc... was about $78 for 2 adults 1 child. the beef ribs were eat as much as you want. walmart is open 24hours one on both ends of bethany home road, this was handy to stock up on breakfast bits and cold drinks, for the fridge in the room. The fridge did seem to freeze things it was a little tempremental at times. i would recommend taking plastic bowls for cereal. our stay was from the 04th-13th April and it was busy! i dont think i would stay during this period again. All of the hotel staff were very courtious and happy to help The hole in the wall needs to lower its prices. A car is a must really unless you like walking in the extreme heat. The shops are located on lots of little retail parks so you need to drive from 1 to the other. There is a cheescake factory about 20 mins away $6.95 for a slice. cigarettes were $5.99 for malboro light but dont forget to add tax. everything has tax added to it at the end of your bill, so dont forget that. Banks will not exchange currency unless you bank with them, we went to an amex travel center on 22nd street but the rate was $1.41 per \u00a31 plus a $6 service charge. The hotel to my suprise offered us $1.52 per \u00a31, the hotel gets its rate from XE which is a good convertor to use.

I'll start with what was great... The room set up is IDEAL for a family of four with kids that are able to share the pull-out sofa (which by the way was the most comfortable pull-out bed I've EVER laid on!). We bought breakfast basics and utilized the mini-fridge. I recommend bringing a few plastic bowls, a cutting board and small knife from home and you're all set. The River Ranch water park is so fun for the kids. The activities they have scheduled for the kids happen every few hours and our kids loved it. The mini-golf course was super fun as well. The overall set-up and location of this hotel is pretty ideal if you ask me. You're close to so many things and we even did a great hike right from the resort. Here's what brought some disappointment... the front desk staff was less than stellar every time we dealt with them. After trying to get into our room for five minutes (no keys worked) I went down to the front desk to ask for help, which wasn't close by, and was informed that we were told the wrong room number. Oops. No apology. No \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything. I wasn't looking for any sort of freebie but just a general recognition for the inconvenience this caused... not to mention the people we totally freaked out by trying over and over again to get into their room! The River Ranch, as fun as it is, was so crowded it was hard to relax. Come prepared to play \"the game\" if you come for spring break.... i.e. get up EARLY to get chairs. The RR opened at 8:00 a.m. and I went over at 7:30 a.m. (after hearing that you had to get their early to get chairs). I was the 50th person in line. Seriously. It was ridiculous but the alternative was to not have chairs there. There are signs that say you \"must have someone stay with your reserved chairs at all times\" but that was absolutely NOT the case. It also said \"no outside food or drink allowed\" and yet everyone had snacks. This totally wasn't a problem for me but it became a problem when my 11 year old daughter, who went back to the room to get a box of crackers to bring back to snack on, was turned away at the entrance. Someone told her she couldn't bring in outside food and she had to walk all the way back to the room to return the crackers. This made us pretty upset considering everywhere you look there are people eating \"outside\" snacks, making PB & J's, drinking coffees from Starbucks, etc. Really? You're going to pick on a little kid who doesn't know to \"hide\" her outside food when she walks in? Ridiculous. The food we did purchase that same day for lunch from the poolside menu was borderline unedible. We are not usually picky people. We're generally just so happy to be on vacation that not much bothers us but there was enough issues on this trip that I doubt we'll return to this location. We possibly could have had a random experience but service is everything these days. It doesn't go unnoticed by our family.

We weren't given the proper # of meal ticket (gets with his upgraded status) and the list goes on... We only found one nice person at the front desk late one evening. The hotel makes the extra perks that diamond status gives very difficult. If you want your free bottles of water hike out to the gift shop near river ranch. Your free breakfast vouchers can be redeemed only at the gift shop in the main lobby which had a slim selection of crummy pastries. But for an extra $7 you can again hike to the Lantana grill wait in line for the overpriced buffet then miss out on getting a sun lounger unless you are up super early which isn't fun on vacation.

We were there for a spring break week, and were pleasantly surprised that even in a resort filled with kids, it was a very relaxing trip for the adults too. Everyone who works there was very friendly and accommodating, and there are lots of different activities to choose from to keep kids busy. When we arrived on a Friday night, we had a delicious dinner at the Lantana Grille and then walked over to the River Ranch where a kids' movie was being shown. We enjoyed playing the 18-hole miniature golf course that lined the banks of the lazy river, and the kids' activities at the pool every hour during the afternoons were well done. There are so many lounge chairs around the various pools that there was never a problem finding a couple of chairs together no matter what time you ventured to the pool area. The pools at the North Pointe and South Pointe buildings were a quiet respite when wanting a change from the River Ranch's active environment. One thing I really liked was that the resort fee was optional and really very small (less than $3 a day) and you could add it on any day during your stay if you decided to take advantage of things like golf, tennis, or the fitness center (which was very well equipped). The breakfast buffet at the Hole in the Wall was delicious and a good deal, as was the weekend barbecue buffet at the pool. Menu items at the Slim Pickens poolside bar were very good, with generous portions, and the poolside waiters were friendly and prompt. The bar and grille across the street (Gallagher's) was nice for a relaxed dinner, and had so may flatscreen TVs it would be impossible to miss any of your favorite sports. The mexican restaurant just off the property (Aunt Chilada's) had excellent food - loved the unusual chips and salsa. We only ate at the Lantana breakfast buffet once, and although it was good, the line was too long to wait for the one cook who was doing all the made-to-order food. The concierge staff was quite helpful; we enjoyed a great horseback ride at Cave Creek thanks to their suggestion. Even the bellman gave us tips on things to do while there at the hotel. The property is clearly older, but well maintained. It has the feel of an apartment or condo complex more than a hotel. We stayed in a standard suite with a king bed and a queen sleeper sofa. There was plenty of room for clothes in the large dresser and big closet (with plenty of hangers, which is a nice change from the usual hotel stay.)

The couches in the living room are incredibly uncomfortable and for our taste, the bed was too soft. The bathroom could also use a little TLC as the paint was peeling and there were the beginnings of mildew. Probably the biggest disappointment was the kitchenette. There was a decent size fridge, but it barely kept anything cold, much less frozen. There is also only a microwave, no toaster etc. One last suggestion for management, if you want people to re-use their towels, you need to provide hooks where they can be hung to dry.

Few more words about David--Awesome, friendly, tuned in to the customer seeking a great stay. Hilton folks: this guy is a jewel ! This room was a king suite. It was the best. Centrally located with easy access to everything at the resort. The layout was excellent. Impeccably clean, (Maria does a great job). There was a spacious living area which included a comfy sofa, oversized side chair, office desk/chair area, TV and wet bar area. The wet bar area had a mini fridge and granite counter tops which held the coffee maker etc. There is a central area between the living space and bedroom which houses the bath and sink/dressing area. This room is separated by double doors--nice touch. The king bedroom is off the bath area separated by a pocket door--love that feature and here's why: I could have privacy later in the evening with full access to the bed and bath area while my husband visited with a family member/guest out in the living area. Hilton thought of everything!! The king bead was comfy, lined with pillows. The room had it's own TV as well. Off the King room was a lovely private balcony. My husband & I brewed hot tea and sat on the balcony every morning with the USA Today paper that was delivered to our doorstep.--Great way to start a day--relaxing. There were waterfalls outside our balcony both in the front and in the back. In the evenings we would leave our bedroom patio door open using only the screen and the sound of the falls really adds to the relaxed mood even more--sweet touch. Highly recommend this room :) Brad Wills in Shipping Dept is one other person to mention. Brad is fantastic. He will help you with any shipping needs during your stay. He is very friendly and goes out of his way to ensure excellent quality service. He has soome great stories too :) The resort: the lazy river is the best thing this resort has going for it. Absolutely LOVED it. The river winds around the water park area and a leisurely pace. Water temp is just perfect. You can stay on it as long as you like. The blue tubes are the most comfy. One thing is for sure--you will NEVER have a problem finding a lounger chair. Tons of them everywhere and nicely placed--not too crowded. The quality of the outdoor furnishings exceeded my expectations. Beautiful designs/textures. They provided extra thick lounge cushions making it very easy to fall asleep while sunning--again, relaxing. Pool towels were provided in abundance--as many as you needed or liked. I like extra so that was sweet. They have servers from the bar/restaurant area should you desire refreshments delivered right to your chair--Hi Jessie!--she was great. This resort has very nice landscaping, lots of greenery, sort of surprising and again exceeded my expectations. Restaurant called \"Hole in the Wall\" has a daily happy hour 4-6. Order the veggie sandwich and sweet potato fries--awesome. They also have Blue Moon beer on tap served with the signature orange slice and it goes great with the sandwich. The Hole in the Wall has a fabulous outdoor patio with a fireside pit area--very nice. We tried the other restaurant and ordered salads--just okay. Walk outside the front of the resort turn left and follow the chili peppers painted on the side walk about 1-2 blocks. This leads you to the GREATEST Mexican food restaurant called \"Aunt Chiladas\". This is an old historical structure and has a fantastic outdoor patio seating area. The food is great and reasonably priced. Please go--trust me, you will not regret it. I wish we had found it sooner because we would have been frequent visitors :) We have stayed at many 4-5 star resorts and this one ranks right there with them. We will definitely return again.

You can experience that true resort feeling under the warm skies and palm trees of Arizona at the base of these beautiful desert mountains of Squaw Peak. While the rest of the country was experiencing cold temps and snow...we were basking in 75 degree temps under bright sunny skies during mid February. It was awesome! It should be noted...you can't beat the central location to downtown either...particularly if you love sports like we do and want to catch an Arizona Diamondbacks or Phoenix Suns game. We had a wonderful time once again...and look forward already to our next visit. You will not regret your visit to Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak.

He gave me instructions of who to call when I arrived since the hotel was going to take care of my taxi ride from the airport to the hotel. This was all coordinated beautifully and I did not have to explain anything. Then I was given vouchers for 2 free breakfasts to compensate for the inconvenience of the change in hotels. There was also shuttle service between the two hotels since I needed to be at meetings at the hotel that I originally booked so the inconvenience was minimal. The most extraordinary thing was when I got my bill and my 2 nights were paid for by the Squaw Peak Resort.

Hotel overbooked; we were upgraded from reserved 2-bdrm casita to the Palacio, a \"secret\" 3-bdrm/2-bath guest house on the resort (but way up a mountain) that's owned by developer. True house--big place, 2-car garage, gorgeous sweeping views of city/mountains on one side, but the house is cut into mountain so no view on one other side plus the rain just poured in there. Kitchen flooded. Ditto super-cheesy sunken firepit area in family room. Still, lots of space, private hot tub, fab views. Decor is early '90s bare-bones corporate hotel (think Oakwood apts). Shower head is 4 feet ground, so anybody over 5'2 has a not so fun time in the shower. As an upgrade, the place was amazing, but to rent? At $2k-$3k per night? Ridiculous. No way. However, entire resort staff could not have been more gracious or accommodating, even when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the house and trudged (through pouring rain and 70-mph-winds) to the restaurant (about 1/4 mile away) to be saved. Narrow road up mountain to house; staff takes you there in a golf cart or van. Awoke in a.m. to find bedraggled, water-soaked coyote trying to make his way up the mountain from our patio. Somehow grand, yet pathetic/sad at the same time. Kind of the perfect metaphor for the whole stay. Dinner at Hole in the Wall; decent appetizers (potato skins; deep-fried Southwest \"spring rolls\") but entrees (filet mignon; ribeye; chicken-fried elk) were pretty bad, as in \"probably frozen/microwaved.\" Margarita seemed watered-down, but kicked my butt. Brunch at Lantana--your basic \"business hotel\" buffet, ugh.

The River Ranch staff is overly accommodating with the games they host throughout the day. My kids always seem to win a smoothie or a cheeseburger. They even set up a movie projector on Friday nights - last time showing Pocahontas. 2- The semi private pools: After the day of swimming, my wife and I relax in the over-sized room while the kids swim in the semi-private pool that is shared by only a few guest rooms. 3 - The staff and clean rooms: The housekeeping and maintenance staff are invisible, but the room and property is always clean. I have to wonder if Disney doesn't secretly send their staff to the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for training. 4- The restaurant. We are always impressed with the quantify and quality of food served at Hole in the Wall restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff there. 5 - The gym and spa First rate with ample exercise equipment. Being adjacent to the nicest neighborhoods in Phoenix, I can tell the regular members are fit, in mind, body and financially. My wife enjoys the spa each time we come, and says this is her favorite place to get a massage. 6- Proximity to hiking and climbing. We clime Squaw Peak each time we stay at the property. A relatively short hike from the room, about 2 1/2 hours round trip. Amazing we can be so close to the mountains ans so convenient to all the good shopping Phoenix has to offer. 7 - and most important, the HERO factor.

First, the location is the best. We like to be outdoors and active. The hotel is situated on a bike/running path which connects to Dreamy Draw Recreation Park. Dreamy Draw Park has many miles of running/walking, biking paths which are both paved, or natural mountain trails. We preferred the paved trails, but many prefer the natural so you never fee like the trails are crowded. Next, the hotel is located just a mile or so from Squaw Peak. If you like to hike, this is perfect. You are there in minutes by car. Squaw peak is a good work out - I think the summit is about 1.2 miles. The path up is a good work out (we climbed 3 times) and you are always in the sun so even if it's cool out (50 degrees for us) you're plenty warm. The climb is moderate to difficult, but most people can handle it if you are careful. Definitly do it - the scenery of the entire valley is gorgeous! We also climbed Camelback Mountain during our stay which is about 3 miles from Squaw Peak. Camelback Mountain is much more difficult and challenging to climb. We saw people of all ages and conditions climbing both, but if you are not in good shape Camelback Mountain may not be much fun, and instead it will be a stressor for you. More about the hotel - we do not have small kids, so the lazy river water area was not a draw for us. However, we met many people with young kids and talked to them. Everyone said they had a great time. The water was kept warm, so even with 50 and 60 degree weather the kids and parents used it and had fun. The hotel pools were warm water too, and the hot tubs were really warm. You could see steam rising from the water during the cool mornings and evenings. Also, there are so many different pools and hot tubs that we neveer felt it was crowded, or we didn't want to use them because of too many people. The hotel rooms are big, with good TVs and room sizes. The staff does a great job of keeping the rooms and grounds spotless. As a matter of fact - the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. My wife and I travel quite a bit, and you usually run into a person or two who does not understand custumer service at hotels. Squaw Peak Hilton - every staff member was friendly, helpful, smiles and a hello, ready to help anyway they can. My wife and I also like to exercise. The hotel Spa and Fitness center was the best. This fitness center also has local members who use it. It is the best, most up to date, state of the art facility I have ever used at a hotel. If you pay the extra $2.50 a day charge, you can use the fitness center, and tennis courts for no additional charge. This is a bargain, make sure you do it. It has free weights, machine weights, many top notch treadmills with built in TVs, stationary bikes and stair masters, exercise classes, steam room, full showers and lockers. The fitness center is a short walk (1 minute) from the hotel lobby - truly outstanding facility. It is big enough that again, even though many people were using it, we felt like we had it to ourselves. Never had to wait for a machine etc..

It turns out that I did. The purpose of the trip was a romantic getaway for me and my husband before we have our second child that I'm expecting in less than 3 months. Many folks who reviewed said that this was not a good romantic choice. I think that depends on when you choose to go. I chose to stay on a Sunday night in September because I figured that all of the kids would be in school and so there would be very few families left in the hotel. I found this to be true. However, I can imagine that this place is a zoo during the summer, but any place with a water park is going to be like that during the hot summer months in AZ. I chose this hotel because of all of the amenities and the ability to stay in a Casita. The thought of being in our own \"little house\" really appealed to me. Although I had been warned by others that the Casitas were actually a couple of apartment-like structures put together, it still felt like we were in our own little world. It wasn't like being in a regular hotel room where you can hear every toilet flush and coming and going of your next door neighbors. The covered parking right behind each Casita makes your car drivable after being in the sun. There was also a small private pool right next to our one-bedroom King (bed) Casita. The inside was very nicely decorated. The large refrigerator, microwave and sink/bar area were perfect for quick snacks and it was fun to have the bedroom area on a separate floor from the kitchen table, desk area and couch/TV area downstairs. Upstairs was nice as well with a place to lounge as well as a bed and another bathroom. Other reviewers were correct about the door to the toilet area being nearly impossible to close due to its proximity to the toilet itself, but with a 2 yr old at home I'm used to not having privacy in the bathroom! I had hoped to spend time walking the grounds, but we got too busy. Fortunately we had a great view from our small balcony and from the first floor of our Casita. I didn't visit the Spa at the Squaw Peak resort as I had planned, but instead the spa at the sister property at Tapatio Cliffs (they had a Spa Week discount on a particular treatment). I had an aromatherapy/maternity massage. I haven't had many spa treatments so I don't have much to compare it to, but the staff seemed very professional and it was an overall positive experience. There is a free shuttle between the two properties but it only leaves on the hour from one hotel and half hour from another so it may not work if you don't want to wait or arrive early. So overall I was very happy with my stay. Next time I'll book at least 2 nights so I can experience the water park, mini golf, and restaurant. Other positive notes: friendly staff, discounted rate by booking 21 days in advance (non-refundable), ability to check-in 2 hours early simply by calling, close proximity to a mall (Desert Ridge Marketplace - 15 min) and my husband was thrilled at the number and variety of channels on TV.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cNice, quiet hotel - best for relaxing.

Staff we great on arrival - given choice of queen or king bed, and bell boy took us to our room on a golf buggy which was good as it was very hot. Our room was nice and roomy, very clean and had everything we could want. Only downside was that the balcony was very small and was on the back of the hotel so was very dark and had trees overhanging it so we weren't able to sit out. Hole in the Wall restaurant was very nice to eat breakfast - amazing choice for $15 dollars and yes there were busy times but nothing too bad. HitW also served lunch and dinner overlooking the main pool which was nice. The one thing that spoilt the first couple of days for us was the children at the resort..... we did go over Labor Day so did expect it to be busy, but the amount of unsupervised children was ridiculous. We stayed away from the main pool with the lazy river and stayed in the North Pointe pool, but that was just as bad with the kids (and the parents in some cases!!). Once the weekend was over and a lot of the families left the hotel was lovely and peaceful and the North Pointe pool was lovely and relaxing. Small pool with jacuzzi (not working whilst we were there but nice to use as hot tub) and swim up bar. For those wanting bigger pool there was the main one with the slide and lazy river but the small quiet one suited us. As we didn't have a car, there wasn't much we could do as the hotel is quite isolated but the hotel were great at helping us sort out an evening in downtown Pheonix to see the D-Backs baseball team (excellent evening, highly recommend this, even to non sports lovers. Great experience, amazing venue). Hotel helped with transport etc. Would recommend anyone staying at this hotel to use the shuttle bus to go to the Fashion Mall at Scottsdale - only $15 dollars for a round trip - well worth it.

Be aware that kingsize bed suites are smaller than regular 2 queensize beds. Cleanliness of rooms is OK, but you could expect better from Hilton. Value is very good if you can get summer deal prices.

We also liked the \"newly renovated\" description as well as the many photos shown. When we got there, we found that what we got did not look like the photos. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is ok and nice, and if you didn't have anything to compare it to, it would be fine, but it doesn't seem to be what you normally find with Hilton Hotels. The buildings seem to be spread out and confusing. We arrived very late, and though we had a map AND directions, had a difficult time finding our room. Directions that are second nature for hotel staff take awhile for guests to figure out. A trip to the main lobby for coffee was a \"field trip\" from our room. One time, while coming from a different direction, I really got lost and it took some time to figure out where I was because buildings tend to look the same. The suites/rooms were described as \"spacious,\" but as a family of four, we found ourselves tripping over each other because the room was much smaller than presented in the photos, and the one bed extended into the doorway between the living and sleeping area. The bathroom was also very small. When we called the front desk upon arrival, they were very nice, but we were told that all the room and bathroom sizes were this size. In addition, the room we had did not look at all newly renovated, and in fact it looked worn and not quite as spotless as I would like. (i.e. dust on door crevices, some spots on rug, floor, etc.) The front desk confirmed that all the rooms were newly renovated. There was a convention going on while we were there. Our room was near an elevator, (doors go to the outside not hallways) and needless to say the conventioneers were noisey. My husband had to ask them to quiet down several times, because there seemed to be no soundproofing, & noise carried right into the room. Again, they weren't doing anything wrong, just talking, but the nights were late ---and the noise definitely carried. The description of the slides at the water park says \"slides.\" There was only one slide, (if there were two we never found the second one) and they were probably not as fun of a slide as anticipated. Several times down the slide and we had our fill. The lazy river and pool area was nice, but not as fresh and new looking as the photos. There were always tons of small and what appeared to be unsupervised children in the lazy river. Many weren't following the rules of using inner tubes, and no staff person said anything about this at all. One other note is there seemed to be a lot of staired walkways to go from point A to point B. If someone has difficulty with stairs, they would find it hard to get around the pool/ waterpark area. The staff overall was very nice. A very pleasant surprise was \"Slim Pickens\" --the pool restaurant/ food service. The food there was absolutely out of this world outstanding---hands down better than the other restaurants on the premises. I would go back there anytime to eat. It was expensive, like the other restaurants, but well worth it. The spa was also and excellent experience. While in Phoenix, we checked out other hotels that showed up as options when we were booking this hotel, and though their photos looked worse online, the hotels in the same star or price range were much more outstanding. This hotel is ok, but honestly, we probably wouldn't choose it again if we take another vacation in Phoenix or recommend it to a friend. My daughter summed it up when she said, \"Compared to the other hotels we looked at with the same star rating while there,(key word compare) this one really shouldn't have the same number of stars. \" If you don't have anything to compare this to, or previous experience with Hilton Hotels, you would probably say the hotel is ok.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durant, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cOasis in the desert!\u201d", "Author": "Rebekahj0", "ReviewID": "UR38065479", "Content": "We were only here for one night, but if we could have stayed longer we would have!

I chose the cheapest room because I thought we'd be there only to sleep. The room was the best part, as it was fairly quiet and clean. We did a \"couples massage\" and the woman who did mine was a troll. She acted like we were an inconvenience to her and she was rude to my wife. My wife's masseur was pleasant, but stifled by his partner, the troll. We left a tip for my wife's masseur, but I think it was probably unknowingly split between the two. We then went to the water park and tried to enjoy the lazy river, but all the unsupervised kids there, were like the impatient motorists in rush hour traffic, trying to zip past you and there's no room to go. It's actually called the \"Lazy River\" for a reason, right? We tried the slide and found out that flip flops and glasses aweren't allowed, but the ground was so hot, it was impossible not to ascend without something on your feet. We then went into the main swimming area, but we were repulsed by the cloudy and warm water. The rules allowed for beverages to come into the pool, but it seemed as though the crowd had spilled many of their drinks in and around the pool, as it smelled like beer. We then went to the Hole in the Wall restaurant, which should have been called the \"Hole in the Wallet\" restaurant. We ordered long islands, but I think they were just a mix of lemonade and iced tea. We also ordered the rattlesnake, which came out in a small cereal bowl. For $33, we were expecting something more than stale, breaded, fried, clumps. If you've ever had popcorn chicken, it was similar to that, except it tasted more like calamari and you could have fit it all in an 8 oz styrofoam coffee cup. I ordered the half-rack of ribs and my wife ordered the blackened chicken breast. The meat on both of ours was very dry and my wife's chicken was flavorless. The veggies were barely cooked and the fry bread was almost literally, fried bread (not typical of fry bread or funnel cake). The BBQ sauce was something you'd find on the bottom shelf at a supermarket. The total cost of the meal came up to $115 and we left the restaurant very unimpressed. We were going to try the mini golf, but decided against it and didn't want to get any more frustrated with the whole experience. The \"On Demand\" channel went out and we decided to just watch something on regular TV. We were able to check-in early and leave one hour later upon request. However, you had to read up on these little tidbits to take advantage of them, along with $2.25 \"all access\" daily fee. The \"all access\" charge could be applied to your bill upon request, which allows you to avoid the al a cart pricing for the pool, mini golf, gym, and other amenities. We felt that the bellhop was very helpful and wasn't holding out his hand for tips the way the others (massage place & restaurant) did. The general theme seemed to be that the quality was extremely low and service was terrible, but the prices remained at the resort level. My wife enjoyed the pillows, bedding, and the clock-radio. In my opinion, this is a horrible deal for anyone. I've stayed in cheaper places that provided more courteous service and better quality than this place. I would recommend finding a cheaper room, going to a water park, scheduling a massage, and picking a restaurant separately.

The two bedrooms upstairs had a king in one and two queens in the other and a full bathroom for each. Granite counter-tops throughout. Robes for everybody and very nice bath sundries. The only drawback for me were the mattresses. I can't sleep on anything firmer than a hammock it seems so I had some back pain, but my wife and boys loved it. The Grounds, they are actually quite beautiful. Lots of trees overhanging the roads that lead to the casitas (which is unusual in Arizona) it made my wife and I wish we could live on streets like that.

Somewhat Disappointing!\u201d", "Author": "ccollman", "ReviewID": "UR31188626", "Content": "This is the second time I have stayed here at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak. The first time was last year and the experience was not quite up to the hype. Unfortunately, things have not gotten much better, and I will probably never return again. Decided to take my wife the first night to celebrate our anniversary, then have our children join us the second night and go to the River Ranch (the waterpark). I had made arrangements for an early check-in at 1:00pm. Upon our arrival at 1:00pm, only the King bedroom part of the two-bedroom, two-story casita was ready, and I was told that we could check-in to that part, then when the rest of it was ready, the hotel would bring over the new room keys. We waited until 4:00pm with no word and no keys. I then walked back over to the front desk, only to be told by another front desk clerk that she didn't know if the rest of our casita was ready yet or not, and she would have to call and find out. I waited in the lobby nearly fifteen minutes while someone went to the casita and checked. Apparently, it had been done earlier and nobody told us or brought us the new keys. Strike One. While waiting in the lobby, I called room service and ordered dinner to be delivered to the room as a nice suprise for my wife. I ordered one filet, one salmon and a bottle of Pinot Grigio. After returning to the room, I received a call from room service stating that they were out of salmon and would I like to make another choice. Out of Salmon at 4:00pm on a Thursday??? Whatever. So I ordered two filets. Delivery was scheduled for 7:45pm. My wife and I had a 6:00pm appointment for a couples massage at the Tocasierra Spa. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with signs that said that the air conditioning was broken (late-May in Phoenix ... 102 degrees for a high that day) and they apologized for any inconvenience. We asked to see the actual therapy room first, and while it was a bit warm and the fans were very noisy, which drowned out the background music, the massages were very good. 50 minute couples massage ... $200 plus gratuity. The men's locker room was a mess, though, with old wet towels all over the floor and trash overflowing in the waste paper cans. Upon returning to the room, room service called and said they were out of the Pinot Grigio, and would I like some other wine instead. So I ordered a Chardonnay. Then I added a cheesecake and an order of chocolate-covered stawberries. At 7:50pm, room service called and said the food was on its way. It arrived moments later. To be honest, the filets were outstanding! Hot, juicy and tender. The mashed potatos and asparagus spears were good as well. The cheesecake was okay ... a bit dry and crumbly. The chocolate-covered strawberries were really good! All of this came to $175 plus gratuity. What??? Apparently, this hotel has one price for its food, and another price, approximately 25% to 45% higher depending, for the same food if delivered as room service (the filet mignon is $32 each on the regular restaurant menu but was charged to us at $45 each as part of room service). AND, they charge a $3 room service fee AND a 22% Room Service Gratuity. The food was good but ... Strike Two! I went and picked up the kids the next day and we spent the better part of the day at the River Ranch in the water. The pools, slide and lazy river are all a lot of fun. However, I did learn that the River Ranch is open to the general public, and that anyone who pays $15 each can get in. I guess there is a certain part of me that resents the fact that I just paid $179 per night for a casita and access to the River Ranch, yet someone can drive in off the streets and get into the waterpark for $15 and take all of the chairs and umbrellas. That evening, my wife and I went to the gift shop to get a deck of cards and a cup of coffee. You got it ... they don't serve coffee after 7:30pm. Went to check-out this morning. Noticed a charge of $157 from Slim Pickins, the food service at the pool. All we had at the pool was one drink, a daquiri, for $9.50. I questioned the charge, and was told that since the accounting departmenht wasn't in on Saturdays, there wasn't much that could be done. I had to demand that the charge be removed, which it eventually was. Strike Three! The casita itself was lovely. We had a two-bedroom, two-story casita. Downstairs was a living room, half-bathroom, dining room and small kitchenette with a 3/4 size fridge and microwave. There is no stove and no stovetop burners, so all cooking has to be done in the microwave. Upstairs are the two bedrooms, each with its own full bath, and a patio. Having a private parking space was nice. The grounds are well-kept and well-manicured. The River Ranch, however, is a mess. I saw empty beer bottles, plastic drink cups and food trays laying around for hours after people had finished them and left. \"Ranch Crew\", as the staff is called, is quick to get you something in hopes of a tip, but it seems nobody wants to clean-up after the messes. They call this place a resort, but in my book, there has to be a level of service and a certain expectation to be considered a resort, and this place just doesn't meet that expectation in my mind.

Our kids (ages 6 and 9) loved it! We played mini golf and took advantage of the water park and smaller pools. Chairs at the water park filled up very quickly. They do have a policy of no saving chairs, but that policy was largely ignored. We paid $235 per night during spring break (taxes included), which was fair considering the quality of the resort and amenities. Mini golf, tennis, exercise room were all extra, but we discovered that if pay for one activity you were then able to add on other activities or services for a flat $2 fee (i.i. we paid for mini golf, but then were able to use the exercise room for a flat $2 for the remainder of our stay).

There is a very peaceful adult-only pool at the fitness center that I snuck over to once. The room was good, but not great. Funky smell at first, but I always bring candles.

The service was not good either. The Lantana Grille had much better food, but was even higher priced. Cocktails by the pool are $10 for a small cup and usually weak. Only once we got a good bartender. THE UGLY: We had toilet issues from the start...it wouldn't flush correctly. Plunger man had to be called a few times. Then we had a massive overflow that wouldn't stop. Our room was flooded in a few inches of water and it took a long time for anyone to come. When a guy did show up, he was not equipped to handle the job and had to call someone else. Finally, a guy came with a wet vac and a big fan. The carpet was still soaked though (squish, squish wherever we walked) and was never actually cleaned, nor was the bathroom tile. That's just gross! We were able to move to a new room after they finally realized how bad it was. I understand that these things happen, but an apology for our inconvenience would have been nice. Overall, we had a great time. We played putt-putt once and tennis once, but mostly hung out by the pools. The fitness room is nice...I should have spent more time there : ). The spa is okay. I had a massage that was a waste of $100. My daughter had a teen facial that she thoroughly enjoyed, so I guess it depends on who you get. If you like steam rooms, this one has major steam! The resort is not luxurious, but it's nice and a great place for a family vacation. The Old Spaghetti Factory downtown is not far and we had a great dinner there. We also loved Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale~ trendy with unique and delicious food. Not so much for kids, but they were accomodating and made cheese quesadillas for us. We also went to Rawhide Western Town. It's about a 30 min. drive, but lots of fun.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort for young kids\u201d", "Author": "krakor", "ReviewID": "UR27908392", "Content": "Just got back & we loved it. I always like to start with the negatives, of which there weren't many: 1) The main pool is not heated. Certainly not a big deal in the summer in Phoenix, but when we were there it was 55 when we woke up and 80 at midday. It would have been nice if the pool were heated. Note that the lazy river WAS heated and was fantastic during the cooler periods. 2) We blew the circuit breaker in our room 3 times in 7 days, without using any irons or hair dryers. Not sure what was up with that, but it was not a big deal. The first time, they sent someone immediately and they gave our child a \"token\" good for a prize. The next two times, we had seen where it was and just popped it ourselves. OK, now on to the positive - everything else!! 1) Most importantly, the people were great. Very friendly and helpful. 2) The kids had a blast (we went with my daughter & her cousin). They loved the pools, water slide, and miniature golf - all easily accessible & safe. They also loved the ice cream stand & the shaved ices & (virgin of course) pina colada slushes. 3) The kids camp. We always try them for a 1/2 day first. We have found some that are terrible and a few that are great. This fell into the \"great\" category. Not just somewhere to put the kids for a few hours while you do \"adult\" stuff - your kids will be begging to go back to this camp! They have a great \"camp\" facility with books, toys, puppet shows, crafts, lunch, and a short movie after lunch. They spend a lot fo the day outside, swimming (closely supervised), in the small playground, or doing activities like scavenger hunts (broken into small groups, each with a supervisor - who are all friendly & great with kids & range in age from college to say 55). One day, they went to one of the hotel reataurants and learned to make salsa - and brought home a nice sized container of what they made (which was delicious). 4) The restaurants. A tad overpriced and not fancy, but very good food and a great breakfast buffet. There are also a lot of good nearby restaurants (if you like spicy, try Los Dos Molinos - very casual, but great food & very hot). 5) The room. We had a Casita. All the rooms (if you figure out the shortcuts) are very close to the main pool / minigolf area. Most Casitas are also close to a small, more private pool. We tried that one day, but preferred the main pool as we enjoy seeing the activity & being close to food if we want it. (Oh yeah, the poolside grill is pretty good & has fast service). Our room was large and clean and comfortable. 6) The location - you are a few blocks from 51, which basically leads everywhere or connects easily to a road that does. You can be downtown in like 5-10 minutes. We REALLY enjoyed the Phoenix zoo - rated one of the top 5 zoos for kids. We were able to ride camels and pet sting rays and sharks (yes, really). They also have a walkthrough monkey village where there is no barrier between you and the monkeys. There is also a great sprinkler area with a \"water cave\" and small water slide where the kids can relax and cool off - best to bring some shorts to change into (we had some wet kids after that!). We also went on some horseback riding in the desert at a place recommended by the hotel - that was about a 30-minute drive, but worth it. We also went to some American Indian ruins. There is also a spa, but we never used it.", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cBrochure claims are overstated - but nice stay nonetheless\u201d", "Author": "mamajojoYork", "ReviewID": "UR27697324", "Content": "Our family of 4 - 2 adults and children aged 12 and 9 - stayed here for five nights.

The hotel blurb had promised 'spectacular views' and, indeed, the surrounding area is amazing, but the hotel has not exploited its location.

However, although the rooms are dark they are clean and spacious.

I live in Phoenix and have stayed at both the Point Hilton Squaw Peak and Tapatio Cliffs Resorts more than 30 times over the past couple of years. I usually stay for a few days to get away or when friends and family visit I suggest they stay at either property and I get a room as well. I am actually bummed that I have to write this review as I have had many great experiences at this property, however be it cut backs due to the economy or just terrible customer service I will not be back. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. As a Hilton Honors member I had the worst experience I have ever had at a property in my life. I have a friend in town with his wife and 2 kids and another couple both are staying at Tapatio Cliffs and took the shuttle over to Squaw Peak. We tried to make reservations at the 2 hotel restaurants, however both said they were booked and they suggested Aunt Chiladas which is off property about 1/2 mile away. They said they had a shuttle that would take us there and back. We had 7pm reservations and they brought us over in golf carts, which the kids enjoyed, and the driver was very nice and I gave him a good tip. We were informed just to call the hotel or the restaurant would call for us to request the return shuttle. We asked for the shuttle via the restaurant and after 15 mins were informed the hotel was not answering the phones. I too tried calling, however no answer and I tried calling more than 5 times. So here we are, 9:30pm and the 2 kids are sleeping (long day, arrived on a 7am flight) and no shuttle. We decided to walk back after another 40 mins of calling and waiting. Not sure if you ever carried a ten year old and a 8 year old for over \u00bd mile in the dark after a long day, however its not fun. We get back to my room and called the front desk, no answer, bell desk no answer, we tried every extension and there was no answer? What the f%$? Where are these people? This is supposed to be a full service resort. Now my friends are already frustrated because we had to walk back, but now they have no ride back to the Tapatio Cliffs Resort. I called the front desk AGAIN and the manager on duty was useless. I finally talked to a bellman (10:30pm) and he tells us the shuttle doesn\u2019t run this late and is not guaranteed and we should have called earlier. Are you kidding me? We started calling at 9pm\u2026\u2026..So I had to call them a cab. We talked to an operator who basically could care less about our situation and was completely rude. She hung up on me because I asked her why an entire hotel staff was not answering the phone. I called back and told her what I thought about her and hanging up on me. During this fiasco I lost my cell phone, probably while carrying a ten year old on my back. I called the operator to get the number to the restaurant to see if they had my phone and she would not connect me, her quote and I swear this is 100% true was \u201cI am never going to let you talk to the restaurant\u201d and chuckled and then hung up on me. Are you freakin serious? I then tried calling the front desk and operator and AGAIN no answer. Anyway, I talked to the hotel Manager today and guess what he was? Useless. He said he read the report of what happened and the hotel operator said I was rude to her? Hmmmmmm, lets see. For $269 per night this is what you get. ZERO support A staff who does not answer the phone Stranded in the middle of the night Pay for cab fair Rude people Sorry if I was a little rude, how about you do YOUR JOBS and do what you say you are going to do, not leave guests stranded and I won\u2019t be rude. Anyway, I get up this morning and decide to go take a swim and sit in the hot tub. The pool area is a mess with beer bottles, cups, dirty towels everywhere. I am thinking what the hell has happened to this place, its like I checked into a Motel 6. I turn on the hot tub and no bubbles???? A worker walks by and says oh that\u2019s still broken? Still broken? How long has it been broken? Oh about a week. Then I decide to at least just soak in the hot tub, I grab the hand rail and it pops out of the hole and I almost fall. Enough is enough, I am going home\u2026. Anyway, do yourself a favor and stay away from this property, there are several others in the Phoenix area that are much nicer and have a staff that values customer service. Some of the staff is awesome here, however management is a joke and front line folks could care less about you or your stay.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tempe, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, but bring your own food.\u201d", "Author": "AZkittymama", "ReviewID": "UR26088931", "Content": "We live in the Phoenix area and took a \"spring break\" at this resort as an alternative to the Arizona Grand Hotel (formerly Pointe South Mountain), which also has a water park. This Pointe was a definite disappointment. The buildings look dated and shoddy, as it was constructed at a time when Phoenix construction standards were not very good. The HIlton chain has renovated the rooms (very nicely), given it a new coat of paint and there is a relatively new water park, but the rooms are still dark and the landscaping is not artistic enough to hide its age (as it is at the old Pointe South Mountain). The \"Wild West\" theme of the restaurants and other shops in the River Ranch water park area is also extremely dated, and I found it embarrassing (particularly as I live here). The best thing about the stay was the value. With 1 bedroom suites running under $200 and no parking or activity fees, they are quite competitive with other local resorts (especially as it is still \"high\" season). In addition there are tons and tons of coupons and special rates for everything from resort credits, to free ice cream, to kids' activities programs, to spa services, allowing you to save even more. We stayed in a standard double queen, 1 bedroom suite (with queen sofa bed). The room, aside from being dark, was a good size and well maintained. With three teenagers and a college student (all female) changing clothes several times a day, the housekeeping staff worked wonders at keeping the room tidy, clean and dry. The beds were comfortable, but a bit firm for my tastes. I liked that the bathroom/shower was separate from the sink area and that both were located between the two rooms. The rooms are attractive and comfortable (though not fancy) Unfortunately, however, the rooms are still dated in terms of available technology. You could rent an Internet connection for $11.95 a day, but wifi was only available in the common rooms (actually, the lobby). As the hotel is billing itself as business-friendly, and there are a lot of conferences booked in, they should conform to the industry standard and make free wifi available throughout the resort. The service staff were almost uniformly friendly and helpful (except for a couple of front desk staff - go figure!). Each staff member from activities staff, to spa, to room service and restaurant staff, to groundskeepers, looked you in the eye and welcomed you or asked if you needed help. The range of activities is good, but not outstanding. The water park is OK, but not exciting enough for our teens (the slide is long rather than steep). The spa services overall were good, the facials excellent, the mani-pedi not so much. There was a truly minimal fee to rent tennis rackets and balls, which was nice for the kids. There is also an \"Executive\" putting course, which we didn't use, and you could use the golf course at the Pointe's sister property (Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs). The gift shop was better than average, with an interesting range of items pertaining to the new and old West. And now to the worst, the absolutely worst, of the experience.... the food. Not content to merely be overpriced (as most resorts are), it was also horrible. The quesadilla I ordered through room service was way overdone, and the chicken on it was dessicated. Of four in-room pizzas, only one was good, the others were underdone and floppy. The other food was merely average both in conception and quality, certainly not up to any other premier Arizona resort in which I have stayed. The Hole in the Wall Restaurant also suffered from poor quality preparation and worse, poor quality ingredients. On one sandwich I got the avocados were brown and crusty and the iceberg lettuce (and almost all the lettuce used was cheap iceberg) was wilted. All our kids ordered off the Kid's Menu as the quality was no worse and the prices better than the regular menu. The last night we ate the their upscale Lantana Restaurant. It is really clear the recession has hit them hard. Although this is the tourist season there was hardly anyone there, and it appeared that it wasn't always open during the week (except for the Lounge). There were no specials, they didn't have the full menu available and a couple of the dishes were already sold out at 7:30 pm (as they apparently anticipated very few orders). Here, at least, the food quality was good (the ribeye was excellent), but there was no one there to appreciate it. Overall, the experience was a disappointing one for us since we have gone to much better (and not much more expensive) resorts in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. On the plus side, it is a great value considering it is a resort with a spa and water park, so if you are watching your money or just want to get away to the Valley of the Sun and don't have high expectations, you may enjoy it. Maybe try the two level casitas, which have double the space and include microwave, fridge and dining area. Hilton has an option where you can book a regular room and then request an upgrade on line. If an upgraded room is available on check-in, then you can get it for a substantial savings. However, I strongly suggest you contact the concierge for recommendations on local restaurants (we used his services twice and he was right on in terms of selecting the perfect restaurant for our cravings, budget, and family composition).

You can get anywhere within Phoenix quick. We went to Phoenix for a long weekend mainly to see the Indians in spring training, and to take my neices to the Grand Canyon for the day. We rented a 2-bedroom casita at the Squaw Peak - which wasn't cheap by any means, but I had stayed there 9 years ago, and remember the pools and thought they'd have a great time. We were disappointed by two things right off the bat - one that we only received a select number of passes (6 for a casita) and that the River Ranch was only open limited hours, 10-6, or at least that's what we were told by the front desk. We later found out it was really 9-7, but that's still very limited and wish we would have known that as we probably would have just stayed some place else with a regular heated pool and a regular room. I do have to say the landscaping is absolutely beautiful. From someone how loves flowers - I was blown away by the color and beauty. Outstanding. The casita was beautiful, plenty of room and well furnished. The 2nd bedroom was laid out strange, but it worked. It was nice to have the pools around the casita area, but by no means were they \"heated\" as they claimed they were. Our shower head was horrible, no water pressure and spit water at us instead of streaming. And the TV would blare sound when first turned out - scrared you to death every time it was turned on! We tried the River Ranch for only one day we were there as the other day was consumed by our day trip to the Canyon. The girls had fun at the Ranch, my husband and I played the mini golf, which I don't think you should have to pay extra to play. We already paid a fortune to stay there - they could throw in a round of mini golf. The mini golf course was poorly designed and confusing to say the least. Not much fun, but it passed the time I guess. Dinner at the Latina Grille was expensive and medicore. Although, there were coupons in the room we later found to help with the costs but we didn't go back. Just eat elsewhere - there are so many places in Phoenix to eat - but a car is essential.

The first night I was given a first floor room (queen) in North Pointe blgd. Not close to main lobby and room was not in great condition. Shower head was broken. I had asked for an upgrade as a faithful HH member but front desk said no rooms available which was contrary to bartender who told me 40% occupancy on Sunday? The remainder of stay was on the 3rd floor of South Pointe blgd, better room(king) overlooking pool area. Room was ok for a military rate but I would not pay more than that rate. An issue w/ front desk about a fax that was sent twice, but we were told initially was not received, manager quickly addressed problem and advised staffer was new an unaware of the fax log. Property has some maintenance issues, a set of elevators under repair for entire stay resulted in some waits. Blgds have some obvious wear issues, but saw work being done to correct and staff completing punch lists. Again it was a good experience for a reasonable rate.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201chuge prison block\u201d", "Author": "bazalUk", "ReviewID": "UR21834260", "Content": "If you like holiday camp settings youl like this hotel, the only area where you can get all day sun is arround the huge and noisy water park area. otherwise the smaller quieter pools have so much shade you can only get sun from 10.30----14.00 some of the king bed rooms have no sun at all and are very dark requiring room lights on all day, check your room before you book!!!

Our reasons for returning were the weather- UK has been s**te for the last 12 months, and we needed to relax and that last time, it wasn too bad! You can relax during the week, but Thursday pm through Sunday pm, dont even dream of peace and quiet- it is a resort and families do make the most of it! And dont make the mistake of thinking that when its busy, the resort might open the advertised water park earlier- it seems to be down to the \"discretion\" of the staff, which is random to say the least. Anyway, to be objective: Check in- was swift, but failed to identify or provide the appropriate vouchers for breakfast (identified as an issue on many reviews), and gave out of date \"value\" pack, which was worthless Room- no different from 5 years ago, although in the main block this time; Dusting is obviously a long forgotten art here, as is recognition of Diamond HH status- no benefit at all at this hotel River ranch- facilities good, but maintenance and consistency (water butts/cups etc,) hit and miss; Slim Pickens bar- \"you need it more than me budd!\" when leaving only $1 after having walked the length of the park, had a single beer poured and charged \u00a35.50 for it! I Dont get the tipping thing when the guy/gal has done F all for it!! Breakfast- eventually having managed to get our entitled vouchers, we began to regret it! Food at the Lantana is a complete lucky dip, which fits perfectly with the service! Dont even worry about the time, just dont think about what is going to turn up- you order white toast, guaranteed its brown; scrambled eggs and bacon appeared as poached and sausages! One day, not even given a plate- \"I thought I'd just put yours on your husbands!\" Another day, seated at a table with no waiter at all taking responsibility for it! Had to coerce a guy to help us to get served! Lunch- DONT GO to the Hole in the Wall! Food crap, overpriced and thats even before they try to rook you later by adding 50%, which takes days to fight! keep your receipts! Seems that the Cowboys are still around, now just outlaws! Dinner- didnt take the chance- too risky! Positives: The weather is great, the pools are well maintained, and most of the staff are friendly, if not necessarily professional. Housekeeping staff are patient and thorough, except for dusting! and the Tocasierra gym was excellent, with helpful staff and good facilities. Cabs- obviously the hotel has a kick back from the cab company they use- its impossible to get a sedan, always an SUV at 10% more, but also more thn the cabs from the Ritz (from Hilton to Biltmore- $25, from Ritz at Biltmore to Hilton- $18!! Dont bother booking- 5 years ago, booked, failed to turn up; Same this time! Recomendations- Shop at Basha and enjoy balcony snacks, supported by happy hour snacks from Lantina grill; Go to Elements at the Sanctuary for a good meal- a little pricey but the service and quality dwarf anything near Squaw Peak . Manager of Lantina- have buffet guests in one area- they need little assistance other than drinks top ups, and have continental breakfast set up so that one person can supervise (if you are that untrusting), but for goodness sake, make sure that people are served within 30 minutes of seating and get the order right!! Or employ people that like their work! Sounds like a harsh review! Would we come back- probably not due to the complete lack of understandng of customer service and value, but maybe, because there were a few that made it worthwhile- Felipe, the gardener at the top pool, Sam at front desk, and Patti our housekeeper, the gym staff, and some others whose names we didnt catch- the manager at the water ranch, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress on our first and last days.

We choose this resort as we were traveling with our daughter, son-in-law and small granddaughter and by the reviews written by others, this property seemed to be a good choice for kids. The property has recently been renovated and I enjoyed the warm colors of the resort's exteriors as well as the suite's colors & furniture. We had adjoining rooms; our's with a king bed and the other with 2 queens. After reading someone else's review I also requested suites in the South building (where the main lobby is) and this turned out to be great as the bedrooms didn't have the hot afternoon sun, but rather nice shady balconies. Our suites were just a short walk across the parking lot to the River Ranch. The beds were extremely comfortable..great Serta perfect sleeper mattresses, comfy pillows and soft sheets. The bathrooms were sparkling clean and nice idea to put the shower and toilet in one room and separate dressing room. The bath towels were very good quality, new and fluffy. The swimming pool area (by our suites & main lobby) was nice, with very comfortable lounge chair cushions. One complaint would be that the towels here & at River Ranch could use upgrading as they were really thin, small and not of the quality they should be for a Hilton resort and compared to the quality of the bath towels in the suites. The River Ranch was great. Plenty of lounge chairs throughout the area. The lazy river was fun and again plenty of tubes available. We rented a locker to store our personal items although we felt like the area was pretty safe when leaving sandals & coverups, etc. on the lounge chairs.Bring your own lock if you have one for the locker but we were able to purchase one for $5. The one area of the resort that did not meet our expectations were the on-site restaurants. We were warned of this on other's reviews but did try 3 restaurants for ourselves and were also disappointed. While the Slim Pickens grill in River Ranch makes excellent smoothies, they didn't seem to care at all that they never processed the burger part of the order. In fact the young man there was rather flip about his error when my husband asked for our money back. We also tried the Hole in the Wall restaurant for lunch. We were one of only 2 tables in the restaurant and the meal took which we considered borderline too long considering the order consisted of one sandwhich & fish and chips (Friday Fish Fry special). It was just ok. The waitress never came by the table to let us know of the meal's progress. There were several servers all walking around and talking to each other but it would have been nice to have gotten some attention ourselves. The biggest disappointment was the Lantana Grille for Saturday buffet breakfast. Our server took much too long to come to our table after we were seated, finally brought us OJ, but never stopped by again to ask us for a re-fill or anything else for that matter. The buffet was sub-par, with pastries that looked like they were packaged grocery store type, bagels were never replentished, lox never had tongs on plate, chaffing dishes were either empty or almost empty of hot items most of the time, eggs were over-cooked and dry. The cook in the special order (waffles, omelettes,etc.) area was incompetent....couldn't keep orders straight. Definitely needed help. What was amazing is that there didn't seem to be anyone overseeing the buffet at all. $16.95 per person for very poor quality buffet. Don't waste your money here! We found the staff around the whole resort very friendly. We had a little problem with something sticking out of the floor door frame in the area between our suites that cut my son-in-laws foot. I called housekeeping and someone showed up at our door within 5 minutes to fix the problem, so we were impressed with that. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby area but if you want it in your room, it's $11.95 for 24 hours. It would be nice if this was complimentary but this is the way it still is in many hotels. My husband used the fitness center and said the equipment there was very good. It was a very nice stay & we would stay here again...maybe next time we will try one of the casitas.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWorst Customer Service EVER!!!\u201d", "Author": "hkelly", "ReviewID": "UR19932357", "Content": "Upon check in there was a line out the door, they only had two people checking everyone in, when it was our turn it was a quick process, we got our keys and headed to our room. There are no inside corridors so that was a pain, but we were able to park right outside our building. The Luggage carts were chained to a fence so we had to call the front desk so they could send someone over to unlock them for us, very tacky as it was 100 + out and we just wanted to get into our room. We got to our \"smoke free\" room - finally...and it looked like it was recently remodeled, nice large rooms, and a bonus to have a separate bedroom from the living area. The room however smelled of old cigarette smoke (which I am highly allergic to), my guess is that at one time it was a smoking room. So thank goodness we brought Fabreeze with us and sprayed the entire room down, including the curtains (we had called the front desk and it sounded like that's all housekeeping would be able to do for us as well) The first morning we were there, we were awakened at 8:30 am by the front desk saying our credit card had been declined (how come we weren't notified upon check in), I knew this to be an error as I had PLENTY of room on my card...I told them I would call my bank and find out what was going on....upon talking with the credit card company the hotel had placed 5 authorizations on my credit card in the following amounts....$1183.00, $1183.00, $800.00, $600.00, and $500.00. They couldn't get my card to go through...NO WONDER, they froze up over $4,500.00 on my credit card, and anyone who knows anything about credit cards ( I worked in the banking industry for almost 10 years), when a company does an \"authorization\" it puts a hold on those funds for 5 -6 business days!!! until the charges are processed. So they maxed out my credit card. I called the front desk and they said that was impossible that that could not have happened, I told them, the $$$ amounts that the credit card company had told me they placed. I told them there is no way I would know the $$$ amounts if the money wasn't being held by them. To make a very very long story short, it took 4 hours that day to get it somewhat sorted out, my CC company told me I needed the Hilton to call them and remove all of the authorizations from my card, the front desk said they were not authorizations that my CC had been rejected those 5 times. It took 5 DAYS to get the messed cleared up and sorted out (funny how they had called my CC company and had those authorizations removed - but declined that that could happened), The hotel tried to tell us that our card was rejected at check in....I don't know about you but if it was rejected at the time of check in... 1. Why would you give us keys? 2. Notify us at check in that there was a problem with our card. 3. Ask if we wanted to put our room on another card. If our credit card was \"rejected\" the above should never have happened and we should not have spent our whole 5 days dealing with getting their \"authorizations\" removed from our CC so we could continue our vacation. We demanded that they compensate us for all the time and frustration they caused us and ruining our vacation and they offered us a free lunch (we paid for breakfast in our package deal but did not get breakfast that first day because of dealing with this so they offered us lunch instead) and $40.00 additional, we told them that wasn't good enough, that we felt at least one nights stay (we stayed 5 nights) was more acceptable, finally after arguing in the lobby they offered us an additional $50.00. Upon check out, on our final bill that is slipped under the door, there was a $75.00 charge for dinner (which we did not make) and there was only a $40.00 credit. OK can you say EXTREMELY UPSET at the unprofessionalism of this staff. It took another HOURS to get the $75.00 removed that we DID NOT CHARGE for dinner and to get the additional $50.00 that they told us would be credited to us. WE WILL NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN...we are telling everyone that this was the worst customer service we have ever received.

You cannot beat the location if considering staying in the Phoenix area. This is close to downtown (5mi), Scottsdale Fashion Square (5mi), Biltmore Fashion Plaza (3mi), great hiking (Squaw Peak - 1mi, Camelback mountain - 2mi), and freeway (1mi). Seems there has been some remodelling in the rooms since our last stay, as rough texture on walls has been smoothed out (popcorn ceilings still present though). Also added shade coverings on the balconies, which really helps with the intense afternoon sun. We always stay in Pointe South (this is a big property with suites and cabanas, Pointe South is where the main lobby is, there is also Pointe North with a seperate pool) in a non-smoking suite, next to the pool, room 2362. This is a king bedroom, with queen sofa bed. We were really pleased with the room, as normally always get 2 queen beds (rooms are a little bigger). Room on the East side (less intense afternoon sun). Furnishings look new, and very comfortable. TVs both worked, and bed was very comfortable with nice soft sheets and pillows. My wife is allergic to down/feathers, and was no problem having comforter and pillows changed. We also checked in at 12pm (4pm normal checkin) and checked out at 1pm 2 days later, with no questions or hassles or extra fees. We spent a lot of time at the lazy river and water slide. My wife preferred to hang out in the room, and relax. We did not check out the gym, although usage was included in package. There is an 18hole mini-golf which I played with my daughter. Also 4 tennis courts (no idea of pricing). Internet access is $12.00/day (in-room) but have free wi-fi in the lobby (which seemed to work in the patio area that liked to sit in.

There are a number of good restaurants within 2 miles. - Golden Dragon - very good Chinese, Northern/12th St (1mi) - TexAZ grill - excellent BBQ, 16th St/Bethany Home (2mi). - Sauce - modern Italian eatery - pizza/salad, Glendale/7th St - PeiWei - Asian food (PF Chang subsidiary), Glendale/7th St - Moto - Japanese, Glendale 16th St. - Aunt Chilada's - Mexican, soft chips (opposite hotel) - Carlos Obrians - popular Mexican food 12th St/Northern - Paradise Bakery - 12th St/Glendale (good bread, sandwiches) Fast food: - MacDonalds - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - Subway - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - NY Pizza - 12th St/Northern (0.5mi) - Stumpey's Pizza - 12th St/Glendale (deliver) - Papa Johns - 16th St/Glendale (deliver) - Pizza Hut - 16th St/Bethany Home (deliver) - Starbucks - 16th St/Bethany Home Grocery: - Bashas - 16th St/Glendale - Safeways - 7th St/Glendale There were a lot of people at the property but never felt too crowded, and swimming pools were kept very clean. I was a little suprised at how relaxed everyone was with the rules (lazy river and water slide). Maybe it is the end of the season, but in previous years were very strict on height for water slide and making sure used a tube on the lazy river. Hiking at Squaw Peak, 2mi to parking, 1.25mi 1000ft climb. Very popular hike, good parking. Get there early on weekends. Can also hike at Dreamy Draw Park which is on the North side of Squaw Peak, lots of trails, and easy 1mi drive from hotel. Camelback mountain, 3mi to parking. 1.25mi 1200ft climb. Two routes, East and West. Recommend West route, but limited parking at Echo Canyon, more parking 0.6mi away. Get there early on weekends. North Mountain. More gentle, can even take the paved road to the top. 7th St/Peoria, near Pointe Tapiteo (2mi). Cons: I got home and checked my bank account, and see a $360.00 deduction pending from my account from Hilton hotels (Hilton manage the Pointe hotels - there are three Pointe South Mountain, Pointe Tapiteo, and Pointe Squaw Peak). I knew my bill was only $283.00. I call and am politely told they put a hold on the hotel rate plus $50.00/day for incidentals, and should be credited back within 72hours of departure.

We never ate there for dinner, so I can't comment on the quality. Spa and health club - I am a runner but didn't do any exercise on this trip (unless you count downing margerita's).

Even with the bratty kids we still enjoyed ourselves, you CAN bring your own floats in the pools(and lazy river) along with drinks to the pools outside of the water park.

It had a king-sized bed(extremely comfortable), a shower & tub with the vanity outside of the bathroom and a fridge in the closet. There was a stinky smell coming from the sink but that was a minor issue. Nice flat screen on the wall. I do agree with other posters that you can really hear your neighbors, but that didn't bother us too bad. Restaurants - After reading the reviews on here we skipped the restaurants. We walked in the Hole In the Wall for breakfast on Friday morning and left after noone acknowledged us after 10 minutes. We were impressed with the pina coladas at the hotel bar; beer and drinks prices were average for a resort. We ate at Gallaghers Sports Bar (right off the property) twice and it was average bar food, nothing spectacular. I do highly recommend Barrios Cafe, a mexican restaurant on 16th that was fantastic - the area is a little shady, but the chicken enchiladas were worth it. Staff- Concierge was very nice and helpful. We tried calling the front desk several times from our room at different times and couldn't get through. When checking in the girl knew nothing, didn't explain where our room was.

I had spent a lot of time researching various hotels in the Phoenix area and settled on the Squaw Peak because it appeared to be quite \"kid friendly\" from what we read, including the reviews on TripAdvisor. Our kids, aged 8,10 and 14 had a great time. The lazy river and pools were a big hit, especially with our younger kids. The check in process went smoothly (we booked through United Vacation.com and got a great deal on the lodging as well as the flight from Denver) and we were given one of the standard rooms with a bedroom with 2 queens and a separate living area with a foldout sofa. When we checked in we were told to check back in a couple days about a possible upgrade. I did check back, and we did receive a room upgrade on about our third day at the resort. The upgraded room was a two story casita, with plenty of room for our family of five to spread out. Much nicer than the standard room. We stayed a total of 9 nights at the resort and truly enjoyed it. We had been concerned that the heat would be unbearable but as it was Phoenix was blessed with a few days of relatively cooler weather in late May before it started to warm up, gradually. Didn't really matter to us as we spent a lot of time around the pools. The breakfasts at Lantana Grille and the Hole in the Wall at the River Ranch were pretty good. We tended to go off-resort for other meals - there are some decent places to eat quite close to the resort. We did do dinner at the Hole in the Wall one evening but the service was terrible - in fact my wife and kids got tired of waiting for the food and left - we ended up eating it in our room. I used the fitness facilities at the Tocasierra Fintness Center a number of times and found it satisfactory, with plenty of equipment - although a couple of the treadmills were not very stable. My wife and eldest daughter also indulged with spa treatments, and although somewhat pricey, they did find them enjoyable. The River Ranch was the big hit of our vacation, and there was never a problem finding lounge chairs, towels, etc. - although getting service at your lounge chair on the weekend days can be a bit frustrating due to the volume of people. We also took the free shuttle over to the Tapatio Cliffs resort on a couple occassions. The main pool area at that resort is also quite nice, and I found the bar area actually a little livlier. The fact that we could use the facilities of both resorts is a real plus in my mind. I travel quite a bit both domestically and internationally, and while the Squaw Peak is a nice place, with decent amenities and mostly very good service, I would not rate it a premier resort. That said the \"value for money\" was excellent.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel-very big!\u201d", "Author": "Bodyandsoul", "ReviewID": "UR18519293", "Content": "We had a great room-no problems.

The blinds didn't work and the housekeeper kept moving our things around to where she wanted them. The resort itself seemed run down. The pictures made it look much larger than it is. A \"professional\" miniature golf course winds around the lazy river at River ranch and inner tubes covered the whole golf course. We, along with several other people couldn't even follow where the holes were. One minute you were on top of a hill, and the next minute you had to cross over a hole someone else was playing to get to your next hole. While we were there, they also had an adolescent basketball conference. Banging of doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs, and yes, one night some kids tried to break into our room. Unfortunately, I was in it! I chased them down the corridor and made sure they understood I didn't find their attempts funny. All, in all, not the most relaxing time.

When we checked in, the staff were NOT friendly, no one offered any help with baggage, and they did not give us the coupon book we were supposed to get or our $50 dinner coupons. Our room was okay, but the shower/tub did not drain. Our neighbors were packed about 20 to a room and there were constantly huge bags of garbage sitting out in front of their door. None of the elevators worked (we were on the 3rd floor) and none of the ice machines worked. The pool areas were nice enough - of course, when we got there, we couldn't get tubes for the lazy river because the pump to blow them up was broken. It just seemed like everything was broken or out of order. When we asked the person at the front desk about the coupons we never got and the dinner vouchers, he was completely unhelpful and pretty much told us, \"Sorry 'bout it - it was your responsibility.\" No, actually is wasn't my responsibility, I don't work there!!

We had a 3rd floor room with partial view of the pool. The rooms were perfect for a family. Two very comfortable queen beds, separated by a pocket door from the bathroom/toilet area, then doors again which separated the living area. This was perfect to put kids to bed and we could still watch tv. Also, my husband the snorer was kicked out into the living area/pull out couch so the rest of us could sleep and we never heard him. The balcony is so small and awful view, we didn't sit out there even once. I knew there was no refrigerator so we purchased a cooler at Walgreens right down the street and bought milk, juice, cereal and fruit so we didn't have to waste time or money going out to breakfast in the morning. We bought a big cooler and then just sent it home as luggage on the way home. The resort is very nice, well kept and beautiful. Very large palm trees and beautiful flowers. The pool area is also nice. The water temp was cool and several adults were complaining that it would have been nice to have it a few degrees warmer (it may have been 78 degrees or so). The water slide was very fast and the kids loved it. My kids also enjoyed the putt putt, though some of the holes could use a lift. We all played tennis one morning an d that was fun too. My major complaint about this place is that, I booked it due to the multitude of organized kids activities so that my husband and I could relax some. Apparently Spring Break had just ended in AZ so they scaled back on what they offered. There was a board posted at every hotel area indicating there would be pool activities every day at 10, 11, 1, 3, and 5 which included races, basketball games, water volley ball, slide races, watermelon eating contests, hoola hoop contests etc. Well we were there for seven days and there were two hoola hoop contests and one slide race. (that was it for the week). We continuously asked the pool staff when the next activity would be. They just had excuse after excuse. I realize Spring Break ended for them but the vacationers were on their Spring Break. My kids were very good at keeping themselves busy but after a few days it would have been nice if someone could have organized some activities for the kids. Even though I loved this place, this really irked me!!!!! We ate at the Hole in the Wall, very mediocre and pricey. The food at the pool was pricey. However, an adult sandwich was chock full of meat and kept all of us happy well until dinner. Most sandwiches were $9. Beers were $5 and up and mixed drinks around $8. We walked to Aunt Chiladas one night which was very good. Also Gallaghers across the street (pub food), sports bar which was good. Lantana Grille was very good. There are two hotel courtyards each with a pool and swim up bar. Both swim up bars were closed the whole week (also weird and disappointing), We enjoyed using these pools later in the day which was much quieter than the water park and very comfy chairs. AS there was no service here, we just packed a cooler and brought our own drinks,. No night life here to speak of. IN the past we have done an all inclusive vacation, where there is entertainment at night and then the adults sit around and socialize a bit. There was none of that here. The resort was quiet by 9:00. The fitness room is fantastic. New modern equipment, classes offered, it couldn't have been better. We went to the Grand Canyon one day and made it in 3 1/2 hrs. .

However, I was still able to enjoy the property. As a business traveler, it is important to me to be able to maintain a fitness routine. The Hilton Squaw Peak has a very nice fitness center and I didn't ever find it to be too crowded at peak evening hours. I was told that it was recently updated, so everything was in great shape. (Only suggestion I have for the hotel: balance your treadmills...a few were a bit wobbly on their legs!) Plenty of cardio machines and an extensive weight lifting area. Pretty great! Not to mention that you have access to Squaw Peak trails which is a nice bonus for the months when it is cool enough to be outside. The rooms are also quite large, which is great for being able to spread out. I had a suite on the ground floor near the pool / lobby. Even though there were lots of families who were up late, I didn't find it to be a distraction in my room.

The staff at both the family oriented \"Hole in the Wall\" and the fancier \"Lantana Grill\" kept trying to direct us to the pricey breakfast buffet. At the Hole in the Wall it was awful -- soggy french toast, cold eggs, a few pastries -- more like school cafeteria than good resort. (We DID love the Joshua Stone Band, local bluegrass group that plays Friday nights... worth seeing) The Lantana buffet was better, but more expensive... we would strongly recommend not buying the breakfast plan, and visiting some good local spots, like the \"5 & Diner\" nearby.

Our plane landed just before noon and, after a couple of grueling flights, my wife and I wanted to freshen up and eat a decent meal before seeing my folks. When I called the hotel, the front desk clerk was very helpful and confirmed that the suite they'd set aside for us was indeed ready, so we headed straight for the resort. Upon check-in, which was handled very smoothly, we were informed of the \"resort option package,\" which provides a number of amenities (including fitness center access, spa discounts, and local phone calls) for $2.25 a day. As Hilton HHonors members, we were also given two complimentary bottles of water. After freshening up, we headed to the Hole in the Wall Restaurant for lunch. This was a bit nostalgic for me, as I grew up in Phoenix and friends and I had frequented the Hole in the Wall at its original location in its early days. The food was (and still is) basic burgers, sandwiches, and quesadillas, but well prepared and reasonably-priced (especially considering it\u2019s in a resort). The service was also excellent. Thus fortified, we set off to see The Parents. Over the next several days, our two-room suite became our sanctuary. It included a separate living room and bed room, robes (without having to ask), a very comfy bed, the fluffiest towels I have used in a long time (at home or away), a balcony, a well-stocked mini-bar, and some of the best in-room coffee I've in a long time. While our room was in one of two multi-story buildings, the resort also offers \"casitas\" - single story structures away from the larger buildings and adjacent conference center. While the property has four restaurants, we only ate at the Hole in the Wall. However, we did use room service, which was also prompt, polite, and provided well-prepared fare. There are several pools available, including a small water park adjacent to the Hole in the Wall. And even though a fair number of kids were present at the hotel, it was overall very quiet.

Our boys loved it, the team running it was super accomodating, and totally on top of the little bundles of energy. Renting a car via the lobby desk was easy. Meals at the hotel were fine. Nice staff. The pool winds around so it is a bit difficult to know exactly where your children are at any given time if they are explorers (but overall it did seem safe). The resort is older so has its charm in that respect; it is not a new ultra luxurious over the top resort. The beds were comfy.

Only thing was the sofa was not a pull-out for the boys. So much for the upgrade - went to another King suite, but it overlooked some roadwork and looked like we would trip over the boys so went for a 2 queen suite, 1st one offered was not 2 queens, and with the bell - hop hanging in there found us a 2 queen that we couldn't of been more pleased with. Overlooked the courtyard pool and was on the 4 th floor. Only a few areas have a 4th floor and it was very peaceful. My partner is a HH gold vip so 2 breakfast coupons were included each day. The children's menu at both restaurants is very, very reasonable and plentiful. They have a lot of patio seating but very few umbrellas which is sad as it was too warm to sit in the full sun. We ate at Hole in the Wall our first night - convenient. It had a fire - pit that people were taking advantage of. They now have a resort special for $2.25 a day which includes an extra water park pass per day (not that anyone checks) and local phone calls which i'm using to connect to the internet rather then pay the $9.95 per day use! Pools were fine for the children, oh and fee includes the mini golf now. can't really sit in one spot and see the children all the time, so we found ourselves up and down looking for them even though they are 9 and 13 yrs! In a push we'd come back again but would like to try some other resorts. went to the Different Pointe of View for thanksgiving dinner - what a view, definitely recommended.

Everyone enjoyed this river slide and the scenery is also wonderful. The kids didn't want to leave. Since we were halfway to the south rim of the Grand Canyon, we decided to go and catch the sunset. On the way, we called inside the park for a hotel room and got lucky. Incredible!!! Pictures can't do it justice. The next day, we took the in-park tour buses at no extra charge - although, the national parks should be free for US citizens, since we pay taxes. we left midday and drove back to Phoenix. A few days later, we made another day trip to Slide rock again. On the way we went to Montezuima's Castle and meteor crater (pretty cool but not worth the $38 for 2 adults and 2 chilldren over 2).

The waste basket in the powder room had a very narrow opening and in my opinion, wasn't very effective.

However, I felt like the map of the campus was really not to scale since we had to drive all over looking for the Spa and Salon the following morning and hoping we weren't late to out appointment. The building for the Spa and Salon was not signed very well and with the construction going on it was difficult to manuever around the campus. The Spa and Salon was a treat and the staff was very welcoming and made both myself and my sister feel well taken care of and pampered. The Cranberry/Apple ice tea they offered us was delicious.

My only complaint, and it's a minor one, pertains to my observation that many people at the pool were not staying at the hotel. According to my Phoenix friends, resort-crashing is common, but the result was that during the hottest part of the day, the pool was almost unbearably crowded. As a corollary, I had a very tough time finding a place to sit by the pool, as towels covered all the lounges. I was not swimming, just wanting to watch my son, and most of the time I sat on the edge of the pool because all the chairs were reserved--even though no one ever came to sit in them. It was annoying, and since the pool management doesn't seem to care about this practice, my advice to anyone planning to stay at the PHSPR is to show up when the pool opens and place towels on at least twice as many chairs as you think you might need.

They (and we) think the best part is the Coyote Camp - the childrens program. The Camp is very profesionally run and every day offers different activities centered on Arizona and its culture.

My children ages 8 &10 met a lot of other children and enjoyed all of the activities they had going on. Some examples of the activities are: water balloon toss, water slide races, musical chairs and a watermelon eating contest just to name a few. I am not sure if they always have so many activities going on or if it is because it was the week before Easter (spring break) but my kids had a blast participating in them. Also, the college age guys/girls running the activities were super nice!! Winners even won prizes which were tickets for free smoothies at the snack bar. This was a good deal because if you paid for them they were $5 In the back of the gift shop there is a candy counter/icecream shop. Get your sodas there... a lot less expensive and a lot bigger. We ate lunch both days by the pool ordering from the snack/pool bar. The food was expensive and pretty good. We know what resort prices are and were not surprised. Unfortunately we did not get to eat at Hole in the Wall restaurant (my daughter became sick on the trip) We did order pizza from \"Streets of New York\" which delivered to the resort and was excellent.

Was told that it would be open until 7:00 pm. When we arrived at 4:00 pm, I asked the bellman to verify the Ranch hours, he also said it would be open until 7:00 pm. Well guess what? After rushing to check in, rushing to our room to change, running to the Ranch using a map that the bellman gave us so we wouldn't get lost on this vast property, the RANCH WAS CLOSED!! We were very disappointed (especially my 12 year old son whom I booked this for). I complained to the front desk manager, who told me that the Hilton is not responsible for the information that is given by the reservation agents since they are not on site!!! When I asked about the bellman's lack of correct information, the manager said that he would \"talk to him\". What a joke!! Besides the issue with the Ranch, this facility is very old and is in serious need of updating. The regular pool area with the swim up bar (which we went to after we could not get into the Ranch) was cold; the jacuzzi jets did not work and the jacuzzi water was colder than the pool; and the pool attendant did not speak English and was unwilling to find someone to help us. Also, there were numerous breakfast trays sitting on the walkways that led to our room; and there is a huge gap between the walkways and the stair railings which could be extremely dangerous for a young child. On a positive note, the inside of the room was updated, clean and a good size. Everything in the room was operational and well maintained. The beds, though, were too soft for my liking. Be sure to ask for the \"newly renovated area\" when booking ( I would hate to see the unrenovated rooms)! All in all, a very disappointing experience at the Hilton.

The reason for my trip was the annual \"getaway with the girlfriends\". Upon arrival, I was checked in promptly and driven by golf cart to my casita. The property is expansive and a huge plus is the willingness of the bell staff to show up w/ a golf cart to transport guests from place to place. In fact, I arrived in Phoenix in the a.m. and my friends, who rented the car, didn't join me until later in the day. The bell staff actually drove me by van to the local Walgreen's and drove me back when I completed my shopping. I will say that my original casita was a bit shabby...carpet worn and frayed, smelled musty and there was no dresser or proper closet in the bedroom. I had booked the casita based on the hotel's in-house reservation agent's description and it never occured to me to ask, \"is there a dresser and a traditional closet in the bedroom?\" I immediately called the front desk and I must say that the manager was MOST ACCOMODATING and not only changed my casita to a much nicer location, but offered an upgrade of an additional adjoining bedroom. Suffice it to say, the three of us were most comfortable during our stay w/ the two bedrooms. I found out later that the casitas are due for renovation next month (April '07). I'm glad I brought to the manager's attention the shabbiness of the first casita, especially because we were paying seasonal rates. It was nice reflection on the property that the manager \"did the right thing\" to accomodate guests. The property was beautiful and very well maintained. It was a bit cold to swim but the \"water park\" is great and I would highly recommend this property for vacationing families, singles and business travelers. There is a Convention Center attached and the property was filled to capacity, but one never had the perception that it was \"packed\" due to the fact that the property is so spread out. The onsite restaurants (only two) are well-staffed and the food is \"very good\" which is just below \"great\". The room service crew erred quite a few times during our stay which was disappointing but they always strived to correct the problem. Also a DVD player was delivered w/o the remote, so a new one was delivered the next day and there was no charge. Although mistakes were made (shabby first room, room service omissions, DVD player w/o remote), EVERY EFFORT was made to correct the problem so as to make the customer happy. A final comment is the workout/spa facilities. The workout room is fantastic and has long hours of operation. The \"spa\" has very delightful technicians and the services were all quite satisfactory but it is definitely NOT A SPA. It is a beauty parlor w/ a few private rooms and a few showers. There is one chaise lounge in the ladies room that faces a wall and a dusty silk plant. In my opinion, any facility that calls itself a \"spa\" should at least have a \"relaxation room\" w/ a few sofas or lounge chairs. Again, the technicians delivered their services beautifully, but for the prices charged, this customer wants to bask in a true spa atmosphere before, during and after treatment!! I would recommend staying here, but don't expect a \"top notch, well-appointed\" room or spa even if you are paying $300+ per night. All employees and managers were exceptionally friendly and helpful (except one front desk clerk who asked, \"what do you want me to do?\" when we called because there was no remote w/ our dvd player)! I will consider staying here again as it is conveniently located near the airport, highways, restaurants and shopping, yet it feels a bit \"secluded\" due to the beautiful terrain and mountainous backdrop.

A really nice, large facility with clearly devoted staff and fun art projects and other endeavors (including a hunt for arrowheads that the staff had taken the time to scatter in the mountainous hills ahead of time). A couple recommendations if you go: be aware that the casitas, while two floors, have no doors at all closing the upstairs from the downstairs. So if you want to have any \"private\" time with your spouse, your kids will be well within earshot. I think I might have preferred to have stayed in a large room in the main hotel for this reason. I read another review about lackluster maintenance here and we had a problem with a clogged heating filter that banged all night long when our neighbor's heat/AC ran (every 10 minutes). But, to the Hilton's credit, they were very apologetic and made the appropriate compensation to us when I reported it. What else? I had a superb tennis lesson from Paul Dean, the tennis pro. The Saturday yoga class was also good. The spa services we had were good, but not excellent. If you really like spa treatments, I would recommend driving to one of the more upscale resorts (the Biltmore or the Phoenician) for those.

I found the hotel to be a great value at around $65.00 per night. The lodging consists of two four story towers designated as north and south, and a large number of two story \"casitas\". My accomodations consisted of a two room suite in the south tower. It appears the two tower buildings are at least 30 years old and are in need of some cosmetic touch ups on the exterior. Signs of aging are apparent on parts of the stucco and tile roofing. However, the fourth floor suite I was assigned had been recently updated and was quite acceptable for the price. The bed was fantastic, very comfortable, and although the bedroom and bathroom was small, it was cozy and the balcony afforded a nice view of the nearby mountains. (Keep in mind all suites do not offer a view of the mountains). I ate three times at the \"Hole in the Wall\", and found it to be great. The food was excellent and priced reasonably for a Hilton. This is not your fancy food, but offerings such as Country fried steak for dinner ($13.50), and barbeque brisket sandwich at lunch ($9.25), were delicious and the portions were huge. My server, \"Belle Starr\", offered exceptional service, was extremely friendly and remembered my name each time I dined there. She was typical of the great service I encountered at the hotel. The true centerpiece of this resort is not the accomodations or the restaurants, but the huge water park located on site. It is sprawling and very impressive and would be a dream come true for kids of all ages. Even in December, when the daytime temperatures were in the 50's, I saw kids in the water. Another plus is the close proximity of the Hilton Squaw Peak to the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, a quick 3 mile drive to the east. The preserve offers ample opportunity for hiking and getting close to nature and the hike to the top of squaw peak offers breathtaking views of the valley below. In closing, I found the Hilton Squaw Peak resort a great value for the price I paid, but keep in mind if you are looking for a brand new property, you will be disappointed.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Thodin", "ReviewID": "UR6313093", "Content": "We stayed for a week in july 2006.

My girlfriend and I stayed in this fine resort for 4 days in early Oct. We found most of the reviews to be very true and accurate. Rather than sharing useless details about our stay, I will instead provide you with suggestions on how you can enjoy your stay to the fullest!. Hopefully these suggestions will make your trip as successful as ours. #1 - Request a remodeled room upon making your reservation. The remodeled rooms contain new everything! Our room was AWESOME! We checked out some rooms that had not yet been remodeled, at the same price, and were so thankful that we had made this request (thanks to other reviews on tripadvisor.com). #2 - Request a fridge upon checking in. This cost us nothing and proved so nice to have. #3 - Take advantage of the free shuttle system. Upon request, the bell desk granted us free shuttles to the Fashion mall and the Squaw Peak Summit. They were EXTREMELY courteous and very informative. Assuming you are at all adventurous and enjoy the outdoors, I cannot say enough good things about the Squaw Peak Summit climb. 1.5 miles, 1200 feet up, and so very very beautiful! The other climbers are VERY friendly and the view is to die for. Be sure to bring your camera and plenty of water! #4 - Eat at Hole In The Wall! The food is fantastic, VERY reasonable, and the service is professional and timely. We ate there each day. Dominic was our waiter and VERY friendly! #5 - Take advantage of the concierge. We knew very little about the area that we were in along with the attractions that were nearby. They are VERY helpful and will provide you with an array of attractions, availability, prices, recommendations, etc. #6 - Lastly - plan on making a trip to the Walgreens or any local grocery store on the first day. The water in the room is a complete rip off ($6 a bottle) and the drinks at the pool ($9 for a weak mixed drink) were about the only negatives that we could come up with. After the first day we stocked up on water and bought some liquor at the grocery store in order to make this trip more affordable and enjoyable.

We stayed for five days and were able to get a complimentary upgrade (w/our Hilton rewards points) to a one bedroom (2 story) casita, which is perfect for families with 2 or more children. The River Ranch is wonderful for kids and adults alike.....the slower paced lazy river is for those that just want to float in inner tubes and the waterslide is for the kids or adults that want to go faster. This time of year is usually hotter in AZ, thus the water park is even more relaxing. They have an extremely accomodating staff, very friendly and helpful, we just had to watch that our bill was accurate (quite a bit of accidental over-charges). The \"Hole in the Wall\" restaurant is great. My kids love ordering the rattlesnake ($18) dinner and you can roast s'mores right at your table ($10). I recommend their Arizona style bloody mary's to drink, served with olives, pepperocini's. and extra spice...very tasty. We took the free shuttle service up to their sister resort (Tapatio Cliffs) about 10-15 min up the mtn, and enjoyed the pools there one day. Tapatio Cliffs seemed a bit more \"upscale\" than Squaw Peak..much more \"adult only\" pools, nice cushions on the pool chairs, etc., but my kids and I had fun swimming and relaxing by their lagoon style pools as well. They also have an enclosed water slide at the cliffs .....both places are nice resorts, and its convenient to be be able to shuttle between them. Coyote Camp is a great place to drop off your kids for desert- themed arts/crafts/activities, etc (ages 5-12 yrs) and it costs about $10 per hr per child.....worth it in my opinion. My daughter, now 10 yrs, has been going to Coyote Camp 3 yrs in a row , and this one of her favorite things to do at the resort. The staff at Coyote Camp is always warm, welcoming and accomodating to my kids and some of the staff have been there 15 years. They love what they do. We also visited the Phoenix Science Center in downtown Phoenix and stayed 3-4 hours.....I highly recommend it....we ate a lite lunch at the Victorian Tea House, next door to the Science Center afterwards..and that also is a good place to eat, they even have a children's menu. You can spend some $$ is you order poolside, each non-alcoholic drink is $2.50 for soda/tea and you pay by the glass/cup...for instance, each time I wanted a glass of iced tea, I paid for it, no free refills, so that can definitely add up, but it is convenient to sit by the pool and have someone bring you drinks/food, etc. Otherwise, great trip all around, and summer is the best time to go, because the rates are so cheap...we definitely recommend the Hilton Squaw Peak or Tapatio Cliffs to anyone, especially families.", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cgreat time\u201d", "Author": "vacations_are_fun52", "ReviewID": "UR5621411", "Content": "Went for 2 nights with our two girls, ages 9 and 11.

Resort was available and inexpensive as we needed a place to stay before moving into another resort in Scottsdale. Resort located in midst of city, surrounded by heavy traffic roads, etc, though we could not hear any road noise due to the landscaping and how the rooms faced inward to a pool area. Room had a separate two queen bed bedroom, TV, bureau, credenza and closet - no security safe though. Odd shape of room led to the use of a pocket door instead of a regular door, plus one bed partially blocked the door exit. Otherwise, the bedroom was fine. \"Patio\" which was a sliding door off the bedroom looked out into the pool and the neighboring hallway. Just enough room for two chairs - useful only to dry your swim suit. Bathroom split with toilet, tub/shower in one room and sink/countertop in an open area next to the bedroom. Living room had a sofa, chair, chair/desk, TV stand, mini-bar fridge/counter with coffee maker. Minibar was stocked with usual minibar overpriced drinks/snacks. We asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was delivered later in the day. Furniture looked fine, but the carpet was a bit dated. Room was fine, though worn. Parking was far from the room and no easy path to get the luggage to the room. Initial day the elevator was broken, requiring lugging everything to the second floor by hand. By 2nd day, elevator was functional. Grounds were well maintained and manicured greenery. Best asset of the Pointe was the water park (passes for each hotel guest) and the quieter smaller pools in two of the hotel complexes. Hotel pools were well maintained, plenty of towels, chairs, cleaned pool, kiddie pool, whirlpool, chilled water cooler/cups. Water park was typical - lazy river, sports pool - volleyball, regular pool with water falls. Too busy for our needs, so we visited only once to see what was offered. Adjacent grill provided food. Food was typical grill food with children's menu. Room service was offered, though we did not partake. All, in all the stay was slightly above average. Did not see any cockroaches or other bugs.

June 19 stay: We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30 p.m. and with 3 kids they were ready to get in the pool and relax after a long day of traveling. Upon check in we were not greeted just checked in. We were given a key and led to the appropriate parking lot for our building and pointed in the direction of our room. We carried our own luggage down a dark hallway to the last room. The room was ok but not worth the price we paid. The smoke detector was hanging from the wall with wires hanging from the wall, we were not sure if it worked or not?? With that said we quickly changed and headed to the pool. It took us a good 10 minutes to find the pool. Once we found it we noticed 3 families leaving the ares with their children. A few minutes later I realized why they were leaving. There were 3 young adults clearly drunk and acting very loud and obnoxious. They were drinking and some very inappropriate behavior between the famale and male was happening in the jacuzzi area. I told my kids to stay at our end of the pool since they really wanted to swim. A few minutes later the young males climed on top of the pool bar's roof and started jumping into the pool. I finally decided to call the front desk and was assurred they would send security. 10 minutes later I called again because no security personnel ever came to the pool area. Another 10 minutes and 6 security personnel officers arrived. The young adults were bad mouthing the security and refusing to get out of the pool. It turns out that they were not even guests at the hotel. A little later 2 of the families that left earlier returned with their kids to swim in the pool. Where were those security officers and why were they not wlking the grounds. The next morning we left the grounds to have breakfast in town not realizing that the hotel offered children eat free with the purchase of an adults meal. Thats because we were not told anything upon check in, no information about the hotel, no information about the specials, and no map or information about their Hole in the Wall water park. I complained about all of the above to Guest Relations and was told I would hear from the General Manager of the Hotel. I only received a call from the Head of Security explaining that the young adults were escorted off the hotel grounds, which was information I already knew. That was the only response I received and the only issue I addressed. I called the Guest Relations again to inform them that I had not heard a response from the Hotel's General Manager and was told that I received a call from the Head of Security addressing my concerns. I told Customer Relations this was not true and filed another complaint. Which led to our discounted stay on June 28, which was just as bad. We were offered a 50% discount to stay again. We were given a room facing the courtyard, seemed nice and as if they were attempting to make up for the bad service we previously experienced. We went to the pool and enjoyed a nice quiet time until we got into the ice cold jacuzzi and no one to help fix it. We went back to our room to take showers and questioned if the bathroom/room had been cleaned or cleaned and then used??? The bathroom had a used towel hanging on the back of the door and hair on the floor and in the shower on the tub and shower curtain. I was so angry at this point I just wanted to leave but it was 11:30. We got ready for bed and as my daughter pulled down the sheets to her bed she discovered hair strands between her sheets....she almost threw up and was on the verge of tears because she didn't want to sleep in it. The next morning I decided to take the kids to the Hole in the Wall Water Park attached to the hotel and discovered the mail pool was closed. After an hour or so I walked down to see if it was open. I saw bugs floating in the pool. These were roach type bugs that were huge. They were so big I had to ask if they were real or a childs toy. They were real. There were grounds keepers and maintance workers running around all morning so I didn't know what was going on. Now I know there are bugs everywhere but if they had sprayed I think they should of opened later or scooped the bugs out of the pool right away. I was scared to let my children in the pool because I didn't know if there was chemicals in there or what. The bugs were also floating in the lazy river......YUK! At this point I just wanted to run as fast as I could from this place. The water park staff was rude and no one there was helpful. I again called the Guest Relations to complain and was told that I would hear from the General Manager of the hotel. As of today July 4, I have not heard a word from anyone.

The propery was very well kept. The only problem was the pool area where we were located. Each area has its own pool. During the first few days of our stay, the pool was in disarray every morning. Towels were not picked up and food and beverage containers were still everywhere from the night before. About Wednesday, things changed and the pool area was spotless. Possibly the person in charge of the pool was on vacation at the beginning of the week. Another problem with the pool was a private company giving swimming lessons to small children. After a day of being in conferences, it would have been nice to just get into the pool, but that wasn't always possible. Last, there are no pool rules posted and children were throwing balls, diving into the pool (there was a no diving sign), and many just being obnoxious. No real parenting going on there.

We wanted a \"fun\" place to take him and this looked like it was it. After booking, I became concerned after reading some of the TripAdvisor reviews. Having stayed in a number of Hilton properties, I can tell you that if you have children, this is the place to go. The River Ranch has multiple pools, a long lazy river for use with pool-supplied inner tubes, a water slide, and a kiddie pool. Neat waterfall for kids and adults to play in. There is also a hot tub at the River Ranch. Food at the River Ranch outdoor bar is the same price as any pool resort-a little pricey, but not outrageuos. But there are plenty of \"water stations\" at the pool with large containers of free cold water and plenty of cups along side. The only aspect that bothered me is that through the week, it closed at 8 pm. I thought that too early-especially with the temp hitting 112 degrees... The Hole in the Wall restaurant at the River Ranch was good and the prices were very reasonable. We did not play the miniature golf only because it was too hot, but it looked fun. We stayed in a regular suite with 2 queen beds, and it was fine. Very comfortable bed. No, you could not put personal items in the fridge, but we bought a styro cooler down the street at Walgreens and kept it filled with ice from the ice machines located on every floor. If you are eating outside the resort, you will need a car. You can walk to Aunt Chiladas (good Mexican food-neat atmosphere- very reasonable prices-good margaritas -you can purchase your own shaker to take home!) Other than that, you will need to drive. Good choices are Claim Jumper (good prices- kid friendly-neat menu choices-to die for 6 layer chocolate cake..it is a 10 dollar dessert, but feeds a host of people!) Another fun place to take kids is the 5 & Diner. (Juke box at every table, milk shakes served in the stainless shakers-terrific food real really reasonably priced..) Pizza was good and inexpensive at Streets of New York. We were only there for 4 days, so we did not go on any tours or day trips. But our grandson enjoyed the pools so much that it did not matter to us that we did not go anywhere else. After the pool closed at 8 pm, he could swim in our south-end pool complex. I thought the water was cloudy in the hotel complex pool, but he enjoyed it anyway. I was looking forward to using the hotel complex hot tub after the River Ranch closed, but the first night, it was ice cold! It was warm the remaining nights, though... We did check out the Hilton Tapatio Resort also in Phoenix. Again, if you have kids or are an adult that likes water play, stick to Squaw Peak! I did think the pricing for the Squaw Peak kids \"Coyote Camp\" was too high. But since our grandson was perfectly happy making friends in the River Ranch water area, we did not use the Camp. The River Ranch is open later on Fri and Sat nights-they show an outdoor kids movie on Sat nights. The kids can swim and watch a movie at the same time-that was kinda cool... It did bother me that there were no safes in the rooms-that needs attention!! And a 10 dollar a day charge for internet service was ridiculous-I would not and did not pay for that-even thought I took my wireless laptop with me. Sorry, but that should be free!!! The staff was friendly and they all took a few moments and chatted with our grandson whenever he wanted to show them his latest purchase from a gift shop or needed scotch tape or glue for something he was working on..(Much appreciated, staff!) And the lady at the 3rd floor kids concierge played a board game with him one hot afternoon-thanks! And the hotel concierge in the lobby really knew the area and what to recommend. He printed a map for us one night when we asked directions for an eatery. And they will print your boarding passes for you the day before you leave-that was a great help to us! I do think they need more handicapped parking. My husband requires handicapped parking, and it was always hard to find one available-especially during the weekend. But all in all, we had a really fun time just swimming, exploring the resort complex, trying out new restaurants-just spending some quality family time together. It was very relaxing and my grandson is ready to go again next year.

I typically to do a lot of research before we go on vacation, because elements of a vacation--like the quality of the hotel--can make or break the entire trip. I must admit that I was a bit nervous about reserving a room at the Squaw Peak Resort because there were some mixed on-line reviews. Some people reported poorly lit rooms. Others said the property was dated. One review said that it had \"those kind of people,\" though I'm not exactly sure what that meant. So, here is the scoop...This place is not a Four Seasons, nor is it the Phoenician. It, however, does not charge 5-Star resort rates either--we paid $161/night AAA rate for a true suite with a separate bedroom. With respect to quality of the accomodations, the Squaw Peak Resort is in line with an Embassy Suites hotel. The hotel caters to both conventioniers and famlies. This diversity is made possible because the hotel's River Ranch water park area (a very nice family-oriented swimming pool(s) recreation area) is separated from the hotel buldings by the parkng lot. For the most part, this separation keeps the families away from the business people, who have their own, less ornate pools in their respective hotel wings. Overall, the grounds are very pleasant, and the River Ranch area is very nice. The Lazy River, which is a swimming pool that allows you to float in an innertube around the property, is fun and highly relaxing. The photos I have seen of the Lazy River really don't do it justice as it is pretty expansive and the scenery is diverse too. The food in the pool area is solid and the service at \"The Hole In The Wall\" Restaurant borders on excellent. As a matter of fact, everyone at the hotel is very friendly and courteous. The hotel also has a great work-out area (available to guests for a small fee)--much better than the standard hotel gym--with an extensive weight room and a separate aerobics room. I did not try any services at the adjacent spa, but that looked decent too. Like all things in life, there are things to complain about. I noticed the first few days that a lot of the inevitable litter (drink cups, etc.) that people leave around the multiple swimming pools didn't get cleaned up by the hotel staff--This was epecially true of the Lazy River, where the same crushed can of beer lingered for days on a wall around one of the bends. A small complaint is that the hotel is not walking distance to anything in particular. As a result, you really need a car if you want a change of scenary. It is about a 15-25 minute drive to Scottsdale which has great shopping, dining, and people watching. The second item isn't so much a complaint as it is a concern...What would this place be like during spring break? We went during the low season, when most kids are in school, so the resort wasn't very crowded. But, the staff told me that during spring break, and during the summer when highly discounted rates are available, that the place is really hopping. The River Ranch is big, but not that big, so one's stay would probably be a lot less relaxing during those times. My bigger wonder, however, has to do with drinking age \"kids\", as I could see a mix of college kids and little kids would be poor in a place that serves alcohol pool-side. Overall, the Squaw Peak Resort offers a great family value for the dollar. My six year-old thought it was on par with Maui and Disneyland as a vacation destination--pretty high praise.

We have relatives that paid the same at a basic Best Western and they didn't have near the pool areas that we had. We had a great pool right by our room and when we wanted a change we wandered off to the River ranch, something my children enjoyed thouroghly.

If you are bothered by small children (and their noises) DON'T GO TO A FAMILY RESORT THAT BLATANTLY ADVERTISES THAT IT CATERS TO CHILDREN! Stay at the Doubletree at the airport. However, this isn't an over the top Hilton Resort- we've stayed at much nicer. We had a one room King Suite on the 2nd floor, overlooking a pool/courtyard. For $400 a night we were disappointed in the service and amenities but overall the stay was pleasant. The sofa bed in the living room was a queen size sofa bed with a full size sofa bed mattress (in other words, it left about a foot of exposed bed frame). VERY unimpressive, and dangerous for children! The bathroom was not fantastic- it was a bit small, but the living room/bar area were adequate, and the walk behind wet bar was convenient for placing ice/drinks in the sink. The pool/hot tub in our courtyard were great at night. The River Ranch pool-resort area closed every day at 5, which seemed too early. We had room service which was actually quite good (probably some of the best room service food we've ever ordered). We ate at the Lantana Grill 2 mornings in a row- the second morning the staff was incredibly rude and the food absolutely disgusting (the egg white spinach omelette was bathed in oil and slithered onto the plate and served with what I suppose they were trying to pass as sun dried tomatoes). We had breakfast another morning at the \"Hole in the Wall\" which was EXCELLENT, the staff was friendly, the atmosphere relaxed, and the food was a million times better than the Lantana Grill. We are Diamond members, we were given free water bottles (the $6 per bottle price they want other guest to pay was a bit shocking) but in order to redeem the water bottles you had to go to the gift shop- no big deal, but leave the water bottles in the room already! Poolside service at the River Ranch was decent. The gift shop was nice and convenient. The staff didn't turn \"on\" the \"Lazy river\" two days in a row- we finally asked about it and they said they \"thought it was on\". It was finally working for the rest of our stay. The kid pool area was fantastic and the large shallow end in the main pool was even better. It was very quiet and peaceful as we were there during the week. We felt welcomed with our 2 1/2 year old despite some large business gatherings that were also going on. The Coyote Ranch for kids is for older children but they offer a wonderful \"kiddie concierge\" with books and toys that you can check out during your stay. Helpful if you don't pack the whole toy chest in your luggage. We plan on going back next month for a few days of R & R (and yes, we're brining our child- so STAY FAR AWAY if you hate children!) but we did write a letter about some of the issues. We also booked a casita which I think should be more comfortable.

I'm pretty much in overall agreement with that reviewer's comments. The rooms are dark and average (ours smelled so strongly of room freshener it was nauseating). The decor is standard Hilton hotel room; nothing imaginative or interesting. If you came with kids, you'd probably appreciate the pools and activities. We don't have kids, and aren't really into the Disney-themed plastic decoration (including a fake old western town store front theme). I thought the price of $200 per night was pretty high for what you got. The spa is, in my opinion, very misleadingly described as one of the 10 best in Arizona. I don't know what list they are working with, but I can't imagine that is the case. I booked a $165 massage. The massage itself (by Ron) was quite good. But for that kind of money, there's usually a pretty nice spa experience that goes along with it. In this case, I checked in, and the girl at the counter didn't even offer to take me to a locker room and give me a robe! I had to ask for that. The locker rooms are your regular gym-type locker room. There is a co-ed steam room and sauna. No whirlpool. After I saw a man in the steam room stretching his hamstrings in full workout gear (including gym shoes), I wouldn't have gone in the steam room if you paid me! The showers are badly in need of an overhaul -- mildewed, no water pressure. The waiting room is basically on a sofa in the beauty salon -- strong smell of nail varnish. During the massage, the table rocked throughout (it needed some sort of repair), and everytime water turned on in the hair salon you heard it loudly. One nice place to hike -- the Phoenix Mountain Park (east on Glendale past Highway 51). Great nice hikes -- although you have to drive about 10 minutes to get there.

We checked in early, had a very nice suite (asked for non-smoking, king, and not first floor and all were accomodated). Also got a $90 (+tax, etc.) per night rate on Pricline so that was a bonus. Pros- nicely kept grounds, friendly staff, great pool. We do not have kids (I'm 8 months pregnant actually), but we still enjoyed the place very much as a couple seeking a final pre-kid escape. Our room was quiet, the pool(s) were spacious enough for all comers on a holiday weekend during high season, and our bed was absolutely wonderful. We're not typical resort folk (more the bargain hunting type), so this place was a wonderful treat for us. We also had a rental car- if you didn't you might be limited as there's not much close by except the hotel restaurants and shops. Minor cons- the suite has a nice kitchenette but the small fridge is locked and overstocked with items for charge-- the hotel information says \"do not store personal items in the fridge due to spoilage concerns\" or something. That's a bit ridiculous. We never opened it for fear of excess charges. It would have been nice for us to be able to use the kitchen for easy breakfasts, and keep our own milk and oj and leftovers in the fridge. Also, the remodeled Lantana grill has no atmosphere and is overpriced. Our beef satay appetizers were great but the quesadilla we ordered was horrible. I'm glad we didn't order big expensive dinners- a family seated behind us was clearly unhappy with how long it took to get their meals and how they were done.

After reading some of the less than favorable reviews, I was a little concerned. I will say some of the complaints were justified....as for others, well, some people just like to complain about everything. So here is our evaluation of the place (we've stayed at numerous family-oriented resorts throughout the US, so I feel we have a pretty good idea of what \"good\" vs \"bad\" is.) It's a little long, but I always like to get good info from these reviews. I hope you do to. Anyway here goes: The good points: We arrived late in the evening and we had a reservation for a 1 BD suite in the main building. We got this through Hilton points - so for us the price wasn't an issue. We are Hilton Honors Silver members so my husband asked if they could upgrade us to a casita at no charge and they did for all 3 nights. This was excellent, because I knew we would be cramped in the regular 1 BD suite. We were travelling with our 2 kids (2, 6) and my parents. The grounds of the resort are really nice and well-kept. They have the usual Southwest feel - stucco buildings, lots of cacti, also lots of green grass and trees. The water park, the River Ranch, was great fun for my son and husband. The Lazy River is one of the longest we've seen and the mini-golf is a really nice 18 hole course, winding throughout the pool complex and built into the rocks (these are real rocks surrounding the pool and golf - not the fake ones most resorts build). It was a little too chilly for my swimming preference - although the water was heated. The outside temp was about 72 each day. I did enjoy sitting in the sun and watching the kids swim, but didn't actually join in. The water park was definitely not crowded. We pretty much had the place to ourselves, along with maybe 2 or 3 other families. The casitas are set in clusters of buildings and each group also has its own pool and hot tub. I enjoyed taking a dip each evening in the pool (which was heated) and then relaxing in the hot tub. Another great plus: The bedding is exquisite. The beds are probably the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The linens are top quality and the towels and the robes they give you to use are great!! My husband said the fitness center was really nice. We opted for the value pack which was an additional $9 per day per suite. It included access to the fitness center, free mini-golf all day, and 2 for 1 ice cream in the ice cream shoppe. He said this was a top-notch fitness center - not just a few bikes and a weight machine. Plus, the individual price for mini-golf is $5/person. So, it's definitely worth it to get the package. The staff is exceptional. Everyone is very friendly and they all try to accomodate you. The not-so-good stuff: The rooms are definitely dated and in need of remodeling. For a top resort, a Hilton Category 5, they definitely don't measure up. The casitas are nice and roomy - they are bi-level, with a Bedroom with 2 queens and a bath upstairs. Downstairs is a small kitchenette, dining area and living room. There is also a large balcony off the upstairs bedroom. There is a lock-out to another bedroom and bath if you have the 2 Bd option. The carpeting, furnishings, appliances are just not at a luxury resort level. If I were paying the 200+/ night for the place, I would have been disappointed. Plus, even though there is a fridge and microwave, there is no dishwasher. The only dishware that is provided is paper plates and plastic silverware. I mean, even the most basic extended stay-type places provide real plates and silverware. They do provide real glasses and coffee cups, but we had to ask twice for extra coffee mugs, because they only have 2 per suite. The only restaurant (other than the pool snack bar) is expensive. We didn't eat there, because it just looked like too much for what they offered. We ate breakfast in the suite. Ate lunch and dinner at other places. We did try Aunt Chilada's, the Mexican restaurant that others raved about just down the street. We were not impressed. The service was slow, the food was just OK - not great Mexican. And we thought the prices were pretty high. $5.95 for the kid's meals (drink not included) $1.50 for a side of sour cream. $3.00 for a side of Guacamole etc... I would recommend Gallagher's just across the street from the hotel. It's basic American/Sports bar type food, but very good and reasonably priced and the service was great. Other than that, we didn't see alot of nice restaurants within walking distance. Overall we would probably go back when the weather is a little warmer. But only with Hilton points again.

When we saw all of the pictures on the hotel website of this hotel and its amenities, we were pretty excited. However, the pictures and the hotel itself do not live up to expectations. First of all, even though the pictures on the hotel website show this gorgeous view of the mountains from your room, this is hardly ever the case. Our room was actually on the ground floor, in an inside courtyard. There was a tiny patio, perhaps 2 feet wide in length (see picture) with a cement wall in front of it, so you could see nothing from your room but the cement wall. The rooms are all suites, which is nice, there is a sitting room, with a lumpy couch, a tv, and a coffee-maker (no tea, though) and the water from the taps are undrinkable. You can buy bottled water for $6.00 a bottle, or get water from water fountains all around the hotel, which is probably filtered and tastes a lot better. The bathroom is so small that the bathroom door grazes the toilet when you try to shut it. The sinks are in a separate alcove, with a nice shaving mirror, hair dryer supplied, nice Crabtree & Evelyn Toiletries, and two nice robes are supplied as well. The bedroom does have a comfortable bed, adequate closet and dresser space. Since our suite was on the ground floor, we had to keep the curtains in the sitting room closed all the time, since that room faced the courtyard. The bedroom was the room with the patio and brick wall. This also meant that we could never open any doors to get ventilation, since the screen on the patio door was broken. Housekeeping was adequate, no complaints there. The hotel states that there are many walking trails in the mountains nearby. That is true, but what they do not tell you is that in order to get to those walking/hiking trails, you need to actually drive there, it would be about a 3-4 mile walk. However, you are not permitted to park anywhere near the trails. You would have to park at the hotel and walk to the mountain trails. There was only one restaurant that was open, and that was The Hole In The Wall. The other restaurant, The Lantana Grill, was still closed for renovation. The food at The Hole In The Wall was not all that good, and it was expensive. We ate breakfast at the hotel twice because we did not know where else to go at first. If you smoke, you have to sit in the bar, or sit outside. Breakast was around $10.00 a person, and for that you would get eggs, breakfast meat, some nasty fried potatoes, biscuits and fried bread. We had dinner once in the restaurant, and once was enough. The fried rattlesnake was good to try, and you get a t-shirt for trying it, but that cost $38.00. I had the prime rib, which tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave. For around $23, it was not that great. There was nothing special about the food or the menu. The one night we ate dinner there, since we smoke we did sit in the bar to eat, and there was a couple there with four children. This was at 9:00 pm, the couple was quite inebriated, and the four children were screaming, obviously tired, and out of control. We honestly thought that the bartender should not have continued to serve the parents, but I just think she was hoping they would simply go away. It was not a pleasant meal. There is a nice fire pit on the patio outside the restaurant, and we went by several times on several evenings, hoping to be able to sit outside there and have a drink, but the fire pit was never lit. The property itself is lovely. There are many pools, and the one plus to our room location was that it was literally steps away from the pool and hot tubs. The hot tub was great, we used that every single night. The pool was chilly, but still coming from Delaware, where it had been 12 degrees when we left, we were thrilled to be able to be sitting in a pool outside anywhere in December. We took a stroll through the water park, which would be very nice if it had been slightly warmer. I think there are a lot of activities here for kids, but for adults there is not all that much to do. On the plus side, the concierge service is excellent. We had never been to Arizona before, and wanted an idea of some places to visit. The concierge gave us all sorts of brochures, detailed directions, and they were extremely friendly. However, Western Town is not open at this time, since they were moving the entire town to a reservation. We drove all the way there, only to find out it is still under construction. Parking can be a nightmare if there is any kind of function going on at the hotel, which seems to be often. On a Saturday evening there were at least three huge parties and the traffic was a nightmare, with cars driving all over the place, in the wrong lane, and not enough personnel to direct the cars anywhere. It was like New York City at rugh hour. It took almost 1/2 hour to get from the entrance of the hotel to a space reasonaly near our room. That was ridiculous. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere. Well, not in the middle of nowhere, but you have to drive to get anywhere. If you come for a conference with your spouse, and the spouse takes the car, you would be stuck at the hotel, as I was, with nowhere to go. If you think ok, you can sit in your room and look at the mountains, as I thought I would be able to do, forget it. You will sit looking at that brick wall. The hotel does offer a shuttle, however, to the two malls in Scottsdale for a cost of $10 and $15.00. The layout of the hotel is very confusing. The buildings are not marked, and so if you come in at night, as we did, we drove around forever trying to find our building. Lighting is poor. The hotel charges an additional $9.00 a day for use of facilities, such as the water park, miniature golf, etc., but they will remove this charge if you do not use those facilities. The entire staff is very friendly and accomodating, and does make you feel welcome. There is a gift shop in the hotel, with items you could find in a million other touristy gift shops, and the prices were about the same as everywhere else. If you want a decent breakfast for a lot less money and a lot more character, I would suggest driving to the 5& Diner, which is about a 10 minute drive away. The place is cool reproduction of a 1950's diner, the waitresses wear poodle skirts, the diner has the metal box-car look, juke box music inside, checkered floors, and the food is great. The prices are really good, half of what the prices are at the hotel. Don't miss the chicken fried steak platter for breakfast. A nice dinner alternative is about a block from the hotel, called Aunt Chilada's. Its' a Mexican restaurant, good food, great prices, good drinks, and you can sit in a beautiful outdoor heated patio, surrounded by fountains, birds and trees. It was a really pleasant adult experience. The hotel will give you a list of recommended restaurants within an hour's drive. We tried to get to one of the restaurants that was supposed to be a cowboy grill that seemed a lot of fun, but the directions on the sheet were wrong, they simply ended at the critical point, and after driving for over an hour in the horrible rush hour traffic, we never did find the restaurant. We ended up driving back to another restaurant recommended by the hotel, Don and Charlies, and that was also disappointing, as well as expensive. If you are planning on visiting any museums while on your vacation, take note that all museums are closed on Mondays. It would have been nice had we been told this when the conceriege gave us the directions to the museums, saving us a trip into downtown Phoenix. One thing to be aware of, when you get those directions, it states an approximate time of how long it will take you to get there. In almost every case, add at least one hour to that driving time. When we went to Sedona, definitely a place not to be missed, the directions stated it was about a 1 1/2 hour drive. It took us 3 hours, and my husband is a fast driver. When we went to visit The Apache Trail, another not-to-be-missed sight, but not for the fainthearted or anyone with a large car, the directions stated again about 1 1/2 hours, and it took us 2 hours to drive there. Arizona is a beautiful state, and we can't wait to go back again, but with all of the hotel options available, we would not stay here again.", "Date": "December 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silicon Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cA 3-Star Hilton, Not a 4-Star Resort\u201d", "Author": "Onmessage1", "ReviewID": "UR4228643", "Content": "This hotel has very nice rooms -- it's an all-suite property with excellent new beds.

ROOMS: We had a suite of sitting room with sofa sleeper and bedroom with 2 doubles. The first night we were in the south pointe block, very dated rooms with vanity at end of bed in main bedroom and only 4 small drawers for 5 peoples clothes for a week's stay!!!! The paint was flaking off the woodwork, the room smelled dirty even though it looked clean, and the bathroom was the most basic and I thought the smallest bathroom I have experienced in the USA. We had just spent all day driving so we just shut up and put up. Next morning we got transferred over to the north pointe block to an updated room on the ground floor which I had said was OK but the desk clerk failed to mention that there was a five foot screen blockwall enclosing our tiny patio because it adjoined the car park, the suite was tidier but the bathroom was even smaller than the first, a very short tub but slightly better shower head, thankfully the vanity had its own recess seperate to the bedroom and was pretty with granite countertop and nice fittings. You could only get out one side of the beds as I found out when I got up in the night and crashed into the wall and I am quite petite! There was more clothes storage though. Suites are better suited to a 4 people occupancy than 5, my teenage son was not amused that the maid had walked in 3 times by 8am, he was on the sofa sleeper and waiting to shower, he made sure he used the do not disturb sign after that. Registration told us that they were sorry we had been wrongly advised, we should have booked a casita. FOOD: We were advised to take out the bounceback breakfast package at an extra $20 + tax a night and that kids breakfast was free, our kids ages were on the confirmation slip so reservations knew 2 of them were over the age 12 cut off for kids meals. Bounceback breakfast only costs $8-50 at the table so it is cheaper to pay or charge it at the table on a daily basis than to purchase vouchers in advance, kids breakfast is not included but it is only $4, but our breakfast bill was an extra $15-$20 daily on top of what I had been quoted, we got another I'm sorry, you were misinformed. Also check your restaurant bill, ours was wrong 3 days out of 4 and the bounceback breakfast options varied depending on your server despite being written clearly on the menu- we opted to skip breakfast after that as we couldn't face any more meals there or any more 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' comments - the other restaurant was closed. The restrooms in the hole in the wall are labelled 'squatters' and 'standers' which I actually found offensive. RIVER RANCH: The nightly rate only covers 4 people per suite, extra kids are $10 daily, another 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' as I specifically asked if all resort fees were included for all 5 of us when I booked and was told - yes of course. River ranch has a lazy river (it is actually the river that is lazy, it is so slow you have to paddle yourself in order to move). There is 1 flume type slide, a toddlers pool, 2 swimming pools and a very hot spa, which I liked once they cleaned it out but I was the only one in it, others dipped toes, said ouch and walked away as it was so hot. My 5 year old was kept amused for about the same amount of time as in a regular hotel pool, my older kids were not particularly impressed and actually didn't bother swimming everyday, I had booked the hotel specifically to treat the kids to better pool facilities after they had seen the pool area on the website, they had been looking forward to staying there too. STAFF: Always friendly and courteous and very good at saying 'I am sorry you were misinformed'!! We pointed out our issues to the desk clerk when we checked out before our due departure date as the experience was ruining our vacation so much we checked into alternative accommodation, he refunded all unused bounceback vouchers and said 'Im sorry....... - you get the rest by now.", "Date": "November 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Chrella", "ReviewID": "UR4085759", "Content": "We loved this hotel, the rooms are beautiful & the staff were very friendly & efficient.

The \"suite\" was a nice change from having \"just a room\", and the extra television set was great for my daughter. The beds were comfortable and had nice linens and a down comforter (although not what you need in Phoenix in August!!) I felt the room was dark and needed some updating. I don't care for sinks outside the bathroom...and you guessed it...here the sink is outside the bathroom! Initially, when we checked in we were given a first floor South suite location. This room was not to our liking, since it was in a dark part of the building that seemed out of the way! We immediately went back to the desk and they offered us a room on the fourth floor. The room was better...however, the elevator to get to the room had no a.c. and the fan did not work!! We realized this was a problem after we had already unpacked! So for five days, my daughter and I ran up and down the stairs to get to the room while my husband decided to \"tuff it out\" in the elevator! (Note: I told my husband we should complain about the elevator, but he insisted that this is probably something they are well aware of! To be continued...at end of review) They appeared to be doing lots of updating around the premises (but not to the elevator!) The pool area for the \"South\" building was closed due to \"renovations\", however, during our stay, we never witnessed any renovation work going on there! The water park area was nice, and since we were there midweek, there were no crowds to contend with! The lazy river was soooo lazy that sometimes, we actually paddled our way through it! High marks for the cleanliness of the pool area (especially the bathrooms..kept nice and clean!). Ate several times at Hole in the Wall and was very pleased with the food. Had a great waitress the first time we ate there so we were sure to return. This waitress brought to our attention that \"kids eat free\" which we were unaware of! Nice bonus! However, upon our return visits, we were charged for our daughter's meal and had to remind our servers of this! The service got worse and worse with each return trip and we never saw that first waitress again! We ate at Aunt Chilada's and found it to be an excellent dining experience! (great chips!!) Also had breakfast at 5th and Diner and enjoyed it! Every time we wanted to eat away from the hotel, we needed to drive at least 10-15 mins. to do so. I would have liked a hotel that had places to eat and shop that were a bit closer or \"walkable\". Before I selected this hotel for our stay, I read many reviews and selected the Hilton based on the information I gathered. The \"kid-friendly\" factor was key to my selection of this hotel and our daughter did enjoy the water park facilities. I would have liked \"spiffier\" accommodations for my husband and I to feel a bit pampered, but I guess at the rate we got, it was what we paid for! Back to the elevator story....(I didn't forget!!) when we were checking out, I decided to mention to the desk person that the elevator in our part of the building had no a.c. or fan and that it caused lots of inconvenience for us. She said they were unaware of this and that no one else mentioned it!

We took off his life vest and he was able to slide down the slide by himself. One of us was waiting to catch him in the 3 foot deep water below. The slide is perfect for smaller children and adults that can't handle huge slides (like my husband!). The drinks by the pool were a little expensive but snacks and beverages were located right by the pool. The restrooms were very clean -even at the end of the day. We ate most days at the Hole in the Wall and never had a bad meal. The chili, ribs, salads and chicken were all very good and the portions were huge. The only bad meal we had was breakfast at the Lantanta grill. The service was terrible. I swear they had one waitress for the whole restruant. We got one cup of coffee and never saw the waitress again. We had to go search for the check and the people sitting next to us finally got their own water because nobody elso was around to do it. We loved our room. It was perfect for us. Our son who wakes up very early was able to go into the other room and watch T.V. while the rest of us slept in the bedroom. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. The only other complaint I have was about the railing outside of our room. There was a huge space on either side of the railing. It didn't look to be damaged-it just had huge gaps. The first thing my son did was to inform us that he could stick his head through the hole. My husband pulled him back in time. I did say something to a security personal -but of coure he told me that a child couldn't fit though the railing. I told him my whole body could fit through the hole when I turned sidways and I weigh 140lbs. I am mentioning this problem because though I loved this hotel, I don't want any child to fall. We really did like this hotel but when you stay there I am sure you will see the gaps in the railing for yourself and if you have small children will understand my being very nervous about this. If more people complain-I hope they will fix it. We are looking forward to staying here again. We also found the hotel personal to be very friendly and helpful. They were so nice in the giftshop.

The positives far outweighed the negatives. Checkin/Checkout - Easy and quick. A bit of pressure from the bellman to have them assist you with your luggage, but the gentlemen who ended up helping us was very nice and helpful. Room - We had a 2 bedroom casita in the back of the resort. The 2 level casita was spacious, clean, comfortable and well-equiped. 3 total TV's, all of good quality and size. High-speed internet is $10/day and worked well. There was a fullsize refrigerator in the casita and a microwave. The casitas are far from new, so there were certainly a reasonable amount of paint cracks, carpet stains, tile disclorations. Nothing that anyplace that age wouldn't have. The air conditioning worked great! Resort - The resort is large and very quiet, considering how many people were there. It is very well kept up, and the views of Squaw Peak are great. The pools did get a bit crowded, but we had no problem finding lounges. Towels were provided at all pool areas. Outside of the main \"water park\", the other pools were quite small, but plentiful. Kids loved the lazy river (it's a bit too lazy I think). A negative for me are that there did not seem to be a bar area that was open late. Also, there did not seem to be a game room or some central location for the kids to congregate. Restaurants - I had numerous meals and drinks at the pool bar. Service was friendly and quick and the prices were reasonable for a resort. If you start a tab there check your closeout bill carefully as I was charged for others orders. It was taken care of by the staff without any issue. I had breakfast one day in the Hole In the Wall and it was quite good and reasonably priced. Location - I mentioned the mountain view earlier and that is a big plus. There is a supermarket and Walgreen right down the street which we found handy. Highway 51 (North/South) is also right down the street and was used often. Fairly close to airport.

We \"arranged\" with a girl at the desk to provide a room key to our son who was arriving later in the day, and for whom we'd reserved an extra room. She smilingly assured us all would be taken care of. When we returned late in the afternoon, we discovered by phone that our son's room still was not ready and that he hadn't checked in. We suspected something amiss and so waited in line to talk with the smiling girl who'd promised everything would go so smoothly. She avoided talking to us - before our turn arrived, she signalled to a male desk clerk to take care of us, though at that point we'd given no signs of being upset. We simply wanted to know if our son had arrived. She obviously knew things had not proceeded according to plan and was afraid to face us. We were directed - rather escorted - to speak to a male desk clerk who was already bristling, though nothing had yet been said. My wife asked if our son had arrived and was told \"yes.\" \"Was he given a key to our room?\" \"No, because he hadn't a picture ID!\" \"But he has his passport - he just flew in from Montreal,\" my wife said. \"Lower your voice when you're speaking to me!\" the man replied, though I didn't note anything extraordinary in her tone. His escapist reply might have been comical, were it not so rude. \"But we arranged for him to be given a key...\" my wife continued, nearly whispering, and glancing to her side at the (formerly) smiling girl who was now leaving the reception area to escape any possibility of becoming involved. I was wondering what the man would say in regard to the passport - obviously our son could not fly in without an adequate picture ID. \"Don't point your hand at me!\" the man instead replied, though all my wife was doing was resting her right hand (she was holding our car keys) on the countertop, while her left hand was still holding her purse. That desk clerk could be termed a cretin, a loose cannon, an untrained or idiot \"Faulty Towers like\" clerk - whatever - but I have little inclination to ever return to that hotel just because of him and the \"smiling girl\" who apparently feared involvement because her colleague had probably intervened and refused my son a key. The Pointe's grounds at Squaw Peak are extensive. We searched for our son for nearly an hour before we found him - our paths between the Hole in the Wall and Dantano restaurants and the pool, convention center and room nearly crossed several times, till finally we called for the Nth time on one of the hotel phones and received word he'd \"checked in\" What a joke! It was after 4:00 p.m. We also received a message on our room phone to that effect. The following day, the idiot clerk graced with us a perky \"good morning\", etc., while the \"smiling girl\" avoided looking. I felt a strong inclination to answer his \"good morning\" with \"Don't raise your voice at me!\", but why escalate things with a moron. They've got a great water park - and maybe it justifies dealing with idiots. I'll leave that matter to other guests to balance out. Some items in our room were non-functional (e.g. high-speed Internet), but I could easily have overlooked them - in fact, one can overlook a lot of small deficiencies, if only the staff is civil.

They spared no expense on the beds. The beds were very comfortable with down blankets and pillows. My 9 year old daughter said that this wouldn't be a 3 star hotel if it wasn't for the beds. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was good food and average service. The first couple of meals were fine but one morning for breakfast we waited over 40 mins. And never saw our food or water again. We had to track him down in order to get our bill because my wife had meetings to attend. They did box up my food to take with me at no charge. They informed us that they were very busy that morning and apologized. The service by the pool was horrendous. There were very few people to take care of a very large area. We had an average wait time of about a half hour for a drink. At one point a server had noticed that a half dozen flags on our lounge chairs were up and he told us that our server was busy and he walked off and sat down next to a girl sun bathing and continued to talk to her while we waited. When our guy did show up there were so many orders to take it was another 20 mins before we received our drinks. Oh, and he forgot my two daughters' drinks... After that I decided to just go to the bar (Slim Picken's) myself. Only problem here is there isn't enough staff to service all of the servers and people at the bar and people that can't get served. While my wife was in meetings we were at the pool and the service continued like this for three days until my very hungry wife (day 3) who was never served breakfast met us by the pool for lunch. We figured a hotdog lunch and drinks but we only saw one server and because of this the line at the bar was about a 30 min wait. My wife had called to let the manager know that the pool was way under staffed and that if we can't get served and can't bring anything into the pool area, how were we going to eat? The manager sent us the director of the Slim Picken's and Hole in the Wall. This guy was very nice and apologetic and offered to get us a seat at the Hole in the Wall but we informed him that there was a chance we would get served because or our earlier experience at breakfast. This man not only personally served us lunch by the pool but he completely fixed the pool services problem. Six people showed up and all the lines went away. Servers were walking around asking if you wanted anything because everyone was taken care of. He also to our surprise took care of our dinner bill that night. We also ate at the Aunt Chiladas restaurant. Very good food and it could have been a coincident but we had an ok service the first night so we went back the next night and in took about two hours from time we sat down to the time we got our bill.

We were offered bellhop service but chose to find our room ourselves. We had requested that we be away from the 24 hour pools (less noisy) and on the top floor if possible. Both our requests were met. Our room was clean, spacious and even had a microwave! Our view was of the parking lot but was partially screened by a huge palm tree growing right outside our window. We were at the very end of the row of rooms closest to the side entrance into the complex.-good because there weren't people walking back and forth in front of our room... bad because the view wasn't great from either window! (Also the garbage truck came in the side entrance and you might be disturbed by the noise) We bought the BounceBack package which gave us food vouchers for breakfast every day at either of the two restaraunts on the property. A very good deal (We loved both of them) .Lantana had great Mexican shredded beef! Hole in the Wall was more fun being right outside by the pool. Suggestion to those who have read this far... get there early 'cause it fills up fast. We never ate the buffet because there were so many other tasty things on the menu. As for lunch, we broke the bank and ordered poolside, heh you only live once! The quesadillas were quite good! Dinner we went off property. Aunt Chilladas across the street was very good. Large servings of Mexican and reasonably priced. It is a hike from the far side of the property, so have the bellman drive you over in his cart! We went way out of town to a place that had sawdust on the floor and neckties hanging from the ceiling (this place was in one of our guide books, maybe Frommers) and it was a waste of money. Sorry I can't recall the name! The pool... lots of fun, even for my 12 and 13 year old boys. They enjoyed floating very slowly (it was very crowded and bottle necks occurred lots) down the lazy river and they also had fun in the larger pool as well. Another hint for those who are still reading... the lounge chairs can be very hard to get especially under an umbrella. Make sure to get up early and get down to the pool so that you can get a chair. I mean stand in line at the pool entrance before it opens , lots of others will be there already, I promise you!!! (Warning -Don't try to save a chair by sneaking in early thru the tennis courts - there are empoyees who watch for this tactic and will take your stuff away or send you back out on your way!!! First hand experience!) We had fun playing tennis; choosing early morning or evening court times to avoid the heat. Be sure to book reservations because they too fill up! Have fun.

We had a great rate for the 2 bedroom casita, with 2.5 baths and big deck, perfect for family with young kids. Avoid the \"Hole in the Wall\" restaurant for dinner, the \"kids eat free\" promotion doesn't make up for sub-par meals- the \"specialty\" barbecue items are to be avoided. Breakfast and lunch were better. Aunt Chiladas is decent and a quick walk. Come prepared- the casitas are perfect for keeping costs down by bringing in groceries and beverages from the store down the street. Bring your coffee press, coffee is apparently not a priority in Phoenix.

We stayed here for three nights in May 04, before touring Arizona. An early flight meant that we arrived at 11 am - though this wasn't a problem and we were immediately checked into our room. The suite with seperate living room was perfect for us and our 5 year old son. The view wasn't great, but with the lovely pool with swim-up bar & children's pool just downstairs, it really didn't matter. The waterpark is great fun and surprisingly relaxing. Our son was content to float around the lazy river for ages, whilst we relaxed doing the same. The waterpark was busy on the Sun, but very quiet on the Mon & Tue. The Lantana restaurant was the best place for food, though the Hole in the Wall was good for breakfast. Our only real complaint was that the kid's club was closed, as they apparently require 3 or more kids to open it. I guess this was because it was the start of the low season - it was still a disappointment as the hotel blurb led us to believe that it was open year round. If you are travelling from the UK, this hotel can be booked very cheaply through Trailfinders (we paid \u00a375 inc tax) - better than any other web deals.", "Date": "June 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norman, OK", "Title": "\u201cfine for family\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2179890", "Content": "...advertised as a suite, but terribly small.

We did have to wait on our room, but the hotel gladly held our luggage until the room was ready. The food in all of the restaraunts was wonderful and the drinks were happily served and worth the amount paid. We have absolutely no complaints and would highly recommend this resort.

We stay in a two bedroom casita which has its own pool. Never crowded! You can get up in the morning and take a dip all by yourself if you wish... or even in the afternoon! I have read the other reviews about the drink prices and food prices being expensive... I don't think their prices are any higher than any other resort. What do you expect ... This is a 4 star resort! It makes me wonder have they been staying at Holiday Inn's on their vacations or what?

The suite layout gives lots of room in both bedroom and living room areas, although the bathroom is accessible only through the bedroom, unlike some suite hotels. There is a very large wet bar area; strangely, no mini-refrigerator, microwave, or other kitchen type amenities are present, wasting what would be a positive addition. There is the ubiquitous refreshment center refrigerator, but it's packed with high-priced snacks and unable to hold any additional food. The decor is pleasant, somewhat dated, but clean and well kept. There are no views to speak of, other than parking areas or tree stocked inner courtyards. The restaurant is a short walk and adequate, although nothing special. I have not used the recreation areas, but the families I've spoken with rate that aspect highly. Staff is courteous and helpful. The location is fine for vacationers, a bit north of downtown and west of Scottsdale for other travelers. I happen to conduct business in the Squaw Peak area, so it is convenient and a better value than any other nearby hotels for business travel.

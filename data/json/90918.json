The main reason was my trip was mostly around the north side of Chicago and I didn't care to stay in the Loop/River North area so the choices narrow rather quickly. I only noticed around 4 floors of rooms (the elevator only went up to 4). The room I stayed in and most of the rooms are rather small. Not many outlets, a big comfy chair but nothing useful if you're trying to work (not many outlets either). Bathroom is a bit cramp, separate hot/cold faucets for the sink, light switch was hard to find (opposite wall of door). It's radiator heated, I was OK with it. The closet is rather large, might have used the space better. Flat panel TV against one of the walls. On this trip, I wasn't really concerned about working on my laptop or charging a lot of items so the power situation wasn't that big of a deal, but if I were to be on a work trip, I might be more annoyed with the lack of power. I had a Sprint 4G hotspot so I didn't need to use the hotels wireless (Sprint's service had a strong signal but I got around 3Mb down/1Mb up). There's a comp breakfast but I didn't get up early enough to take advantage. Running around the north side, I had no use for a rental car. They charge $15 a night for parking in the tiny lot on site with overflow at a nearby self park. It's easy to grab a taxi on the street at all hours and there's the 22 Clark, 36 Broadway, and 72 Diversey bus at the nearby intersection (with other bus routes and train stations nearby). A little boutiquey/quirky but if you need something further north of the Loop/River North, this place is one of the better located spots on the north side.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "brian j", "ReviewID": "UR123123250", "Content": "Great location...

I was really nervous about staying here because the reviews were so mixed. When we arrived we were relieved because the lobby is a lot nicer than the photos show. The parking was $15 but that was okay because it's expensive to park anywhere in Chicago. The staff were very friendly and quick. We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep. The breakfast was nothing special. The bagels were really hard but it was free so we didn't complain. The free wi-fi is very slow and won't work with any apps on a tablet/touch pad, just an internet browser because you have to \"log in\" every time you want to access something. It's not really worth using but will get the job done if you really need it. They also offer free coffee and hot tea in the lobby 24/7. We thought that was nice, especially because we were walking in the cold. Overall for the deal we got and the location it was not bad at all.

I threw it across the room. The shower was either freezing or scalding & just for fun it went from cold to hot on & off. Just sucked.

Once in our room, my husband reminded me we'd actually stayed in the same room some 10-12 years ago -- and I don't believe the management has changed a single thing in all that time. Other reviewers have complained about this hotel's distinct \"old building\" feel, while still other reviewers have praised it for that very reason. We are a family that very much appreciates the quirky charm of old buildings, and are happy to make allowances accordingly -- but that's not the same as saying we appreciate *unkempt* old buildings. We stayed in Room 417, a nonsmoking room that looked out over the small parking lot off Diversey Pkwy. (Alas, we were neither lucky nor early enough to score a space there, and instead had to put our car in the nearby Century Shopping Mall garage at the hotel's $12 overnight rate -- a good price, I grant you.) This room is indeed quirky: It features two double beds in a smallish space, flanked on both sides by two full (if quite compact) private bathrooms and closets. Personally, I was grateful no one had ever come around in the 1970s to swap out the lovely 1930s-era bath fixtures or tiles. Of course, \"new-construction-loving\" folks might very well wish for just the opposite. What we didn't particularly care for staying in this hotel was the overall sense that our room wasn't quite completely clean. Oh, the beds were made up nicely enough (even if the bedspreads were dingy-old), and the bathrooms actually appeared quite clean indeed. But the room itself had grimy windows. The window sills were a bit too dusty. The carpeting was a bit too much on the worn side. We had two windows, and only one had a pull-down blackout shade; the other required us to draw curtains that weren't especially opaque, and which let the evening streetlights and morning sun in more than we'd like. Also, the air conditioning is a window unit that is o-l-d, huffs out stale-smelling air, and doesn't cool all that well. I wondered more than once just how moldy the A/C filter might be... Overall, this is a hotel that's OK -- and only that -- for the time being, but it won't be for much longer unless the management takes the necessary steps to freshen up and clean up. Finally, we paid $179 (plus the reasonable parking fee) for a family of three, which included a continental breakfast that was sustaining enough, if spartan. That would have been a bargain in a hotel more toward the Mag Mile, but I didn't find the price especially great for a northside neighborhood hotel of declining standards.

Too bad so many don't \"get\" the charm of an older hotel. I'd much rather stay here than some generic place. It's an old building with lots of great details. The room was spacious, not fancy but with character. Great original tiling and glass brick in the bathroom. High ceilings, old transom over the door, old fashioned radiators, AC in window. Everything was very clean. The Inn is only a few blocks from the Brown Line to downtown. The neighborhood is very busy and safe, lots of shops and people walking around even late at night. The complimentary Continental breakfast is very generous. The front desk service is excellent and extremely accomodating. When we asked for a hair dryer, an iron, more shampoo, an extra towel... each time it arrived within 3 minutes. (But we never asked for something in the middle of the night, as I'm sure the bachelorette party below did.) To those who object to having an \"old\" TV or carpet... this matters how? Reception was good and the carpet was clean - but Hello, you should always wear slippers in a hotel! And to those who complained about cracked plaster... again, so what? Yes, if it were built in 2000 with wallboard it wouldn't be cracked.

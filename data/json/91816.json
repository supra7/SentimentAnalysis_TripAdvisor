The 4 Queens is the place we stay on Freemont which offers Friendly staff, older decor, but clean rooms, plus cheapest price at the time.

We walked into a room that was smoked-filled and walked straight-out & they upgraded us to a suite for free!! Oh, no matter where you stay ask for a mini-fridge it helps so you can got to Walgreen at corner of Freemont & stock -up on drinks& goodies. There are plenty of gifts/trinkets for $1 & dasani/sodas, too @ stores. Freemont Street was a good spot to take my son for his 1st time gambling (i.e. turned 21). Freemont offers $1 tables along Freemont Street & penny/nickel slots (i.e. 4 queens, Fitz, binions, golden nugget). You just have to ask employees or look for them. Cheap good quality food all-day-long on Freemont st. Lots of incentives if you pick-up hotel club cards (i.e. offer coupons for gambling & food). We never left Freemont. Money stretched far on Freemont compared to the strip (i.e. which can break-the-bank in a day or less if not careful). Four Queens was the best price hotel after New Year\u2019s.

If you are looking for a bargain hotel, in a great location away from the overpriced, overrated strip, then the Queens, in fabulous downtown Vegas, is the place to stay. We purchased our hotel/air package through Allegiant. I agree with other reviewers that the front desk staff needs some lessons in greeting folks. While they are efficient, they aren't particularly cheerful or welcoming. They are the first impression that guests receive of the hotel and you should feel like they are \"glad that you are here\". Our room was in the south tower. While the decor is a little shopworn, we found the room to be exceptionally clean. The amenities in the bathroom were bar soap, shampoo and lotion. Yes, there is a 4-cup coffee maker and coffee in the room. Not a great cup of coffee, but it does indeed provide that initial jolt of caffeine to start the day out right. We were pleased. I would suggest using bottled water and bring quality coffee from home to enhance your cup of joe! We always feel that leaving a couple of dollars a day for housekeeping is very appreciated by the staff. They thanked us when they saw us and once left a nice note of thanks. These folks work hard and I can burn a couple of dollars in slots in a matter of seconds, so do tip! Our bed was very comfortable, the sheets were clean and the pillows also comfortable. Wi-fi is available at a charge. We stayed on the 16th floor and, although we didn't mind, to get ice we had to go either up or down two floors. We never had to wait long for an elevator. We've always enjoyed the casino. In fact, it's my favorite place to play video poker! I've always come out either ahead or broke even. The cocktail waitresses come by often and are very friendly. Security saw a guy talking to me at one of the machines and approached to make sure everything was okay. I think he was a panhandler and he saw them coming, so he left. Kudos to security! We ate at the Magnolia Cafe a couple of times and on preceding stays. The food is quite good. Look for their specials requiring your player's card. Some good values are there. My husband had a ham steak breakfast for $6.99. It was a huge ham steak, bread, hash browns and eggs; and hubby said it was wonderful! If you go during prime meal times, expect a longer wait to be seated. If you want super-fancy accommodations, stay at the Nugget, but if you want a reasonable place to stay at a great value, stay at the Four Queens.

One guy at the craps table was doing well throwing the dice and they kept harassing him regarding not throwing the dice hard enough. Of course if he was losing they wouldn't have said a word. Once he started throwing the dice hard enough they raised the table minimum from $5 to $10 in an effort to recoup the house losses. When that happened I walked away. Pretty uncool behavior by the table staff. Magnolias coffee shop is good. Sports book is small but staff is nice. I've heard good things about \"Hugo's Cellar\" so if you want a quality meal, give it a try.

Stayed in room 1408 North. They have 2 towers (north and south). The north tower is closer to Fremont Street and can be a little noisy until 1 a.m. The south tower faces the Strip. Although checkin is not until 3 p.m., they happily checked myself and my buddy in at 12:15 p.m. Took all of 90 seconds. Very fast and the young lady clearly knew how to do her job. The bell service was terrific. Had to rent a scooter the second night due to an ankle injury (yes the first night was like the movie the Hangover) and Steve at the bell desk was a great help. Here is a quick breakdown of the hotel/casino: Room: Small (though all rooms are kind of small on Fremont St.) but very clean. Housekeeping was very professional while I was there. Great view of Fremont Street and the mountains from my room. New HDTV with 34 free channels and pay per view movies. Bathroom was clean and stocked with plenty of towels and pretty good size. Casino: Yes, it looks like 80's. All of the lights and gold scream of a different time, but the video poker is terrific and $5 blackjack tables everywhere. Small sports book has all the games to bet on. From what i heard from other players around me, getting comped at the Four Queens is easier than at other Las Vegas casinos. Food: Chicago Brewing Company! Good food but as a beer lover myself, their housemade crafts are excellent. Ate breakfast at Magnolia's in the casino. HUGE breakfast burrito that was very good. Service in both was very speedy and polite. Overall, if you are in your 20's looking for a hotspot, the Four Queens is probably not for you (try the Plaza down the street).

Well, this hotel is everything but clean. The walls, the carpets, everything in the rooms needs a good make-over, or at least a good scrub.

Great customer service. On top of this, the clientele of the hotel is a little...dubious. I am not a great fan of casinos, but the atmosphere is by far nicer on the strip.

Downtown Vegas is an acquired taste and will not suit folks who have particularly high expections for room size, location, etc. Having said that obviously I am not one of those folks. I've stayed at many hotels on the strip and I've had my fill of them. I love downtown and I've stayed at several downtown hotels and finally settled on the 4 Queens as my favorite. It's an older property, it's not fancy, it has no glitz or glamour and I absolutely love it there. The rooms are a decent size and are cleaned pretty well. The beds are comfortable and the sheets won't scratch you to death. The bathroom is tiny but unless you are a huge person the facilities are adequate. The 4Q was one of the only places that had a coffee maker in the room which was a touch I always appreciated. But be advised that on my August trip they had removed the 4 cup coffee maker and replaced it with a Keurig pod machine with a note saying that for a fee you could purchase k-cups in their gift shop. Holy Crow! If I have to go to the lobby to buy coffee I may as well go to McDonalds and get my coffee, which is what I did. For my upcoming trip I'm taking my k-cups with me and all should be well. There are plenty of dining options in the area so you should be able to find something to suit your tastes. Some folks complain of the \"seedy\" area but I don't think it's all that bad. I've encountered much worse on the strip. I usually travel alone and I feel perfectly comfortable walking around the area by myself, although I will admit I will not venture to the El Cortez after dark; I'd suggest you save your long walks for daytime hours. I've never encountered problems during check in or during my stay. The majority of the staff at the 4Q have been very friendly and professional. I've never been disappointed at check in as they have always accommodated my request for a room away from the elevator and the Fremont light show. A final bit of advise---if you're traveling to downtown from the airport book a limo and save yourself the aggravation of dealing with the cabbies. I always use Bell Trans and they are always waiting for me when I arrive in the airport and departing from the hotel. They have never been late; not once. I had more than one negative experience with Vegas cab drivers and have never used their services since.

The mattresses seemed to be quite new and were excellent (fairly firm with a \"pillow top\"). The carpet also appeared to be newer, as were the bathroom fixtures. Everything was very clean. Linens, towels and toiletries were good quality. The heating and air conditioning are internal (not through the wall) and have an easily adjusted thermostat and fan speeds. The system was relatively quiet, providing good \"white noise\" at night. Unlike most casinos, the window actually opened (about a foot), providing fresh air when wanted. The room also had a coffee maker (a rarity in LV) and a flat screen TV. Rooms around us were occupied, but we heard very little noise from them. It was a non-smoking room, and other than a fairly strong cleaning solution odor when we first arrived (which cleared up quickly once we opened the window), the room was odor-free. We've consistently found the staff to be friendly and helpful (yes, there's the occasional grump, but it's the exception). For instance, the first room we were given backed up to the elevators and smelled somewhat smokey. We returned to the front desk and asked if she could make a change. She said it was not a problem and gave us another room (the one described above). She said if we didn't like that one we should come see her again, adding \"I'm here til midnight\". We also spend a lot of time gambling at the Four Queens. They do very well with their slot machine and video poker choices (some good video poker pay tables). Table games are a little less consistent. For instance, there is typically only one 3:2 $5 blackjack table during the day. Others are 6:5. Funny thing is, I've seen full 6:5 tables while the 3:2 table had empty seats, so I guess if I were the casino I wouldn't change things either. There is no poker room, nor is there a sports book (well, there is, but only enough to say they have one). The Four Queens seems pretty generous with comps compared to most other downtown or strip casinos (we belong to a number of player's clubs). Cocktail service on the floor is usually very good if you're gambling. The servers are always friendly, and frequent if you tip them decently. The Four Queens is not a large property. It's really nice if you're playing there and need to go back to your room for something to be able to do it in five or ten minutes, unlike the mega casinos on the strip. If you want a pool, you have to go to the rooftop of Binion's. That's a pain, but it's actually a cool setup. The view is amazing, and though the pool is small, the deck area is very nice and often almost deserted. If you like downtown (we became converts a few years ago, and rarely stay on the strip any more), and if you don't care too much about \"fancy,\" you'll probably find the Four Queens to be a good choice . I don't find much difference between the rooms we've had at the Four Queens and the Carson Tower rooms at the Golden Nugget, though of course the Golden Nugget is a larger and fancier property overall.

The upgrade cost an additional $68 per night which was still a bargain considering how cheaply we got the standard room. When booking our upgraded room; we were assisted by an outstanding reservations agent named Alba. Extremely helpful and went out of her way to provide great customer service and answer all of our questions. We had an early arrival at the hotel, getting there right around noon. The front desk clerk processed our reservation with no trouble and was very friendly but did tell us that our room was not ready and to come back at 1:30 to get our room key. We would be able to leave our luggage in the room then, although we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be cleaned and ready for our use until 4:00 pm (the hotel\u2019s listed check-in time) We left our luggage with the bellman and returned at 1:30 to get our key as instructed. Upon our arrival at our North Tower room (after a long and confusing hike from the desk to the room elevators), we saw that it was not yet cleaned from the last guests so we deposited our luggage and left again, returning at 4:30 pm to find that it was STILL not cleaned. Since it was then past the \u201cofficial\u201d check-in time, we went back to the front desk and consulted with the desk clerk who informed us after a call to housekeeping that the room would not be ready for at least a half hour to 45 minutes. After about 15 minutes of waiting in the casino; the front desk called and offered us the use of a standard room that we could use to get ready until our suite was finished by housekeeping. We accepted since we had dinner reservations in less than an hour that we needed to make ourselves presentable for. Given the inconvenience we had already suffered it wasn\u2019t such a great way to begin our stay. However; upon returning to the hotel four hours later, we FINALLY had our suite cleaned, ready and waiting for us. The suite itself was definitely older but then again, so is the hotel so no bones to pick there. Everything was clean and fresh with plenty of linens. The suite was actually two rooms; a bedroom and then a small sitting area with a loveseat, chairs and the sunken Jacuzzi. The bathroom was rather small for a suite but still clean and perfectly functional. (An aside: the standard room that we were forced to make use of for a brief period was definitely smaller all around, including an even smaller bath. That being said, it was still clean and well-maintained.) After the not-so-great beginning, we had no further issues till the end of our stay when we had returned to our room around 4 pm to that it had not been made up by housekeeping. When I called housekeeping to inquire, I was quite rudely told that they had received a \u201cno service\u201d call from our room that day. I assured them that we had made no such call & would like the room to be made up as soon as possible and was told that they would be there within the hour to do so. However, when we arrived back in our room around midnight, the room was still not made up. Another phone call to housekeeping, another assurance that someone would be \u201cright there\u201d. After twenty minutes, housekeeping called our room to tell us that they were in the middle of a shift change and it would be awhile before someone could get there. At 1 am in the morning, we heard a knock at the door. When we opened it, we found a pile of sheets and towels left there. No housekeeper, just linens. Wow. Overview: the hotel is older but seems to be in relatively good condition. It is extremely inexpensive and it's possible to get rooms for as little as $25 a night. Even if you get an upgraded room or suite, it\u2019s still relatively inexpensive especially compared to those hotels on the Strip. The rooms are all clean and have been updated with flat-screen televisions. The hotel has several dining options including an inexpensive 24 hour cafe (Magnolias). We ate there for lunch one time and it was average food quality with very slow waitresses. The casino is fairly large for a down-town hotel but is very poorly laid-out, making it very confusing to learn your way around. We were there for several days before we got our sense of direction and even after that, we had to pay attention to signs and \u201clandmarks\u201d in the casino to find our way to the correct elevator to our room in the North Tower. The slot machines seemed about on-par with other hotels on Fremont as far as payouts although we preferred going to other casinos to do our gambling because we just didn\u2019t care for the casino layout. Also be prepared for cigarette smoke! It\u2019s definitely an issue with all of the older casinos although Four Queens seemed to have a fairly good ventilation system in place. The parking garage is huge and free for guests staying at the hotel; all you have to do is show them your room key when exiting. Most of the employees that we encountered semed to enjoy their jobs and were friendly and helpful; although I will say that housekeeping didn\u2019t really impress us much! All in all, it was just a pretty average hotel.

The bad lamp and clock were plugged into a household extension cord which was (apparently) plugged to a broken outlet located beneath an immovable bed pedestal. The king bed was made up with stained queen sheets and a sticky bedspread. The walls were badly scuffed all around the bed, and there had clearly been no attempts at repair the damage. The bathroom was also a deluxe mess. The countertop was newly redone but not clean, the floor was dirty, the visibly dirty tub had been ineffectually disguised by an equally dirty vinyl mat, the showerhead dripped, and a dirty wash cloth was hanging from the shower curtain bar. The room was not even supplied with a bath mat. The whole carpet was damp underfoot and the air was so heavily scented with deodorizer I was worried about mold.

When he complained at the desk, he was told the fans could not be removed because 'engineering' was not in the building. Since his room was uninhabitable, he was assigned a different room and then informed that he would have to present himself at the front desk the next day between noon and 1PM to switch rooms yet again. After a late dinner and some temper-wrestling, further enquiries were made. It was revealed that he did not -have- to change rooms, but because his new room was in a different section, it was not considered deluxe -- but -- he could not be refunded the difference in price if he stayed there. No explanation was ever given for why this option hadn't been mentioned earlier, nor for why the hotel refused a refund for their error. Simliar communication troubles had started at check-in. We rolled into town at 8 pm after a day of hiking and driving; all ready for hot showers, cold drinks and clean beds. We had been assured by phone a week before arrival that it would be no problem to get our reserved deluxe rooms near each other and that free wifi would be available, but at check-in it turned out that rooms with king beds meant 3 rooms on 3 different floors and the wifi was $9 a day. Then came the scary news that online reservations were being dropped/lost and the staff were not even certain ours were in the system. We might have been better off if they'd lost our info. The desk staff tried to be helpful when I informed them of the broken outlet, but their only suggestion -- to attempt repairs during our stay -- was absurd, given that we had ample cause to doubt the maintenance staff's competence already. Avoid this hotel if you can. The low price and the fun of being near Fremont St, if it can be deemed fun when the show goes on until 2AM and the hotel has inferior soundproofing, does not come close to making up for the rest.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poteau, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you get a great price\u201d", "Author": "brbarnes", "ReviewID": "UR115630523", "Content": "They had a $25 per night when we stayed.

After reading some of the reviews I was anxious about my stay, but decided to give the Four Queens and the Freemont Street Experience a chance. Let me say the Four Queens is not the Venetian/Palazzo, or the Bellagio, or Caesar's Palace nor did I pay the rates the high end strip resorts demand. I was greeted by Jennifer (i think) at the reception desk and did the $20 trick asking her simply for a comfortable quiet room where I can rest when I am tired. I had read reviews saying the noise on Freemont Street can be bothersome in the evening. Jennifer gave me room 1042 in the south tower and the $20 back telling me \"I don't need a tip to give you a quiet, comfortable room.\" I was surprised at this level of professionalism and courteously which I have never seen on the strip. Had Jennifer kept the $20 I would have considered the money well spent as the room was wonderful. Room 1042 in the south tower is easily large enough for me with a pillow top king size bed. The room was clean and in good condition with a good view out the window. The bathroom is small, but it is clean and in good condition with good water pressure. The entertainment on Freemont Street was great from the three stages with the bands to the Sax player and the various interesting people to watch. The gambling in the casinos is good with lower minimums on the table games than on the strip often with dealers who were often very pleasant and helpful.

We didn't know what to expect, but had paid $20 a night (sale price) so were a bit apprehensive about the quality of the rooms etc. The Four Queens is located in the oldest part of Las Vegas on the corner of the famous \"Fremont Street experience\", which has the largest video display in the world (really quite something and worth a look). THE AREA: Fremont street, is a bit of a way off the strip and slightly less convenient, but worth it for the cheaper prices. There are still plenty of casinos and bars but fewer places to eat. THE HOTEL: The Four Queens has the grandeur of the old style hotels, while still feeling fairly modern. It has it's own casino downstairs and two restaurants. The food is OK but it's on the same level as TGI Fridays or Frankie and Benny's. We were a bit disappointed as the restaurant itself looks a bit more upmarket than that. There is a gift shop that's not too expensive and parking is ample. Room service is available. There isn't a pool but you can use the pool at the Four Queen's sister hotel across the road. This is on the rooftop and there are amazing views of Las Vegas. THE ROOM: I was really pleased with our room which was huge, with glass and gold rim furnishings. We had a flat screen TV and a very nice bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean and had a daily maid service. We could access WIFI from our room but it was very expensive (apparently this is the same in most Vegas hotels). Overall, if you can get a sale price on a room (I hear these are quite frequent), then you really can get a Vegas bargain here.

My sister had never really experienced Fremont Street so I was excited & a little anxious about her reactions. What a great trip! The 4 Queens, while undeniably old, was welcoming, clean and comfortable. We were in the South Tower, away from Fremont Street. The room was just fine for a quick Vegas trip. The bathroom was a little small when the two of us were in there getting ready in the morning, but, hey, this is not the Strip. Beds were extremely comfortable -no bugs. The few times we dealt with the front desk personnel, they were both friendly and helpful. We took advantage of the coupon book and ate at Magnolias (breakfast & soup & sandwiches were delicious) and Binions (burgers & fries very good). We are not fancy eaters so bargain dining was right up our alley. We took the free shuttle from The Fremont to Sams Town for a great time & ended up on the Strip. We spent half our time on the Strip seeing those hotels we wanted to see, but always enjoyed heading back down to Fremont Street. The intimacy down there allowed us to go our separate ways at times and meet without having to walk blocks & waste time. The entertainment was great (spray paint artists were amazing). We visited each of the downtown casinos and, although, The Plaza was a sad sight, you can see how elegant they were \"back in the day\". A \"must see\" is Mermaids. What a ball we had there. Coins still come out of slots and hands get dirty-just like the good old days. Best attention we got for drinks (waited 30 minutes for 2 Diet Cokes at Palazzo). A definite good time & Mardi Gras beads for all. The slots were just as tight downtown as on the Strip so no winning trip for me but had the best time. My sister is now a great Fremont Street fan.

I only paid $36 a night, so I knew it wasn't going to be anything like the Bellagio. Location: Old Vegas. On Fremont Street. The location is fantastic. We rented a car. The Four Queens is one of the only hotels in Las Vegas that charge a parking fee. That's good if you are staying at the hotel, because then there is always a parking spot. As a guest at the hotel, you get a VIP pass, so parking is free. The hotel is situated under the VivaVision Canopy of Fremont Street, and it is so wonderful to take an elevator down to the lobby, walk out through the casino and onto Fremont Street. Staff: Fantastic. Always smiling, very professional. If you even looked over at the Bell Desk, the staff would smile and ask if you needed anything. And if you had any questions or needed anything, you were helped right away. Check-in was a breeze. Rooms: Horrible. When we checked in, we asked the lady for a room with the best view. She was super nice but said that we could have a King Suite overlooking Fremont Street, but we would not be able to control the temperature and it's FREEZING. Also, Fremont side: you hear music 24 hours a day. Or we could have a room that overlooks the strip, but it's 2 double beds and we could control the temperature and it's very quiet. She was very apologetic. We chose the 2 double bed room with Strip view. We asked for the highest non-smoking room. The 12th floor is the highest non-smoking room and we got it. All floors above the 12th floor are smoking. Before we set out bags down, we checked for bedbugs. There weren't any. We had a great view of The Stratosphere and the Strip. The toiletries you get are 2 single packs of coffee (there's a coffee maker), shampoo, lotion and 1 small bar of soap. But....it smelled like smoke. Remember, we were sitting right under a smoking floor. Although the main area of the room was clean, the bathroom had mildew on the walls, the bathroom needed to be swept, and the bathroom itself was extremely small. The shower backs up, so after a minute of being in the shower, you're standing in ankle-deep water. The best way to describe the room was that it was worth the $36. We were able to accept it until we ate at the Wynn Buffet and saw how unbelievably beautiful that hotel was. After seeing that, it was hard to go back to our $36 room. If you are a smoker, and you don't mind dirt (we're very clean and somewhat germaphobic), then I recommend this place.

Previously we've stayed either on the strip or at the Golden Nugget. The Four Queens sent us a very good room offer so we took them up on it and were very pleasantly surprised. The room (two queens) had very comfortable mattresses, a flat-screen TV, coffee maker, and excellent water pressure in the shower. When we reported that the toilet was filling very slowly maintenance came and fixed it within an hour. They gave us a coupon book at check in that included a number of two-for-one offers on meals and drinks. Magnolias is a decent coffee shop/restaurant that was fine for our breakfasts and dinner one night. Likes - very friendly and accommodating staff, good gambling odds at the tables and video poker (3/2 blackjack and full-pay video poker machines can be found), the best cocktail service I've ever encountered on a casino floor (the servers are friendly and frequent, drinks are free if you're gambling), reasonable prices at Magnolias, rooms are a great value (I'd liken ours to something like a Hampton Inn in terms of size, content and layout). Dislikes - no pool on site, but you get to use the one on the rooftop at Binion's. That actually ended up being pretty cool. Great 360 degree views, very nice pool-side furniture, and for awhile we had it all to ourselves . It's small but serviceable and has a deep end (you don't find those in newer pools). Overall we were very happy with our stay and experience at the Four Queens. Closing thoughts - downtown is not for the night-club, people-watching, trend-setting sort. It's relaxed, things are close together, and the patrons are typically regular folks tending toward middle-aged or more. Since that's what we are, we're very happy there. After years of fighting the strip crowds, dodging the porno card handouts, and seeing the gaming odds deteriorate we decided to try downtown a couple of years ago. We see little reason to go back to the strip. Downtown is cleaner, friendlier, cheaper and thanks to the Fremont Street Experience has a constant schedule of events and stage bands.

Rooms were pretty old fashioned but did not other me at all. It was clean, had a bathroom, tv, safe, dresser, basically all I was looking for for a business trip. I had no problem with hot water, water pressure, toilet not working or housekeeping cleaning the room as I had read in previous reviews. Casino: It is what it is, an older looking casino in old Vegas. Nothing spectacular but for me the social gambler it was just fine. I would have like to see them offer a $2 Blackjack table as I had to go next door to Fitzgeralds for that. Other than that, like I said, it is what it is. Food: The Chicago Brewing Company had great food, good cigars, great beer. I spent most of my nights in there as I enjoy watching sports. Service was sometime very slow. I got looked at a few times with an empty glass in front of me and the bartender turned and walked away. Did not eat at the buffet. Noise: Yes if you face the Fremont Street Experience and are a light sleeper you will be kept awake by the music, however, the music was good. I enjoyed falling asleep to it. I was on the 12th floor facing it. My travel companion was on the 8th floor, not facing it, could not hear a thing. So yes, if you want quiet, request a room not faing the Fremont Street. As for Fremont Street, I went out there every night, it was fun, entertaining, relatively inexpensive, and I felt very safe. All in all I would say this hotel was worth the $30 a night I paid for it.

We easily walked from the Plaza at one end to Fitz on the other in 15 min. Everything's in a 4-5 block radius. Expectations: Expect to stay in older accommodations that are comparable to low-end strip hotels. Room: 949, the tower further away from the Fremont experience Pros: Friendly staff, maid service excellent, low table minimums, fast check-in, free in-room safe, in-room coffee maker, acceptable bed and pillows (they weren't great but they didn't prevent your from sleeping). Cons: Slow elevator, tiny room and bathroom (you can't sit on the toilet and close the bathroom door at the same time), extremely smokey casino (I know they all are, but this was particularly bad), horrible plumbing (the shower felt like a midget peeing on you and the you had to hold the toilet handle for 10 seconds to flush it then listen to it run for 5 solid minutes). Side note: Fremont experience could be a con for some people if they go to bed before midnight. No matter where you stay you can hear the nightly shows in your room. Last show was at midnight (I believe). Bottom line: I'm not really particular about where we stay and have stayed at multiple hotels in Vegas, but wouldn't stay at the 4 queens again. It's not horrible and you'll be fine staying here, but for $20 more a night you could stay at the Golden Nugget, or you could stay for cheaper in the remodeled rooms in the Fremont hotel. The 4-Queens isn't expensive by any means but they aren't priced to the quality of their rooms when compared to other options in the same area. From my location they are the 2nd most expensive hotel on Fremont street. If your a person who really likes to enjoy there room or spends a lot of time relaxing in your room do not stay here.

We had reservations at Binion\u2019s Horseshoe Hotel but they abruptly closed their doors in Dec leaving us with out a hotel for the Las Vegas NASCAR races. When we called we were told our reservations would be transferred to the Four Queens which I believe is affiliated with Binion\u2019s. The Four Queens staff did a great job transferring our reservations and changing the credit card deposit and assuring me that I did in fact have a room for 4 days. This turned out to be a good thing because the Four Queens is a much nicer hotel. The rooms have been updated. We stayed in the North Tower in a No Smoking double. Previous posters mentioned the noise from the Fremont Street Experience but we were on the other side of the tower and never heard a thing. The beds are firm which wasn\u2019t a problem for me but my 24yr old son said he had trouble sleeping. The room has an iron, ironing board and coffee maker. We had trouble finding the safe because it is in the bottom of the night stand. The previous guest left it locked so we called and they sent up someone right away to open it. I did not have my Lap Top but the safe appears large enough to fit my 17\u201d. The TV is a good quality 32\u201d flat screen. The channel selection is on par with most Vegas hotels. There is no HBO or other movie channels. We ate at their Chicago Brew Restaurant. We had pizza and hot wings which everyone liked. We have eaten at their steak house Hugo\u2019s Cellar before but I only recommend it for a romantic meal for two. Now for the bad, The Parking. Previous posters have mentioned having to pay $13+ for parking. This is only if you are not a guest. Make sure you get a VIP Parking pass when you register. I was not happy with the Valet service. The drop off and pickup are on opposite ends of the lobby. We stayed for 4 nights and we always had to wait a long time for an attendant to show up to take ours keys, at least 10 mins once. Valet pickup was not a problem except for our last day. I went to the Valet pickup area and there was a sign telling me to go back across the lobby to the drop off area to find an attendant. I did and again there was no one to be found. I had to go to the registration desk and they were able to help me.

The only complaint i have is that they should just stick with febreeze or something similar to get rid of the smoke smell in the lobby.

Complaints: - I wanted to order a meal \"to go\", so I went to Magnolia's Veranda. I waited outside for five minutes, and no host appeared, so I left; they need a \"no hostess counter\" or some way to avoid the rigmarole of waiting for a \"seating hostess\" so you can order a meal to go. BTW, I went across the street to the Binion's Snack Bar, and got a quick tasty meal to go at a good price. - If you cash in your comps points daily, be aware that the cash you receive is deducted from your card's points total. It might be better to let the points \"ride\", and accumulate for better comps in future.

We have stayed here before because we enjoy Fremont St. and Downtown Vegas in general. Last time we were here, they told us we could request the South tower for a quieter room. We did request this, but were told by a rather rude desk clerk named (I believe) Kathy that there were no non-smoking rooms available in the south tower. Really? Fremont St. was emptier than I've ever seen, but somehow ( in January, in the middle of the week, no less) the 4Queens sold out all of the non-smoking rooms in a whole tower? So we toted our luggage through the casino to the elevator, and not only are we close to Fremont St., We are on it! The window to our room was literally on the edge of the Viva Vision screen! Having stayed on Fremont St. several times before, we knew that the last show was at midnight. We thought no big deal, we rarely get to bed before midnight anyway. We also thought it might be cool to see the light show from a different perspective. Wrong on both counts! First of all, the shows end at midnight but the music plays 24 hours a day and the speaker was right underneath our window. Second, you really can't see very much of the light show being that close to it. Next, we are in a non-smoking room but the people in the room beside us must have smoked like chimneys. The door in the corner that would open for adjoining rooms was pouring smoke into our room. It was bad enough that it woke me up thinking the room was on fire. I took a damp towel and shoved it in the crack at the bottom of the door to impede the flow somewhat. The one good thing about the room was the shower. Great water pressure, and plenty of hot water to rinse off the grime collected from the rest of the Hotel. Cocktail service in the Casino was also lacking, So we went across the street to the Golden Nugget and gambled there. The saving grace to our trip was we had 2 nights comped at the Orleans hotel. We moved there for the rest our trip, and had a wonderful experience. A review for that will be coming shortly. P.S.

I said that I would not sleep on the ninth floor again. Second night sleep, slept with a long sleeve shirt and long pants. Woke up and found that I was bitten 4 more times. Just could not believe this, so I just let it go. Third night sleeping and got bitten another 2 more bites and they were very bad bites. Now I know why both Binion's and Four Queens Hotel Casino; owned by TLC Casino Enterprises Inc., needs to be closed down and both building demolished. Got home with some lose of vision.

They were friendly, but direct and to the point at check-in. We were given a South tower room, 6th floor. We were right under the fremont street experience canopy. If we would have been put on the 7th floor or higher we would have been looking at the outside top of the canopy. We were able to lay on the bed at night, leave the curtains open and watch the fremont shows. It was kind of cool! The elevathor is just a couple of steps inside the casino, as you walk in off of fremont street. Very convenient. The room was average and dated, but clean and everything worked. There was a small 4 cup coffee pot, hair dryer and the usual soaps, shampoo, etc. Water pressure was awesome! As a matter of fact it was almost to strong. The safe was in the bottom of the night stand. A little hard to get to, but hey...it's a safe! I was happy we even had one. We did not eat there this time, but we did visit the bar and found the drinks and service to be fine. Free cocktail service while gambling was no problem. Plenty of staff and opportunities for drinks. The drinks were weak, but I wasn't going to complain. We only played Video Poker here and the machines treated us well! Played 9/6 JOB and I believe 8/5 Bonus Poker. 25 cent denomination at the East end of the table games. Security was everywhere! Although, I do believe that the extra staff and security was probably due to the rodeo and all of the cowboys in the place. Everyone was well behaved, having a good time! I would recommend this place to anyone who is fine with clean, comfortable but not fancy. Best I remember the North tower might haave been a little newer, but not 100% sure.

The first show was Bad to the Bone, next was American Pie, then Queen, We will Rock you and it ended with Kiss I left since I was not that familiar with Kiss to stay. I know This ages me but I earned my age and the first three satified my entertainment for that night. I was not able to do very well in the casino and I thought it was too crowded but I won on the slots at the Wynn. Everyone seems to give you a free $10.00 to start with for signing up and the Deuces Wild was fun for almost 3 hours. I even won $60.00. From the strip the bus is $3.00 one way and when I come back I am going to get a bus pass (good for 24 hours) and get on the bus the very first day. On my way back everybody was going to the Fremont light show which is across the mall walkway from the Four Queens. Good luck and have a good trip with an extension cord and talking to the front desk until you find a room that smells good. Oh I almost forgot they do offer to send someone to spray the room but that only is topical since the cigarette smoke is embedded into the room. You would probably have to have it sprayed at least every day. Oh and I didn't know that you had to pay for the wi-fi internet. I had made sure that it was available but no one mentioned the cost. Also the pool is not on the premises you have access to one across the street. But all of this won't keep me from visiting again.

It is obviously an old building, but everything was in good repair. We had a 17th floor view in the north tower. We did not hear much noise from the canopy below from up there. The shows and free conncerts were great. The casino was of a reasonable size and had a good variety of slots and table games. Drink service was slow at first, but picked up once I kept tipping and made a point of searching out my cocktail waitress and telling her she was a bit hard to track down. She said they had been so slow all summer and then all of a sudden there was so much business they couldn't keep up. I believed her.

Our stay got off to a bit of a rough start as I had never been to this hotel / casino before and had difficulty finding the valet parking due to all the construction. The Valet parking is actually on a side street (2nd street I think) which ends behind the bandshell which is between the four queens and the fitz. I entered through the wrong street and ended up going into the wrong way into valet exit through the parking garage entrance - poorly marked but eventually I got things straigthened out with the slightly annoyed valet staff. (The valet here was difficult at the best of time - seemed to be understaffed or not anyone around with the separate valet drop off and pickup areas) Parking at the 4 Queens is $3 per night - but if you have a players card (which I had and anyone can get for free - the remove it from your bill). Once I had the in / out procedure down few problems (other then lack of staff with parking my rental car). The check in was a breeze - less then 2 minutes, polite efficient check in staff. We came in late and the casino was busy - again we had not stayed here before so found trip to eleveator the first time (across the casino) a little confusing. We had a nice room on the17th floor with a view towards stratosphere and strip. Our friends had a room overlooking Fremont street on 4th floor which was a nicer view but much nosier at night. Our room was clean and an excellent value for $18 per night. It included a flat screen TV with some channels, nice king size bed and adequate (if small) clean washroom. We enjoyed the casino and M restaurant - with an excellent Prime Rib special for only $9.99 (less with our players card and 2 for 1). Unfortunately no pool, but access to a surprisingly nice, quet pool on the roof of Binions (both hotels now owned by same group) I liked the hotel - we stayed a few nights on the strip as well and am starting to prefer the downtown atmosphere. We walked to many places easily (Fremont, Golden Nuggett, California, Main Street Station, El Cortez and others) and never felt the heat of the walks on the strip or the length. When on strip we are always driving and can never have more then a few drinks. Downtown, easily walked and less pressure if drinking a little too much.

The staff we encountered were all very helpful and seemed happy to serve us. When we arrived at the hotel, we gave the desk clerk $20 and asked if there was any possibility of receiving a complimentary upgrade and she gave us a petite suite!! We spent 6 wonderful nights on the 14th floor of the South tower in a room with a king size bed, two sofas and a 32\" LCD television for less than $190 including the $20 tip! The room was very clean, spacious, and even had a refrigerator and an in room safe large enough to hold a laptop computer and any other belongings. The bathroom was also spacious and had a long vanity with two sinks. The view from the room overlooked the canopy of Freemont Street, and although we could hear the performances in the evenings, we were able to drown them out watching television. We were only in the room one evening before the performances were over, so the noise really was not an issue. We were in Vegas after all and therefore slept late and stayed out late! Freemont Street is great! It was very nice to be able to walk out onto the street and go from casino to casino without having to worry about traffic or walking in the hot sun during the middle of the day. It was remarkably clean for a large city with so many tourists, we were pleasantly surprised. We found Freemont Street to be much cleaner than \"The Strip\" from our experience. The food at the hotel was fantastic, as was the service. We also found several buffets in the surrounding casinos that were fantastic, and enjoyed all our meals in the Freemont Street area. The Paradise Buffet was probably our favorite place to eat. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there during our trip. Most of the restaurants and buffets have really good deals on food. We are blackjack players so we did not play slots except for goofing around a few times. If you are a blackjack player, be sure to ask the pit bosses for complimentary food before leaving the tables because you do not earn comps for food on your cards. Most of the casinos in the Freemont area make you ask for comps and do not offer them on the cards, but a couple do. Also, if you look around the area, you can find casinos that offer 3 to 2 payouts on blackjacks as opposed to the 6 to 5 you find in most of them. There is easy access to \"The Strip\" via The Deuce (double decker bus) by walking about a block down Freemont to the bus stop. It is only $7 per 24 hour period to ride as much as you like. It took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to get to the strip from the hotel. We spent a day at the strip, went back to the hotel, then returned to the strip that evening to see a show at The Mirage. Freemont Street was more our speed because we did not enjoy the wall to wall people and walking long distances to go between casinos on the strip in 105 degree weather under full sun. The temperature was not that bad, but it dehydrates you quickly so be prepared to take along water. Overall we highly recommend the Four Queens and Freemont Street!

The value is outstanding having stayed there for 17 nights for a total of $540 in June/July, room service came every single day, the rooms are very clean and the air conditioning is excellent.

The store downstairs is great for convenience and there is a walgreens (supermarket) just one block away. One of the highlights downtown is the Fremont Street Experience.

Magnolias and the Chicago Brewing Co at the 4 Queens are both great. Binions has the best cheeseburgers in the area and hennesys does really good homestyle meals at great prices. The best buffet by far is at the Golden Nugget with a great variety including asian and seafood.

We did enjoy watching the light show and seeing the artisans, and there were bands playing from time to time right outside. We walked around the area for a couple of hours.

The wife and I traveled to LV for our wedding anniversary, and we knew we wanted to stay downtown. After searching TripAdvisor, we had decided on the Golden Nugget, but they didn't have a room available for the full length of our stay. We then opted to book at the Four Queens, and am I ever glad we did. We arrived after getting our rental acr at the airport, and the valet took care of our bags and parked our car. Check in was a breeze, but we got a bit lost finding our room. We booked a room in the tower closest to Fremont Street, so you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators for that tower. The path wasn't marked very well, but we managed to run into someone who pointed the way. After you find the elevators the first time, they're very easy to find. We got up to our room, and I placed the night lock in the opening to hold the door open for the valet. A knock at the door a few minutes later was from Security, who was wlking the hallway and saw the open door so he checked to make sure everything was OK in the room. The valet arrived a few minutes later, and also knocked and waited until I opned the door to come in. As others have said, the rooms are not huge, but there's plenty to do that you don't need to spend a lot of time in the room. I would have liked a bigger chair to sit in, but I understand why there isn't one, and I could live without it. The bathroom could have been bigger for me, but once again, they have to work with the footprint of an old hotel building, so they have to make do with the size of the bathroom. We called and asked for extra towels and pillows, and they arrived within ten minutes without any issues at all. Rooms were taken care of every day, sometimes within an hour of us leaving the room in the morning. We enjoyed playing at many of the downtown hotels, but the El Cortez and the Four Queens were our two favorites. The El Cortez is just down from the Fremont Street Experience, which is where we found the lowest table game limits. But I had a blast playing at the Four Queens. The look of the casino is classic, a Victorian-like decor. A dealer taught me how to play Pai Gow Poker, which I had never understood before, and I became addicted to it. I also enjoy playing Blackjack and Roulette, and played those as well. A dealer named Junie was a pleasure to be with. I lost $100 at her table one night and walked away laughing and happy. She seems to want you to enjoy your game, and was just a great personality. We will definitely look for her specifically when we return. We used the rental car several days, decided to get away from the downtown casino scene for a while. We visited the Red Rock Canyon historic area, a beautiful 13 mile scenic drive through beatuiful scenery. The next day we went to Valley of Fire State Park, and found we didn't have enough time to see all of the park. This place was absolutely amazing, being an arm's length away from 4000 year-old indian petroglyphs. I will return to Valley of Fire Park again, it was just stunning. Of course, you can't forget the Fremont Street Experience, a free light show on the canopy that covers six blocks of Fremont Street. I found myself watching my watch and leaving the gaming tables to go see the light shows. I highly recommend the Four Queens.

Downtown was a lot different than the strip (for one thing, as others have noted, there are none of the \"porn-slappers\" downtown).

As a person alone, with no set itinerary, I had no problem getting from downtown to the strip using the Sam's Town shuttle. It has two stops downtown, then goes directly to Sam's Town. From Sam's Town it goes to Harrah's and then Riviera so you have the option of mid strip or north strip. The shuttle was never more than half full and it was all just tourists like myself.

We got a regular room next to the Fremont Street Experience. Since we were out until after midnight every night, having room next to FSE did not bother us at all. Our experience at the Check-in counter was fast & friendly. We did find out that there is a $3.00 per night charge for the parking garage, but that was fine with us. Not having to find a place to park each night was worth the $3.00 charge. We were given a parking pass to show the garage attendant & remember to keep your little white ticket. You need to give it to the attendant each time you leave the parking garage. Our room was cozy, but very clean. Hotels we have stayed at on the strip were not as clean as our room at Four Queens was. We were pleasantly surpirsed by this. Our bed was comfortable but our door always seemed to slam shut, even when were trying to close it quietly. Once we got into our room, we could not hear people through paper thin walls. We just heard the occassional door slam shut. It was no big deal to us. Something people may want to know about is that in the tower we stayed in, there is not an ice machince on each floor. There was one on ours, but we just found that a little unusual. Our room had a coffee maker, hair dryer & a televison with a decent selection of channels. Who spends much time inside a hotel room in Las Vegas anyway! We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Queens & will stay here again. We did not have a good dining expereince at Magnolia's. Our food was bland & the service was \"okay\" at best. The slots were fun & payed out pretty well. Our favorite part was the Roulette table. We stopped by there 3 times & each time the person running the table was both helpful & knowledgeable. We enjoyed having everything we could want within walking distance. Walgreens is less than a 5 minute walk away. Four Queens does not have a swimming pool, but we were told at check-in that Binion's lets the guests of Four Queens use their swimming pool.

I dont think that it was any bigger than other rooms, but we had a view in two directions and only people on one side of us. We dropped our luggage off and went downstairs. The first place we went to was the players club to sign up for our cards. We were given a deck of cards in a metal case and a voucher each for Magnolia's Cafe for two for one entres. I was given an extra voucher as it was my birthday. We went over to Magnolia'a Cafe, but got sidetracked at the Craps table. There was a crowd so I watched for a minute. The table was hopping so I tried my luck. 10 minutes later and $40.00 up we went to the Cafe. There was a small line but we did not have to wait long. The hostess was nice and friendly. Our waitress was really nice and very fast. The food was hot and tasted great. We had no problem using the vouchers and off we went. Fremont st is a great place to watch people. We went down to Mermaids and recieved our beads, played some slots and actually won! I came in here last year and played. We had a great waitress last year. She was still there this year. Later we went back to the 4 Queens. My friend played some roulette while I played a little more craps. We both won a little. The dealers at the 4 Queens are great. They are very helpful. We went back up to our room. It was cleaned, everything looked great. When you walk into the room on the right side is a large closet. On the left side is the bathroom. In the bathroom there is a tub/shower combo. There is a single sink with a large amount of counter space. They had an ice bucket, plastic cups, shampoo, lotion, and a small bar of soap on the counter. There was also a hair dryer unit mounted on the wall. The bathroom itself was very clean. Many of the floor tiles were cracked, but that really did not matter. The towels were fine, not big and fluffy, but you have to remember where you are staying. This is not the Ritz, but it is very nice. In the room there is a place to put your suitcase. There is also a stand for the flat screen TV that has 4 drawers under the TV. Next to the stand is the desk and chair. We had two queen beds in the room and between them was a small nightstand with a safe. The bedding was not old or new and looked nice. The blankets are thinner than mine at home, but that was easy to remedy, I called and asked for another and it was brought to me within 10 minutes.

There were specials everywhere on food, drink, shows, nightclubs, rooms, etc. Happy hours specials being run all day. We walked from Mandalay Bay all the way to the Sahara. Took all day as we stopped everywhere. That evening we had dinner at Magnolia's Cafe. We had a different waitress, but she was just as great as our first waitress.

Coffee left in the room was regualr, and I had to request decaf but received it the next morning. The room was clean and fresh. Housekeeping did a very good job everyday and were very friendly. The room itself was ok in size. However, the bathroom was tiny, and I mean tiny. The hallway was quiet, I very seldom heard doors closing or people in the hallway. The 4 elevators to the tower were quick and I never had a long wait for one. Soda machines are on the odd numbered floors and the ice machines are on the even numbered floors. Needless to say I did not venture to the other floor for ice. I would have liked to have an easy chair in the room as I do like to relax and sit and read . I also had some friends in and out of my room several times and easy chairs would have been better to sit and catch up. Instead we sat on the beds. I ate at Magnolia's my last morning and with the player's card it, received a discount on breadfast. I also had luck in the casino.

When we first arrived, we were already more than tipsy as we had met some people who were Vegas vets at the airport before we even headed out of Cedar Rapids, IA (they kept buying drink after drink and giving us all kinds of tips for places to check out and what to do), so I really cannot comment on the check-in service as it was a little fuzzy. :) However, the staff was great - very friendly - throughout the hotel for everything else we needed during our stay, although I have to say that the wait at Magnolias was quite long the time we went. The food there, however, was excellent and their was way more than we could eat. there for a very good price, especially when you add in the buy-one-get-one-free coupon that you can pick up. We did not really eat much else here as we were too busy exploring downtown. The room itself was a clean. The bed was comfy. It was a very basic room with a decent view at an affordable price in a fun area. That is everything I was looking for. I forgot to take pics of the room until we were getting ready to leave and it was messed up, but I included the shots just to give an idea of what the basic rooms look like. The view was pretty good from our room too. Again, I took a shot of the view night but it was not that good of a shot. There are also some excellent bargins at the gift shop at the hotel and the staff here were super friendly. You can use the pool at the top of Binions as long as you are staying here too, so although this hotel does not have a pool, you always have this option. We never had time to check it out, but I would definitely think that it would be worth a peek as it is on the 28th floor so it would probably be a nice relaxing time with a great view of downtown.

Though not necessarily 'kid friendly', the price is right and the location is perfect. We arrived around 2 on a Friday afternoon, and though the room had not yet been cleaned we were able to get keys and store our luggage there. Check-in was very quick and staff were friendly. We booked a package and chose the 'low end' price, so the room we ended up with was not newly renovated. Though it did have the flat screen TV, the rest was pretty old and we actually had a handicapped bathroom. No big deal but it did make for an awfully high toilet for the kids. Nice to have a coffee maker, ironing board and a large safe, otherwise pretty standard. The room was clean, just tired looking. The big draw here is the location. Really, virtually all the downtown properties are central, but this one is dead center on Fremont Street. Not only that, the access is a breeze since you can go through the doors near the valet and bypass the entire casino. With no waits for the elevator we were able to leave our room and be on Fremont street in about 3 minutes! We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel/casino, but there is a decent selection. Of course, staying downtown means a quick walk is all it takes to get pretty much any food you want. I have to admit, we love the Gold Spike, and now it is being renovated into a 'boutique' property so we'll see how that pans out.

A tip is if you are really picky and like to complain stay at really expensive places on the strip. The casino was small but had lots of low limit table games with good pay tables (common downtown I played roulette at Binions and they have $2 min). I signed up for the players card at the 4Q and got a free deck of cards in a collectable tin then had a $8 Prime Rib dinner at Magnolias that was excellent. If you take off the value of the free gift I got, you could say dinner cost me $5! The parking garage costs guest $3 day but remember it's also $15-$20 a nite cheaper here.

The hotel is located in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience (can be noisy) so if you value some peace and quiet make sure you request a room facing AWAY from the Fremont Street experience. Also for those of you wanting to go to the strip the bus stop is a stone's throw away. The bus is called the deuce and you get get a 24 hour unlimited ride pass for $5. The Fremont Street Experience really takes off aat night so I usually hit the strip in the day and head back to the Four Queens at night. Chicago Brewing Company (one of their restaurants) has great pizza and beer. Their other restaurant (magnolias) leaves a little bit to be desired. For those of you who insist on staying on the strip you may want to try staying downtown sometime. I think you will be surprised at how affordable and fun it could be. Where on the strip can you walk into a casino bar and buy an ice cold Corona or Heineken for $2.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cFour Queens was pretty good\u201d", "Author": "TexasG1RL", "ReviewID": "UR21973887", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at the Four Queens and had a great time.

We weren't interested in a pool scene or lap of luxury rooms for this stay -- we just needed a clean room to get a shower and good night sleep in. Four Queens definitely delivered. Situated in the heart of downtown on Fremont Street, you cannot beat this location to everything you may want. We arrived late evening and checked in immediately upon arrival. Room was clean, North Tower, and several floors above the Fremont Street Experience (18th). The room had a king size bed (soft and extremely comfortable), plasma tv, view of the mountains and several casinos, efficient air conditioning, and sufficient bathroom space (lower pressure water but did its job). We went down to the casino once we got situated to get a feel for the tables and slots. I will write a separate review for the casino and places we ate at another time and just mention everything briefly now. We had lunch at Rosemary's on Sahara Ave using their prix fixe coupon, and it was worth every penny. Although it is a bit of a hike by rental car or cab, do not miss out on this dining experience. We ventured to the Strip for only one night to see comedian Jim Gaffigan which was a great show at Mandalay Bay, but I realized why I loved the downtown area more -- simply a better group of people to be around and not the stuffy \"look at me - look at me\" types that seem to be more common at the Strip hotels. Downtown is also less congested with traffic and people and one can enjoy themselves more and not feel as confined as you would on the Strip. For me, you simply get more bang for your buck Downtown. We checked out several other casinos while staying downtown and were impressed with the friendliness of not only the people but the staff from the cashiers to the floor managers. We found we were more likely to get comped than any other experience we had previously on the Strip. Finally, we ate at Hugo's cellar at the Four Queens which was an amazing meal from beginning to end. I will review the overall experience seperately from this review. Overall, the room at the Four Queens is what it is, a room, as I am sure is the same for most of the hotels near Fremont Street. Check in was a cinch, check out was a breeze, the staff was excellent, there was a variety of food to choose from as well as the Chicago Brew Pub which had excellent hand-crafted beers on tap. My recommendation is this: if you are used to staying in suites and have that level of expectation, do not stay at the 4 Queens. If you want a younger crowd and a pool / club scene, do not stay at the 4 Queens. If you, for some reason, go to bed at 9pm every night, the noise from Fremont Street will keep you up, so don't stay downtown let alone at the Four Queens. However, if you want a relaxed atmosphere, have simple expectations, want to be able to have your money go a little farther, and have access to great restaurants and good people, then Four Queens is for you.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wrightwood, California", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not great\u201d", "Author": "KimInCali", "ReviewID": "UR18146457", "Content": "Well I stay downtown in Vegas quite often and decided to give Four Queens a shot.

I mean LOUD! Gambling is always fun at the Queens. All the table people were friendly and even at the keno room the drinks came fast. Strike two was their comps aren't as easy to use. In other hotels you can use your players card at any restaurant to get free or discounted food. At the Four Queens you needed to wait for a host to give you restaurant comps. Hugos' Cellar is located in the Four Queens and is probably the best Downtown restaurant. The last strike was they charged for parking.

We completely enjoyed our time at the Four Queens. The staff was friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. We arrived at 10 AM and were told they had a room ready for us immediately. We asked for the quietest room they could give us, and that is what we got. I had called ahead to make the request and the room they gave us was blissfully quiet. We never heard the noise from the Freemont Street Experience. Our room was clean, newly re-furbished, small and quite pleasant. The maid service was good. On check-in we requested a refrigerator for my husband's medication, and it was delivered within minutes to our room. Based on recommendations from here at Trip Adviser, we ate 3 times at the 4 Queen's Magnolia's Cafe. The food was fine, the service slow, and it was lit up like a bowling alley. But, it was easy and accessible and our breakfast at the 4 Queens was a 100% better than the breakfast we had at the tonier Golden Nugget down the street, and quite a bit less costly. At first we thought we might have made a mistake staying downtown. But, after taking the bus back and forth to the strip 2 times and dealing with the hassle and crowds on the strip, we realized that staying downtown was the way to go for a couple of middle-aged people who do not want to be around little children. There is nothing for children to do downtown other than see the laser light show at night. And, that is the only time we saw kids, at night, and not for long. All in all I would recommend the 4 Queens to anyone interested in coming to Las Vegas to gamble and not to those coming for the \"spa\" experience. The hotel does not have a pool or spa. But, downtown does have $5 blackjack all night, $2 roulette and a lot of loose slot machines.

So we wanted to try downtown. The four queens with air for seven days was 440.00 pp. on hotwire.The bad thing with hotwire is that you dont know your flights until you buy the trip, our flights were HORRIBLE!!!!! When we got there at 10:00 pm our check in took a total of 10 minutes and the desk clerk was very nice and helpful as to what perks/comps we could aquire and how. I requested a room in the south tower due to reading trip advisor reviews stating that it was newer and more updated. They gave us what I requested with no problem.The room was in comparison to a super 8 or comfort inn. It was very nice and clean.Decor was ugly but new. We stayed on the fourth floor in the south tower. There was absolutely no problem with elevaters and no wait to get one. When we exited the elevater we were right in the casino.The maid service was also very good. We had two queen size beds and they were very comfortable and they looked like new. We slept very well and was quite pleased. 32 inch flat screen tv was very nice. Our remote batteries were dead I called the front desk and had new batteries brought to me in 10 minutes.The air conditioning was perfect. The room was no smaller than any average size hotel room. The bathroom was small but was ok with the door closed, ha ha.The shower had good pressure and never a problem with hot water. One thing I didnt like is ,there was no exhaust fan , bathroom was very steamy until the door was opened. Good thing I was with my sister. (due to lack of privacy from door being opened.) Dealers were nice and friendly,Casino host was attittudy but helpful.Booze girls were terrible, Once at the slot machines I had no change for a tip and gave the girl a 50 cent token and she rolled her eyes and I never seen her again, and this was after tipping her a doller per drink for more than 2 hours!

So I showed her on the menu that I just looked at and she said \"thats a sub not a hogie\"? So I just left cause I was so mad at this point and went to the freemont and got chinese take out. Just to let the ladies know,, A bum attempted to rob me outside on freemont street in front of the fremont hotel and casino, but a bicycle cop seen him in action and arrested him approx. 2 am.

We got our stuff together (my brother and his new wife and two kids were there also) and headed down for the show. The last show was at midnight, so we waited with a lot of other folks for the show, no show. Later we heard that the sound was broken so they canceled it. Very disappointing, it should have been announced somehow, and this may be our last chance to see it. After this, things got even worse (on a dumb business decision level). The 4 Queens, and the other casino's downtown have their club card places only open from 8am to midnight. We played some, but not having players cards took quite a bit of the fun out of it. The hotel room was more than we really expected with what we payed for it, clean, spacious, and a great TV system.

For one thing, many of the hotel's rooms face Fremont Street, which features loud bursts of music every half hour between 7 p.m. and midnight, every night. If you are an early to bed type or are bringing young children, either request a room that is as far from Fremont Street as possible, or just don't stay at this hotel. In addition to the noise, downsides included the fact that you have to weave through the incredibly smoky casino to get to the hotel's restaurants; the fact that there is no pool or hot tub or anything at all to do at the hotel if you want to take a break from gambling; and the fact that after we moved to a new room, the tub faucet leaked all night and the room smelled of smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. On the plus side, their Magnolia's restaurant had good food, and the light show at the Fremont Street Experience is fun. A big issue to consider is the general location of the hotel. If you aren't familiar with Vegas, please note that the Four Queens is nowhere near the more famous and fabulous hotel/casinos such as the Bellagio, Venetian, Luxor, and Paris. To get to them, either you need a car or you jam yourself onto a city bus called the Deuce, which can take 40-50 minutes to get to the newer casinos at rush hour and can be standing-room-only crowded. If all you want from your stay is to gamble and smoke cigarettes all day, this hotel will probably be fine for you.

The elevator for the North Tower was 20 steps away (I counted for this review) from Fremont St and our room from the elevator was the same distance. Great!!

We had reservations at the Venetian hotel on the strip but I arrived in Vegas one day early, so I got a priceline deal at the Four Queens. Overall I have to say it wasn't too bad. The rooms were much better than I had expected for a 2 star place - they were very clean, comfy beds, good service etc. The hotel was a bit old and rundown. There were many signs of neglect as well - the ice machine in my hallway was overrun with water and sludge which had seeped into the carpet. Aside from that - the main downside was the location of the hotel. If you're into the older buildings and vintage vegas than this might be your dream place. I have to admit that I did not feel safe walking outside the hotel at night (or much less any time of the day). BTW - there isn't much that makes me nervous or feel unsafe, since I grew up in Baltimore and now live in downtown DC. Keep in mind that the Four Queens is a very different vegas experience than one gets while staying on the main strip. Aside from not feeling as safe - I noticed a large number of vagrants, homless people and drunks in the \"freemont street\" area. The whole area around the Four Queens also had a strange earieness to it - like an old vintage carnival horror movie with run down buildings, blinking ligts that stopped working decades ago and the heavy stench of dank cigars. Overall - it's certainly a memorable experience staying at the Four Queens.

I read all the reviews on the downtown hotels and the most consistent recommendations kept coming from the reviews on the Four Queens Hotel. After staying there, I must agree with the reviews. The Four Queens is a great hotel. I arrived before 12:00 pm and was able to check in as my room was available. The desk clerk was fast and very friendly. (I usually stay at the Strat and the lines to check in are horrendous). They give you a fun book that has some really good two for one coupons. My room elevators was right off of the lobby area which I found to be very convenient being that you didn't have to walk the entire length of the Casino to get to your room. I give the Four Queens high points for that alone. I was given a room on the 15th floor room 1525. Upon arriving in my room the first thing I noticed was the spaciousness of the room. Two queen beds, flat screen tv and desk.When I entered the bathroom I noticed a handicap chair and bars. They had given me a handicap room. The bathroom was very spacious also. I had asked for a room not facing the Fremont St Exp. but when I looked down I could see the side of the canopy. Although I could hear the music when it started on the hour it was very muted so did not really bother me. My views was mostly of the Golden Nugget and not the mountains in which I am particularly fond of. I found the dining choices at the Four Queens to be a little bit lacking as they have no buffet. Magnolia's is an excellent choice but can get a little crowded around the dinner hour. You have to pick your times to eat there. usually late morning and evening works best. This is a non problem as the Fremont's buffet is directly across the street and on Sundays they have an all day champagne brunch/buffet. There are so many food choices within walking distance of the Four Queens that I never ate at the same place twice. I loved the proximity of the other establishments. I also loved the whole atmosphere of downtown and the entertainment. The Four Queens casino has a good selection of slot machines and they seemed to give you a nice chance of winning. The drink service was quite good also. I overall felt very comfortable gambling in their casino it never felt overcrowded and the people were friendly.

After countless trips making the rounds (Boyd properties, Fitz, Plaza, Vegas Club, Binion's, even splurging for the Golden Nugget) I feel this is the best deal downtown. We checked in on Monday for a four night stay. Check-in staff were friendly and helpful. My husband asked if a suite upgrade would be possible. Yes, we got one for double the room rate we were being charged. It looked exactly like the mini suite in the pic on the website. The armoire has plenty of room on each side of the tv to hide your dirty clothes. :-P It's hard to see in the picture, but there's a fridge with an ice bucket and wine glasses next to the desk and chair. We were on the second floor, but back from the road. I could barely hear the Fremont Street Experience the rare times I was in the room during the evening. We lucked into seeing the Firemen's Combat Challenge World Competition. They were competing right outside the casino. The casino has a half-price ticket outlet. We recommend seeing Larry G. Jones. We saw him back when he did 1001 voices and he was terrific! Thoroughly entertaining. I think he's up to 1003 voices now. We wanted to see him this trip, but he only works weekends now. Good to see him moving up. The 4 Queen's casino personnel are very friendly. My husband played the single deck blackjack until they very politely told him to stop. I played the black jack switch and a new game called California Draw. I don't imagine it will last if everyone is as lucky as I was when Dezdemona taught me the game. She showed me how much trips, two-pair, and even a straight flush paid. I can't wait to go back and try my luck again. The Casino Cage is being remodeled. They were squeezed into a small spot by the restrooms. I never saw less then three cashiers working and never waited in line. Noel was very friendly when he gave me my big winnings from the CA Draw game. We ate at Magnolia's several times. The staff were very smiley and friendly. Wanted to try Hugo's, but too pricey for me. Hubby wanted the $40 rack of lamb. Maybe next time. Even leaving out the fact that I experienced my luckiest night gambling here, I think the Four Queens is the best deal downtown.

We were seated and waited for about 5 minutes, the a waiter came out to take our order we informed him we wanted it to go, he promptly left our table without saying anything else. We waited for about 5 more minutes just about ready to leave another waiter came to our table to take our order, he took the order and then promptly told us to move from the table and move to a bench and wait. Not what I call customer service. We dined at the Fremont the next morning, and the Golden Nuggett at night. On the third morning we decided to try Magnolia's again for breakfast.

This was our first time staying at this hotel, so we were anxious to see what it would be like since we had heard it was recently refurbished. We booked our room over the phone with a casino rate based on our play from our previous visit in May. We did not receive a mail offer and had to call to ask for the casino rate. Check in was very easy with no line at all. The front desk clerk was very cordial and made the experience very pleasant. Our room was in the south tower, room 1033 for four nights. We had a king, n/s room. The accommodations were nice, with new fixtures, beds and a smaller plasma television. They missed a few things when refurbishing this hotel, though. The shower curtain was old and in desperate need of replacement. There was a smashed spider stuck to the outside of it that looked like it had been there for a while. The air conditioner/heater unit and controller were disgusting and the smoke alarm also needs to be replaced (see photos). I don't get how they could spend so much on updating the rooms and forget the details. We didn't notice a work-out room or a swimming pool while we were there, so those are definitely negatives if those amenities are important to you. My sister and her family stayed at the Golden Nugget, so I went down to visit them at the pool while we were there. We stayed at the GN on our last trip to Vegas, and it was very nice. My in-laws had four free nights at the Plaza and were there for a slot tournament, so we had the room to ourselves. The location of the Four Queens is great since you are smack dab, right in the middle of things on Fremont Street. There is a McDonalds right across the street and a Walgreens within walking distance. We ate at Magnolia's, which is in the hotel, with a buy-one, get-one free coupon from the American Casino Guide (buy on the web or at book stores $14.95-well worth it!). The prime rib was excellent and very reasonable. I would highly recommend this restaurant. We did spend some time in the casino and when we went to the slot club to ask if we had any comps or cash coming back, the slot club attendants were VERY rude. They could really benefit from some basic customer service training. We noticed this on our last visit, and again on this visit. My father-in-law also commented on how rude they were to both he and my mother-in-law. Even though they missed a few things when updating the rooms and the slot club attendants were rude, we will definitely stay at this hotel again since the bed was comfortable and the location is good.

We have never stayed Downtown before and thought we would give it a try. For a great price we figured how bad could it be? FQ exceeded our expectations!! CHECK IN: The front desk check in was wonderful.... no wait...friendly..and they honored all of our requests. I had asked for a King bed, non smoking, facing the Fremont street side of the hotel. ROOMS: We received a room on the fifth floor (518). We loved facing the Fremont Street Experience it was great! The Four Queens is one of the only hotels downtown that actually has rooms under the \"canopy\" facing Fremont Street. We could watch the light show right from our room! (people watching was great too!) The even numbered rooms face fremont street. There was some noise from the light show and they play music all day long. It stops at Midnight. No big deal! We kind of enjoyed the music. CASINO The Casino was good. We saw many other people winning! We didn't!! PARKING Parking was easy. We self parked our car, but they had Valet also. On Saturday night they allowed us VIP PARKING even though the sign said the lot was full. NO POOL The FQ doesn't have a pool, but honestly...we were so busy, we didn't miss not having it. RESTAURANTS We ate at Magnolias twice, the food was average, cheap enough, the wait staff left a little to be desired, we had a little language barrier problem with the girl that got the drinks in the restaurant, but the server was average...... Overall it was AVERAGE!! DOWNTOWN AREA The Downtown area has honestly been revitalized. They have so much to offer. There was a Ariel performance, a Motorcycle stunt show, a stage with a variety of performers, plenty of Kiosks selling gifts and snacks. In the evening they brought out rolling bars selling adult beverages. It seemed like a big happy, party, with a fun atmosphere. I will say the FQ is not a Luxury Property, But they don't charge a Luxury price! It fit our needs and I would recommend it to people that are looking for a clean, nice, friendly hotel in downtown...... We have stayed at Flamingo, Harrahs, Monte Carlo,Luxor, and Palace Station.

Had I not read it at this website, I would not have known to do it. The room had a new flat-screen T.V., which I only watched a little. The air conditioner kicked \u2018tailfeathers\u2019 and kept the room cool since it was 114 degrees outside. Our rooms looked out over the hotel canopy and partially over the Fremont Experience. Music started around 8 p.m. and stopped at 12 a.m. Who the heck is in their room sleeping at Midnight while visiting Las Vegas anyway? Take handy-dandy foam earplugs with you if you have a doubt. The casino was active and nice and had plenty of modern, fun slot machines, and was comparable to other casinos as far as variety and pay-offs. We ate at Magnolia\u2019s Restaurant, and to me \u2013 the food was just \u2018so-so\u2019. I wish we\u2019d ventured out to places to eat outside of FQ, but didn\u2019t to save time. We did not try Hugo\u2019s Cellar. Acting on the advice of other reviewers, I tried the Deuce (double-decker bus) to travel from the FQ in Old Vegas to The Strip. There is a lot more to traveling that way than meets the eye. Reviewers had described it as a convenient way to get around. I did not find that to be true. As a not-so-physically-fit 50-Something, to have to walk the distance from the FQ to the Deuce depot to catch the bus in the blazing heat of the late morning was almost unbearable. It was much further than described by an FQ employee. Once I arrived, I had to stand in a long line of others waiting to board in the heat. I was so glad that my mother had decided not to join me, as she would not have been able to withstand it. I did buy the $5 all day pass as I wanted to visit various places along the Strip. It is $2 each time you board if you don\u2019t have the pass. The Deuce was cramped, crowded and slow. From the beginning boarding, to the final boarding, and the times in-between, it was the same. The seats were all full and people were standing in the aisles jammed together like sardines as the Deuce inched its way along the strip. Folks, this was during a weekday! One time I was standing at one of the stops to board, and there were so many people waiting to board, the bus stopped and took on about 4 people and pulled off. The remainder of us had to wait in the heat until the next bus came along and there was pushing and shoving to get on the next one. My return trip back to the Four Queens from MGM Grand took at least an hour. The only other option is to take a taxi. I believe if I go to Vegas again, I may opt for the taxi. The Four Queens may not be a 5-Star hotel like some of the newer ones, but it is certainly worth more than the charge to stay there. If I get the chance to go to Vegas again, I would definitely stay at the FQ. So should you.

If, for instance, you are not satisfied unless your bathroom is huge, made of marble, and equipped with a phone by the toilet, then don't stay at Four Queens. Similarly, don't stay there if you need 25000 thread count sheets and beds that are fit for Diamond Jim Brady. If that stuff is more your style, run, don't walk, to places like Bellagio, THE Hotel, and The Venetian. And bring a great deal of cash and your best posing clothes while you're at it. If, however, you are looking for a clean, abeit small room to lay your head for a couple of nights, and don't mind staying Downtown as opposed to The Strip, I found Four Queens to be excellent, and a superb value as well. My friend and I had a very good experience, starting with the price, which totaled $200 for three nights, including Friday and Saturday night, when Vegas hotels siphon money at the same rate as Keno. For that $200, we had NO WAIT at check in, and the woman who checked us in was kind, courteous, and even let us check in a couple of hours early. When I visited Paris to gamble the next day, I saw throngs of frustrated tourists waiting to check in...and probably paying triple the price. Yes, the room is fairly small, and yes, the decor is dated. But the room was immaculate, there was a plasma TV, and the bed was fine. Think about it: when you are sleeping, do you really notice how expensive the mattress is? The room was quiet, though to be fair, that may have had as much to do with who our neighbors were as anything else. We had a splendid view of a parking garage, but when in Vegas, the only time I stare out the window is to bemoan my blackjack losses. So for that, a parking garage seems appropriate. None of the noise from the hectic Fremont Street leaked into our room, but then again, that may have had as much to do with our room placement as anything else. The casino was friendly and accommodating, with plenty of cheap tables, even on the weekend. Plus, about 10 other casinos (literally) are within walking distance, and Golden Nugget is right across the street. If you really like to gamble and jump from casino to casino, Downtown has The Strip beat hands down. The crowd certainly is older and more \"middle class\" than down the road, but again, it's what you value in your Vegas trip. In addition, joining the players' club was a snap, and was given a free deck of cards for doing so, which not one other casino club did. Parking cost $3 a day, which I was more than willing to pay considering what our room cost. To sum: If you want a clean, comfortable room with a very accommodating staff at a bargain rate, Four Queens just might be King of Downtown.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "LVFUNTIME", "ReviewID": "UR8006941", "Content": "We stayed at the Four Queens June 17th thru June 21st 2007.

I would recommend this place for people who like the old part of Vegas and also for people who are on a budget and don't mind rooms that are basically just for sleeping and showering!!

Not only was there the disgusting smell of cigarettes, but then someone had sprayed a ton of cheap-smelling offensive floral deodorizer all over the room - when I opened the door it was enough to gag us both. We opened all of the windows (we were on the 19th floor), and left for two hours hoping the smell would be gone when we returned (it was 4 am when we got back). I requested to be transferred to a nonsmoking room the next day - I was told I could get a room on the 7th floor - right about the same height as the canopy, light, and music show. I knew this wasn't going to work as the noise from the show was loud on the 19th floor - I knew it would be intolerable on the 7th (I was in Vegas to work for four of the seven days and needed to be able to sleep). I requested a room in the other tower and was told there were none available and so were stuck for six nights (I tried to move to another hotel, but due to a convention there were none available for the duration of my stay). The bathroom was disgusting - the caulk was split and mould was growing in the cracks, and there were chunks of dust and dirt hanging from the ceiling vent. We asked to have the vent cleaned - it never was. We had no heat in the room and froze every night we were there. We complained about this several times to no avail. We really did not appreciate the evening we came back from hours of fun on the strip to a 60 degree room - I guess the maid was hot. We called the desk to complain about the cold and asked to have someone sent up (at 11pm) to check on the heat. The engineer said the air was on the heater was not, and there was nothing he could do. The staff, except for Anthony the valet, was not friendly at all, and most (including the ones at Magnolia's) seemed inconvenienced by our very presence. The final straw was that on the day we came back from the Hoover dam and all of the guest elevators in the hotel were out of service. We took a service elevator to our floor and were \"chewed out\" by a cleaning lady for using the elevator that was for service use only.

(At least there were no pubic hairs to be seen in this bathroom) I called about the toilet and they brought up some big and loud as crap machine to soak up the toilet water that made it's way out onto the carpet outside of the bathroom. They left the machine in the room for many, many hours while we were out gambling. When we got back to the room in the early morning the machine was still there roaring away. I unplugged it and put it out into the hallway. Was the toilet water drenched carpet dry? NO. It was better but certainly not dry. I suppose we could have changed rooms again but we were only going to be there for two more nights and my mother didn't want to bother with it. At least we had our house shoes to wear so our feet didn't have to touch that toilet water germ-filled carpet. The next day our A/C went out. I called about it and they sent someone up to correct the problem ASAP. It worked fine after that. I found the front desk staff to be very nice, friendly and helpful. Even though we had room problems, they were diligent about getting those problems corrected. We had fun in the casino but the the servers did not come around too often for drink orders. Had great luck at the ELVIS slot machine located near the players club desk. That machine seemed to be paying out the whole time we were there. I finally got a chance to get on it right before we left for the airport and won $160.00 playing pennies, not even max bet pennies, and still won. Might not sound like a lot but I am by no means a high roller and was happy to win that much. I only put $20.00 in. Had a blast at the BJ tables. Lost the first night but made up for it after that. We also played at Binion's which I love. Aways seem to find decent slot machines there and have a blast playing BJ. So, would I stay at the Four Queens again. NO. I would rather pay a bit more and stay at the Nugget. It is nicer and seems to be kept up WAY better than the Queens. Oh, one more thing, the rooms were indeed renovated and had the big screen TV. But, the choices of bedspreads and curtains were/are appalling. I know this might not matter to many people who read this but the fabric truly looked like it came straight out of the 1970's. Whoever was in charge of choosing those fabrics should be fired and required to go to interior design school.

So if you want \u201cresort\u201d quality, stay on the strip if you can afford over priced rooms. Our room was OK, nice king bed, enough room, the bathroom a bit small, but we only got the $49 a night room, so that is expected. Old looking, but most of downtown in old looking, that\u2019s kinda of the charm of it. Old Vegas feel, before Meg Resort Boom. We were on the first floor of south tower (\u201cnewer\u201d tower), so the elevators weren\u2019t an issue for us. Hugo\u2019s was very nice place to eat for the price ($100 for 2). Had a better meal there than at the Eiffel tower at the Paris (but without the great views). Casino was nice, not huge so you can get lost, be enough open tables and slots (could use a poker room). All TITO slots, not too tight and low table mim gave us a lot of play for our budget. Mostly friendly dealers and staff, small enough were the Hosts and Dealers would remember your name (and get better comps that way). Just a few steps outside to Freemont St and all the other downtown properties (and right next door to the Golden Nugget), so you could take an easy walk to another property and not worry about anything. I\u2019d rate it 2nd best on Freemont Street, right behind the Golden Nugget, which is probably the crown jewel of Downtown Vegas.

They would move us to nonsmoking the following morning. The first room had nice decor, was a comfy room overall, but it still smelled of stale cigarette smoke. We would have happily stayed in that room if the smell had not been there. They moved us to a nonsmoking room after being reminded that they needed to do so the next night and the bed in the second room honestly felt like two box springs on top of each other. We asked to be moved and were told they had rented out all the other nonsmoking rooms. We asked if the mattress could be switched out (another employee had told us 4Q was renovating all the rooms and new mattresses were available, all we had to do was ask) and were at first told this would be no problem. Got to the room to wait for the new matress and were then told that this could not be done because \"only engineers are qualified to do that\". We complained again and miraculously they found us another nonsmoking room with a bed that was not quite so bad but still both of us woke up with aches and pains. There were holes in the towels, sheets, and pillowcases as well in the third room. There were also gouges in the drywall of the room and lukewarm water. The staff acted like they could have cared less for the most part about any of our concerns. Also, don't fall for the time share people in the lobby. We were told that if we went on their sales pitch tour we would get sixty dollars cash. We were thinking of getting a time share eventually anyway so this sounded pretty good to us. And it was a free trip around Vegas so why not! The voucher we received was not redeemable for cash, hotel credit only. When we complained to the supervisor he seriously rolled his eyes at my husband. We ended up using the voucher to eat at Magnolia's, the 24 hour restaurant inside the very smoky casino (they have a glass wall seperating the casino from part of the nonsmoking section), and had a great meal. Service in the restaurant was wonderful too. We also tried the pizza place and really liked the food there. I would some it up as poor customer service in a run- down hotel.

I stayed in the North Tower, on the 8th floor- exactly level with the \"fremont experience.\" I don't know what noise people were complaining of- it was fine. and the lights were pretty through the sheers, and completely hidden when the heavy curtains were pulled. The room was clean, the furnishings not fashionable but decent and in good repair, and the linens were surprisingly soft, great pillows even. The staff were friendly and kind, and I even had a housekeeper interrupt me from returning to my room after brunch to warn me that she hadn't straightened my room yet, and would I like her to do it now.... The place is NOT a three star, probably a 2.5. The Days Inn comes to mind. And the only thing the TV is good for is for puchasing videos- it can do nothing else. but unless you're staying at the Nugget (was sold out) what else might you expect downtown? it's not posh, but it's a Vegas experience for a bargain. Further, you can take the Deuce ($2 double decker bus) down to the Strip- which CAN take forever in traffic, but good views along the way- which is all of a 3-4 minute walk from the hotel front door, THROUGH the Fremont experience. If you haven't been, picture an outdoor shopping outlet with panels way aloft that provide the show in the evening but provide reasonable shade during the day--there are speakers playing a variety of music mounted on posts every 50 feet or so, and as you walk what is essentially a pedestrian mall between the casinos, you'll run into street performers (artists and the like) and vendors of every touristy/mall sort. and don't forget the guys selling cocktails on the street- big plastic yard-long margaritas. So the woman who wrote that you get to the bus through a scary part of town clearly got lost. (how?) Magnolia's is not what people have made it out to be, but prime rib for $6- edible. The breakfast was much better. All in all, so much better than I had anticipated. And perhaps one of the BEST parts about the hotel room? I requested a non-smoking room and I got it.

I ended up turning it so much that it broke - we had to call maintenance. There were not enough plugs near the back of the bed, so we had to make a choice: 1 light on each side of the bed, or 1 light total and the clock. We ended up moving the clock to the plug where the coffee maker was across the room, but that meant resetting it everytime the wall switch was shut off from near the door. I called about that to see if they could get me an extension cord with multiple outlets, but was told, \"Yep - that's the way our rooms are.\" Parking is $3 / day for hotel guests. On the plus side, the room was by far the cheapest available anywhere that I could find (except for the skanky no-name motels). Also, it is very well situated to take advantage of everything downtown has to offer. If I had to do it over again, I'd try the Fitzgerald or spend a bit more and stay at the Golden Nugget.

I requested a king, non smoking in what is supposed to be the nicer tower, ( I can't remember which one it is now). She said they couldn't guarantee that, but they would make the request. I told her the main thing was a non-smoking room. I also advised that our flight would not arrive until 10:00 pm, she made that note as well in case we had flight delays, they would not give our room away. Check in was easy, we got the room we requested (there is only 1 king bed on each floor is what I was told). We took our bags to the room. It was spotless. I was very pleased. We could tell the light show was going on, we could see the top of the canopy, but we hung out in the room for a while, before heading back out to grab a drink and watch the midnight show. It was great to walk out the doors and be on Freemont Street, it was the middle of the week so not very crowded. After the show, we grabbed a bite to eat at McDonalds which was next door and still open. Then went in and crashed, after all it was probably 3am my time. Slept great, the next morning we decided to see if our room at TI was ready, it would be by the time we got there, so we washed our face, brushed our teeth and waited until we got there to take a shower. We didn't use the shower so I don't know about drainage problems.

If you have never been to Las Vegas (and before going with my girlfriend in August, we had never been either) you will undoubtedly be encouraged to stay on the Strip. That is for good reason. The Strip is as amazing as you have heard about and probably more...still, when we arrived we had no idea if staying Downtown was a good or bad thing. Instead of just simple narrative, I will break down the Four Queens, my trip and Vegas in general like this, LOCATION: We arrrived at the Four Queens on a Friday night and were immediately in wonder of the bright, vibrant lighting. The Four Queens is located in the heart of the Fremont Experience, adjacent to the Golden Nugget and Binion's Horseshoe. The Fremont Experience is a collection of gaming, restaurants, shopping and entertainment in Downtown Vegas, approx. two miles from the Strip. We had heard complaints about getting to and from the strip but honestly, the inexpensive bus ride is no more than ten minutes and most of that time is because of stops and rediculous traffic. No problem really. People will say that staying on the Strip is the thing to do but we didn't mind the back and forth travel. In fact many people we talked to on the Strip never made it Downtown, so we felt we got the best of both worlds. ACCOMODATIONS: The Four Queens is definitely \"old-school\" Vegas. We stayed in a standard room on a high level floor. The room was seemingly stuck in 70's decor but it was clean and not tiny. The ceiling in the shower had a tinge of rust, which I didn't care about but my girlfriend was not pleased. Our view was relatively bland, however, the mountains in the distance were beautiful. Because we spent very little actual time in the room, I can't tell you what room service is like. I can tell you the restaurant in the casino is good. And for that matter the casino itself was cool. (A lot of people we talked to at the tables and slots were staying at other hotels) Overall, I have nothing bad to say about the room, staff or casino. In fact, we when I broke down the price of the package, our nightly rate for hotel was approx. $16!! Can you really go wrong? And furthermore, what would you expect? WHAT ELSE: The Four Queens was nothing spectacular but it was not bad at all. When you visit the hotels on the Strip you will be blown away at the lavish designs and over-the-top construction. Beautiful giants such as the Bellaggio, Mandalay Bay and Ceasar's Palace are so plush, places like the Four Queens appear drab and pathetic. Still, because the location was downtown away from the madness of the Strip, the Four Queens is a reasonable, low-maintenance option for those who are the chill, low-maitenance type.", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities, MN", "Title": "\u201cThumbs down to the casino staff.\u201d", "Author": "knagl", "ReviewID": "UR3099036", "Content": "I did not stay in this hotel, but I did visit its casino on the night I ventured downtown. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, and I will not return to the casino or the hotel again. A slot machine malfunctioned. I was attempting to press the \"select lines\" button on the screen, but the touchscreen was mis-aligned, and pressing the \"select lines\" button actually equated to a press of the \"Max Bet\" button -- something I most certainly didn't want to do. I immediately stopped and had a friend watch my machine while I attempted to located a slot attendant. Not seeing one, I asked the nearest employee - a security guard. \"Excuse me -- are there any slot attendants floating around here?\" He replied rather gruffly, \"I don't know.\" I, now peeved, replied, \"Do you work here?\" He replied, \"Yeah, but not in that department.\" Thanks, buddy. I walked to a different part of the casino and located a slot attendant. She walked over to the machine, I explained the problem, and then she pressed the \"select lines\" button -- the exact same thing happened -- another (unwanted) max bet (now I'm down two max bets on this machine that I was attempting to just play down a couple of credits and cash out with). After a minute, she called her supervisor over. The supervisor came over, but didn't understand what the problem was. She then insisted that I was playing the game wrong and that the machine in fact was not malfunctioning. I even explained that her co-worker had witnessed (and caused) the machine to again malfunction because of the faulty touchscreen -- she didn't understand (or care), and proceeded to press buttons and spin the reels. She finally assured me that I would get my credits back, but because of her lack of understanding the situation, she wound up short-paying me by six credits, despite the fact that I kept insisting the exact amount that I had. As I cashed out at the cage, I asked if there was a business card available for the casino manager. The cashier (the friendliest person I encountered the whole time) was very apologetic and asked if she could help me with anything. I explained the situation, and she said she'd call the slot manager over. The slot manager came over, I got partway through my explanation of what happened when the original supervisor came over. He stopped listening to me and asked her a few questions (to which she basically said, 'he had a problem with the machine and I paid him), asked me exactly what the problem was, to which I replied, \"Your machine malfunctioned -- the touchscreen is mis-aligned. She didn't understand or didn't care to understand what the problem was, told me I was playing the machine incorrectly, and then shorted me money paying me.\" Once he understood that I was shorted, he offered to pay me the six credits, but at that point I was so sick of the ordeal (and wanted to prove a point) that I told him to please keep the money and just fix the problems (the machine and the staffer). He told me he would, and I left. ...and that is why I will not visit the Four Queens again, and encourage other people to visit one of the many other fine hotels/casinos in Las Vegas.", "Date": "January 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cVery Good!!\u201d", "Author": "jungle", "ReviewID": "UR3021497", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Four Queens..very qiuick and efficient. check-in...excellent room, although the bathroom was very small...had to close the door to get into the shower or bath....large room with a great view (1433)..housekeeping very good...excellent casino with all the new slots...food very good...the only problem I had was the bell desk...both times the guy didn't seem to want to get out of his chair to check or retrieve luggage or let me know where the airport shuttle would be picking up......grunted a little ..was sorry later that I had tipped him...", "Date": "January 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome affordable whirlpool rooms\u201d", "Author": "brendelb", "ReviewID": "UR3015782", "Content": "For someone looking for a reasonably priced hotel, try the 4 Queens in the downtown.

I will continue to gamble at the Four Queens, but I'll go elsewhere to sleep.", "Date": "April 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cJust Got Back from Vegas...\u201d", "Author": "dellis31", "ReviewID": "UR1520185", "Content": "Had a great time on Freemont Street. Nice place to stay. Didn't care for the rooms or staff at the Four Queens (rude and not helpful with directions or questions, and the rooms were kinda shabby). The cashiers were very nice... maybe they should work the front counter!

She gave me the wrong amount of money even though the money counter machine displayed the correct amount. When I confronted her, she said oh yeah and gave me the right money. I feel she was trying to cheat me and if I didn't catch the mistake, she would have pocketed my money. I spoke to the manager in charge and of course he defended her saying she couldn't have kept my money. The cashier's cage has cameras all around, etc. etc. As he walked away from me, I noticed he went over to her and said something. I have never never experienced that situation in a casino before.", "Date": "December 11, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Queens Hotel and Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d91816-Reviews-Four_Queens_Hotel_and_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$35 - $97*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">202 Fremont Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "91816", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4a/e1/4ae1a3def15ea3985b197c3a03e41a7f6large.jpg"}}

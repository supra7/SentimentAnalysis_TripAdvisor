It was across from the elevator. We asked for another room away from the elevator, and Steve said that they didn't have another suite, and since we booked through Hotels.com, he couldn't get us any different room. Understandable. Problem 1: The shower sets off the fire alarm. After an average-heat, average-length shower made ours go crazy. Problem is that it wouldn't go off. We called Steve downstairs, he came up (alarm still sounding), and took it to find a battery. A few minutes later, he returned, and the fire alarm was fine. Conclusion- You MUST shower with the door closed, or the steam sets off the alarm. Inconvenient at 11pm, for probably the whole floor of the hotel. That night: The hotel is near numerous gentleman's clubs. \"The Men's Club\" parking lot is diagonal from the rear of the hotel (also, a boarded up building), and was our suite view. Sometime after the shower incident, we heard what sounded like fireworks. Strangely similar to a single gunshot. Definately creepy, but not much we could do, except be thankful we were on the second floor. Next morning: Cockroach in toilet. Probably had fallen out of the air vent right above the toilet. Made the room feel GROSS, but we couldn't get another room. Not sure how this became the #2 hotel on TripAdvisor. The price wasn't special...

Courteous - Outstanding, accommodating staff made us feel our business was really appreciated. 3. Comfortable - Uncomfortable beds is a frequent complaint when we stay at hotels. Well, not this time! We have owned Select Comfort Sleep Number beds for years and have found them to be very comfortable. So, we were pleasantly surprised, that though not a Sleep Number, the bed in our room rivaled our Sleep Number for a good restful sleep! In addition, the bed linens were clean and smelled fresh! 4. Convenient - Centrally located off W Northwest Hwy, one can readily access the city's major thoroughfares for ease of travel. 5. Cost Conscious - This place is a bargain with it's affordable rates.

In the morning when we got up to have breakfast before we left, the same girl was still at the desk and was just a pleasant. She was also the one that had set up the breakfast for the guest and she really does a great job. Probably deserves a big raise. We were waiting for our shuttle time and what we thought was the manager, turns out it was the owner, asks if we were ready for our ride. I said yes and asked if he drove the shuttle as well and he said he did. When we walked out, our shuttle was the owner's own car, which was a very nice German car (no names). I asked if this was the shuttle and he said they have a van but since it was just my wife and I he prefered to take his car. This is personal service at it's finest.

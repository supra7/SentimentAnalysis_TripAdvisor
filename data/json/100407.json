The reason our review title is \"Overpriced\" is because the $149 didn't include a complimentary breakfast. They wanted $10.00 for a buffet.

On our way to the hotel about an hour before checking in, we phoned to make sure they got the note. They said they did see that in the computer and that it was all set. Upon checking in, again we confirmed (as there was no mention of it by the staff at this point) and the gentleman at the front desk said \"Oh, well, there's a note in the computer but it isn't in a place where we would notice it.\" Tired from driving since 6AM, all I really wanted was to wash up and take a nap, but now I would have to delay that to wait for housekeeping to come change my bedding. The room smelled like diesel fumes, but I was so tired I figured I was overreacting. After they changed out my bedding I went into the bathroom to wash my face and hands prior to settling in. The hot water never came. Again I called down to the front desk and two of their engineers came in and turned on the water and let it run for about twenty minutes before it was hot. At least it got hot. The shower curtain rod was about to fall off the wall, there was orange and black mildew hanging out with it's soap scum buddies, and the toilet looked like the inside had never seen bleach ever. The pseudo sleep number bed was either too hard or too soft, the AC was either too hot or too cold, and I was choking on the diesel exhaust smell so badly that after my nap I went to a nearby Target for air freshener.

Beautiful view of the parking lot and plenty of drunk people walking up and down the hallways at all hours (since this is such a classy joint).

The whole Eastern Seaboard got hit by a heat wave, therefore, I can honestly report that the A/C in the hotel is excellent. However, the water in the small swimming pool was freezing cold, i suspect that the staff must have turned off the water heater in view of the heat outdoor. the hotel is very clean even it is merely the Garden Inn. the decor in hotel lobby has a bit of the southern charm as in most of the Disney hotel lobbies in Orlando. I like the idea of having a coffee/tea stand in the lobby where one can freely serve ice cold water with lemon slices which is refreshing in the hot weather; coffee and tea. Cookies are also available from 5pm on. It is a nice touch. We had a great promotional deal form Hotels which offered us $90/night with breakfast included. Unfortunately, the Hotel.com staff was too helpful who indicated that i was overcharged for 5 nights as the system had doubled charged in taxes when i registered online and discovered that i was charged more than 20% taxes, as a result, the Hotels staff indicated that she could adjust the database to indicate there was only one adult staying in the room to offset the double charged tax (i could not understand why she did what she did). Well, this had led to some undesirable consequences which i will describe in the following, so if anyone stumbles into the special that i have had, please beware. As i checked in to the hotel late at night after the 400 mile journey, i was greeted by the receptionist, who indicated to me that the special offered to me must have been a mistake as the buffet breakfast could not have been included in my price. I responded calmly that i had the print out of the Hotels.com that stated that the breakfast was included despite the room charge was $90 (the regular was $160). The receptionist said that the discount code in the Hotels print out was foreign to her, as a result, she recommended me to call Hotels which should then contact Hilton and it would be likely that Hotels would have to pay for our breakfast so they could honour the deal offered to me. All was cool, i contacted the Hotels help line and i was informed by Hotels that the matter was straightened out after 10 minutes of my waiting on the phone. I was instructed to go up to the reception desk to receive my breakfast vouchers. On the following morning, i went up to the front desk to inquire about the vouchers and ensure that there would be no further issue regarding our stay in the hotel. The hotel manager greeted me and indicated that i had a terrific deal with Hilton and that the special code in Hotels print out was indeed a new promotional campaign code, and that the breakfast would and should be included. However, the registration indicated that there was only one person staying in the room, therefore, Hilton would honour the deal by offering us one free breakfast meal despite Hilton realized that we were a party of three. I did not want to make this into a real issue. I expressed my appreciation of prompt service and i left it at that. The truth was that someone in the administration must have made a mistake and the Hilton Garden Inn had to honour the offer, but they would use any means to ensure that they would not have a losing proposition. In view of our stay is definitely very inexpensive, i really did not want to pursue this matter. We enjoyed our stay in Hilton, and we had even extended our stay there by another night. The manager gladly made the same offer to us as the other nights stay which we greatly appreciated. Staying in Hilton in White Marsh was a great choice, for we wanted to visit DC for a few days. All the hotels in the vicinity of DC were charging over $200 a night, therefore, driving a mere distance of an hour or less from White Marsh but saving at least $75-$100 minimum in hotel expenses was a very economical way for us to visit DC but with a very fine hotel accommodation. the buffet breakfast in the hotel could add up if there are multiple persons in a family, but one can easily have excellent croissant, bagels with lox and cream cheese, or above average continental breakfast nearby in Panera (i think this is how you spell it).

It's about a half hour drive from the airport, a half hour drive from downtown Baltimore. A friend and I stayed there for a wedding. Upon arriving the first night, we thought we had gotten in too late to get a bite from the hotel restaurant. Although they were just about to close up, they took our order and kept the kitchen open a little later to accommodate us. My friend forgot her toothbrush, and the front desk supplied her with a new one free of charge. And the next morning, when I asked if there was a dry cleaner nearby (we needed to get our bridesmaids' dresses pressed), they told us to drop them off at the front desk for the hotel's dry cleaning service; they were pressed and hanging in our room closet just a few hours later (and for a very affordable fee). There's also free parking, which was a boon for us. And the rooms were squeaky clean and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the Baltimore area.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for Baltimore\u201d", "Author": "Travel2Uk", "ReviewID": "UR7804601", "Content": "We are from the UK and have stayed in several American chains but hadn't tried this one until now.

Upon entering you find yourself in a huge vaulted club house with two living room areas separated by a see through fireplace. Beautiful furniture, soaring cielings, and glass everywhere. However, the night I arrived it was empty probably because it was exceedingly hot. On the other side is what looks like a modern diner, with booths and tables. In the back is a small bar (which seemed to be full of the waitstaff's friends), the breakfast buffet area, a mini convenience store, and the front desk. Front desk staff were below average, a kind of fake friendly I would gladly exchange for quick, efficient, good customer service. They were quite slow, and even made customers wait while they took phone calls, etc. Three types of coffee and fruit are available gratis. Rooms are beautiful, full of lots of small touches: a microwave and fridge in a kitchen cabinet setup, comfy armchair with ottoman, huge window, huge desk with super comfy chair, and a curved shower curtain. The business center was small and in use during my stay, even at 10 pm. The pool was decent sized, but closed at 9:30, not the posted 10 pm. There was a staffer watching tv in the workout room, but it was adequate. Parking was ample and close. I did not hear my neighbors, although I did hear the traffic from I-95. Take earplugs if you are sensitive. Excellent view. Room service was superb and some items reasonable. There are many stores and restaurants very close by. It is a beautiful, but very crowded area. This hotel is beautiful, new, full of classy touches that make its pricetag and lack of a free breakfast worth while. With better staff and management, this place would be superb.

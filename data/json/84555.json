My wife and I were staying in the area due to some meetings and did not want to commute. We stopped by at about 2:00PM and did a quick check-in. During check-in I asked for a place to eat and the desk clerk gave me directions to where she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153were lots of restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I went up to the room and when I opened the door, I was almost knocked over by the smell. It smelled like a combination of mold and wet carpet. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to change rooms at that point and opened the window to air the room out. I then set off to find the restaurants and found the directions lacking badly (she had said turn left on the street, but pointed right). One direction ended up in a residential area on a dead end and we drove for about 2 miles in the other direction only to find two restaurants, neither which appealed to us. We returned to the room at about 6:30 only to find the smell still there (while not as bad, I still had to take an antihistamine) and that there were no other rooms. There was a new desk clerk on and when we asked her about a possible restaurant within walking distance (we were afraid to move the car as we had a very early appointment and could not get blocked in), she sent us to Subway! When we started walking down the street, we discovered a wonderful Thai restaurant almost directly across from the hotel. After a great dinner, we returned to the room. During our stay, I made the following observations: Staff: Clueless and two seamed more intent on talking with a friend than waiting on guests. Bed: OK, but sheets were rough and full of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pills\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Room: Small, reminded me of a European hotel Noise: There is a great amount of noise from people walking by outside. Also if anyone within a couple of rooms used the shower or toilet, it sounded as if they were in your room. This of course got better after about midnight. Shower: Great shower head, nice soaps, soft towels Parking: Terrible, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there early it is very easy to get your car blocked in by other vehicles. Food: did not get a chance to try due to early check-out I doubt we will return.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cclean, well run hotel\u201d", "Author": "janet w", "ReviewID": "UR123699228", "Content": "great value, great service, very helpful staff, especially Juan-Carlos at front desk. perfect for our stay as a family in LA, connecting rooms and confortable beds.

No swimming pool but there is a hot tub and thick matresses on the sun loungers. We used the blue and orange line buses to go to the Farmers Market and the Berverley Shopping Center. We caught the Orange 220 bus from the Beverly Centre and it stopped outside the Hotel. Heavy traffic on Robertson Blvd which we overlooked but was not intrusive and did not keep us awake. Good selectio of hot and cold breakfast - pity about the plastic cuttlery.

The spotless bathroom sports granite countertops and was always stocked with fresh towels (to my chagrin). The maid did replace towels every day, even when they were hung, as instructed, to be reused. The coffee maker was located on a shelf in the bathroom (in an alcove, away from the toilet), which I did find somewhat odd, but, then, I don't drink coffee, so it was not a problem for me. If I did have a complaint, it would be that the sink is in a strange location in relation to the toilet (see photo) - but, really, that is just being picky. The personnel at the hotel were all pleasant. The attendants at the front desk were always for advice and directions. Our room was straightened every day. Our free breakfast was always stocked, warm and fresh. Speaking of breakfast, this was not just cold cereal and pasteries - though they were there, too - BWCI had fresh scrambled eggs, cheese mini omlettes, waffles, toast, fruit, cheese and bacon. Definitely some healthy choices there. All in all I would say this is a great little hotel. Free Wifi. The neighborhood is nice and feels safe, I walked the 1/2 mile down to Wilshire for work every morning and evening.

We booked in here for four nights, on the basis of a lot of positive Trip Advisor recommendations. Three words: very sorely disappointed. We arrived (after a twelve hour flight) to find Mr Surly on the desk -- in about the shabbiest and least welcoming hotel reception area we've ever seen. Our room smelt stale (and had someone been smoking here recently?). The sheets on the bed were elderly, unironed, and seemed damp. The room was chill on an unseasonably cold night: but there were no instructions for operating the heating. We eventually discovered by trial and error that if you waited four or five noisy minutes as the system blew out cold air, it would eventually warm up (though the unheated bathroom was always cold). Breakfast the next morning was in a shabby room seemingly last decorated two or three decades ago. The cutlery was plastic, for heaven's sake, and the plates and cups paper. The food was basic and of very cheap quality, the choice minimal. This really was pretty depressing: not a good way to start the day. The hotel has no lounge or public area -- apart from the outdoor patio area which is obviously no use when it is raining and/or chilly. The morning receptionist was friendly and helpful, organising us taxis and giving us some information about places to eat (though in the end we didn't venture out at night as the immediate environs are pretty unpleasant). The room seemed to get cleaned adequately. But this is certainly not at all the place to choose for a relaxing stay. (I should add -- but this is a general point, not a particular reflection on this hotel -- that LA distances between places you might want to go are further than a careless glance at maps might suggest.

Our room was gorgeous, with lush comfy beds, bathrobes, luxury bath items, free internet, room service available, and a stellar view of the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign. We loved the courtyard and the way the rooms surroundied it, and although the hot tub looked inviting, we never had a chance to try it out. : ( This place is a little off the beaten path from many of the hot spots of the area, but I didn't feel unsafe in the neighborhood. Both an Orthodox temple and a Kaballah center were across the street and the streets surrounding were residential, with a major business street just a couple of blocks down. It's a bit of a stretch to say it's in Beverly Hills, but it might be on the VERY outskirts. It is a short drive to many places: Farmer's Market, Hollywood, Beverly Hills hotspots and Melrose Avenue and Robertson Blvd., shopping. After going out and having fun shopping on Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Centre, we returned to find no parking available in the hotel's lot. We inquired at the front desk and THEN we were informed that there was an additional underground lot! OH!!! That's was so much better and so much more roomy!

It's a small boutique style hotel that we felt was very reasonably priced at about 150 before tax a night. I must say that I did read reviews before booking and was very afraid of not having a reservation, so I called about 3 times to confirm that everything was ok, and it was. It could be that we booked it directly with the hotel? Anyhow, the rates we found booking directly from the company were pretty much the same as hotels.com and other sites...we used AAA so it saved a few dollars. From the moment we walked in, until the moment we walked out, the front staff was really kind and courteous. There aren't a lot of staff (that we could see), but everything seemed very smoothly run, from the breakfast room to the room cleaning. As someone mentioned, it was comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located on Robertson, which is a pretty noisey street...I recommend requesting a room that has a window facing within the hotel. The location was a great, very short driving distance to places like The Grove, Santa Monica and Venice Beach, and Bev hills. We didn't walk anywhere around the hotel (didn't see much w/i walking distance), but there were some food places and a startbucks within a block. Parking in the hotel is not worth it, as people have complained about. But why pay $11 a day when street parking is *free* overnight? I believe it started from 6 pm until 8 am..plus on the side street by the hotel it was an additional 2 hours (so 10 am..or ahem, us girls slept in until 2 on one day and were ok)...so that's a great way to save a few bucks. The room we had was clean, and the beds were comfortable, twin size. The bathroom was ok..but it was the first time I had used a shower where the base of the shower connected to the bathroom floor....as in no tub. It's not like the shower water went anywhere else in the bathroom, so it was fine. One downfall was that the air conditioner would turn off after a certain somewhat short period of time. We would go to bed with the perfect temperature, then wake up sweating because it was off. I'm not sure if there was a timer on it, or if it was just not working properly? We didn't get a chance to find out. If you notice it giving you the same problem after one night, then check with the front desk about having it fixed. Breakfast at the hotel was great. We made sure to book a hotel with a full breakfast as to save time and eat well...I'm a breakfast fanatic. so it was a really good value to me to save the time and money. One day we made it 5 minutes before breakfast closed and the kitchen lady was sooo kind enough to make us 3 waffle batters without us asking. There were some lounge chairs and a mini courtyard in the hotel, so it was nice to eat breakfast outside while it was a little warm.

We received a confirmation via e-mail, with a confirmation number. We received an e-mail prior to arriving, saying that 'they' were looking forward to our visit. When we arrived (4:00 p.m. on the scheduled day), we were told that they had no record of our reservation, could not locate the reservation number, and had no rooms available. The receptionist did offer us one night free in a sister property (in Santa Monica, not at all near the area of the city where we had wanted to stay). We checked on-line and the reviews were extremely poor. We declined the offer, and made our own arrangements for another hotel elsewhere in the city. The receptionist then offered us three Best Western 'gift cards', each for $50 off a stay at a Best Western. Upon examining the cards, however, they each expired in 1/08. (This was March 2008.) Two of the cards, the receptionist (or someone) had used a black marker to cross out the expiration date. I can really see using one of these cards at some Best Western, and explaining that I was not the person who crossed out the expiration date; that the cards should actually still be accepted! I told the receptionist that I wanted a statement, on the Inn's letterhead, indicating that we had arrived on schedule but there was no reserved room for us, and that we would not later be charged for not showing up at the Inn as per our reservation. The receptionist at first refused, saying that he could not do this. He said that of course we would not be charged. I noted that I had no reason, based on my current experience, to believe him. He offered to call his general manager. I said that was fine; that he could explain to the manager that there were two women there who would not leave without this letter. He then apparently decided that he could provide this letter without calling the general manager. However, the first letter was not on letterhead. The next two times my name was spelled wrong (despite clearly printing my name in two-inch-high letters after the first time). I finally was given the requested letter. While we were trying to make reservations elsewhere, a man came in to check in; from what I overheard, he had booked a room with two double beds. He was being given a room with one king. He was traveling with a friend, not a bed companion. When the man questioned this arrangement, he was told that they could provide a \"roll-away\" (i.e., a cot). He eventually agreed, but asked if they could transfer him to the requested double room the next night. Good luck to him. I can't tell you anything about the rooms, the ambiance, etc. The lobby looked clean. Oh, and after I arrived home, there was another e-mail from the Carlyle Inn, saying that they appreciate our business and hoped that we enjoyed our stay. If you want to try staying here, good luck.

The only downside to the room was that the heat/ac fan was a little noisy. But the fan was off most of the time. All rooms open to the courtyard, and traffic noise tends to echo from the rather busy street. However, at night our room was quiet, except for an occasional fire truck. In good weather the courtyard would be a pleasant place to pass some time. The restaurant is only open for breakfast, and the breakfast is comparable to a Hampton Inn. The restaurant staff is excellent. There is free wireless internet, but you get nicked $10/day for parking. The chocolate chip cookies in the lobby are history. Since the hotel is small, the small front desk staff can get overwhelmed with check ins, answering the phone, handling car keys, etc. However, it is a problem of having a small staff, and not the staff members themselves, who are very accommodating.

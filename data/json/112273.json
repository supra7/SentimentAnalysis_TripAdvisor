This level of customer service is tough to find anywhere and it made our weekend a great one. All weekend long every single person working at the hotel treated us like gold.

My husband booked this trip for our family and chose this hotel based on the positive reviews he read. The 3 story hotel is located right on Pacific Beach. It literally takes you less than 3 minutes to get from your hotel room to the ocean. It was very low key and uncrowded; a boutique-type gem. Upon our afternoon arrival, we were told our room preference was not available. We booked through Expedia and were told our room preference was not guaranteed because of that. The staff worked immediately to remedy the situation and placed us in a king jr suite with a full ocean view for the first night and then moved us to the room preference we had originally booked with an upgraded view. Every staff member we encountered, from the front desk to the person who brought us extra pillows, were friendly, competent and eager to help. Great staff! The rooms were upgraded and very clean. All amenities were provided that you would expect from a high end hotel including large beach towels for our use. The beds were very comfortable and the decor lovely. My only complaint would have been the use of bedspreads as opposed to duvets. The entire hotel was very well maintained, including the pool and lounge area. The pool was an ok size, no frills, but very clean with comfortable chaise loungers with cushions. And of course with a spectacular view of the Ocean! For a small fee the hotel provides beach chairs and beach cruisers. Children's beach toys are free to use. The beach in front of the hotel was never over crowed and we always had a front row seat to some great surfing. Parking was also convenient located in an underground garage beneath the hotel. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel because we were off exploring the area each morning. Be sure to try Kono's Cafe just south of the hotel. We ate breakfast and lunch there a number of times during our stay. Great \"made from scratch\" food, big portions and cheap.

The room was awesome with King Room, jacuzzi tub,walk in shower,double vanities,seperate livingroom, kitchenette,dining table and 2 balconies! The views spectacular! The staff was very helpful and could not have been happier with their help. We used the hotels bikes every day for a lovely bike ride along the beach . We really enjoyed the pool area and also spend days on the beach across from the hotel. We never had breakfast at the hotel, just because we started our days with a long bike ride or walk and would end up having breakfast along the way. The Green Flash was our favourite - a 5min walk down from the hotel with glass patio overlooking the ocean,great for people watching while enjoying coffee and Blueberry Pancakes or Eggs Benni! The frontdesk staff organized a taxi for us every night to go for dinner in La Jolla, about a $13 drive. Do yourself a favour and try The Marine Room and Tapenade in La Jolla!amazing.

Now this is not a cheap hotel and was told that the rates used to be much better, but they still don't seem to have any trouble filling the rooms. The breakfast that they have each morning is a really good one! The breakfast bar gives you everything from dry cereal to omelets and waffles. They also offer fresh fruit, yogurt, muffins, toast, coffee,toast and juice. Something for everyone! You also get half off if you are in one of the upper range rooms. The pool area is beautiful with lots of greenery and is kept incredibly clean. The hottub is also very nice and a great place to go and meet other people. At night, the lights come on and you almost feel you are in Hawaii! Not to mention the sunsets you see from your balcony! They are very helpful in making dinner arrangements for you and can even give you VIP cards at various restaurants. (Thanks Katherine!) There is underground parking that is gated, so there is never a question of safety....no matter what time you are coming or going.

The hotel offer a turn down service in the evening with chocolates on the pillows and this was a really nice touch. The pool is nice, clean and a good size with views of the ocean. There is also a hot tub which stays open after the sun has gone down. There were lots of sun loungers and the pool area was really quite peaceful (we did stay out of season). The bar by the pool does happy hour from 4pm with 2 for 1 drinks and the friendly bartender made us some awesome frozen margaritas! Location is amazing, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be better! The hotel is right on the beach, with beautiful views and beach walks and walking distance to lots of nice restaurants and bars.

The rooms have 2 double beds which are amazingly comfortable once you manage to clamber onto them - the heavy wooden frames around them are just at the right height for me to bang my shins every time I attempted to get on the bed. The view of the ocean from the balcony is fabulous - we left the door open to fall asleep to the roar of the waves crashing against the beach. Our room was almost right in the centre of the hotel - which meant that we were over the top of the entrance to the pool - the balconies are great but they aren't very private or quiet - indeed when there are people in the pool, especially kids playing, it can be very noisy. Service was reasonable - but not exceptional. When we booked we had a rate with a free glass of wine which didn't ever materialise - although to be honest we kept forgetting to mention it. There were a couple of other niggles which irritated - they ran out of the only decent beer they had in the bar - Sam Adams (they only did four different beers, one of which was a \"lite\") and 2 days later when we tried again for a beer they still hadn't got any (the bartender was a bit embarrassed and offered to pop down the shop!). The other niggle was that we asked about a late checkout - it was a quiet time so they agreed to an hour later than normal - 12noon, but if we wanted a 3pm checkout we would have to pay just under $100. We settled for 12noon. Overall we really liked this hotel - its small and right beside the beach with a great view and we would probably go back if we ever return to San Diego.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cLong stay guest, and simply superb\u201d", "Author": "DJTravelBoy", "ReviewID": "UR123079187", "Content": "The location is fantastic with the ocean at your doorstep and long, beautiful walks a daily must.

Their full ocean view rooms have balconies that are basically on top of the ocean, and are AMAZING for people watching if you get a room on floor 2 or 3 on the right-hand side of the hotel. Try not to get a room right in the middle of the U shaped hotel, as those are farther back from the beach and you end up just spying on people in the pool when you should be enjoying the sunset. I never pay for parking, as I'm always able to find free parking within a few blocks. I also never eat the food at the hotel, as San Diego is chock-full of marvelous restaurants. My partner and I are honestly slightly embarrassed for liking this hotel so much. We're in our early 30s, which we think is far too early to be staying in a Tommy Bahama themed hotel. The upside of that is that there isn't a party scene at night. It's always quiet, we sleep with the balcony doors wide open, and when we venture down to the jacuzzi we always have it to ourselves. The one downside is the customer service. The hotel staff tends to be reluctant to allow early check-ins or late check-outs. They also won't let you book a specific room unless you pay a $50 fee -- so even if we book months in advance, we aren't guaranteed one of the right-hand side oceanfront rooms. Even though we are repeat customers! I also never get free upgrades, even when better rooms are available :-( My final gripe: my partner called today to find out about availability this coming Monday. He called at about 6pm and was given a special unadvertised rate by the person working the desk. He said he would call back in a bit to confirm. When he called back a different person answered the phone and refused to honor the rate he had been quoted just a few hours earlier, even though the room (a King Suite) was still available. We felt like we were being jerked around a bit, so we booked a \"Surf Pad\" room at a different beach-front hotel just a smidge down the boardwalk. We're bummed out, because that hotel is swankier, but also louder and douchier. That said, they are much more accommodating about early check-ins and they don't bait and switch on price.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Friendly Staff, Kids loved it!!\u201d", "Author": "Chris B", "ReviewID": "UR122843465", "Content": "I stayed 3 nights at the Pac Terrace with my wife and 2 small children (8,6) and we had a blast!

The views from the hotel were awesome! My favorite time of the day was at sunset. We would sit on the chairs by the pool and have a perfect view of the sunset. The service at the hotel was excellent. Everyone was friendly from the janitorial staff up to management. I thought that was very impressive. Even before we traveled to San Diego, I was contacted by the hotel concierge to find out if we had any needs for reservations at local restaurants or any local attractions. In advance, the hotel made us dinner reservations for some near-by places, and got us our San Diego Zoo tickets. This made things so convenient and easy for us. Our room was very nice and a good size. We stayed in on of the family suites. The pull-out couch was very comfortable. The view from our room was of the pool and the ocean. I think this was a perfect room for our family of 5. As far as food, the hotel only serves breakfast. We ate breakfast there 3 out of the 5 days. The food was pretty good, but the menu did not change daily while we were there. It was a buffet with things like eggs, omelettes, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast, pancakes, french toast, yogurt, bananas, a few rolls, and a couple of choices of cereal. We enjoyed it on the days we ate there. The coffee was Starbucks and was very good. The hotel concierge gave us 4 excellent recommendations for places to eat dinner. We enjoyed all the places they sent us to. Most of the places were within walking distance and we would walk there along the boardwalk each night to get there. The pool was nice and enjoyable for the kids, and they had a nice hot tub. The chairs were comfortable lounge chairs and they even set up tiki torch lights once the sun went down. The hotel really was a great choice for us and I would highly recommend it. The only drawback at all had nothing to do with the hotel itself, it was more the area where it is located. We found it was very interesting, but we had no problems with it. The boardwalk had some homeless people further down the road from the hotel and there were certaintly some very interesting characters we saw as we walked on the boardwalk. The hotel itself is very secure and we never felt unsafe. The area around the hotel is pretty casual with a lot of surfers around. It was fun to watch them surfing at high tide! We did not spend much time at the actual beach. The beach area is okay, but certaintly not like the white pristine beaches in the Carribean :). It is just a public beach in California. I knew that this was the case, but playing on the beach was not one of our priorities this vacation. I did see other families with their kids down on the beach playing. My kids seemed to prefer the beautiful pool at the hotel. Anyway, overall I would say the hotel exceeded our expectations. We were very happy with them and would recommend this hotel.

It's by far the best hotel in the area - Pacific Beach. The view onto the beach and the Pacific and the surfers is fantastic; as are the sunsets. Just as good is the level of service here - the quality,warmth, friendliness of every single team member is as good as i have ever know it in any hotel. The best room: The best rooms are on the second and third floors - avoid the first (ground) floor as it's onto the pool and not much of a view of the sea. The best rooms are on the edges of the hotel but they are the suites and I'm not sure they are worth the extra. You get a great sunset from all the ocean front rooms - it does not matter which one you are in. We were slightly to the side of the pool (on the second floor) which was good. Breakfast is really average and I would not bother with it - as one guest said: 'in other hotels this kind of breakfast is normally complimentary.' Go out. There is no restaurant in the hotel but that's fine as there are so many choices in walking distance - ask for the restaurant recommendation sheet they have in reception to find the better places. The hotel is not a trendy hotel - it's very functional but it won't win design awards! It's ideal for families. The secure garage parking, under the hotel, is $20 per day for residents, which is steep. There is free wifi which is of a good quality. I Which brings me to my main problem - the area - Pacific Beach itself. It's a surfer beach, popular with students, and the younger folks. It's NOT a top end resort at all. I guess, for California, it's a little bit of a dive. Trendy dive. So, for example, eating out is cheap and cheerful. There are loads of rowdy sports bars close by. Next time, i think I won't come back to this area (I'll go to La Jolla, see below) which is a shame because i liked the hotel. My advice is to research the area you stay in San Diego very carefully. Here's my very simple guide..... Most important to you is restaurants, busy and good bars and lots of choices. You don't mind not being by the sea.....GAS LAMP QUARTER DOWNTOWN You like being by the sea and like really loud and lively budget places with the trendy vibe....PACIFIC BEACH You want to be by the sea, will pay really premium prices and like it older and more conservative....LA JOLLA (you get the bonus of seeing seals every day on the rocks around La Jolla) In all 3, you'll need a car to get around and inland, into the forests, mountains and desert - all of which are 1.5 hrs drive from San Diego. Bye the way, San Diego is totally cool place - so definitely go. ps top tip - we went in late October and the 'coastal eddy' had started = fog, mist, cold (mid 60s). Simple... 3 days it was miserable on the coast, we drove 1.5 hrs into the mountains and then onto the desert and it was beautiful - totally cloudless blue skies and hot, hot, hot. Within 1.5 hours we went from 65 on the coast to 96 in the desert. I love the fact that that is always and option if you have fog/bad weather in San Diego.

The public areas are well kept and the staff is extremely friendly, always going out of their way to cordially greet you every time you pass by them. Although the pool is not huge, we enjoyed it. The hot tub was also nice. We were disappointed in our room. At $500 a night and all the glowing reviews (#2 in San Diego!), our expectations were high. The rooms are dark, cramped and cluttered with a lot of large clunky furniture that is not functional. There were no regular size drawers to put our clothes in, so we kept them in our suitcase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there was barely a place to set our open suitcase (that was out of the way). The bathroom vanity was so cluttered with stuff that there was no room for our stuff. The caulk and tile in the bath and shower area was dirty and installed poorly. I recall seeing a previous review that said something like: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153think Best Western with wood trim.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I think that pretty much sums up the quality and style of the rooms.

However, the precooked breakfast is of mediocre quality (e.g., dry toast, hard waffles). They have the staff on hand and the facility to cook eggs made to order, which would be a great addition. If the breakfast were fully included, it would be harder to complain. But it goes back to the value issue: since we were paying extra for it, we were expecting a bit more.

The views get better as you go up and the view from the ground floor is hardly 'ocean view', more pool view. We didn't encounter any of the noise that some reviews mentioned - we slept with the balcaony doors open and all we could hear was the ocean. Our one issue was over service at breakfast. This hotel is not cheap so if what follows sounds picky it's because we're judging it against similarly price hotels. We stayed for 4 days and: On 2 days the coffee ran out On 1 day the OJ ran out On 3 days they were incredibly slow to clear tables - far slower than just about anyway I can remember. This results in a pigeon problem if you are eating outside and you have the 'pleasure' or pigeons eating left-overs on neraby tables. All these were attended to when we asked but you just shouldn't have to point this out to staff. Don't get me wrong - this is a very nice hotel in a great location but there is a risk they are living off their location and not attending to some of the basics For UK visitors who may be thinking of staying at the LA beaches, go to San Diego instead.

Prior to our arrival we requested two cribs for the twins and were promptly assured that two pack-n-play would be waiting for us in our room upon check-in. The cribs weren't there when we arrived, but a visit to the front desk fixed that. The 2-room suite is not terribly large, calling it a \"family\" suite is a bit of a stretch. The living / dining room has a pullout sofa bed with a comfortable but somewhat complicated air inflatable mattress (electric pump is in the closet), and no direct access to either patio or bathroom, remember that if you like to watch TV late at night while other family members are sleeping next door. The \\bedroom has two very comfortable queen beds and a small work desk, but not enough room for the cribs, so we ended up leaving those in the living room and our older daughter slept with us on the second queen bed since the cribs took all the room in front of the sofa bed, no big deal but we were hoping for some extra room in a family suite, honestly. Some nice touches in the room: a power strip with plenty of available outlets for phones and laptops by the desk, an iHome radio on the nightstand, an available refrigerator in addition to the minibar fridge for the babies' milk and stuff, two big, high quality flat screen TVs and DVD players, Tommy Bahamas toiletries, four big pool towels - but make sure you bring them back with you to the room or they will charge you for the missing ones. Not so nice: somewhat dated furniture and carpets, a bathtub with an anemic shower head (in a suite at this price we expected separate shower stall and tub), poor wi-fi coverage. We were on the first floor (suite 105) and could barely get a signal, or none at all, depending of where we sat. I hate that. Service was spotty: Very friendly staff, but we left the room at 10 am the second day and when we came back at 2 pm for our girlls' afternoon nap, the room had not been done yet. We called and scheduled it for 6 pm, housekeeping did come while we were out for dinner but must have been in a rush as they forgot a bunch of cleaning supplies and dirty rags in our bathroom. My wife and daughters had no complaints about the pool, service staff was attentive and friendly everywhere else. We ate breakfast in the room, much easier with little kids... The $20 daily \"valet park\" fee should be eliminated, though. First of all, the valet attendant is almost never there and it is really way faster to self park, it's a small hotel. Also, 500 bucks for a room and you want and extra $20 to park my car, seriously? Finally, a couple of hours after checking out someone called my cell and left a message saying that housekeeping could \"smell some strong smoke odor\" in my room and I would be assessed a $250 fee, bye bye. WHAT? We don't smoke and, if we did with 3 small kids in our room, we should probably be in jail, lol! I called them and, after putting me on hold for a while, a manager came back on the phone to tell me the fee would be waived... She never explained why I was assessed the fee to begin with, a mistake perhaps? I don't care either way, but I can't help but thinking that, had I not called right away to complain, that fee would have stuck. Everyone makes mistakes, but before you accuse someone of smoking in a $500/night non-smoking room you better make 100% sure you know what you are talking about. Finally, the location: It's great as long as you concentrate on the ocean in front of you: Unbeatable views, breezes and walks on the beach just steps away, really gorgeous. The area around the hotel, on the other hand, is definitely forgettable. It's fine to hang out during the day but I would not feel safe walking around at night with small kids. We didn't, we took the car to go eat since the hotel has no restaurant. Lots of beach dives, taco stands and fairly seedy pubs, rowdy kids in a party mood (it's the end of summer, maybe that had something to do with it) and the occasional homeless sleeping on a bench, Pacific Beach is not very family friendly in my opinion.

Walking is the best way to get around because there is no other place to park your car other than the hotel. It costs $20 per day to park and the parking garage was well lit and convenient - definitely worth it, considering the lack of parking in the area. There were a lot of people partying at clubs/condos/restaurants along the boardwalk; so if that offends you, you might want to pick another beach. We saw plenty of families along the boardwalk too. The Pacific Terrace Hotel is on the north end of the boardwalk, so it doesn't get the same foot traffic and noise as its neighbors to the south. The hotel loaned us boogie boards, beach chairs, and beach towels at no charge which was a nice benefit. This location was convenient to our trip to Torrey Pines State Park and La Jolla.

We were so thankful that we even got the same exact room we had 2 years ago,,,a King Jr Suite. We are a family of 4 that includes twin 9 year olds. I felt that the room was clean and well maintained. We loved that we had access to beach toys, chairs and an umbrella. The umbrella was a huge benefit to me as we are all extremely fair skinned and burn easily as a result. The room had a breakfast bar area with refrigerator and microwave (plus a mini bar which we never used). There was a sofa sleeper that was a little larger than twin bed size which was great for the kids. The room was a great size and arrangement for us where we could have access to our own snacks and make a lunch or dinner for the times we wanted to save a little money,,,or too tired to go out. The \"kitchen\" area was stocked with plates, glasses and utensils. It was on the first floor with a patio that opened out to the pool area. It is the only room I've stayed in that had enough trash cans! I thought the hotel was fairly quiet. We are not picky about things like that. My kids are usually the ones making the noise. There was a workout room that I meant to visit but never did and also a computer available. There are even books available to read which was great for me because I forgot to bring one. The hotel is right off the beach. It is exactly what my daughters loved,,,,alternating between the pool and the beach. It was so easy for us with it being on the first floor. Access to the hotel and pool is secure. We always felt safe and it was not over-run with people at the pool or the breakfast buffet. Surf lessons are offered up and down the beach. The boardwalk was great for exercise. We meant to rent bikes but never got around to it. It was a great and lazy vacation,,,,just what we were looking for. We didn't need the big resorts with the fancy pools. My daughters (age 9) were perfectly happy with the pool and beach. We met another family that had been coming there for 25 years and staying in the same room. Everyone we met was really nice. I feel like they kept up the clientele so we were never concerned with the other guests. Everyone was quiet and respectful of privacy. The breakfast buffet was simple but just what we wanted. There was a great breakfast place down the beach a short walk,,,,Konos,,,the portions were huge. Yes, hotel parking is $20 per day,,,as it is for most nice hotels on the beach. There was a lot of kelp on the beach and I did read up on that situation about the kelp washing ashore and that it is best for the environment for it to be left there. It was interesting and I recommend reading up on the subject. It certainly didn't slow us down or impact us one way or the other. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Housekeeping did a great job. A few times, we left in the morning and stopped back at the room fairly early, like 12:30, and the room would already have been cleaned. I stayed in a partial ocean view room for 6 nights at $420 a night. I didn't know it came with a kitchenette, so that was a nice surprise. It had a small frig, microwave, coffeemaker, sink, and plates, bowls, and utensils. It came in handy. The balcony overlooked the ocean on the left and directly underneath and to the right was grass and a view of another building. The Pacific Beach area can be noisy at night. I left the patio door open to hear the ocean overnight. Drunken carousers screaming below at like 3 am woke me up the first night. I came to San Diego for comic con, and the hotel was close to everything I wanted to see. I don't think it took longer than 10 minutes to drive to the convention center, the zoo, Sea World, La Jolla, etc. There are also a lot of restaurants you can walk to from the hotel within a few blocks. There's a Trader Joe's a couple blocks away as well, so you can buy drinks, etc. to bring to the zoo or the other attractions that want to charge you an insane amount for a snack or bottle of water. Parking isn't too bad if you don't mind sometimes having to walk a block or two. There is a garage at the hotel that is $20 a night, but we just parked on the street, and it was fine. It's well marked where you can park and can't, mostly only signs for street cleaning (no parking first Wed. of the month sort of thing). The staff was really nice about answering questions about getting around and parking and didn't push us to pay for the garage, which is what I expected. They provide a lot of nice little touches which I appreciated: free iced tea and cookies, 4 beach towels in your room, HBO, everyone on staff makes a point of saying hello. The only thing I can come up with negative is that they were doing construction on the pool area, so I didn't get a chance to use it. But it wasn't a big deal, since the beach is right there. Also it would have been nice if there was another entrace other than the lobby. It was quite a hike to get to my room each time on the other side of the building. Usually they have a back door you can stick your keycard in, but I never saw one.

We were on ground level and right next to the pool and hot tub. Easily walked out the locked gate to the beach path for walks. Further south and into Mission Beach for this busy holiday weekend was frat house like, but at Pacific Terrace it was family friendly. We had our bikes on our car and the hotel had bike racks in the locked underground parking just waiting for us! We rode our bikes along the beach path from the hotel all the way to the south end of Mission Beach and around to the bay side and back up (more than once). The area through Mission Beach was a party crowd July 4th weekend, and pretty crowded. On the second trip we found the alley just behind the first row of houses and that sped things up. We ate at The Green Flash and it was just fair. We rode our bikes all the way to Luigi's on the Beach for some good pizza and very nice San Diego micro brews.

The good news is that it lived up to its promise. The staff was more than friendly, the room was very comfortable and the location was ideal. A small reason behind our choosing this hotel was because they rented bikes on the property. We were briefly disappointed when we learned they were out of bikes when we checked at the front desk around noon. However, we were pleased when Rachel at the front desk directed us to a rental company just a couple blocks down the beach where we were able to rent for an even lower price than the hotel offered, thanks to a coupon she gave us. We didn't mind the walk to the rental location since we were already planning a long ride and a little warm-up walk wouldn't hurt. At the bike rental place, we were on our way in under 5 minutes. We also got a recommendation from Paul for a Mexican restaurant in Old Town, plus a coupon for a free appetizer. The food was great! On the downside, just minor points. There were lipstick marks on one of the glasses in our room, but otherwise the room was impeccable. Don't expect much from the excercise room. We checked it out, but decided against it. Choose a long bike ride if you want to get in some exercise. The pool was nice and but most lounge chairs were taken when we chose to visit around happy hour. However, we had a room on the first floor that was just steps from the pool and were happy when they brought our drink order to our patio where we were taking in the view. The pool water was bath water warm. Overall, we'd definitely return.

The room was clean and odor free (we're particular) and the accommodations were as promised. The front desk & staff were exceptionally friendly and professional. We ate breakfast there only once, and were pleased. Parking is below ground with safe, easy access to the upper floors via elevator. It was a bit chilly, so the pool & hot tub were only used once, but were very well maintained. Plenty of chairs, towels, etc. I would recommend a windbreaker or fleece this time of year, but layer! Chilly in the morning leads to some NICE warm afternoons. DON'T FORGET THE SUNSCREEN!! You'll need it! The beach is nice with lots of sunning & swimming to the south and the start of some rocky cliffs to the north...all within walking distance. If you like (or want to try) surfing, this is the place to be. Downtown San Diego is a short, easy drive, as well as some nice scenery to the north in La Jolla & Del Mar. Bring your cameras... the sunsets are INCREDIBLE. The walkway behind the hotel is great and is a nice way to head south down the beach without having to utilize the busy street/sidewalk. There are PLENTY of great restaurants & bars (most are family friendly) within walking distance, as well as a grocery store to stock up on drinks & munchies. (Our room had a small fridge that we stocked with drinks & things). We loved the laid back atmosphere and the locals were very friendly. The bar areas got a little rowdy after dark, but noting crazy, just sort of a college-type atmosphere. Don't be surprised by the amount of street bums. They re there, but they do not aggressively badger you for money. I know everyone does the zoo or Sea World, but we chose the Adventure R.I.B. rides, located in the marina behind the Sheraton across from the airport in San Diego. They offer whale & dolphin sightseeing trips as well as harbor trips and an excursion to the Mexican Coronado Islands, which is what we did. FANTASTIC!!!

It seemed promising at first. The room was ample but I question the \"newly redecorated\" part. Everything felt (and looked) very late-90s to me. The staff were friendly and responsive, but we had a bunch of minor problems that sort of added up. Our thermostat didn't work, the pbs station on the tv didn't work (and that's all our kids watch!), the dvd player didn't work, and our room was missing a trash can. Very responsive fixes to most of these problems but the pbs never got fixed---we were told it was a LodgeNet issue). The location is a little odd....there appeared to be a mobile soup kitchen a couple of evenings right outside our window which drew a colorful crowd. I never felt my safety was threatened, but it was not exactly a neighborhood feel. Skip the breakfast...many local places were very good but the whole \"Carribean Room/pool\" scene was pretty unpleasant. The pool is very small, not particularly clean, and not somewhere we felt comfortable lingering. The worst part of our experience was the cigarette smoke. We did have a non-smoking room, but even with the patio door shut, smoke from the neighbors must have been seeping through the walls. Our poor little asthmatic three-year-old ended up on oral sterroids she flared so badly (handy CVS pharmacy a few blocks away). If we hadn't brought a portable nebulizer with us \"just in case,\" we likely would have ended up in the ER. Most good hotels are entirely non-smoking these days, and I no longer even think to ask about cigarette smoke. Big mistake! I would not give this hotel four stars. Maybe three without all the other issues. At best, 2 1/2. The bill for six nights, with parking and only 1 breakfast, was $2,800.

We were only in town for a few days and wanted to maximize our time in the sun, but after a day and a half of sightseeing, she said, \"Mom, I'd really just like to stay near the hotel!\" We had everything we needed ... a warm, clean pool, easy access to the beach, and shops on the boardwalk of Pacific Beach.

We book the full ocean view room as we enjoy sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine watching and listening to the ocean waves. If you like to leave the balcony access door open (to hear the waves at night) be advised that at 7:00 AM the pool area is open and it becomes a bit noisy. This is a family friendly hotel and there are kids along with the noise they create.

It was quiet enough though for us to be very relaxed even with kids around. The staff was super cheerful and professional and went out of their way to accommodate us as much as possible, even when my mom wanted to purchase 15 sunblock and the gift shop didn't have it, I think a staff member ran out to the store to buy it for us! I wish breakfast was included in the room cost, but at least complimentary coffee and tea was available to all guests in the breakfast restaurant. I have no complaints other than the fact that the room keys were very hard to get to work. Especially on the outside doors heading out to the board walk.

I must say, though, that the surrounding area, surprisingly, seems a bit \"downmarket\". Our view looked out,. partially, on a public washroom that was refuge (in bad weather) for at least four unfortunate, homeless individuals. In good weather, they spent nights on the wooden walkway to the beach. While I sympathize with their plight - it set up a strange combination of resort versus homeless neighbors. Just what were we trying to accomplish - relaxation? or dealing with reality? In looking back on Trip Advisor comments (on return home), I noted that this situation was pointed out a couple of times back in 2009 - so its been going on for a while. So, it seems, it is a long-term issue there. I suppose the kicker for me was the nightly, late-night \"singing\" by our \"neighbors on the beach deck\". My young son joined us in bed having \"nightmares\". He said they were singing \"help me\". What do you say to that ? Other sounds along the walkway late at night were heard most nights.. So..... what should I say.? I'm not overly negative, just realistic.

We are not in the $380/night hotel crowd but this was worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime experience of hearing and seeing the surf outside our open balcony. The Capri condos next door is a much taller building and has huge search lights on its roof. It lights the white waves of the surf during the night so after dark, you can still see the waves rolling in. It was pretty incredible to fall asleep to the sounds and sights of the ocean. The room was sumptuous and we enjoyed it very much. This hotel is one of those places where you don't ever really see work being done but you know there must be many workers to keep it all so perfect all the time. This was our first exposure to extra fees for everything. Our \"extras\" bill was over $200, above our pre-paid room/taxes. That was just parking, internet and breakfasts, not even the mini bar or room service. Breakfast was posted as $9 but it had 2 kinds of fees/taxes added to that which made it $13. I'm sure those things don't matter to the money-is-no-object crowd. This location is second to none. The boardwalk is about 5 yards past the edge of our pool/breakfast area, and then the sand and water are just below that. We soaked up the ambiance of rollerbladers, yoga'ists, surfers and California culture. Things I found odd about our room: the shower had beautiful luxury glass doors, but were placed on a standard hotel tub, which meant you had to shower with your arms up to not bump into the (marble) walls or glass doors. It was very very clean, but I still think it's gross to rub against a shower wall.The water pressure was also nothing great. The bed frames were outrageously beautiful handcarved wood. The wierd part was that the rim part of the frame running around the mattresses was about 8 inches wide. Just swinging my legs down off the tall bed without thinking about it resulted in a number of good bruises. This was a bed where you had to calculate your strategy for reaching the floor. And they don't have any King beds, just queens. I'm sure this is every hotel's battle near salt water, but there were several bits where the drywall was crumbling or rusting metal showed through. Our balcony railings seemed painted not too long ago, but you could tell it was bubbly and rough from rust underneath.

The top reasons why: 1. Best sleep I've ever had in any hotel, ever. Beds/bedding are extremely comfortable, but leaving the balcony door open and falling asleep to the sound of waves is incredible. Sometimes when I'm having trouble sleeping at home I literally imagine I'm at the Pacific Terrace. Sounds cheesy, but it's true. 2. Best balconies and views. Pay the extra money for a Full Ocean View room, and request the 3rd floor. I mean it. On our last trip we booked last minute on a holiday, so we had to take a first floor Partial View. I had to keep pretending I'd never been there before so I wouldn't keep feeling sad about what we were missing. The rooms are still lovely, the landscaping is still beautiful, and we could still hear the ocean, but there's simply no comparison. 3. Wonderful rooms. The carved wood furniture, pretty ceiling fans, and floor to ceiling plantation-style shuttered doors make me feel happy every time I walk in the door. Most hotel rooms, even suites, usually make me feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable. These rooms make me never want to leave. Of course, I spend most of my time on the balcony watching the surfers. 4. Great pool for the kids, great lounge area for me. The kids like to swim for hours, and it can be a dreaded chore for me when a hotel pool doesn't have a pleasant lounge area. I could sit by this pool all day and be perfectly happy. The pool is not too big, not too deep, and 3 feet from the boardwalk so you can watch the kids, people going by, and sunsets on the ocean all at the same time. The full-length glass walls help keep out the wind (and wandering people) without losing the view. At night they light torches all around and light up the numerous palm trees with Christmas lights. It's awesome. 5. Just a few steps to the the beach. The stairs from the boardwalk to the beach are about 20 feet from the hotel. You can go from your room to the sand in 60 seconds, and jump right in the hot tub when you get back. There is an extremely helpful warm water shower station by the pool to wash away all the sand. All this accessibility to the beach, and yet we still feel very safe with every gate requiring room keys for entrance. These are just the main reasons why we love this hotel. There are also nice things like friendly service, good breakfast, great restaurants, fun bars, beautiful weather, clean rooms, awesome housekeeping, plenty of big towels, comfy robes, complimentary beach toys and boogie boards, and particularly delicious cookies every afternoon. It can be a little expensive during the peak season, but it's still worth it. So often, with hotels in this price range, you feel like you've paid a lot of money for a fancy lobby and a room that's no better than an $100 Marriott. We compare every other hotel we stay in with the Pacific Terrace, and haven't found one yet that we like better.

The front desk staff is young, cheerful and very accomodating. When my husband and I arrived after our wedding, we were greeted and given fresh baked cookies and some fruit to snack on. After a quick check-in we headed to our room. It's a smaller hotel than we've stayed in before, but it had a nice \"private\" feeling to it, perhaps due to the size and more upscale decor. We had a perfect view of the pool area and the ocean from our top floor, centre room suite. It was incredible falling asleep and waking up to the gentle sound of the Pacific Ocean right outside our large balcony window. In fact, the way the room and bed are positioned, we could actually watch the ocean as we lie in bed. It was far enough into the room, however, that there was no worry of anyone outside looking in. The spa tub in suite was huge and extremely comfortable, easily fitting my 6'2\" husband and my 5'2\" self with room to spare. The toiletries were nice and they provided toothbrushes and toothpaste in addition to the usual upscale soaps, hair products and lotions. Our toilet did stop working after one use, but after a quick call to the front desk, an \"Engineer\" came and fixed it within minutes. We were very impressed. For all the bigger name hotels we could've picked for our wedding night in San Diego, we're both in agreement that we made the best choice going with a smaller, but perhaps more detail-oriented hotel such as the Pacific Terrace.

They felt wonderful, but the location of the \"spa\" area was right off of the workout room and right inside of the parking area...so it was incredibly noisy, which did take away from the relaxation. We did have to close our sliders in the morning as well as there were lots of garbage trucks, sirens, car horns, etc. so, way too noisy to sleep with the door open.

The room was clean had two queen beds, large bathroom and patio. The staff was fantastic. From the front desk to the maintenance fellows. They were all polite, helpful, friendly. Every night when I arrived back at my room the sheets had been turned down, couple of chocolates left on my pillow. They also left a print out with pictures of the staff on that evening and the weather forecast for the next day. Everyday they also make suggestions of things to see or do while there on your stay.. Although I didn't like the location of the gym it had everything I needed for my workout. Great pool and hot tub with a view of the ocean. The boardwalk was a great place for strolling or jogging. Although the hotel does not have a restaurant it is surrounded by them. Stroll down the boardwalk and have breakfast at Konas, arrive early there is always a line up. This hotel is located in Pacific Beach, the location is ideal. Walk to Mission Blvd. hop on a bus and be in downtown San Diego touring the Gaslamp District in less than 30 minutes. Head in the opposite direction and 20 minutes later your in La Jolla. I attended my conference at a resort down the street and was happy that I had decided to stay at the Pacific Terrace.

We had planned to stay in a partial ocean view room, but received a call from the hotel before the trip with an offer to upgrade to the Executive Suite. It was a little extra per night, but SOOO worth it. The room was incredibly spacious with 2 very comfortable queen beds, huge flat screen tv, dvd player, sound system, sofa, dining table and small kitchen area with a mini bar and fridge. We even commented that the suite was probably bigger than our small townhouse at home. There was also a spacious private balcony with a partial view of the ocean which was close enough to hear the waves crashing and watch the surfers. I highly recommend the 3rd floor rooms for best view and least street noise. The bathroom was beyond belief with a HUGE jacuzzi tub, walk-in shower, spacious closet, dressing and makeup area AND a TV!!! Watch a movie from the tub or while you're getting ready. An array of toiletries were provided including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath salts, shower gel, mouth wash, toothpaste and tooth brushes. The maid service was amazing; they respected our privacy and as soon as we left just for a short time, we came back to a made up room without ever seeing the staff responsible. The front desk and all other staff were all very helpful and accommodating. The heated pool and jacuzzi were very nice and the hotel location cannot be beat. It's just off the ocean and a very short walk to many restaurants, bars, nightlife, and shopping. As for the rates, they were pricey and parking is extra, but sometimes you get what you pay for and we left feeling like this stay was worth every penny.

There must just be something \"magical\" about Pacific Terrace. In our times, with everyones busy lives, for all of these happy guests to sit down and take the time to write multiple paragraphs praising this hotel must say something great about this jewel of a hotel. We are rate shoppers! Never once in negotiating our room rates, comparing with other hotels, etc., did the staff ever make us feel \"cheap\" or badly for trying to get the most room for the money- quite the opposite in fact. Paul, Danielle and Carli were all wonderful to deal with as we changed rooms (different views and sizes) three times before deciding on one! When we arrrived at 7:00 am (after a 6 hour drive from Phoenix) they took our number and promised to get the room ready early for us...they also recommended a restaurant up the street called Hennesseys. The concierge Katherine overheard us looking for a place to eat breakfast, called the restaurant and arranged for us to get a two for one breakfast:) Hennesseys also is a wonderful, casual place to eat- equally friendly and accomodating staff... low key though, so if you are looking for \"fancy\" this is not your place! Great food, great drinks- and a very lively football watching group was their clientele! So, true to their word, we got our room early... having booked a full ocean view and coming out to see palm trees blocking our view- we asked to switch rooms.... again- NO PROBLEM:) They rushed a bellman up to us- he helped us pack up the room we had just unpacked and they moved us down the hall- the whole time assuring us that the room we had was the only one with the palm tree \"blockage\" and not to feel badly about wanting to switch. We did this and got the most AMAZING view!!! After a long day of sun, drinking and eating, we decided to rent a movie on the PPV they offer at the hotel- being technologically challenged, we had to call down a few times to figure out how to get it to work- again- no problem... every request, small or large was met with a smile, and NO PROBLEM- that should be the theme for this hotel- WE HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH AMAZING SERVICE AS IN THIS HOTEL! We have stayed in resorts in many cities- many of them more expensive and \"high end\" with less amenities, and certainly worse service. Its as though the entire staff goes to customer service seminars on a nightly basis to keep it so consistent:) One last thing we would like to point out, and yes we are going to mildy bash a couple of the other beachfront hotels here- Ocean Park Inn, Tower 23, Beach Cottages, Best Western Blue Sea Lodge..... We have stayed at these places. We have occasionally made reserverations and then called the cancel them... well, before staying this time at Pacific Terrace, we had also booked a room for $30 less at Ocean Park Inn. When we booked the room at Ocean Park I called Pacific Terrace to cancel- they didnt just say \"ok, heres your cancellation number\"- they asked why? And they asked if there was anything they could do so we didnt have to break the reservation....it worked! Even though Pac Terrace was higher by $30 a night, we stayed with them- number 1- because they made us feel that our visit mattered- number 2- they offered us a nice bottle of wine! So, I then called Ocean Park Inn to cancel and got \"heres your cancellation number\"- not even a why.... that kind of service with our kind of take on it could mean thousands of extra dollars a month for one hotel over the other! Our special thank yous to Katherine, Paul, Kyla, Carli, Danielle, Angela, Ted and the bellman- sorry guys we do not remember your names!

I can't add much to what others have to say. While the facility is great, it is the people that make it special. Everyone welcomes you and asks what they can do to make the visit more pleasurable. The only thing I'd nitpick -- and this is a function of staffing, not the individuals ... we found the pool beverage service to be a bit uneven, having to track down the person to order a drink once in a while. There is plenty of seating outside now for breakfast, and the food is excellent. I did the \"cook to order\" each morning and it was well prepared and fast. No restaurant on site is not an issue, as there are lots of places to eat very close, and room service is available. One comment on parking ... some have said to pass on the underground parking ($20 per day) and find a spot on the street. At least during the busy season forget it --- there is really no street parking close by. Try the first night in the garage, and then look yourself ... but the $20 is worth it.

The view of the surfers riding the waves is great, from your balcony or from the pool area. Plenty of restaurants and shops within an easy walk. Drive north a few miles to La Jolla to see the seals or snorkel with the leopard sharks, or just take in the gorgeous scenery. Only 10-15 minutes from downtown, the zoo and the aiport. The hotel: The rooms have an elegant touch to them, yet are very comfortable. The beds were great, the bathroom had plenty of space (separate vanity area), and there is a large hi-def TV. The balconies were roomy enough for the four of us to have our pizza while taking in the view. The pool is not huge, but it's fine because the hotel is small. Everything is lit up at night, giving it a very warm, romantic feel even with the kids there. Amenities: Large towels are provided in your room when you arrive to use at the pool and/or beach. They are yours for the duration, but they are happy to provide fresh ones. There is free lemonade, iced tea and water in the Caribbean room by the pool, and cookies during happy hour. Boogie boards were provided for the kids at no charge. The continental breakfast included in the rate was more than adequate with bagels, danishes, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee. Parking is $20, but it includes valet service. There are also computers with free internet access and printers for guest use. Service: The staff is what really pushes this hotel over the top. Everyone had a smile and a hello, and seemed eager to please. Check-in was a breeze, and the front desk was happy to provide info on food, shops, etc. Our room was made up each day while we were out, and the kids loved the chocolates with the turn-down service.

The location - gorgeous, funky, convenient, safe, walking distance to lots of things, and best of all...not downtown. The roar of the surf is part of the appeal, as well as the view and people watching. The hotel feels small and intimate - you recognize when there are new people at breakfast in the morning. We would get up before our kids, sneak out of the room and go have coffee and read the paper poolside while they slept - glorious. The hotel has quite an international feel of the clientele, and there are plenty of kids around. Another amazing thing - and even our kids kept commenting on it - was how nice everyone is. From the housekeeping staff that would run things to our room to the engineer that was fixing the pool heater at 10:00 at night and proudly said it would be ready for us in the morning, the staff was simply outstanding. And finally, I have one tip and a final compliment for the staff. We knew that we were going to go to the Wild Animal Park, Zoo and Sea World while we were there, but decided not to buy the 3-1 pass online because the hotel web site said they sold discounted tickets. As it turns out, they are unable to offer the same discount that you can get online due to restrictions from Sea World, so it ended up costing us more to buy at the hotel. It was MY mistake, as I didn't ask ahead of time where to purchase them. However, the hotel CREDITED ME the difference between what I would have paid online and what they can charge! I'm not kidding - these people are the best. So, buy your tickets online, but stay at the Pacific Terrace when you visit.

They were almost too generous with the towels and bath products! The resort is on the north end of a 3 1/2 mile boardwalk: if you get up before the crowds it's an awesome run. Definitely rent bicycles and pedal down to Mission Bay and through the lovely park. The boardwalk is mighty busy, but the hotel is a little off of where the action is so you wouldn't even realize how crazy busy Pacific Beach actually is while staying at the hotel: but just walk out the door and south one block and you're in the middle of it all! We enjoyed watching the surfers at all hours of the day from our balcony, and pool area was tropical and lovely. The concierge took care of every possible question and request we had. My husband and I felt perfectly comfortable on our own at the hotel, but it was filled with families who seemed to be having a great time as well. I didn't feel overrun by all the kids there, and our visit was still quite romantic. My only suggestion is try not to rent a room on the south side of the hotel - the balconies overlook the parking garage and a street that seemed very busy with early morning surfers: you might find that action disturbing. Spring for a room overlooking the pool. Although there was no restaurant on the premises, there are great places to eat steps from the door.

The hotel employee encouraged me to upgrade to this suite, over a standard 2 queen, to make our stay here more enjoyable, with the extra space & bed. It had an extra cost of $75 but after speaking w/him agreed to additional charge. We were very excited, as we had not stayed at this hotel in the past 5 years, but before this time had stayed many times and had been very pleased. Upon arrival we were given the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jr. Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which seemed to be a standard room with 2 queen beds. I went to the front desk, and asked about the sofa sleeper, and explained this was the reason I had upgraded to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the standard queen. They told me there must have been some mistake. They offered a larger suite, which had a sofa sleeper, with no view to compensate. I told them the reason for our stay was for the view. They then stated they had a comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bed which had an additional $20 charge, which they were willing to comp for the misunderstanding. We received the bed, which was a little twin blow up mattress, which rested directly on the floor. After we had settled into our room, we began to hear hammering and pounding from the room below our room. We called the front desk to ask about this. They informed us the room below us was under construction, and was being re-carpeted. We asked how long the pounding would continue and we were informed it would be another hour. The hammering and pounding continued all afternoon. We had to leave the room because the noise was so loud. When we returned to the room, and went to sleep, the blow up bed I was sleeping on had a hole in it, and I slept the entire night on the floor. In the morning, we went to get a towel from the pool area to take to the beach. The security guard yelled at us, and treated us like we were criminals-he wanted to know how we got into the pool area. I explained I had used my key. The guy seriously needs to learn some customer service skills. I went to the front desk, and spoke to the same lady I had been speaking to all along, blonde with glasses. She had a great big smile, and tried to pacify me with it. She wanted to make things \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for all of our hassle. She told me that we could stay another night at no charge. I asked her which room we would be able to stay in. She told me we could not stay in our same room, because it was booked. She had someone show me a room they could offer us. The room was a large room, w/NO VIEW... the view was of a hotel next to ours. Upon returning to the front desk, we told her it would not work for what we had paid to stay, she said there was another room with an excellent view that might be available, and that we should go and do our daily activities, and then she would call us when she knew if it would be available. After waiting 1 hr, we had not heard back, so we went to have breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Again HUGE disappointment\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it is not what it used to be.

We told her we could not make a decision, until we were able to see what kind of a room they were willing to offer. She said she was not able to show it to us, but encouraged us to just \"take the offer\". We then went to the 2nd floor, where the room was that they were offering, and saw the door open, and asked the maintenance staff who were working on the room if we could take a peek. There was no view, except for a view of the parking lot and public beach bathrooms. Once we saw the view, we understood why she refused to show us the room. We then called the front desk, and told them we would be checking out, and we wanted a discount on our room for all of the issues we had experienced.

We had a decent continental breakfast included in our room rate -- additional items or a hot cooked breakfast could be added. Breakfast on the terrace was lovely but a bit chilly - a heater or two would have been nice. Pool was small but well kept and our kids really enjoyed it.

We loved so much about this hotel! First, the location. It's in Pacific Beach, which is just south of LaJolla. Whereas LaJolla has hoity-toity boutiques, fancy restaurants, and Bentley dealerships, Pacific Beach has taco stands and surf shops. It's got a casual, funky, surfer-dude feel. We loved it. If you don't want to have to get dressed up, and you want to walk to any number of casual seafood restaurants for dinner, this is the spot for you. THe hotel is right on the boardwalk, but about two blocks down from the more commercial area, so you avoid the noise and chaos. You access the beach by going down a staircase. We could watch the surfers from our balcony window. The view is amazing. The pool is small, but managed somehow, even during spring break with lots of families there, to have seats for everyone each time we went. The pool has a glass wall separating it from the boardwalk, which allows a great view, but protects from the wind. Our room, a suite, was very large and comfortable. The furnishings are a little bit dated, but very nice nonetheless. The staff bends over backwards to make you comfortable, whether it's cocktails by the pool or going to nearby restaurants to pick up \"room service\" for you.

Pacific Terrace is in a great location for watching the Pacific, the surfers, the skaters, and also some highly transient people who frequent this area. The staff are young but try to be very helpful and many of them will go out of the way to assist. But they do not have the experience to provide superior attention to details that many reviewers have come to expect. Their intentions are the best but in my observation the hotel management seems to be absentee. When the rooms were redecorated 4-5 years ago they brought in horrible beds that have huge wooden frames. They were supposed to be luxurious -- but fail miserably. The beds are high and the wooden frames are very large and uncomfortable when one gets into and out of the bed. They probably cost the hotel a fortune (or maybe not-- perhaps the manufacturer realized their design flaws) but they seem as if they will be around for a while although they look dated now. (Management has even added a small set of steps to use to get into the bed--like the ones you see on TV for your dog) Large flat screen TV is supposed to compensate for the bed issues I imagine... (don't forget your remote) Over the years I have found that the rooms are VERY variable in cleanliness, view, comfort and amenities. If you don't like the first room you are assigned, ask for another. Unless you want to keep tabs on children and the pool, I strongly advice a second or third floor for the view and the improved security (although the property is secure-- the open door to a private balcony is better than a room where people parade by and can look in..) They need to go to a better system for breakfast-- The management should simply find a way to include it. I am sure I'll be back but would rather stay on the harbor.

Even the housekeeping person left a personal card. Very comfortable bed. I don't like soft beds, but I liked theirs. A big flat screen TV was nice. Heated pool was great.

It was too cold for swimming, but we dipped out feet in the cold sea. Many surfers and wind surfers in the morning. Fun to watch. Refrigerator in the room was nice. They wrongly charged us for the mini-bar, but upon protest, they promptly corrected the error. Their hotel description didn't say anything about having to pay for wireless internet. Other amenities requiring surcharge was clearly listed. Wi-Fi was not listed among those for-fee amenities. However, I learned that they charge $10-$12 per day for Wi-Fi. They gave me the first day free. I didn't use Wi-Fi after the free day, since they had a desktop with printer for guests in the hallway near the front desk. They should clearly state about charging for Wi-Fi. BTW, I think all hotels should provide free Wi-Fi. Charging for it is like charging for cable TV channels. I rather have free Wi-Fi and for-fee cable channels. Cheap roadside motels like Best Western provides free Wi-Fi. What's up with upscale hotels charging for it? I parked on the street everyday. Never had problem finding a spot or safety. As people leave the beach in the evening, spots always opened up. Front desk people will tell you where you can park for free. The spots near the public restroom is swept every weeknight, and you can't park there overnight. Overall, it is a very nice hotel with upscale service.

We have been to San Diego many times before, but now that our children are older, we wanted something out of the Hotel Circle Drive area. Voila, the Pacific Terrace Hotel. We weren't sure what to expect, having booked this site unseen. But we were pleasantly surprised when we checked in. Even during the booking (by phone), reservation staff were friendly, personable and extremely accomodating. At check-in, the staff were laid-back and ensured everything was in order before we went up to our room. The room was beautiful and the balcony (oceanview) was incredible. Carpets could've used a cleaning, but it's normal wear and tear. The hotel was so quiet, that our upstairs neighbours actually called to complain about our noise, lol (we are usually the ones calling to complain). We were on the balcony around 9pm the night we checked in and probably were a bit loud. Breakfast at the hotel is extremely reasonable and is served every morning. Housekeeping is timely and does a great job. All other staff are great and they met our every request and asked us lots before we had to if we needed anything. Only downside is the beach neighbourhood. The area is full of the stereotypical \"California beach bum\" type. Not necessarily a negative if that's what you are expecting. The boardwalk is very close to the rear of the hotel, but far enough that you don't get any noise from passers by. We slept with the balcony door open at night and felt completely safe. Swimming pool is great, although they could use a more experienced bartender.

Hm... not a nice thing to stand with 300 USD in cash, when your plane is taking off the same day. Also, since we prolonged the stay, we got a 2nd welcoming call, as if we had just checked in:) Another weired thing - two evenings the staff knocked on the door to deliver the note who's on duty, ask if we needed anything (if we would, we would call!) and give us some small chockolates.

The mirror had dried spatters on it (it wasn't dirty when we left the room) dirty glasses were replaced on the tray, and the iron and ironing board were left in the middle of the room (I put it in the corner when we left that morning). When I went to wash my hands I noticed that the \"clean\" hand towel was damp like someone dried their hands on it. Note: all towels were used by us and piled into the corner next to the tub. Went to use a robe and untied it only to find a long black hair inside the robe. This robe was not tied as neatly as the other one so I suspect housekeeping replaced a \"used\" robe on the hook. The Night Manager moved us to our SECOND ROOM because the AC was going to take a couple of days to fix. This room was the largest suite they had but we were told we could only stay for 1 night because it was booked the next day. Both balconies were very slippery like someone waxed the slate floor - wierd. This wasn't the case on our first room's balcony. My husband used the jacuzzi tub and the drain plug wouldn't come up so we had to pry it open with a knife. This huge and expensive room did not have a closet! There was 1 armoir with a rod but it was about 10 inches too short so our slacks and dresses. crumpled at the bottom. The manager seemed shocked at this revelation Our THIRD ROOM was mercifully free from any obvious issues but it was smaller than the room I originally booked but we were so tired of all the problems we just let it go.

We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and its proximity to the ocean. The hotel is wonderful. All of the staff, from check-in, to the maid service, the bellhops, even the maintenance guys in the elevator were awesome and made us feel like special guests. Pros -Hotel is super clean, very nice overall -Rooms are awesome and decorated with real furniture not the normal cheap hotel stuff! -Nice pool with great bar service from very helpful staff -The view of the ocean is awesome. We had an Oceanfront King on the 2nd floor. I would try to get one of the end rooms that face the ocean when I return. All have awesome views but the hotel is sort of C shaped facing the ocean. The end rooms have the awesome view but don't have to overlook the pool. Either way, the view is awesome and will not disappoint. -Location is within walking distance to all sorts of original restaurants. Ask the front desk, they will guide you. Make sure you eat at Taco Surf, just 1 block away on the main road. Its a wonderful little dive Mexican restaurant. Very clean and delicious. The kids (ages 3 & 5) liked the pizza next door and I was able to bring it in to Taco Surf. Cons - these are nit picky but you cannot review all positives! -A little pricey. I booked on their website and chose the Internet prepay deal. The price ended up going down a bit, so I called and was upgraded. But, I would say the price is justified given the service, location, and cleanliness of this hotel. -Self parking is $20 per day. With the price of the rooms, this should be included. Good luck parking the car if you refuse to use their parking. -I called to ask if they were on the beach. I was told they are 15 steps from the beach. Not true, they are 15 feet from the beach, but if you took 15 steps towards the beach, you would fall down a 30 foot cliff. Now, however, they are on an awesome boardwalk and located between 2 sets of stairs to get to the beach. The stairs are probably 45 feet in either direction. We explored the area quite a bit, and we believe this is the nicest beachfront hotel in the area. There are so many nice touches, from the furniture, to the turn down service, to the printed information delivered to your room telling you what staff is available overnight even with their pictures, and just the overall great, secure feeling you have while staying here.

We had already booked 4 nights at Loew's Coronado, but wanted to start our trip early and stay somewhere else the night before. I was watching the rates on Expedia and I saw the Pacific Terrace had a \"run of the house\" room for $99!!! The rates for the hotel normally range between $330-$550 during the summer. This was a great deal, so I booked it. I knew that this rate was most likely for a \"non-ocean view\", but I was hoping that we could upgrade when we got there. I called the hotel before we left and they told me that they had quite a few rooms left so I knew that we had a good chance of getting upgraded. When we got there, they offered us a \"full ocean view\" room for only $30 more!!! What a bargain! So we paid $129 for a full ocean view in the middle of the summer. So I would like to give my thanks to the crappy economy for making this possible. As for the room, it was flawless as it was back in 2006. We were on the 3rd floor and the views were incredible. The decor of the room was awesome and you can tell that they spared no expense when this place was built (or refurbished). If I had my choice, I would have brought a pillow out on the balcony and slept there. Hands down, this is one of my favorite hotels in San Diego and one of the top 10 in the country. I have stayed at many, many top rated hotels throughout the country and I can tell you that this one is right up there. While there are some negatives (no restaurant), I can overlook those based on the views, room quality, and friendliness of the staff. By the way, they offer free internet as well!!! I only wish that this place was still an \"unfound gem\" as it was back in 2006 when the rates were low.

There were all guys except one girl who was in a bathing suit that was 3 sizes too small for her body. Not pretty for the family scene. They began to smoke and carry on. It's all good, believe me. I was a punk once too. But not for $400 thanks. The concierge and my wife had a mis communication about dinner reservations but it was finally worked out. We went to the trendy JRDN at the Tower 23 hotel a few blocks away. The babysitter that the hotel arranged was great btw. JRDN started off with a thud. There's lots to write here but I will leave it to Urbanspoon. Look for my review there. Just prepare yourself for lots of trendy but no substance. We inquired about the change in guest profile and were told they would \"ask them to calm down\" if need be. Ya.... no thanks. I don't need to be shot in the garage.

Some of us got Jr Suites with nice views, I got a regular first floor room with a view of the ocean through the pool area. Which was blocked by the plants they have. They waived the parking fee for us in the garage because we stayed for 11 days. Granted I would have been reimbursed if they charged us anyways. The staff was very accomodating. I wanted a microwave in my room, and they brought one up to me. However the way they plugged it in, I kept killing the power strip it was plugged into. Which didn't help at 4 am when I was getting up. (Jet lag from East Coast) The staff would always recommend a good place to eat for me. both nearby and further away. They gave me directions to both Target and Walmart (I forgot to pack a swim suit). The TV was nice and big. Being able to listen to the ocean at night was a plus, expect on the weekends with kids who were there to party checked in, then I couldn't sleep well. The pool was very warm, which helped with the very cool breeze coming off the ocean. Ok now the negatives. I contacted the hotel before my trip to inquire about HSIA. They said it was wireless in the hotel, and there are no wired connections in the rooms. Ok fine, I took a wireless laptop with me. I decided not to bring DVD's with me (since I was traveling for such a long period of time), relying on my Netflix streaming account to watch movies online. BIG mistake!!! The conneciton signal in the room was a 3 bar, 4 if I was lucky. There are no Desk level electrical outlets, so you have to search for one for your computer. In this age of Internet access, I would expect a wireless signal of at least 4 to 5 anywhere in the hotel. Oh well. I meant to ask for turn down service at a different time, because when I got back from work, I would turn my own bed down. But the little chocolates they provided are nice. Thier breakfast was a JOKE. It was easier to make my own in my room (after I got the microwave). Of course we headed into work at 6am. so breakfast wasn't even being served yet.

I get it from a business point of view but I am paying $400 a night and the guy next to me is paying $150-200. Here's an idea. Lower all the prices a little bit and maybe that would book out more rooms for a longer period so the hotel would not have to lower themselves to a business practice straight out of ebay. In the past they offered a continental breakfast now they are trying to make the very little dining room more then it can be.

All of the extra charges (parking, etc) made me feel like I was being nickel and dimed, and if I'd had to pay full price it wouldn't have been worth it. They did have a \"continental breakfast\" one morning - which was a danish and an orange juice - and $9 for an omelet and some sausage.

The hotel itself is perfectly situated on Mission Beach with most rooms offering terrific views of the ocean as well as the hotel's beautiful, warm and lighted pool surrounded by comfy lounge chairs (some under a shaded canopy that I certainly needed for my red head!) The grounds are beautiful and well kept up with maintenance people all over collecting towels and any litter that (rarely) seemed to find its way to the pool area. What I loved about the pool is that there was no smoking, no food and beverages (since the eating area patio was just steps away) and no music....Just peace and quiet. Even the very few children in the pool were quiet and well behaved. The tone was just automatically set to be this tranquil. We swam everyday despite SD having a record cold spell during our trip. When I asked the hotel desk to turn up the heat in the pool even more than the 80 degrees it was set at, they immediately complied and the next day, and for the rest of our trip, the pool was a haven away from the cold winds off the Pacific. Each room has a fantastic balcony where we had our breakfast delivered daily. To look at the beautiful ocean and that pristine beach over coffee every morning was the best way to start our day. There is also a walkway along the ocean path for bikes, rollerblades and the like, but we loved walking on this amazing beach best with its hard packed damp sand making it super easy to traverse. The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, lovely furnishings and lighting, new, clean carpeting, and plenty of space to stretch out. The staff, though, is what made this a special trip for us. We were treated with such cheerful smiles and genuine offers of help in every way by every staff member there. Lynette, Ted, and Cassie were especially helpful. Lynette brought us complimentary wine one evening for us to enjoy on our balcony and even remembered a treat for our 3 year-old son, Leo. The housekeeping staff, too, was exceptional, going out of their was to accommodate our changing needs daily. We loved them all! My partner didn't want me to even write this review for fear that the hotel will become too popular, but they really deserve kudos for their fine service and wonderful facilities. Even with the \"incident\" of a broken water main on our first night, leaving all of us with no showers for 36 hours, the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable and were profusely apologetic about the accident (which wasn't in any way their fault to begin with.) It was impossible to be angry about it with the entire staff scrambling to help us all out. I wouldn't necessarily go to San Diego again just for Sea World and the Zoo (the main reason we took our son) but knowing that we could stay at the Pacific Terrace again ensures that we will, in fact, be back.

Not a lot of high end restaurants, but quite a few mid-range / family friendly ones to choose from, all walking distance - Reasonable drive to Sea World, the Zoo, Old Town, downtown, etc. - Excellent front desk staff; always extremely helpful - Excellent room staff - Prepare to be surprised by how nice the furniture is. - LOVED the two 40\" flat screen hi-def TVs with DVD's.

My wife eventually figured it out. - Gave up on the valet parking by the end of the first day.

Good thing we weren't in a hurry to catch our plane... this alone would make it impossible for me to ever consider staying here on a business trip - Standard collection of all the usual hotel annoyances... cracked wine glasses, sinks that don't drain properly (and the SMELL when they don't...), only tolerably clean carpet, one of the phones didn't work, yada yada yada. - The pool is definitely on the small side, and some days it was a challenge getting a lounger. In the end, while we enjoyed our stay there, we wouldn't go back. Or at least if we did, we wouldn't stay in the family suite, which cost us over $600 per night.

Above all, it is located above a really attractive beach, and there is a great view of the sunset from the beach. However, parking is extra, a rollaway air-bed is extra, and the total cost is similar to a 5 star hotel, which is I think hard to justify.

Previous posters complained about the lack of a restaurant and that is a bit annoying. We found that that Pacific Beach is not a center of fine dining so you have to make the best of it. It's a beach community so expect mostly casual dining with many restuarants you can easily walk to. We liked the locations at both the Green Flash and Tower 23.

The hotel has no bad rooms just better. The nonview rooms have some views. i would recommend the north side rooms if you have a choice. The breakfast is substantial and they serve Starbucks coffee. Many people grab food downstairs and eat it on their balconies. In the afternoon, they have a wine hour. The $20 parking fee is well worth it. Pacific Beach parking is some of the worst I have ever experienced. You can leave your car and get almost anywhere The boardwalk and beach are right there. You can easily walk to a number of different restaurants of varying prices and types. The downside was no hotel restaurant and even though they provide room service through nearby restaurants it sometimes was cold by the time we got it. Still, it was available. I have stayed at a number of 4 to 5 star hotels and found this to be the most enjoyable because of the staff and their attitudes. They seemed to honestly enjoy what they were doing and enjoyed seeing how well they could do and how they could make it better for you.

When researching hotels in the area, I came across a couple of travel sites with old outdated pictures, when I went directly to the hotels site, I was surprised at how lovely the rooms were. I called the hotel to confirm, that the pictures on their site were current, and I was told that all the rooms have been completely remodeled. I booked a partial view double bed room for 159.00 plus tax (what a bargain) since the price for that class room is normally 440.00 The only downfall was no king bed. I requested for for a room on the 3rd floor, I was told that they couldn't guarantee it, but that he would note that I am requested a room on the 3rd floor. After reading several reviews, I had mixed feelings, but it was really the only beachfront hotel I could find in the 200.00 price range, that looked maintained. The staff was super friendly, attentive and professional. I have never been to a hotel that every class (bellboy, front desk, house keeping, cafe, security) of employee was kind, courteous and willing to bend over backward to accommodate your needs. This hotel is VERY customer service orientated. Upon check in, I asked if they could accommodate us with a king bed, mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary (really tried). Unfortunately they were unable to do so, since they were completely booked. They were able to accommodate my request for the 3rd floor, as the view is so much nicer. Some reviewers complaining about the 20.00 underground parking, but the peace of mind is worth it, very safe, key access only, and direct access from hotel elevator. The room decor was very inviting and up to date. Nice dark solid wood beds, granite counter tops, marble bathroom, huge plasma TV, ipod player clock radio, snack bar, coffee maker, iron, blow dryer, safe. The room was immaculate, and well stocked with towels, comfy bathrobes, bath goods even q-tips & cotton balls. The beds were very comfortable, pillows were fluffy, the sheets were high thread count and super soft. The balcony was spacious, with 4 chairs and a table. Our room was facing South toward the pier, and it was an amazing view. I could have sat on that balcony our whole visit just listening to the waves crash and people watched. There was a little parking lot below our balcony, that was normally occupied by surfers. I had a blast watching the surfers change in and out of wetsuits in the parking lot, lol. It was a little noisy at times (car alarms, beeping delivery trucks, ice cream truck) but I didn't mind, I liked all the action. I do have to say that there were quiet allot of homeless people in this area (most beach areas are this way), but I never felt unsafe or threatened in anyway as they just mind thier own business. Lots of restaurants, clubs and shopping on Garnet which is about a 3 block walk. This area is populated by allot of young college students, majority is 25 and under. There were a few nicer restaurants like Jordan at Tower 23 hotel which is 2-3 hotels down from PTH that had a more mature crowd 30 and over. It's definatley a lively happening area, which my husband and I enjoy. We live in Los Angeles so we are used to this type of atmosphere, it might be a little shocking to people who are not accustomed to this. Beach access is super close and easily accessed through the pool area which is accessed with your room key. We didn't use the pool/spa, but it looked really nice, heated, ton of towels and lounge chairs. I did notice allot of families on the lower level and pool are which is were the family suites are located. Which might be a little odd if you are there for a romantic getaway or honeymoon. Some little perks that make ALL the difference in feeling pampered........... Free iced tea, lemonade, Starbucks coffee (self serve) Basket of apples and fresh baked cookies in the lobby Free wine from 4-5PM in the cafe (self serve) Turn-down service, with Belgium chocolates on your pillow Basket of towels in front of every room in the morning Continental breakfast included I was expecting danishes, cereal and fruit, but the variety was impressive. 5-6 different types of pastries and muffins Bagels, croissants, english muffins (variety of cream cheeses, jams, peanut butter) Fresh fruit, variety of melons, oranges, apples, bananas Variety of hot and cold cereals Boiled eggs Yogurt Starbucks coffee, Tazo teas, Juices, milk The dining area seats about 15, but there are several tables right outside the cafe around the pool or you can get a tray and take your food to your room. If you really want to be pampered, for 12.00 you can put in a request the night before to have breakfast delivered to your room. I myself, got a tray and took it up to my room and enjoyed breakfast on the balcony watching the sun come up. This hotel went above and beyond my expectations, I will definatley be visiting PTH on a regular basis when I need to getaway with my hubby. Hopefully I can get a budget friendly rate again in the future, because $440 is a little steep. The only thing I disliked was the early check out time of 11:00am.

The wash basin is in the room itself which isn't great. The toilet and shower over the bath (which again is like a motel bathroom) are off the room separately. The \"free\" breakfast is served in pokey, dark room just off the pool - and you have to walk through it to get the pool. Breakfast is cereals, some bagels, bananas, apples and juice so don't get too excited. The pool is nice enough though smoking is allowed and with kids around, not brilliant. There is no pool service for drinks or food. There is some free wine for an hour in the afternoon but no great shakes. There is no restaurant - but there are restaurants locally who will deliver. There is free parking within walking distance of the hotel but it is limited - it's there though. Noise-wise, you can hear other balconies and because the area overlooking the pool is half-moon shaped, can be quite loud, although my 3-year old slept through soundly.

Two years ago I thought that I had found a gem and was nervous to even tell friends as I wanted to keep the secret to myself. My last stay was a week ago and I booked a partial ocean view for two nights. I knew that the rooms are rarely ready before 4pm so did not bother checking in until my conference was over for the day. Upon check in I was shown where my room assignment was and asked if there were any other rooms (I knew this one was not optimal). The gentleman at the desk told me that they were entirely sold out - he assured me that I would like the room. Needless to say, the room was not acceptable. It was directly over the lobby of the hotel and essentially faced the street with a street light shining in to the room and cars parked behind it. When I called and said that this was not what I had expected - he asked in a snippy voice \"can you see the ocean?\" to which I replied \" not really, there is a light glaring into the room\". I told him that I would prefer to check out than stay in this room and then magically there was another room. Both days that I went to the pool there were no towels for the beach or for the pool (only a pile of used towels). In fact, I stood next to a soaking wet man in the lobby the second morning as there were no towels at the pool so he was going back to his room to dry off. The \"breakfast buffett\" is in a small room that feels rather dirty - you can get a tray and bring items to your room which I recommend. The rooms are still nice although do not feel quite as pristine and new as they did 1-1/2 years ago. I agree with the reviewer who stated that if you have a car, you are roped in to the $20 parking fee as there is sparse overnight parking around the hotel.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary after several years of marriage and were looking for something different and romantic as my wife would say. I am an appraiser by profession, so I may be a little more critical in my observations. If you like a noisy beach location then this is your place. The hotel is on the beach boardwalk and lies between two feeder streets that lead to the beach. It has underground parking which is another $20 for each night. Considering the amount of beach traffic you really have no other alternative, but to pay the extra $20 for parking so factor that into your costs. We asked for a partial ocean view to take advantage of the beach location and yet to be a little more economical then the very expensive beach front location, but one had to be on the balcony to see the partial view. What was really annoying is that you were directly facing one of the streets I refer to. If you don't mind being bothered at 6 AM by people arriving at the beach then your OK, but like us, we like the slider or window ajar to get fresh air during the night when sleeping. There is late and early traffic on the streets and since the hotel is only 3 stories high you are going to be relatively close to the noisy streets regardless of which floor you are on. We were on the 2nd floor. One noise that could have been avoided is the hotel Help early in the morning. I didn't understand a word they said, but all I know is that there was one hotel worker that appeared to be in charge of the others and she was doing a lot of yelling to her subordinates in the hallway. The doors were not well insulated and we did complain to the hotel about their Help being too loud in the early mornings. The rooms were appointed rather comfortably, however, the large frame beds did make it more difficult to enter the beds, especially if you have small children or older adults who will find it difficult to climb into and out of the beds. Even exiting the beds we were hitting our shins, because the frames came up so high from the floor. Like many hotels, these beds had colorful tropical bed spreads that I would never sit on or lay on and it is obvious these bed spreads are not washed on a daily basis like the sheets are changed. The floors seemed clean and they did provide new slippers, but the slippers were one size fits all and if you wear an 11 shoe like I do then forget it. The bathroom was OK. Only one sink and the water pressure was normal. The bath tub is enclosed with a double glass doors with seals at the bottom of the doors that did not seal and if you took a shower there was more than just a pool of standing water when you exited. We had to use several towels to soak up the water and we also reported this to the hotel, because we thought it would create mold and moisture problems in the walls. The room had other features, like a small refrigerator, microwave, a small wet bar and a big screen TV. There was a hair dryer, a lighted magnifying mirror and ironing equipment. They did provide terrycloth robes that were available for purchase. One feature they did have that was upscale and that my wife enjoyed was the Gilchrist and Soames body bath soaps and cremes. On the other hand, however, what may be a little embarrassing if you are sharing a room with non-intimate guest is using the bathroom. The bath fan was too small and inadequate to ventilate the bathroom odors that penetrated to the entire room immediately. This is a design flaw in the original construction. There is no restaurant in the building, but they do provide a continental breakfast from 6:30 to 10:00 AM. in the exit room to the pool area. There is also Starbucks coffee provided all day that were in dispensors near the pool area. One evening they did have some complimentary inexpensive wines available for tasting in the late afternoon near the pool/patio area. There is a considerable amount of local shopping stores and small fast food local-owned and chain restaurants , but if you want any real fine dining you will need a vehicle to travel up to La Jolla, which is the adjacent city, which is approximately 5 miles north. Our partial ocean view room was $330 and tax was $41.25, parking $20 for a total of $391.25 per night. This price in my opinion is far too much for the accommodations that we had and for that reason and the others mentioned above this hotel is over-rated with Trip Advisor.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kenora", "Title": "\u201cnot as expected\u201d", "Author": "KenoraMmmm", "ReviewID": "UR14869410", "Content": "Booked this hotel because of good reviews on this site and expedia. Spent the time to call and book from Canada. Told the front desk we were travelling with friends with children and our child and would like rooms close by. Rooms were not ready when we got there.Also were on different floors. Had asked for 2 beds. Got a room with one bed and a pull out couch. For some strange reason the carpets had been cleaned were VERY wet and a noisy utility fan was running on the floor. To dry it out I guess. The room smelled like a hockey bag. Back to the front desk I went. I should also mention that at check in, the man at the front desk assured me I would be \"So happy with our room as the managers had just done a walk through\". VERY insincere. Back at the desk the man tells me there aren't any other rooms. So weary were we from travelling and with kids that just wanted to go swimming, we begrudgingly accepted the room (at $400 for that night; our one night in San Diego). That night we tried to sleep...all 3 of us in one bed because the pull out was hard as a rock. We could not open the sliding door to air out the smell of wet dirty socks because we were on the ground floor and were worried about someone breaking into our room in the night. I wrote a letter to the management at about midnight or 1 AM because I couldn't believe how ripped off I felt. It's really too bad that we weren't offered a different room or to even pay for an upgrade. Which we would of accepted. It is a nice little hotel, right on the beach. The boardwalk is right there. The pool is very small. but nice. I'm sure that if our room would have been what we had been expecting we would have been happy. I just couldn't sleep wondering what had happened in that room to make them clean the carpets??? The carpets had not been cleaned in our friends room...so it wasn't like they had done the whole building. (You know that creepy crawly feeling) I'm not sure if I will ever get the chance to go back to San Diego, but I would like to. It is a beautiful city. I would not stay at this hotel again. I feel I was lied to. I would like to note that I was contacted by management after my return home and was credited part of my payment.

After reading the wonderful reviews of the Pacific Terrace Hotel, we decided to spend the first half of our trip here. We were not disappointed. Everything was wonderful from the location to the staff to the beautiful rooms. I have to stay that this is one of the few hotels where I feel the hotel's photos don't do the actual rooms justice. We had booked a oceanfront junior suite. We were offered an upgrade to a master suite for a bit more money. After seeing both rooms, both of which were beautiful, we opted for the master suite because of the separate bedroom which was convenient when our little one went to bed at 8 or 9pm. It was a beautiful room with two oceanfront balconies, 3 flat screen HDTVs (including one above the jacuzzi tub), a small breakfast bar with microwave and fridge and a small dining room table. The attention to detail really made this hotel special. Everything from the bathrobes and slippers to the little stepstool in the washroom so our son could reach the sink to wash his hands and brush his teeth. There were even lovely jars of bath salts left next to the jacuzzi tub which we thoroughly enjoyed. The basket of towels in front of our door in the mornings was a nice surprise. My son loved the little chocolates left on our pillows each night. The rooms were very tastefully done with California shutters instead of the usual nasty hotel drapes. Beds were very very comfortable. My only complaint, and it really is a petty one, is that there was no freezer in the fridge. But it was not a huge deal as the wonderful staff offered to put our frozen foods and ice packs in their hotel freezer for us. Just a minor inconvenience as someone had be sent to fetch our things each day. Again like I said, a petty complaint. The continental breakfast was a nice bonus, and the food was fine - muffins, danishes, bagels and some fruit. We were never around to enjoy the afternoon wine and cookies, but appreciated the ice tea, lemonade and Starbucks coffee available throughout the day. I love boutique style, small and elegant hotels. This one definitely fits the bill. It is easily one of my new favourite places to stay and I would definitely return the next time I am in the San Diego area.", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!!!\u201d", "Author": "zman-nh", "ReviewID": "UR14415279", "Content": "The view, the room, the location, the comfortable bed-----all perfect!

It is one of the nicest rooms I've had in a hotel. I don't know what he paid for the room, but he's a great guy. He reserved us one of the King-suite ocean front rooms. It was pretty much in the center of the hotel (kind of shaped like a horseshoe a bit) and I think we had room 316. The balcony was nice sized and felt fairly private even though it overlooked the pool and deck, which is just off the main beach path running throughout PB. We slept with the door wide open at night to the sound of the crashing waves of the ocean. But, it also came with a price. Staff moving deck chairs around in the morning (6 am?) by the pool dragging the metal legs along the concrete as well as a bunch of Marines on their early morning and loud cadence jog. But, did i mention the waves? ;-) The room had gorgeous furniture (a REAL entertainment unit) a huge wide screen LG HD TV, a comfortable bed, enough tables and sitting areas to be comfortable, and lovely decor. The room is decorated throughout with dark wood working such as the crown molding and plantation shutters covering the slider door (no cheesy curtains!). It's very warm, relaxing, and tropical feeling and was reminiscent of a model home in a new housing community. The bathroom consisted of a large wide area near the door with the closet and a nice sink and countertop. One of my few complaints was the screw for the hot water knob was stripped and kept falling off it's base knob. The toliet and tub/shower are in a closed room. The main room had a huge granite counter/bar near the small kitchen area (honor bar, small fridge, microwave). We didn't need any of that (except for the $6 Amstels). Everything was clean, new, and seemed recently painted. My only major complaints are with the towels, they were not that plush or high-end comparing it to the rest of the room's offerings. Robes were provided, though. Also, the pillows on the bed were not that nice (we grabbed two more from the closet). They could use some plusher, down or feather nicer pillows. -The staff are super friendly. -You have to pay for parking in their private garage underneath the building. -We ordered room service which comes from one of two off-site local restaurants (Hennesey's was one). The food was just ok and not that worthy at all of being 5 star (like typical bar food). Too bad they don't have a better restaurant/room service on site. -Location is great, near lots of restaurants, the beach, convenience stores, etc. Though I've never stayed in PB during the high season, it was nice there mid-week in March. Read my other reviews; i'm stingy with the \"5 stars\". I think this place is really 4.5 on my typical scale, but I'll bump it up to 5.

The wine reception was a nice touch, and the continental breakfast is convenient (nothing spectacular). As for the room - beds were VERY comfortable. I'm a light sleeper and can usually only sleep well in my own bed. The only thing I found less than stellar with the room was the smallish size of the tub / shower. Also, we stayed in a premium ocean view room, and I highly recommend spending the extra $$ for one. Fantastic view. Also, it gives you some distance from the pool. There were a couple of kids that were in the pool all day and were pretty loud. We left our balcony door open so we could hear the ocean, which was great, but we could still hear the kids too as a result. I'm glad we weren't on the pool level! We didn't rent a car, but probably should have. The only cab company that didn't rob us blind getting around town was Silver Cab, so they get a free plug from me.

I have to say that this hotel is the cleanest beach hotel I have every stayed in. We had an ocean view room. It was a little smaller than I expected, but the view was absolutely beautiful. The maid service cleans your room twice a day: once in the morning, and once in the evening for turn down service. They do a great job. We brought our two toddlers and they brought their stuffed animals. The kids were so happy when we came back to our room at night to find our bed turned down, and their little stuffed animals propped up on pillows next to chocolates. The entire staff was very nice.

The continental breakfast was very good, and it was great to have fresh Starbucks coffee, tea, lemonade and iced water available all day long. Overall, our experience with this hotel was great. I only have one thing that I would warn about. The preferred driver service for the hotel. First, I want to say that Carlos was a very nice man. He was very insightful about San Diego, and told us about the best places for food and sight seeing. We spoke with the driver before we booked his service. He said he would have a car seat for us, and we do not need to bring one. When he picked us up from the airport, he came early and was in a very clean, beautiful car, but the car seat was only an infant carrier. Needless to say, I couldnt fit either of my children in it, so I had to buckle them in and pray to God that our ride would be short. Carlos does not use turn signals. Nor does he turn his head to check traffic before switching lanes or come to slow stop at traffic lights. We had planned on using him for all of our excursions, but after the ride from the airport, I was too afraid to use him. We didnt reserve a rental because we had everything planned out with the driver service. We called cab services in San Diego, but none had car seats available. We ended up taking a bus to Sea World. On the bus were a couple of local homeless people. We walked everywhere else. It rained all day on Sunday, and we were stuck inside the hotel with nothing to do but watch tv. It is not entirely Carlos' fault. He said that he had a car seat that we could use during our stay if we used his service, but he didnt know how big our kids were. When we asked him if he had a different car seat, he told us that was all he had. My very strong advice is to rent a car with car seats, or bring your own if you plan on traveling with your small children.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cwill recommend to everyone\u201d", "Author": "coacheswifeOregon", "ReviewID": "UR13104143", "Content": "We just returned from seven nights at this hotel.

I had fallen in love with San Diego on a short trip there in June and just HAD to go back. (So much to do, not enough time to do it.) Our previous visit, my husband, son, and I had stayed at Paradise Point hotel. Enjoyed it, but wanted something right on the ocean this time. (Our suite there was on the water, but the \"water\" was the BAY, and I didn't know that at the time of booking. Still a BEAUTIFUL view of the bay though.) After much research, I chose Pacific Terrace hotel for this trip. As far as I can tell, this is about as close to the beach as you can get in San Diego. (if there are any luxury hotels located directly on the beach, I'd sure love to hear about them) Pacific Terrace is up on a bluff, so do be aware that you have to traverse a rather long flight of stairs from the boardwalk down to the beach. And they seem to be twice as long when you have to climb back up them at the end of the day. That did hamper us a tiny bit as we found ourselves to be quite lazy, but it probably saved us from a worse sunburn than we already got. We spent a lot of time body boarding and just playing in the water. GREAT waves, and very attentive lifeguards. Nice beach with a great view in both directions. A cool pier just to the south and La Jolla to the north. Planes flying overhead with advertisments streaming behind them. Very much the California beach scene. I do have to say though, I liked the Mission Beach area of the boardwalk better than this area, probably because there were no bluffs separating the beach from the boardwalk and all the action. We stayed in a junior suite with a king bed. My son stayed on the sofa (which had a pullout bed he never used) and I had a huge, very comfortable bed all to myself. Loved the room. Beautiful, classy, dark wood furniture, and a very large kitchenette with a breakfast bar. Very clean and comfortable. Our suite was on the ground/pool level. I had asked for a suite as close to beach access as possible, but ended up right in the middle of the hotel with the pool between us and the boardwalk. Turns out, being on the ground floor was not a plus, given the fact that we had to take so many stairs down to the beach anyway, what's a few more inside the hotel? My view of the ocean was minimal so I was a bit disappointed with that. Next time I will request a suite on either the far north or south side of the hotel - still poolside- and probably the top floor so I can see the beach and enjoy ocean more. Good news is, our patio was fairly private, and I could still hear the ocean. I spent a LOT of time out there with my laptop using the wireless internet e-mailing my husband back home. And made friends with the mourning doves who had built a nest nearby. We used the underground parking -very convenient. We fould ourselves driving around to explore every day. The hotel seems to be close to everything and I found San Diego to be a very good city for driving. We walked around the neighborhood a lot, too and felt quite safe. Lots of tourists, a few homeless and wierdos on the boardwalk, but not anything we didn't already expect. Just be aware there are always going to be people targeting tourists in a place like this, so keep your wallet safely tucked in your front pocket, or your purse zipped and always close. I saw one guy that seemed to be scoping us out, probably to pick-pocket. He followed us around for a while, so I finally put my hands on my hips, spun around and glared at him straight in the eye, and I never saw him again. I wouldn't go walking at night though without my husband. Having a restaurant on site would have been nice, but it wasn't the end of the world. Would have liked to have seen the hotel provide a more detailed guide of area restaurants and attractions. It was difficult for us to decide where to go since we were never sure what was really in our neighborhood and what was several miles away. In all though, Pacific Terrace is a very nice hotel. GREAT rooms with plenty of space, plenty of towels outside our door every morning, good maid service, nice staff, continental breakfast, wine in the evening, but still left me wishing for an on-site restaurant and slightly easier access to the beach. But again, I still haven't heard of any luxury hotel in the San Diego area that's closer to the beach than this one, so until I do, I still rate this one as a winner.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel romantic Location\u201d", "Author": "cynbyn", "ReviewID": "UR11543757", "Content": "Lovely hotel in a great beachfront location. perfect for romantic getaways.

We booked the hotel last November based on Trip Advisor reviews...Recent reviews, with focus on the surrounding neighborhood, made us a little nervous, so we went in to the trip with low expectations. With a few minor exceptions, PT met or exceeded our expectations. What we liked: THE BEACH: It's right there, right out your window, and it's beautiful. The first couple of days, there was a lot of seaweed, but then the huge raking tractors and dump trucks came and took all that away. The surf is wonderfully noisy at night and the water is shallow for some great wading and wave jumping. We took surf lessons with Rusty Farrell (you can get his number from the hotel) and the kids (and my husband) had a blast learning to surf. THE LOCATION: Pacific Beach (PB to the locals) is a hoot. It is young, hip, laid back and great for people-watching. We loved watching all the cyclists go by on funky bikes with surf boards tucked under their arms or tiny dogs tucked into baskets on handle-bars. There are great swim shops, tattoo parlors, taco joints and bar and grills. You WILL see homeless people, but we were never panhandled to or felt unsafe. THE ROOMS: Now, we were spoiled with a premium ocean front junior suite, so I can't speak to some of the other reviews that complain about the rooms. Ours was perfect - nice balcony looking straight out to the ocean, eat-in bar, refrigerator, microwave, sink, dishes and silverware...The TV was fine - we rarely turned it on. The IPOD docking station was great...Our bathroom was well-appointed and always stocked with towels of all sizes. There was a minibar that we didn't touch...In room safe - yes, it was small - but it held our small valuables just fine. Nightly turn-down service with chocolates and light music playing on the radio was fun to come home to. We were nervous at first because our room faced the elevator, and previous reviews complained about noise, but we never noticed a thing. THE STAFF: The staff go out of their way to accommodate all requests. Nicole at the pool did an incredible job of keeping wine glasses overflowing during the 4-5 p.m. wine hour (she even offered to send someone out for my Diet Coke when we discovered the soda machine only carried Pepsi products). She also was quick with freshly baked cookies for the kids and would slice up an apple for the kids almost without having to ask. The front desk staff remembered our names, had our car brought out promptly when we needed it and were genuinely always happy to see us. Housekeeping staff were unobtrusive but also always smiling and saying hello when you passed them in the halls. One of our daughters liked sleeping on the floor in the adjacent kids' room. She made a nest of blankets and pillows and was quite happy there, preferring that over the aerobed we had rented. At night, when we returned to our rooms, the housekeepers would have arranged her nest with cozy pillows, propping up my daughter's doll and stuffed animal and making a canopy with the doll blanket. Too cute. Things to Consider: BREAKFAST: As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no restaurant on site so breakfast in the morning is a continental buffet. Given the space available to them, I think the hotel does a great job. There were muffins, pastries, croissants, bagels, and English muffins (with jams, honey, butter and peanut butter to top). Cold and hot cereal, fresh fruit (apples, orange slices, bananas, melon), orange, grape, and apple juices, milk, coffee and tea. We tend to like a lot of protein for breakfast, so after a couple of days we ventured out to Kono's (highly recommend) for their breakfast burritos. All in all, the breakfast worked for us most days and, again, the staff were so friendly and willing to help, it was a really pleasant way to start the day. Be prepared for the flies, though. The hallway along the breakfast area is \"open\" to the outside and most of the seating is outside on the patio, and flies, as we've experienced in other tropical locations, are happy to join you for your every meal. DINING: As there is no on-site restaurant, you need to venture off-site for lunch and dinner. The hotel provides a list of recommended restaurants, and there are many close by that are actually pretty good. It would have been nice to have had a restaurant in the hotel - it did get a bit tedious trying to figure out each day where to get the next meal - but it was also a great way to see the surrounding area and get out. We did end up bringing food to the pool one night which turned out to be one of the best memories of the trip... FOLLOW UP: We had a couple of glitches with the front desk and concierge that just proves the point you can never follow up enough. We learned the first night that many of the reservations I'd requested via email weeks before with the concierge just hadn't been made...Also, a couple of requests to the front desk required a follow up call. Nothing major, but worth noting. FAMILY OR LUXURY?: With the price tag, you might be tempted to think of PT as luxury. But, in our experience, while close, PT is much more a place where families can spend a relaxing vacation, on a beautiful beach location, enjoy the pool and be close to all that San Diego has to offer. We were so pleased that there were other families with children - and we met some great people we hope to keep in touch with - but could understand that those without children, who may have been expecting a quiet, romantic, luxurious hotel stay may not have gotten what they paid for. Know that the pool is open until 10 p.m. and it's mostly families - with boisterous, young children who are in it until then. If we ever find ourselves again in the San Diego area, we will definitely stay at the Pacific Terrace.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City", "Title": "\u201cPacific Terrace is terrific!!!\u201d", "Author": "Wandering_Poet", "ReviewID": "UR8505220", "Content": "The Pacific Terrace Hotel is a terrific place to stay.

I had booked the hotel as the reviews were positive and it described itself as luxury. We were disappointed as it is certainly not luxury. On the positive side the staff were friendly and helpful and the location in terms of access to a wonderful beach great. However, there were a number of factors that seriously detract from the experience. Probably the major one is the very poor \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcContinental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breakfast. It is described in their in-room video as Gourmet; it certainly was not. A luxury hotel does not serve up a selection of pastries and packets of cereals in a school tuck-shop setting using cheap plastic cups and plates, surrounded by flies and expect to call that a luxurious experience. The lack of dining facilities, or indeed what appeared to be any form of cooking facilities, meant that we dined out each evening. The local area is really geared toward the younger generation, i.e. teens/early twenties and not forty-two with a wife and two children. Hence, the dining alternatives tended to be Grilles attached to Bars and were not really suitable for a family. Note that the area was not threatening, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that the options were not really places you would take your family. The next aspect was the bathroom. In fact the shower (above a small bath) and toilet were in an en-suite that is best described as being close to a downstairs utility room. It was not a luxurious bathing experience. I have noticed in the photos posted by other reviewers that other bathrooms looked larger. We stayed in a Partial Ocean View room; maybe other types of rooms are better. We also had problems with our air conditioning, it worked very rarely and the room window could not be locked. Also, the in-room safe was small, so that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit in anything bigger than a mid-sized camera. Although the furniture was OK, the general appearance of the hotel was of being in need of a renovation, for example, the carpets were dated and the balcony floor covering was pealing. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool, as we preferred the beach. However, it did not look particularly inviting and there was no pool-side bar, as far as I could gather. Would I stay there again. Probably not.

I'm under 40 so I'm in no way a prude, but the area consisted mostly of young surfers, people with multiple tattoos, etc. One set of washer/dryers were not in working order and the front desk didn't have quarters readily available for those wanting to do laundry (they did quickly run out and pick some up); room service (which is ordered from two local restaurants) left off one of our children's meals. The staff did offer to go back and get it, but 30-40 minutes with hungry child was not worth it so we just shared our meal with him. We also asked to checkout one day early but were told we'd be charged the full rate ($400+) anyway so we stayed.

On the positive side, each room did have a small refrigerator, microwave and hairdryer, and proximity to beach was nice.

We have stayed in San Diego twice before, once at the Welk Estates in Escondito (love it, but only if you're staying for a week or so) and at the Bahia Resort Hotel at Mission Beach - before the reno's. I really wanted to stay here but the price US$450 scared the bejeezers out of me. This trip I was on business and could write off our hotel stay so I jumped at the opportunity. I read lots of reviews that complimented the hotel and since it's #1 in San Diego how could we go wrong. Just after I booked I read the latest review about the area being a dump and I got scared... however there was no going back... We arrived on July 6th at about 4pm... check in was quick and fast thanks to Humberto (Tito), they have parking underneath the hotel for $18 a night which was great because then it's a quick elevator ride to your hotel room. We stayed in a oceanview room on the second floor middle of the hotel. The room was huge, beautifully appointed and comfortable. The balcony was great with an amazing view. The beds are about four and a half feet high with a little step stool to climb up... There is a bar fridge and a mini bar. Never tried the internet but apparently there is wireless... We got changed quickly and ran for the pool (we had just driven up from Ensenada). There was free wine hour from 4 to 5 and lemonade for the kids. The wine was excellent, white, red and blush and the service was great. We had a quick glass on the patio and then changed over to plastic glasses and went for a dip. The pool isn't huge but is adequate for the most part, only occasionally crowded. The hot tub was great and the view of the surfers was fun to watch. The area around the hotel is funky and fun. We walked all over... ate at World Famous the first night and Gringo's the second night. I lost my nose ring and bought one around the corner at the tatoo parlour. We felt completely safe and happy in the area and after eating dinner at World Famous walked back along the beach skipping the surf with the kids at 11pm a night. There were a few homeless people sipping beers, etc. but no one was violent or scary. The beach is beautiful and clean and we met lots of the vendors along the way in their little shops who were so nice and helpful. We ate breakfast at The Broken Yolk on Garnet both mornings... mmm best omelets ever!! Dinner at World Famous was ok, the appy's were great but the main courses were hit and miss, the prime rib was good, the steak not all that interesting. Dinner at Gringo's was ok too.. the appy's were fabulous, however the traditional Mexican food we ordered was not our favorite and we wish we had ordered fajita's instead. At about 11pm on Saturday night there was a little yahoo going on in the pool, it lasted about 15 minutes before hotel staff cleared them out without incident, however it was very loud for a few minutes. We had a problem with dripping water over our vanity. I called the front desk and they sent the repair man, who looked at it and told me he would resolve it while we were out. When we came back it seemed to have be fixed, however overnight the drip came back and our whole vanity was flooded including all our bathroom stuff, it was a big mess. I complained when we checked out and they comp'd our parking so $36 credit, which was nice. So here's our list of pros: - amazing location, fun, hip and interesting - beautiful hotel - fabulous service - great pool area, fun to hang out at - wonderful sandy beach - entertaining watching the surfers - fun boardwalk to walk along - comfy beds/linens - tv was huge and lots of options - small bar fridge (good for leftovers and cold drinks, etc.) - lots of good restaurants/shopping near by (walking distance) List of cons: - very expensive - have to pay for parking - noisy - we didn't mind at all (in fact we like it) but if you're looking for peace and quiet you probably won't find it here between the surf crashing and the people around the pool We never even went into San Diego proper this trip, we loved the Pacific Beach area so much... we visited Sea World on Saturday and that was excellent, however it's a two day excursion with little people and we didn't get to see everything in one day...

Not sure how everybody seems to get such a good rate, but we booked through hotel website at $420 a night! This was our most expensive hotel during a 3 week stay, but certainly not the best.

You can have cereals, small selection of fruit and toasted bagels, It's the same every day and there were never enough bowls etc, so you had to have polystyrene bowls which you are supposed to use if you want to take breakfast to your room. The most disappointing thing is the surrounding area, it's a dump!! The hotel said they had restaurants that you could sign a tab and they would bill the hotel, so that you did not have to carry your wallet around at night, this seems to me its because the area is so dreadful. We were recommended one restaurant by a local chap who got chatting to us outside the hotel, its called Nicks by the beach, very nice food and good service, its about a five block walk. All other nights we drove into the city and went to Seaport Village, about a 15 min drive. It's on the waterfront and has some good restaurants. We also went to La Jolla which is lovely. Wonderful area, great restaurants. Very easy to get to Seaworld and San Diego Zoo, both about 10 - 20mins drive.

Also, it was a great place to sit and drink free wine/lemonade while the sunset. Nice for eating breakfast and even dinner. One night we brought home a pizza from a joint just down the street and ate it on the patio. The staff was amazing. The free breakfast was really good. So good that we never even made it to Kona's for breakfast, and that is our favorite breakfast place in the world! It was very convenient to the beach, and great people watching. the kids loved the free cookies and chocolates. I can't begin to say how wonderful our experience was here!

I can't imagine what those people would like. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Maui and Four Seasons on the Big Island just a couple of months before our SD trip, and it was on par with that experience. Mind you, no one is coming around spritzing you with Evian at the Pacific Terrace like they did at the Four Seasons Maui, but that's a bit much anyway, even for the Four Seasons. And, I'm not saying that the facilities and amenities are equal to the Four Seasons, but the experience was just as good, and it was a fraction of the cost. As for the complaints about the work out facility--who in their right mind would want to work out in a gym when you have miles of paths along the ocean (not to mention the ocean and the beach) literally right out the back door?

They then asked for my cell number and told me he would call me as soon as my room was ready and they did. When we got to our room, it was amazing! Plasma tv, fridge, nice bathroom, remote control fan, oversized comfy beds, IPOD docking station clock and a huge patio with table/chairs and a big seashell. The kids were so excited and my husband was surprised at how nice the hotel was for the price we paid ($199/night). The wine reception (4-5pm)was great and the staff was so helpful and got towels for the kids and offered to go get them fresh cookies in the lobby. They have apples and cookies at 4pm in the lobby and all day they have tea/lemonade and coffee in a room by the pool. While sitting by the warm pool we met several guests who have stayed there for years and called it a \"secret gem\". The ocean was so close and great for the kids. They had a warm shower to use before going back to the pool. The towels were fluffy and warm and they even offered poolside massages (not sure price). There were some women there for a girls weekend and they were lined up and ready to get a massage in the tent. A lot of people walk around in the white robes they provide in the room. The breakfast was great too and they even have highchairs. The staff was so helpful and nice. We ate outside and could see the ocean while eating. The only negative is the noise on the boardwalk if you sleep with your patio door open so we left it open half the night and then closed it when the surfers came at 5am. The AC worked great and drowned out the noise. They also have a computer for anyone to use in the hallway so we got to check our email daily which was nice. They offer a few restaurants for room service but it is pricey so we went down the boardwalk to the Green Flash and ate outside with an ocean view (it was delicious!). Also, the Ralphs grocery store is in walking distance so you can get some snacks/ beverages for your room. We DID NOT use our car the entire time we were there.

Now, I would request this- who wants to sit on a balcony where everyone can see you from the pool area??!!! My one complaint is that we arrived on an early flight from the East Coast and got to the hotel around 11:30am. Although early check in isn't guaranteed, I had hoped a hotel of this nature for $400/night would have made an extra effort to allow us into our room a little early. The front desk clerk suggested we get lunch then come back which we did. However, by 3:30pm our room was still not ready (check in is at 4pm). Had I known we would only have been able to check in 15 minutes early, we would have planned something for the afternoon and/or not stayed in such close proximity to the hotel waiting to check in early. My mistake but slightly disappointing. The beds are extremely comfortable. The bathrobes and turn-down service are a pleasant touch. Even the continental breakfast was above & beyond. The front desk staff and concierge were very helpful and always addressed me by name. This is small, intimate hotel and is not for someone expecting a huge facility with lots of amenities and activities. However, if you're looking for something on the beach and within walking distance to great restaurants and the beach- this is a winner!

We ended up with a room on the first floor to the side of the pool, and although I was hesitant to take it (we've always had a second or third story room) it was FANTASTIC. I will request a pool-facing ground floor room in the future. You get a huge patio area, and lots of foliage provide ample privacy (frankly more private than the balconies IMO). Plus, the ocean view is better from the ground floor as you can actually see it from your room versus going out onto the balcony since you aren't above it only seeing sky. The bed was SO comfy. Really fantastic. The other guests that stay here are always so nice. We buddied up with another family and my kids went swimming every night with their new friends. I noticed this time the hotel was full of families. Last times we stayed here there were many, many, many more people on business. I am not sure why there was a change but it was better for us (more kids and racket at breakfast versus stuffed shirts reading the paper)... Breakfast was great as always and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. Don't miss Kono's down the boardwalk for breakfast one day though.

There are alot of college kids that live in the area. As with any busy/large town, there were occassional homeless people along the Pacific Beach boardwalk.

The balcony had a cafe table and four chairs. LOCATION: Pacific Beach is a surfer community. But even the little bungalows blocks from the beach were over a million dollars or more. The hotel is on the boardwalk above the beach. To the north is a large condo building, then mansions. To the south, condos shops and restaurants. A grocery store and drug store were within walking distance at Grand and Mission Bay. We ate at Gringo's Mexican food and The Green Flash for breakfast served till 3 and fresh sea food. We also ate at Nick's but wouldn't recommend that restaurant. (See my reviews of those restaurants.) Fat Burgers was good too. You could enjoy the room, beach, boardwalk and neighborhood (some interesting shops up Garnet) for a day or two and not have to venture elsewhere, if you didn't want to. PARKING: We took at taxi from the airport (about $23, plus tip) instead of renting a car at first, because they charged for parking at the hotel. But our last day there I rented a car from Enterprise, who came to pick me up and allowed me to return it to a location near the airport when we left. Enterprise gave us a free shuttle ride to the airport. I got the car for less than $30 for a day and was again \"upgraded\" to a midsize car. I was able to park the rental car on the street within a block, sometimes two, of the hotel. The atmosphere of San Diego was very laid back (even the homeless people were more laid back!) In January it was comfortable to be outside near the beach with long sleeves during the day (60s) and a light jacket at night (50s). It was truly a relaxing experience. If I could afford the housing there, I would consider moving there.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montana", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Pacific Terrace\u201d", "Author": "gfdeb", "ReviewID": "UR6647890", "Content": "Based on Trip Advisor reviews, we selected the Pacific Terrace for a recent short stay in San Diego out of hundreds of hotels.

We only had one glitch, which was rectified quickly. The breakfast was good, the pool and hot tub were very clean and well kept. The service was excellent. A quick tip. We booked directly and got a very good deal as the hotel was running specials this time of year. We also didn't go for the pay parking garage. We found parking in the street (for free) and it really seems like a quiet, safe neighborhood. There are lots of surfers around and they gave us much joy as we watched them surf out in the waves. I really don't think you could find better views anywhere else. I would definately book a waterview suite, if you can! It was worth the money. We have no complaints and would love to return someday.

I was fortunate to have landed here. I was upgraded to an ocean-front suite and had a beautiful balcony overlooking the ocean. The room, amenities and overall experience were much better than expected for the price (Expedia had a better pre-pay rate than calling the hotel directly). My favorite perk was easy access to running on a well-lit sidewalk that runs parallel to the ocean (so much better than running on the sand). I was able to have a quick run every morning, enjoy the sunrise and see the surfers starting their day. The run gave me a chance for people-watching (there were some characters singing, playing instruments, hanging out) as well as the diverse group of homes on the water (everything from $6M custom homes to quaint little beach homes). The breakfast was very nice and convenient on my way out every morning. The only challenge (which appears to be everywhere in this area) wa the lack of quick cab service. There are not cabs lined up in front of the hotel and it can take up to 20 minutes to have a cab show up.

Our experience parallels the reviews of many of the prior guests. it is a great place to stay!! Let's get this one out of the way right off ... Yes, our shower leaked a bit, but only if we weren't observant. The doors swing from the walls, meeting in the middle of the tub opening. It is great for getting in and out of the tub, but can leak if you don't get the doors closed in the correct sequence over the side of the tub. This did not ruin our stay. The staff is indeed friendly. We arrived early and were given access to the pool area and general facilities while we waited. Being a holiday week, we did not get an upgrade, but were pleasantly surprised by the view from our 'partial ocean view' room. (see photos) It may be that since we arrived early, we may have gotten the two prime POV rooms that were available. Our room was larger than the room that our kids had because theirs lost some of the footprint to the stairwell. This is something you may want to watch for even in the second floor Ocean View rooms. The breakfast was sufficient and ample, but lacked any form of protein other than yogurt. The selection of scones, muffins, pastries, cereal and fresh fruit should keep most appetites at bay for the morning. It was very nice to not have to get up, get dressed and go find breakfast. There is an interesting, reasonalby priced breakfast stand just down the walkway from the hotel that had people lined up out the door each day. The grounds are very well kept and groomed. The pool and spa are very well maintained and their are plenty of towels by the pool and in baskets by the rooms that can be used from until the rooms are serviced. Our only complaints regard a few details in the room ... a noisy AC system fan that was irritating, plantation shutters that were not properly installed and didn't slide well and a few needed paint touch ups. It appeared that the room had recently had some rennovations that just weren't well finished. It was obvious that new carpet had just been installed in the stairway, so upgrades are in process. Also, the bell on the elevator door is really annoying! The 42\" plasma TV was so good that even my wife enjoyed watching it. You do get a bit of price break on tickets to major attractions by booking through the concierge. When we go back, and we will go back, we will upgrade to an Ocean View room.

Turn down service is nice, if you like that. Beautiful sunset view. Nice warm outdoor shower for those returning from the beach. Good spa services available. Fun to watch surfers from balcony. Cons: Surrounding neighborhood is rundown and sketchy for walking at night -- safe, but not nice (ex. young men sharing a joint on the sidewalk, many vagrants). Very urban. Not a lot of familes walking around at night. (Boardwalk area OK during the day. Lots of joggers. ) Housekeeping was pleasant but not thorough; did not remove our trash every day even when full. Parking is $15/day billed automatically. Your responsibility to ask them to remove the charges if you don't use garage. We used the free parking in the alley. My strongest dislike was having to go to the garage to use guest laundry. Very isolated area. Neutral: Breakfast is OK, all carbs (cereals, pastries, fruit). Wine hour is nice but wine is low end (you get what you pay for when it's free). No snacks available; bring your own. Jr suites are significantly larger than 2 bedded rooms. Beach chairs available for $5/day. They are extremely heavy and awkward. Supply own lightweight chair, if possible. Beach can be very windy. Some good restaurants but not a large number of family oriented places. Definitely the surfer bar part of town. Try Kafe' Zen for great Thai food. Many restaurants deliver to hotel. This hotel could use its own restaurant. Overall, I just loved it and would love to return. I know I listed some cons, but I wanted to be thorough.

The giant flat screen TV had my husband in awe as he watched a baseball game. Now he wants one at home! The continental breakfast was quite generous and very good: about a dozen dry cereals to choose from, milk, assorted juices, tea and fresh brewed coffee, better-quality pastries, a variety of fresh fruit including cut melons, bagels, muffins, bread, and even peanut butter and cream cheese to use as spreads. The pool and hot tub were cleaned and serviced every morning and just the right temperature. There were always clean towels, including long lounge chair towels, right beside the pool. It was such fun to sit in the hot tub and watch the skaters on the path and the surfers on the beach. The staff was very attentive about keeping the pool area clean and tidy. During the 4-5pm wine reception you could even take a glass of wine (served in a special plastic glass) with you to the pool or hot tub. Don't be alarmed by the older apartment complexes sandwiched between the hotel and the main drag of Mission Blvd. They look a little seedy compared to the sparkling Pacific Terrace Hotel, but seem to be inhabited by mostly laid-back surfer types.

(the price is getting to be almost over the top to but worth it to a point. The pool area is always clean and like new and the continental breakfast is a real meal (not just bagels and coffee) with plenty of room to sit by the pool to enjoy while you read the SD union paper provided every morning and a great view of the ocean from the pool area. The surrounding locations provide a real variety of food and attractions. (You have to eat at the Green Flash, the food is great and affordable).

My new wife and I spent the final 3 days of our honeymoon from 18th - 21st September at Pacific Terrace and it exceeded all our expectations. We picked the PT after reading all the good things written about it on Trip Advisor and to be honest because of all the ravings I had a sneaky feeling it would be a bit of a disappointment. You know what I mean.......when you expect something to be so good, it's always a let down. After a horrible overnight flight from a fantastic week in Hawaii and an extremely irritating 4 hour drive from LAX, we pulled up at Pacific Terrace. We had not slept for over 24 hours and must have looked like the living dead..........we certainly felt like it! However from the moment we stepped inside, we were made to feel so comfortable and welcome, we knew this place was different from most hotels. Our room was to die for - it was huge. We had paid for a Deluxe Ocean View Room, but randomly got upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View Suite. It was fantastic. The bed was so comfortable, the massive HD ready Plasma TV unbelievable, the bar and kitchen area (which we were not expecting at all) were great and the balcony and view were spectacular. The pool area, although small, was more than adequate for the size of the hotel and was so well looked after. If you're around the pool area at 4.00pm each afternoon, a trolley gets wheeled out with a complimentary selection of wine for guests. I thought what a nice touch to be given something for nothing; a glass of wine would be lovely. Four glasses later, I thought it was an even nicer touch!! However, all these things said, the thing that really puts this hotel in a league of its own is the staff. I've stayed in a lot of different accommodations in my time and I can without hesitation say these guys were the best. Not only were they so very helpful and efficient, but their general manor and friendliness was really heart warming. I cannot put it into words, but I'm sure everyone else who's stayed here will back me up, they are just really genuinely lovely people. From the maids, to the room service, to the reception staff - absolutely everyone was fantastic. I 've always fancied going to San Diego and had lots of things planned to end off our 3 week honeymoon. However, we were so comfortable in the Pacific Terrace, we did nothing..........and didn't feel bad about doing nothing! This place was so awesome, it just seemed appropriate to chill out and enjoy our last few days in peace.

First of all, my wife and I were vacationing with our two children ages 4.5 and 6. A 'Welcome' email from the hotel was received a day prior to our arrival, suggesting we prepare for relaxation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a nice way to begin. Our 5 pm check-in was smooth, especially for the busy holiday weekend. The staff at the front desk was courteous, professional and efficient. The bellman, Rich, was particularly helpful in pointing out all of the features of the property (pool, breakfast/wine hour, parking, etc.) and our stunning room. We booked an executive suite as it was the only way to GUARANTEE that we receive a room with two queen beds. Premium ocean view and Jr. suites are offered with both King/sofa bed or 2 queen configurations and while the hotel tries to accommodate all requests there are no guarantees. The room exceeded our expectations. Out third floor suite was very spacious and nicely appointed. Notable amenities: 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd plasma TV, large double sliding doors w/ plantation shutters, ocean view patio w/ seating for four, wet bar w/ microwave. The bathroom was exceptionally large and had a jetted tub. The room was clean and well cared for. Our room was located on the north side of the hotel facing the Capri and the ocean. Rooms on the south side look out toward Crystal Pier. There was enough noise at street level that we chose to close the sliders at night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if the rooms that directly face the ocean would be quieter as they are adjacent to the pool, beach and beach walk. The pool facility was appropriately sized for the hotel. Pool and hot tub were heated to 85 and 104 deg. respectively. There were no age restrictions for the hot tub. I believe the hours were 7-10 a.m. Seating was adequate and towels plentiful. Additional shade seating would be nice. This is NOT the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsend your nanny down in the morning to reserve a lounge chair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pool scene. Very relaxed and laid back. Deluxe continental breakfast is served from 7-10am and is well stocked and plentiful. Pastries, bagels, cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, juice, coffee, tea and milk are offered. Seating is cozy inside or one can dine outside near the pool. It seemed that most guests took advantage of the complimentary breakfast. Iced tea and lemonade are available throughout the day as are an assortment of board games. Complementary wine hour is from 4-5 p.m. by the pool. The hotel DOES NOT have a restaurant or pool side bar service, however, there is fare from two local restaurants to choose from for room service or pool side delivery. Guests are also able to charge back to their room at several other nearby restaurants. Location is ideal. The hotel is located in Pacific Beach just north of Crystal Pier and shares an oceanfront location next to the Capri By The Sea condominiums. Beach access is just out the secured gates. Activities are plentiful. There are several restaurants nearby and worthy of mentioning: The Fishery, PB at Cass and Opal (.8 mile from hotel), an inland neighborhood eatery (no ocean view) delicious, FRESH seafood. Station Sushi, Solana Beach, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up north (and returning to the hotel from Legoland) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth the stop. Great hotel staff recommendation! Taco Surf, PB, Mission Boulevard between Felspar and Emerald, GREAT taco eatery just a block away. Take-out for pool-side dining. I would not recommend Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Service was slow, food mediocre and ambiance just so-so. The fitness room was under construction and was going to be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery small\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 according to staff. We did not utilize any offsite fitness facility. Parking located beneath the hotel was adequate and secure; I believe it was $17 a night. The hotel also provided 10 first-come first-serve spaces in the alley behind the hotel at no charge. Surface/street parking is difficult due to the desirable beach location. Hotel checkout is 11 a.m. I had inquired about a late checkout when I booked our room two months prior to our stay and was told it would not be a problem, so I booked a late returning flight to Reno to maximize our stay. However, this request was denied the night before our departure due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunusually high amount of room turnover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. In the end, we were extended until noon and were able to use all the hotel facilities (less the room) until 3 p.m. So what cold be done better? Tough question. There were a few noticeable exterior \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwear and tear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 marine environment issues (peeling paint, rusty metal) that could be repaired. A small pool side bar might be nice to aid in relaxation. One or two of the staff seemed overwhelmed by the demands and volume of guests and were neither helpful nor responsive to guest requests\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6find replacements ASAP that are truly dedicated to guest service.

Wide screen HDTV, queen beds, upgraded decor, but the selling point is the view! Get oceanview for the few dollars more per night and you won't regret it. No need to pay for the underground parking, though. Wide variety for the FREE continental breakfast, and if you've ever paid for a meal in SD, then you can appreciate this perk. The staff was great, not intrusive or overly friendly, just there when you need them. That's perfect service in my opinion. No hotel dining is not a problem. Just walk a few short blocks to any kind of food you want. Pacific Beach is a fun place to stay and the PT is BY FAR the best hotel in the area.

I was pleased with the amenities we had in our room: free wireless internet, fridge, coffe pot, and mini-bar, 2 sinks, very handicap accessible bathroom, patio and chairs outside by a little garden area, 2 very comfortable queen beds, a desk and chair plus a little table and more chairs. We were very happy. While there was no restaurant onsite, we liked the free continental breakfast in the morning. We had lots to eat there. Plus there were drinks available there all day for free. Snacks and drinks were available by the heated outdoor pool. From 4-5 pm was a free wine hour. There were tons of restaurants nearby to chose from after our busy day.

The rooms are very nice and upscale. Staff is very friendly and helpful and create a very laid back atmosphere. They offer a small complimentary continental breakfast every morning which is nice. It is not a trendy hotel. So, if you are looking at a place to be seen this is not it. Yes, there are sufers, college kids, and bums that hang out on the beach. I've never had a problem with any of them but if they bother you then go out to Coronado or La Jolla. This hotel has been great for our kids as the small pool is warm and not very crowded. It is does not have an onsite restaurant or bar. So, if you want 4 star service while sitting by the pool then this is not the place. If you don't mind walking down the beach to dinner or bars then this is not a problem as there are many. Also, we have 3 small kids and there are many walk up fast food places very close if you don't feel like a formal dinner. I would also say the entire Pacific/Mission Beach area is pretty laid back. There aren't any 5 star restaurants within walking distance. There are many decent places to eat but you have to go to Gaslamp or downtown for the trendy places. The area is definitely on the upswing with real estate booming. It is also much more exciting than La Jolla or Coronado, which are good for shopping, but pretty boring IMHO other than that. The beach at the hotel is great. There is some seaweed around whereas Coronado keeps the beach pretty clean. There is also a 2-4 foot break for body surfing.

It was very clean, plenty of piping hot water and the beds were sooo comfy. We thought the breakfast provided was way above average - plenty of cereals to choose from, fresh fruit and fresh croissants/bagels danish etc. There were also plenty of highchairs - clean ones with working harnesses!! If you choose to get breakfast out there is an abumdance of eateries along the boardwalk (and it's only a 5 min walk to Starbucks!). There's also a great supermarket there where you can pick up supplies to store in your refrigerator. At 4pm-5pm there was complimentary wine tasting which was a lovely touch, there was hot water and coffee provided all day (just help yourself) and cookies at the front desk. Unlike others, we found the $15 a day parking convenient. We could load the kids up easily in the underground parking and did not have to fight for street parking. The key card worked every time so no problems there. The pool area was spotless - even though the weather was unusually cool when we were there, we could still swim and even take the baby in. The beach was a bit grubby and there was a lot of seaweed but we didn't really want to go down there anyway; the view however is beautiful - a lovely sunset most evenings and we even saw dolphins playing off the end of the pier. Yes, there are a few down and outs who \"live\" along the boardwalk, but all were friendly and non-threatening and it did not put us off wandering along the boardwalk each evening for a stroll with the kids. If you enjoy running, this is a great place to exercise and join the many other runners who seemed to be out all day. This is a wonderful accommodation - we think it's one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in (and we've stayed in some pretty swanky hotels). It's small, quiet, the staff are incredibly helpful and efficient and it's very well positioned. We went out every day and the longest we were in the car was on the journey up to Legoland (40 mins). By the way, the hotel has a brilliant sheet with detailed directions to all the major sights. We didn't need a map or even a guidebook - it was all provided for us.

The Premium Ocean View rooms very spacious and nicely decorated. Althought the hotel seemed quite booked, it felt very quiet and except for the waves on the beach couldn't really hear anything. The pool area is very small, but we spent there only little time, as we wanted to explore the area. The complimentary breakfast is not really the best in the world, but at least it is complimentary and if you are not a big breafast eater you get the things you want (cereal, fruit, bagels, jam, juice, tea, coffee). The breakfast room however is VERY small and can't accommodate all guests staying in the hotel. We took our breakfast to our room and sat on the balcony, which was very nice. The free wine tasting in the afternoon (also free lemonade) was a nice add on to our stay. There are a few complimentary parking spaces next to the hotel. Alternatively they offer underground parking for $15 per day, but we always found some parking on the street. Personally we were not so keen on the near by area of the hotel. There are lots of bars and restaurants, but most of them not really to our taste. But we went to downtown San Diego (Gaslamp district), which is only about 20 minutes away and found fantastic restaurants and bars. We also went one evening for a meal in La Jolla, but it was very quiet there. Maybe because it was off season (after the school holidays). A nice bar/restaurant near the hotel is \"Jrdans\" (5 minutes). We liked the hotel so much, that we actually wanted to extend our stay over the weekend, but they were fully booked.

I would love it even more if they restricted too large of groups and even more appealing would be an adults only (nothing weird) romantic kind of hideaway for romance and relaxation.

Very helpful and friendly staff on the front desk at check-in. In fact all the staff I met, whatever their role at the hotel, where friendly and helpful. If you have a car secure underground parking is $15 per night (I think on a first come basis, we didn't have a car). There is some street parking, but follow the advice of the front desk as to where as I did hear her telling one guest that they do ticket every night in some places. We booked an Executive Suite. This room was enormous! We had 2 king beds with a pillow top mattress type thing that was very comfortable. A sofa, 2 easy chairs, coffee table, desk & chair, 'proper' size dining table and chairs for 4 people. The kitchenette consisted of a sink, fridge, microwave, 3 elec ring stove top with small oven, coffee machine plus plates, cutlery, glasses etc and pots and pans. My only minor quibble is the TV angled towards the beds, rather than the sofa, which meant I tended to drop-off to sleep on that very inviting bed of an evening and miss the end of whatever I was watching! The bathroom was also huge with a 2 person jacuzzi, seperate shower stall and seperate WC also. The wardrobe is in the bathroom which sort of turns this room into a dressing-room. Lots of towels and toiletries and they topped up the toiletries each day too - not a thing that always happens. Lovely soap! There is a phone and TV in the bathroom. Two nice terry robes too. Each evening, around 6.15/6.30pm, housekeeping would arrive and turn back the beds, leave chocolates on the pillow, draw the curtains, turn on the side lamps and leave the radio playing music for your return. We had a big balcony that had a sideways view up to the coast towards La Jolla. We stayed in 325. If you could get room 322 to 324 you would have an even better view. This side of the hotel you also get to see the sunset. There are ocean front rooms, these were all reserved for our dates, which I am sure are wonderful. Personally I prefer the side we were on if going for a side view (rather than the side views to Cyrstal Pier) for that sunset of an evening. The huge sliding windows to the balcony also have those 'net shutters' that mean you can leave the doors half-open for air but get no visiting bugs. Not that I saw any bugs, but a nice touch. Sitting on our peaceful balcony of a morning gazing at the Pacific, the surfers and joggers/walkers etc was hard to beat. I was travelling with just carry-on and my 10-yr-old so when I discovered there was a guest laundry down in the car park I was happy. Any Mother's reading this will relate! It's $1.25 per wash in quarters (front desk keep change), $1.25 per dryer (45 mins) and for soap and fab con. They also offer the usual laundry services.The Longs Drugstore on Mission (about 5/10 mins walk) also sell travel sizes of laundry detergent etc. The included buffet breakfast was more than adequate and you can take it up to your room if you prefer. There is a flat rate $10 charge to have breakfast delivered to your room. There was every type of cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, endless pastries (muffins, croissants, scones, danish, bagels etc) preserves and spreads and all the usual beveragas (hot and cold). Between 5 and 6pm there's a free wine hour. Nice to take a glass and sit by the outdoor pool. The pool and spa face the boardwalk and beach, loungers by the pool and tables and chairs around the outer area. Lovely spot to sit - or swim if you like. Each guest gets a 'pool towel' card. Location wise I loved it! We could walk to the beach, restaurants and shops. Remember we had no car. There's a Ralph's supermarket on Mission about 10 mins walk away, as well as the Longs Drugs, for whatever supplies you might want. There's a post office at the corner of Emerald & Cass - we had to mail some purchases home! Longs sell packaging materials as does the post office. The No.9 bus (direct to Seaworld) leaves from the corner of Diamond and Faneul. About 15 mins walk along a safe residential street. Not sure what parking costs at SW but the bus is a good option if you need it. $1.75 per person each way. The bus is quite regular in both directions and there is always a printed timetable you can take from near the driver's seat. Cab fare to SW is about $13 each way with a tip.

A public parking lot was next to our room, but we didn't have any bothersome noise. (And we're really picky about excessive noise. If we're on vacation, we want peace and quiet!) Rooms directly overlooking the pool and ocean are located in the center of the hotel. Outstanding service from employees. Everyone smiling, polite and helpful at every turn. Special touches include: (all complimentary) beverage/coffee bar, wine hour continental breakfast and morning newspaper. Beautiful hotel grounds made the views from the warm pool and jacuzzi even more enjoyable. Attentive drink service at the pool. After seeing the other hotel choices in Pacific Beach, there is absolutely no other choice than Pacific Terrace Hotel. Underground parking is $15/day, with unlimited usage.

The facilities are nice -- they are the most spectacular by any means -- but it's a beach hotel -- it's expected. What makes this hotel so special is the staff. Before arriving to San Diego for Valentine's weekend, I spoke with the concierge many, many times about wanting champagne in the room, Sea World tickets, a tour to Tijuana ... she was always happy to talk to me and recognized my voice immediately and called me by name. I talked to her A LOT and she not once seemed impatient or frustrated with me -- she truly wanted to help me. Upon checking in, I found that the great service did not end there. While clearly waiting for the concierge, a front desk staff member came up to me and asked if there were something she could help me with -- clearly going out of her way so that I didn't have to wait any longer (...and she could help me). I asked an employee where we could great breakfast upon check-out (4:30a.m. -- long before the continental breakfast opened) and she took our \"order\" made us each a separate \"breakfast bag\" with fruit, muffins, cereal, and juice and had it ready for us upon check-out. Each time I entered the hotel I was greeted by name and was asked how my dinner was or how my trip to Tijuana was ... they really seemed to KNOW me and were interested in my day's activities. They followed up with everything - suggested things before I asked them - they seemed to know what I wanted and did it without me having to ask them. This truly is a special hotel. I make a point of mentioning the staff because it is the staff that makes it truly unique.

The pool is very clean, and so is the jacuzzi. Your room card allows you to get straight out onto the boardwalk and then you just have to walk down the steps to get to the beach.

We wanted to go to San Diego Zoo for a day trip and the staff printed us out bus timetables and a map so we could get there in the quickest time possible. The breakfast was mainly breads and pastries, which was ok. We had two double beds in our room, and the room itself was immaculate. We had a chocolate left on our bed every night and the beds were turned down. Each morning when we got up there was a paper left outside our room.

And what a surprise - it was great! just in front of the swimming pool, facing directly the ocean, far enough from the breakfast room (which gets busy), with a nice little patio. We stayed and made the most of a beautiful holiday. The best thing for us, was that we could open the French doors into the patio and let the kids play (quietly!). The swimming pool is fenced so we didn't have to worry about them getting close to it. We really enjoyed the staff, the breakfast, the wine reception, the location, and the room - which came with a small kitchen. We also realized that there aren't many rooms at all which don't have an ocean view as all the rooms are facing south, north or west - None of them face east. The only thing I would get a bit worried about is with the ones facing north, as they didn't seem to get any sunshine what so ever.

The rooms all have bathrobes and slippers, which is a cute touch. You can buy the bathrobes for a price, which my friend did. The free breakfast is good--lots to choose from and you can take it outside on the patio with tables/umbrellas. As two women traveling alone we never felt scared or nervous walking the boardwalk at night. The boardwalk takes you right to some good restaurants. I will have to say parking is a problem. There are only a few 'reserved' spots for guests (without paying). A few times we had to park down the block when returning at night. But that's a small thing to deal with when you wake up to the ocean outside your balcony door!

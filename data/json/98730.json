And my room is always spotless, definately making me comfortable it is thoroughly cleaned. Not just a quick sweep theough i feel at some hotels. The location is great for me, convenient to my office but also easy to get to so many fun restaurants and shopping areas. I went to the west village on this last trip. It was so close and so fun.

I'm calling this review heartbreak hotel because it represented a step down from previous HHs I've stayed at in the past. What made the hotel a heartbreak was its dismal state. It seems to have been worn down by many visitors. The rug in my room was frayed, there was a pervasive smell in the hallway and the room, and the ice machine on my floor was continuously broken my entire stay. I didn't use the hotel restaurant, but I did use the fitness room It has adequate facilities. I say adequate because some of the equipment was broken (tv on treadmill and at least one of the treadclimers, tread on treadmill loose). I'm glad they had something to help me unwind at the end of a busy day anyway. The biggest area in need of improvement is housekeeping. When I checked in, my bath and bedding was covered with random hairs. I left a note for housekeeping requesting linen changes and they took care of the problem the next day. On the third day of my stay, I noticed gum on the carpet just outside one of the elevators on my floor. After many hours of it not being addressed, I went down to the front desk to report it. Next morning, the gum was still there, but most of it removed by late afternoon. Unfortunately, remnants of the gum remained until I departed two days later. Throughout my stay, dishes left outside rooms after room service stayed in the hallway for many hours and sometimes overnight. Despite some of the negatives, this hotel did brisk business. From entry until exit, the staff was always gracious, helpful, and in good spirits. They made staying at the hotel a joy. The hotel is near a medical complex, a trade center, and off a major highway and near public transportation (the train ran right by my room); a good location. The clientele were varied. There are few restaurants in the area, but a bit of variety (diner, sushi, Italian, fast food) within a one-mile radius. Despite some of things that need improvement, this hotel was a pleasant place to stay because of the atmosphere if nothing else.You can tell when people are really trying to do their best and that's what the hotel staff represented above all.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgeport, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat chef\u201d", "Author": "Ted W", "ReviewID": "UR126268809", "Content": "One of the best stays ever.

I read a Trip Advisor Review from a guest who said his room was cold. He continued to say regardless of what the Thermostat was set on, the temp or heat would not rise. I thought this was an isolated problem that I surely would not have to experience. The Temp in the 'first' room we entered on the 5th Floor was cool, and set on 72. We ran the setting to 85, but the unit continued blowing 'cool' air. Thinking about the above mentioned review, I went down to the desk to request a Blanket. The attendant seemed shocked that the room had no heat; but his response was \"are you in a King room\" I said yes, and he asked would you like another room, I said yes. So they moved me around the corner. Thinking ahead I came into this room to set the thermostat so it would begin to get comfortable for our return, & Increased the setting to 85. Upon our regrouping to the 'new' room, I noticed that the temp was still cool and I increased the temp to the max, put my hand over the vent and felt cool air. So we turned the unit off. We are still cool and even with the requested thin blanket, we slept cool. I tried to call my Wife in the old room to tell her to gather up our things. I called to the old room twice, but she said she heard no signal or anything after answering the phone. Now in our new room the phone is silent. Some hotels deactivate phones when the room is empty to keep housekeeping from using them, perhaps due to their inattentiveness they failed to activate our phone. I do not know.

This visit was one more case where reading the reviews of other travelers prepared me for my stay. My priority is that the rooms and property are clean and safe. This Holiday Inn was better than the average Holiday Inn. Based on my visit, I recommend this hotel to other travelers. Parkland Hospital is nearby. The hotel offers free transportation within a 5 mile radius if conferences are in those locations. My room was small but clean, neat and reasonably updated. Nothing fancy but okay. No smoke or perfume smell. Clean. Neat. Parking lot has dark areas. Most guests avoided the dark areas. The staff was professional and courteous. Housekeeping in my room was excellent. While I did not eat in the dining area, there were many who did. There was a diner across the street which is the only food service nearby. Many cars were there. The train station is about a 15 minute walk south of the hotel and Parkland Hospital is about a 20 to 30 minute walk. The metro train runs very close behind the building. Train horn sounded about every hour on the weekend until about 9pm at night and trains until about 10:30 at night. The beds were firm but not hard. The blankets were used by everyone. I prefer the sheet layer with the blanket in the middle, but these were the only blanket on the top. The TV was flat screen. The bathrooms were small but a small dressing area made it bigger. My toilet was slow to flush which I attributed to the age of the building. None of these occurrences discouraged me. The meeting rooms were smaller than other Holiday Inns. The pool area was an okay size with chairs and extra towels. The fitnes room was up to date. The parking area is large but spread out. The building is curved which makes the rooms the slight shape of an angle. This was a Days Inn which explains why this is not a typical Holiday Inn structure. Weekend breakfast buffet is $12.95 per person. . Dinner runs about $18.00 per person. Shortly after arriving, I received a call from the staff about my satisfaction with the room. A wine glass from a previous guest was left outside my door prior to my arrival. I asked that it be picked up and 24 hours later, the glass was still there. I moved the glass to the table in front of the elevator and it was picked up. I guess this is how they handle room service cleanup in full service hotels in Dallas:-) I would stay here again and recommend it to others.

We call the front desk to request air freshener and to tell them about the wet floor. They responded quickly and send housekeeping and maintenance to the room. After a check and half a can of air freshener we were offered another room, the room next door. We get everything packed up and walk in to ahhh a new room....that smells worse than the first. Smoking in the room could only help the room smell! I go immediately to the front desk to request yet a third room. I explain the smell and that there is something seriously wrong and that maintenance need to investigate the rooms then they need to be cleaned and aired out. I was asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, but I tell the nice young lady that I only want a non smelling room. They give us a room in a different area of the hotel. Now I understand that sometimes things happen or break, until.... this morning as we were leaving for the day we walk past the front desk to hear another guest complaining about the smell in their room, room 410. Then we start checking some online reviews and we find that the smell has been an ongoing problem. Instead of fixing the problem, they continue to put guests into rooms that have issues in hope that they will stumble across a guest that won't complain. That is not right. Either address the issue and clean the room from top to bottom after it is fixed or don't use the rooms. The restaurant was a little high on the prices and not really that good, at least for dinner. we did not have breakfast. The rooms are good size and the shower is ok.

October 10-12 2008. We were very late checking in, so I called ahead and spoke with a nice lady named allison who was able to check me in over the phone so I didn't have to worry about it when we got to the desk. Check in was at 3 and we didn't arrive until about 10 or 11 at night. We arrived and allison had told me to present my card to the desk and they'll take care of me as I did what I was told, the man there swore he didnt see my name in the system and made me feel a little dumb for not mentioning the fact that I had already been checked in and that I just needed my room keys. He had borderline attitude, but I was up working since very early morning and did not want to deal with him so I just let it slide. Staff needs to be happy at all times. The problem was quickly solved though. There is a bit of construction going on right now in that area, so be careful. The room was a little less than what I expected for the price. The televisions were nice and the room was spacious. Everything was clean. I think they could have chosen a color other than brown for a bathroom. It came off a little dirty but it wasn't. I dont like the fact that whoever will be next in the room will eventually see that their maintenance person stuffed a cardboard piece in the shower handle to hold the screw in. It was soggy by the time we checked out so someone will have to deal with a water leak soon. If you are in town on a big event weekend, I suggest getting a suite and requesting or bringing ear plugs. After very long work days, I had to hear shouting from the football fans across the halls. We were in the corner so we were grateful for that. Again, too tired to mention it to staff. We ordered breakfast to the room which was about 8 dollars per person and we appreciated that they offered milk and juice along with eggs cooked as you like them with potatoes fried in bell and red peppers. Very tasty and filling for the price. I requested a 930am delivery and they were right on time. I was very impressed. We also had phone troubles and my husband called the front desk for help and said he would go down there to make the call, but before he could get out the door, room service was knocking on our door to help him. Also very impressed. I wish I could have gotten his name and I wish we carried cash, otherwise we would have given him a tip for being so patient, professional, and courteous. A great man, whoever he was. The only negative part of our trip was the morning of checkout. We were getting ready to shower and it was about 10am when we hear three knocks on the door and all of a sudden the door opens. I am naked at this point and have to run to the bathroom because I felt like they were trying to come in the room. We heard no \"room service\" or anything like that. Our bill, along with another person's bill was then slid under the door. We travel quite a bit and this is the first time this has happened. usually, they will just slide it under the door. What happened was unacceptable. I highly suggest management has a serious talk with their staff about entering rooms because I know alot of people including ourselves, who travel with handguns legally. Announce yourself when you knock. That was all we ask. My husband spoke with someone from the front desk to save a space for us for our car but the message was never delivered to the next shift so when we got to the hotel room at around midnight no one knew about our reserved space. So the nice security guard walked my husband outside to show him his car and told him he would park him under the security camera overnight. That man was very helpful and considerate to our needs. The lady at the check out desk heard about our experience and though I didnt feel it was necessary, she deducted a night's stay from the visit. Im the type of person who doesnt ask for discounts. If there is a problem, just dont let it happen again. She was very very understanding and sincere and whoever she was, we appreciate it. The thing that stood out was the fact that while we were explaining ourselves, she never once looked away, she kept her eye contact, and she let us talk before she put her opinion in. Even though the bad stuff happened, the lady at check out kind of wrapped up our total feelings of the place. She left a lasting positive impression on us because she made us feel like we werent taking up her time. We usually stay at higher end hotels, so we expect great service. For the money, this hotel met and even exceeded some of our expectations.

The stay was perfect. The atmostphere was up to date and beautiful. Everything was very clean. Bathrooms include granite counter tops. Check in was very quick as was check out.

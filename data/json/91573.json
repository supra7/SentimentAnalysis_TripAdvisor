Flat panel TV. Bed linens were clean and crisp, large fluffy towels and spa quality soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion provided in single use dispensers. Gormet coffee and teas with an in-room coffee maker. Iron/board and hairdryer in working order. Room service was available and there was a restaurant on site. The bar was very inviting, lively, not overpriced. These are the things that I feel classify a hotel in the four star range. There were a few areas that needed refreshed- the carpet and wallpaper in the hallways of some floors had seen better days; there was some rust around the drain in the shower; minor chips in the vanity, but I find that to be just normal wear and tear in a busy hotel. Self-parking in a connected garage was $18, an average parking fee for the city. The location is not in the center of downtown, but It certainly is within a mile or so walking distance to Mass Ave, the zoo, the canal and some downtown attractions, without having the central downtown price tag. (example, from hotel to Murat Theatre was a pleasant 20 min walk.)

NO. Especially if you plan to eat or drink at a nice restaurant downtown. What this hotel does make up for in location is a speedy shuttle with friendly service. I think the fact they will pick you up at just about any location including the mass ave. area is great. I tipped the driver each time because he was so speedy and friendly and I appreciated the door to door service. The doorman / valet was extremely helpful and friendly on check-in and even ran up to the front door and opened it for my wife and he seemed genuinely happy to provide good service for the hotel patrons. I watched him while waiting for the shuttle and he was very friendly to all guests. The girl at the front desk was nice and gave us an upgrade because either our room wasn't ready or we insisted on a non-smoking room, either way we were happy. The upgraded room actually had a pretty good view of downtown and the size a bit larger than a standard room. The one complaint would be the TV was a bit small for the distance to the bed but for the ten minutes I turned it on it wasn't a big deal. We only ate breakfast at Chancellor's in the morning and the food was excellent. I read a few bad comments about the food but don't hesitate to try the breakfast. I think the price was fair also. The sports bar was pretty good the bartender on duty seemed friendly and would make strong drinks. Personally I prefer a perfectly mixed drink but I think the younger clientele may want more bang for the buck. Nothing good or bad to say about the sports bar just went in for a nightcap.

We ended up eating breakfast at the Hospital cafeteria across the street. There are no restaurants nearby which leads to the final problem - the so called free Shuttle service. Several times they made a point of referencing their free shuttle to downtown. The waits are long and the pick ups very sporadic. We ended up having to cab it downtown. When I called for a return pickup after dinner told me it would arrive shortly. Downstairs the bellman it left 5 minutes earlier. A call to the hold and a long hold later we were told one was on the way. It never showed. I called again and after a hold was told they would call me back. Never called. I called again and learned they were trying to line up a shuttle. We ended up taking a cab again and then 45 minutes later while we're in bed they call to ask if we're still waiting for the shuttle. Rooms are pleasant, lobby is large for meeting with friends but they don't have the customer in mind at this place. If you get this one on a blind draw it's tolerable, if you're staying here ahead of a hospital visit it's convenient but if you're here for downtown - I'd look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCharge $18/day for self-park and $24 for valet\u201d", "Author": "BusyTraveling36990", "ReviewID": "UR94737511", "Content": "This not so special hotel charges higher than average prices.

Hotel is very nice, very large, very plush. There is an attached second story covered walkway that takes you...... to the outer wall of the IU Medical Center...... yes, that is right, it takes you to the outside of the IU Med Center, not into the building. There is an elevator at the IU Med Center end of the walkway, take note if you have an early morning appointment at IU, the elevator does not operate around the clock. I think it starts running around 7 am. Either way, once you get to the ground floor, you will need to walk about 100 feet to the IU Med Center entrance. Seems like connecting the end of the walkway to the hotel itself and allowing you to walk into the second floor of the hospital would have been prudent for all concerned? The wouldn't have needed an elevator for the walkway at all. If you park at the hospital and walk through the walkway into the hotel, be advised, there are no markings to tell you which way to go to find the desk. If you do this, turn right as soon as you pass the edge of the wall, look for the huge stair case heading down or look to the right again for the elevators, go down to the ground floor and you wiil see the desk as you exit the elevators or arrive at the bottom of the stairs. If your appointment is early, you will either have to walk down two flights of stairs or walk out the front of the hotel and across the street, up the drive to get to the IU Med Center entrance. The hotel was nice enough to send a valet to pick up a wheelchair the morning of the surgery to get the patient across the road quickly (very cold that morning). They were asked about that the evening before and assured us they would have the wheelchair at the front desk at 5:30 am for us, it either wasn't there or it was locked up and they didn't have an access key. Oh, the fire alarm at 4:30 would have been aggravating also, if we hadn't planned on getting up at that time to get ready for the day. Evidently, the cold weather routinely sets off the fire alarm in the winter season? Plan on taking your own alarm clock or using the wake up service, the alarm in the room was off an hour (must not automatically adjust for daylight savings time?) and even though I am pretty good at figuring out digital settings, I gave up trying to set the time on this one. You can always set your alarm off an hour like I did, easier to just use your cell phone alarm. Other than those few oddities, the hotel was very nice. When we arrived and realized we didn't know where to go to check in, we called the hotel number (luckily we had that number in our phone) and they graciously sent someone to retrieve us and guide us to the desk.

I'd taken a risk and chosen an \"unnamed\" four star hotel for on Expedia.com for a deal. After paying, the name was revealed, so I came here to check out the reviews, and many of them were negative. After reading through these reviews, I thought I'd made a big mistake, but since it was a non-refundable purchase, I planned to just make the best of it. Maybe it's because I went there expecting the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this hotel was an excellent place to stay. When we first arrived, at least I knew about the parking fee ahead of time from reading the reviews. We went ahead and parked our own car, and took the conveniently located elevators which delivered us right to the lobby. (Valet parking was available, but completely unnecessary.) Our check in was quick, and I avoided having a hold placed on my debit card by providing cash to be held overnight. Have $75 with you when you go there, and they'll take cash for the \"incidentals fee\" and they'll return it to you upon check out, minus the $18 parking fee. ( If you don't mind having a hold put on your debit or credit card, just beware that their sign states the hold may be up to five days.) We then went up to our room on the 9th floor. I got a room with one king sized bed, and it was fabulous. When we opened the curtains and saw the beautiful sight of Indianapolis at night, it was amazing. The room was very clean, and the bed was comfortable. It had a warm comforter, as well as a blanket, so it was very cozy. There were numerous pillows, as well as two body pillows which were a nice touch, I thought. The flat screen tv was nice. The room itself was attractive and even minor details made a lovely difference. For example, the desk chair was very comfortable, and it even had lumbar support--I could have fallen asleep in that chair! There was a little fridge hidden in a cabinet under the tv. There was also a comfy chair with an ottoman near the window, along with plenty of lighting. Our room was located near the elevators, and occasionally I could hear people pass by in the hall, but there was no disruptive noise. We could not hear through the walls, so I slept very well. I would return to this hotel again, and I was actually very sorry I had to leave. The view alone was worth the price I paid. Aside from the room, the hotel itself is attractive. It has a well-appointed, comfortable lobby area where people could gather with friends to visit. There were two computers available for guest use in the lobby, as well. (There is a business center, but unfortunately it was closed when I arrived.) My only criticism of the hotel would be that I don't think their location should be listed as \"downtown.\" Thank goodness I had my car, and I have GPS on my car because the drive to our downtown destinations took quite a few minutes, and there were a few twists and turns and one-way streets. If I'd booked this hotel and expected to be able to walk to anyplace downtown, I'd have been unhappy. In the summer this might not be too much of an issue for people who don't mind a bit of a walk, but in the dead of winter, it would be miserable.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cThe Poor Service Overshadowed the Quality\u201d", "Author": "IndyCessnaPilot", "ReviewID": "UR90281320", "Content": "I stayed here on business and had my son in tow.

I called the front desk to complain and learned that they decided to test the alarm at 5:30 p.m. The desk offered no apology and simply stated \"I don't know\" when asked how long the annoyance would persist. Then, I couldn't get back to sleep, so we ordered a pizza (mainly because I was too tired to go out). We received a cell phone call from the delivery driver who stated that the hotel wouldn't allow the delivery to the room. When I called the desk to see if they would just let him up, I was told there was no way he was coming to my room. Now, the hotel staff stated the reason for this policy because pizza delivery drivers are frequently robbed in hotels. You're right -- this is absurd. The true reason these hotels do this is to frustrate competition with their room service. If it were really a security concern, then why not escort the driver to the room, or have some other arrangement other than inconvenience the guest. This trip required me to get fully dressed, comb my hair, put on my shoes and socks, and walk down to the lobby from the 5th floor, find the driver in the crowded lobby, and then venture back to the room. In whatever profits the hotel believes it is earning from preventing the convenience of a pizza delivery, it will lose in lost room revenue. OTHERWISE, this is a very clean and comfortable hotel. They have subscribed to the cheapest cable TV package on the market, so keep this in mind if you are with children. However, it was comfortable and clean.

I would say its not a bad walk to the canal area and state park, if the weather was good. The hotel is remodeled, contemporary and overall nice. The staff is alright the rooms were adequate and clean. They have an air freshner in the air ducts that smells good but can be a litttle much. To get downtown they have a free shuttle that makes stops along a route and if not busy can take you to specific destinations, which we did. We were taken to Bazbeau's pizza on Mass. st. and I had no clue on how to get there so having a shuttle was actually nice. When you are done they give you a card with a number to call and tell them you are ready to be picked up.Each time we were picked up quickly. There are signs reminding you to tip the driver and I did as I felt he did a good job, so the shuttle actually is not totally free. Bottom line I would never make reservations at the University Place other than business at IUPUI, but if I bid on priceline again I am bidding LOW to make up for this locations downfalls, and to offset the inconvienences with a super cheap price.

But after a two nights stay this past weekend WOW I gotta say that I wasted my time in trying to change the reservation; this hotel lives up to the 4* ranking. Room Value: The rate through priceline was AMAZING! Staff: Super friendly and went out of their way to make my wife, my baby daughter's and my stay very pleasant and helped with various special requests.

The flat-screen tv was a nice addition to the room. Very updated decor! Bathroom: Great bathroom products like the oatmeal soap; bright & clean!

Standard Room with King size bed/non smoking was nice and large. Bathrooms & Hallways need to be modernized. I felt they were clean but it felt old looking to me, not attractive at all. The bedding was very comfortable. We used the shuttle to go to Dinner at Ruth Chris. The driver gave us a card to call and reminded us last pick up was at 11pm, this was on a saturday nite. Driver was friendly and everyone on this full shuttle enjoyed this nice ammenity that the hotel offers, if it fits in your schedule. We actually had to walk from Olives (Martini Bar at Omni), back to the hotel. We thought we could hail a taxi on our walk back. We saw 2 taxis but, they had passengers. My husband and myself ended up walking back to hotel on foot. Ugh!!! Parking, I felt should have been cheaper. This hotel, I know is in a medical area, but, for their overnite guests, parking should be cheaper, being as its so far from center of downtown indy. On the morning of our checkout, my husband called and asked for a later one hour checkout. Being that we lost one hour due to time change this sunday morning. The lady told him, she was sorry, but she couldn't accomodate his request, they had to get ready for incoming guests. This hotel was in no way full that saturday nite, and I felt being the time change our request could've been honored. This hotel was rated 4 stars on hotwire. This is no way a 4 star hotel. The omni downtown was our last 4 star indy hotel we stayed previously to this on hotwire. We just were extremely disappointed. I would've rather stayed at a 3star hotel in Indy's downtown proper than this 3star, rated 4star hotel. We didn't feel staff was friendly or that the hotel should even list their bar and restaurant, since they close early on saturday nite. Just extremely disappointed with this hotel. Price was comparible to the omni I had previously on hotwire, be careful, it was probably 7 months ago I had gotten omni for around the same price.

The bed had a lush pillow-top mattress, an easy chair in which to relax, there was a 27\" flat-screen TV, a great desk, office-style yet-stylish chair and hook-up for computer. Needless to say everything was clean, and the complimentary toiletries were worthy of a first-rate hotel. Had an a'la carte breakfast that was very satisfactory.

I loved this place. Everything was perfect and all the employees were very helpful. Our room was on the ninth floor and was tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable with a feather duvet on top. I've never been in a hotel with such great housekeeping. My room was cleaned in a timely fashion everyday. They didn't just come in and tidy up but gave an extensivley cleaning everyday. Towels, toiletries, sheets, were replaced everyday. Our bathroom was always spotless. We used the shuttle service once to got to Circle Centre Mall, our driver was very friendly and polite. When we wanted picked up he was there in 5 minutes. Great! There is a little food court in the hotel with Subway, Pizza, and a Gyro place that was convienent. If you don't mind walking about 1/2 mile you can also get to Tacobell/PizzaHut, Quiznos, Qdoba, PapaJohns, and a quaint little sandwhich shop. (We didn't rent a car) Only gripe I have about this place is that it's located on The Univeristy Of Indiana Purdue campus, so there's students everywhere, including lounging in the reception area of the hotel. There was nowhere to sit because students were relaxing with their laptops. We never had any problems with our keys they worked everytime. The gym was nice, used it everyday I was there, nice big plasmas to watch while you work out. There is also fruit everywhere in this hotel that's there for the taking, nice little perk.

Rooms: I was at the end of the hallway (bonus = one more window with a different view). Room is very modern, great decor, high-end furnishings (marble countertop in bathroom, wood desk, chaise lounge, wonderfully comfortable king size bed with very clean linens and 5 pillows), flat screen LCD TV, comfortably sized bathroom with good water pressure and lots of thick towels, generous closet with mirrored doors, Molton Brown sundries, ceramic ionic blowdryer, radio that you can hook your MP3 player to. Food: we enjoyed the Bistro twice for breakfasts, their buffet was excellent. The hotel provided everything from box lunches to full lunch buffets to appetizers and cash bar, everything was excellent. Room access: never had a problem getting into my room. Room attendants: unintrusive, thorough, helpful. Front desk: everyone was helpful, no lines at checkout. Bellman very helpful in storing luggage until my room was ready. My early checkout arrived one day to early, but the front desk was very polite and extended my stay one day (to match my original request) and rescanned my room keys right away (and the room keys worked). Location: very close to Purdue and Indiana U. Hotel offers free shuttle service to nearby locations (we used this extensively to shop at Circle Center, dine at Slippery Noodle --where we saw Karen Allen and a few actors from Animal House, and enjoy several restaurants and martini bars in the area. Great drivers, always timely (they serve a 3-mile radius, never too long of a wait until the shuttle returns). Conference facilities: very good. Free internet access provided on the first floor with three stations. Note that it is a $30 one-way fare from airport to hotel by taxi, I would recommend the shared limo service instead (around $7).", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rainbow City", "Title": "\u201cWill never book a room at this hotel again!\u201d", "Author": "Beachtraveler226", "ReviewID": "UR5833516", "Content": "Booked a room for a team event in Indianapolis 6 months in advance and were charged a one night deposit.

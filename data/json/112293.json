You would think one of them could take time to make a TV channel listing that is accurate, so each guest does not have to do this themselves.

Well, the Suites are actually like renting a small condo that is serviced like a hotel room, and they are at least as comfortable as those offered by the large \"suites\" chains. There's nothing like lounging in an actual living room after a day of out and about, or even dining in if one so chooses.

This is in the Marina, just down the street from our old house, so I know the area really well. But neither I nor any of my friends knew Cow Hollow Motor Inn had great apartments for rent, or a huge underground parking garage. We arrived Monday early afternoon, and they already had our suite ready, which was great since our babies were ready for a long nap. We had recently stayed at 3 different hotels on the east coast, including the Ritz in Philly, and no hotel could get the cribs in our room prior to our arrival, so we were so pleased to find the pack n plays already placed in our spacious apartment. Parking is covered, copious and free. There is a key-guarded elevator that goes right up to our floor; unfortunately, it stopped working Tuesday night and the front desk had no idea until I told them Weds morning, and it still wasn't working Thurs morning, so that's why only four stars for overall. But the pros of this place far outweigh the cons. The one bedroom was bright and spacious, with a big living room with fireplace. It was furnished with a large sofa, comfy chair, ottoman, flat panel TV, window seat and a desk in the corner. There is a fully equipped galley kitchen and a dining area for two adjacent. The bedroom has a king bed, flat panel TV, and large closet. The bathroom is spacious but not luxurious. There are hardwood floors and nice area rugs. My only complaint about Suite 141 is that the bedroom fronts Chestnut Street, and is therefore very loud. The buses continue to run past 1AM and deliveries on the street start before 5AM. But it was fine for our family of four in terms of space, but I couldn't sleep even with ear plugs. The room cost $235 per night, and I found out Tuesday morning that the two bedroom, two bath next door (Suite 142) was available and only $50 more! We moved right away. This apartment has an even larger living room that fronts Chestnut, but that's actually a bonus, a dining room with table for four, and full size kitchen. The guest bedroom has a queen bed but no TV. The master is very large with a king bed, flag panel, large walk in closet. The two baths are a bit smaller than in the one bedroom, but not a problem. It also has hardwood floors, a large coat closet, great furnishings (antiques and big cozy chairs), and the bedrooms are in the back. Suite 143 is also a two bedroom in the back, and 144 is a one bedroom in the back. I would suggest just avoiding the Suites 141 and (presumably) 241 upstairs. This place is great with excellent, attentive service (except for the broken elevator), and we are very happy with our stay.

Our room faced out over busy Lombard Street but with the window shut we weren't bothered at all by traffic noise. Best thing is the location in Marina/Cow Hollow area. Really nice restaurants on your doorstep (try Bistro Aix round the corner on Steiner - mmmmm). You are also between two great shopping areas, Union Street and Chestnut Street (both full of cafes, restaurants, nice shops and boutiques). Generally the area is quite affluent, busy, lots of younger people, very safe and welcoming feeling. Number 30 bus connects you very quickly with most main tourist areas.

Convenient laundry room right across the hall, with free soap. **Now the minuses. Old tube tv (with broken knobs & buttons)in the bedroom that could only manage a greenish tinged picture.

Until the last few years, the service was good and if, at check in, the hotel could not meet requests for floor and room type, they apologized and did the best they could to accommodate you. This is no longer the case. Our last 3 stays have involved very perfunctory even unpleasant experiences at check in. The front desk now has all the charm of an airport ticket counter, with the same adversarial, hurried feeling. When I asked if anyone had even read our request for the 3rd floor, I was told with a shrug \"we are very popular now.\" When we checked out, I noticed many welcome bags on the back counter and got the impression that the hotel caters to groups and does not really care about individual travellers anymore. The rooms are reasonably sized but have gotten a little worn looking, with scuffed furniture, somewhat worn mattresses, and the occasional stains on the carpets. If you can get a room in the back on the 2nd or 3rd floor, the hotel is still a good deal, but if you end up on Steiner St. or worse yet on Lombard St. you'd better not mind lots of traffic noise.

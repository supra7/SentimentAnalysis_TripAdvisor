We were concerned about having to drive in Baltimore and the logistics of getting to and from the hospital since she is in a walker/wheelchair. Once we got parked, we never had to move the car. The front desk calls a free shuttle service provided by UMMC and they deliver you to and from the hospital. And, if you call the hotel to make the reservation, they give a special rate to family members visiting patients. The gentlemen at the front door and the lobby were terrific. They always helped with the chair and steps and gave great tips for all the questions we asked. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times, and it was satisfactory. The room was fine - nothing special but very clean with a refrigerator and microwave. Everything we needed. The bedding was wonderful and we slept well. We did venture a few blocks to eat at a recommended restaurant and had no problems. It seems centrally located to all the tourist attractions. One tip I can offer is about parking if you are using the Days Inn as your \"home\" while visiting the hospital. It costs $23 to park at the hotel while the parking garage at the hospital is only $6 and you can use it 24 hours. Park at the hospital then use the shuttle to take you back to the hotel. Our shuttle driver even took one guest back to the garage, drove in and found her car and dropped her off.

We stayed at the Days Inn Inner Harbor Baltimore, MD and got in around 10:30pm on a Thursday evening. As soon as we pulled up to the front lobby, there was a gentleman who was already at our car with a dolly to grab our bags and take them in. He was the friendliest person and took very good care of our bags. He asked us where we were from and wished us luck with the tournament. Then we asked the front desk about local bars to get a drink and they were so helpful. They even walked us outside to show us where to go...at almost 11 o'clock at night! Every day we went by the lobby there was someone to greet us and tell us to have a great day. We went to the hotel restaurant for dinner one night and the food was delicious. The cafe was wonderful and again, the woman who worked there remembered what we drank- the chai tea with vanilla was very good.

There are also lots of great restaurants nearby. The room had a microwave & refrigerator. It also had free--one water bottle, one package of microwave popcorn, one granola bar. The bed was comfortable, room clean & bug-free, although some parts were old/worn. They do not offer a free breakfast, but do have a little restaurant where you can pay $13 (!) for a small buffet breakfast (which was almost the same as offered free at Choice Hotels). They do have a coffee pot in the room with 2 coffee packets--the lobby also has a 'java' niche where you can buy more coffee & sweet rolls, muffins, etc. All staff were VERY friendly and willing to answer questions. They have adjourning parking garage privileges for $22 per 24 hours. Take the ticket and have it scanned by the hotel front desk...that way you can go in and out of the lot (using the ticket) without paying over and over. The $22 is put on your hotel account.

My family booked the hotel for us because it was a good price. But the price was simply not worth it. First getting into the hotel was a nightmare! We drove around in loops for about 25 minutes trying to get into the place. The signs that said \"entrance here\" with an arrow were after the actual entrance getting us disoriented only to have to loop around again. Once we got in we only learned that we had to go back out to the street to access the parking garage - which was $22 per night! And that was where the next problem set in. They told us it was good for 24 hours - don't believe them. It was only good until 12pm noon - because if you wanted to walk around after checking out like what we did - we got charged another day which was a complete rip off. There were four of us down to check in and we all got the same story - 24 hour parking fee - which is supposed to be a great deal and perk for staying at the hotel, according to them. So for my dad who was there for less than 24 hours he had to pay $44 to park. The location was okay. They say inner harbor but it is about a 7-8 block to the actual inner harbor. And it wasn't the safest location. As a female I refused to go anywhere without someone else in my party with me. And that was even if we were walking down to the corner bar a block away. The cleanliness was definitely subpar. The room size was decent. The tub was not draining properly and with four of us in a room we had to wait a half hour in between showers just to allow the tub to drain. A big inconvenience. The windows were definitely not sound proof. The first night I was kept up listening to sirens for about 2-3 hours and then the second night my brother-in-law was up half the night listening to the rain (that's bad when you can hear the rain and your up on the 6th floor) The elevators were a disaster! We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights for a total of 36 hours and one of the two elevators was broken for at least 15 hours. The morning we were checking out there was a line for the elevator to go down of about 15 people on our floor alone! (the elevators were small and could only fit maybe 8-10 people and that was if they were sandwiched in which no one really wants. Plus there were 8-9 floors - so what if there were that many waiting on each floor?!?!) We decided not to wait because it took an average of 5-10 minutes to wait for the elevator normally when both were working and we didn't have a half hour to stand around and waste. So we had to take the stairs six flights down with our luggage. That was a joy... All in all I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The money it looks like you are saving you are not with the added taxes and then the expensive parking.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great Staff, Great Location in Inner Harbor\u201d", "Author": "OhioOriolesFan", "ReviewID": "UR116910466", "Content": "Our family, two adults, two children, travelled from Ohio to the hotel.

At first I was booked at the Sheritan then changed to Days Inn since I was only staying one night and it was much cheaper ($89 vs $169). I was a little hesitant as let's face it most Days Inns are foreign owned and operated and well associated with the words low class, dirty and bug infested. I was so pleasantly suprised and thrilled at how wonderful this place was. The staff are very helpful and work hard to ensure you have a pleasant stay. The room was very nice and clean, there is a separate sitting area with a couch, beds are comfy and there is a microwave and fridge in the rooms. Free WiFi is also included in your price. I would compare this hotel to a Hampton Inn with free internet. The resturant in the hotel is not bad. Very resonably price and decent. I give the resturant 3 stars and the bartender with his wonderful cocktails a 4.5 (he makes a very yummy Amareto Sour). If you want a nice place to stay while staying within a budget, STAY HERE you won't be disappointed. However, if you have money to burn and want to spend over twice as much for a room in a little newer hotel, the Sheritan and Marriot are about 2 blocks away. Keep in mind on top of the pricey room you will also spend an extra $12/day for internet and most rooms do not have microwaves and refridgerators in them. However, I say, stay here and take the extra money you would have spent for a room at the Marriot and have a lovely dinner at one of Baltimore's fine resturants. I recommend Prime Steak House about a mile from the hotel. It is owned and operated by Executive Chef Tim Dean (seen on season 7 of Top Chef). Lovely food and won't kill your pocket book. OR you can take a $20 cab ride to Toby's Dinner theater located in the Best Western and see some real Broadway talent on stage. The food is \"OK\" and dinner and the show is about $54 but well worth every dime. Their singers, dancers and actors are absolutely wonderful! I can't encourage you enough to give this hotel a try.

One awkward thing I would recommend to the staff to change: Put up a sign to limit computer use when people are waiting. A woman came in to use the computer and had to sit on the floor and wait for one. I was the last one on, but I got off quick. I just wanted to order my aquarium tickets, anyway. Parking is $22 and ends at noon on checkout day. Then the rate is $22 after 2 hours, so if you plan to stay longer than noon, you should move your car across the street to the Arena parking, which is $10 flat fee all day.

Then the coffee mugs were set on the table upside down so the lip you drink from is sitting in the wet dirty solution. Needless to say I moved to the dry side of the table. Wait, what? Half the table was wet and half dry? I can only guess that only the side someone else sat was cleaned. I asked for just two eggs, once over, and toast. Well I got that plus fried potatoes, which I didn't want, nor did I eat. And I was of course charged an arm and a leg for it! She did not hear me, maybe it was my Midwestern accent! lol.

Expedia had good rates for this hotel compared with its neighbors. We arrived late in the evening, as we were visiting with family outside of DC. The security guard was very nice and assisted us with our luggage and check-in. The clerk at the desk was also friendly, however gave me unclear directions as to how to get on the parking garage at that time of night, which was very stressful for me since I had enough trouble finding the entrance to the hotel in the first place. I was pleased to see my bags and my souse in our room upon my return. I did not sleep very well the first night as the wall-unit air conditioner was very loud (even though there was a \"sleep\" mode) and the room would get too hot if it was not on. Being given a first floor room in a city, we did not get the chance to sleep late with trucks and morning traffic whizzing by. There was a cafe and a full service restaurant in the hotel, but I went to the nearby Starbucks for coffee and we used the in room fridge and microwave to heat up breakfast we bought in DC. The restaurant was kind enough to provide us with plates and utensils both mronings since there were none in the room. There was also a lack of information regarding the hotel and its policies in the room, which I found quite odd. The second night we slept a little better, but overall we did not have a relaxing stay. Although the room was nicely furnished and clean, it was very stuffy and the shower provided poor water pressure. Another annoying thing was that although we paid for 48 hours of parking, we really only got 36 hours as we arrived late in the evening and had to leave the garage by noon.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property\u201d", "Author": "John4life", "ReviewID": "UR104775366", "Content": "I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.

The service was usually very good. I had very long hours at the show, and would want to have breakfast before and dinner and a drink after in the restaurant. One morning it took more than 40 minutes to get a simple bacon and eggs breakfast. I could not wait that long so I had to head to the show hungry. One night, the restaurant stopped serving food early because they had gotten too busy for the staff to handle. There were many empty tables by the time we arrived, so my friend and I decided to just order a bottle of wine for our room and some take out (from a local place). Our take out had been delivered long before the head waiter in the restaurant would not even look at us let alone stop at our table to take our order. We tried to place it with another waitress who was extremely nice, but she was unable to bring the wine for some reason the waiter had to do it. He seemed to be having a very bad night. I'd stay there again, but I'd have a back up plan for drinks and meals in case the bar/restaurant got backed up or had slow service.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henderson, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGood Location - Good Value\u201d", "Author": "travelinlife4me", "ReviewID": "UR72146845", "Content": "This hotel is for the person looking for a decent room at a decent price in a good location.

I was nervous that it might not be working so called and asked for maintenance to check it out. Within minutes a maintenance man arrived, checked it over and reassured me it was a new unit and the room would cool off. He waited to make sure it went through a cycle. He was polite and friendly. We left to go to the harbor and when we returned the room was very cool. I called for a roll away and it was delivered. Called down to ask for pillows and an extra blanket and they were delivered within an hour. (blanket was new and in plastic wrapping) The room had 2 beds and getting the roll away did make it cramped. We put the rollaway next to the bed and the window. (and had to put a pillow against part of the air conditioning unit so my niece would not get too cold) She said the roll away was comfortable. The staff are extremely polite, and friendly. I found the front desk staff were efficient, and the general staff were very nice. The beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned well each of the days we stayed (3 nights). The bathroom was small and the sink is outside. The lighting is not great for putting on your makeup so I used the desk as a vanity and the light there was great. The room has a coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. All worked well. The room was done in forest greens, beige and brown. Not bright colors but attractive.

Buffet also includes coffee, juice. The pool (outside) is staffed by a lifeguard but is only open to 8. It is small but was ok for our purposes. Parking is adjacent to the hotel and is $20 a day. You need to take your ticket to the front desk and they process it so you can have in and out priviledges. Final charges go on your credit card unless you make other arrangements.

The hotel manager, William Heitzer, was a true professional and I am sending a letter to the general manager tomorrow to let know know of my experience. Again, let me emplasize that the hotel is NOT affiliated with the attached parking garage. William went above and beyond to help with everything. He called the police and the garage clerk, offered us a complimentary breakfast while we waited for the police. After the police left he went with me to submit my incident report to the garage clerk, refunded my parking fee and had a nice gentleman from maintnence vacume the glass and tape plastic onto my window. Wow. True customer service.

The evening desk clerk sent security up to ask them to be quiet after we went downstairs to complain.

The security could have been a bit firmer rather than saying \"We need to ask you to be quiet-sorry to have interrupted your evening\". Sorry to have interrupted your evening??!!

This looks like one of the brown brick Days Inns you might see out on the highway...except perhaps a bit taller. It looks kind of out of place in the Baltimore skyline. The plus of that is the convenient short term parking out front while checking in. You have to pay to park in the covered garage attached to the rear of the hotel after you've checked in; the rate was about $18; that may seem like a lot but it's good for downtown. There is very easy access to 395, so you can get in and out of the city quickly. The hotel is gloomy on the inside as well as the outside. The decor features lots of tan and brown. I found the halls to be dimly lit. The rooms are similarly dark and depressing. However they are clean, if a little worn. My room had scuffed furniture, mildew stains (just stains, not mildew) and some burn marks on the sink. The linens were frayed as well. But I have no complaints about the housekeeping; it was regular and thorough. My room was also very quiet (I was on a higher floor but the windows did seem to be soundproof, so lower floors might be OK too). DON'T believe the \"3 blocks to Harbor Place\" hype. It's 3 blocks if you count the Convention Center as one block, even though it spans several blocks. It's more like 4 or 5 blocks to the Harbor, and at night they are long, lonely blocks; I didn't feel unsafe, but some might. It is, however, very convenient to the Convention Center, also near Camden Yards. I found the service to be friendly, helpful and courteous. The staff seemed very solicitous of my needs during my stay. The on-site restaurant had high prices and mediocre quality. I would avoid it in favor of the many good restaurants in Baltimore. There is a pool on the ground floor, right at street level. It is separated from the street by a brick screen. You can hear (and partially see) rush hour traffic while you swim.

The reply e-mail said I needed call the day of arrival. Although I thought that my e-mail *should* have been enough notice, I called before boarding my flight to let them know I would arrive between midnight and 1am.

When he returned to the desk, the agent told me \"I have some good news and some bad news: The good news is that you won't have to pay for your room tonight. The bad news is that it isn't here.\" I told him that there was no good news: I wasn't paying for my room anyway - I was on the job for the state of Georgia. I was being sent to the Mt Vernon Inn, \"about six blocks north\" (more like 8) and that I could come back to the Days Inn the next day. I complained that the Mt Vernon Inn was considerably further from my conference location - he gave me a total of $15 for taxi fare. I was also given a letter to give to Mt Vernon and was escorted out to a waiting rattle-trap taxi. At the Mt Vernon, I caught up with the aforementioned angry man - he had been booted from his reservation too. While the Mt Vernon was older and not as nice as the Days Inn, I decided to stay and negotiated to get the room for all three nights for the same rate that Days Inn paid for the first night ($99 vs $155 market or $122 govt employee rate). The extra walking was only a bit of a hassle (esp the last day w/luggage) and the neighborhood a bit \"more interesting\" - the REAL problem is being booted out of my room so late the night before having to give a presentation at the conference. Shortly after canceling my room via phone, I did stop by the Days Inn. The front desk manager was very apologetic and said they felt bad about it. I was NEVER given an explanation of what happened.

As for the hotel: Accessability: It was easy to find with directions we printed from Mapquest. It is a great location, within walking distance to just about everything including the Metro/Subway which is what we took to the festival and that too was easy to navigate. Parking: It is right next door in a parking garage, which I do not believe is owned by the hotel. I think it is a little crazy that they make their guests pay for parking. You pay over-exaggerated rates to stay downtown and closer to inner-harbor, the least they can do is include the parking in the room rate....because they also do not include a continental breakfast like most hotels do. Rooms: we requested a NON-SMOKING room and there was not an ashtray in sight, but the smell when you walked in the door could of knocked you over. I think that if a hotel has designated non-smoking rooms they should enforce that policy for those said rooms because there are people out there who do prefer to sleep in a hotel room that does not smell of stale cigarettes. However, we were late getting to the festival and decided not to switch rooms and to just get on with our day and why we were in B-town to begin with....the concert. :o) The rooms were pretty standard. We had a queen bed, sofa and coffee table and side table and tv and armoire. They also provide you with a small refrigerator and microwave (probably why breakfast in not included either). They did have a coffee pot that distributed coffee directly into a mug, but unfortunately we weren't give any coffee mugs so we didn't get to use that for our morning caffeine fix. The beds are hard....so be prepared for that. The sink is outside of the bathroom so it is easy for two people to get ready at the same time. Room Service: we ordered room service and it was pretty good.

I am not handicapped, it was the only room available. I noticed the handrails (good) low toilet(good), and very high sink. Someone correct me, but should a sink be chest high for a wheelchair accessible room? And the tiles need to be redone. Their age is showing.

For that amount of time it was perfect. For a week stay in Baltimore, it isn't very practical. But... *Room* - the room was average. The size was fine for four people. Two queen size beds were in our room. It was clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was extremely small. But, a fridge and microwave oven came in the room with no extra fee. This was a very great added bonus. A few things broke, but they were quickly and efficiently. replaced and/or fixed. Overall, the room gets 6/10 stars. *Lobby* - the lobby was, again, average. There was a large sitting area, but overall, the lobby was pretty small. No place you want to spend all your time in! There were many resources, such as brochures and maps to get in the lobby. Overall, the lobby gets 6/10 stars. *Service* - the service was excellent. Staff was a huge help in finding things to do and getting directions for us. They were very willing to help and excellent helpers. The quickly and efficiently replaced and/or fixed our broken things in our room. Overall, the staff gets 8/10 stars. *Pool* - the pool was, once again, average. It was small, but we were one of the few ones there. It was clean, though, and a lifeguard looked over us. However, it was extremely cold because it was the beginning/middle of June and it was between two large, tall buildings, so it was shaded and did not get a lot of sun. You probably do not want to go swimming unless you like the cold, it is really hot out, or it is in July or August. Overall, the pool gets 6/10 stars. *Restaurant* - the restaurant seemed nice, but we did not go in it. It was fairly expensive and there is NO free breakfast. The menu seemed pretty good, but we have no idea how good the food was. Overall, we are not going to rate the restaurant because we do not feel informed enough to do so. *Location* - the inner harbor was about 3 or 4 blocks away if you go in the right, correct direction. It was a nice, short walk that was very pleasurable. We did not encounter any problems at all, whatsoever. Overall, the location gets 7/10 stars. Overall, the hotel was fairly nice and we might stay here again, but only for 2 or 3 nights, at tops.

She could have directed me to the Harbor area that is beautiful and geared for tourists (tons of shops, eateries). For 24 hours, the hotel was without hot water. When I requested compensation, I was given a coupon for a free buffet breakfast (which had cold pancakes, undercooked bacon, and eggs I did not care for. They also had cold cereal and yogurt, buffet is normally $12). When I checked out, I found a $1.00 per day safe charge (which they begrudgingly removed) and a $0.50 per use fee to use an \"800\" calling card (this charge was not removed, but I do not recall this charge being advertised anywhere).

We called down to get it changed and we told that the hotel was booked. It was nice that there was a safe in the room free to use. I thought that was one benefit since we had items that needed safe keeping. The bathroom shower was also quite nice with really good water pressure. Since it was a handicap room, the bathroom was bigger than most. In the morning they kept advertising their New Years breakfast. It was a buffet with complimentry champagne and pit beef. Not quite what you would want in the morning........even if you had been up all night celebrating the New Year. The buffet did have great food. It had a person making omelets but we decided not to get any because it was taking so long. When we finally got our bill, we were astounded. It was $20 a person! We were never informed of the price. While the food was good, it wasn't THAT good! I guess that champagne and pit beef wasn't really complimentry after all. All in all, I don't think that I would stay there again.

And, we aren't crazy about B&Bs because of too many experiences with overly controlling owners or obnoxious fellow guests. So I was happy to find the BW Stevenson Manor and all of its positive reviews. Normally, we don't stay at Best Westerns because the quality tends to be inconsistent -- and we've encountered too many properties in desperate need of renovation. I'm happy to report that the BW Stevenson Manor met most of my expections, and we enjoyed our stay very much. Our King w/balcony room was very spacious. We loved having the microwave, fridge, free wifi, and iPod dock. Our room was also billed as having a \"mountain view.\" Technically, that is correct. You could see the mountains BUT even more prominent was the John Deere dealership. That's not exactly my idea of a scenic view (see attached photos). We did ask to be moved several doors up towards the front of the property so that at least it wasn't a direct view of the tractor yard when we walked in. They accomodated us very nicely with this request, but I do think they should take out \"view\" altogther from the room descriptions because it implies something good. The continental breakfast had a good variety of options -- bagels, packaged muffins, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal made in a crock pot (very good) with all kinds of toppings, cereals, and a waffle maker. I wasn't a fan of the waffle batter, but I'm pretty picky about that. All in all, this is a well-locate, well-maintained motel that I woujldn't hesitate to stay in again. And if you're a fan of John Deere equipment, you'll love it even more. :)", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minden, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Donald B", "ReviewID": "UR127757196", "Content": "We were extremely pleased with our accommodations at Best Western Plus Stevenson Manor in Calistoga.

But your lodging choices here are mostly very expensive boutique spas. But what if you are on a budget, or have kids, or don't need 24/7 spa access? Well, then there is the Best Western Stevenson Manor. I'm giving it Five Stars because it is hands-down THE BEST VALUE FOR MONEY at this end of the Wine Country. However a good price is only an advantage if it doesn't mean substandard. At the Stevenson, you get scrupulously clean and spacious rooms -- a few with fireplaces -- and lots of amenities that add up to way more than you'd expect for the cost (which is well below $100 a night, especially with the many discounts offered: 2 or 3 night stay discount, AARP, AAA, Military. They even offer a discount for guest who are staying to be near relatives having operations at nearby St. Helena Hospital.) First of all, some of the pictures of the exterior make the place look bigger than it is. Rather than a big impersonal chain hotel, this is a cozy little motel -- only part of which is two story -- built around a charming little enclosed patio. The location is an easy walk to all the restaurants and spas along Calistoga's main drag. Let's go over what I got for my room rate of $89 (return visit discount for a Thursday and Friday night stay): *A large, scrupulously clean room with two double beds with comfortable linens and a lovely bathroom with whirlpool tub. (Some rooms have fire places and several are handicapped accessible.) *Lots of amenities such as free newspapers, Wi-Fi, sink, microwave, refrigerator, wine glasses, coffee service in room and more. *An amazingly good FREE breakfast that included my choice of waffles, yogurt and fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, toast, pastries, fresh juice. *Afternoon complimentary wine tasting with the day's featured wine and cheese. *Extremely friendly, attentive staff -- from the owner/manager who acted as a gracious host to the guy who quickly fixed a minor problem with our TV. This hotel would be especially good for families with children -- especially since kids are not usually welcomed at some of the more boutiquey inns around here. If you were trying to do the area on a budget or with a family, the free breakfasts alone would make it doable. (Load the kids up at breakfast, then stock your in-room fridge with snacks and sandwich fixins from the nearby Cala Market.) It's also a great budget option for exploring Wine Country. Most people flock to overpriced, overcrowded St. Helena. But Calistoga is right at the tip of the two main wine trails through the Valley -- Route 29 and the Silverado Trail. Calistoga also features some nice little museums such as The Sharpsteen Museum and access to mountain hiking, the Petrified Forest and the Old Faithful Geyser. Here are the things to be aware of about the Stephenson: *The hotel has a very nice little heated pool area with pool, hot tub, sauna. Yes, it is small, but almost all of the resorts around here have day passes or free pool access if you book a spa treatment. So use the Stephenson pool most days and book a spa treatment/pool day somewhere else for a splurge. *This is not necessarily a spot for a romantic getaway. While not as noisy as one reviewer claimed, people with children do stay here. As noted in other reviews, there are some rooms that are further removed from common areas. If quiet is important to you, ask for those rooms. So my recommendations? Families with kids or people on a budget, this is your place. AS for me? I don't have kids and I'm not on a budget, but I'm still glad I discovered the Stephenson. I was here twice while my mother had a knee replacement at St. Helena Hospital -- so I wasn't here for a vacation. But I found my experience enjoyable and comfortable. The bonus was, I felt comfortable splurging on a massage and good dinners at some of the town's best restaurants since my stay at the Stephenson was so reasonable.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Stay\u201d", "Author": "TexasTravelGirl36", "ReviewID": "UR124178326", "Content": "Great place to stay in Napa for the $!

I had one queen in the room and the bed felt like anytime they had one person staying they put them in this room for the past 5 years and every single one of them slept right in the middle of the bed.

The pool area was quite small, but perfect for the number of guest rooms there, and again was clean, with towels available etc. The continental breakfast was exactly what we wanted, to set us up for our day ahead, and we were easily impressed by the waffle machine! The only downside to hotel (and this is minor) was that it is right at the end of the main street in Calistoga, and so you have probably the most amount of walking to do as possible in the town. It is not a large street so is no issue, but when walking back late at night there are no street lights at this end of town, so would recommend taking a torch for your walk back if you want a drink...........

Reading other gushing reviews, I was a little skeptical that this place was this good for relatively little money. After having spent a night there, I will chime in and give a second to all previous commentary about the Stevenson. I would really have to nit pick to find something wrong with this motel, and the overall experience. Where to begin? Pleasant reception; helpful and friendly staff; clean, well-maintained room; mini-kitchen with whole bean coffee!!; whirlpool bathtub; pool view; complimentary internet; iPod dock. On the outside, heated pool and hot tub, ample parking lot, pleasant courtyard-sitting area to enjoy a glass of Napa Valley wine. We would have preferred a queen bed instead of a double, but not a big deal. A continental breakfast is advertised. Usually that means a stale cinnamon roll and coffee. Not here. Fresh waffles, hard-boiled eggs, coffee, cereal, fruit, toasted bagels, muffins or bread, muffins, orange juice, etc. Breakfast room can get busy around 8:30, so go earlier or later, maybe. If it is SRO, there is another dining room adjacent to the office, or enjoy the courtyard. The property is located at the east end of the main street and is away from the CBD, but a very pleasant, short walk into town. If it is essential for you to be right at center stage, front row, then the Stevenson may not be for you. The location, however, was a positive for us. Calistoga is the perfect base to visit both the Napa Valley and Sonoma wineries, and seems like a thousand miles away from the gridlock that has become St. Helena. Really, for the mid $100.00 range, for a quality wine country lodging, in season, this place is a bargain. Guaranteed, we will stay at the Stevenson again when visit the Napa Valley. Oh, a note on visiting local wineries. As I said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while since our last visit. Nothing is gratis here, any longer. Most if not all charge for tasting. And, most do not have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno appointment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 winery-only tour. If they offer a guided tour at all, you will have the pleasure of forking out $20.00, minimum.

The breakfast options were plentiful and had something for the whole family, but when we got our food, there were no open tables to sit. Luckily, one of the staff members recommended taking our food out to the inn's sun-splashed courtyard. We were able to take advantage of the beautiful weather even more, and it offered the kids space to run around while we finished our breakfast. Monday morning came too quick, but the in-room high speed Wi-Fi allowed me to sign-in for my morning sales call and in room coffee grinder/maker made me functional during it. All the while, my kids got to steal one more dip into the pool before we had to head out. What a treat and spending it at Stevenson Manor was a huge part of it.

We didn't the first time, which is why we stayed here. It was exactly as expected - average chain hotel with outside pool and spa. Way too corporate for a stay in this cute little town. Even if you have kids, I think you could find a more interesting hotel/BnB with an outside pool. Having kids would be the only reason I would ever stay here again, and then as a last resort.

What a treat. We stayed mid-week and called to get a room price. They like to keep the Inn as full as possible so gave us a very good rate and put us in a huge room with a beautiful fireplace. Coffee makers with coffee grinders built in and fresh coffee beans ready to go. Clean, new and quiet and in a great location for visiting the various wineries in the Nappa Valley. Staff was wonderful, polite and seemed to enjoy making their customers happy. Nice continental breakfast to start your day. While in the area don't miss the tour of the Rutherford Winery caves. Interesting and fun. The deli food at V. Satillo Vineyards is amazing and we had a wonderful picnic on the grounds with a delicious bottle of their wine. If you're a \"foody\" don't miss attending a class at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone. Chef was fun and informative and the focaccia was delicious. Their gourmet shop has everything you could hope for in the way of gadgets for the at home chef. Will return at the first opportunity to this lovely valley and will hope to stay at the Stephenson Manor Inn.

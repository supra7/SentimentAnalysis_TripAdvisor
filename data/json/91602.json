Amenities include all in one shampoo/conditioner and a hair dryer. There is a small coffee pot too. The bed and pillows were comfy. The walls are paper thin so don't expect to get much sleep. You can hear people talking as they pass outside your door as well as the water running in the shower in the adjacent room. The noise above us was worse so make sure you ask for the top floor! You must make a reservation for the airport shuttle. It leaves every 20 minutes and makes a stop at another La Quinta about a block away. They just acquired this La Quinta so that's why there are 2 of them so close together. As promised, we made it to the airport in about 12 minutes. The staff is super friendly. The continental breakfast includes make your own waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, bagels, muffins, bread for toast and packets of instant oatmeal. All in all, it was pretty good--beats nothing! Drinks included coffee, water, milk, apple and orange juice. I probably wouldn't stay here again due to the noise factor.

Slight smell of smoke, but not terrible. Beds were not the most comfortable. Towels worn down to nothing. And we found a bug in one of the beds. Free Breakfast had little to offer. no fruit. Cereal, hard boiled eggs (a huge jar of them...how long were they there?), Orange juice was gone by 8:30am. They did have 2 waffle makers, both of which were dirty when we went to eat. Bagels were wrapped in plastic wrap, meaning they were kept day to day, not fresh. Ick again. Noise was a problem. Thin walls!

The fact that I hadn't been to church since Christmas didn't cross my mind but perhaps that had a play in my experience. Karma is a son of a gun. I needed directions to the airport and the front desk person was awesome. She took the guess work out of my lack of planning. Check in was quick and painless. I saw a bunch of semi trucks parked out front but it didn't occur to me at the time this was at all relevant. Ahhh...but opening the door a well worn carpet that resembled a path diverging into the woods told me this room was definitely not less traveled. Tossing my bag onto one of the beds, I couldn't but help notice the mattresses reminded me of a cellophane wrapped airport sandwich. Had I come in a few hours later, I could've made up a stack of belgian waffles in the lobby and doubled the thickness of my evening magic carpet to fly me to Dream Land. To my chagrin, the alarm clock woke me up at the precise moment I set it. The complimentary plastic bottles of shampoo worked their charm. I'm not sure who did the patch work porcelain work in the tub but it looked like the worker finished minutes before Immigration came knocking. Bounding out of the room to the lobby, my check out was quick and tidy. The breakfast lobby looked like a family truck stop. No fresh fruit here, Billy Bob! The begian waffle maker was a popular draw. Yogurt, truck stop style coffee, and plastic embalmed sweet rolls beckoned as well. It was a cheap room for a quick snooze. Knock off a half star and it's a good descriptor. Add fresh fruit to the breakfast spread and I'll spot you that half star. Don't change the staff, change the matteresses and clean the carpet.

During one check-in, they allowed me to check in early without any fuss, and I really appreciated that. The parking is free (which is not the case for the other hotel nearby), as is the wired internet. The view from parts of the hotel is not that bad, either. You can get a pretty good view of the harbor. Finally, based on the price ($60 to $70 less expensive than most other hotels, at a minimum), it wasn't disappointing. I'm sure if I had paid $200-300 per room instead, that it might be better. The bad things: There aren't a whole lot of amazing view or beaches right nearby, though the scenery around was still impressive. The rooms seemed older, and one of the two rooms I had didn't seem as clean. It was a handicapped room, and because of the way the shower was built, water does flow toward the carpet in the room, and I believe that does cause some moldy smell to build up. But it was in no means the worse, again. It does tend to detract from the overall stay, though.

I looked forward to swimming in the pool but discovered that it is closed during and after dinner. I had time for a short swim- there were not available towels at the pool area. The pool adjoins the restaurant and I guess they do not want the noise to interfere with diners. It is on the roof of a balcony- so shielded from the street. Breakfast included hot and cold items and was fine. Hotel was close to several stores and chain restaurants but I do not think you could walk to them.

We moved here to Maui but are headed back to the Mainland. My husband went a week ahead of us. I checked in, ( cleaning the house it was easier by getting a hotel in town we lived in Kihei) then sudden pain :( the hotel took me to the ER. Staff & security watched my two boys 6-10. Till almost midnight. A customer service girl named Melissa was getting off work( lived in Kihei) but drove to pick me up first. They brought the kids toys & drinks. My husband kept in contact with all of is. But the hotel quizzed him like no other before letting him speak to the boys. I TRAVEL A LOT BUT HAVE NEVER SEEN A HOTEL GO THIS FAR AND BEYOND TO HELP!!! The pool is not fancy. Nor are the rooms but they work. Kids didn't complain. You can order movies& games on the TV as well. I'm forever grateful to this hotel. If you want a resort and a fancy place then don't forget your in Maui & if that's what you want. Expect to pay well over 200$ a night. Grand Wilea I once paid 600$!!!!! No joke.

We researched several hotels on the island but chose the Maui Beach Hotel based on price and location. The rooms were not fancy but were clean and had all of the basics as expected. We had a room that faced out towards the road but the view of the mountains was still very pretty. We always felt safe within the hotel and on the grounds. For two women traveling in unfamiliar territory that is a huge plus. The location was perfect as we were centrally located in the island so no matter where we were headed it seemed quick and easy to get there. It was 2 hours to Haleakala Crater, 40 min to Lahaina. There was also a Starbucks at the mall across the street which helped on those early mornings. When it was time to check out we were able to leave our bags at the hotel at 2:30am on our way to the crater for sunrise and then returned at 7pm to pick them up from the locked storage area before heading to the airport for our flight home. The staff were always helpful and prompt. The parking was great and we usually had close spaces available. Only once when they were hosting an event in e bar on Sat night did we have to park at the very far end of the lot. Overall, we viewed the hotel as a stopping point to grab some sleep in between different activities around the island and weren't looking for a romantic or especially fancy place.

After a wonderful stay in a fabulous resort in Kaanapali, my 84-year old mother fell and was taken to the hospital up the street from the Maui Beach Hotel. The hospital social worker was kind enough to suggest this hotel, which was close to the hospital. I was not sure how many nights I would need the hotel, but from the hospital, called each day before 11:00 a.m. (their check-out deadline) to reserve the room for another night. By late in the evening, each night when returning to the hotel, I learned that my room was no longer available and I would have to relocate. This happened 3 times! Each time the hotel front-desk staff was rude and discourteous. Since the hospital food was not very good, I had purchased and stored a few items in the refrigerator in my room to take to my Mother, which were stolen by the housekeeping staff! When I complained, no apology or restitution was offered and the Manager would not return my calls. As a single woman, I never felt safe staying there. The parking lot was dimly lit and frequently occupied by people loitering late in the evening. The rooms were tacky and dirty. The bed was uncomfortable, the air-conditioner barely functioned and was noisy. The room smelled of mildew and the hallways reeked of cigarette smoke.

Upon seeing the room (#131), I was pleasantly surprised. The bathroom had been recently renovated and although the shower (no tub) and toilet are in close quarters, the sink and mirror area is very roomy.

The reason was that my flight was arriving in Kahului very late and it was one of the closest hotels to the airport offering budget accommodations. Overall, it was as another reviewer stated earlier, \"You get what you pay for.\" Check-in was quick and efficient. Because I booked through the website, I had prepaid my stay so there was no need for any additional paperwork. I believe motel would be a more appropriate description, as the decor throughout is extremely spartan. Hotel hallways are on the interiors, but the lighting is harsh overhead fluorescent bulbs. Note that although this is a two story structure, there is no convenient elevator to speak of, so if you have a lot of luggage, you must haul it up a pretty long flight of stairs. The room itself was basic, but comfortable. Again, motel-like with somewhat soft mattresses, cotton-poly blend sheets, and poly bed covers. The small bathroom also was simple, but recently remodeled. The tiny shower had pumps providing shower gel and combined shampoo and conditioner. Climate control was provided by a wall mounted air conditioner, which made it very difficult to adjust the room temperature (it was either too cold with it on or stuff and warm with it off). The room itself was quiet, but I think that was a factor of very few guests staying at the hotel. The few from the room looked out over the hotel's interior courtyard and onto the adjacent Kahului Bay. There is no real beach to speak of in terms of white sands and activity access. Overall it was as I expected: nothing wonderful, but nothing terrible. The hotel itself is very conveniently located to the main business districts of Kahului and Wailuku, so if you do have a late flight, you can stock up on supplies before heading off to further flung destinations. This was particularly convenient because I was headed for a two night stay in Hana and wanted to pick up some goods for my journey.

First of all, it is nowhere near the beach. This was not a problem for us because we'd rented a car, but anyone staying here should realize that a car rental is a must. The hotel is located on a highway in an industrial/retail area. The staff was not helpful when we asked them for suggestions of where to visit, so I will mention here that the charming plantation town of Pa'ai is a 15 minute drive, back past the airport. Just before Pa'ai is the Baldwin State Beach, a lifeguarded swimming beach with exciting (i.e., rough) surf. Hookipa Beach, a famous windsurfing beach, is a bit further down the road. The northern Maui beaches, near the bigger resorts, are accessible to the public. You need to drive about 45 minutes and find on-street parking, but this was also not a problem with a decent map. As for the hotel itself, when we arrived their key card machine was broken, so we needed to be escorted to our rooms every time we wanted to enter. A day later the machine was fixed. You need a card to access the hotel rooms-- yet the back door to the hotel was continually propped open to the parking lot with an orange traffic cone!

My stay there was a pleasant one because I didn't go there expecting a 'resort' atmosphere or amenities.. For around $70-$90, expect a small but comfortable and clean room close to the airport. The rooms are definitely NOT resort quality rooms. If you plan to stay there; keep in mind that the rooms are budget minded, no frills rooms. This would be a hotel which you would stay if you have a early flight out or use to pretty much strictly shower and sleep while on vacation. The people working at the hotel were wonderful and very nice. The beach in back of the hotel is definitely NOT a swimming beach, NOR is it one for romantic strolls during sunrise/sunset. It is actually a harbor and there appeared to be some homeless or squatter camps in the bushes to the right and the aftermath of several parties at the left of the beach next to the road. Anyways...there are so many other beaches to visit and explore on the island. The best thing about this hotel is the value and free shuttle to the airport.", "Date": "August 12, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui", "Title": "\u201cLizards are good luck\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1151498", "Content": "In response to the previous review-- Anyone coming to Maui may encounter \"LIZARDS\" they are called \"GECKO'S\" here, and are actually a sign of good luck. They eat pesky night flying bugs and are totally harmless. They probably occur at even the Grand Wailea, so please think of them as a positive thing instead of a negative.

The hotel is 3 stars maybe for the '60 years! The rooms aren't so spacios as it is seen on the internet,the furniture and the carpet seem old,so seems the air conditioning device,too. There is only shower (those rooms with bath tub are deluxe,so more expensive!!),no cofee maker- things that usually exist in hotels not very expensive in America. And the worst thing - was a LIZARD in my room,on my purse!! And the stuff laughed when we asked for somebody to come to remove him!!Nobody said sorry,nobody apologised. And their presentation was very unrealistic,there was no beach good for swimming around,the hotel is on the bay,the port is nearby. Maybe I would have liked the hotel more if I had read the truth in their advertisment.", "Date": "July 15, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cIs this renovated?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR993711", "Content": "This \"renovated\" hotel was truly a disappointment.

Great spot to kick back and relax before or after your days outing. The rooms are your standard motel fare, as is the restaurant and bar. Clean and sufficient for travellers to Maui who aren't going to spend a lot of time in their rooms. The best part about this motel is it's location and price. Within walking distance (or a very short drive) of shops, restaurants and a cinema, this motel is located minutes from the airport and is so central on the island that everything is within a short one hour drive or less! (with the exception of Hana). We got a garden level room for $70/night.
